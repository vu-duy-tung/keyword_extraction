This bread did not taste that great straight out of the bag. However, once I doctored it up, it was very nice. After brushing with roasted garlic olive oil, oven toasting and sprinkling with salt and pepper, it made a great base for bruschetta and artisan cheeses. However, I would not spend $6-$7 again for a loaf of bread that needs this much work.   Based on other yelp reviews, I will be back at least one more time to try their lunch sandwiches.",

I thought to myself that I had to try that out for myself, and sure enough the dish is called the chicken and the egg. Some 7 minutes later and a few sips of coffee, my order came and I was drooling. Fried chicken tenders with melted cheese and a poached egg, each over a biscuit and drizzled with syrup. Oh my goodness it was amazing! Like \"shut the front door and just let me stuff my face\" good. I decided to dig into the egg first but I'll let you choose which to eat first, the chicken or the egg. For $9 I couldn't have been happier. For sides, I would recommend the house made chips. They were tastier than the healthier cucumber option.",

    "text": "Local ingredients. When I say local, I don't just mean local to Charlotte or the surrounding areas, I mean local to the 7th Street Public Market. These guys are using tons of products directly within the market and using them rather well. Coffee from Not Just Coffee, salt(s) from Salts of the Earth, produce from the market, and so on. It's the market's little microcosm of local perfection.   Hailing from a history of bread baking and jiving with freshly baked bread of any sort, this is the holy grail of local purveyors for yours truly. I love bread. I'll say it again -- I love bread. Wait....Let me reiterate that -- I LOVE BREAD. Adam, owner/Chef, makes some killer breads. Namely, the Pecorino Romano blows my mind every time. We've taken home a few loaves, I've had it on the Cuban sandwich, and we've even paired it with some chili at home. Stellar execution on that recipe.   Now serving breakfast and lunch -- the menu is tremendous. Can't speak too much to the breakfast items, but lunch is wondrously perfect. I've had the Cuban and the veggie sandwich. The Cuban is heavy, packed with tons of great stuff. Love the pulled pork and the lighter pickles. The mustard concoction is so complex and makes for a flavor dynamic that keeps your palate on the edge of your seat. Served on the Pecorino Romano alongside the clam chowder -- winner. I loved every bit of it and it was a great lunch. The veggie was equally legendary. Whatever that corn spread is brought tears of joy to my eyes.   Also love the cooler packed with fun bottled sodas -- Sunkist, root beer, Cheerwine, and others.   Focus: Bread, bread, bread. There is so much love, thought, and expertise put into every loaf. Do yourself a favor and pick one up next time you're at the market.",

    "text": "Woah, consider me pretty blown away after one visit to Local Loaf. The Chicken & the Egg and the BLT were both incredible sandwiches. I ordered the BLT, which comes with fried green tomatoes, bacon, popcorn shoots, and white pimento cheese. To call this sandwich a BLT is honestly a bit of a stretch, the star of the show was definitely the pimento cheese. The bacon was cooked perfectly- not super floppy but not overdone and crunchy either and the fried green tomatoes added a little crunch and good flavor. There were very few popcorn shoots, however, and with the tomatoes being fried it didn't really remind me of a BLT much. This doesn't mean the sandwich wasn't good though because the white pimento cheese was incredible. You could put it on 2 week old Wonder bread and still make a tasty sandwich. As good as the BLT was, the chicken & the egg biscuit might have been even better! The biscuit was nice and fluffy, the cheddar added a nice dimension, and the poached egg was perfectly cooked and burst open as soon as my girlfriend cut into the sandwich. The best part by far though was the chicken. The chicken tenders were heavily spiced, but the chipotle Cheerwine sauce provided the perfect balance of sweet. I would order these tenders at just about any restaurant on their own; adding in the biscuit, cheese, and egg just made it incredible.  The prices were very reasonable as well, especially for a farm to fork location with very high quality ingredients. My only complaint is that when I ordered I didn't mention sides for either sandwich and the cashier never asked, so my girlfriend and I assumed sides were extra and weren't worried about getting any. Instead we later realized we could've chosen between cucumber salad, chips, or soup ($1 more for soup) but instead were just given chips which neither of us really wanted. Overall, I can't complain much about this, I just wish the cashier had asked us our choice (or we had read the menu better haha).",

The hubster and I each got a Palli  (vegetarian) sandwich: cooked spinach, sweet grilled red bell peppers, olive oil, and a thick slice of melty mozzarella on freshly made focaccia. We got a side of house-made chips. After paying and receiving our table marker, we went over to Not Just Coffee for their \"to die for\" lattes w/almond milk. The sandwiches were brought to us about four minutes after we started sipping our lattes.  Everything was delicious! The sandwiches were simple, tasty, and though vegetarian were quite hearty. The bread was fresh; soft and flavorful in the middle with a perfect crisp crust. We both enjoyed the chips too. Yes, there were a couple that were dark and bitter but the majority were a delicious compliment to our sandwiches: very lightly salted so you can actually taste potato. I think the sandwich could be even better with a couple thick slices of grilled portobello mushrooms brushed with a little BBQ sauce.  A perfect dessert afterwards was chocolates from barChocolate...(^.^)",

The steak pieces were also weirdly large for a cheesesteak.

Adam and his staff are always unfriendly and inattentive. This morning I decided to give them another go after many bad experiences with cold \"biscuits\" that look like dinner rolls and long waits and again they served a cold biscuit after a 10 minute wait and others being served ahead of me. I think they have potential but they do not care about their customers. For all my bad experiences I have never been apologized to or asked if I wanted my money back. I have given them so many chances and today is the last straw.   Don't go here. Bring your own breakfast to the market during the week or eat Cookie Cult cookies from NJC.",

The flat boards they serve the food on is also irritating because the food kinda flows where ever. My salty over easy eggs had their yolks cracks and the yolk ended up on the server because the stupid boards don't have sides to hold the food together. Won't waste any more money here.   Also, why would ANYONE who wants to support a misogynistic owner who treats people like sh*t?",

I grabbed a latte at Not Just Coffee across the aisle-way and was able to explore a few shops in the back. The food was very good. I had the chicken & the egg and thought it was delicious. The Cheerwine sauce added a fun, local touch. I had the grits as a side, and they were okay. My boyfriend had the steak & egg sandwich. It was super yummy and very hearty. The only negative was it got very messy at the end.. Trying to take a bite without everything sliding off was a feat. He had the cucumber salad as a side and was pleased. I loved that everything was served on the stamped wooden boards. We went at 8:30 a.m. on a Sunday, and there were several empty tables. We had our food within 10 minutes. Prices were very reasonable, and we got 2 meals for less than $25. We also found lots of free parking as the meters are only enforced Monday-Friday, but they do validate for the garage next door. Definitely worth stopping in.",

To our surprise , the gravy had a distinct curry flavor, which added an interesting touch. Though the portion wasn't huge, we didn't end up being able to finish it because of the unexpectedly powerful flavor. I love that they also bake their own bread for this stand, and would definitely try a lunch sandwich on a fresh slice of wheat bread when I visit again!  This place is also nice because it's in the public market, so there are many different options if you're with a group of people. I think it would be a great lunch option in a weekend afternoon, and will keep it in mind when I'm back in the area!",

It's a bit difficult to find (located in the 7th Street Public Market), but well worth it!  Like Chick-Fil-A?   Try to the chicken and egg sandwich....holy S!  DETAILED:  This place is located in the 7th Street Public Market.  Don't try to Waze it or Google Maps it, both took me to wrong places.  Go to the Epicenter, take a left from Trade, then go two blocks and take a right.  Go inside the Public Market and it's the first place on the right inside.  The menu is somewhat limited, but they do a great job with what they offer.  Having recently moved to Charlotte from California, Chick-Fil-A's chicken and egg biscuits have been a local treat.  This one is on STEROIDS!  They give you a home-made biscuit, hand-breaded chicken tenders, micro greens, a poached egg and Cheerwine (which is a Southern soda for those of you not from the South) reduction glaze.  So dope!!!  The people were friendly at the counter.  I called ahead and they actually got the order right (not a knock on them, many other places screw up takeout orders - I guess b/c they figure you won't notice until you're back at home/work).    The other stuff looks good too.  Give it a shot, I don't think you will be disappointed.  Oh yeah, and they serve breakfast all day, which is a plus in my book!",

I have eaten both breakfast and lunch here. For breakfast, I typically stick to the breakfast burrito because it is just amazing. Chorizo, egg, peppers, sweet potato, cheese.....mix made in heaven! I have heard that the steak and egg and chicken and egg are both real good as well. For lunch, I have had the broccoli burger and the french dip (that was on special one day). The broccoli burger is absolutely fantastic. I mean, you don't even notice that the patty is made of veggies! It has a sriracha ketchup on it that is perfection. It is actually my go to on the menu! For sides, you get to choose from pickles cucumbers, house made chips, or a cup of soup. Typically I go for the chips or their soup of the day. The soups are always fantastic! The house made chips are some of the best tasting chips I have ever had.   Run, don't walk, to this place. Order anything on the menu cause you can't go wrong here!",

I felt it was my duty to get \"The Chicken and the Egg,\" being from Salisbury and all (home of Cheerwine). Let me tell you it did not disappoint. Biscuit was perfect, chicken was perfect, and everything tasted great together. Warning: this is not an eat with your hands sandwich-- way too huge and messy. Knife and fork it is. BF got the \"Steak and Egg\" and it was great as well.   We also ordered a loaf of their sourdough to take home. So fresh out of the oven they couldn't even slice for us.

    "text": "My husband and I's first experience with this restaurant was out of this world Excellent! However, since then I have since noticed a serious decline in the quality of service and the quality of food. The staff is beyond rude to the customers whether they are busy or not. With said rudeness they still manage to demand a tip and proceed to get a serious attitude if not a big enough tip is given. The last time my husband and i went during the weekend the poached egg was extremely undercooked and gave both my husband and i food poisoning for the weekend. With all that being said i decided to give them another try today. I figured going during a weekday i would get better results. WRONG. Same rude service and same quality of food. My lyon potatoes which costs me an extra 2.00 was unrecognizably over cooked. I am saddened to take this place off of my list of eating establishments however, until big changes are made it has to be done.",

The pancakes are probably the best I've ever had (crispy on outside, chewy inside), burrito had delicious seasoning, and the Jalapeno queso on my perfectly toasted cheesesteak baguette was awesome. Can't wait to come back...",

The soup is different each time I've been, but I've always liked what was served. I do have to say one thing about their soups - no matter what kind it is, you can bet it will be spicy! I'm not weak when it comes to my spice tolerance, but 2 out of the 4 soups I've tried have caused me to tear up. The other two just caused me to need an extra napkin for my nose. The soups are definitely spicy, but I still eat every bite.",

    "text": "I have to say, I wasn't quite pleased with my food here at Local Loaf. I had the Chicken and Egg biscuit. It was a mess. The poached egg (perfectly poached) was on the bottom side of the biscuit and I don't know if it was cut unevenly or what, but it seemed like part of the biscuit was missing. The chicken...way over seasoned! I don't like bland food, but I'd rather be able to add to it if need be. The seasoning on the chicken combined with the chipotle glaze was just too heavy on the salt scale for me. One of the chefs told me the chicken tenders are hand breaded...I can appreciate that, but it was all bread. Hardly any chicken under all the breading. Hate to say this but, I've had more substantial chicken tenders at Bojangles. That really made me sad. I had to eat it with a knife and fork and I was searching for the chicken and some aged cheddar flavor. The biscuit...no. No buttery flavor and not very flakey. It was almost dry. Not a \"southern\" biscuit by any means. My breakfast biscuit came with chips and they had some soggy almost wet spots on them. I'm guessing it was grease or something (I hope). Not quite sure. I think Local Loaf needs to go back to the drawing board on this one, or maybe I caught them at a bad time. I will go back to try a fresh loaf of bread. I kind of wish I could have my $8 (almost) $9 back for that biscuit. :(",

Flavor, texture all just right. It is $6.50 for two so they had better be good!   The only downside is that they serve all of their food on cutting boards. This works well for a sandwich, but not as well for things that have runny eggs or syrup. Both times my wife was not able to utilize her syrup well because pouring the syrup would have made it run off the cutting board onto the table.",

Hands down, the 'Chicken and the Egg' is the best breakfast biscuit I've ever eaten. The chicken had a fantastic scald. The poached egg was cooked to order and to perfection (which I'm weird about how my poached egg is cooked so, this is high praise). The chicken and egg combined with the grilled toasted biscuit, aged white cheddar, and chipotle cheerwine sauce was a culinary balance without relying on heavy salt to make an impression. Served with house-made potato chips, this plate is a high fly, out of the park, home run.   The regular glazed donut was the surprise of the order. It was not sicky sweet and/or dense as in your standard donut fare; but rather it had an airy, meaty quality making it enjoyable to chew and wanting to savor every bite. Seriously, when was the last time you wanted to savor a donut? It's that good.   The mixed berry muffin was tasty and is solid to stand on its own if you need a muffin fix. But, it was so overshadowed by the donut and biscuit it did not get very much attention. We left half on the plate at the end of the meal.   If you are visiting the uptown Charlotte area or live in the area, make time to visit Local Loaf for breakfast. And, although we did not eat from the lunch/dinner menu, I imagine these items will not disappoint.",

    "text": "Inside 7th Street Market among the many MANY options available to you I personally find Local Loaf to be the best. The name initially sounds deceiving, not to mention the loaves of delicious bread lying about. Don't fret, they serve meals and sides not just loaves of baked goodness.  You won't be disappointed by the various concoctions they throw up here on the daily. They even have specials on the best days. This past weekend I had a lightly cooked tuna steak (raw in the middle = great!) topped with bacon, avocado and an over-easy egg between two giant halves of toast. It was a fantastic meal especially for the price (less than $15 - not bad considering the size of that tuna cut). When not looking at the specials there are plenty of salad concoctions, breakfast sandwiches and tasty burgs. Probably the most ubiquitous item of note here is the chicken and the egg sandwich(?) that is more of a fork and knife sandwich. So good!  They seem to drop an over-easy egg on several of their menu items which ends up making most of the sandwiches fork+knife (as I mentioned above). On that note, while the wooden cutting boards make for a truly neat serving platter they do not work with the runny over easy egg. Be warned: you will dirty the tables when you break the yolk. I think they'd do well to pick and choose how they serve certain dishes here. Otherwise, I highly recommend grabbing your weekend lunch at Local Loaf. Then run over to Viva Raw or Not Just Coffee for a drink.",

After making a round and checking out what people were eating, I decided that this place looked the best. I ordered the Chicken & the Egg - hand breaded chicken tenders, white cheddar, poached egg, and microgreens on a southern buttermilk biscuit and topped with chipotle sauce. The dish itself looks so good, it's what initially caught my eye when I saw someone else in the marketplace eating it. I'm such a sucker for fried chicken so I was definitely in foodie heaven with this sammy.",

I ordered the Chicken & the Egg with a side of Broccoli Cheddar soup, I wish they served Hash Browns as a side option but this is a smaller space so the menu is limited. This is considered their signature sandwich - chicken tenders, white cheddar, a poached egg, microgreens and a Cheerwine sauce pilled high on a biscuit. It was delicious and filling, the only downside is it was difficult to eat (it was pilled too high and the biscuit was difficult to cut with a knife). The soup was ah-mazing, one of the best Broccoli Cheddar soups that I have consumed. Plus, look at that presentation! I definitely recommend Local Loaf!",

    "text": "Second time trying the Local Loaf, exactly one year later, and ordered the Chicken and the Egg again. It was a little disappointing this time unfortunately. I felt like the fried chicken wasn't as flavorful or big in size as the last time, and it lacked some of the sweetness we had previously. Biscuits are still pretty good though I would have preferred less salt.   The biggest frustration was when I ordered an additional side of cucumber salad, but the servers were a bit careless when they prepared my order. I got a large side, though I saw a smaller container, and the server just explained that they ran out of lids for the larger and just gave me some extra on the side with the entree. Well the entree is already supposed to come with a small side, and I discovered that they didn't give me any additional cucumbers to make up for the rest. The server insisted that there was more in the other container w/ the entree, so I took her word for it. Unfortunately this is they type of thing that makes restaurant servers seem inexperienced. I could have gone back to complain but sometimes it's just more trouble than it's worth. They should have got it right the first time. Sigh!",

It is most definitely a heavy start to the day, but what more could a couple of travelers want really.  The bakery is located in the market and so is effectively just a counter front. There's a huge board with a big array of sandwiches, waffles, fried chicken etc. you place your order, take your number and the food is delivered to you.  We tried their take in the croque monsieur, a Cuban & chicken on biscuit. All were very tasty, but definitely heavy and a bit oily. You can chose a side - the home baked chips were delicious! So, if have done your exercise for the month, this is an excellent spot to eat!",

When the owner (Adam) tells a customer that he doesn't care if he ever comes back, he doesn't know the meaning of customer service. Especially when his kitchen messed up my order not one, not two, but three times. Actually, I never received half my order.  After receiving half my order, my girlfriend never received her order (after over an hour waiting).   To tell you the truth, the food is above average. But decent food without good service is not a place I want to patronage. The service was beyond horrible!!  Even though the servers were apologetic each time I spoke with them about my order, it was never fixed.  And then to top it off the owner gives me attitude!?! The correct response to a customer should be, \"I apologize for the mix up, how can I fix it?\"  Instead, I got attitude with a response that \"you're probably not going to come back and I don't care\". Maybe he was just having a bad day. Either way, I DON'T CARE!!!!  I'm a customer who had paid for a meal, and didn't receive what I paid for.",

I wasn't sure about the chipotle cheer wine sauce but the bf said he thought he'd had it before & it adds a hint of sweet to the sauce. He was correct because it gave the sandwich a sweet spicy finish. The side of homemade potato chips were the perfect tiny handful so I cannot wait to try another sandwich. Good service & fabulous breakfast sandwich!!",

The girl recommended the breakfast burrito over the biscuit and gravy so I got that and the bf got the chicken and the egg. He absolutely loved his and j was pretty jealous of his food. Oh also both came with the choice of chips or cucumber and vinegar salad. we both chose chips and they were awesome! My issue was with my burrito. It was cooked just as I order and was very hot but there was absolutely no flavor to it. It had green peppers black beans corn chorizo jack cheese in it and it honestly had zero flavor. I had to go to the counter and get a side of Siracha to put on it in order to eat half of it. It just was meh. I was expecting so much more because the chicken and egg that my bf got was great. We also went back to get muffins to take home since those came recommended. I got blueberry and he got carrot and cinnamon. Mine was good he didn't really like his. We both agreed that it would've been better served warm instead of cold. I would come here again though to order a different menu item! Great service also!",

You could even score one meal from Local Loaf and another from the Crepe place about ten steps away to split.  We tried the Chicken and the Egg, Biscuits and Gravy and a make your own omelet.   We sat at tables in the center of the market and waited maybe ten minutes for the food to come out. You could grab something from Not Just Coffee while waiting on shop the market.  I haven't always liked biscuits and gravy but I must say the ones here were enough to convert anyone. They do their bread right at Local Loaf and the sausage gravy could convert vegetarians.   Big fan of the Chicken and Egg- I had them pick for me and I was pleased with this. Not too big not too small, perfectly executed egg, Cheerwine sauce giving it a sweet/savory thing with the fried chicken. Comes with a small side of cucumber salad or house made chips.   if you want something remarkable for brunch (or any other meal but I feel like the wait may be longer then) check out Local Loaf.  Their food is local (does that go without saying?) and you won't fight the crowds for brunch.",

I wouldn't call the food here authentic French cuisine, but it is very good and the portion sizes are huge. They definitely cook everything with the quality you'd expect from French cuisine and give you the portion sizes you'd expect in America. I came here early Sunday morning for breakfast. Seating is limited in the market, so plan accordingly. They do validate parking! So park in the parking deck. Because it's located in the market, you can get coffee and other foods from the other vendors there.   For breakfast, I had the chicken and the egg. It is the French take on a chicken egg biscuit, and it was amazing. The freshly breaded and fried chicken tenders were juicy, crunchy, and seasoned so well. They sat on top a flat top grilled biscuit, and the chicken was covered in an awesome melted white cheddar and Cheerwine chipotle sauce. The sauce was sweet with a touch of spice and combined with the incredible cheddar, the flavor profile was just unreal. You also get a poached egg and some micro greens. I chose to get a side of grits, which were also cheesy and tasty.   Overall, I would highly recommend trying Local Loaf for breakfast. The chicken biscuit was huge, very flavorful, making it the perfect way to start your morning.",

Do I was surprised it was a blueberry Waffle when it came out. I don't eat blueberry. So I would've appreciated if they would've just mentioned what the flavor of the day was, because it wasn't posted anywhere and they only serve that flavor, there were no plain waffle options. The server was not happy when I said I didn't want it. But she resolved the issue by bringing me a pancake which was different because they actually deep fry their pancakes. It was pretty good. The eggs, grits, and bacon were ok.   They also have a giant donut that was pretty tasty as well.",

They also make breakfast staples like egg sandwiches, pancakes (they have a red velvet pancake right now that looks magnifique), and other morning time delectables. Their decor evokes a modern workmanlike bakery, and this is reflected in the quality of their fare. I had a butterscotch white chocolate muffin that I saved for later.  2 hours later when I ate it  (with cold brew because, yes, I am that guy) it was still bakery fresh.   I recommend asking for the social of the day. They sometimes have 2 choices, and you can't really go wrong with a muffin... You know,  on cheat day...",

    "text": "I've been here twice now and both meals were flawless. This small unassuming bakery is situated inside the 7th Street Public Market. My usual style is to try something different each time I visit a place like this so the fact that I've eaten at Local Loaf 2x (and still haven't tried that nice looking Italian place or the creperie) is significant.   At Local Loaf you can order your food and have it served to you outside in a super casual environment making this an excellent stop after some time with your kiddos at Imaginon next door.   The burgers at Local Loaf are some of the best around; fresh baked artisanal breads, very high quality meat, and creative toppings - paired with homemade chips - all blend together to create a mouth watering treat.   But don't stop there. A few days ago we had the special sandwich...marinated pork belly cooked to perfection and garnished with small bits of chicharrones. This was served on a peanut butter bun...not a bun with peanut butter on it but a bun with PB cooked into it! Combined with this heavenly Sriracha cream sauce and lettuce it made for a very unique (and delicious) sandwich experience.  Staff at Local Loaf are very friendly and the facility is always clean and tidy. Plus, with prices this reasonable, t's not hard to become a repeat customer at Local Loaf.",

    "text": "This restaurant is a gem! I had an excellent breakfast here over the weekend and their delicious food and generous portions already have me wanting to come back. Local Loaf is located inside 7th Street Public Market along with several other local businesses.  The duck and waffle in other yelp reviews is what brought me here, but I didn't see it on the menu during our visit. But no problem, they had some other tasty items to try! I ordered the Croque Madame, which is honestly a cheese lover's dream breakfast. Melty cheese on the inside AND the outside! Also, you could tell the quality of the bread was really good. The sandwich was huge and I could only eat about 2/3rds of it. I even enjoyed the unique presentation of the sandwich on a cool wooden board, instead of the typical tray.   We had no problems with crowds or seating since we arrived right when they opened, but I can see that seating could become more difficult during lunch as the other restaurants start to open for the day too. Also, I know parking downtown can be a little tricky. I wish we had known that you can park in the deck next to 7th Street Public Market and have your ticket validated inside the market. If you do, then you get your first 90 minutes of parking for free! We'll definitely be doing this next time, instead of driving around downtown trying to find free street parking.",

The egg was perfect as well.   Much better option for me than Taste, but perhaps I'd try something different from the menu next time.

A VERY small  (size of plain loaf bread) sandwich that had practically no meat. The little bit of corned beef was chopped, like it was for hash. There wasn't even the equivalent of  of 2 regular slices of meat. Sandy said it looked like what you get from a can.   There were gobs of the dressing which tasted like mustard, some cheese and a little kraut. The bread was ok, but I wouldn't pay $9 for 2 small slices of bread. Again, very disappointed!   Probably won't be back! And, no, I don't work for the competition.  I will say, it was one of the only places with no line.",

The chicken tenders were the quality of any chain restaurant-overbreaded and stringy. The BBQ sauce was way to sweet-I could barely detect any flavor over the sweetness. The biscuit was pretty good considering. I also tried the croque monsieur. The ham was so incredibly sweet it was gross. The \"bread\" was like a sweet burned pancake.   And for the grand finale......the chips were burned. On both orders. They were the color of a chocolate bar. I think with chain restaurants they put a lot of sugar in everything because that is the perceived american palette..but this place is not a chain, so I expected good food and I was very disappointed.",

We decided to eat at Local Loaf for breakfast. We both ended up ordering the Chicken and the Egg sandwhich. Let me start of by saying that I did like it, despite the difficulty in eating it.  The biscuit that served as the base for the meal was good not great. A little crumbly when trying to carry the weight of all the filling and fell apart more than once. The breaded chicken tenders were quite astounding and way more flavorful than expected. I like the Cheerwine glaze/sauce but felt that it overpowered the other flavors. Unless you ate the chicken on its own, you couldn't discern it from the sauce. I also would have preferred something other than sprouts but I also couldn't even taste them.      For future reference, might I recommend NOT attempting to eat this as a sandwich but more open-faced style.    I will be back to sample more tasty meals here in future.",

    "text": "You only get one chance to make a first impression, and this restaurant/bakery, being at the front of the 7th St. Public Market, does a fine job of impressing.    With a focus on using local ingredients, including produce and spices from other market purveyors, Local Loaf crafts a number of fantastic sandwiches and pastries for both breakfast and lunch.  With a recently expanded breakfast menu, you can order just about anything you like, from fresh fried eggs to sinfully fluffy biscuits topped with local honey.  Count me as a particular fan of their seasonal scones, including peach and chocolate/raspberry, as of late.  Combined with a cup of artisan coffee just a few steps away, that's a proper way to get your morning started.    Not that the heartier sandwiches play second fiddle here.  The proof of quality here is in the details.  For example, the common chicken and egg biscuit is elevated to the next level with a sweet and spicy glaze sauce and micro greens to add a bit of freshness to the final product.  And while I am no fan of buffets, in general, I have tried the Sunday brunch buffet here and the attention to quality is just as apparent and made for quite a satisfying meal.  Ordering is easy at the counter and all entrees are delivered wherever you most like to sit at the market, even at the coffee bar across the way.  Just take your number with you and the staff brings your order to you, on a nice butcher block that feels just as artisan as the craft fare that sits atop it.  Do check out the breads all baked in house too.  The baguette is phenomenal and there are several specialty breads that change with the days and the seasons, so feel free to ask the staff what's fresh.  Local Loaf is a welcome addition to the market and it's great to see independent businesses with such a showcase to show off their talents.  These guys have easily earned their spot up front.",

I ordered the chef veggie sandwich based off my craving for the honey chipotle hummus spread listed as part of the sandwich on the menu. I picked the cucumber salad as my side. What a winning combo!! Not only were the veggies and bread super fresh, but the hummus did not disappoint. The cucumber salad was a great combo of vinegar and dill, which I could have slurped up in its entirety if I wasn't in a public setting. So good!!! I'm glad Jerris (spelling?) took my order even though they looked like they were closing shop. Not only was the food delicious, but the customer service set the standard for southern hospitality. I want to come back and taste the ham & brie sandwich, which was my second choice off the menu. A++++",

    "text": "This is a review of the service and food service practices of the restaurant, not the food itself.   I came here for the first time today and ordered a veggie burger and cucumber salad. I was given a number (32) and took a seat at a table. After waiting 30 minutes for my food I got up and asked about it. I was told they were preparing it at that time. When I asked if it usually takes 30 minutes they said that they were in the process of cleaning up to close so it was probably just taking that long because they were multitasking.   They then brought the burger out and showed me a receipt to prove to me that I had not been waiting 30 minutes. However, the number on the receipt (38) was not my number (32) so I told them that is what I ordered but they should check to make sure they weren't giving me someone else's because that was not my number.  A few minutes later they walked over to another table where they had set a plate of food down at least 15 mins prior. They took that back behind the counter and then took it to the person who had the number on the receipt they showed me.  I had watched them set the food down initially and took the number (34) that was sitting on the empty table. Nobody was at the table but they left it there anyway. I kept looking over and nobody ever came for that food. This being my first time I didn't know that what they sat down was a veggie burger. It seems like they made an error in the numbers and left my food at an empty table. Then when I asked about mine they gave me someone else's order. Then gave that person the burger that had been sitting out unattended for at least 15 minutes!   I will not be returning here after seeing them serve someone food like that!!  Update: As I spent my whole 30 mins waiting facing the register I know there were no more than 5-10 customers during my time waiting. At no point was there ever a line. Even if this small number is what you consider \"high volume\" for your establishment, that does not justify serving a customer food that has been unattended sitting out in the public area where anyone could have tampered with it for over 15 minutes. My review was not of the 30 minute wait, but of the unsanitary practices of your establishment that you chose not to acknowledge in your response.",

I got the chicken and the egg biscuit and the biscuit might as well have been a hockey puck. You're in the south and that's like the one thing that should have been right!! No light flaky fluffy biscuit from a bread company?!?? The chicken was okay but nothing great and the cackalacky cheerwine sauce (sp?) was spicy (a good thing) but sooo overly salty and then sickeningly sweet on top of that. Just did not like it at all. My boyfriend got an omelette and well it was ridiculously over cooked. When it arrived it was brown... Basically I'll probably never eat here again.",

I took my first bite of my sandwich and it tasted a little burnt so I looked at the bottom of the bread and it was charcoal. They put that burnt side down on the bottom, but the top half looked fine. That is just unforgivable. If you burn the bread, re-fire. Don't try to hide it! The egg on the sandwich was also raw. Not over easy - raw. Most of the \"white\" was totally clear, the yolk was room temperature. It was disgusting. The other sandwich was dry and the steak was tough and over-cooked. I had a couple of the homemade chips they put on the side. The first couple were tasty, but the rest were burnt and bitter tasting. Other sandwich tasted decent but the bread they chose didn't work for such a wet sandwich and the bread became a soggy, crumbling sponge. One of the worst experiences trying a new place.  They clearly don't respect their customers and don't mind sending out inedible food. Horrible.",

Biscuits and gravy could have used better planning on my part. Came on a board with two eggs up and no hash browns to gush into the yolks (proud of myself that I didn't end up wearing it.) Quite good but I think the rue got away from the cook on this one as the gravy as a bit brown. Thick cut firm bitey bacon Wanted a donut but no, nutz! Opted for a coffee cake muffin which was almost as good (hint: no donuts left but several muffins) and also came on a board. very very odd.",

Breakfast burrito also very good.   From what I understand the grill has only been open for the last 7 weeks.  With the new grill, they'll have some good opportunity to improve as well.   I think they're going to need more seating, at least one more employee, and a place people can wait when they're getting there food. You can make more money if you emphasize the going in and out atmosphere, rather than sitting down inside and eating.  I would change the theme and tempo, and keep doing what you have been and #1 focus on the premium food.",

An interesting \"market,\" that I would call more of a food court close to the financial district, but you'll find one or two interesting stores to walk through... And, when you get hungry, you've got plenty of options as we did.   Local Loaf was the clear winner in terms of what I wanted to eat, but I was hesitant knowing this place was a \"bakery\" and I was going to order a burger, but the Local Loaf Burger with the \"salad\" was great! Don't worry if you don't like salad, it's actually pickles!",

I came to 7th street market for a work lunch with colleagues and was really disappointed by the service. I ordered a Falafel Burger, and my order came out as a Portabella Sandwich (not even a burger, not the same thing, not at all). I took the food back up to the register. They looked up my order number and sure enough, they confirmed that I had ordered a falafel burger. They had no explanation for the mix up but said that they would get my burger out to me \"within two minutes.\"  I sat back down with a new number. Ten minutes later, my burger comes out. Now, I can understand some mistakes, but they honestly did not seem to care at all that I had been given the wrong food and they definitely did not try to remedy the situation quickly. Excellent service would have been offering me a discount on my next visit, offering a side/dessert/other token,e tc. Mediocre would have been getting me my burger within two minutes. But this was just plain poor.  Also, the falafel burger really wasn't that good and really disappointing after my now 30 minutes wait for it. The cucumber salad was decent, though.",

The Chicken & The Egg: the BF's favorite sandwich in Charlotte. It's 1/2 open-faced chicken sandwich and half open-faced egg sandwich; SO CLEVER! Between the crispy fried chicken (which he declared his favorite EVER, a bold statement), the cheerwine sauce, the buttery biscuit and the perfectly cooked egg, it left him speechless for the entire breakfast.   They are one of the few places that brings your food straight to your table, and service was extremely kind! We will definitely make this a repeat visit :)",

I switched the biscuit for a baguette, asked for my egg to be fried hard and asked for the cheerwine sauce on the side. When it arrived to the table they got my order right and everything was nice and hot!   But to be honest this sandwich is so good it deserves to be ordered with no modifications! Next time I'm ordering it just like they make it.   The chicken is very well seasoned and so crispy. And the cheerwine sauce is heavenly. I need them to bottle that up and sell it!

    "text": "So I'm all about the 7th Street Station Market.  Local Loaf makes a good \"anchor\" restaurant as far as breakfast and lunch options.  Now that my office has moved away from the center of town... 7thSS is probably the closest walk, without making lunch too terrible a hike.  I haven't had a breakfast here I haven't devoured in 5 min because it's so good.  The atmosphere in the weekday mornings is super relaxed and the folks here are friendly and get you your food quickly.  My favorite is the Chef's Waffles.  Since it's the chef's waffle flavor of the week... almost like roulette, but the outcome is great every time!  It comes with eggs and bacon.  Sandwiches and burgers are also on the menu.  Most (if not all food) is served on wooden cutting boards and you get plastic cutlery.  Oh yeah... they do have salads here too... but life is too short for salads... j/k.  Just make sure your salad has a side of burger!  Being next to the Lynx Station makes this a perfect way to start my day before hiking to the office.  If you drive in, the parking can be validated (with proof of purchase) here or at one of the other vendors.  It used to be honor system but some people took advantage and didn't help with small business (shakes head here).",

I came around lunch time and got the Green tomato BLT with the cucumber salad and my mom, who was with me, got the Fried Chicken Cobb. Our food was delivered to us in about 5 minutes and was nice and warm.   The Cobb salad looked out of this world and it was huge! It could easily be split with someone and the amount of avocado on it was outrageous- it had to be almost a full cado! The dressing was also delightful. However, the winner here was the BLT.  The sandwich was one of the best BLTs I've ever had. The green tomato was cooked to perfection and kind of tasted like it was breaded in quinoa. Very good. But I forgot to mention- it was topped off with their white pimento cheese! It was savory with a kick of flavor. The cucumber salad was also a great side choice, but they also offer house made chips or a side salad.  I can't believe I've lived in Charlotte for almost 4 years and have never been to Local Loaf- next time I'm getting a breakfast sandwich!!! They look and sound BOMB.",

The arugula gives a nice freshness. The cranberries and coconut add a nice sweetness but it balances out nicely with the curry sauce and onions.

They slice it and cover it with a homemade slightly spicy light brown gravy.... Not your typical white sawmill gravy. I liked it, though!

The gravy also went well with the eggs. I would visit again!",

I ordered pancakes, which were inedible when I received them as they had been burnt to a crisp. I showed them to the cashier who apologized and took care of it right away, getting me new pancakes and two free coconut macaroons. The food was good, but not great but I really appreciated their resolving the issue of the burnt pancakes: they are thin crusted, so they finish them in the oven to crisp them up so they must have left the first ones in the oven too long. I don't know if I'd come back for breakfast but I'd definitely get their pastries again. The price is really good too, $20 for two big breakfasts.",

I was lost down town, and I asked them for directions, they gave me accurate directions. After I got my cup of coffee, I decided to go to them for an afternoon snack.   The man who took my order was Jaris.(Like Paris with a J- like he said). He was wonderful, wonderful reccomendations and extremely professional.   The asiago croissant he treated me with was delightful, probably the best I've had in a while-- Speaking from a New Yorker's tastebud, of good food at local joints.  Yes, I'm going to drive about 25 minutes out of my way to get a croissant from Local Loaf, and for the service I experienced here. 10/10.",

    "text": "Food:  (5/5)  -  Local Loaf, obviously, bakes all kinds of fresh bread every day.  They better when they have the word \"loaf\" in their name, haha.  Sometimes, I don't even go there to order lunch.  I just get a few baguettes to-go and call it a day.  Other than the bread (which really is the backbone of every sandwich), they do a phenomenal job of creating fresh and unique sandwiches.  The Steak Sandwich is the one that really stands out for me.  Nice succulent cuts of beef, some sprouts, and perfect amount of homemade horseradish spread.  D...licious!  Oh yeah, homemade chips or cucumber salad with every sandwich, too!  They really do an excellent job of not over extending themselves and trying to create a crazy complex menu.  Sweet and simple - maybe ten things on there (bfast & lunch).  Atmosphere: (5/5) - It is located in the 7th Street Public Market in the corner nearest to the 7th street entrance.  This is a great location for socializing and a little shopping (see my 7th Street 5-star review).    Overall, you can't go wrong and everything on the menu is repeatable.  Enjoy!!  -Ian M.",

We instantly liked the vibrant atmosphere where locals and tourists mingle together looking for a delicious bite to eat. Local Loaf's unique menu caught my eye. I ordered the duck and waffles! The scrumptiously warm and soft Belgian-style waffles were perfectly paired with the yummy Jack Daniels maple syrup. I really enjoyed the perfectly fried Southern duck confit with the soft cotija cheese. My sister and brother-in-law enjoyed the flavorful Monte Cristo with the fried cinnamon ice cream. All the flavors simply burst in your mouth!",

    "text": "I was in the market today for lunch.  I decided to try Local Loaf and have to say, the jury's out for me. I went for the Steak Sandwich, it was very good.  For what it was I felt it was overpriced.  Marinated skirt steak, horseradish aioli, microgreens, and some kind of onions on a baguette.  The bread was good and freshly baked and it was a good sandwich but again there wasn't much to it.  I am understanding of the fact that they use good quality ingredients but for $10 I expected a bit more.  It was served with either chips or cucumber salad.  I must say that I loved the cucumber salad....tons of oregano (one of my favorite spices) and cucumbers and onions in a mildly sweet vinegar. My wife had the veggie sandwich which was served on jalapeno foccacia.  The bread was way overbaked and the crust of the bread was burnt.  It should not have been served.  She went to the counter to ask for different bread and one of the ladies commenced to argue with my wife for about 5 minutes about how the bread was slightly overbaked and some BS about eggwash caramelizing on the top causing a darkening effect.  This is a prime example of just because you have a chefs coat on, doesn't mean you know what the heck you're talking about.  She wound up getting a new piece of bread but it would have been better if she got it without an argument from the staff.  I like the market as a whole and this experience was just ok, IMO.  I wasn't taken aback by what I had at Local Loaf, but do appreciate and like the concept but for what they charge they should know that they have to step us the customer service and make sure everything their serving is top notch.",

Fortunately, the sign was outdated, because they were very much open.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, and it came with a poached egg on top. It was pretty dang tasty... the biscuit was flavorful and flaky, the chicken was moist and well-seasoned, and the egg added that extra deliciousness that only a runny yolk can. I only wish that the biscuit on which it was served had been a bit larger, since it got messy toward the end.   I'm glad to see Local Loaf in this space, and it will definitely become a regular weekend lunch spot.",

Service was okay, with a reasonably nice guy helping us at the counter. But the food and ambiance left a lot to be desired. The tables were dirty, probably because people can't be trusted to be decent and clean up after themselves at counter-style restaurants, but it would've been nice if an employee could wipe them down or something. The only clean table was a longer one that ONE PERSON was inexplicably taking up space at, so we sat there and made him share with us.   I ordered the bangers and mash. The sausages were greasy and not very flavorful. They covered the thing in fried onions but then had smaller spring onions (I think?), too. Apparently they really like those spring onions because they were similarly all over my wife's plate. I swear we had the exact same brown runny sauce on both of our dishes, too. (She had the loco moco.) As I was eating, I just felt like it wouldn't agree with me, so I didn't even finish. I love food, so this isn't something I do often.   Definitely a waste of a lunch in NoDa.",

You are missing out on the BEST meal of yo' life--True story! They don't make gems like this anymore.   Give it up to the man that is making this all happen, Adam. Now, Triple D hasn't made his way through this 'hood yet, but I'm sure that when the word gets out about Local Loaf, the lines will be out the door!   You see, Local Loaf was a small vendor located at the 7th Street Public Market. Once the word got out how phuckin' delicious this place was, they had to move up to bigger and better things! Now, located in a residential neighborhood, Local Loaf is offering more than just food. They now offer a cute lil' beer  and wine joint within their restaurant. Very exclusive if you ask me! Walkin' into the cute lil' restaurant, my friend and I were quickly greeted by Adam at the door. Now, I have to admit this man has a personality! I absolutely felt like family once I walked in. Adam went over the menu with us and left us to make our choice.   My friend and I were so fascinated by the menu that we wish we could have ordered EVERYTHING! Well, let's be real, I did fly and drive thousands of miles just to try Local Loaf! I had to go hard or go home--and that's exactly what we did. We ordered the famous chicken and egg biscuit followed by the Local Loaf Burger, which was phuckin' delicious!    I love how small the place is; I was able to see the handsome, Noah Robinson, the chief of Local Loaf, making my food the whole time. I didn't know what was sexier, watching my food being made or watching Noah.  All the food was flavorful and enjoyable--perfectly seasoned and matched well together! The burger was not too heavy and didn't leave us feeling heavy after the meal. We were able to split both of the dishes in two and we left full! I wish I could have purchased some of their tasty jams as well; don't forget to check those out!   The menu is bursting with creativity and will not disappoint! I am definitely coming back. This place is EVERYTHING!",

For breakfast I'm a fan of something simple like a bagel or pastry although their omlet did not disappoint. For lunch I haven't been let down but I was highly impressed with their BLT featuring fried green tomatoes (get the chips with it, the cucumber salad is for higher tastes).  Pro tip- while you wait shop around the market",

I needed something for breakfast on my way to work this morning and didn't want to do my typical pick up so I decided to hop off the light rail at the Market. There's only a few places open in the early mornings so I decided to try Local Loaf's Breakfast Burrito after looking at their menu online.  My food took about 10-15 minutes which didn't seem like too long. I ordered to go and they bagged it for me with silverware then called my number at the counter. After I walked to work, I enjoyed a still warm burrito. The tortilla was crunchy on the outside and warm on the inside. None of the flavors really dominate but together it's a great combination. Plus the cucumber salad is more like pickles and I don't think I've ever eaten so many cucumbers early in the morning - I'd highly recommend this as a side. I will definitely be back to explore their lunch menu and other breakfast options (I see you biscuits and gravy) in the future!",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place because I had sent my sister here before and I had never been able to go. She got a great sounding chicken breakfast sandwich so I needed to see what it was all about.   We walked around 7th street public market which was buzzing because it was Sunday and decided to order at Local Loaf. My husband and I ordered the Chicken and the Egg which was a beautifully fried piece of chicken breast, on a buttermilk biscuit, with aged white cheddar, a cheerwine sauce and a fried egg. It was really tasty - I could have done without the cheese as it was sort of congealed by the time it got to the table. We ordered a side of fruit to go with the sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised that it was blueberries, strawberries and grapes. Not your run of the mill cheaper fruit salad options.   My friends ordered the same sandwich and an order of the special of the day: tamales. They looked really good and they had grits on the side and said they were great!   The people working the registers were very friendly.   My real gripe which sort of tainted the whole experience ... we ordered on two separate tickets one after the other and our meals came out completely spaced.  So my husband and my sandwich came out first, then about 8 minutes later came the second sandwich and then about 10 minutes after that the tamales came. So almost 20 minutes after the first meal. The tamales and the second sandwich were on the same ticket so I'm confused as to why they were sent out at two totally radically different times.   Good was still good, but wish the delivery to the table was a little more refined.",

Local Loaf sounded good and we saw a few tables with their breakfast items, so we decided to give it a shot. I loved the place and would come here more often if I were close by.   So one: why did it take so long for our food to come out? It must've been around 30 minutes in total for our one sandwich to come out. Turns out, someone had gotten the order wrong or given us the wrong number. The staff was oddly combative with each other and was so obvious that their work culture is horrible.   Anyways, the sandwich was pretty good! I was half annoyed that I didn't know the breakfast sandwiches did not come with chips (I would have gotten something off the sandwich menu if I had known! For the same price). It felt like the price was $2-3 more than it should have been for the one sandwich.",

    "text": "Local Loaf recently opened at the 7th Street Public Market's in Uptown Charlotte, NC and we are already hooked.  Adam Spears is the creative mind behind Local Loaf and the vision is to provide the finest freshly baked artisan breads, world class ciabattas, handed rolled baguettes, and a variety of fresh baked loaves. We haven't come across anything like this in the Queen City yet and we were in love at the first bite.  The Local Dip comes served on a hand rolled baquette with red wine braised sirloin, provolone cheese, caramelized onions, and au jus. The best part of this sandwich was easily the baguette. As a baker I (ella) really admire people who will take the time to hand craft the bread they serve. The baguette was light and airy, had great flavor and didn't cut the roof of my mouth when I ate it. The sirloin was dripping with flavor that paired perfectly with the provolone and carmel onions, and the au jus was the perfect dip.  I (curtis) opted for the hot steak sandwich which is served on a crusty baquette with marinated skirt steak, red onion jam, melted aged white cheddar, cress mirco greens, and topped off with a horseradish garlic aioli. I hate horseradish... but the horseradish garlic aioli was what I would consider \"finger lickin' good\" and the skirt steak was as juicy as it was fresh. This was the best steak sandwich I've had in... well... maybe ever?  We loved Local Loaf so much on our first trip we decided to head back a few days later to check out the breakfast menu. Ella got the chicken & egg biscuit with a generous piece of fried chicken breast topped with a Cheerwine chipotle honey glaze, aged white cheddar, a soft poached egg, and mustard greens.  This is by far the best tasting and most creative breakfast sandwich I (ella) have ever come across. The chicken was super juicy with the perfect amount of fried crunchy exterior and the poached egg added a nice sauce to soak up into the light fluffy biscuit. The part that really stood out was the spicy, sweet, and very delicious Cheerwine chipotle honey glaze. One bite of the chicken and egg biscuit made be an instant fan.  The steak & egg baguette came with marinated steak served with soft scrambled egg, honey roasted garlic and smoked jalapeno aioli, arugula served on a rustic hand-rolled baguette. I (curtis) absolutely loved the sandwich but didn't like the focaccia it was served on. Normally its served on a \"rustic hand-rolled baquette\" but they weren't ready when we were there so mine came on focaccia instead. Ella makes an amazing focaccia that I have become slightly accustomed too so maybe I'm a little biased but whatever.  Local Loaf just opened in the 7th St Public Market and if you haven't been by there lately you really need too. Chef Adam has an amazing concept on his hands and we're in love with Local Loaf.",

They bake fresh bread daily, and it's really cool to be able to see the bakers working right there, but there have been occasions when the sandwiches have been made with really hard / chewy bread. They need more people at the register taking orders, to speed up the order taking & payment process. I couldn't guarantee you would have a splendid experience if you ate here; it's hit or miss. Perhaps with time the food quality will get consistent and the service will get better.",

The biscuit is large and dry usually so make sure you have your drink but don't let that scare you because the flavor of the drizzle, chicken, and egg give such a great flavor. They have soups of the day and if you see they have beer cheese broccoli, you better get it. It may be the best cheesy broccoli soup I have ever had. The only draw back to this place is they don't have drinks except for bottled or canned drinks which I wont pay for especially water, I dont let that stop me from coming.",

There was a queue which is always a good sign plus they had a veggie option for myself. I opted for the veggie falafel burger with chips and my husband went for the French toast with maple syrup. Overall, the service was great, the girl behind the desk was very helpful and my food was great. The chips are homemade and deliciously salty and crunchy, the burger was 4/5, it was tasty enough and the bread roll was delicious but it didn't taste much like falafel just like a bean burger tbh. My husband however was really disappointed, his French toast tasted and looked really bland, no sugar or cinnamon flavour and he left half of it on the plate. A real shame for a pricey brunch!!

Local Loaf has their bread in shops all across town and It's already made a good impression on me. Going to the market have me a chance to try one of their sandwiches as well.   I got the Cuban sandwich with house made chips. The Cuban was fresh and delicious. The meat was almost in a patty and crispy on the top and bottom from the grill. The sandwich wasn't too big that it left me feeling stuffed but was a good enough size to fill me up. The chips were really good as well, but would have been marginally better if they were on smaller pieces.   My wife also got the portobello sandwich and she really enjoyed it.   I can't wait to go back and get a breakfast sandwich. The photos look really good and you can get 15% off with Yelp check in.   They are opening a location in NoDa at some point in the future which will be much more convenient for me. Can't wait for that!",

    "text": "* GROUPON BUYERS PLEASE BE AWARE*  Recently I purchased a deal from Groupon. The deal is good for 6 take out box lunches at this place. However, I was not able to use the Groupon during my visit. The cashier told me that I can only redeem all at once, meaning that I have to get six sandwiches during one visit. I explained that this restriction was not specified on the Groupon deal page, and I asked if they could offer me a voucher for 6 visits instead. Unfortunately, they declined it and told me to either use it or lose it.  So apparently my first experience with them was quite upset. Before I purchased the deal, I tried calling them three times to specify the restrictions, however, no one answered the phone during their business hours that day (Saturday 3pm). So I just went ahead and purchased the Groupon.  I agree that it's possible that a misunderstanding could occur during a business. Nevertheless, when both parties realize that it's a misunderstanding due to some unclear clause provisions during the initial communication; at that point, if the seller decides not to honor it or issue a proper refund, then it becomes a scam. Unfortunately, this happened to me today. So I wanted to bring awareness to other potential buyers to this dishonest behavior.  NL",

And now the gravy... it was cold as an Eskimo's nipple in the winter without a shirt on.  Theres no way this was held to standards of temperature... hence the \"90\" sanitation rating score that is somewhat hidden.  They over peppered the gravy with an Italian seasoning reminiscent of how i would flavor an Italian sausage pizza... maybe they are on to something there, who knows.  I hate the places that have a \"tip\" line before you get any food or experience any service. Well have no fear millennials i am not like my peers, i confidently mark... no tip followed by \"have a nice day\". Then if i like the experience i hand them cash afterwards... this should be the norm  I also tasted the grits, taste bc i would not eat another bite...  The worst grits in charlotte- which also consisted of an up-charge. Literally gagged when i bit into the cold pile of shit that it was.  Good day mates! (as i finished writing this, just now, more pizza pepper just came unstuck from my teeth... eeewww)",

The burger I had was also really light for being meaty and bacon-y, thanks to all the greens and light fluffy bread. But despite the localness of it all, my burger wasn't my most memorable sandwich. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't check this place out.  The environment is chill and sitting outside is definitely a plus.  The staff was really attentive and super quick to bring out our food.   I wouldn't say local loaf is the most amazing, mind blowing place to get food, but it's definitely not at the bottom of the list either.  It's a great place for a light lunch with an environment that is easy to relax with friends or catch up on some work.",

I don't even like eggs like that but this bad boy is large and filled with sweet potatoes, black beans, and more.   My only gripe, the grits are no bueno, tasteless to say the least and I've tried them twice.   Otherwise great spot.  Tip: Park in the garage, bring your ticket and get it validated at one of the merchant, whoever has the stamp. You need to just buy something from the market and you'll earn 90 minute validation.

I got a Local Dip sandwich with a side of chicken noodle soup and it was nice to have the option of soup as a side on a chilly day.  First off, any of their sandwiches will get a big head start because of the quality of the bread they are served on.  The Dip was on a baguette which was a perfect blend of crispy and chewy and was toasted in some garlic butter.  The meat on the sandwich is pot roast braised in a red wine sauce.  Caramelized onions are added and some local cheese is melted on top.  The sandwich is served with some yummy jus for dipping.  The only downer on this visit was that the very first bite was a big hunk of fat which had me deconstruct the sandwich to eat with some more inspection involved.  That was the only sandwich misstep however as the flavors were very good and hearty.  The side of soup was OK but not outstanding as it tended to have an onion flavor that overwhelmed the chicken.  It did take the chill off the day though so I gobbled it up!  After ordering at the counter and being given a number, the food came out quickly which is a real plus during lunch.",

When I asked them for mayo, they said they didn't have any which broke my heart because I LOVE mayo on my burgers. My husband got the breakfast burrito. It was stuffed with egg, cheese, corn, black beans, and sweet potatoes. It was yummy but dry. I had hoped for a sauce maybe inside it or a salsa? My friend got the chicken biscuit with an egg on top and it was divine! They serve your meal on a wooden cutting board which is a cute touch. I did wish that they had more condiments available.",

The chalkboard menu boasts a variety of breakfast and lunch options with daily specials peppered in.    Wanna build your own omelet?  They've got you covered with a bountiful list of potential ingredients.  Fluffy pancakes more your fancy?  They do that too!  Brioche french toast?  Yea, baby!  Eggs with bacon and toast?  Over easy?  Over medium?  Over hard?  Sunny side up?  Yes, yes, yes, and yes!  Can you tell I've frequented this place more for breakfast?  Though I can assure you, the lunch options are equally enticing.   The staff is quite friendly, and most now know me by name.  Adam, the founder, is always busy in the kitchen.  He works hard to keep the menu fresh, making periodic changes.  When you go, you'll place your order at the counter and you'll then be provided with a number to place at your table, or wherever you chose to sit throughout the market.  The ingredients used to prepare your entrees are fresh and local, and you can taste it with every bite.  If you like what you taste, chances are it's available for purchase right there in the market.  So what are you waiting for?  If your answer isn't breakfast, go get your loaf on!",

It came out super fast and the presentation was very instagrammable. The egg is cooked perfectly and the yolk sinks into the biscuit when you cut into it and it was great. The chicken is crispy on the inside but tender on the inside and the melted cheese on top made it even better. The chipotle cheer wine sauce and the honey sauce gave it a sweet/salty dynamic. The only downside is that the biscuit was a bit hard and the dish was hard to eat in general without having stuff fall all over the plate (board?) I ordered the cucumber salad on the side because I was trying to be healthy and it's not normally something I really enjoy eating but this tasted like fresh pickles but less pickle-y and more tangy - I highly recommend it. It's also a giant portion for how much you're paying.",
