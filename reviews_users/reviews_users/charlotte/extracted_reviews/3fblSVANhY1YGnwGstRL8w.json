    "text": "The wifi's still free but they changed my beloved Mocha!  Now you have to pick white chocolate, dark chocolate or milk chocolate.  And they got really snarky when I asked which one tastes like the original.    So I tried the milk chocolate and it just doesn't taste the same at all.  The dark chocolate is the closest and really doesn't taste like dark chocolate which is good for me and my coffee preferences.  But isn't it False advertising if it doesn't taste \"dark\"?  Especially for a non-dairy person, why'd you have to go and mess with the program just before Christmas?  My final complaint is they close at 5pm on Sundays which is really annoying.  They're always kicking about 10 people out and people are still trying to come in and they alway ask \"Are they closed already?\"",

They cut something out of the wall several months ago & they STILL haven't cleaned up the dust from it or filled in whatever it was they cut out.  It shares space with Bruegger's which is nice.  Usually Bruegger's is just as messy with crap on the floor, on the chair seats on the table tops, on the counters (Caribou, too).  It seems Bruegger's has done some housekeeping or refurbishing recently, but really it's just a germy mess.  p.s.  if you're going to this Caribou, please practice your parallel parking skills first (ladies!!! stop giving us a bad name!).  Also, when you're walking up to it, if you see someone parking, please don't walk in front of or behind someone trying to park their car.  People do this all the time & it amazes me that people aren't getting hit.  I guess the people parking are paying more attention than the one's walking.",

However, I am upgrading this joint to four stars due to the excellent service they gave me today!  It has been very icy here in Charlotte, and my ceramic travel mug was quite cold this morning.  The barista noticed and offered to heat it up with hot water before filling it!  Very thoughtful of her.",

I do like the quiet atmosphere, it is a great place to come after a long day and just surf the internet or read a novel.    The great thing about this particular location is that it is shared by a Bruegger's Bagels, so it is a nice place to get started for the day as well.  People have business meetings here, I saw a few college-types busting out the books, and a few caffeine freaks as well.    The dimly lit room's peaceful setting erupted however when I heard two men having a business transaction near my booth.  A Caucasian gentlemen complimented his Asian business partner on his handshake.  \"Nice handshake\", he said.  \"Not many orientals have strong handshakes.\"  What a rash generalization.  I wanted to reach out and slap the man.    Besides this, I liked the spot.  Would somebody turn off the Lenny Kravitz!",

They have a huge sitting area with free wifi. Caribou has been my 2nd \"office\" for some time now. This location has the best customer service, atmosphere and management team in the entire city of Charlotte. I can't speak highly enough about the manager Todd who runs this Caribou, and fully understands what it takes to engage with customers. You don't find places like this very often so when you do you know to appreciate it.",

    "text": "I was devastated to learn my local Caribou Coffee was closing down, as the franchise was bought out by a group of suits and is being closed to make room for something else. Caribou personally holds a lot of great memories for me with my friends and girlfriend. That's why, after mine closed, I had to trek down one of the three remaining stores in the Charlotte/Lake Norman area... Almost 30 miles away.  If you don't care about all that and want to know what makes it great, their coffees are excellent (I quite enjoy their blended frozen coffees) and the employees are so friendly. This one isn't as cozy and relaxed as mine in Mooresville was, but there are plenty of open spaces to work/lounge and free Wi-Fi. Plus it's got a feel to it that makes it, just... Special.  I can't stand Starbucks honestly, so Caribou is one of those rare gems that stands out among the dozens of soulless green-and-white logo coffee shops all over the place. Caribou has not only great coffee, it's got personality. It's a shame those are usually the first to go in this dog-eat-dog capitalist society.  Here's to you, Caribou Coffee. I raise my blended turtle mocha in your honor. Thanks for everything. And as long as there is one Caribou Coffee standing, I'll keep coming back.",

The place is very clean an well maintained with very friendly and efficient staff, who clearly love doing what they do. There's a charm to the place which is reminiscent of independent coffee shops, but falls a little bit short of achieving it. There's a daily trivia question above the counter which if you answer correctly, you get a dime off your order, and the staff address you as an actual person as opposed to a customer; but there's something about the place which makes it feel like an experience manicured to feel like an independent coffee shop.  Nevertheless, there's a good selection of coffee available for purchase, along with seasonal specials. Around Christmas time I tried the eggnog latte (or the 'Fa-la-latte' as they called it, and as I called it forgoing a shred of my masculinity in the process). I usually have a milk chocolate mocha, which strikes a nice balance between the sweetness of the chocolate and the bitterness of the coffee, not veering too much towards either side. They also include a chocolate covered coffee bean with it, which is a nice touch.  There's a nice, if somewhat limited selection of foods, but this is understandable since there's a Bruegger's bagels literally opposite the counter. The sweets that Caribou do are great, not too rich, but a nice treat to go alongside your drink.  One of my few qualms about the place would probably be the prices. A small mocha is just shy of $4, which is pretty pricey for what you get (the coffee is nice, but not THAT nice).  Overall, a nice place to kill an hour or two with a friend of partner. The atmosphere is pleasant, and the background music is usually pretty good (no cheesy chart music and no Starbucks middle of the road Norah Jones inspired boring melodies).",

The new manager is not nearly as friendly and every time she makes my cappuccino it tastes burned...might as well go to Starbucks for that taste. And I always receive less than half. I pay for a medium but get a small. Any other place I've gone to gives me the full medium amount- I don't get it. I'd have to say I'll be checking out more local brews from now on. And FYI- if you want good cappuccino or espresso try Rush Espresso.",

But you ladies worked with me as I put the phone on mute several times to place my order LOL! You smiled and did not become frustrated with me. I truly thank you both so very much and hope that you continue carrying that joy and positivity through your store location.  Especially when you have customers such as myself that comes in on the phone {again so sorry lol}.   Thank you ladies you were amazing!",

The service is always great and the location is very warm, with several tables to work, gather with friends and relax.  In addition, this location is shared jointly with Bruegger's Bagels, a definite plus. Caribou has great breakfast/snack items, but having the bagel option right next to you is great, since Caribou doesn't serve bagels. One thing that I has always disappointed me.  Next time your in Park Road Shopping Center stop by and enjoy a morning coffee or afternoon pick me up!",

I love it iced or hot! The hot version taste almost like a hot chocolate with expresso shots.  Staff is super nice at this location, the ONLY complaint is there are certain bartistas that make the drinks perfectly and I only encounter 2 bartistas that didn't meet up to par but I figured maybe they're new. I'm pretty sure they would make my drink over again but I just never stick around long enough to try my coffee before I leave.",

Could be because of the joint venture/shared space with Brugger's bagels.  There's a large common dining space with tables/chairs/ booths... a good use of space since you got Caribou on the right side and bagel place on the left.  The space still has the injection of Caribou quirk in it.. warm woods... unique decor... I have  yet to see a cute stuffed animal head mounted on the wall here, but they could just be me missing it somewhere.  Staff are super friendly and they keep \"their side\" nice and tidy... well really the whole space is pretty clean.  I haven't stuck around too long, but I assume they offer wifi since I see a ton of people with laptops doing the \"coffeehouse thing.\"  Plenty of parking in Park Rd shopping center.... just be careful since it can get pretty busy with people running their errands and going to and from.",

I have Been spending a lot more time at Starbucks because of losing my beloved Caribou- so today I got the chance to compare Caribou white chocolate pumpkin to Starbucks pumpkin latte!
