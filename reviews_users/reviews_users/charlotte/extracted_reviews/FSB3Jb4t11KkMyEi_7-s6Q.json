I always get fantastic service when I come here, and the food is always delicious!  I've tried their chips and salsa and queso, their fried pickles, and their onion rings which were all delicious.  Their fried pickles might be the best I've ever had!  Their hushpuppies that they give you (for free) are phenomenal!  I always get the BBQ sandwich with Mac and cheese and it's great!  They have an assortment of BBQ sauces that are all really good.  I recommend mixing the vinegar base, the tomato base, and the Carolina one together and it makes an awesome flavor!  The sex on the patio drink is also REALLY good and I'm not even a huge fan of pineapple but it has such a great flavor! I highly recommend coming here!",

    "text": "When I think about Carolina bbq, Mac's Speed Shop immediately pops into my head.  Although I've dined at less than a handful of bbq joints in Charlotte, Mac's is ranked #1 for me.  Shortly after being seated, warm hush puppies with a side of whipped butter are brought to your table.  These puppies have a crunchy outside and a soft center and seem to melt in your mouth.  Good luck only eating a few! My go-to pick on the menu is always the Hickory Smoked & Pulled Pork BBQ, which comes with two sides- I choose the salad and the mac & cheese.  I love that they ask if you want all of the fixings on your salad.  The mac & cheese is like a taste of heaven....cheesy, gooey and creamy elbow macaroni with a crispy top.  I salivate just thinking about it.  The pork is dry rubbed and hickory wood smoked for 12 hrs and is so tender and flavorful.  There is various sauces on the table for you to adorn your meat with, ranging from Carolina vinegar based to a much sweeter version (what I prefer).  I am eager to give other dishes a try, although it will be difficult to stray from my norm!",

Surprisingly good black bean burger (yeah I did get that here once) and yummy twists on classics like a Cuban and Brisket Philly Wrap. Give it a try!",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Charlotte and to a BBQ joint whose team has competed and won on the BBQ trail. Mac's Speed Shop offers a wide range of food including wings, salads, mexicue, and, of course, BBQ.  Dora here. Anyone else curious as to how they came up with that name? Just wondering. lol. We were among the few to brave high 90 degree temps to enjoy their spacious outdoor patio, which really was quite nice. Most everyone opted for a/c and chose to eat inside.:) Even so, service was fast and efficient, and the server helpful with suggestions.  The Onion Rings Basket appetizer came with a spicy horseradish dipping sauce. These rings were great-dredged in what appeared to be corn meal?- crunchy on the outside and tender enough to bite through. The dipping sauce complimented nicely, although a bit spicy. Dora here. A bit spicy? That cayenne and horseradish kicked big time, but soooo good! Yowza! Make sure you ask for extra napkins to wipe your forehead. Fair warning.  For our meal, we chose to share the Little Bit of Stuff, a combo platter which included our choice of St. Louis ribs, Texas beef sausage, beef brisket, and smoked turkey with sides of mac n cheese and cream corn.  The ribs were great, competition grade, smoky, and cooked perfectly, moist and not fatty. The sausage was equally good, not spicy at all, but with a hardy beef flavor.  Dora here. Wow, I'm glad we ordered the little platter. Even sharing, we still brought home leftovers. For some reason, I expected the turkey to be sliced, so I was surprised when it came out pulled. A tad dry for my liking, probably because I can't help but compare it to my favorite holiday meal, fried turkey. Still, it was tender and will make awesome sandwiches later. The brisket was chewy with just a hint of sweet at the end. Yum! This was some of my favorite BBQ besides hubby's. They score big points for great sides, too. The mac n cheese was firm, not moist like some cheesy pastas, just the way I like it, and those kernels of corn snapped with freshness. Mac's Speed Shop definitely gets added to our \"must go back\" list. Maybe then we'll find out how they got their name. lol.  ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

    "text": "Meal: Dinner, eat in  All Ratings out of 10:  Quality of food: 8 Food to Spend Value: 8 Quality of Service: 8 Overall Rating: 8  Whenever I visit the Carolinas (which is where I grew up), I am always seeking out Carolina BBQ since I can't get that in the Pacific NW. I had flown into Charlotte with the family to visit inlaws, and we were in the mood for something good for dinner. I of course wanted BBQ, and after doing some searching landed on Mac's Speed Shop. It looked like an interesting place so we decided to check it out. We were a bit hesitant at first arrival given that the restaurant has a really interesting biker bar theme to it. The hostess assured me that the restaurant was family friendly, complete with kids menus, so we decided to dine in.  Besides the biker bar theme throughout, the most noticeable thing was the delicious BBQ smells attacking my olfactory senses. Everything I saw being delivered to tables looked amazing, and we couldn't wait to order our food. We started with an order of fried pickles, the perfect appetizer when in the south. The pickles were served as chips, had a nice crispy batter with a great flavor, and the dipping sauce was perfect. The basket we ordered didn't last long.  There are quite a few BBQ options, including beef or pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and turkey, as well as southern style catfish and shrimp. They also serve burgers and a variety of sandwiches. One of the options is a combo platter where you get to choose 4 meats, and you get can order \"A Little Bit of Stuff\" or a \"A Whole Lot of Stuff\", the difference being $10 and a lot more meat in the second option. This sounded like a good option for 2 adults to share, and after some deliberation we chose brisket, pulled pork, pulled turkey, and pork ribs. We also got to choose 4 sides and went with BBQ beans, mac and cheese, collard greens, and green bean casserole. Everything was delicious. The meats were all very tender, with nice smoke rings and a smoky flavor. I was especially a big fan of the brisket and ribs, though the pork and turkey were quite good as well. All 4 sides were also very well done, though the mac and cheese and collards were definitely the favorites.   The kids meals were a good size and enjoyed by all. My son ordered a BBQ chicken sammie with a side of mac and cheese, and it was also quite good. The kids were catered to quite a bit actually and really enjoyed the experience.   We really didn't have room for dessert, but southern style banana pudding is just too hard for me to pass up. We also ordered a brownie ala mode which was shared by multiple people. I didn't personally try the brownie (though it got thumbs up from everyone who did), but the banana pudding was amazing. It was definitely True Southern style, with a rich creamy pudding completed by the crunchy texture of the Nilla wafers. It was a perfect ending to the meal, and we were quite full!  There is quite a bit of seating throughout the restaurant, which is good considering how crowded it gets. Despite the large bar and overall biker bar atmosphere, there were a large number of families there. The restaurant was definitely noisy but had a fun atmosphere. Our waitress was great and provided amazing service, including making doubly sure that the kids were enjoying themselves. The prices were very good, especially considering both the quantity and quality. I definitely plan on visiting again in the future when I am back in Charlotte.",

Knowing that Charlotte isn't know so much for it's bbq, we focused on finding something with a lot of other options as well. We ordered fried pickles, cracklin's, burnt ends and a small pulled pork platter (with onion rings and Texas toast). The best part of the meal was that everything came with a different dipping sauce and we just dipped every different item in every different sauce and it was amazing. The only thing we could do without was the Texas toast (which really was just toast- not sure if it's different in NC compared to the Texas toast I've had other places). Otherwise the service was quick, the food was good and the atmosphere was super laidback- exactly what we wanted after a day of perusing some of Charlotte's awesome breweries (see other posts for beer recommendations around the city!). Side note: I highly recommend using the Bird motorized scooters to travel around town if the weather is nice. We rented them and drove (or scootered??) down to Mac's from Bland St and it was a fun, new way to get to dinner!",

She told us all about her favorite dishes, convinced me to get the Lil Bit Combo. She also convinced my buddy to allow her to make his order choice a surprise for me and she hit that spot on. If there was ever a chick who should work at a biker bar, she is it. Her beer knowledge was top shelf, she even knew where the breweries were located off the top of her head. Convinced us to get her favorites and did not disappoint. Honestly this review is really just, go to Mac's, ask for the young lady with a dark sleeve, dark hair (Mari) & let her order for u along with a beer pairing. You don't need a menu with this one. Mac's amazing hire here!!!!! Coming back just for her. Applause all around. Just killin it in the customer service game.",

Firstly, they've started serving bottomless trays of hot hushpuppies and butter. Talk about dangerous! And they are really good hushpuppies that are bite-sized and not too greasy. Secondly, the beer list is extensive, so every your pickiest friend will find something they like.  Food-wise, my recommendations for vegetarians/pescatarians include:  Baja Salad - great flavors, texture, and big serving Crispy Shrimp Tacos - great flavor and presentation Black Bean Quesadillas - a little more complex than your standard quesadilla. Side Car Combo (3 or 4 sides of your choice) always with Mac 'n Cheese, Green Bean Casserole.",

The complimentary hush puppies were the best thing on our table and with the bacon butter it was amazing! The restaurant is big and there's plenty of parking. The majority of people sit outside,but there's indoor seating for those of us that like A/C. The servers were friendly as well.   Ok, that's about it for the good. The dry rub wings were horrible and saturated in dry rub making them essentially inedible! Their St. Louis Style Ribs weren't tender at all and the Mac & Cheese sucked! As did the poor excuse for Texas Toast. Oh! I almost forgot! The fries were actually very good!   We usually skip dessert when the food sucks, so we asked for the check and hit the road. If you've never been, don't bother! It's all HYPE.",

The onion rings we started with were big and the breading was thick and crispy. They came out fast. We put in our order and began to enjoy the onion rings. A couple of minutes later a complimentary basket of hushpuppies was delivered with the best homemade honey butter I have ever tasted.    Our food arrived as we were finishing the onion rings. I got the beef rib which was huge. It was absolutely the best beef rib I have ever eaten. The mac and cheese was good and the collard greens were excellent. My wife got the chicken sandwich and was very happy with it. She is big on chicken and this exceeded her expectations.   I have gotten the small combo plate many times in the past. You get a choice of 4 meats from a list of 5. The small combo is gigantic. Two people could actually eat this and be satisfied. The large comes with 2 additional sides and would simply be a feast.  The fried pickles are my favorite of any place in Charlotte or anywhere for that matter. I didn't get them last night because we had the onion rings, and I knew the amont of food to come would be more than we could finish. Our server gladly brought us take home containers.  While we dined, not only did our server check on us several times, two members of management came by to make sure everything was ok. Awesome service. Mac's was packed but the food came fast and it was very good. I will keep going back for more. If you like good BBQ, you owe it to yourself to try this place out. You will be glad you did, just go hungry!",

Don't think that the small plate isn't enough to fill you up -- it's a good size, and the reason I'd pay the $2 extra for their large plate is because the food is so damn good.  I'm a huge fan of the BBQ Pork plate.  Delicious, smoked, tender barbecue pork that comes with two \"Side Cars\".  I've had their Mac and Cheese, French Fries, Cole Slaw, and Brunswick Stew -- all fantastic options.  In addition to the two sides, it also comes with a slice of Texas Toast as well.  Really good sauces at the table as well.  I really like the ambiance of this place too.  You can sit inside in a bar area (looks a bit cramped, but I haven't sat there yet), or outside at some of the wooden tables.  We had a lot of people with us, so it was just easier that way.  They really do a great job with this punk-and-motorcycles theme, and it's cool to see.  The service has been pretty good too the times we've all been.  Overall, a rad place to get your NC BBQ fix.  I dig it a lot.",

This place had more polish than I like in my BBQ joints, but they made up for it with great service, good food and a fun atmosphere.  The pulled pork was moist and smoky, with the right amount of sauce added to allow me to add more if I so desired. A nice selection of sauces were at the table for my use in concocting up a mixture of sauces to my taste. The sides were tasty - my collards were cooked right, and my slaw was cool and creamy. The hush puppies were delicious, but probably overkill with this meal.  Still....I should have ordered the ribs.  I just wasn't that hungry though, having been travelling on business. We also arrived at Mac's pretty late so I didn't want to sleep on a full BBQ belly later.  Mac's has a bit of a biker bar vibe.  The staff has more ink in them than the Staples pen aisle. It was like being served BBQ by living murals.  But the Southern charm won out and our server was delightful and fun.  I would definitely be back to try the ribs. I sampled the brisket and it was very good.  The Count eats BBQ across the world in his many travels through exotic lands. The South is the BBQ capital of the world and North Carolina has its own style - which is excellent!  Give Mac's a try. It is enjoyable and the BBQ is quite representative of the NC style.",

They have live music often and tons of beer selection. The only reason I have given a 4 star and not a 5 is because my girlfriend has tried to get a specific beer they have on the menu but it is always out. If it is that popular than they should stock more. just saying. other than that I love this place and do not plan to stop going anytime soon.",

The pulled pork, aside from being cold, was decent, and they had a variety of tasty sauces. However, for a place named \"Mac's\", their mac and cheese was so disappointing. Actually the worst I've ever had. Save for the small patch of shredded cheese on top, I thought they forgot to add cheese to this batch. It was just like eating lukewarm, watery, overcooked noodles. I don't recommend it to anyone. But overall servers were nice and attentive, and it was still crowded before dinner hours, so maybe that's how North Carolinians like their BBQ and mac.

Second try on wings and they were cold too and my side of onion rings became a ring and a half.  Third try and still cold.   They have serious kitchen issues.   The manager tried to make it right and they were extremely nice and comp'd the wings, the 2 plates we sent back and took half off the others.  He did try and I'll give them credit for that.

It's a great local place to grab some beers after work as well.  Sometimes they give you hush puppies as a complementary appetizer. I always walk in expecting them but only get them 50% of the time.  They have a GREAT outdoor area with live music on weekends.",

The bartenders are great. Very attentive and they know the menu. One was happy to give me suggestions. I started with The Chopper with balsamic. Fresh and tasty and plentiful. The kitchen was pumping out food to a slam-packed place just before the UNC vs Duke game. I took the recommendation and had the brisket with mac n cheese and green bean casserole. The brisket was just fatty enough and the sides were outstanding. Would have loved to have dessert but I was stuffed. Check this place out. Great!",

We like to bring our dog and sit on the patio, but if your pup is distracted by loud noises and traffic maybe this isn't the spot for them.  The wait staff is always very attentive and knowledgeable, and it seems like turnover is very low as we have had the same waitress several times. The food is really good, although my brisket has been dry on one occasion. We love the hushpuppies and nachos and burnt ends. So delicious. My husband has decided he'll only order the half barbecue chicken because he likes it so much.  My one complaint would be that the music is very loud. I know the atmosphere is modeled after a biker bar, but maybe turn it down a little so I'm not yelling at my friends across the table.",

    "text": "As a New Yorker visiting Charlotte for the first time, I was very much looking forward to getting some BBQ. We viewed the menu online and being only 5 minutes away from where we were staying, it seemed like a great idea.   The wait was pretty long, about 30 minutes. We sat at the bar and enjoyed some beer in the meantime. They have a really large and great selection so the wait wasn't too brutal.   When we finally sat down we were welcomed with some hush puppies, which on my first experience was pretty great :) though I have nothing to compare it to.   Our appetizer was the burnt ends (brisket) and I couldn't be any happier. It was delicious! It was smiley and had just the right amount of heat. I could've easily eaten a whole plate of these to myself.   The entrees we ordered was the ribs (me), pulled pork, and beer can chicken. I got to sample everything which was yummy, but boy oh boy was I in heaven with my 1/2 rack of ribs. Just thinking about it now makes my mouth water. You can't find BBQ like this back in NY. I'm very happy we visited this spot. We'll be back!! My mac n cheese was great, but the grits were pretty funny for my taste, though the flavor way pretty good.   As far as the food is concerned I'll give it 5 stars. It loses one star for the delayed service. We showed up at 8:20 and we're out by 10:30, which was the only downside. The staff was kind however! Maybe I'll need to stop by at a less busy time.",

    "text": "Who is writing the other reviews of Mac's???  Paid shills??? Make no mistake, this place does NOT make good barbecue.  I haven't tried the other entrees, but I tried the \"burnt ends\" appetizer and the beef brisket barbecue sandwich (I chose \"fatty\" instead of \"lean\" when the server asked). Both were foul abominations of real barbecue. As anyone who knows barbecue will tell you: \"burnt ends are the fatty, charcoaled ends of the brisket that are cut away before slicing the meat onto the plate.\"  What you get at Mac's are precisely-square shaped cuts of the main brisket (not the ends), thrown onto a grill and re-cooked to death in some weird sauce.  There is virtually no fat because they are made from the main brisket, not the fatty ends.  They are made into sort of artificial \"burnt ends\" by re-cooking the already-cooked brisket on a grill and are just awful.  For someone who loves and savors the fatty, smoked and delightfully-charcoaled tips of the brisket, these were an appalling clone of the real thing. And then, the \"beef brisket sandwich.\"  Urkkk.  2 slices (yes, you read that right, _2_ slices!) of brisket, drowning in sauce, laid to rest across 2 fat pieces of untoasted Texas toast.  Now as any elementary school kid can tell you, dumping anything wet onto white bread makes the whole piece of bread a soggy mess.  Guess the cooks at Mac's never heard of this principle because the sandwich was already soggy and disintegrating when it got to my table.  So, not so much a sandwich as an interment-on-a-plate. The 2 slices of brisket were probably OK, but I couldn't tell because the sauce they were drowned in effectively masked any taste at all.  All you could taste... was sauce. As the final insult, the prices charged were expensive.  I don't mind expensive if the meal is good, but expensive for a bad meal? No, NO, NO!!!!! I ordered their \"Hard Lemonade\" to drink. Laughable.  A glass-half-full tumbler of ice with a hint of hard lemonade in the bottom.  I should have just smuggled a Mike's hard lemonade in with me.  This gouging was the last straw. Just don't go here.",

Service it's self was just okay, it could have been better in regards to offering to buy the sauce and just paying more attention to see how we liked everything.

The wings are probably in the top 4 wings I've ever had. Their Carolina Wing sauce is to die for. They are grilled wings too, which taste amazing.   They bring you complimentary hushpuppies with dinner, which taste like a buttery breaded heaven, and they are served with this bacon honey butter - it doesn't get much better than that.   I'm a HUGE nachos girl...have probably tried them at every restaurant that serves them in Charlotte. Aside from Midwood Smokehouse, these are the best!   Surprisingly, their salads are AWESOME. They come packed with tasty toppings, and are served in a huge bowl. There are definitely options for the healthy eater when you don't feel like splurging.   Their drinks are reasonably priced & their atmosphere is pretty good. My only negative is the headbanging music they like to play. Would be such a better atmosphere if they picked some better music, but i guess they are trying to fit the \"biker vibe.\"",

I ordered a chicken wrap and looked through their beer menu. While they still have an extensive list of beers, they also have those beers that craft beer nerds would consider undesirable and shouldn't be listed as \"craft\" beer. But on this day, most of the local beers were on special. So that was a plus.  The chicken wrap took forever to arrive which I didn't understand since they weren't busy and Mac's service is usually fast. And then when I tasted it, the chicken was dry and flavorless. I had to add hot sauce to give it flavor and even that wasn't enough.  I thought maybe my experience at their other location was a once and done thing but apparently Mac's has gone downhill in the chain which often happens when a place expands.   But apparently some people like dry flavorless food in a biker bar atmosphere in a trendy neighborhood.",

I sampled a piece of smoked sausage from my friends plate and it was just as good.  The brisket had some fat and was juicy as well.  Amazing.   We finished up dinner by splitting a banana pudding.  It was served in a frosty mug.  Wonderful finish to any meal.   We will definetly come back here again.  Great view and atmosphere.",

The servers are almost always tatted-up and always super-attentive.    When the weather is nice, you can sit outside on their patio and enjoy fresh air along with bbq and beer.  When it's cooler, half of the outdoor patio can be closed in and they'll pack you in to the interior.    The food - you can't go wrong here.  If you're extra-hungry or sharing with someone, grab the \"little bit of everything\" - you get a selection of smoked meats and sides.  I also really like their quesadillas and chopped salad.  For an appetizer, grab the fried pickles - you won't be disappointed.  Their banana pudding will convert even non-pudding fans into fanatics!",

Today's special was a chimichanga which was amazing. It was smothered in cheesy goodness. I have no idea why it's not on the menu all the time. I ate it in typical Sam fashion queso in hair while making mmm noises. I have never been so pleased by BBQ before in my life. I'm still drooling post meal and I am not ashamed.

    "text": "I've been living in the South for about 6 years, and there's one thing I learned about being here...everyone has an opinion on the best BBQ.  Mac's Speed Shop can be summed up in one simple phrase:  Great BBQ with an edgy, casual vibe.  This is one of the few BBQ places I've been to where they have something for everyone:  1. The Outdoorsie - picnic style tables out front 2. The Dare Devil - super HOT wings that will burn your mouth off.  Just eat it all in one bite...I dare you. 3. The Healthy Eater - Great variety of salads with a ton of veggies where you can add a protein. 4. The Not-in-the-mood friend - for that one person who came to a BBQ place because all their friends wanted to go, they have Quesadillas, Turkey Sandwiches, burgers, etc. 5. The BBQ Connoisseur - you know this person is going straight for the ribs...and what a wise, delicious, tender, tasty choice that is.  Service can sometimes be a little slow, but I don't mind because I always go there to hang out.  There are a ton of tables pretty close together, so you'll want to go to Mac's if you want to be around a fun group of people in your flip flops and shorts while enjoying a great, casual meal.  Oh, and bring your appetite.  Now that I'm done with this review, my mouth is watering.",

We ordered the brisket and egg brunch and a burger.  The brisket and eggs was served in what looked like a flying saucer of a taco shell. The brisket, burnt. The flying sauced, inedible. The burger, I've had better at Five Guys. All things considered, a regrettable experience.",

The pork was tender and tasted great with their sauces (we had to buy one of the sauces).  The small platter had so much pork I almost couldn't finish it.  My husband had a combo with chicken, pork, brisket and ribs, collard greens and french fries so we could sample more.  He couldn't finish his plate but really wanted to.  My only critique are the bar stool chairs, I wanted to sit back and relax but you can't, it became a bit uncomfortable after a while with the hard seat and no back.",

I've been frequenting Macs Southend and Steele Creek (equidistance from my home in opposite directions) for many, many years and this one has never even remotely disappointed.  On this visit, my buddy and I stopped for a quick bite before hitting Exit Strategy. We arrived, we were quickly seated, and our server arrived nearly immediately after the hostess led us to our table. She knew her specials well and we ordered our drinks. Our food also came quickly and piping hot.  In my opinion, they have some of the best wings in town. They are smoked and sauced. They are also nice and plump wings with tons of meat. The smoking process gives them a delicious added layer of flavor. I only wish they'd step up their Bleu Cheese game, which is pretty weak for such a good wing.  The atmosphere is great. Exactly what you would expect from this type of BBQ joint. Again, in all the years I've been coming here, I've never had the slightest complaint.",

I've been here multiple times and their food really is good, but has a tendency to just sit in your tummy. Hubs and I always feel a little sick after eating here. But, their BBQ and mac n cheese is really tasty.   There's plenty of parking and indoor and outdoor seating with a pet friendly patio. They have live music outside often which is good and bad. I love the music and support local musicians, but it's usually too loud to have a conversation over and definitely too loud for dogs' ears. Our service has been hit or miss, sometimes awesome, sometimes neglected. And when there's a group of bikers around, be prepared for a wait and loud engines!  Mac's is a place where I'll go if invited by friends, but I wouldn't choose on my own. I also know a waitress that works here and they treat their employees pretty well, so I salute that.

I got the fish and shrimp tacos....my preference was the shrimp and I would suggest getting a side of the sauce that comes with it. My husband loved pulled pork and brisket tacos. Needless to say definitely check them out the next time you want tacos and enjoy a good beer special too.",

    "text": "If you're craving BBQ in Charlotte, then you gotta come here!! You get served a basket of hush puppies with the best dip in the world-- bacon maple honey butter. It was sooo mouth watering and I wish that I could buy a whole jar of it so I can spread it on everything!   We then ordered the combo platter to share. You get to choose 4 meats and 2 sides. We picked the St Louis ribs, pulled pork, beer can chicken and braised beef. For sides, we picked the Brunswick stew and green bean casserole. The St Louis ribs were great--equally as delicious as the ones at Midwood! The pulled pork is one of their most popular dishes and is a must-try! Both the green bean casserole had the perfect amount of crispiness and the Brunswick stew was a beef stew with an explosion of flavors.  All in all, I liked Mac's Speed Shop a tad bit more than Midwood Smokehouse because it was more reasonable in price and it came with a free side of hush puppies + amazing dip! If you only have time to try one place for BBQ in Charlotte, then I high recommend Mac's Speed Shop!!",

    "text": "My friends and I came here on a Sunday Evening, after being turned away from Sauceman's. We had heard good things about this place and were interested to try it for ourselves. We were seated immediately upon arrival by a friendly hostess. Within no time, our waitress came around and took our drink orders. We ordered a mix of water and some alcoholic beverages. On Sundays, they have discounted bloody marys and mimosas. Both of my friends that got them said that they were just lackluster. The mimosa was said to have tasted like \"Sunny D and champagne\" and the Bloody Mary never even came close to being finished.   After some time with the menu, we ordered our meals. Brisket, a burger, the sampler and the pulled pork. In terms of sides as a table, we ordered fries, chili, mac & cheese, green bean casserole, baked beans and the side salad. We also ordered a side of the Texas beef sausage.   After a short time, our food came out. Sadly enough we discovered that none of us were truly impressed with the meal. I got the sampler. All of the meats tasted like they were bathed in liquid smoke. Artificially smoky rather than truly smoked.  I asked for fatty brisket and had regular \"mixed\" brisket on my plate. When I pointed out was brought in additional piece of mixed brisket. I just gave up on the brisket.   The pulled pork was just okay. It definitely needed some sauce and had no natural seasoning of its own. The ribs were fall off the bone but again a little bit too much smoke. I took to using the mediocre table barbecue sauces to try to drown the artificial flavor. The beer can chicken had good flavor but again a bit too much liquid smoke.   In terms of sides, I only tasted the macaroni and cheese, baked beans, green bean casserole and side salad. I was not impressed with any of them. People rave about their mac & cheese and hush puppies and I found that neither was particularly impressive. Everything tasted like it had been sitting out for some time and was not up to temperature. The noodles in the mac & cheese were way overcooked, the green bean casserole needed seasoning, the baked beans tasted canned and the side salad was all iceberg lettuce, the honey mustard dressing was very good. For dessert we decided to split the apple bread pudding. It too was barely warm and didn't really taste like much. The loads of ice cream, caramel sauce and whipped cream made up for what it lacked on its own.   All in all, a pretty disappointing experience. Especially for so many locations and for so many people to have raved about.  I prefer Sauceman's food in general but was just disappointed by their customer service tonight.",

Also ordered a 16 piece chicken wings the dry rub and Carolina flavor. Those also weren't the best in my opinion. The best thing that we ate was the hush puppies they brought out at the beginning as they were fresh out the grease and so yummy. The beer selection wasn't as extensive as Sandy Porter either. Overall I think I will be visiting only the Sandy Porter location as it is definitely a five-star",

Mac's Speed Shop is a themed bar/restaurant and the signs, lights and a themed parkway all call for attention. The atmosphere is also lively and energetic with a more unconventional seating, the tables got bar stools rather than chairs or booths. There also a dozen TVs around giving you enough chances to catch up on the latest ball game. Our waitress was friendly and pretty quick to serve us. Trust me, even when the restaurant appeared crowded we had no wait time to get a table or to get served.   The menu combines the regular American starters - wings are a big part of the menu. Interestingly, the menu also features Mexican Quesadillas, Tacos and Salads options - Might come in handy for that calorie conscious friend. The impressive part of the menu are the BBQ and burger options. The 10z burgers are HUGE and delicious! The only reason I hand to go with 4 stars was because the side of Onion Rings were pathetic and wouldn't expect any mediocre restaurant to serve those!  It's a must try restaurant if you are in Charlotte. Go in for hot crispy Hush Puppies, lovely atmosphere and quick service. Did I also mention that the bill doesn't burn a hole in your wallet!",

    "text": "So, this place is pretty huge. I don't think I've ever seen a bbq place with this much table space (the yelp pictures don't make it look as big as it feels once you're there) - and when we were here, at prime dinner time on a Wednesday a couple weeks ago, more of those tables were occupied than not. So on one hand, service was a little slow, but on the other hand, I give them credit that it wasn't way slower (it wasn't honestly that bad). And it's spacious enough that despite the number of people, it doesn't feel cramped, and you can actually talk to your fellow dinner-goers at your table. Plus if you sit close enough to the front, they have that design aesthetic I love where, even though you're technically inside, the doors are huge and open up, so it feels like outside seating. Extra bonus when we were there, right outside, they had a neat funky band playing (I don't know how frequent that is, though).   It's also a bit pricey (brisket was 18 bucks), but it was great brisket (full of flavor and not too fatty), a large portion, with excellent sauces, and most importantly, every table apparently gets a free basket of hush puppies! Not just that, hush puppies with quite possibly the tastiest whipped honey butter I've had. (The hush puppies were just good, but topped with that honey butter, I would want to eat them every freaking day.) Great expansive selection of reasonably priced craft beer (and cider!), too.",

I've been to this location and the one in Steele Creek. Both are consistent with their food offerings and casual environment. It's a large menu and if you're at a smaller table, it's difficult to have even a glass on the table top with it. One page, but very cumbersome.  I've had the three meat platter with pulled pork, smoked turkey and ribs. Not bad, the turkey tends to be a bit dry. This visit I stuck with the small pulled pork platter with mac n' cheese and sweet potato fries. The fries were cold by the time we got our food but it was a busy night.  About what you expect for a casual bbq joint. Nothing special, but not a dive either.",

Mac's often has live music, which further adds to why I love this place.  Once you sit down, your waitress will bring out warm hush puppies with butter. These hush puppies are so delicious! I have tried many things here - from the BBQ sandwich, to the brisket, to the Thunderbird salad ... they have so many yummy options. The brisket is a personal favorite as it's moist and full of flavor. You can't forget the sides - from the baked beans to the mac and cheese, I haven't had a side I didn't love.  Mac's is located in the heart of South End Charlotte. This is a great place for a bigger group, and a great place to take family or friends who are visiting Charlotte. I love to sit out on their patio and grab a beer on a warm summer night!",

The Mac and cheese is not worth wasting the calories on and the green bean casserole is nothing to be impressed with either. Fries and onion rings mediocre.    Overall great main dish, good service, and good prices.",

    "text": "We have driven pass this place multiple times. It always looked fun and crowded from the outside. We finally had time to stop by recently, and were pleasantly surprised with the food. They give you free hush puppies, which were amazing! We got a BBQ platter with pulled pork, ribs, sausage with sides of onion rings and Brunswick stew. The pulled pork was very flavorful. I really enjoyed it, and I'm not even a big pulled pork person. The Brunswick stew was super tasty. My mouth waters when I think of it. The ribs and sausage were okay, but nothing special. We sat at a high table near the bar in the open patio area. Overall, I really liked the place, and will definitely be back. The only negative is that we ordered another BBQ platter to go, and asked for some hush puppies to go with it, and got charged I  think $1.50 for it. It's nothing to fuss about, but I think it's better for the waitress to mention the charges in advance, to avoid any potential negative feelings.",

The NC BBQ sauce and the SC mustard sauce was unlike anything I've ever tried..... the portions are beyond shareable or plenty leftovers any which way you do it you win! The only negative and I say that loosely was that there was an up charge for the combo plate \"whole bunch\" for choosing the spareribs and brisket which was not printed on the menu. I say full disclosure on pricing is a MUST. That aside it was pricey but worth every penny or in this case dollar.",

Lastly, we were done and ready to go and she came to ask us if we wanted anything else, we said no, usually that means bring the check but she went on to the back took forever and came back to start cleaning tables.

    "text": "Wow.  I was not planning to come here on my trip to Charlotte.  We went to a bar to watch the NBA Rising Stars game and grab a drink etc. and by the time it was over it was late (around 12:30 am on a Friday) and we were hungry.  I used yelp to look up what was in the area that was open and had good ratings and Mac's popped up.  When we arrived, the place was bright and lit up and there were several people inside either enjoying a drink or having some food.  We grabbed a seat at the bar and a friendly waitress/bartender came over and dropped of menus, and then delivered some of the best news of the night... the whole mexicue section is half off till closing!! I promptly ordered a brisket quesadilla ($5.25 with the discount) and a Pulled Pork Taco ($2.50).  The quesadilla was LOADED with brisket and it was really good.  I decided then and there that I was going to come back on Monday to revisit the brisket quesadilla and try one of the other tacos as well as imbibing in the $3.00 pints special they have on Monday night.  Unfortunately I never made it back on Monday b/c I was too full from a lunch from another purveyor of bbq meats, but I still wish I had stopped by on Monday.  This place has a laid back setting, plenty of TVs with sports, and friendly staff.  If I'm ever in the area again, this is one of the first places that I am going for food.",

    "text": "Okay...so this is the thing...  First, before I start, I want to say that I'm leaving this review out of love. I originally gave this place 5 stars. I literally had never had a subpar experience here until tonight. The food is usually hot and ready like Little Caesars and my servers are always on point, but tonight........   Whew chile... MESSY. So on May 24th around 10:30PM, my friends and I decided we wanted some drinks and a nice meal after having our very first \"manifestation night\". We got together and discussed positive things we wanted for our futures and how we could take actionable steps to get there. After tonight, I think we may invite the entire staff that was over outside seating to our next one and manifest positivity and friendliness because everybody's face out there was just as SOUR as could be. I don't know who took a fat #2 on their upper lip, but almost EVERYBODY had the stank face. Literally what manager pissed y'all off in the team meeting beforehand?! I swear when I finally hit it big, I'm buying all of you guys edible arrangements to apologize for whoever called out today and made the shift extra hard!!!! Y'all were FED UP in that room! The spirit of wanna-go-home was THICK in the room tonight!!!! I really want servers, busboys/girls, and bartenders to understand that YOU create the experience for the customer. If you present yourselves to us as if you don't want to be there, we are more than likely going to present that same energy back in the form of your tip.   Notice I said ALMOST everyone had the stank face. Everyone had it except our waitress who will go unnamed because she was a nice girl, but sis, your service was wack and you know it. Friend, you offered us hushpuppies while we decided what we wanted to eat and didn't bring them until you brought our checks and COOKS... they were burnt! Scorched. Char-grilled. MIDNIGHT. We didn't even ask for the hushpuppies. YOU offered them and then disappeared into Narnia. On top of that, y'all only had 3 drafts to choose from for my friend. You brought her a drink menu to pick from the 3???? Lmao. And then never came back to get her drink order. She sat with the menu in her hand until we left lololol. The way you disappeared sis, I think you should've auditioned for Genie in this new Aladdin film. Would've knocked Will Smith clean out the water.    I ALWAYS get ribs when I come here because they are delicious and fall off the bone tender. WHEW! Y'all didn't disappoint on those, but something told me to tell y'all to fry my fries HARDT, but I went against my better judgment and didn't say anything. Just as I thought, they were lukewarm and soggy. From the way those roasted cannonballs called hushpuppies looked, you guys could've just put the fries in the same grease. DAMN.   And lastly, PLEASE turn the fans down. Who are y'all trying to cool off?! The only person who needs fans up that high is BEYONCE and she's hitting constant back-to-back 8-counts. As a contact wearer, I felt like y'all were trying to blind me and y'all don't know me from a can of paint. Hell, were y'all DRYING paint?!  I typically love this place, but tonight was a hot dog ass mess. 2 stars because the ribs were good. Service was a comedy reel sis. A JOKE. I'm not gonna rat you out to the whole Charlotte foodie community because you were friendly the 2 TIMES I saw you the entire night, but just do better.   And yes, I STILL tipped.",

    "text": "We have enjoyed going to Mac's Speed Shop for several years. Tonight, after picking up a carryout order we were quite disturbed.  We ordered two beef rib dinners, two sides each.  When we got back home we discovered that our meals were packed in flimsy cardboard boxes!  The salad was wilted and warm from the steam from other food. One side had been left out completely, one dinner had no bread. We paid $55.00 for meals that were a sloppy mess. While Mac's is a good place to visit, I caution against ordering takeout.  I was told by the manager that the new packing boxes are biodegradable. While that is a nice concept, it degrades the quality of the food.",

I couldn't even get ice in my water, so I walked up to the exposed part of the kitchen and asked where the ice was, the cook said in there-and pointed to the edge of the inside of the kitchen, i was like \"are you sure?\" And he said yes. So I stepped in to get ice and that is when the waitress FINALLY came over to YELL AT ME for getting ice. Yes, you heard right. A WAITRESS yelled at me, A CUSTOMER!

Of course I went to Yelp and looked at the area we were circling. Knowing that my husband will always try barbecue I happened upon Mac's. It wasn't far away and so we started our journey. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the menu and was even more surprised after trying the food.  The barbecue was moist without running with sauce. I found the staff to be very friendly and although they were very busy with a large lunch crowd we did not wait long for service or our food. The inside of this restaurant is decorated similarly to a biker bar. There is not a lot of parking in the area and a couple of places will tow you so be careful.  The brisket was so flavorful and had just enough fat to make it moist without leaving a greasy taste in your mouth.    The collards were delightful.  Perfectly cooked.  I noticed in 2017 they won Whole Hog at Memphis in May. That is a very telling honor  Lastly want to talk about their menu. They have a slew of sides, wings, Mexicue, sauce to go, beer, cider, and barbecue of all kinds.  This is a place you can bring Grandma, Mom, uncle, teenagers, kids and yourself and everyone will always find something to eat.",

Very good wings, very large and perfect smoke flavor.  I also had the southwest salad which is full of delicious stuff.  They have a good thing going here and I recommend this place if you appreciate good smoked meats and awesome beers.",

    "text": "I am unable to write a review of the food, because we never received our meals.  A group of five of us were seated outside, where there was live music.  The band was not so loud that you could not have conversations at the table. It was a little slow getting our first round of drinks, but we didn't mind as we were enjoying the music and people watching.  We finally placed our orders of fried pickles and onion rings along with our meals.  While sitting there, several other parties were seated and their orders taken. Well, the other parties received their appetizers, meals and checks, while we sat.  The waitress had to be flagged down to order a second beverage, which again took much longer than it should given that the place was not very crowded.  After everyone around us had left, the waitress was again flagged down...no we had to find her and ask where our meals were.  She was told that we were getting ready to leave since everyone around us had been served and left...while we waited.  A few minutes later, a man (assuming he was the manager) came to the table and said that he just found out that we had been waiting.  duh...  By this time, we were frustrated and ready to leave.  We were offered the food to go, but it was too late.  We had been there at least 90 minutes...waiting. The waitress never apologized or offered an explanation for the delay.  I believe that she forgot to put in the order to the kitchen. This restaurant probably has good BBQ, but needs to improve its service.",

It claims to be a place for bikes, babes, and beer, and in addition to its great food has an extensive beer selection. This place gets all five stars because it has a nice atmosphere,  service, and great food (especially the wings -- and try the hog wings too!)  One follow-up note: the last two times the wings have not been consistent. Sometimes they are good, but unfortunately leave room for improvement. Still like the place.

    "text": "I can't even imagine how or why I would ever return to this place again.  They clearly need to rethink their staffing.  Especially the blondish Amazon at the hostess stand out front.  She managed to completely ruin a once in a lifetime moment!  I returned to Charlotte to celebrate a landmark birthday with a very close friend.  Oddly enough, when asked where she would like to have dinner, she chose this place after only having been there twice before.  When we arrived, we were asked if we preferred to be seated inside or out.  I turned to my guest and said loud enough for the Amazon to hear, \"It's your birthday, (notice the subtle hint), you decide\"  The place was busy, but there were table dotted throughout the inside dining area.  The Amazon knows this is a birthday dinner.  So where does she seat us?  Under the television, in the back, quite close to the noisy kitchen.  ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!  Because my guest is so gracious, she says nothing.  It only takes a minute or two of not hearing anything the other is saying to know this will not work.  My guest walks back over to the Amazon to ask if we might change to outdoor seating.  It would have to have been quieter than where we were.  We were moved outside with minimal fuss.  Open tables were dotted all around the outdoor seating as well.  Remember, the reason we asked for the change of seating was noise.  Also remember that the Amazon should know this was a birthday dinner.  When the waitress comes over just a few minutes later to take a drink order, we are shouting at each other while barely hearing each other.  Why, you ask?  BECAUSE THE AMAZON SAT US RIGHT NEXT TO THE OUTDOOR STAGE, AND WE HAD NO IDEA A BAND WAS ABOUT TO START.  C'mon!!  By the way, the band was a bunch of old dudes that opened playing a Led Zeppelin tune.  As God is my witness, I have heard high school aged garage bands do it better.  WTF?!  We did the only thing left for us to do - Get the heck out of Dodge!  Some things only happen once in a lifetime.  For what this place did to that once in a lifetime, I can only wish them a slow and painful death....",

    "text": "I recommend the BBQ here, as I didn't have any meat that wasn't tender. However, I prefer the sauce heated and mixed into my pulled BBQ, and found it a little bland on its own. They do offer several different kinds of sauces on the side, and this offers diversity, but heating the sauce with the meat really makes a flavor difference. The ribs were fantastic just the way they come!  I also really enjoyed their chili! They offer an option to serve the chili with cheese and other toppings, which is great with tortilla chips as an appetizer.  Unfortunately, the sides were not great. My brother in law is known for cooking a full pig every few months, and my large Southern family really brings it with the sides, so perhaps I am just partial :) I must say, after trying the greens, beans, fries, slaw, potato salad, and mac and cheese, I was a bit disappointed. The mac and cheese was dry; the greens were too salty and not vinegary at all, the slaw was not very sweet or creamy, and the fries were a little over cooked. The beans and potato salad were good. :)   This was not my favorite BBQ stop because of the sides, which is one of my favorite parts of a BBQ place, and the \"unsauced\" pulled meat. Also, they do not offer fried okra, which I feel is a necessary staple.  The beer selection is quite good, with several local options. Also, they have live music frequently and a good size patio. These elements combine into a great happy hour or evening location!  Overall, try it out for the meat, beer selections, and the ambiance. Though I grew up in NC, by no means am I a BBQ expert, and this is simply my humble opinion.",

    "text": "I'm rating Mac's Speed Shop 2 STARS for HORRIBLE customer service. Now, don't get me wrong, I've been here plenty of times to both eat & drink, but this time, I was introduced to the waitress Amanda who was extremely rude.   So, my friend and I live in South End right across the street from this establishment so we go here quite often, but I've never been treated with such distain. We ordered our food and I got  the Spark Plug burger which is a 10 oz. burger, pepper jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, applewood smoked bacon, chipotle aioli, lettuce, tomato, & onion. I added guacamole and a whole bunch of other items which I think began the hatred towards us. From that point on, Amanda was rude, never checked on us, and just basically acted like we were the scum of the earth (we're paying customers, I thought).   We get our food and it's just the way I like it. I have no complaints about the food. It was a delicious burger. My friend and I finish eating and she brings our checks w/o us even asking did we want anything else. Now, this is where the 2 stars come in. She puts my friends check down on the table and literally THROWS MY CHECK @ ME and walks away!! We both looked @ each other in astonishment. Not only was that rude, but I wasn't done ordering. I wanted another beer, so I literally had to look @ the check for her name to get her attention to place my drink order. She gets an attitude from that. So, my friend pays and she takes the thrown check back b/c she has to update my receipt with my extra drink order. AMANDA never comes back so I get up and proceed to go to the hostess stand to pay/speak with someone. She yells and say \"YOU DIDN'T PAY YOUR BILL\" and I respond \"You never brought it back\". So, I hand her my card and pay for my order per usual, but I leave her two tips:   1) Monetary compensation even though she didn't deserve it.  2) Don't throw checks @ the people that help put food on your table.   Conclusively, I will still go back b/c they have excellent food, but I don't want to deal with Amanda ever.   Side Note: I went to the bar last Sunday and didn't get good service @ all. The only thing I did was have two Blue Moons, but since it was 11:00pm and they were about to close @ midnight, the bartender was not paying us any attention. So, Mac's Speed Shop, PLEASE, get some better servers or adopt a better training program b/c they will be the death of you.   Thanks!  --Your South End Friend",

I sat at the bar because they were closing (it was 11:30) and ordered the pulled pork with 2 sides; mac and cheese and cheese grits.  The pork was ok, very dry and not a lot of flavor until I added additional BBQ sauce on it, i'm not sure if that was because it was so late but I was disappointed since I was craving Carolina pulled pork.  The mac and cheese was good but the highlight of the meal was the cheese grits.  I'd like to come back and give this place another shot but with so many other options I'm not sure I will.",

We were seated for more than 5 minutes before someone came and took our drink order and announced our server would be with us soon. She was. For about 15 seconds. She never checked on us, we never got drink refills, and it took entirely too long to get out check.  Being a former server and bartender, I get the concept of a lunch rush- but I also pay attention, and our server spent significantly more time with her male tables. I usually tip 25% or more for even decently good service, but she was lucky to get the $4 on a $29 dollar bill that we left. I was so taken back by the lack of service.

I've been here twice now and it was disappointing both times. I had the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich the first time and it was dry and bland. I had the spinach salad with blackened chicken today and the chicken was too salty and the flavors just didn't go well together.  It seems like people go to this place more for the ambiance and probably cause it's been a neighborhood favorite all these years. Who knows.   I've had BBQ in Raleigh and so I have a sense of what BBQ is supposed to taste like. With the exception of Soul and the Cellar, the food scene in Charlotte is just sadly mediocre.",

For starters the atmosphere is laid back and cool with a biker/grunge theme that is perfect for grabbing beer with friends and listening to great music.   More important is the food and they knock it out of the park. I have tried many different items on their menu. Barbeque, burgers, beer can chicken, quesadilla, you name it. For me the True winner is their wings. They are some of the best I have had in Charlotte. Not only are they smoked to perfection but they come with a variety of choices for sauces. I find myself always going back to the wings!  Also one time on my way there to join friends I had an embarrassing wipe out on a Lime scooter. My server was kind enough to bring me a wet nap to wipe the blood off my face. Cheers!",

So was the brownie sundae thing (big enough to easily share with a table...or two).  The pulled pork sandwich was disappointing. It tasted over cooked and had very little flavor. Think leftover pulled pork that you forgot to season and left in a fridge a few days and reheated in a microwave.  The margarita was straight syrup. I had a few sips and decided I didn't need that negativity in my life.  So instead I transferred the negativity of my food experience to this review.

No problem - they'd put the order in and gave a beer while we waited. Got the order home and instead of 8 BBQ and 8 buffalo wings, we got 16 extra burned buffalo. My mouth is on fire as I pick bits of crumbling charcoal out of my teeth. I always recommend mac's as the best place for wings in Charlotte. I don't know if I'll ever get them again after tonight. They were practically inedible. The chef knows he shouldn't have sent those out.... Being busy is no excuse. In the past I've given mac's recommendations and 5 stars. After tonight, I don't even want to give you $5. This picture almost makes them look edible.  UPDATE: Mac's contacted me and worked to resolve the problems the next day.

Lot's of sports paraphernalia on the walls, major Southern vibes. Tons of burgers and BBQ options. House made sauces. And complimentary hush puppies! OMG THE HUSH PUPPIES. They serve hot hush puppies with honey butter while you wait for your food, sooooo yummy!  I dont eat meat, so I tried the black bean burger with mushrooms, lettuce/tomato and added some sauce - DELICIOUS! The burger bean patty was kind of big and messy, but I didn't mind. It was super good.   On the down side, the service in here was very mediocre. Our waitress forgot to add something I asked for, we had to flag her down for a good minute.... because we needed straws. She didn't check on us at all. There is def room for improvement in the service department.   Nevertheless, if GOOD FOOD is what you're searching for, and you don't mind some juicy, fried stuff, Mac's is an excellent option. Be mindful this area gets busy during peak hours, and the parking lot can also get full. With all the construction in the area, parking can be a little difficult. But I dont mind, I'll be returning for those hush puppies very soon!",

I got a space in their lot but my daughter had to park down the street.  So be warned. It was very crowded which was a good sign. The place has a lively vibe and the menu choices are certainly ample.  They give you a basket of hot, delicious hush puppies with a cinnamon-like butter while you wait for your food. SCRUMPTIOUS!!  I had a beer chicken with collard greens and baked beans. The banana pudding for dessert was pretty good tThere are a variety of bbq sauces on the table. I enjoyed my food and would certainly go back.  Update:  So I met my daughter for lunch here again and we had the beer can chicken. I had a side of collards and baked beans. My daughter had a side of green bean casserole and Mac and cheese.  Overall, it was all pretty good. My collard greens were delicious. My only concern was the size of my quarter dark chicken. It was HUGE!! Way too much meat. How in the world is the chicken that big?! On a lighter note, the complimentary hush puppies are delicious. I would return, but I wouldn't get the chicken. It kind of scared me. LOL!!",

Had a few local beers on the recommendation of the bartender, she was spot on on 4 of the 5 I had.  I would rate a local west coast style IPA \"higher ground\" as the best.  Also on her recommend, I ordered the burnt ends starter which was quite good ; a good salt rub and sweet bbq sauce. A few pieces were a little dry-ish but when one came along that was moist and easy to chew, it was heaven.   Love meeting new people when I come to places like this and bartenders Amanda and Nadine were so cool!  Not to mention really good at what they do.   Sat and watched the masters with a playlist of classic rock playing overhead.  Finished with Marshall Tucker's \"Can't you see\" which was icing on the cake.  Speaking of cake, they had it but I didn't try it....next time, cuz I plan on coming back.",

I changed from my plan of brisket when I saw that they had smoked wings. They were DELICIOUS! I had the dry rub and the classic hot buffalo flavor. Juicy and flavored perfectly! It is located in a cool little area south of the \"Uptown\" area and had a great patio facing the main road where you can watch passerby and still enjoy the music and see sports on TV. Bustling vibe and great service. Definitely want to stop by again and try more of the menu on my next Charlotte visit! Oh, I almost forgot! The hush puppies and honey butter that they serve when you sit down are THE BOMB! I had to consciously keep myself from hosing down the entire basket within a matter of minutes! So good!",

Today's stop was for a take out order of ribs for my wife. Mac's has a bunch of televisions tuned to sports, a loud rock and roll music channel going and they attract a pretty good biker crowd on some nights. Parking can definitely be a challenge at times and I'm pretty sure that the animal clinic next door won't like you leaving your car there.  Ribs were awesome. Very meaty, very tender, very delicious. I got to smell them in the car the whole ride home and was lucky to get *one* as a tip for the delivery. The rest disappeared as good food tends to do.  Cole slaw was good and tangy, the collard greens were quite sharp.  Overall, we're a fan of Mac's and will be back again.  [Review 9929 overall, 1508 of 2018.]",

Again, it's on the sweet side. I normally prefer a more savory flavor with some heat. The fries were decent. It's nice to have a choice different from normal potato fries.  Service was friendly.

This place was a little loud but it was something we just had to deal with. Not a big deal.   We ordered a few drinks. They gave us some hush puppies to munch on. The dip it comes with was interesting. Nice little snack before our meals. I ordered the \"Spark Plug\" with fries and my husband ordered the \"Pastrami Reuben\" with collard greens.

    "text": "Came to Mac's Speed Shop after seeing great reviews. Frankly I was disappointed.   First of all-parking is difficult. The street parking or the neighbor vet hospital have towing enforcement signs.  The restaurant and bar are cute and waitresses are attractive and flirtatious which is always fun.  Lots of drinking options.  Hush puppies are complementary, but the first order came in cold. We asked for more and this is the highlight of the visit.   Service is rather poor. Refills or checking up on you, or getting condiments were all sub par.   I ordered burger and my friend had BBQ. My burger was supposed to be medium and instead one side was well done, and the other one was raw. I also ordered Mac and Cheese which was terrible. Watered down and tasteless. 99 cent packages I was making in college are better!  My friend's BBQ was about the same. He found a piece of plastic in his pulled pork!!! So much for dinning experience.  If I was a manager, I would certainly retrain the wait staff and hire new cooks!!!",

I ordered the honey BBQ and they were fall off the bone good like literally. Also ordered a banana pudding for dessert that came in a tall glass mug.

The second time, my boyfriend and I were asked to move to a different table (shared with another couple) after already placing our food order, to make room for a bigger party.   And the third time we went for a to go order (to avoid having to interact with the rude people working at macs).

I tried the burnt ends (yum) and ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the mac & cheese. It was relatively cheap and quick, and I loved trying the different sauces (there's like 5-6 different sauces to choose from). The mac and cheese was just okay to me (a little bland).

We had the VTX chipotle and it was just the right amount of sweet and spice (medium). What a great place! Lots of choices for draft beers as well as bottles. Many local beers to choose from. You have to have these wings! We may just have to drive up here from Rock Hill when we have a hankering for some wings.",

    "text": "As far as Charlotte barbeque is concerned, I compare everything to Midwood Smokehouse. Mac's is not that.   I'm pretty easy to please so I went with the basic Hickory smoked pulled pork plate with mac'n'cheese and green bean casserole as the sides. Nothing really caught my attention. The barbeque was ok, the barbeque sauce was meh. The GB casserole may or may not have come out of a couple of cans. I will say that the mac'n'cheese was pretty darn good though. Not a huge portion, but very creamy and cheesy.  Outside of the food, I came in with a group of seven. Instead of putting a few regular tables together for our group, they jammed together three round high-top tables! Everyone was crammed in like sardines, and one guy almost didn't have anywhere to put his plate due to the gap between two tables. Quite ridiculous.  I know some people swear by Mac's. I am definitely down to have another go, and I definitely hope the outcome is more satisfactory.",

We went there today and my daughter got chicken wings.  The skin was so soft and slimy that she could not eat them.  We showed the waitress and asked for another order.  What they did was put her chicken wings, including the one she took a bite from, back on a hot surface and burnt them and returned them to us.  I'm not going to bore you with everything that went wrong... there was plenty, long story short, it was crappy food, slow service and sloppy customer relations.  For $70, I don't expect my daughter to leave hungry.  We can do better at Cookout for a third of the price.",

They host a \"Fatboy Challenge,\" wherein you have one hour to eat a 5lb. sandwich adorned with brisket, pulled pork, burgers, bacon, slaw, pimento cheese, onion rings, all on a sourdough roll, along with a side of mac and cheese. Many have tried, few have succeeded (me being one of them), a free t-shirt and meal to those who do. Flavorful, all the right textures, the bread was chewy on the inside, crusty outside.

    "text": "I've been to Mac's Speed Shop at this location and the one close to Arsley quite a few times and both were alright. The ambiance has a very southern feel and they have both indoor and outdoor seating. I've been to quite a few BBQ places in North Carolina and Virginia and there isn't really much to rave about Mac's in my personal opinion.   You do get free hushpuppies when you sit down with a nice creamy buttery spread, which is unique to most BBQ places. The only food item I would recommend getting here would be the pulled pork nachos. If I were basing my review solely on those, Mac's would get a 5/5. They have a great ratio of cheese to toppings and the portion size is huge. They have decent specials every day, with Sundays having $4 bloody mary's which is also a plus.   However, besides those things, this place is just kind of meh. I've come here many times, trying various things on their menu to finally find something other than the nachos that I like, and have been unsuccessful. I've gotten their Asain-style crispy shrimp taco and brisket taco...good portion size for the price but the flavor was lacking a lot. Both their black bean and brisket quesadillas are very dry. I've had friends who have tried their salads and nothing really to brag about there either. I've tried their sidecar combo (where you can choose either 3 or 4 sides as your entree which is unique to most places) and chose to get their mac and cheese, chili, and a side salad. The salad automatically comes with bacon bits so PSA. Mac and cheese was okay and the chili was very very thick. Lastly, I've also gotten their pulled pork sandwich and pulled pork platter, good portion size for the price, but the flavor is just lacking and it has always been dry.   Overall, if you want a relatively cheap meal with decent portion sizes, are in the mood for BBQ/Southern style food and do not really care too much about the taste, I would recommend going here. Nothing has tasted bad, it just doesn't really taste good to me in my opinion. Service has always been fast and polite. You won't exactly be disappointed, you just won't go bragging about this place to your friends after in my opinion.",

    "text": "This is a review of a BBQ place through the eyes of a vegetarian (aka what happens when you're outnumbered by carnivores).   Ordered the fried pickles with ranch sauce as an appetizer - pretty good. A little salty but the taste of the fried pickles and ranch sauce was pretty perfect. Pickles are sliced like coins, not kept long/cylindrical then fried. That's one thing I noticed. Made it a little harder to dip In the tub of ranch.  I ordered the black bean burger and the Mac n' Cheese as a side.   The black bean burger wasn't so much of a burger as it much of a sloppy joe. The burger itself was too mushy for my liking. The guacamole was DELICIOUS as a topping on the burger. So were the mushrooms. I approve the variety of toppings/\"fixins\" that they had available.  Mac n' cheese... like many of these reviews state... was pretty awesome. You should probably get this as a side if you can.  The service was okay - I think it was a little difficult to catch the waitress' eye for the check. She came by quite a bit on her own during the meal to ask if everything was good though, which I appreciated.  Oh also, we randomly got a basket of hush puppies? First time I've ever tried them but they were great. Good job.",

A server immediately came up to us and asked what we wanted to drink. She grabbed our drinks and brought us hush puppies (as their complimentary appetizer). While we were waiting for the last friend to show up she asked if we wanted to order an appetizer while we waited and I got the fried pickles!  The pickles were pretty good! Burned my tongue a couple of times because I couldn't wait till they cooled off! Our friend finally showed up at 6:20 and the server was no where to be found!  He finally got our drink, and she walked off before we were able to ask to have our orders put in. Once we ordered, the food actually came out pretty quickly. The brisket platter was the entree I ordered. I got fat and lean mixed brisket, with mac and cheese and collard greens as my sides. The brisket was thick cut (which I do not mind at all) but it was a bit on the dry side. The mac and cheese was sooooo yummy. I could have eaten a whole bowl. And the collard greens were a bit too vinagery for my liking, but they weren't too bad.   We were only checked on once, and then when she asked if we needed anything else we asked for the checks (and a box for my leftovers).   The food is good (expect for the dryness of my brisket - but I did try some pork that was pretty good). But the server seems a bit slower and no where to be fine sometimes.",

She came by every few minutes asking if everything was okay, etc. When you are trying to relax and have a conversation, it gets a little annoying. Not bad having attentive service, but just a little over the top :)   Now, the food was what brought this place down a couple stars. It all sounded good, but the items we had were either lackluster or simply not good.   The good: -Grits. Just awesome. The highlight of the meal.   The okay: -Smoked wings. They did have a great smoke flavor and the dry rub allowed the smoke to really be tasted. However, they were soggy. I have had smoked and grilled wings plenty of time, and it's possible to get the wings crispy. These were just flimsy. -Greens side. Tasty, albeit a little too salty.   The not good: -Deviled eggs. Probably the most boring deviled eggs we've ever had. Tasted soapy.  The place deserves 2.5 stars. I couldn't justify giving it an A-OK 3 star, as it's not A-OK. While this place works in a pinch, there's better wings, deviled eggs, bbq, etc. in Charlotte. Skip it.",

Our server was very tentative and pleasant--our food came out fast, and piping hot.  I usually go with their brisket or pulled pork--tonight was the brisket. My baby had the fried catfish, with Brunswick stew and the Mac-n-cheese.  Fish was fired to perfection, and portions are big, she always ends up with a doggy bag.  Been traveling quite a bit lately so had to stop for my Macs fix.",

    "text": "Charlotte has no shortage of terrific BBQ joints, but for my money, the Mac's in South End sits near the top of the heap. The Q itself is excellent, as are the sides (I particularly recommend their Mac & Cheese). My dish of choice is the Pulled Pork Platter, although the brisket, wings and ribs are also superb.   But as good as the food may be, what REALLY keeps me coming back is the beer selection. Mac's has dozens of craft beers on tap and in bottles, taking particular care to showcase local and regional brews.   This casual, family-friendly spot has ample seating, both inside and out, and service is friendly and prompt. Parking can be tight during peak hours, so be prepared to leave your car a couple blocks away. But whatever you do, don't miss one of the best BBQ joints in the Queen City.",

I feel like you can't go wrong here.   My go to is the quarter beer can chicken. I get it \"naked\" and just mix all of the sauces at the table (which are awesome). For sides, I stick with mac and cheese and green bean casserole. I'm never able to finish it all and for $9, I think it's a great value. My boyfriend has had their catfish and their pulled pork and liked both.   I don't think this is the BEST barbecue in town (my vote for that goes to, hands down, Midwood Smokehouse) but I think this is a great spot nonetheless.",

    "text": "I'm going to start this review off by saying that I really look forward to giving this place another chance on a non-busy day. My bestie and I were in need and in the mood for a quick catch-up over BBQ food. We came on a hot, July Saturday evening around 7:00 pm and was met by a packed patio and parking lot. We both ended up parking on a side street near the vet hospital (we arrived at different times). I got there first and was told there was a 20 minute wait and told the hostess stand that there was no preference in outdoor or indoor seating.  By the time my bestie and her friend showed up, our table was ready - it ended up being about a 10 minute wait. We were seated outside and our drink orders were taken. The outdoor seating was quite loud and sweaty. It was a 90 degree day but they do have fans, just not that many outside. I placed a drink order for a Sam Adams grapefruit beer. However, when our waitress came back, she let me know that their keg was practically out and gave me what she could. I ended up with a glass that was just a little under half full :)   We placed our orders - I ordered the little pig sandwich (pulled pork) with onion rings. Our food came out extremely promptly which made me think that they had plates that were already ready due to the lukewarm temp of my plate. My onion rings, seasoned very well, were not that hot which is a cardinal sin when it comes to onion rings. However, I did like that they were not your typical, thick, and overly battered rings. The sandwich was just the right size but, again, just not that hot. Good but not great.  The waitress did not charge me for the beer and was very efficient with everything else and checking on our needs. I wouldn't run back to Mac's but I definitely wouldn't count it out. I look forward to giving it another shot under different and cooler circumstances.",

So I was worried I might not get my food quickly etc. the waitress was prompt and I had my food within minutes.   I went with the large pulled pork meal. The portions were massive and the pork was tender and delicious. They have an array of different BBQ sauces to compliment the meat. I ordered onion rings and Mac and cheese. The rings were straight bomb. They were cooked to perfection. Crispy but not overly crispy and the onions on the inside were perfect too. The mac was a tad bit greasy but nothing to complain about.   It is definitely a place I will go to again. The prices are good, the service is on point and the atmosphere is 100%.",

    "text": "I went to Mac's for a last meal with friends in Charlotte, where I spent the weekend for a wedding. A few friends (also visiting) had gone and said good things, so I thought it was worth checking out. On first impression, Mac's is \"cool\". It has great ambiance, with outdoors/indoors seating, a biker vibe, and generally a fun atmosphere. Definitely a nice place to go with friends. It also has a solid beer list (didn't look at the wine/cocktails, was far too hot that day).  Regarding the food, my impressions were mixed. The wings were excellent (baked, as all wings should be, not fried), as were the sides (hush puppies, mac & cheese, onion rings). However, the BBQ itself was not good. We had pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and sausage. The sausage was good, and everything else was below-average. Somewhat disappointing after the excellent wings we had.  One more thing, if you advertise all sorts of different sauces on your wings, as Mac's does, it's important that the server know the difference between them and can tell us which wings are which. Our server didn't tell us, and when we asked him, it was pretty clear he was guessing. Underwhelming presentation.  I would consider going again, because the wings/sides were excellent, and the place has a great vibe. However, the BBQ itself, which should be the lynchpin of a restaurant like this, is nothing to write home about. There must be better BBQ joints in Charlotte.",

My friend and I were so excited to eat and drink after five years and our final day of work... And for some reason our server (receipt says Jennifer) had an attitude from the moment she greeted us. We were nothing but chill and friendly and not high-demanding at all. (An order of food each and a beer each. We would've stayed for more but we were just so uncomfortable we left.) I'm talking would set things down and not even speak to us. The BBQ chicken nachos were dry - dried shredded cheese - had to ask for warm queso to pour on them and could've even used more but was afraid to ask. Terrible service, sad to say.",

A great casual place to hang out. A bit messy inside and very loud. Not a great place for desserts. Last time I went there they were using porto potties which isn't cool.",
