The place is pretty popular for the \"out-of-the-office\" types, sitting with their laptops at tables for hours at a time.  The only two things that I would say are negatives is that the place tends to get very loud with a lot of background noise from neighboring tables. And the coffee refills aren't free.  Great bagel flavors, including several that they don't have at Panera. I like the Pumpernickel and the Jalapeno. Both are excellent. These are \"real\" bagels, unlike the stuff you might pick up a supermarket. They're made the right way, even if they aren't as good as New York. (Ha ha.)  They have a \"deal\" for a bottomless coffee mug. Only $129 for the year. So if you stop by Bruegger's often enough (at least twice a week), it might work out for you. I was hoping for something way cheaper!",

The bagels are usually acceptable but, compared to other locations, occasionally skimpy and/or undercooked.  Unfortunately, staff turnover at this store seems to be a way of life and through circumstance or choice they are shorthanded by at least one counter person every visit.  The predictable result is long waits.  Placing the coffee urns behind the counter means yet more delays as staff must do the pouring.  They've got plenty of room at the coffee/tea station and it's well past time to move the coffee urns out there even if it means hauling them back to make fresh coffee occasionally, just as Panera et al must do.  This store really is the devil's candy - great location, expansive seating area, outdoor tables - but the slowness of service invariably causes one to ask 'Why bother?' especially when other Bruegger's locations without these problems are nearby.",

The guy who started to make my bagel didn't hear me the first few times I told him what I wanted (Sriracha Blues sandwich on a bagel) and kept looking back at the board to see the ingredients.  The other employee kept coming over to help him and at one point raised her voice almost to the point of yelling to show where ingredients were.  I waited between 10 and 15 minutes (by which point 8 people were in line now).  The female employee couldn't find anyone's order on the computer and attempted to hand me someone else's order.  She ended up handing the bag over instead of putting the bagel in it.  I was on the sidewalk when I opened it up and realized they gave me the sriracha egg bagel (breakfast item).  I don't eat bacon which was one problem, but if I'd had a more pleasant experience, it wouldn't have bothered me that much.  The sandwich itself was good, just not what I ordered.",

It has salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, onions and capers on the bagel of your choice.  The place does get busy so you may want to allow some time.

I usually get the Bagel thin sandwich with turkey sausage, egg white, and sun-dried tomato spread. It's a great lunch item thats around 400 calories and you can choose whichever bagel you want, all for $4. I would like to see more variety for the bagel sandwiches on the healthy items menu though. Overall, its a good place and atmosphere.",

Then I came to the Park Road Shopping Center and saw there was one and was immediately thrown back to my childhood. Their bagels always taste amazing and I love that you can see straight into the kitchen through a glass wall. The only thing they leave up to your imagination is what you want in your bagel. Everything is made to order and fresh when you order it. Highly recommend!!",

The food- I ordered the siracha blues bagel guy and I was very excited. Sadly the person who made mine was very flustered and didn't put any of the ingredients on the bagel other than chicken and cheese. There was no siracha or blue cheese or lettuce or anything. So my bagel was dry and boring. The chicken was also very cartilage-y.   The line process is confusing and unorganized as each worker makes a bagel from start to finish and there was about 6 of them. Usually at places with assembly line food ordering 2-3 people help build one bagel so it's an assembly line process and you move down the line and you're use to it. Here they were shouting at people in line to move forward but people were so confused because it appeared as though they had to cut people to order their bagel.  My friends have had amazing bagels here and compared the environment and style to Tim Hortons of Canada! I plan to give it another go.",

    "text": "Time to rant. I go to this Bruegger's location often since I work in the area. I go for lunch though, since I am not a bagel person. Their sandwich's are actually pretty good.   Two things that bother me here. When I tell the person making my sandwich what I want, why do they have to use those red or black grease pencils to write on the very paper they make my sandwich on. They write on the paper then lay the bread down almost on top of the writing. And then that gooky grease pen stuff gets on your bread. Who's idea was this? It's terrible and sends a bad message.   The other issue I have here is the cleanliness and readiness of the dining area. I was there at 2pm, so it wasn't crowded at all. Employees standing around doing nothing. Yet, the condiments bar was totally out of napkins and the trash was overflowing. And EVERY SINGLE TABLE that wasn't being used was dirty. So, I am left to sit at a crumb filled table left over from some stranger. After spending about 20 minutes there, not once did someone come out to clean..",

    "text": "Believe it or not, this was my FIRST time enjoying ANYTHING at Bruegger's. I've never been big on bagels until recently. However, I'm a HUGE fan of Caribou Coffee... so I figured, why not?  Well to sum it up nicely, I wasn't really sold on the Bruegger's Bagel experience. It took about 20 minutes for me order and pay for a breakfast bagel... there were two people in front of me but 7-8 by the time I finished paying. The organization of orders kind of caused things to drop out of whack... especially after one person order a few boxes of bagels and a couple of large boxes of coffee. Also, one of the associates kept having to remind people to get on the register, as I was trying to checkout... there was one associate that was more concerned with cleaning and replacing the tap-ends on the soda machine... shouldn't that have been done before the breakfast rush?   My breakfast bagel was a little rubbery so not enjoyable, to say the least.   HOWEVER, as chaotic as it all seemed, the staff was really pleasant and apologetic for anyone having to wait in line. For that alone (and with it being 7AM in the morning) I think they are trying and I will probably give them another shot some time in the future... this time with just a plain bagel and cream cheese! :-)",

I think they have more people in here working on their laptops and conducting meetings than they actually have patrons.  There's also a Caribou Coffee inside the same space.  Wide selection of different types of bagels and fresh squeezed orange juice. My go to bagel is a plain bagel with light veggie cream cheese and cucumber slices.  I've been comimg here for over ten years and the service is usually fairly quick and the bagels are always fresh.  You can also build your own salad and make various sandwiches on a bagel bun.  I did have sweet tea today that wasn't very good.  Sweet tea at any restaurant can vary from batch to batch so I wasn't upset.  They were accommodating and swapped it out for a soda instead without any problems.  Will I come back here, yes.  Lots of people come here to study or work on various things on their laptops. Honestly, I think it's too loud in here to focus but it seems to work for a lot of people. The interior has been remodeled various times through out the years. Nice and clean. You can also watch the employees make fresh bagels through a large glass window. I've never had their coffee but mom says it's better than caribous coffee. There's also an area out front with tables and chairs that I've seen lots of customers being their dogs to. Ample parking available close to the Brueggars.",

What an excellent selection of bagels and varieties at this location! I stopped in for lunch and to catch up on some work and was more than pleasantly surprised with my visit.  I walked up to the counter and everyone was smiling and singing to the music, very happy to help and that is what will keep me coming back as a customer! I ordered the trio, by far the best deal on the menu...you get any bagel sandwich, soup or chips and a drink for $6.99.   I chose the turkey chipotle (turkey and peppered bacon) on a rosemary and olive oil bagel with lettuce, jalapenos, onions and chipotle mayo. Toasted, of course with chips as my side. I asked that they make the bacon extra crispy and they were more than happy to oblige :)   The sandwich was absolutely delish! Loved the rosemary and olive oil bagel and they piled on the toppings! The chips are all kettle cooked, my absolute favorite so I was clearly a fan!  Best thing about this place outside of that customer service and yummy food was the abundance of outlet plugs and booths for everyone to enjoy the free Wi-Fi!!! Everywhere I looked there was a chair or booth and outlet which was wonderful! And I don't know if it a regular thing but the tunes today were amazing...nothing but old school classics...I could help but bop my head and jam on....  That my friends is as good as it gets! Can't wait to go back!!  Don't forget about the specials on Wednesdays, so be sure to drop in!",
