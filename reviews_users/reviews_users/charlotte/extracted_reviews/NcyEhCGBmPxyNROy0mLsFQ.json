    "text": "City Smoke kinda goes up in flames.  We showed up around 7pm on a Friday night, and our first clue should have been that the restaurant was almost empty.  However, we were hungry, so we threw caution to the wind, grabbed two bowls of peanuts, and were shown a table.  After deciding not to throw our shells on the floor, we perused the menu.  As a place that quickly establishes itself as a BBQ joint, the menu seems disjointed; oysters on the half shell and peel & eat shrimp co-mingle with sliders on the appetizer menu, and shrimp & oyster po-boys are listed above the omnivores' pork, chicken, and brisket sandwich options.  But the True blasphemy surfaced once the meal arrived.    Y'all, the mac & cheese was NOT GOOD.  Grainy, tasteless, and altogether sub-par macaroni and cheese is unacceptable in a BBQ restaurant.  And the fried okra was overly salty without packing much flavor.  At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how great the meat is at a BBQ joint (and keep in mind, City Smoke's meat is nothing to write home about); if your sides aren't stellar, you might as well shut down shop.  Between the four of us, we ordered the brisket, rotisserie chicken, and pulled pork, but no one was overly complimentary of the meatsplosion on the table.  We had three sauce options: one was vineagar based, and the other two tomato-based ones tasted almost exactly the same.  Our service was okay, but I think that's mostly attributed to the fact that our server only had one or two other tables to attend to.  Maybe City Smoke burned brightly at one point, but the flame has died.",

I ordered some wings and i ate the large bbq wings which was really good.   My friend had a bacon burger and that was pretty greasy. But overall it was a big burger that tasted great!

Bad points:  Food came out luke warm / cold (including the chicken which was moist). Sides were not good (tried the Mac and cheese, Cornbread, beans, okra).  None of us finished our meals, it was pretty close to inedible.  The 3 sauces on the table were bad individually, but when combined were not that bad (not good, just not that bad).  If someone tries to bring you here talk them into going to Queen City Q instead. You'll get a great meal there.  I am not sure why so many people wrote bad reviews and gave 3 stars.",

The brisket was lean and looked like they trucked it in.  The cheese muffin that came with the combo tasted days old and dry - so gross.

    "text": "City Smoke is garbage. My friends and I ended up here after a Bobcats game since it's a short distance from the arena and it's a decision I wholeheartedly regret. First it's extremely dark which isn't necessarily a problem except we ended up using our cellphones to read the menu. That's a bit much. Second the service was horrible despite the place being nearly empty. I could forgive all of that if the food had been good. It's not.  We ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer, and to the restaurants credit at least those were fresh from the fryer. They don't taste good, but at least they were cooked to order. That's more than I can say for the rest of it.  I got fried chicken where the meat was cooked but the batter was still wet around the meat. They obviously cook the meat in the oven beforehand and then batter and flash fry it. Better than getting raw chicken but still pretty nasty. I ordered the Mac&Cheese which was bland, and the okra which was flavorless and hard. I assume that comes from hours under a heat lamp.  The meal also came with Texas Toast that tasted like charcoal. I can understand one or two things being sub par but  the entire plate?   My friends got a BBQ sandwich which she took two bites from and stopped eating saying it tasted \"funky\" and the other got the BBQ platter that had a little bit of everything : brisket, ribs, pulled pork.  He said everything was terrible and having tried all the signature sauces on the table I could only imagine.   For such a nice location, the food is worthless. I don't see how they stay in business except tricking people into coming in once, because they certainly won't come back. I'd give it less than 1 star but that's not an option. Please, give this place a pass or you'll end up like me, wasting money (I didn't pay for the chicken dish, but paid for the tea and pickles) and ending up at Denny's where I could get something edible.",

(1:30pm on a Monday)   Very nice and clean inside with plenty of seating. Read a review about a larger group. While it does have plenty of tables and booths and counter top space I can see why and how a group could be a problem.  As for the food, very very good. Didn't know what to order so I ordered the combo: brisket, pulled pork, 3 different kind of ribs with two side.  The brisket was delicious, and all three of the ribs were very very good. The pulled pork lacked a lot of flavor but this could be because I enjoyed the brisket so much.   Each of the ribs had their own different taste w the sauce and dry rub. Which is always good. The brisket had a good smokey flavor to it.  I had Mac and cheese and dust fries. The waitresses recommended the chili and the fried okra topped with something.   Service was extremely good and fast. Never had to wait. And there was 6-7 other tables at this time of day.  I will be a repeat costumer, probably at some point this week.  They also offer brisket burgers which may be what I try next!   Plenty of options: salads, BBQ, burgers, starters, fish. They have something for everyone!",

The coleslaw was good, Brunswick stew also small and salty.     Barkeep cleared my plate and brought check without asking if I wanted another beer or dessert, etc. like she was in a hurry to get rid of me at 8:00 pm on a Wednesday night.

No frills or glitzy or glamorous stuff, just comfy seating and wood/barn'ish decor.    The food just didn't do it for me.  My girlfriend and I decided to split the combo meal which had an assortment of pulled pork, ribs and brisket.  Most memorable was the brisket.  It was flat, very poorly sliced and just not tasty.  The ribs gave the meal a little bit of redemption but overall just not great.  The drinks....woah....love it.  Glycol taps?  Nothing better to make your beer ICE cold!  The selections as far as beer are probably as good as any I've seen in Charlotte.  No, they don't have 78 taps, etc. etc. but truthfully I don't want that.  I just want a few great ones.  They have exactly what I like...Bell's Two Hearted, Hopslam, etc.  All in all I think this is a great place for happy hour, just not somewhere I'll be going to grub on some BBQ.",

We sat right down on a Wednesday night, and were quickly helped by our attentive server. After browsing over the menu, we both decided to go with the classic-sounding Hickory Smoked Pork, with mac n' cheese & roasted baby carrots as my side. This meal was only $12. Everything was better than expected. The portions were perfect, and the pork was so fresh and tender, I think it's the best I've had in the Charlotte area. Our server also brought us bottles of eastern & western NC barbecue sauce for our pulled pork (I always favor the western NC red sauce). It was a little difficult to have a conversation across the table, but we still enjoyed the company. I would definitely recommend City Smoke to anyone looking for quality food in the uptown Charlotte area.",

    "text": "City Smoke was the first BBQ place I've been to since I moved to the Carolina's. I'm seeing there are only 3 stars and I'm not sure why.   The atmosphere is cool, really laid back and has a brewery feel to it, which I like. They have chalkboards with all of their drink specials posted and they serve local beers, which I also like. My friend and I posted up in City Smoke for a couple hours to sip some drinks and have a couple snacks and other than the general location, we weren't disappointed.  What I mean by the location is that, it's hard to have that real BBQ feel in the middle of a city, for me anyways. I tend to think a BBQ joint would be the most legit as a hole in the wall, and city smoke is more contemporary. That doesn't mean it wasn't good! We got a couple local beer flights, the cucumber-jalapeno cocktail and the bacon bourbon bloody mary. The cucumber-jalapeno cocktail kicked my ass. That thing was so strong and it wasn't that spicy, it was more refreshing. The bacon bourbon bloody mary stole the show though. It was hearty but sweet at the same time, in a good way. Just try it, you won't be disappointed.  Finally, after like 2 hours of sipping making small talk with our server (he was pretty cool and recommended some other bars for us to check out), we ordered food. We shared a combo platter so that we could try everything. It came with two types of ribs, pulled pork, brisket and a couple sides.  The green beans were decent, mac n cheese, killer. The meat was on point though. The ribs were tender, the pulled pork flavorful and the brisket was smoky. I was very pleased with everything we ate.  If you're in the downtown area and looking for some BBQ, you should try this place out. It's slightly hidden though. It's like built into a big glass building, you have to really look for it but it's worth it.",

    "text": "Good, not great.  I love the interior. The big square bar is nice with the 3 HD screens to hold your attention. They also have like a 'BBQ Bar' where you can sit at stools and watch the cooks prepare your entree of choice in front of you.   Ordered the City Smoke Chicken wings for $5. They were served hot and tender. They were accompanied by blue cheese and 'Devil's Butter'. Def worth the $5, but not exactly the greatest wings Ive ever had.   For my entree I ordered Kansas City Slathered ribs. The half rack was $13, the full was $19. The ribs were def tender and moist. I got Mac-n-cheese and baked beans as an appetizer. I dunno, for some reason I wasn't a fan of the Mac-n-cheese. They did something funny with the cheese, didn't taste like something grandma would make. The baked beans were up to standard.   Service was great.  Music was great.  Even though there's still some kinks to be worked out, I'll def be back.",

    "text": "So HOW does this place stay in business??? Imagine filling up your bath tub full of SALT....the very fine kind. Now, deep fry your fries and immediately submerge them in the middle of the salt bath....and leave them in for 15 minutes. Then pull 'em out and eat. Well, that is the recipe for City Smoke fries! Trust me, I am definitely a Salt-o-holic. When I think something is TOO salty, my GAWD it must truly be SALTY! All I can still taste is SALT.   Last time I came in, I had their brisket, and it wasn't very good. So I stuck to something safe....a Patty Melt. Now the burger meat itself wasn't that bad, but they also salted the outside of their bun. Who does that?  I'm guessing here that the owners of City Smoke own lots of Stock in Morton's. I have NEVER been so innundated by salt flavors in my life. It's been an hour since I left here and I still taste SALT.  I may NEVER have to use salt again....I think my tastebuds have been permanently salted. In Baseball, you get 3 strikes. In Paul-Ball, you get 2. City Smoke you are OUT!",

The food was good and fairly priced for bbq but I felt it was a bit more spicy than average and most Southern palettes will find it has too much heat for them.",

We kicked off with fresh oysters and a bourbon/whiskey flight that was great. It helped that Morgan knew what and where everything was from it also helped she had an opinion....and always a smile.  The oysters were fresh and the roasted ones were perfection. What a great surprise.  I order the half duck, which was so big it must of come from Chernobyl Ukraine. I can't remember having duck that big. It was crispy, a little smokey and aus jus was the right balance. The petite roasted potatoes were the right size side, enough to compliment the meal but not too much food.  Dessert was he banana pudding. Made with meringue instead of whipped cream it was delicious. Although, my friend got powdered sugar on his, which is the only gripe of the nite lol.  Very casual & delicious.  I'll be back",

Our waiter was clearly new and constantly flustered the whole time he was serving us which a point annoying but fine the 1st day is scary for everyone. But the food was incredibly sub par and the pricing is a scam. I ordered a side of fries my parents split a 25 dollar dish and my sister an 11 dollar dish yet we ended up with a 75 dollar bill. My sister had a pulled pork sandwich with so much fat she could barely eat 3 bites of it. The mac and cheese must have been from the very bottom of their supply to be so lukewarm and strange tasting as my mother described it. When we complained to the manager about the food he left halfway through our complaints to get more food which at that point was the last thing we wanted.

Ended up ordering the 8 Texas ribs and jalapeno coleslaw and jalapeno cornbread and Mac and cheese $17.  First the sides: Mac was overdone and pretty bland, nothing to remember.   Jalapeno cornbread was also on the overdone side but still moist and flavorful. Not too spicy at all.   The coleslaw was by far my favorite of the three.   Now the ribs: I'm a traditionalist when it comes to ribs. Dry rub, no sauce and heavy smoke. Low and slow is the way to go. When I do my own ribs they normally take 5-6 hours. These are spareribs so don't expect baby backs (strike one) while plenty of flavor the ribs where very fatty and a little dry. Also I've never seen a BBQ joint put more rub on after the ribs were cooked this was weird and completely unnecessary. They likely would've been better without the extra seasoning.   Overall, this place is so so. The atmosphere is pretty cool, food is OK (edible) but nothing special about this place.   Take this one piece of advice: If it doesn't smell like a smokehouse when you walk in, turn around and walk out. Find your BBQ elsewhere.",

I think without us being there, there would not have been a very big crowd. We were just going to have drinks, but they let us hang at the bar, with 2 adjoining tables, so several of us also ordered food.  First, I was very impressed with the Bourbon/whiskey selection. This isn't something I know much about, but been trying to grow my palate in this area. They have an extensive list of Kentucky Bourbons, plus different scotch whiskey's, etc. They aren't cheap, but if you want to try some Bourbon, this is definitely a great place.  They also have probably 10 craft beers on tap.  Since this is a BBQ place, I got the Pork Sandwich. I thought it was very tasty, comparable to Mac's and other better BBQ places I've been to in Charlotte.   If you want a quiet place to hang out, sip some bourbon, grab a BBQ sandwich, this place has a nice vibe, and nice location. I'll be back.",

So, we quietly just gathered our stuff and walked out of the door.  At this time, Dan, the manager saw us and asked what happened, we told him and he apologized and asked us to stay; he comped our appetizer, first round of drinks and was personally our server.  He took great care of us, was very apologetic, extremely knowledgeable of the menu, had wonderful suggestions and was friendly to our children as well!    My husband is a bourbon fan and the bourbon selection here is wonderful.  I had the pineapple smash, with muddled grilled pineapple and it was amazing! Chicken wings, prime rib and the burger were all wonderful as well and cooked to perfection.  Because of Dan and the experience he provided, after a rough start, we will be back for sure!",

She quickly asked us were we ready to order. I said yes, but had to ask her to tell us her name. She smiled and said Rachel. We have her our order for the evening through desert. She came back withing 15 minutes with our appetizers. The wings were awesome. My husband enjoyed his garlic shrimp too. We then waited another 25 minutes for our entrees. The manager had to come over and reassure us that our orders would be out soon. Once everything came out, we both enjoyed our meals. My husband had the lamb which was extremely tender. I had the meat combo meal with potatoes and collards. I didn't care too much for the pork or the bbq sauce. The ribs and brisket were good though. I would go back specifically for the wings.

Both he and the other manager Dan were equally responsive to my emails and phone calls in advance of the dinner.  On the day of, they graciously placed my decorations on the table and made sure that our guest of honor was acknowledged with a complimentary champagne toast.  The service was top-notch and the food was delicious, but most of all the pre-fixe group menu was a great deal for what we got.  I'm so thrilled with how our group dinner turned out , and I can't thank Dan and David enough for working with me to ensure we enjoyed our celebration. I highly recommend this restaurant to all!",

    "text": "Okay, so I'm not one to write reviews, but I feel like this had to be done. I went on Sat night for Queens Feast and wanted to check this place out because I had a gift card. I've had 2 wonderful experiences during Queens Feast -- both great quality & portion sizes (Paco's Tacos & The Liberty) if we are naming places. Therefore; I had pretty high expectations of this place.  For starters one of the appetizers wasn't being offered anymore that we wanted. No biggie, so we get a cheese plate & chicken wings. The cheese plate came with 2 things of cheese that looked and tasted like butter (pretty positive it was), un-pitted olives & 4 crackers. The wings were super chewy. That's all I have to say about that.  Main entree we ordered was a filet with squash and the rotisserie chicken with mac & cheese. The filet was probably the size of my palm & the squash was maybe 2 of my palms put together. The chicken was ehhh & a good portion size..nothing special, but not terrible. I did however like the mac & cheese!  On to Dessert, that's hard to mess up with me because I love sweets. Well..the cheesecake tasted like a frozen one that came from Walmart. Tres Leches Cake was meh. It's not that they were gross, but it wasn't anything exceptional.   By the end of the night my date looked at me and said \"So wanna go get some real food after this?\" - thankfully this wasn't our first date because that would have been terrible. Maybe we had a bad experience because it was the end of Queen's Feast, but I'm not real sure I will be going back again to try.",

The chicken was very dry and the sides looked like they had been sitting out for hours.  It was restaurant week so maybe it is usually better but that was our first and last time. We had to go over to Aria to eat after leaving City Smoke.",

What I was looking for was favorable meats at a reasonable price, and that is what I got.  Staff was friendly, especially the manager.    My sides were the cole slaw, which was great, and the brussel sprouts, which were good but I have had better.  The meat itself was smokey and meaty.  The meat was not overly fussed with and the que sauce was on the side.  Didn't have dessert but they all looked good.    The wings were also spot on (I love a good smoked / BBQed wing) with nice char and flavor, and were priced comparable to chain wingeries.  I'm in town for three weeks and will probably hit this place up a few times a week.  The food is good and priced well.  Check it out, you will be glad you did!",

    "text": "Queens Feast Extravaganza!    Whiskey or beer, whiskey or beer.  What a dilemma.  I finally settled on a \"Kentucky Mule\", which was prepared perfectly.  I had planned to get a beer after, but it was so good I had another mule instead.  Served in the appropriate copper mug, which makes it all the better.  (Side note: One time in Charleston the restaurant I was at tried to upcharge for the mug.  It seemed silly and I didn't do it, so I got to drink a Mule out of a regular glass.  It was still OK, but since the mug makes it that much more special, I was a little frustrated by the experience). Pleasantly and more appropriately, there was no mention of that kind of nonsense here.  Kudos for not being ridiculous like that.  This Queens Feast week deal was hard to pass up, they made practically their entire menu available.  It was very difficult to choose, but since the opportunity seems to come along less and less, I went for Chef Adam's Rotisserie Feature (Prime Rib).  It was everything I hoped it could be, and done just right.  I opted for the \"pee wee\" potatoes as well, although they did offer any side from the menu, not just this suggested pairing.  I went for dry rubbed chicken wings for a starter, and with five at our table everyone else got something different, so we tried most of the the starters available.  We all agreed the wings were the clear winner (although it was all delicious).   We all picked the Deep Dish Bourbon Pecan Pie for dessert.  It was large enough and sweet enough I brought half home for later!  Service was extremely attentive, we will definitely be going back here again soon.",

When the lady next to me ordered her pulled pork sandwich, she got a large sandwich versus what I seen in the other places.  I will be back to try out other items on the menu.  I went back there with the crew. The flavors in the BBQ are ok. Normally the local spices chosen for BBQ come through in the process. Unless I missed something I didn't taste anything.  I had the BBQ Pork sandwich.  The help was friendly as usual.  Oh yea... They are NOT dog friendly. ;-)",

    "text": "This place kinda deserves two stars but  it was clean and had a coolish atmosphere despite subpar food and awful service.  These were the worst fried oysters and fried pickles I've ever had in my life, and those are my go to bar bites so I've had plenty! Everything came in an awful soggy cornmeal coating which fell off when you tried to pick it up. Burger came out over temp, and the only thing on the menu we really wanted (fried chicken) they claimed to be out of. Our waitress RAVED about the banana pudding so we ordered that and a cobbler. We took a few bites and left it. We left a lot of food untouched and our waitress never bothered to ask if something was wrong or if we were dissatisfied. My boyfriend wasted a ton of money on this check, absolutely nothing was worth what we paid aside from my absolutely delicious drink which I believe was a peach Collins. Seriously the owners should hire a new chef and give their bartender a raise, they're the one keeping this place afloat!",

    "text": "I was first introduced to southern bbq food here in Charlotte, North Carolina. My boyfriend and I didn't know where to eat after our ballet show, so a bouncer outside guarding the escalators across the street suggested we tried this place.   At city smoke I ordered the beef brisket and it came with two sides: the slaw and the jalapeno cheddar corn bread! The brisket was delicious and must of been roasting for hours, for it just melted in my mouth good. However the corn bread was just okay, I wish it was warmed up for me. The cole slaw wasn't as what I am used to being from up north.   My boyfriend for the half slab sampler, so he got a taste of the ribs in the different sauces that they offered. Out of the three ribs he liked the Memphis ribs the best.   They have a good selection of beer and being in a town like Charlotte I had to have a beer to go with my bbq!",

    "text": "I'm not sure just how qualified I am to judge a BBQ place in Charlotte, being from Seattle myself, but I was reasonably impressed by what City Smoke had to offer.  For starters, their drink menu was pretty impressive, tons of bourbons and some specialty mixed drinks.  I had the Magic Bulleit, which was composed of Bulleit Bourbon (surprise!), ginger, simple syrup, and a splash of soda.  The drink was really good, though a bit under-mixed for my taste (aka, 1-oz shot, not 1-1/2 oz).  Looking over the menu, I really couldn't make up my mind, so I was extremely happy to see the $26 combo plate that they have - pulled pork, brisket, all three types of ribs (Memphis, Kansas City, and Texas - more of that in a moment), and two sides.  I'll be damned if I wasn't going to give that one a try.  So I did...and the behemoth arrived after a short wait.  Here are my findings: 1. Pulled Pork - A-MAZ-ING...perfectly tender, perfect light smoke flavor, and when tossed in a combination of their vinegar BBQ sauce plus their Kansas City sauce, utterly delectable.  2. Brisket - A bit of a miss here for me.  I loves my brisket, and they served up a decent version.  Very nice smoke ring, excellent balance of beef and smoke flavor, but it was really, REALLY dry - almost like they'd sliced it an hour or so before and left it warming.  It was good, but nothing to rave about -- it's also the only part of the meal I didn't finish (well, fries don't count).  3) Ribs - Each set had their own unique flavor, but it seemed mostly from the sauce (or lack thereof) rather than a unique preparation of each.  My biggest recommendation is to go fully-sauced or naked - either Kansas City smothered or Texas dry rub.  The Memphis was something a little bit in-between, and suffered for it.  My favorite by far were the Texas dry ribs, but even they were a little over-cooked and more blackened than I typically like my ribs.  The Kansas City were decently sauced, though I still added a little more to it.  The Memphis really needed something to stand out from the other two, and kind of missed the mark there.  Overall, good ribs, but not outstanding.  4) Sides - I went with the Lexington Slaw, which was diced cabbage mixed in a vinegar sauce, and their City Smoke Dusted Fries.  The slaw was second only to the pork in sheer BBQ bliss - the balance of the vinegar sauce with the cabbage was absolutely amazing.  The fries were pretty good, but...well, they were fries.  Overall, I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, but I wasn't as wowed as I really hoped I would be.",

We had wings, tater tots,,,which come with some amazing sauce.  Can I have the recipe??  We also had the deviled eggs and a cheese dip.  We loved the wings, so tasty.  They were charred and just perfectly cooked, we also loved the sauce it came with!  The only issue I had was the seasonal beer on the menu was listed at $4.5 but once we got the bill it was $8 per....my boyfriend had 4!  Other than the wrong price being advertised we had a great experience.  If we come back to Charlotte we will definitely stop in!",

The mac & cheese wasn't cheesy & creamy enough for my liking and the fries had a bit too much seasoning.    I think I'll stick to Queen City Q when I'm looking for BBQ uptown.",

Bar and restaurant with an open kitchen. Staff was very friendly and helpful with menu selections. One odd thing I found was they didnt have Carolina BBQ.  They had Kansas, Texas, etc but no Carolina.   I started with the fried pickles and LOVED them! I did not like the accompanying sauce as it was very mayonnaise based/flavored (so was their ranch). I then had the pulled pork with mac n cheese and some tomato bean side. The mac was yummy. The pork was average. The sauces available just didnt taste good to me or my coworker. The beans were not good.   We had a flight of beer at a great price. And the beers available here are great! Lots of craft beers, IPAs, pale ales, etc. My favorite was the Jalepeno beer (not spicy - just tasty).   Definitely come for beer and fried pickles! The rest...cant say its super great.",

    "text": "Three of my girlfriends and I went to City Smoke on Feb 24th for her birthday dinner. We arrived and wanted to have a table for 4, we were told that it would be about a 40 minute wait. We waited, and waited and waited some more. Eventually we made it in for dinner.  initially I was frustrated as Dan (the manager) was frustrated with his hostess and with how crowded the restaurant was. He went off on her at the door, about customers sneaking in alcohol. There was some type of pub crawl going on in Charlotte near the Epicenter and it was a madhouse.  We finally got invited in and we got to sit at the bar until our table was ready. I ordered the Raspberry-Peach Margarita. Before I could drink it our table was ready. Needless to say, when it arrived  it was amazing with fresh raspberries and peaches. It was just what I needed to calm my frazzled nerves.   We ordered the following appetizers: House Made Hummus- the olives, pita bread, olive oil and pickled onions were amazing. We literally had to stop ourselves from licking the bowl. It was amazing. Deviled Eggs- We ordered four and only ate two. They were kinda blah... Nothing to write home about. Rotisserie Chicken Wings- These were amazing. that spice rub is to die for.  Oysters on the half shell- We got them roasted. They were great.  Entrees ordered: Half Rotisserie Chicken-  Ohhhh my heavenly lord above. This chicken was slap your momma good. moist and flavorful, salty, crispety, crunchety, skin with that garlic aioli. It was the best smoked rotisserie chicken I have ever had. I have been telling anyone who will listen about  it, how good it was. I'm thinking about coming back to try that again. My Lord. I had the Hand Cut Fries and Mac and Cheese and the Collard Greens. I guess I'm a Collard Greens snob, they didn't taste like momma's. They were just okay. The hand cut fries were perfectly crispy and potato-y. Very enjoyable. The Mac and Cheese was decent.   Lonestar Beef Brisket- it wasn't as good as the chicken. It was okay. Nothing spectacular about it. The Brussel Sprouts were fantastic.  Also our server Frank couldn't have been nicer. He was a nice, efficient and attentive server. Give that man a raise.",

I ordered a Coke, which he brings me a can of soda and a short glass of ice.... for $2.50 by the way.  No refills!  There's a bar right across from us and you mean to tell me there are no fountains for soda?? As long as the food had taken, you would assume it would be fresh upon arrival...NOT! Everyone's house cut fries were old!  The aioli was more like plain mayonnaise. Yuck! I think it's safe to say this was a lesson learned.",

Pros:  upscale, trendy, nice decor, good spot downtown (or uptown as they say here) across from Omni hotel, serves flights of various types of alcohol with cute names and the Brussels sprouts were edible, roasted chicken was not dry. Cotton cake was super light like angel food cake with a surprisingly flavor of lavender and honey; local brew with jalapenos flavor is a hit for those who like spice; staff was very friendly and attentive; open view of kitchen, three sauce choices - KC which was more traditional with a kick, vinegar with spices you have to shake up and something that may remind you of Heinz 57. Brisket was good but comes out cut like prime rib not shaved.   Cons:  pulled pork is in a vinegar broth - no not a sauce basically vinegar; lamb sandwich was a flatbread with small pieces of lamb hidden amongst a mix of red onions, French fries, tomatoes and lettuce; creamy coleslaw - not so creamy - or flavored;  eggplant side dish was more tomatoes and onions with wisps of eggplant and because of the acoustics, even when not packed, the convos carry easily and swiftly across the restaurant. And at 6:30 on a weeknight they were out of the most coveted side dish - squash!  Bottom line:  Go for the drinks not the food.",

I asked about this and they noted because they are apart if a bigger building that has public bathrooms the same law doesn't apply. So the night I went to dine here  I waited 15 minutes in line to use their restroom or I had the option of going up the escalator and walking through someone's wedding to pee.

    "text": "This place has so much potential. We are visiting Charlotte and came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The staff all seems brand new. We waited for a good five minutes for a hostess to even come help us. Our server Michelle was very nice and super friendly. None of the other staff had a smile at any point - they all seemed like they hated being there. They were out of chicken which is their specialty dish so we ordered the sampler with two sides. The pulled pork was really good. The brisket was burnt and very dry. The toast was also burnt. Ribs were good nothing special though. The vinegar based bbq sauce (if you can classify it as a sauce) was weird. The sides we got were the rotisserie potatoes and mac'n'cheese which were both mediocre. Some of the potatoes were not fully cooked. Mac was pretty bland. Overall, we would not go back.",

Saturday night they took a big party reservation through greed and spent the rest of the time suffering through stress, explaining that delays and canceled reservations was because they had a large party, even had to print more menus. Made a reservation on open table that was confirmed that they subsequently canceled not that I saw the email. We offered to sit at the bar even though we were celebrating our anniversary written on the reservation they canceled. Manger thought that would be great! Offered to give us a whopping 10% off just before we were about to leave as an after thought. I had the server reverse it. Food was average and luke warm at best. Bar staff were great but frazelled. Hope you have a better experience if you choose to go.",

    "text": "I met some friends here for dinner and drinks, finding the place is a little tricky especially if you don't make frequent trips Uptown.   They offer valet but I'd suggest just parking I the BoA parking garage and taking the elevator down to the restaurant. The atmosphere is fine, nothing fancy but you should expect it from a BBQ joint. The place wasn't busy so we were seated right away.   The menu is not very extensive, but includes all the classics : ribs, pulled pork and brisket just to name a few items. For starters we ended up ordering some wings. It's not a bad deal for just $5 you get half a dozen wings with blue cheese and some other dipping sauce. The wings were very tasty! The came out hot and packed with flavor.   For my meal I went with the pulled pork sandwich and cheese grits. Meh, it was okay. I've had better pulled pork at other BBQ places and they didn't really give a lot of meat on the sandwich....more bun than meat is no bueno!!! The cheese grits were decent...but again nothing to write home about. If I came back I'd stick with the wings.   So why the low score??? Aside from the average food the waitress/bartender had a horrible attitude. I've said this before and I'll say it again....if customer service is NOT your thing....please do us all a favor and pick another job!!! Shitty service ruins the experience and meal every time! Even if the food had been better I'd have to strongly consider give my money to someone who rolls their eyes at me and my guests AND ignores my requests while I'm eating (excuse me for needing a refill on my drinks and extra napkins....ugh!).   So try this place at your own risk...or just grab some wings to go!",

I ordered the dry ribs, and was very discouraged to see my ribs come out with approximately 1/8th inch dry rub on top of them that was clearly put on immediately prior to them leaving the kitchen. I picked them up and held them sideways and the rub just poured off in one large dry pile.  I asked to speak to the manager and instead the chef came out and explained that was how they made them at City Smoke - - \"additional\" dry rub is put on immediately prior to serving.  I say additional because he also explained that prior to cooking any of the ribs, dry rub was put on them (what I am used to), but for any \"dry\" order even more was put on just before it left the kitchen.  He was very polite about it.  I am not sure if there was a manager present, but despite the fact that was who I asked to speak to, he or she never came to my table.  There were only three or four other tables being served at this time so I know it is not because they were too busy.  I ended up scraping off as much of the additional rub as I could onto my plate with a spoon because when biting into the ribs all I could taste was a mouthful of the spices.",

The bartender was so inattentive and not friendly at all... we almost had to flag her down anytime we needed anything. Considering there were 3 other people in the entire restaurant, it was quite annoying. I ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich with mac and cheese. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. However, the sauce for the sandwich was pretty good. Everything on the menu was also fairly expensive. Our bill was around $50 for 2 entrees, 2 beers, and 1 mixed drink. City Smoke was definitely a poor choice considering the amount of restaurants in the area...Unless you like overpriced, mediocre BBQ.",

I must have just come in a good day because we loved everything.  Mac and cheese yummy and soft.  Not creamy like out of the box, seemed a little like custard which surprised me coming from a bbq place, so good!  The side of Brunswick Stew was also very good, meaty and comforting.  I had the brisket which was much better than the last place we went and my girlfriend had the pulled pork, which she couldn't stop taking about.  Upon our servers advice we got the pecan pie for dessert. Wow. Completely made from scratch and you can tell.  It makes it seem like I've never actually had pecan pie before now.  Again, maybe we just got really lucky, I'm not sure what some people didn't like, but we will definitely be back.",

For $10.83 I got iced tea, two vegetable sides, a piece of bread and a piece of chicken that wasn't enough to feed my dog (no bones for Fido of course).  I called back to talk to them and was told that \"1/4 chicken dark meat is a small leg and HALF of a small thigh\" - which is what I got.  They did offer to fix me something else, but I didn't want anything else.  I wanted a chicken meal equal to what I paid for it.  My friend got the same thing, but with white meat and was disappointed as well (a tiny wing and half a little breast).  Will not be going back.  The chicken and collards were pretty good, so I'm giving them two stars, but the value was not.  I know $10 is not a lot of money, but this wasn't a $10 lunch.",

The bartender that served us (who was quite rude and obviously hates her life, her job and would have rather been watching the game than waiting on us) assured us that the chili chips were a large portion and plenty for two people. Ha! There were 12 chips covered with what tasted like Hormel chili. Horrible. We couldn't finish them, but that had absolutely nothing to do with the tiny, overpriced portion size. As far as the BBQ goes.. We had the pulled pork. Being born and raised in NC, I've had a lot of BBQ in my lifetime. This was by far the worst I've ever had. Flavorless, greasy, fatty, just plain bad. The sauces sucked and the sides were nothing to write home about either. My advice? Just drive the 3 miles to Mac's!",

Dinner right at 5, close to the hotel sounded just right.  We were trying to avoid chain restaurants, and with the exception of breakfast, Uptown Charlotte makes it an easy thing to do, outside of Epicentre across the street.  Being so early for dinner, we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  Hubby and I each had a beer, light for him, dark for me.  We went with the waiter's suggestion on both and he did good.  We both had beers new to us and were both happy with them.  (Mine was the Duck Rabbit Milk Stout- good stuff!)   The waiter was very friendly and good with the kids.  He made some suggestions and answered questions about options for the kids, since there were no kids' menus.  (They must usually be on the placemats, because he said they had \"run out\" of kids' menus.)  Once they heard mac and cheese the kids were taken care of, on top of all the peanuts.  I had a cheeseburger with fried pickles and comeback sauce and fries.  The fries were good, the burger was ok.  I'd like to say I liked it better, but the meat wasn't very flavorful, (despite being ground chuck and house ground brisket as the menu says.)  The sauce was a little overpowering.  Couldn't even taste the fried pickles, which were the reason I picked it.  Not bad, but not great.  Hubby had a pulled pork sandwich which he said was really good.  He liked the choice of the sauces on the table.  Vinegar style, KC style spicy and City Smoke sweet.  The mac and cheese the kids had was really good.  (Thankfully not Kraft style, which we had been given all vacation!)  The kids weren't crazy about the crispy cheese crust on the top, but were happy to share that part with me! Overall, I'd definitely stop in here again.  They seemed to be trying hard, I'd just order something else.  I liked that we were made welcome, even towing a couple littles along with us.",

There was no 'hot' sauce, though, for those who like the red hot version. --Mac&cheese - I agree with previous comments.  It was OK, but too velveeta-y. --Cheese grits - fabulous.  Like dessert, almost, due to (I'm sure) the amount of butter. --Fried okra - good.  Sprinkled with a spice with a bit of a kick to it, so it had a nice flavor. --Meal served with texas toast.  In my opinion, that's just a waste of time and food; can't imagine how much of that stuff they throw out.  A BBQ plate should be served with cornbread.  In fact, cornbread should be a freebie for the table. --I appreciate that soft drinks are served in a small bottle with a cup of ice - it's better flavor than a fountain drink; however, I missed the free refills.  Our waiter did explain that an additional drink would cost us and offered to bring water instead.  Service was good. It's not like there's a plethora of good BBQ joints in this town (ironically), so until I try Queen City for comparison, I'd call this a nice place to grab lunch.",

As we are unfamiliar with downtoun we wandered past the local restaurants, we happened to see the craftbeer chalk board, the variety was very interesting, so we decided to see what it was all about. When we walked in we were greeted by a smiling, bubbly hostess. As we looked over the menu, our waiter came by and asked what we'd like to drink, he recommended Allagash which is a bourbon infused beer so we figured WOW \"best of both worlds\"! We then asked what his favorite thing on the menu was? He asked how hungry are you, we said we were looking to split something and the Cue combo was suggested; which consisted of Brisket, Pulled Pork, 3 kinds of ribs including Kansas City, Memphis, & Texas Dry Rub and if that wasn't enough it came with 2 sides!!! The Mac & Cheese was AMAZING and the Jalepeno, Chedder Corn Bread had a surprisingly good flavor!!! After we ate half of everything in front of us we wondered if we'd even make it to the Blumenthal show! LOL!! Overall we had an amazing experience and we will definitely be back when we have more time to spend... Thank you City Smoke!!!",

The collard greens were EXCELLENT. Tasted just like my grandmas however, the macaroni was subpar at best. My brisket was slightly tough and hubbies ribs were pretty average. Kind of dry like the macaroni. Texas Toast was pretty good as well. We also ordered drinks. The Arnold Palmer and the margarita, both were good. The bbq sauce was good as well. Overall, the food was decent and it came out very fast. I don't think this is a place that we'll be frequenting. It was just ok. Like, we could have made it at home honestly.",

As my side I had the mac and cheese and boy was it cheesy and delicious! I ordered a drink from the bar and it was not watered down and gave me the perfect effect of relaxation you would expect from a well mixed drink.   Our waiter was very attentive even though we came on a busy Friday night. He was able to accommodate all of our request for what we asked for in a timely fashion.",

The downside of this restaurant is that there is only 1 shared bathroom for men and women. It's located perfectly downtown and close to the Performing Arts Center. The service was decent for a busy Saturday night. They have a fun whisky flight menu if that's your style. The BBQ was decent, probably not the best in the state, but enjoyable for the night. The Mac & cheese is homemade and an essential side for your plate. The plates were a better deal as we wanted to try a multitude of sides. We came with a group of people and we all ate Smorgasbord-style.",

    "text": "Selected City Smoke for restaurant week.  Happened to go on a Monday, which also happened to be a federal holiday.  Arrived about 5:30, not a lot of customers so was seated pretty quickly. Server was friendly and ready to answer any questions. My selections were as follows;  Starter: grilled wings (dry rub) Entree: pulled pork w/collard greens, mac&cheese Dessert: cheesecake w/chocolate drizzle (minus pistachios)  The wings had a great flavor and were tender.  The pulled pork was plentiful but the texture was very mushy, like it had been stirred continuously.  With some tomato based barbecue sauce on top, I was able to eat quite a bit. The collard greens were extremely salty and I could only stand about 2 bites. The Mac & Cheese was decent and I practically ate all of it.  There was a piece of what I'm going to assume was similar to Texas toast done on the grill.  It had black char marks rather than a golden brown color.  The cheesecake was cheesecake cake.  Nothing fancy.  The manager did come around and did offer another item when informed about the saltiness of the collards.  I declined.   Not a horrible experience but most likely will not add them to my rotation.",

The City Center Marriott is nice, as is the restaurant inside, but nothing caught my eye there.   Perhaps my Yelp settings were wrong, but City Smoke didn't show up on the first page. After reviewing a few places, I decided just to walk out and see what I find.   City Smoke is just down from the hotel on S. College.   At 10pm, I had the pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese. They serve Carolina and KC BBQ sauce on the side. At this hour, I was expecting it to be dried out but it was perfect. Both sauces were very good.   The bartender was out of Buffalo Trace and made a good recommendation.   Prices for both food and drink were good for this location. Their prices, quality, service make it a great place to go!",

We saw this spot and checked the yelp reviews... they weren't great but we wanted to check it out for ourselves.   We sat at the bar and had awesome service. Nice, attentive, knowledgeable and visibly working hard. I ordered the fruity margarita and it was pretty good, nothing wrong with it but I generally don't do sweet... my own fault. My husband ordered the flight of bourbon... good choice. He LOVED them, was really happy with the quality.   Food- we ordered two apps to share and that's it. We ordered the Sticky Ribs and Potatoes. Um I am still thinking about those sticky ribs. They were absolutely my favorite.. I almost liked the bowl. The flavors were spot on to my taste buds. Potatoes were also on point. They also served some complimentary bread with a special spread.... I never wanted the basket to end :)   Decor was cute and current. Bathroom was a single and there was only one. It was clean though so I'm not that mad.   We would do date night here anytime! We can't wait to try the dinner!",

On the way back to the rental truck we saw City Smoke. So, instead of driving to Haymaker 10 minutes we check the list again and City Smoke was next on the list. Compromise not really, right place right time more like it. This place has great BBQ and insanely delicious sides especially the vegetable variety.  I ordered the quarter rotisserie chicken, small portion and the two sides. Brussels Sprouts crazy good, Acorn squash step back and check yourself. Chill vibe, modern decor professional service and a cold brew to boot. Downtown is a better place with City Smoke around. Enjoy.",

Our chicken was a bit dry. The soup delicious as well as  most of the sides . The coleslaw was fresh and brussel sprouts just a tad chewy  On the way to the single  restroom we saw spilled water on the floor with staff working  around it. . I mentioned something and it was cleaned up promptly with  a caution sign out up.  I would  definitely eat here again",

This place has a good beer selection and a nice list of bourbon specialty cocktails. As a bar alone, I would give it a higher rating. Nice atmosphere and huge bar area.  We started our meal out with the fried pickles, which were pretty good, but the shards of glass that I bit into in one of the pickle slices kind of ruined that. The staff reacted, comped my meal, etc. so I wasn't too upset, but it really did freak me out a bit to spit out a few pieces of glass after I just bit into a fried pickle.  But regardless of that event, my opinion of this spot wouldn't change. I would much prefer an NC barbecue restaurant to focus solely on NC barbecue and not try to be a mediocre version of Austin, Kansas City, and Memphis as well. The NC pulled pork was quite good, but the eastern vinegar sauce was horrible. I love Eastern NC style vinegar based sauce, but I don't know who came up with the vinegar crap I tasted there. No flavor at all. The Kansas City sauce resembled nothing like I have ever tasted in my 6 or 7 experiences in KC with their local style barbecue. It tasted like Ketchup when compared to Arthur Bryant's or Gates'. Their own \"city smoke\" sauce was decent and tangy, but nothing to write home about.  On a really positive note, the Brunswick Stew was killer. Probably some of the best I have ever had. It had a nice spicy bite to it and had a bunch of chunks of pulled pork. I could just order a giant bowl of this and I'd be happy!  As uptown barbecue restaurants go, I think Queen City Q has this place beat by a long shot. Unless I just want to grab a beer or a bourbon drink, I don't think I will revisit this place.",

    "text": "I work downtown; been here two or three times for lunch.  Pork BBQ - Their's is good.  Good flavor, several sauces available, and the portions (at least on the Plate) are fine (not heaping, but fine).   I've had the Brunswick Stew.  Okay, so simply based upon my experience and input from friends, Brunswick stew is usually thick and not soupy.  The stew is soupy here - i.e. it has a lot of broth.  But, get this now... I've ordered it twice because it's good.  So it may not look like what you're expecting when you get it, but give it a try.  Collard greens were good.  There seems to be a lot of stems, but then, not everybody  makes the effort to pull some out.  Good flavor!  All in all, this is a convenient spot for good BBQ in the center of downtown Charlotte.  Fortunately for us here in the queen city, we now have two options available!!  If you do go, get the deviled eggs appetizer.  They are good!  One thing to note... if you order a soft drink, you're buying a bottle.  That's it.  So your refills are limited to your bottle.  Want more? Buy another.  I don't care for this approach.  The wait staff was very nice, friendly and informative.  Not terribly attentive, but then they don't have to do refills either. ;-)  So, I like this place and will most likely be back.",

The obvious clue should have been how empty they were on a Sat night.  Keep walking when you see this place, no wait, RUN!  Cold buns, cold wings, cold BBQ, but I will admit the baked beans were hot and decent, but watery... How do you stay open when you don't cook food to the right temp, I'm pretty sure they are microwaving left-overs! Service was aweful, didn't refill our drinks at all while we were there for an hour, no knowledge of the menu!  Take it from someone who eats Lexington BBQ a few times a month.... This place sucks all around and I hope they go out of business, then maybe someone who knows how to cook can move into this corner I go by numerous times a weekend. It's insulting they would even try to sell what prepare or actually don't.",

It took over an hour for the first 2 out of the 6 beers to arrive.  When the food came almost 90 minutes after ordering the orders were all wrong and it was cold.  We asked for a manger several times from our waitress as well as other staff.  Our request was in a respectful demeanor and we didn't talk down to anyone.  The manager never came.  I also wrote a note through the website several weeks ago (this was the night Pearl Jam was in town) and they never responded.  It's one thing to have a bad night with a sub par waitress but its clearly not an off night when the manager hides from a circumstance like this and won't respond.",

They serve the food to you on what look to be those metal dissection treys you had in biology class. Some brilliant restaurant executive who never ate BBQ in his life thought it would be a good idea to put thin paper down on the trays to keep your food off the cheap metal tray...well when you but BBQ sauce on thin paper it falls apart. The result is you end up picking up pieces of the wet paper when your eat your food. Do yourself a favor and skip this pretentious joke of a BBQ joint.  The best part of the experience is that if you order a soda with your meal they bring you a bottled soda when they give you the check at the end and don't tell you that you have to pay for it. They just set it on the table and say nothing as if they are just giving it to you. Intentional or not it was misleading and sketchy.",

    "text": "First time in Charlotte i decided to try this place since it was near my hotel..Good beer selection; didn't recognize the names but they all looked cool (interesting names) and pretty inexpensively priced. The waitress was really helpful with selecting beer and food options. She said the fried oysters were popular. I love me some oysters but I usually eat them raw and these were breaded and fried which took some getting use to. I really wasn't too impressed; I had to put hot sauce on it to be able to eat it! It was just a weird combo of mush and the fried breading so I couldn't eat it. I can't tell if it was how it was made or if it's just me. I wanted to try the pulled pork and ribs but there was no combo for it but she let me order the ribs and a side of pulled pork. They had a good selection of sides but she suggested the mac and cheese and fried okra so I went with it...the okra was surprisingly good and the Mac and cheese was disappointing. The crunchy topping on the mac and cheese makes it good but the cheese was really weird. I was really sad about the pulled pork; I imagine meat that is soft and shreds easily and that was not the case. I got large clumps of pork that wasn't soft at all, was hard to pull apart and had ok taste. The ribs made up for it though! I tried all 3 kinds and the menu really describes them well! The ribs had good flavor and the BBQ sauces they serve is really good! Meal comes with Texas toast which is good too. All in all it was a good meal but I would only come back for the beer and ribs (if I'm ever back in Charlotte that is).",

The waiter made a big deal of telling us that the ribs were all St. Louis cut ribs regardless of style. SL cut ribs are larger and meatier. What we got were  short puny ribs with little meat on them, the size of baby backs. They tasted ok but nothing special. When we pointed out they were not the size he had stated, he had no explanation for it. The pulled pork was decent, the brisket was very tough. We had 3 sides-fries, collard greens and creamy grits which were good.    The waiter was apologetic, offered us some kind of card to come back to get a free sandwich, but I honestly don't see myself returning there anytime soon. Midwood Smokehouse does BBQ much better, IMHO",

While they were very tasty, we ended up waiting 30 mins because our waitress forgot to ring them in. We were a little upset about this as we couldn't get the manager over to our table to tell her about it because she was very rarely in sight.

Who doesn't like an old-fashioned with Blanton's bourbon? Exactly...no one.   My meal was above average--1/4 white, mac and collards. I enjoyed the smoked flavor of the collards.

    "text": "Be prepared to switch your choices during queens fest cause they ran out of a lot of the good choices early in the night!!!  City Smoke sent me an email prior to restaurant week that peaked my interest so I saved it. The email was  advertising a chicken dinner for 2 during restaurant week. It sounded like a great idea after my other restaurant week plans for that night fell thru. So I quickly made a reservation through open table. However once we sat down for our dinner that night I was presented with a Queens Fest menu that boasted most of their menu items for a $30 price. You could pick an appetizer, entree and dessert but  the dinner from the email was no where to be found. The Queens fest deal allowed us to try a lot of their menu items so we opted for that and never even asked about the email deal.  Sad thing was that once we started ordering a few of the better choices on the menu they had ran out of. We were able to wait for them to get more of the smoked wings but we weren't able to try the sticky ribs or the other ribs on the combo platter.  I was really bummed.   I did really enjoy the lamb flatbread and the brisket. The grits, Mac and cheese and the roasted cauliflower were also great side item choices.   One other sour note for the night is they charge for extra sauce!!! Y'all know that's my pet peeve. We must of ordered one too many ranches cause we got a nice 1.30 charge for 2 RANCHES. But we ordered 2 orders of kids chicken tenders with fries and 3 orders of the smoked wings so idk when we got out of hand with sauce but we did according to them.   Overall I'm not so sure I would return to City Smoke. It took a really long time for our food to come out (we had school age kids with us and they started to fall asleep) and I was really disappointed by missing out on the ribs. Granted I know restaurant week is a very busy time but we have an early reservation on a Monday.   City Smoke  100 N Tryon St Charlotte, NC 28202 Monday January 21, 2018 7:30pm",

    "text": "Good stuff! The semi casual atmosphere and the impressive flavors offered here are a reason to return again and again.   We tried City Smoke for restaurant week and boy... we couldn't have been happier. The interior is a really nice mix of farmhouse modern with an awesome open kitchen (open kitchens are a clear sign of the cleanliness in my books).    We started with the bread and butter. The kalamata whipped butter was full of flavor and really a step up from the average bread and butter. The bread was fresh and soft, a nice vessel for the butter.   Next we're appetizers, we had rotisserie chicken wings and the Mediterranean flatbread. The flatbread was a fresh flavor with a high quality olive oil. The wings.... the wings were off the charts. The dry rub was so good the dipping sauces were not needed and the grill marks add a nice color and an extra layer of flavor.   Main course we had the bbq combo and the filet kabob. The combo was huge!! It's enough for two people so be ready to take some home or just split it there. Pulled pork had a nice vinegar sauce, brisket was lean and moist, and the ribs were fun with the two style on the same rack. Sides were also really good. The kabob was a perfect medium well and a might lighter entree which was nice considering how heavy the BBQ is. We managed to finish the kabob entree and almost half the combo and too the rest Home.  Dessert finished the restaurant week meal but we ordered it to go after everything else. Cheesecake and tres leches were also a good size and had good flavor. The cheesecake topping was a really nice addition and the tres leches had a vibrant lemon flavor from the zest added on top.",

I filled out the catering form last week to prepare for an event for about 20 executives as one of the executives specifically requested this place. Gave it a couple days and never heard back.  I dialed the number on their website which after a couple of rings went to their catering voicemail.  Left a voicemail stating I had filled out the form and would like a response back to my request or a call back to discuss options.  As of today, a week later, I have never heard a response back from either the form or the call.  It will be no surprise that we gave up and went with another restaurant in uptown.",

On my most recent visit, I met my husband and a friend for lunch kinda begrudgingly. But, I was so pleasantly surprised, I had to come back and update the review. Service was attentive and the food was delish! I had a veggie plate with cauliflower, acorn squash, brussel sprouts, and grits -- each was perfect.   Next time we're looking for an uptown dinner spot before a show at Booth or Belk, we'll definitely consider City Smoke! Hopefully, their beer has improved as much as the food and service.",

Here are a few things to note: - One of my colleagues liked the chance to get a flight of Bourbon flights.  I'm not into the hard stuff and just wanted a beer.  For a BBQ place, I thought the selection of beers on tap was a bit limited, and it was especially hard to find a broad range of local brew options. - I originally was hungry for ribs and was going to get just that, but I decided to select the 'Cue Combo instead...I'm sure glad I did!  The brisket was absolutely the best, while the ribs and pulled pork were pretty ordinary.  I liked the sauce that came on the side.  And, I ordered the collards and mac n cheese sides.  They were both good, but the portion sizes (in a little up) were a little small I thought (not even at the top). - One colleague ordered only the brisket and was pretty happy; another ordered the trout and thought it was ok (but no accolades). - Atmosphere was OK, but I would have liked a booth instead of a table but there didn't appear to be that many of those.  Service was good, but the waitress didn't seem to know how to check in without interrupting.  Bottom line:  It worked for dinner, but looking back on it I wished I had selected some other place.",

Grabbed a quick weeknight dinner with the bf, decided to try City Smoke since it's only a couple block walk. Looked like a great menu for a meaty bbq mood, and the drink menu had delicious options for any lush. Unfortunately reading about the food was the best part. I ordered the brisket with Mac n cheese and fries for the sides, bf ordered the combo with coleslaw and potatoes. Brisket was the fattiest I've ever encountered, mac n cheese looks like it's sat in a cafeteria tray all day and was scooped out. Everything was lack luster and just not good. Server was very pleasant and drinks fairly tasty but eating is cool too and didn't provide the foodgasm I was craving. I doubt it'll be the worst food you ever eat but, do yourself a favor and go a block or two any direction and dine somewhere else.",

Pretty decent choices. I personally didn't care for any of the desserts but hey.  3.5 stars on their drink menu and prices.   2 stars on the prices for those SMOKING GOOD SMOKED wings.  1 star for that red chimichurri sauce that's served with the jumbo shrimp appetizer.   5 stars for an actual cloth instead of paper napkins.   Things appeared quite clean. Astethic to the eye.  Decent location.  Nice cut and I forgot to ask for center cut.  Only had 2 kinds of ribs. I recalled seeing a 3rd but I guess it wasn't part of restaurant week.   I will return.  They can keep that mac & cheese. A lot of places around here seem to offer macaroni and cheese but fail to make a nice, juicy, cheesy option. Always dry and light on the cheese. Idk what's that about.   I wanted to try the collard greens and Brussel sprouts but it was one of those days so fries won. I also wanted to try the salmon but brisket won. I look forward to the next trip. Many more options to try.   Oh the pulled pork is a vinegar based cooked item.",

The guy seemed like he was just having a bad day - he was short when asked questions, our drink refills came with our check, etc. I'm pretty sure he didn't crack a smile the whole afternoon.   I would have liked to come back to check out the happy hour scene since their bar looked really impressive but I will pass on that.

In short, while this may be a decent restaurant, I wouldn't really call it a BBQ joint.  Highlights: Sauce and seasoning pairings on the ribs are spot on!   Good slaw (vinegar-based) and potato salad (mayo/cream based). Friendly service.  Needs improvement: Price point is a bit high for what you get. Would prefer spare ribs over loin backs (or at least offer the option). Location of the restaurant does not allow for True smoking of the meat.  Other info to know: The address states 100 N. Tryon, but the entrance is located at the corner of Trade and College.",

The fries were really good - slightly sweet and otherwise perfectly seasoned. The Jalapeno corn bread was superb. The reason that I gave them 4 stars instead of 3 was the price/value ratio, and the fact that they had about 12 craft beers on tap.",

The pulled pork was AMAZING and we both loved the different BBQ flavors. I would suggest not ordering the mac n' cheese, it was very bland and came out cold...didn't do a True BBQ restaurant justice.  The hardest part for me to deal with during lunch was watching them slide the sides under the heat lamp and my bowl of collards dump out onto the countertop and then get scooped back into the bowl and sent to my table. I'm sure it's clean up there and the guy washed his hands, but it kind of grossed me out.   All in all everything was OK, but not over the top great. I might go back, but will probably order different sides.",

On a Friday night we didn't have to wait to get a table which was appreciated but a little odd considering how busy most restaurants can get on the weekends. Regardless, our waitress (should have asked her name) was super friendly and conversational.   To start, I had a margarita (didn't really warrant the $8.50 price tag - it was good but it had a \"watered down\" taste). I ordered a \"pulled chicken\" sandwich with fries and added a side of mac n' cheese based on a recommendation from the waitress. The fries were good but nothing out of the ordinary. The sandwich was fantastic. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had a nice smokey taste. The sauce that was served with it was a great compliment to the sandwich and the fries, too! It was easy to eat and the sandwich stayed intact for the most part.  The mac n' cheese side was a small portion but tasted amazing. It was creamy and had a rich flavor of a few different cheeses. I really enjoyed it.   Overall, the ambiance was warm, the service was fast and friendly and the price tag wasn't unbearable. I had a bill of $20 before the tip which seemed reasonable for the amount of food and the alcohol that I had ordered.  I'll definitely give it a thumbs up and solid 4 star review. I will be back to try the actual BBQ next time. Didn't give it a full 5 because it wasn't really out of the ordinary and there wasn't an \"experience\", it was just a great meal.",

Should have looked for the dark, local hole in the wall type to get good downhome BBQ.  I decided to try the combo, since I could not decide what to get.  The best things on the platter were the cornbread and collard greens, even the mac n cheese was eh!  Brisket - dry, ribs - dry, pulled port - eh.   The best thing was when I ordered an Arnold Palmer - order it all the time and have gotten a lemonade/iced tea combo 100% of the time - except this one.  First impression was \"wow, they are really cheap with their drinks\" - came in a small, similar to lowball sized glass.  Didn't taste the alcohol but after a bit was feeling a little weird, but went ahead and finished the drink (also thought it was weird that I was given a refill) figuring I was just tired.  Then asked the waiter if there was alcohol in the drink and he looked at me like I was asking a crazy question, and finally said yes, and asked isn't that what I wanted.  No - the Arnold Palmer I was wanting was just plain old lemonade/iced tea.  So he starts laughing. No big deal - confusion but get this - he doesn't actually bring me what I wanted and charged me for a drink that I didn't actually order!  Really?  Good thing I wasn't a recovering alcoholic or allergic to alcohol.",

    "text": "Great after work bar - not so great BBQ.   For my meal I ordered the brisket with sides of collards and potato salad.   The brisket has the chewy/dry consistency of reheated meat. Also, there is no identifiable smoke ring, which is the hallmark of smoked meat. Whatever smokey taste I get is on the surface and appears to be smoke flavoring applied as part of a very light rub. Overall low on flavor. I am very disappointed - especially since the name of the place is \"Smoke.\" On the upside the \"brisket sauce\" is tasty and complements the brisket well, but mostly as hydration.   The collards have the familiar vinegary, sweet, hot taste that I like and has ham bits well incorporated for flavor. Overall a good side for those who enjoy collard greens.   The potato salad is forgettable. It appears to be some version of baked potato salad.  It contains celery, green onions, small chunks of red potatoes, a scant few bits of bacon, and is made creamy by what tastes like a mixture of sour cream and mayo. Some may enjoy it, but it was too creamy for me - I can barely taste any potato in the mix.   Overall an unimpressive experience, but since it is conveniently located - in the same building as where I work - and the beer selection is decent I will probably give another main dish and sides a try on a less motivated day.",

The only downside to the restaurant was the tables and how close they were placed together. I was afraid to get up to go pee because I was scared to knock something off a table or bump someone.

    "text": "I'll start this off with the admission that I am not the biggest NC BBQ fan. That is, what the natives of NC (specifically Charlotte) consider to be the best BBQ is far from what I consider it to be. Their favorite places are miles outside of town and serve from meat with their BBQ sauce.  I am not a native, so my preferences are a bit more unique.  The place has a great atmosphere, with their tapped beers scrawled over one of the walls in chalk which looks nice. They have a good selection. Their BBQ is not bad at all. Is it the best I've ever had? No. The best I've had did not come out of an a la cart restaurant - and I don't think it ever will. Compared to the competition in Charlotte I consider this to be a good choice though, certainly as good as Queen City a few blocks over.  My favorite item on the menu  however, is not BBQ at all. Their monstrous chicken wings are phenomenal. If I had to go watch the game somewhere Uptown, this would probably be my choice.",

Living in South Florida its a bit of a drive.    The staff was super friendly once we walked in we were seated immediately. Dan our server was great. I normally drink Corona and this place has no imports. So most waiters would of been like \"Yeah we don't have it\". Dan recommended a local beer which then offered me a free sample. It was good enough to enjoy dinner with it. Once our drinks came out ( super quick by the way ) our orders were taken. We had our kids with us on this visit, so I was a little surprised they have a kids menu but no kids menu printed. It was a little odd but Dan have us all our options. Food came out, and was awesome. I've had some really good BBQ, this wasn't the best but pretty good. The meat on our ribs were falling off the bone, well seasoned, and cooked well. The meat wasn't dry like some places serve.   Overall it was clean. One small bathroom to share with everyone which could be an issue if the place was super busy, a needs better lighting inside the bathroom.   Location was great. Just about 3-5 minute walk from our hotel.",

We walked into the restaurant and there were no other customers, empty, just staff. We proceed to sit at a high top table for 4 since another friend was on her way to join us. Menus were handed to us by the staff and then the manager came over and requested us to move since he had a reservation on the table at 615pm. Since we thought about having dinner we agreed to move to another table. I asked for a window table in the corner (just to people watch while we chatted) and he said sorry that one is taken as well. Remember the restaurant was EMPTY even the staff were embarrassed about this situation. Needless to say we left and had a great time at the Ritz and dinner was fabulous at BTL Steak. My advice if you have customers walking into an empty restaurant treat them with respect and kindness it goes along way and we are in the south for goodness sake.",

    "text": "When we arrived late into Charlotte on a long road trip from Toronto down to Florida we headed for one of my favorite downtown corners, Tryon and Trade. I'd been to City Smoke a few months ago and thought that the ambiance was amazing so we decided to have a return trip there. We sat at the bar so we could get a good view of the Charlotte Hornets game and we were looking forward to just kicking back with some appetizers and a couple of drinks. My hubby ordered a great blonde stout from Legal Remedy  and as the responsible designated driver I went with icy water LOL. I ordered my usual favorite, the brussel sprouts, but they missed the mark by a long shot last night. There was nothing special about them, the brussel sprouts were undercooked, and they were sitting in a puddle of uninspired balsamic vinegar that was neither reduced nor adding anything to the dish. My husband ordered a platter of ribs, even though he had said he would only get an appetizer LOL, and he ended up getting brisket served to him. Oops... But they did deliver the ribs a few minutes later and all in all the meat was just as it was a few months ago, beautiful looking on the plate, but not the best that we've ever had. I'd say if you want ribs or chicken to head over to Queen City Q just around the corner. Not as much of an upscale vibe but definitely better barbecue. All In All, City smoke is an amazing place to sit and watch life go by in Charlotte, if we would have had time I'd like to have tried all of the great whiskeys and drinks on their menu but it wasn't in the cards for this trip. Give it a try, and enjoy the view.",

We started with the shishito Keller which were great except we had to add plenty of salt, this becomes a trend.  The bread was good the garlic spread was a little strong so go light with it.  We shared the prime rib with side of tomatoes and beets. First it was disappointing they didn't ask us how we wanted the prime rib, it came medium so we were happy.  The cut was very tough, I had to spit out 2 pieces after trimming a large portion away.  The ahju was good but again we had to add salt tot he steak.   The tomatoes were no very good, it wasn't season but it my opinion they should have taken them off the menu than serve them as was.  My husband loved the beets.   Our friends ordered the pulled pork, which was super watery, prime rib sandwich which was good but again needed salt.  They did rave about the mac n cheese and the grits.   We did have the creme brulee and it was amazing.",

I would like to see a couple more options, but for what it is, I'd consider it again as a back up.  I sat at the bar and my bartender was very attentive, which helps the rating.

We had oysters and wings and everything was good.  Will definitely be back! This could be a regular place.  The rest of the menu was intriguing and I can't wait to try more!",

    "text": "Had high hopes for this place and I HATE writing negative reviews but we just were not impressed.   We had a large group and upon arriving were offered drinks. After 3 attempts at ordering a craft beer I thought I would like and being told they didn't have anything like what I was looking for (no stout? No Belgian type ale?) I switched to Jack and Coke. Then the server said they were out of Jack and Gentleman's Jack and my only option was single barrel at $15 a drink. So finally went with a specialty drink that tasted watered down. As I started looking at the menu I learned they are a whiskey bay with like 30 types of bourbon starting at like $4. And my only option was single barrel at $15?  Came time we to order food and our waiter was nowhere to be found. After a good 10 minutes he came by and I ordered the brisket with Mac n cheese and loaded potato. Brisket was ok, not great not terrible, mac n cheese was ok but I didn't feel it lived up to the other reviews. Potato was just bland.  I wanted to like it but just didn't have a great experience all around.  Will not be going back.",

    "text": "The food was excellent and the drinks were great. One my recent stay in Charlotte I saw this place in the corner from the Epic Center. It's a hard to get into since it is connected to the adjacent building. The tables are kind of close together so doesn't give too much privacy. I had the Duck Nachos as an appetizer they were very good. As the main course the Pulled pork with Mac and chews and collard greens. The Mac and cheese was good but those collard greens were amazing!",

    "text": "Best thing about this place is the staff.  The bartenders and servers are very knowledgeable about their food, sauces and alcohol.  I love the fact they have all NC draft beer on special on Mondays for $3.50 and served ICE COLD out of the glycerin taps!   One of their specialty drinks, the bacon infused bourbon bloody mary is AMAZING.  Definitely not your typical bloody mary made with vodka.  Just enough heat in this bloody mary and that trace of bacon flavor will make you want a second or even a third!  Lunch turnover is fast!  If you want an fabulous meal without having to get fast food, this is the place.  In and out in less than half hour!",
