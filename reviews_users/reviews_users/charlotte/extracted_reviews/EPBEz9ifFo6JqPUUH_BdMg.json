    "text": "Sometimes you just crave take-out.  Something hot and comforting while you sit in your pjs late at night.  Sometimes spicy, sometimes not.  I consider chinese/thai/indian takeout to be in it's own category of food options, similar to the way I consider grocery store sushi to be in it's own category compared to real restaurant sushi and the way frozen pizza is compared to freshly tossed pizza.  Sometimes you want the former, sometimes the latter.    Thai Thai fits the bill of the latter perfectly.  I've been a handful of times and have tried several vegetarian options of both noodles and rice.  I usually go with \"medium spicy\" as I find plain old \"spicy\" to be a little bland at times.    The price and portion sizes are great for sharing or having leftovers later.",

I've recommended this place to so many people....just thought it's high time I post a review and let everyone know!!  Note: on busy days (weekends) the wait time could go up to 40 mins (although the standard response when placing the order on the phone is always 20 mins :))",

Whether you're tired or just lazy, my guess is you're super hungry and don't want to waste time reading reviews. Here you go.  The food here looks good and smells good, but tastes bland.  We ordered panang curry and cashew stir fry, both with chicken. Both came with steamed jasmine rice, and we threw in some Thai iced teas to drink. When we opened up the bag, everything looked and smelled delicious. It wasn't.  Never in a million years would I expect Thai food to be bland. Maybe we didn't order it spicy enough, or maybe the food here just isn't that good. It's not bad, mind you, but it's not anywhere close to delicious. The chicken was kind of dry, the sauces way too mild and the veggies tasted like they came from a buffet line.  If I were you, I'd try to find some place else or just order a pizza. I really wanted to like this place; it's a shame I didn't.",

So, I don't know how their pad thai and see ew compare to any of its neighbors, but the dishes we did order from Thai Thai were pretty good. (and the portions were huge)  The Chili Duck we ordered with a 3 star (out of 5), and it had pretty good flavor. Some of the duck pieces were overly fatty but I was happy with the spice level and the flavors. The pud kee mao - basil noodle - (with pork) we ordered at a 4 star. Very happy with it. Awesome spice level, nice flavor, everything cooked well.   I was a little surprised that the \"very spicy\" 4 star never triggered the waterworks. It made me slow down once or twice, but not as intense as I was expecting. (I have a feeling the jump from 4 to 5 is pretty intense, though.) Enjoyable, especially in the company of others, as I wasn't really looking to be crying in my corner of the couch the whole meal.   Also, we called around 830 on a Sunday night and they said it would be 30 minutes (and it ended up taking a little bit longer) Really? Didn't seem to be any other orders being made, but oh well, good thing we weren't starving.  Overall, I think I'm more partial to other thai places in the area, but thai thai will definitely be on my list of options.",

I was impressed they would take out the fish & oyster sauce from their noodles for vegetarians, that was a plus for me. One thing I will point out is the abundance of veggies you will get in your dish.  If you don't want an entire garden you might want to ask which veggies come in the dish.  I enjoyed the chili basil stir fry, but I could have done without the 101 veggies in it. I will recommend this place to others, but be mindful of the time.",

    "text": "You Want 5 Spicy?   Telling someone how spicy you want your food varies. Sometimes you want wings or maybe salsa. These things are easy to say hot or mild and knowing exactly what you will get, but going to a Thai restaurant and not knowing how spicy they can make it may be hazardous to your health.  Waiting for my girlfriend getting takeout from Outback Steak House I noticed a place called Thai Thai Takeout right behind it. I instantly was craving something spicy. I walked in to this takeout restaurant looking around and seeing nothing, but a cash register and a kitchen behind it. No cheap statues or posters hanging on the wall that are supposed to give you the hint you're in another world.  Upon ordering the pepper chicken I was asked that question that I love to hear. \"How spicy do you want it?\" I wanted as spicy as it could be so I calmly said, \"On a scale 1 to 5, 5 being the spiciest, I want 5 spicy.\" She repeated what I said with excitement, \"You want five spicy?\"  After getting home to my TV set, I popped open the Togo container and started flushing this soupy food into my mouth. After about 3 bites I felt a concentrated tenderness in my throat. Realizing right then I had forgotten how spicy I ordered it.  After two glasses of milk and some bread the food got tossed in the trash and my ego shuttered below normal. When I thought I had a mouth that could take the heat, 5 spicy came along. Spicy or not the food was nothing more than the standard satisfactory.",

In fact there are some spices they're using here that are not common in most Thai restaurants. The signature Pad Thai is AMAZING. It's not on the House Specialties but certainly should be. Veggies - bright and perfectly cooked, sauces - aromatic and provoking, meats and seafood - always fresh and uber tasty. This is a take out only place in case you didn't get that from the name. It takes a bit longer from order to pick up but that's because it's the best. Super friendly owner (I'm assuming she's the owner). She's always there and one of the sweetest people I've met here. She has some magical way of knowing who you are when you walk through the door - knows your order and always has a smile. Thank you Thai Thai for picking our hood to set up shop!!

Just to start off with--I really wanted to like Thai Thai, truly, I did. I heard they had won awards like \"Best Takeout in CLT\" plus who doesn't love the idea of a take out only place?  So when I moved to Dilworth, I was stoked to have it nearby. I could call in my order, be there within 10 minutes and be on my merry way with a container full of noodles. That was the idea in my head at least. Like any Thai place I try, I judge them based off of their Pad Thai which is really difficult to mess up. The first time I went there, it was meh. There was absolutely no flavor to it, the veggies were funky and the tofu didn't seem like it was cooked enough. So maybe it was a bad batch, very possible. I gave it a second chance and ordered it with some extra spice that time around and it was not spicy whatsoever. Wtf? When I say I want spicy, I want my mouth to tingle a bit and maybe even sweat. I did try it the day after  and it was actually better than it was fresh and was enjoyable after adding a few tablespoons of the rooster.   So now, each time I drive or walk past Thai Thai, a little piece of my heart breaks. I really wanted it to be my good-to takeout spot but I just don't see it ever happening.",

I don't know exactly how they make it, but I can certainly taste quality fish sauce and tamarind in their pad thai. If you're used to the sweet \"American-Style\" pad thai that's service in most thai places, Thai Thai will be very foreign to you.   The minimum wait time is usually 25 minutes. Call ahead is the best option. I drive from Concord to pick up takeout from Thai Thai in Dilworth. So, I usually place my order just before I leave home.

I didn't believe the reviews (my boyfriend and I can house good food, and never have leftovers from Thai when we order), but my fridge is full of leftovers - we barely made a dent.  Red Curry (#25) - delicious; the shrimp was de-tailed and fresh; less thick (?) than other curries from competitors, but it seemed more authentic to me. Generous serving of veggies in there, too.  Pad Thai - also great; this dish reminded me of the good Thai you can get on the West coast.  Seriously, this is the place to go if you want Thai take out. Super value for the price and portion size.

Also, tried some chicken Larb and was very, very impressed. Definitely on par with my favorite Thai restaurant in the US (Ruen Pair in the Thai Town district of Los Angeles).  Having said that, I'd really like it if they'd expand their menu to include more authentic Thai dishes. I would LOVE to be able to order pork leg over rice or glass noodle soup. But that's light criticism for an otherwise excellent Thai restaurant.",

Seeing as to how they don't actually have tables here so you can eat, I'd be surprised if it was dirty.   The lady is pretty friendly and straight to the point.

I asked for spice level 3. I wasn't sure what to order, but the lady who answered the phone said it was a popular choice.   I walked into the small restaurant, which has no seating room, and was greeted by chef. She was very friendly and talked to me about all of the dishes on their menu. She recommends the duck, all of the curries, and the Pad Thai. As I picked up my meal to take home, I immediately noticed how much the food weighed. I knew I was getting several meals out of my $10.00 plate   I got home with my meal, sat down on the couch, and was ready to binge watch some Netflix. I  opened my box and was greeted with an overwhelming aroma of spices. There was broccoli, onions, basil, tomatoes, and chicken. The rice was cooked perfectly and the veggies were not over/undercooked. It was hot, but not unbearable. I will try a spice level 4 next time.  I cannot wait for next time.",

After calling ahead and giving them more than 30 min before picking it up, there was still 15 min required. So, just don't go here if you're in a rush to eat. Beyond that, not much that can be said negatively about it. And with that said, the food and the value make this a four star spot in my opinion.  I've only been here a few times but each time I have the food has been great, and plentiful! You can easily get three separate meals out of a takeout order from here and I tend to eat more than I probably should!  My latest meal from here was the Red Curry with chicken and it was great. I ordered it a spice level 5 and it was the perfect amount of hotness. Highly recommend if you're a fan of spicy food.  I've also had the Pud Thai from here as well and it doesn't disappoint. I'm very much looking forward to the next order I takeout from here. I'm guessing it will be another one of their delicious curry dishes.",

The fresh shrimp spring rolls, vegetarian tom yum soup, ginger stir fry with chicken and shrimp and a side of hot sauce! I've found a few favorites and am guilty of ordering the same things over and over again. The food isn't fancy - it's flavorful, simple and fresh - exactly what you want for dinner when you're in no mood to cook. The pad thai is mediocre (I am yet to find amazing Pad thai in Charlotte), but I do like the pad see ew noodles. Some of the stir fry's are mild in flavor, but the curries are quite flavorful. On the weekend, make sure you place your order well ahead because it could take up to an hour to be ready. and don't give up if no one answers the phone and you've tried calling 5 times, try one more time. It's a really small family run kitchen, and sometimes it takes a few tries to get someone on the phone. Now, if only they delivered... :D",

I called them in at 5:45 (they only open at 5).   The dishes we ordered were more saucy then I've ever experienced in my life. The ratio of sauce to food was severely disproportioned. I referred to it as \"bobbing for food\" with my chopsticks.   The rice was cold!   This said, the flavor and spice was spot on.

They used to have a brick and mortar in what became a sketchy section of town (which is when I started with them), so they moved to this location and are now only carryout.  Their food is heaven.  We have a standard order:  lots of fresh spring rolls (vegetarian and full of noodles and vegetables and mint leaves with a peanutty dipping sauce that makes me have bad thoughts), tofu tod (deep fried tofu for the hubby with an even peanuttier dipping sauce), pad thai (no onions, no tofu, extra broccoli for me and no eggs for the hubby).  Mmmmmm  When you call, you will be talking to Pim, who is a treasure.  I'm sure her husband, the cook, is also lovely, but I don't interact with him.  Pim will remember you and the vagaries of your order (see above) and is always super perky without being annoying.  Some other reviews mention that she has sometimes been a little optimistic about wait times, but I've recently heard her tell people on the phone \"be over an hour\", so she's getting more realistic.  If you'd like a Thai place in Charlotte that can get you food quickly, I can recommend several, but there's a reason Thai Thai has the wait it does.  THE FOOD.  LOVE THEM.  Sorry.

Now enduring the wait gives you some pretty great tasting thai food.  There is plenty of it too.  A lot of times I find myself wanting more rice since the sauce tends to overpower... but they give you a bunch and I pretty much inhaled it all.  Really the serving is good for 2 meals, but I was really hungry after the wait and not eating anything but a salad all day.  We placed an order at 7:15... and we were out of the place by 8:05.  Granted the poor lady seemed to be working the kitchen and the front at the same time - they could have been understaffed that night....  Combine that with the rainy weather and lots of people wanting thai food = long wait.  Oh well -  I will try you again someday Thai Thai... maybe on a day where I am not rushing to do anything.",

Fire up the Yelp app and find what's close to the homestead. Enter: Thai Thai Takeout.   Do yourself a favor and do a thorough read-through of all of the reviews and tips before placing your order. Great Thai with several \"asterisks\" included. Here's my take:   Was a little confused by calling in our order. They open at 5pm and I called at 5:01pm and the phone kept going to voicemail. Then, I finally entered into a phone battle with the rest of humanity who wanted Thai Thai at the same time as we did. Busy signals galore....Finally got through and placed our order with.....ease? Had to go through our order a few times but felt confident they got it down. She quoted 20 minutes. No problem, right? WRONG. Ran a few errands and then entered the waiting room of death.   Quoted 20 minutes. Showed up 30 minutes after I placed our order, walk in....you guessed it. Food isn't ready. In fact, no one even came out front to say \"Hello! It'll just be a minute!\" There were 5 other folks in the same boat as us. Sad day for all of us Thai-loving folks. After waiting another 15-20 minutes or so in the land of Thai Thai employee desolation, a woman came up to the front and rung us up! Happy day! It was hilarious watching her pick up the phone and hang up on other folks calling in. Goes to show how busy this place really gets. Sounded like there were only two people working behind in the kitchen, too.   So, despite the miscommunications, long....LONG wait, more waiting, and....waiting, and being misquoted on pick-up time, the food was nothing short of awesome. I ordered the Pud See Ew with shrimp. Smoky, thick noodles with a hefty portion of broccoli throughout, sriracha, and a few other veggies. It was magic. Just what was needed for a rainy day, post move in. My wife had the veggie pineapple curry. Holy cow, I wish this came in sports drink form. I'd drink from a squirt bottle! It was delicious. Creamy, mild, packed with veg. Teamed up with a nice bowl of white rice. Food was the jam and we ate it all!   So, the lessons are:   1- Don't believe a word of how long they say it will take. 2- Be prepared to wait even longer 3- Don't expect amazing service 4- Your food will be worth the anguish  Moral of the story: Thai Thai is wonderful.",

I've been in and out of Charlotte for the last 2-1/2 years and have yet to find a Thai restaurant that matches what I've found in other big cities. After being disappointed time and time again, I decided to give this place another try. UPDATE! This time I wasn't disappointed, there was a depth of flavor that was lacking before. I also asked for \"hot and spicy.\" It could have been hotter, but next time I will push the envelope and ask for the hottest level they make. In any case, I am happy with what they provide, and they have plenty of vegetarian options. One word of advice, it takes a long time to get your order, I would add 10 or 15 minutes to whatever they tell you or otherwise you will be waiting when you arrive.",

    "text": "I first discovered this place when I lived off Kings Dr, about 6 years ago. Even now, living on the other side of town, which makes it a further drive (with plenty of other Thai options between here and there) Thai Thai Takeout is my go-to for Thai food.  The location is clean, and easily accessible with plenty of parking. The food is reasonably priced, and I've yet to have a dish I didn't find completely satisfying. I am fairly certain it's literally 2 people running the place: a man who runs the kitchen, and a woman who takes orders and checks people out. They are both very friendly, and even remember my preferred spice level (1 star spicy for this white girl, please) which makes me feel really special for some odd reason.   There are two reasons I didn't give 5 stars. One is that the wait time is insane, and almost always quoted incorrectly (if they tell you it will be ready in 30 minutes, get there in 45 minutes). I am sure this is due to the aforementioned two-person staffing model but can still be a bit of a drag. The other is that my boyfriend, who loves his food spicy, says that even when requesting the highest level of spice, it's not really spicy at all. I am fine with lower level of spice but I know a lot of people are drawn to Thai food specifically for the spice.   Still, if you plan ahead, and don't mind the supposed lack of spiciness, Thai Thai Takeout is a good choice for yummy Thai food!",

I was stuck in the nearby hospital and thought this would be just the trick to break up the gastrointestinal dismay that is known as the cardiac diet. I called the order in right at 5pm, 3 dishes and they said it would be 20 minutes. Cool.  My runner got there on time and waited another 10 minutes, no biggie as there were orders streaming in non stop while she was there. Got the food and the amounts were huge, no way I was going to be able make any kind of meaningful dents in these containers!   First up, the tom yum chicken soup. Not bad but not the best I've ever experienced. I ordered it extra hot and it was very spicy but mainly just from the hot oil on top, not from an overall flavor profile. The chicken was cooked nicely and there were plenty of mushrooms which I love. A little salty but lacking the oomph of a better tom yum.  Next up the yellow curry with squid. I liked this dish a lot, paired up to the while rice really well (they don't offer brown). The squid had a slight tooth to it which I like and had a nice mild flavor. The vegetables were properly cooked and the spice level was proper at a 3 star. Sauce was a little chalky, just barely noticeable but it didn't bother me one bit.   We also tried the Massamun curry tofu with vegetables. Solid offering of curry here, huge amount for the price. Great flavor and mild heat at a two star provided a great mellow finish to the meal.   If you need Thai food to go in the midtown area, make sure to pay a visit to ThaiThai.",

The Pad Thai is a little saucier than other local options, but the flavor is good. I actually enjoy it chilled the next day for breakfast even (weird, I know). The fried tofu is perfectly soft and crisp. The staff is also very friendly and there's a giant bowl of self-serve fortune cookies on your way out.   My only (small) complaint is that sometimes it can take a long time for the food to be prepped. It does make sense some though, as the restaurant is small and seems to be a family biz.",

I had tried it a few times before and was underwhelmed by their Pad Thai and their Pud See Ew was definitely not yummerific like Monsoon or other Thai places. Other times I've called in and the wait was super long like an hour and we punted.  It seemed to me that if you're takeout only, you should be darn good at it. Like Taipei Express is like a 10 minute wait. Anyways.  This time I called ahead at 6 for a 6:35 pickup and ordered steamed veggies with shrimp and peanut sauce (okay and very thick and sweet but not spicy even though I ordered with 2 stars) and Lard Nar with chicken and broccoli which had a bad taste. in fact I took 2 bites and tossed the rest.   I love Thai food so much I wanted to love this place but the search continues... Hopefully the next place will also have lunch service.",

Was shocked that tigers was anything open and thought I would give it a try since I was in the mood for Asian food and I doubt I would find anything open at that hour. The hours on the store say 10pm, but I walked in a little after 10:15 and they served me. I'm sure it was also because there were people in there as well waiting for their food and I caught them at the right time.   I've never seen a Thai place that was solely take out and thought it was a good place to get food quick if I lived here. I ordered pad se eew which was pretty good. Since they had a seafood option I got the seafood combination and not the typical chicken or pork I would normally get. I thought the dish was pretty good. I'm assuming that if it were normal hours it would have been a little better but i can't complain. Not the best that I have had but it wouldn't stop me from coming back and trying other dishes.   I as well tried the steamed shrimp dumplings. I should have got them fried but  of course I was trying to be \"healthy\" which I seem to regret a lot of the time. The dumplings as well looked like they were mixed in with ground chicken or some meat because it was not all shrimp. The sauces that came with it were pretty good and I think that if it was not as late as it was I would have tried other appetizers.   The thai iced tea was as well pretty tasty and I wish I would have gotten more. Overall I think that this was a good find and if I get a chance I would love to try many more dishes. The employees there were all Thai so I trust that it is all authentic. Of course being Thai myself and growing up eating all these foods I have a higher bar than most people who have only had Thai food at different locations.",

    "text": "Thai Thai was recommended to us by multiple friends and, after moving to the Dilworth area, we decided there was no better time to walk over and try it out. We frequent Basil and Thai Taste for casual Thai comfort food and thought that this would be a great, walkable addition to our repertoire.   The menu is large with options for customization on almost all dishes and the prices are considerably less than most other local Thai restaurants, which made sense to us since it is takeout-only. We decided to start with the Shrimp Rolls which were basically shrimp wrapped in egg roll wrappers and fried (as described on the menu). They were flavorful for a basic dish and the accompanying chili sauce was delicious. We followed the shrimp rolls with Pad Thai--a classic favorite of ours that both Basil and Thai Taste make very well. The portions lived up to the hype from our friends, big enough to make 2+ meals out of--which is a great deal for around $11. Despite the large portion sizes for a low price, the flavor and spice were lacking.   We ordered one chicken and one shrimp pad thai, both at a 3-level spice (on a scale of 1-5). The spice was lacking...it almost tasted as though no spice was added at all. The sauce was very runny and bland, there was little to no flavor in it and the chopped peanuts were thrown on top added zero to the dish whereas they typically add some additional flavor.   The staff at the restaurant was very friendly, but disorganized--they weren't sure of what went in our order when we arrived for pickup as a result of not asking for a name when we called it in. We plan to try Thai Thai again and choose some alternate dishes in the future to see if we can have any luck since this restaurant is so close but we certainly will not be running back, especially with other Thai options within a 5 mile radius.",

    "text": "So I really wanted to like Thai Thai Takeout, but unfortunately it did not stack up to its competition in the area.   The positives? It's open on Sunday's when a lot of other Thai restaurants in the area are closed.   The negatives? Taste. I felt that the pad see ew and the pad kee mao that we ordered lacked flavor. We ordered the pad kee mao with medium spice and all you could taste was the extreme spice. But the flavors weren't actually developed beyond that.   Also, the grease factor was high!   It's conveniently located, however, I think next time we'll order pizza",

    "text": "Meh. I wish that I could blame my not so great experience of the food on the delivery service that was used.. but I cannot. Let me preface that I am SUPER picky with my Thai food, and I have been to Thailand and it is almost a comfort food to me. I absolutely love almost all (good) Thai food. I don't always require it to be spicy, however I do expect the flavors to actually be what they are supposed to be.  I was up visiting my sister at her apartment (I live on just the other side on the SC border), and she had heard many good things about this place, and so we were open to trying it. I don't recall the main dish that my sister had, but I ordered my absolute favorite, as it had been a while since I have had a really good yellow curry. She also ordered a side of fried rice and some veggie spring rolls. We threw most of it out. The flavors were terrible.  My yellow curry flavor was SO wrong and not even close to what yellow curry is supposed to be (and wasn't even the right color or thickness, it was very watery). The basic ingredients and flavor were not even there, and it had an overpowering flavor of cinnamon. I did ask for it to be spicy (they asked what level out of 5 I wanted, and I said 5).. it was not spicy at all - I was expecting at least some heat!! We had to double check to make sure it was rung up correctly (it was). Maybe it was just a bad batch. The fried rice tasted a bit off as well, and the veggie spring rolls were so fried and tasted like it was just pure wrap, and nothing inside. We were disappointed to say the least, and we ended up cooking up some stuff that we found in her fridge after over spending and throwing our meal away.  Again, possibly we had bad timing with the food (my sister had noodles of some sort, and she did not like hers either), but needless to say, we may give this place another shot, however we will most likely try somewhere else before we go back here.",

There is just no depth of flavor or complexity that is usually present in Thai food. Cashew Nuts sauce was more like gravy. Chicken was overcooked and rubbery. The shrimp spring rolls were pretty great but not enough to overcome the total blandness of my meal. It was basically like shopping center Chinese food meets Thai food, in a bad way. Portions are huge and if that's your primary goal, the value proposition is huge. But the only huge takeaway I have is huge disappointment.",

My family and I are huge Thai food fans and have practically tried all the Thai places in Charlotte and wanted to try the food here. We don't live close to the restaurant so it never came across as an option considering it's only a Togo place, however I was in the area around dinner.   I didn't like this place for multiple reasons  1. They don't have a menu you can order from on their website because their website is nonexistent. I don't know how you are supposed to order to go without it. Even when we got to the restaurant they were out of menus.  2. The food was not good everything was either bland and dry even though there was a good amount of sauce at the bottom almost as it's over cooked.   If I were u I would trust all the other reviews and not go. Not worth it and we tried a good amount of different parts of Thai food. Curry, stir fry, appetizers, and noodles all were a disappointment.",

The menu is pretty large, as are the portions. One order is usually two meals. The prices are also extremely reasonable for the amount you're getting.   Appetizers: the fried spring rolls are delicious, the egg drop soup is about average, and the thai lettuce wraps are quite tasty.   Mains: my wife LOVES the green coconut curry (#28 aka Gaeng Keow Wan). I'm pretty partial to the drunken noodle (#66 aka Basil Noodle aka Pud Kee Mao). #65 Pud See Ew (wide noodle) is great if you're not a fan of the basily taste.",

Then go ahead, feel free to order in person. You should allow a good 20 minutes at least.   I love Thai food. My go to order here is the drunken noodles. I'm a sucker for those big wide noodles. For me, it's enough to split into two meals. There are five levels of heat: one star - not so spicy, two stars - spicy, three stars - medium spicy, four stars - very spicy, five stars - very very spicy. I usually go level three. I love spicy food, but am a little scared of just how spicy that next star up is. I'll report back when I get brave.   The friendly woman at the counter remembers all the regulars. And a reminder again, speed is not their thing. Add on to that, they get a ton of orders. Seriously, the phone rings nonstop. If you need to kill some time here, go wander around Fresh Market next door. Don't forget to grab a fortune cookie from the bowl!",

After waiting about an hour and 40 minutes (plus the driving time for the door dash driver) I'm so sad. The food was extremely subpar and it looked like someone threw up all over my Pad Thai.

Upon arrival, we found that Thai Thai Takeout was an actual small takeout joint, there was no place to dine it. This is fine with me if a place can put out good food.   My boyfriend and I were surprised at how heavy our two takeout boxes were. Our food was jam packed with veggies and chicken. I really enjoyed the fried rice but felt like the kee mao was not to the book. The kee mao didn't have as many peppers and onions as I would have hoped for, it seemed more like pad see ew than kee mao. It also wasn't as spicy as I had hoped, I asked for 3.5/5 but got more like a 1.5.   Regardless, we will be back for more. Yay for Thai food!",

They clearly do not use one of the most important ingredients in authentic Pad Thai, which is tamarind. This is an orangey, sticky type of substance that is similar to honey but unique all its own and without the flavor of tamarind, pad thai just tastes like chili paste -- which is exactly what this dish tasted like. They also made the dish with WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE. The noodles were swimming! It was more like an Udon soup than a Pad Thai dish. I was horribly disappointed, and to wait over an HOUR after calling was adding insult to injury -- even though I was prepared for that issue thanks to the previous reviewers. I was NOT prepared for such an incredibly disappointing meal. I will never return and the only thing I can assume about you positive reviewers is either you've never had delicious Thai food or you are friends/family of the owners.",

    "text": "My bf and I are both fans of Thai Thai.  Our food is always prepared super fast and it's still hot by the time we get it home.  My bf always gets the special Volcano Chicken.  Two huge pieces of breaded chicken cut into strips with white rice and steamed veggies....it comes with a huge container of what I guess is \"volcano\" sauce and this stuff is spicy!  If you like super spicy Thai, this one is for you.  Warning: after consuming the whole meal, Kevin usually gets \"the itis\" and remains worthless for the rest of the night.  I had Pad Thai with tofu and it was alright.  Not the best PT I have ever had but definitely the best I have found in Charlotte.  Tasty crispy spring rolls too and really good Thai iced tea.",

There was actually spice and flavor in both dishes we got (Pad Thai and Pepper Garlic), which is something a lot of places just don't get.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I'll get take-out from Thai Thai a couple of times a month.  The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.  I usually get the Pad See Ew (broad noodles with broccoli and chicken) which is always delicious.  I've never found them to be especially fast in preparing the food but they're usually pretty accurate when they quote you a time.  So, if you're calling on a weekend and they say 30 minutes, don't get there too early or you'll wind up waiting.",

    "text": "Being in the restaurant business myself, I don't believe in reviewing a restaurant after just one visit. Behind the scenes, a lot can happen on any particular day; and only if things seem to fall apart on a consistent basis should a restaurant really take a \"review hit\" for slow food, poor service, etc. But only after a number of visits can someone be able to review the most important and hardly ever discussed factor behind the over quality of a restaurant: CONSISTENCY.  I have dined with Thai Thai 20- plus times. They get 4 stars for being (overall) hot food, tasty food ( step up your spice number would you- it's Thai food), friendly, mistake free, and price point. Does the food take some time to be prepared because its fresh and other patrons share your craving? Yes. Just try to see a wait at an establishment as a good thing and take responsibility for your own timing and desire to eat. Eat up Charlotte, it's an incredible life.",
