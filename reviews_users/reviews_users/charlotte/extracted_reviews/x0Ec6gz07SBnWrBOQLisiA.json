My coworkers and I went super early for lunch on a Friday at 11:20 a.m. to make sure we got a seat, which was a smart move because it was packed when we left.  Thanks to the Yelp reviews, I had an idea of what to expect, but it's still a little intimidating. However, there was an incredibly nice, helpful Chopt employee working the line to answer questions and make suggestions. Even the salad putter-togetherers and choppers were helpful, funny, and friendly!  I had checked out the menu ahead of time so that I wouldn't be as overwhelmed, and I went with the Harvest Cobb - spinach, beets, apples, cranberries, goat cheese, and chicken (hold the romaine) with white balsamic vinaigrette. Yuuuummmmmm. It was delicious and HUGE. We all had enough leftover to get to-go boxes, and I'm so excited that I get to eat it again.",

I used to joke that I spent my paycheck every week on over priced salads, before I moved to Texas for a year and a half.  Now that I'm back in Charlotte of course I would return to Chopt! I've places two separate pick up orders and disappointed more each time.  The first I asked for the Tex mex ranch on my tinga salad mixed in and Chopt, as well as a extra side.   I prob should have checked but got home and the salad was NOT chopped and there was no dressing on the salad or otherwise on the side.  Today I tried a second time.  This time most the chicken mix was hard as a rock and inedible.  Perhaps it was the bottom of the pot I don't know.  Lesson learned that if I come back I will NOT call a take out order.   I find it frustrating that I've had two 12$ bowls that have been thrown away.   I hope this place can get back on track.",

I might suggest looking up the menu online first, if you have time, so you're not standing in line for 10 minutes trying to figure out what you want (like I did)... but I can't imagine any impulsive menu choice being a bad one here!  I finally landed on the Kale Caesar Salad with chicken and creamy Caesar dressing. Best salad I've ever eaten. Every ingredient was so fresh. It was fun to watch them make it, but even better to scarf down!  The managers were present, extremely kind and helpful. I appreciated the staff's recommendations and can't wait to try something different next time!",

We typically take our salads to go and enjoy them at home. My husband usually gets the Mexican Caesar with Mexican goddess dressing and I like to make my own, usually with the spicy red peppers, cooked onions, beets and falafel. I prefer the falafel chopped up with the salad rather than left whole. I too usually go for Mexican Ceasar, it's creamy, spicy and vegan, or the Dijon. I also love to try to specials that are inspired by different international locations. I choose well so I never feel bad about eating chopt. The small slice of fresh bread is also a nice addition.

It was heavily dressed and too big to finish so half of it went to waste. I wouldn't come here again because it just isn't for me.",

    "text": "Why isn't this in Chicago?! My brother introduced me to Chopt after a week of eating not-so healthily and feeling guilty about it. The line wasn't too bad and we were greeted by someone who oriented us to how to order. The menu is nicely organized with calorie counts for every item, down to the salad dressings. Overwhelmed with the selections, I opted to try one of the \"First-Time Favorites\", particularly the Santa Fe, but was concerned how spicy the recommended dressing would be. The guy made several recs for alternatives, including their best-selling \"Mexican Goddess\" or the \"California Goddess\". I appreciated not only that you can sub out the dressing but that you can sample them before committing. I opted for the Mexican Goddess for the subtle spice and cilantro vs. the creamier California version. There is an assembly line of people putting your order together that finishes at the chopping station, where your salad gets chopped and dressed to your liking before getting tossed all together. The to-go bowls are clear and deep, making it perfect to take the salad home. You also can get a complementary slice of bread with your order. I really liked the Santa Fe Salad - the ingredients were fresh and the fried onions homemade. We came back a few days later for a late night dinner. The Kale Caesar was also very good.",

You can choose to DIY your own salad, choose one of their pre-made recipes, or one of the monthly specials that feature a different destination.  The April country is Peru.  I was a bit taken aback during my first Chopt visit - I didn't realize that there was actually a chopping station.  My life is complete now.  Your first stop, you choose your lettuce, then you choose your proteins and veggies.  Then they send you to a chopper station.  That person chops your salad, helps you choose a dressing (ask for a taste if you can't make a decision), then they mix it all together.  Don't forget to get some complimentary bread and try some of their interesting drinks - organic black tea, raspberry lemonade, cucumber water.",

I love that even their signature salad you can add and subtract what you would like in your salad this is total customization. However my negative for this particular chopped restaurant franchise is that the selection of beverages aren't far-reaching and for those of us who would choose to have carbonation you are excluded. Their lemonades are very tasteless and their teas aren't good as well. Even if you are opposed to soda at least have some drink options that are better tasting epic fail to me for beverage choices.

But what I really liked is that the staff explains everything to you and you can easily make additions or substitutions to your custom salad as needed.   I decided to go with the Chopped salad because it basically had so many yummy ingredients I couldn't pass up. It's packed with chicken, ranch smoked bacon, an egg, blue cheese and tomatoes. I switched the dressing out for the Mexican Goddess and if your a fan of salad dressing's with a little kick I'd absolutely recommend it. Don't worry, you can sample the dressing before they out it in AND they ask you to let them know how much dressing you'd like on your salad. (Yep, you're totally winning here).   Just watching them make the salads is cool but what's better is that they are a good size portion with fresh and tasty ingredients.   Chop't you had me at hello.....see ya soon!",

    "text": "I totally love the fresh concept and originality of this restaurant! I've actually never seen anything before like it. The vegan items are plentiful and clearly marked on the menu. The place looked clean and contemporary. While they have numerous beverage concoctions (brewed tea or infused waters) that were sweetened with honey, they also had equal amounts that were vegan. The calories are clearly posted and you can easily make a meal that is waist-friendly.  The reason I'm not rating it with more stars is because the ordering and pick up process is a little hectic, jumbled, and overall chaotic. The menu is also not clear about what the sandwich is. The board states that you get your choice of green with the sandwich, so I thought it was a lettuce wrap, but instead they serve the sandwich in a tortilla, but that is not stated anywhere. I was not given the bread with my salad like other posts mentioned.   Then although they appeared to be eco-friendly, you throw your trash into the same receptacle as the excessive plastic salad bowl and lid instead of separating them, so I wonder if someone really picks through the garbage to ensure that the items are actually recycled and not sent to a landfill. It was also very noisy in the restaurant.  Despite the above, I would still consider going again.",

    "text": "Chopt is among the better fast casual salad options I've tried. The menu is large with 10-12 salads to choose from, three seasonal salads and a build your own option. I had the Cobb and subbed the Dijon dressing for the chipotle vinaigrette. The ingredients were fresh and perfectly \"Chopt\" by an employee using a Mezzanine knife. Salads can be served in a bowl or in a large plastic to-go container that includes a lid. Salads are also offered a piece of bread to accompany your meal. I really enjoyed the bread as it was soft with a great crispy crust. The dining room looks a bit small, but there is a second room toward the back of the restaurant with plenty of seating for small and large groups. It's easy to understand why Chopt is a fan favorite in Charlotte and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, healthy meal packed with flavor.",

It was super busy and if you're new to this salad making concept, it can be a bit overwhelming, yet fun! Plus, any new featured salads are offered as samples to those waiting in line.   I tried the Sante Fe Chicken Salad. Once you've placed your order you then follow the person behind the counter that walks your bowl of ingredients to the \"chop\" station. Needless to say, it was organized chaos because there isn't much distinction between one line and the next.   At checkout, the cashier was very friendly. However, I wasn't too sold on the total price coming to almost $18 for just a salad and a drink. The size of the salad was plentiful, but I can't wholeheartedly say it was the best I've had.",

You have the ability to select from a wide variety of fresh lettuce, vegetables, fruits and beans. Everything is fresh.  The salad is prepared in front view while chopping everything into small bite size pieces. There are too many dressing to choose from to list but it defiantly has something to shock those taste buds.

    "text": "As an already established fan of Chop't - I've had it on trips to other cities - I knew what to expect. However, I do have to say I really liked the layout of this particular location. Maybe this has something to do with its still shiny, new veneer, but the ENTIRE staff was so friendly and upbeat.  I went in after the lunch rush (around 2:15ish) and there was a manager walking around and directing patrons to menus and answering questions. Before I went in, I had taken some time to look at the menu online so I knew what I wanted. I ordered the santa fe salad with the chipotle vinaigrette dressing on the side. The chipotle vinaigrette has a spicy kick, like VERY spicy.   If you are a Chop't newbie, I highly suggest looking at the menu online to get a feel of what they already offer and it'll give you a chance to look over the ingredients in case you want to come up with your own salad creation. The salads are HUGE and I'm able to get two separate meals out of them. With the size, there comes a price. My santa fe salad (with the addition of grilled chicken) came to just under $10. I don't really consider that price too bad considering Zaxby's charges $8 for a salad that's 1/3 of the size.  If salads are your thing, definitely do not pass up the chance to enjoy what other cities have known for a long time now: Chop't is delicious!",

The price can get a little up there for a salad I will admit when you start adding things extra to it. Its super healthily and the staff is really friendly when its your time at the chopping block lol. Lunch time at this particular location can get a little packed but its worth the wait. The have a lot of options and I think they change there menu every 60 to 90 days. Of course they keep their basic salad option but you get to try salads and dressings from different locations around the world.",

I finally got the nerve up to head in and was pleasantly surprised. There was definitely a long line, but Chopt essentially has an assembly line set up minimize prep time. There was a great selection of salads on the menu and also a \"create your own\" option. The pre-set selections covered pretty much every combination under the sun with kale, lettuce, spinach, mixes, toppings from hear to yon, and dressings coming out of your ears. Almost overwhelming, but in a good way.  I settled on the Santa Fe (no meat!) because I like to sweat a little bit when I eat, and it was listed as a \"First Time Favorite\". I can back up that claim. I love a good romaine crunch in my salads, there was a healthy helping of my favorite food (pepperjack cheese), and the corn, avocado, tomatoes, and fried onions were an awesome combo. The sweet & smokey chipotle vinaigrette was just that, and definitely met the sweat quotient I require in a meal.   Prep time was very quick and also awesome to watch. They offer regular soda options as well as some drinks from their cooler such as sparkling water.",

    "text": "Was fortunate enough to hear that Chopt was having a limited free lunch serving on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. I snuck into the new location around 11:30am and was greeted by a friendly (manager?) who was helping direct the first-timers and show us the lay of the land.   A warning to newbies: expect this place to be very busy in the first upcoming weeks. Chop't has a bit of a cult following and rightfully so. Expect people to be a little bit slow in ordering until they get a hang of the layout. This is the south after all.   After standing in a long, but quickly moving queue, you order from a well-prepared selection of salad choices, as well as a make-your-own option. They also have a pretty awesome kids menu if that's your thing.  Now let me tell you, people come to this place for the ingredients. They are plentiful and so fresh and there are really so many different choices. I chose the Mexican Caesar salad which was appointed one of the \"first time favorites\". After ordering and customizing your choice, you and your salad are then assigned to a \"chopper\".   The \"chopper\" allows you to customize the type and amount of dressing/salt/and pepper, and then thoroughly mixes and chops it all together. Don't let the size of the bowl fool you, after they chop everything and smash it into the bowl...this is A LOT of salad. Think, hard to finish in one sitting sized salad. The guy next to me in line opted for the hot quinoa bowl option which looked totally delicious and will most certainly be one of the next choices I try when I get there.   At the register, this time they allowed us to enjoy the meal gratis, while suggesting a donation to a cool local charity: Green Teacher Network. Don't skip the drinks, because their sweet tea and lemonade sweetened with honey is not to be missed. Their dining room is small and noisy, but has a comfortable mix of booths and regular tables.   Thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the employees were friendly and quick, and you guys will definitely be seeing me again soon.",

I noticed a fellow Yelper who I'm friends with regularly check-in here and take amazing pictures of amazing looking salad. I bookmarked this place a short while back and after running some errands with my children we decided to check this place out to see what the hype was all about.  Well it was a great idea to do so, we arrived just in time as we had a wait but but was nothing like the line that formed while we were seated and eating.  I had one of the destination salads (La Chinesta) and my daughter a Caesar salad. The destination salads are limited time salads that they change often so I decided to try one of the destinations while they exist since the other salads are always there to try.   I LOVED the process from start to finish and the staff were all so informative and helpful. Customer service at its BEST, I had a small hiccup in my Happy FLOW that was quickly resolved by management. Not just one manager but two partners (owning partners) came over to our table to discuss and have great fun dialogue. Big ups to those gentleman as they didn't have to take the time out of their day (managing such an amazing restaurant and greeting the customers) to come over to us. Jim and Michael you are the real MVP's and I look forward to returning.  Before leaving I ordered the hubby a salad to go since he was at work and this chopper was EXTREMELY messy (most of the salad and toppings were flying to other stations) but hey messy taste God according to my husband when he ate his salad.   I also overhead management discussing the expansion with some others and I heard there will be one in Blakney in January which is a SCORE as that's really close to me (insert Happy Dance)..",

It is brilliant to have a healthy quick serve option and Chopt does it well. We just wanted a light and quick lunch since it was later in the afternoon and Chopt was perfect!   It is clean, everyone is helpful and friendly, and the menu has any salad option you could possibly ever want!! Not to mention I am in love with the fact that there was no soda, the utensils and to-go items were environmentally friendly, they have recycling, and food items are locally sourced! You cannot get any higher up on my list!  You just go through line, watch them prepare what you have decided to indulge in, grab your food and a nice lemonade or organic tea and sit down. There are tables out in front, too, so you can enjoy the outdoors while chowing down!   The ingredients are fresh, lettuce is crisp (and they even ensure they have \"chopt\" it to the size of your easy-to-bite liking), they do not overdress your salad with dressing (they make sure the amount is good for you), and they rotate speciality salads/bowls often keeping the spark alive.   Well no other way to end this but to say I am so thrilled to have finally seen the Chopt light!! I have even learned there are locations in most of my frequently traveled cities. Joy! I will be back and I will work my way through the menu with a smile on my face!",

(It was late afternoon so not their busiest time, but still steady traffic). I ordered the Santa Fe with TexMex ranch. Amazing! I love that the salad is chopped, then they mix it just enough to toss the dressing. I'm that person that always manages to make a mess while cutting up my salad, so this is perfect for me. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I wish something this great was a little more affordable. $24 for 2 salads isn't something I could do on a regular basis. But I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Chopt is my new favorite neighborhood spot! The ingredients are abundant, healthy and fresh. I love the uniqueness of the experience- you have someone who prepares your salad (puts all the ingredients in your bowl), then they bring you down to your \"chopper\" who dumps out the ingredients, chops everything up, and if desired, mixes your dressing in evenly. Their go-to line you'll hear at every visit is: \"Is this chopped enough for you?\", kind of like Chick-fil-A people always saying \"my pleasure\" instead of \"you're welcome\". One thing I love is that all the ingredients are pretty measured, so my salad always tastes the same, which is fantastic. My personal favorite is the steakhouse salad (which I sometimes add bacon to). One major tip I have is that once you've had \"the experience\" in-store, don't be afraid to call it in on your next visits! The line gets incredibly long and can take 20+ minutes just to get up to the counter. Generally call-in orders are ready in 15. I've never had an issue with my call-in orders being any less tasty than in-store ordering.",

When you order a salad that you've had multiple, multiple times you expect what you always get. Consistency is key to any successful restaurant. I don't want chicken that taste like a wet dog anywhere near, nor on my salad for that matter.  Cashier was very dismissive and acted like she couldn't care less and shrugged her shoulders as she handed me my second salad, that was still incorrect. Won't be going back to this location. Who lets the cashier deal with a customer issue? If that's the case, at least be kind and understanding. Don't act like your paying customer, who use to be a regular, is inconveniencing you. After all, I had to drive up there twice tonight for both times to be messed up. What a disappointment and let down dinner was tonight. Never got a single sorry. CUSTOMER SERVICE... learn it.",

Build your salad in a assembly line then move to the chopping station.  The chopper will fine chop all of the ingredients to your desired consistency and in the final step will add the amount of salad dressing you prefer. A final toss of the salad results in an easy to eat salad with the perfect mix of ingredients in each bite! The first trip in can feel a little crazy as you are shuffled through the line, but just go where they direct you and it will all work!  Take some time before you get in line to figure out what you want to help relieve the pressure you might feel when ordering. My go to is the Mexican Cesar add avocado and black beans.

I got an iced tea and added lemonade to make an Arnold Palmer. A lot of the items are locally sourced which I LOVED! My friend got a steakhouse salad which she said was great. She added chicken instead of steak because it looked gray and not fresh. She said the chicken was a good substitute. I will be back!",

It appears to be a salad with scant masa chips, 95% chopped romaine and some shreds of chicken.  The dressing is very spicy ( a plus); however, the scant featured ingredients (as stated in the menu) are a tremendous disappointment.  I hope their other menu items are not as deceptive/misleading.",

I now feel like part of the in crowd. I ordered the chicken tinga salad and husband ordered the steakhouse salad with beets added. I liked that they chopped up his salad really fine. I thought they would do that with mine but they didn't. I asked the manager later and he said because the kale is already finely chopped, they don't need to chop the chicken tinga salad, unless the customer asks for it to be. Love the modern decor. Comfortable and cool at the same time. I like that everything is fresh and there is a board on the wall saying where everything comes from. I am really getting into the locavore food scene. Eat local, eat fresh. I just told my 15 yr old that I went here without her and now she wants to go. So I look forward to trying it again. I liked that the cucumber water was free.",

There are many toppings, dressings and meats to choose from. It does get a little overwhelming at first because there's so much to choose from. Personally, I got sick of my salad after eating half of it. It just got too soggy for me and the dressing was overpowering. If you prefer light dressing, you should mention that. I went with one of my friends who isn't a fan of salads and she said she liked it. It's a good experience for anybody who likes or loves salads because you basically get to customize your salad.

    "text": "I reaaaallllyy wanted to enjoy this place.  I'd been craving a chopped salad and we stumbled upon this spot via a yelp search.  Vegan options, too?! Yay!  We ordered two salads and while my husbands spicy cashew soba noodles was the better of the two I was left feeling like we had made a mistake in how we ordered.  I got a Mendocino market salad and originally accepted the dressing the chopper added thinking it would be dressed enough.  My mistake, cool, no problem.  I went and got another side of dressing to add to it - no charge- definitely another plus.  We liked the bread and the salads both tasted okay but mine honestly felt like it was shredding the inside of my mouth.  I'm a salad and veggie fiend - I don't mind a little roughage but something about this really made for a poor eating experience.  I will say the restaurant was beautiful, staff was helpful and friendly - if it was a rating for those factors alone we would be looking at five stars, unfortunately I'll be picking kale out of my sore mouth for a while after the disappointment of a salad.  Edit: I should have been more communicative with the staff on hand about my experience.  Ultimately I decided that the salad couldn't be \"fixed\" within my dietary preferences (keeping plant based - the seasoned meats seemed to be hugely popular with everyone else ordering).  They have reached out to me which I sincerely appreciate and are making an effort to see if this is a problem unique to me or if the salad has any specific issues they need to address.  Thanks, Chopt, for making an effort!",

The bowl is deep but packed to the brim, so it is nearly impossible to mix it yourself without getting salad all over the place.  To be fair, they are swarmed with a ridiculous number of orders during lunch hour, which might be why the salads are not as well-chopped as they should be.

All I know is they have plenty of options, friendly staff, efficient service, and a huge 8 cups full of goodness for around $10.  Plus, I can walk there easily from my home.  I usually get my salad to go; therefore, I always order the dressing on the side so the lettuce stays crisp and fresh until I eat.  There's so much food my wife and I split it between us!

Overpriced and not good, way too sour. The lady burnt my wrap the first time, she had to pick it off the press piece by piece. They told me usually they always burn the first one of the day, ok fair point, maybe could have taken better precaution or test it out in the AM before customers arrive. The wrap by the way are not good. The shrimps were teeny tiny and not fresh. The bacon over powering and the recommended creamy dressing was so sour I feel like I was eating a lemon.   I saw another worker sitting the front of the store eating a takeout from elsewhere, I can't support you if you don't even support your own food, and not even try to hide it, eating it wide open at the front of the store by the windows.",

    "text": "Oh Chopt. I live in Charlotte, NC and go to the Park Road location. I used love this place -- i'm talking would get 3 salads a week and used the online app to get rewards.   Within the last month or 2, some of the Chopt locations have downsized their portions while keeping the price the same. Instead of the clear salad bowls, they are using the same bowls they use for their grain bowls (brown bottom with clear top), which are a good half the size.   After the first time this happened, I just assumed that they'd run out of the clear bowls, but I've been back since and they have in fact gotten rid of the clear bowls and downsized the salads, keeping the high price.   If you inquire about this change on Instagram, you'll get a generic \"please email your questions or concerns here\" -- they will give you a free salad for your complaint, but not really satisfy or answer the actual concerns. If you want a free salad though, just email them and tell them you're disappointed in their bowl downgrades. A free salad is the LEAST they could offer after charging $13 for half the salad they used to give.   Also -- if you go look on Instagram to see if others have noticed this, Chopt is deleting these negative comments -- i've commented twice and  had my comments deleted. So they really are picking and choosing what they want you to see. I don't ever come to Google, but I think it's ridiculous that they are not only ripping off their customers, but they are also lying by omission.   Will not be going back unless the issue is addressed by either a larger portion for the money or they lower the price. A $14 side salad is a little ridic, and while Chopt is delicious, it aint that good.",

Here's what I don't: the staff expect you to know what you want right away because they work fast, so if you don't know or you aren't familiar with the concept, you may be put off. Also, they never use enough dressing for the huge amount of lettuce you get. I always have to ask for more and more dressing and then I feel like I'm a hog. also. Since the portions are large, I have to throw away my salad since it's all mixed together and it doesn't last till the next day without getting soggy.

I am a big fan of Park Rd Shopping center and it's recent face lift of all the storefronts.  There's a lot going on in that shopping center as far as construction and changes - still is a little hard to maneuver due to the 'choice' folks that decide its a great idea to create their own traffic flow.  But I digress.  Chopt is \"sandwiched\" (see what I did there... okay... not that funny) between the big players Rite Aid and Harris Teeter.  It's got some outdoor tables and fairly large indoor dining space.  Tables can be pushed together for large groups.  There are booths too.  The interior is very modern and I'm a fan of the large spice art on the wall.  I don't know if the spices & sauces on the wall are linked to geographic locations where they first originated, but I'll keep staring at it until I figure it out.  Navigate your way through the dining space toward the back where the line starts... AND THERE WILL BE A LINE (just to forewarn you).  I may start coming at an off peak meal time.  Don't get me wrong, the line does move, but I would rather be eating my salad than listening to the person behind me complain about how too many boys are liking her at the moment.  There are a couple of pre-set salads you can choose from, but the ability to customize your salad is probably the way to go here.  I was a noob, so I tried the Mexican Caesar Salad (appears on their \"first time favorites\" section of the menu).  Seems like one person starts your \"base\" as far as the greens and major salad components... then you are shuffled over to a chopping station (1-4) where you wait in line again to talk to your salad finisher.  This is where you add the dressing - \"say when\" and the chopper uses what I would call a sling blade (but it's not really) to chop your salad to whatever consistency you would like.  Once your salad is ready, they scrape it all back into the container and you go wait in the register line to pay for your salad and any other drinks you would like... you can get bread at this step too, but I declined.  I don't even want to see this place during peak lunch/dinner time... it must be crazy... I definitely like this place a lot better than the salad place (similar concept) in Chicago I recently tried since there is WAY LESS yelling... could be the reason why the line doesn't move as fast, but I'd rather keep my nerves and eardrums in check and have a small wait versus the alternative.",

My salad was so yummy, I got it to-go and it didn't even make it back to the office!! I ordered the Palm Beach with shrimp minus the heart of palm but added corn with the Tex-Mex Ranch!! OMG...delicious! I believe this is now my favorite salad shop-stop in Charlotte!! My mother ordered the Santa Fe and she was not disappointed!   The employees were really attentive and very patient, all except one! I asked to taste test 2 different dressings and I could see I needed to hurry and make a decision! Yikes!! I apologized and quickly choose the last dressing that I tasted, which was a good choice!  I really enjoyed Chopt! I can't wait to taste the soup!! I'll definitey be back, I may even order in next time. The atmosphere was very welcoming, spacious and clean!!",

It was almost too overwhelming that I didn't know what to get or where to even start, which is a good thing. There were an endless amount of toppings and options. I could easily eat lunch and dinner here everyday and have different combos each time!  The menu offers a good amount of signature salads that stay the same, 3 destination salads that I think change periodically, and then of course the build your own salad. The BYOS includes 4 toppings and then every one after that is an extra 79 cents. The dressings, OMG, I've never seen so many options!! They put 2 dressing with each salad that you can choose from or you can be adventurous and try your own! Beware, some of the dressings are spicy!   I originally got the palm beach salad but I didn't realize the dressing was spicy. I can usually had me a bit of spice but this was intense so I had to ask for a new one. I tried the Mexican Caesar salad no jalapenos and regular Caesar dressing, omg so good! I loved that they crushed tortilla chips and put them in! Gave it a delicious crunch. My boyfriend got the steak salad-again delicious. All the ingredients were super fresh and perfect!   The only downfall is the price. It can get pricey especially when you want to do add-ons. For two salads, 2 drinks, and 3 add-ons, it came to 30$. I don't know if it's just me but that seems a bit steep for salads. But nonetheless, they were good, I just won't come here as much as I would if the prices were a bit lower.",

At chop you pick a pre-selected combo of salad ingredients, (or pick your own) , pick your dressing, and then they put it all on a board and chop it all up with a big Steel Rocker.    I was impressed when i realized what was happening. I had never had a chopped salad before.  It was nice. Everything was mixed together for optimal enjoyment and favor entswining.

My biggest complaint (which is a good thing for the business) is the line. There seems to always be a long line. This day was no different. The line was right at the door and was about a 15-20 minute wait. Kinda a bummer when you are just trying to get food to go.  The salad topping chooses are abundant. They also don't skimp on toppings...for example, a half an avocado is a serving! In the past, I have tried many of their salads, including some of the hot grain ones. However, this time I just opted to create my own. One of the salads, we got the Mexican Goddess dressing. It is a spicy avocado based dressing that was great. The other salad had the 5 Flavor Asian. Contrary to the name, this dressing was lacking a bit of flavor....ok, alot.   The portion sizes are ginormous. If you are craving salads, you will get it here! My total with a drink came to about $22. A bit on the pricey end considering I didn't have meat in my salads (just veggie toppings and avocado) but the salads are very filling. Opt for a drink, they make some amazing teas and lemonades!",

I then asked for \"dressing on the side\" and he fixed a to go cup of again, Dijon.  I really wanted to make them start over but the place was very busy and I don't dislike Dijon dressing.  The cashier was very impatient.  This experience was a little like Seinfeld's \"NO SOUP FOR YOU!\".  However, the salad is really enough for three decent servings and it really was delish.

Is that too much to ask?   The ambiance is relatively modern and very New Yorky, except everyone there is nice and polite. The menu was surprisingly overwhelming at first, but after some help from the people behind the counter, I decided on the Santa Fe, one of the \"first time favorites\". By the by, that's a really cool thing to put on the menu, basically a default menu for the hopelessly indecisive.   The salad was prepared for me in front of me, I watched them chop it with the coolest kitchen utensil/ninja weapon ever, and then I decided how much of the dressing I wanted. Everything was custom and to my liking.   The taste was phenomenal. The fact that I knew that something that good was that little calories was phenomenal. And I can't wait to go back and try more!   Pro-tip: There is a crack between the window and the small ledge. Beware of dropping things. I dropped my ticket unfortunately and had to get one remade, which was easy enough, but I don't know what would've happened if I dropped my wallet. So..just... be careful.",

Are we really serving hundreds of salads a day at his modern salad joint in a plastic pail that is tossed away. They mention something about \"a better footprint. Each bowl=five recycled bottles\" but it me felt like every person who walked through the door was tossing five bottles in the trash (and This place is busy!!). Just made me kind of sad and I decided unless they begin to serve dine in patrons their salads  in bowl options, I'll skip this place and go to Crisp who serves their salads in a reusable bowl or a to go box.

I thought they were missing some obvious salad options, like pan seared tuna, but mine was tasty. They did mess up my sisters order, forgetting the chicken which was on the bill.   The service was horrid. I can't remember another place where I felt that everyone I encountered deserved to be fired. This included the manager, who approached me when I was about to leave, but then assuming I was going to complain, turned and ran to the back. The turning and running was a common theme; I was waiting for one of the cashiers, who turned to me and asked if she could help, but then left leaving me to talk to thin air. The other cashier was no better. He seemed to be playing a game where he would not answer any questions I asked. Soon I stopped talking, which was the easiest way to avoid frustration. It was odd behavior for human beings; even odder for people in service roles.   My bro in law mentioned a similar experience when he was there several months ago; sadly, it has not improved. So as good as the salads tasted, until there are massive changes, I will not go back",

    "text": "LOVE!! Charlotte has a handful of salad places, but none compare to Chopt. I've been in love with this place since I first ate at a Chopt years ago in nyc, and I was thrilled to hear we were getting one here. It totally lived up to my expectations, and more! The ambiance is clean and fresh. The staff is friendly, and the service is quick. The menu is great. It's not just your regular 3 or 4 types of salads that you add your favorite protein to, but at the same time it isn't overwhelming and complicated. Best of all - they chop up your salad really good - that does make a huge difference in how your salad tastes. The portions are great for the price, and oh to make things even better they source a lot of their produce locally!! Now all we need is a few more locations around town! I had their Kebab Cobb salad, while the hubs tried their New York Street Cart salad. I can't decide which one I liked better. If you love salads, try Chopt, I doubt you will be disappointed.",

Real talk: your first visit here you will probably be overwhelmed. They expect you to be and are prepared to help you navigate the menu and options. You can order one of the featured salads on the menu or build your own. The ingredients are so fresh, the dressings all so delicious. There's also grain, noodle, and quinoa bowl options. I love that Chopt doesn't offer any sodas. They have several brewed in house teas and lemonade type drinks. Oh, and they have the good ice!   This place gets absolutely slammed during lunch. People all the way backed up to the door. Pro tip: skip the line and download the app to order ahead.",

I ordered the Sweet & Smokey Chipotle salad and opted for tofu instead of chicken. I'm choosing vegan options and this was a great substitute also I did the Mexican goddess dressing. Oh and I included the red curry lentil soup, my only pit is their cups should be bigger for $5.50. The cups are quite small especially when you're ordering soup separate and not a half of your meal. But this meal over all was also a great option for my Daniel Fast because it provided Quinoa mixture {grain} so all around I was winning spiritually, healthy, and fully.

The attendant will place all ingredients in a bowl and walk over to a chopping station where someone else will chop the salad in front of you to the bite size of your choice. Once the Salad is chopped up, they will mix in your salad dressing. I also added grilled chicken to my salad, which they chop up as well.  I ordered the southwest salad and was very pleased. I really couldn't distinguish what I was biting into, but sure loved the random chunks of cheese and avocado! Very large servings! I couldn't finish my entire order, but it was so chopped, i don't think it would last before getting wilted in a few hours.   Seating is indoors and they they have a few tables outside too which faces a parking lot. I loved sitting outside soaking up the sun enjoying my salad. I had a Chopt employee come up to my table outside to check if i had everything I needed, which was nice since usually staff ignores you once you walk out of the building if there is no table side service.   I also ordered the lemonade light - nice compliment to the salad I ordered. Overall, I was not left hungry and glad I was able to stuff my face with healthy foods!",

I always get the chicken tinga and they have always chopped and mixed it as well as ask me how much dressing I want mixed in. Today, the female employee put the ingredients in it and then handed it to me without saying a word. I asked her what # do I go to for having it chopped and mixed and she then handed it to another employee and he sort of chopped and mixed it, but did a lazy job of that as I have a solid, hard (not ripe yet) half of an avocado, big tortilla chips, and huge chunks of chicken in my bowl with hardly any dressing. So now I have to find a real knife (not plastic like you get at Chopt) and cut it up myself. Good thing I came home to eat it. This bad experience at Chopt today was so horrible that a fellow customer standing by me saw this and said something as well. I should have asked to speak with the manager. Never had this experience there before and CHOPT is the name of the business. I will give it one more chance, but if this happens again, I won't be going back.",

I love simple, healthy food and have visited Chopt on an almost weekly basis for close to a year. Chicken tinga was my jam and then they changed the recipe and made it a layered salad? Trying to hang in there, I've kept going back but then last week they basically gave me a bowl of rice with a nod to salad. Tonight, they told me they aren't chopping anything anymore and I'm completely confused and disappointed. Management, I've sent several emails via the website, both complimentary and with my recipe change feedback, and have never received a reply. The saddest part, I've noticed a distinct change in the energy and attitude of the team working there. This used to be a buzzing restaurant with a fun staff but not anymore.

When I go in to order, the staff will ignore and not speak to me. Everyone that works there just seems like they do not care. Recently, they changed where to pick up the food when you order online. I haven't been in since then so when I go in the other night and ask the girl at the register all I get is a finger point to the shelf my food was on. No words, no smile, no nothing. Just a point. I'm sorry but I've worked in customer service all my life and you just don't treat people like that and except them to return.   On top of all of the bad customer service experiences and most of my orders being wrong, the salads have become just mediocre. AND they started cutting portions. So now you're paying $13+ for half of a tasteless, probably not made right, salad. It's just not worth it!  Chopt, we had a good run but now we must part.

While making a decision on a \"built\" salad or \"build your own\", the employees here are really patient. I love being able to watch the salad being put together & watching the chopping action go down.  While the salads are a bit pricey, you get so much bang for your buck! I was able to make one salad last me for two meals. I got the steakhouse salad.   Love the design & layout of the restaurant.",

    "text": "After three (3) visits, I can say.... the steakhouse isn't worth it.  The cali green gooddess dressing on it is lovely. It's lime based or acidic and I got it on the side wishing I had it on the greens now.  The lettuce is a romaine & mix. The mix isn't good. Sorry not sorry. Its the truth.  Santa Fe is GREAT withOUT meat.  Kebab Salad is okay. I don't want grilled peppers nor onions so ewwww. Tzatziki sauce is good. The pita chips help make it worthwhile too.   I paid $0.20 more today so IDK if they charged me for the dressing on the side or what.   I'll try the Classic Cobb next.  Why 3 stars? The service is inconsistent and moody.  Sometimes they'll banter and other times, nope! Of 3 visits, I have only been offered the bread ONCE.Even with a manager checking me out but everyone offers a drink. So if you can upsell me a drink then provide my half slice of bread.   NO one mentions - download the app.  5 stars for the cutting and seasonal fruit (pears and apples right now) 0 stars for the flavorless steak 5 stars for the dressing options  0 stars for no raw onions like not red, white, yellow. Zilch. Nien   3 stars for the employees that want to be there.",

I walk up to Chopt and am met with a line out the door. Ugh but I did stay for a minute and watched. Inside was what looked like a well oiled machine cranking along. The line receded as I stood at the door so I decided to take a chance. I found myself in a sparkling and energetic environment. The line progressed a lot faster than I expected mainly due to Henry Ford overseeing the assembly line. This manager was happily going up and down the line answering questions and moving things along. When I made it up to the start of the food prep line, a smiling server was happy to answer more of my questions. I loved watching these hard working people make all these different salads quickly, with precision and apparently with great joy. I mean everyone seemed happy to be working there. That makes a difference to me. And yes, they actually do chop every salad.  The menu is different, interesting, and most importantly, I think that was the best salad I've had in a while if ever. The unusual dressings are very good. I personally really like going to Crisp and I go a lot. Chopt is Crisp on steroids!",

It was my first time doing to Chopt and I heard such amazing things about it so I was excited to try it. My sisters and I walked it in, it smelled great, the decor was beautiful! We grabbed menus and deciding what to order there was an employee that walked past us about 6 time and every single time she passed she asked are we ready yet. We felt rushed and we weren't even in line. We were just reading the menu! The people the served my sisters were great but the girl that did my salad was so rude!!!!! I told her it was my first time there and I didn't know what I was doing she replied \"so are you ready or not\". I started asking questions and every response had an attitude behind it. I asked if I could taste one of the salad dressings and then asked to taste the ranch she replied \"its regular ranch\". I didn't asked what kind of ranch it was I asked to taste it! She said \"are you gonna give me the cup\" She had an attitude for no reason which was not appreciated. She chopped my salad wayyy too much and wayyy to much dressing. It was awful! I also got a Mexican soup of course she described it with \"vegetable soup\" I was fed up at this point. Btw the juices or tea or whatever it is by the door are not good. I called back that night and the manager apologized and sent my a free meal but that is the only reason I am going to go back! I'd rather get a salad somewhere else.",

The atmosphere is great! they have plenty indoor and outdoor seating which is so nice in this shopping center. It does get super busy and loud during the lunch/dinner hours but it is never a long wait. I've never had any problems with any of the employees, they get the job done. I love their fresh raspberry lemonade and their green tea. They also have honey that you can add to sweeten your drinks. To top it all off... they give complimentary bread :)",

The staff were very knowledgeable, friendly, and most importantly patient. Joel was very nice and interacted with customers to obtain feedback. I decided to create my own as I could not decide on one from their menu. I expected it to be bland, but the ceasar dressing was spectacular.  Everything was fresh, the avacado was extra but delicious! It is pricey for a salad, but the overall service was worth it and I kept my cute salad bowl!",

Brandon politely suggested a few salads and stood close by in case I had questions. I explained  that I was in a hurry and decided to leave & go elsewhere when he asked if I knew what I wanted. I told him, he went over to ask another employee, Jo-el to prepare my salad. Within 5 minutes, I had my salad and utensils and was heading out the door. I arrived for my meeting ahead of schedule. The salad was delicious. THANK YOU BRANDON & JO-EL FOR EXCELLENT SERVICE! I will definitely be back.",

It doesn't matter which option you select, all of their salads are fresh and delicious! It's in the Park Road Shopping Center which is a great place to relax and people watch from the outdoor seating! Give it a try! I will warn you that it gets crazy busy at lunch time during the week but you always have the option to call our order in and then pick it up (which is what I usually do).",

    "text": "This review is only for to go orders using the relatively new app. I have used the app about 5 times now and have been very disappointed. Everytime I have used it, my salad has not been ready at the pickup time. This defeats the purpose of using the takeout app. If I wanted to wait for my salad, I would just order in line.  The bigger issue is the quality of the salads when using the takeout app. The salads are rarely chopped and have either no dressing or way too much dressing. I usually get a salad that comes with avocado and everytime I have ordered it, the full avocado is just sitting on top of the salad not chopped or mixed in at all.  It appears to me the quality of takeout salads is much lower than if you wait in line due to the fact that there is someone in the back making them in a half assed manner. I am very happy that they have this takeout option because the line can get pretty long. However, they need to start treating the preparation of the salads in the same manner as if they were making the salad in front of the customer in the store.",

I'll definitely be back during non-busy hours. I can see these salads getting slightly expensive if you get the ones with more \"stuff\" in it, but for the quality and amount you're getting, it's a good deal! Plus, they offer you a complimentary piece of bread. I hope they open up more locations in Charlotte.",

    "text": "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  Even though its a bit of a drive over to Park Road Shopping Center, I try to get to CHOPT at least once a week!  OK, here's the lowdown on everything CHOPT...  If you've never been, just imagine a Chipolte, but for salads and you're good.  Parking shouldn't much of an issue, as this CHOPT location is in the heart of Park Road Shopping Center.  Def one of the busier shopping centers in CLT, but still should be able to find parking with no problem.  I must admit, I don't experiment very much here, so I've never had any of their bowls, or \"Destination Salads\" which seem to reflect the the tastes and foods of a particular region around the world.  I usually run the Classic Cobb or the Santa Fe - usually the Santa Fe.  The main thing you gotta know about the salads is you don't have to accept the bland, boring romaine it comes with!  And why would you, when you can get the CHOPT blend, or the kale, broccoleaf, purple cabbage blend??  I usually run the Santa Fe with half Chopt Blend & half kale, broccoleaf, cabbage w/ chicken (fried or grilled) - DELICIOUS!  There's something addictively good about these salads.      They give you a lot of salad, so I usually don't finish the entire thing at once.   The salads save well in the plastic containers they come with and are great to come back to after cooling in the fridge for a few hours.  Whether you choose to chill and eat it there - they have decent seating available or take it home, the freshness of the food permeates every tasty, crunchy bite!",

I typically order the Cobb salad and then I sub falafel for the chicken, and I exclude the cheese and bacon. This is another reason I like Chopt - make all the modifications you like!",

I Cosby finish the whole thing. It has kale, a great amount of kale,cabbage, tortilla, etc...they chopped it all at your preference. Add the dressing , I chose the chimichurri ranch and it was different and good. Then they add the meat option...you can tell and taste the meat and ingredients are all fresh and organic.

This location looks like it's small (maybe about 10-12 tables in the front), but there are tables in the back that a lot of people don't seem to realize.   Food/Drink: The salads here are very fresh. Last time I ordered I got the Smoky Santa Cruz which consists of: Avocado, Corn, Scallions, Tri-Color Quinoa, Black Beans, Kale, Broccoleaf, and Purple Cabbage with the sweet and smoky chipotle vin and a drizzle of mexican goddess. I don't love scallions, so I swapped them out with rainbow carrots. It was so good! I like to get the dressing on the side - so I felt like I had a really healthy salad. I highly recommend ordering the pre-designed salads. They carry Lenny Boy kombuchas ... which I love -- so big ups for that!  Service: The last time I was in there eating a woman came up to the table to ensure we were having a good experience and cleared our table. She was very sweet. The man who made my salad was very kind too. The girls at the register were a little sassy, but I may have been too after the Saturday they were having (spent 30 minutes waiting in line!)  Price: I recommend ordering the pre-designed salads, you can make swap outs on them and they end up costing much less than if you make your own salad. The last time I was there I ordered a Smoky Santa Cruz and it was about $9.  Notes: I couldn't get over the time at 2PM on a Saturday. It was crazy. I'd suggest 2:30PM or 3PM to avoid the lunch crew. Or order ahead!",

I have yet to get the same salad twice and that's not a bad thing because they have so many choices on top of the monthly specials that it's hard to not want to try something else! They make the salad in front of you so you can always say a little more or a little less of something as they are picking it in. All the ingredients are fresh and the stations look super clean no matter the time you go in. You can change up the dressing or combine two. I usually always get the salad with the spicy dressing so I just cut it with Caesar dressing and it's so good. My first time I was a little overwhelmed but they where ready for me and all my questions.",

I recommend taking a second before getting in line to really read through the menu. The first time you go, it can be a little overwhelming because it's so fast-paced.   Once you choose your salad they'll throw everything in to a bowl and move you down to the \"choppers\". Those are the employees literally chopping up all the ingredients and mixing in the dressing.

    "text": "Chopt salad is just ok. I've been here about a dozen times and my experiences have always been hit or miss. I've complained in the past about getting rotten avocado and being out of white balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  I went tonight to redeem a credit I have on my Chopt app and was reminded why I rarely come here. The employee rushed through my salad and missed multiple ingredients, which I had to point out when my salad was already on the chopping station. The cobb salad comes with bacon, but since I don't eat pork, I always sub it for double avocado. I noticed that my salad had the normal amount of avocado and he had forgotten the egg that comes with it. Thankfully, I asked another nice employee about it and she confirmed I was right about what comes with the classic cobb salad and got the ingredients for me.   I also barely got any panko chicken. They used to give you a few chicken tenders and chop them up for you - now it seems like you only get small pieces that they chop up. They've changed the bowls and salad dressing cups and it seems like you get less food than you got in the past. I guess the new trend is paying more for less food.  I noticed when I left and looked at my app, that had showed that I had $12.71 in Chopt credit while I was in line, only $5 of it had been used, the rest was zeroed out and the rest of the amount was charged to my credit card! I know this is an app issue and not the restaurant, but seriously? That's the main reason why I came!  All in all, it's a decent spot, especially if you're looking for a healthy option, but certainly not somewhere I'd go to regularly.",

They didn't even ask how I'd like the leafy greens and salad toppings, instead poured it into the table and shredded it to pieces and poured out into a bowl. For one big massive mush combo.   The dressings were also only mediocre at best. I got the vinaigrette that was only ok.   At the cash register after you pay, they ask you if you'd like a slice of bread with it. I said yes. It was chewy and nothing special. One taste and I was done.",

Ordering is a bit chaotic - a lot of South Park moms and strollers and business people streaming in and out and waiting in line. However, the \"Quick Casual\" line goes fast and the multiple servers behind the windows help. Great pre-defined options as well as a-la-cart. I had the NY street salad and it was great - lots of rich flavors, great combo of chicken sharma and sun-dried tomatoes, and the hot sauce adds a great touch. Seating is tough during lunch, and I saw a bunch of people getting take-out.  Overall I'll be back but probably to get it to go!",

The sheer simplicity of being able to choose multiple lettuce types inclusive of kale and arugula ...as well as all of your standard run-of-the-mill lettuce options.  2. Unique toppings such as beets & hearts of palm  3. Tons of toppings in all categories like meats, cheeses, etc. 4. Listing of the calories for dressings and other menu items 5. Expansive non-salad menu options inclusive of quinoa bowls and wraps   Less love for .... The huge amount of lettuce. After my salad was \"chopted\" I felt like I could have gotten away with a lot less lettuce but that is just a personal preference. The toppings were very generous indeed.   I really enjoyed Chopt and think it's a great addition to the Charlotte \"salad scene\" and Park Road Shopping Center! :)",

You can also make your own creation but I tend to stick to the options they give (which are a ton)   They also let you try everything without even having to ask. I was concerned the peppers may be to hot but they let me try a few before they put them on the salad so I didn't have to guess if I'd want them or not!   I've had the southwest and the Kebob Cobb. Both were really good. The chopper suggested I mix the two dressings recommended for the salad I got (again let me try her special mix) and it was delicious so I was really appreciative of them taking the time to offer me a unique suggestion I wouldn't have thought of.   I tend to go in off times because I have a feeling it's very crowded at peak times.   The price can be a little high at $10ish dollars for a salad but they are huge and can last for two meals",

That's right - 4. The only place that has the correct phone number for this location is the Chopt website.   2) I ordered the Olympia salad - when my \"chopper\" opted not to chop it, I brought up the point and he told me that salads with grain aren't chopped. Well that seems like an easy fix... Chop the salad then toss in the grains. Maybe I'll suggest next time.   3) I ordered and paid for an Olympia salad with Greek chicken on it. Definitely no chicken in the salad I brought home.   None of this takes away from the fact that I had a great experience and a delicious salad and I will be going back. Just hope that I don't experience any of the above as I'm hoping to put Chopt in my regular lunch/dinner rotation.",

I don't live close to this place but I will make a special trip for these salads!   So my first time going here was rush lunch hour, silly me right? Well that's what I was thinking while walking up to the door and saw a line beginning to wrap around the place. I had to see what all the fuss was about so I waited. The long line gave me some time to decide on what I wanted, or so I thought, the line moves very quickly no matter how long it may seem so I suggest have in mind what you'd like or you might feel a little overwhelmed. They have options for everyone, you can even build your own, choosing from their countless fresh ingredients and dressings. They even have already designed salads that you can choose from as well. After choosing they hand you a ticket and ask you to stand in a chopping line while they fill your bowl with all of your yummy ingredients and pass it down to your designated \"chopper\" who then chops all your ingredients   together  along with your dressing of choice. They make sure  you are getting your desired amount of dressing as well as make sure your salad is being chopped to your desired \"choptness\". The salads are huge and will be sure to fill you up, even have some for later. I decided to try the mexican caesar and the entire salad was amazing if you are a fan of spicy food this one is for you! I also had the California steak house salad which was THE BOMB!! and  will probably be my new go to. You can take your salad to go or you can sit in and eat, there is plenty of seating available and even some in the back for larger groups. I love this place so far the staff is great and very friendly. I will be back!",

When I'm eating a salad, the feeling that you're eating something so good and it's good for you is the hallmark of a winning salad. The addition of depth in the form a grilled or roasted veggies makes all the difference. Have you ever had grilled or roasted veggies over a bed of greens?! Yummmmm! I've found this combination to be the formula for feel good, taste good, and good for you salad. I saw only one roasted veggie, roasted butternut squash was listed in one of the salads. I  hope to see some grilled or pickled veggies offered once the season changes. My salad was one note with very little wow factor. I think the addition of more roasted and grilled veggies would be a game changer.",

I usually go with the Chicken Tinga Salad but recently I went with their new Key West Jerk Chicken Salad and it is absolutely delicious! I highly recommend it as it has a nice little spicy kick to it. The creamy habanero dressing on the salad was just what it needed!  Order online and skip the wait! They put your order on the shelf next to the register. Not exactly the most secure way to get your order as I feel like anyone can come in and grab a bag off the shelf... but luckily I haven't had a bad experience with that!",

And to top it off they always have a flavor of the month menu for bonus deliciousness.   They make the salads right in front of you to your liking and the staff is normally friendly and thorough. I know it costs a bit more than a salad from a place that doesn't specialize in salads but it's worth every penny.   These salads are actually filling. They offer a variety of dressings as well. Even when there's a line Chopt is typically a pretty short wait. The drinks selections are all healthy and refreshing as well.   I thought I wouldn't like Chopt but this comedian J-L Cauvin used to talk about it on his podcast all the time and it made me give them a shot. Podcasts are a great way to learn about stuff. I listen to them all the time and not just all the big named ones. Spread out and try somethings from people who live a different experience than you. You never know what you'll learn!",

I had the good ole cobb and it was perfect. The staff is super friendly too! I really wasent sure what to do and I was guided (not that it's even hard) through the entire process.

After you get all the ingredients you get sent to a personal salad mixer (a worker) who asks you what dressing, and hand cuts/mixes your salad to your liking.  The atmosphere is very relaxing. They have both indoor and outdoor seating (minimal outdoor). The staff would come by and check on us to ensure we didn't need anything throughout our visit as well.  My $10 Cobb salad was PLENTY to fill me up and even take home to have for the following day. Everything tasted very fresh and amazing. I will be back soon!",

    "text": "This was the most intense salad buying experience of my life.   I wish I could end my review there but I know that's not very yelp-ish of me.     This was my first time at a Chopt ever so I didn't know what I was walking into.   When I got there, there was a sign showing where all their fresh ingredients came from, signs over the workers showing the salads, bowls and wraps offered and me, super confused at what direction I was going to go in as I couldn't see the options for make your own and I didn't want to be that person during dinner rush that didn't know what they wanted or how to make a \"chopt\" salad.    So I went with the Mexican Vegan.  The guy who put my salad together in a bowl then said \"follow me if you want to survive\" ( just kidding, he didn't say follow me).  He raised his arm and said \"line four\" and he walked all the way down to the other side of the counter, dropped my bowl of salad in another line of bowls of salads and went back to making other people's bowls.    At this point, I'm in another line, although this one is perpendicular to the counter and you come face to face with the CHOPPER. Mwahaha.  This person is a person whose job it is to murder your hand crafted bowl of greens til your sadist heart is content with how cut everything is.    I bought my bowl back to my hotel room where I finally could try this magical salad and....it was alright.  I think it was more that I went with the mexican vegan which is totally on me.  I ate 3/4 of it and didn't feel like I could finish it yet I was still hungry.  This is a feeling that this food loving girl doesn't like or understand!   I would pick a different salad next time but overall, I think it's an interesting place and an unique experience.",

    "text": "Finally got to try Chopt for the first time! I promise I don't live under a rock...  I did learn why it's called Chopt. If you've ever been here before you know why. After making your salad, they use this special tool to \"chop\" your salad more finely. Say goodbye to awkward salad eating (you know the big bites of lettuce etc you have to fit in your mouth, may or may not get some on your cheeks). Nope, not here! It's easy to eat, literally! Not to mention it tastes sooo good!   Lots of options to order, or build your own. All ingredients tasted so fresh and delicious. I had the chicken tinga which is one of their warm salads (has warm quinoa & chicken). I like that they asked if I wanted everything on there that normally comes with that salad. I said no peppers please. Then they ask which Ingredient instead! Score. So I choose a boiled egg. At no additional cost.   They do not offer sodas. Healthy here! They do have their own lemonades and teas which all sounded grand. I normally have water but splurged on a mint lemonade, and it was very refreshing!   Lunch time gets busy here! Place is nice inside. There's a bigger room at the end of the hall that's kind of hidden so if you go and it's packed. Have no fear, there's more places to sit! I enjoyed their interesting wall paper in this back room. It's surfers. But on vegetables instead of boards. Catchy!   Overall great:yummy experience. Just pricey for a salad so giving 4 stars. (Average $10 a salad I'd say)",

I definitely recommend ordering online beforehand to skip the line.  All the ingredients I've ever selected from a salad here have been great and I can't really recall a bad bite. The only thing I wish they would do is dress the salads a LITTLE bit more. However, I always end up grabbing a dressing on the side to make the salad a little bit better for me, and that always works out.   Overall, very yummy and I will continue to come back here.",

    "text": "I adore Chop't. I always frequent when I'm in DC, and I'm thrilled to have one now in Charlotte. The day I tried it, I was wowed by the friendliness of staff, the clean/modern/comfortable interior and the taste of the salad. I was a little disappointed in the pricing and the lack of availability of several of my choices (falafel, falafel crisps). I would've chosen the Falafel Cobb, but due to the lack of falafel, I built my own with a mix of greens, fried onions, avocado, blue cheese and feta with the Mexican Goddess dressing. It was heavenly, but definitely a pricey salad at over $10 (and no meat). Note that the avocado is a $1.99 upcharge. :/  I will be back, but I think the pre-designed options offer a better deal (for more toppings for the money than a make-your-own).",

The staff greeted us as we walked in and approached the counter. Extremely friendly staff.   My husband ordered the Cobb salad and I ordered  the 7 summits with chicken.  OMG, both were delish and quite filling.   My husband really enjoyed watching the chopping part. He committed how fast the overall process was. He even committed on how friendly the staff was.   We will definitely be return customers.",

    "text": "As a transplant New Yorker I appreciate this restaurants city style approach to fast casual. When everything is flowing it's a very efficient ordering process. My only complaint is that the layout of the restaurant itself prohibits the flow of customers. Often when busy, those waiting at a chopping station are in the way of those waiting to order. The process and its capacity for confusion has definitely turned off some of my friends to the restaurant, including my fiance. But I'm a huge fan never the less.   The food is delicious every time. My favorites are the two warm grain salads the braised Greek and chicken Tinga. I love the dressing offerings. I often get the Mexican goddess or the lemon tahini, tzatziki, and a squeeze of lemon or lime.   Ive also tried and liked lots of the specials - like the NYC street cart. Hope that one comes back around!   I can't go in without coming out with one of their lemonades I usually mix the unsweetened green or black tea with their  regular or raspberry lemonade for a tasty Arnold Palmer.   Also if you download the app - you can get a free meal after spending $100. Doesn't take long to add up.",

    "text": "And the angels rejoiced! Finally Charlotte has a really great salad place!!! (Sorry, the holidays must be getting to me.) I can't say how impressed I am with this place and the management. Yes it takes 2x the people to make my salad than really needed. But the selection, quality and flavors makes the process totally worth it. They have a wide variety of flavor profiles and I love that they detail all calorie counts regardless if you have an add-on chicken, walnuts or Caesar dressing. I love the Mexicali Vegan Salad (360 cal) with add-on chicken breast and Sweet and Smoky Chipotle!   But what particularly impressed me is their attention to detail. I had asked my salad maker if the falafel had coriander or cilantro in it and she asked the manager. The manager came over and figured out immediately that I was allergic and started warning me about a bunch of different ingredients (avoid tabbouleh and southwestern quinoa) and even had my \"chopper\" (which reminds me of fluffer - heh heh) remove his whole chopping station equipment and bring in new because the middle-eastern chicken is marinated in coriander and he was worried about the juices. That is an unnecessarily detailed boring story but I was blown away by the precautions they took for little ol' me- it was totally unprecedented. So anyone else with allergies should definitely feel safe there. Bravo for your attention to the customer!   I will be a frequent customer and I hope they open up other locations or buy out Crisp!",

Everything else tasted very fresh.  Finally--flavorful salad dressings that don't make up 25% of a salad's calories.  Not as good as my favorite salad in Charlotte--Big Apple Deli's Greek salad with grilled chicken (huge portion for $8)--but worthy of putting in the lunch rotation.",

It's hard to find good help these days and especially one who is willing to assist without being told!  Just a great worker with good work ethics!  Good old customer service that's long been erased!  Give that guy a raise :-)  His Mother taught him well!!!!!!!  The salads are good too!  Thanks Chris......We're not first timers and it certainly won't be our last time.....We'll be back!",

I want to branch out but I have literal cravings for this one. Charlotte is big enough for two great salad places and with the amount of bad food I put in my body, I am glad there is now another delicious healthy option.",

    "text": "My first trip to Chopt was stellar, not just because my salad was delicious, but mainly because of the service and experience.   The restaurant was clean and the servers were smiley. The set up was easy and convenient. Just go through the line to either order one of their specialty salads or you can build your own by selecting from an array of fresh toppings - veggies, fruits, meats. All the toppings looked fresh and fantastic.  Since I was a first timer, I was unfamiliar with the process and didn't know what to expect. I chose to create my own salad. Whenever I eat a salad at a restaurant, I typically get the salad dressing on the side. However, since the server was mixing the dressing in with the salad, rolled with it so I could get the full experience. So the server started pouring the dressing and asked me to tell him when to stop. When I told him him to stop, he started mixing the salad and it looked a little dry to me so I told him to add a little more salad dressing.  I sat down and started eating my salad and low and behold, it ended up being too much dressing! Please note: this was all my fault! I told the server to add more dressing and he simply did as he was told.   Since this was my mistake, I attempted to continue eating the salad but the dressing was just overwhelming.  Suddenly this sweet man walks up to ask me if I was enjoying my meal. Turns out it was the manager ~ Cole. I told him how good everything was but that I added too much dressing. Cole quickly told me that he wanted me to have a great first experience at Chopt so without hesitation he offered to get me another salad for free. But he didn't stop there. He walked with me through the line, talked me through the process, pointed out some additional vegetables to try, and made sure I got the perfect amount of dressing. My new salad was just right.  This experience might not sound like a big deal to some but to me it was everything! I mean what customer doesn't like to feel valued and special and that's exactly how Cole made me feel.   Please go check out Chopt. You'll love the food and the service! I'm looking forward to going back.",

While it's a little pricier compared to the all-you-can-eat salad bar I can get across the street at Jason's Deli, Chopt offers a unique concept.  You pick the salad you want from their menu (or build your own) and then you're taken to one of the chopping stations with your designated chopper.  You watch in amazement as the chopper pulls out a machete-looking tool and goes to work on your salad.  You can have them chop it as much or as little as you want.  I stopped somewhere in between with my Cobb Salad.  I then opted for the healthier Greek yogurt tzatziki dressing instead of my normal blue cheese one, which turned out to be delicious, and I didn't even notice the difference.    It was pretty crowded inside and out, but we found a nice table right along the window, so we got to enjoy the sunshine.  The salads were sized \"just right\" for me, and it was fresh and tasty.  I'll definitely be back, but I wish their salads were priced a little bit lower for me to return more often.",

It's also about $12.50 a person for a salad and a drink so I just get water most of the time now.   There are many different salad choices and you may feel overwhelmed and you can always create your own salad as well which seems even more overwhelming as you get close to the front of the line and have to make decisions but that's probably a personal problem of mine.   I've had the chicken kabob salad and the Steakhouse. The Steakhouse is only 320 calories and I go light on the Steakhouse Blue Cheese dressing which says 120 calories but that's probably the hard part is to do determine how many servings worth they are putting on as they wait for you to say when. Of course you can get it on the side but that seems to defeat the purpose of the great work the salad preppers do for you.   After you've been through the process once you will get it but you start at the front with your order. The first person hands you off to one of 4 salad stations where you wait on line behind others as they make the salads. Then you take your salad and pay.",

Pro tip: if you know you're going to go there often, go ahead and download the app. Spend $100 and get a free salad or $10 off (Don't quote me on that though). Trust me it is not hard or take a long time to spend $100 at Chopt lol. AVOID I repeat AVOID going there during lunch time... or you'll end up spending your entire lunch break in line (speaking from experience lol) Cutting the line by ordering through the app and earn some points lol #winwin",

The more I can customize it, the better I like it.  Chopt really takes salad to a new level.  They have a bunch of different types of lettuce, from romaine to kale, and feel free to mix/match two different kinds.  They also have a ton of toppings, from your standard cucumbers and tomatoes, to soba noodles and cotija cheese.  They also have a huge variety of dressings, so you can be as good or bad as you want on the calories.  There is one thing that stands out, and that's the destination salads.  If your'e one of those people that walks in and orders the same thing every time, I encourage you to try out one of their own creations.  They put some inventive combinations together so salad will never be boring to you again.  Tip from a pro.  If you pretty much know what you want, order your salad through the Chopt app!!!  Not only will you sip the ridiculous line that never seems to die down at any point in time during the day, but you can just pick up your salad and eat it there if you don't want it to go.  You can also earn Chopt points through the app!  The only downside is that you can't stand there and try different dressings/toppings.  You've gotta know what you want.  I absolutely love this place, so yes, I will be back again and again and again.  I probably wouldn't recommend this place if you're starving and need instant food gratification.  Save that for a drive-through.  If you want to just get a really good lunch or dinner made your way, Chopt is a great place to go.",

There is an assortment of fresh fruits, veggies , cheese/dairies, grains , proteins , and even crunch for a True salad artist . Also , for the avid meal preppers , calories are included for each menu item . I love the assortment of dressings as well they have your all time favorites , speciality Chopt mixes , or some low cal options they call \"Spa\" dressings .   The menu doesn't display the specials for each location , but if you want something with a little more weight , Chopt also has \"Salad sandwiches\" , pitas, side snacks , etc in store .  The pricing can get a little expensive for a salad but the quality and selection is definitely worth it.",

It will go quick!  Chopt offers so many options and toppings. I've never done the quinoa bowls, so I can't speak to those. I've only ordered salad. I love that you mix and match any of the lettuces and toppings. You can always get one of their standards blends (I recommend the Santa Fe if you like spicy, tex-mex salads).   The only reason I rate Chopt 4 Stars is that I do feel like it can be pricey. I love avocado, which is an extra $2! The Santa Fe, sans fried onions + avocado, runs around $11. The nice thing is that it does last about 1.5-2 meals!  I do highly recommend Chopt and will definitely be back!",

I had to ask for them to even put it in the bowl to mix it up because they claimed it was pre-chopped already. It neither tastes nor looks the same.

    "text": "Love the idea of this place!!!!!  There are plenty of topping options for the build-your own salad. They also have set salads that you can choose from. They were really nice about granting substitutions for pre-listed salads for free.  Overall the service of the individuals who were preparing the salads was great, they were all very patient with us first timers and had great conversations as they chopped our salad which made the experience enjoyable.   The two cons are that  (1) the cashiers had horrible attitudes, and were very inconsistent with their offerings, as on offered the person in front of me bread, but completely forgot to offer it to me. (2) the salads are a bit pricey, but hey, your paying for the experience right!!",

    "text": "Go for the Destination Salad choices - they are on the menus only for a couple months and often offer the most unique approaches and flavor profiles to salad making that set Chopt apart. I love that they post calorie counts for everything, making it easier to make the choice to be smart or indulgent. Don't overlook their soups, which also change seasonally and so far have all been excellent. The one annoying thing is they always ask how much dressing I want as they apply it and all I really want is what the \"normal\" amount is for the calorie count displayed. Sometimes the pressure of so many choices (\"is this chopped enough?\", \"how much dressing?\", \"do you want any different ingredients than what is listed for your choice?\") becomes overwhelming.  I think the flexibility to ask for it differently is great but the pressure they place on the fast moving line is a turn off.",

Kale, corn, black beans, grilled chicken, quinoa, cabbage with a little Mexican goddess and smoky vinaigrette. Also the vegan options are amazing as well. One of my top 5 places in Charlotte to have an actual healthy affordable meal.",

    "text": "When I heard this restaurant was opening I did my research first and discovered they are a chain and this was their first Charlotte location. So being that I'd rather support locally owned businesses I was reluctant to try this place.  What brought me in here is I was looking for something to take home after running an errand and didn't want the usual sandwich or fast food places.  They have printed menus near the door so I'd recommend picking one up so you can peruse while you are standing in line. The line starts at the back of the restaurant. Someone takes your order and they had you a sheet. That person gathers all the ingredients in your order and then passes them on to someone down the line who chops your lettuce and mixes everything in your salad. Then it's stuffed in a clear plastic bowl in a rather unappetizing way. Then on you go to pay and get your drink.  Like one other reviewer mentioned it's a rather chaotic process. Seems a bit disorganized at times and it's very loud in there so you can barely hear the person making your salad.    For my salad, I went with one of the First timer recommendations - the Santa Fe salad which comes with Avocado, grape tomatoes, corn, pepperjack, fried onions and romaine. It sounded appetizing but what I received was not. It looked and tasted like a lot of mush. The high point was the spicy Chipotle vinagrette.     I can't say if I will come back or not, especially when there's a locally owned salad place up the street. But who knows, I may end up here again for the convenience to try something beyond the first timer recommendations.",

    "text": "This was my boyfriend's favorite restaurant in Charlotte before he relocated. I still hear the occasional \"I miss Chopt!\" That was the first place I took him when he came back for a visit. I hope it grows to more locations!   The process is very simple, and the staff is always generous in offering a substitute ingredient if you don't want something included in a certain menu item's make-up. They always chop and add dressing to the customer's satisfaction. Also, the bowls the salads come in make them very portable if you are on the go.  The whole set up makes it really easy to eat vegetarian, which I appreciate. Also, their lemonades are perfect. They sweeten with honey instead of sugar, and it's the best I've ever tasted.",
