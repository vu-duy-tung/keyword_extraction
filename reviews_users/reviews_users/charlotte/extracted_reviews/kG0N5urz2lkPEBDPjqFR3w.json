    "text": "Although hubby and I eat Indian food everyday at home...we were craving North Indian fare which I rarely get around to making at home. We went on a Saturday night...it wasn't packed so we got seated right away. Most of their patronage are non Indians which often means that the food is good but not spicy. Hubby and I are huge fans of spicy food as I've mentioned in previous reviews. Hubby got the Chicken tandoori and I got the chicken vindaloo (which is supposed to be spicy) and is a Goan speciality...something I am very familiar with :o) When the waiter came by hubby and I asked him if he could make these dishes spicy. He looked at us and asked \"Indian spicy\" and we both grinned away and said absolutely. And they delivered! The flavors were great and it satisfied our spiceometer. The only thing is would say is the vindaloo could have been a bit more sour. The tandoori chicken was moist and yum. But the highlight had to be the garlic naan. They didn't go cheap on the garlic and the naan was soft and delish!! Service was polite and fast. and then thew in some extra butter chicken sauce even though we didn't order any. Sooooo goooood.  We will be going back when we get cravings for Indian AND spicy food!",

That said, I have patronized this business at least 5 times with consistent experiences. The food is decent Indian food at a convenient location. The customer service however has been lacking each and every time. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was my entrance to the establishment today. As I approached the door, there was a server standing there who clearly saw me coming in. Instead of opening the door or at the very least, remaining to greet me, he turned and walked away. Once I entered there was no warm welcome (which I should not have expected given previous visits) but instead, I was rushed through to determine if I would stay for the buffet or if I was there to pick up takeout. I won't belabor the point, I will just reiterate that this was my last time spending money in a restaurant that does not appreciate my business. Their customer service is seriously lacking and the food is good at best but certainly nothing special.",

I have to agree with other reviewers that the curry is VERY mild. We asked for them to be a bit spicier than they might normally make them, and they were still very mild. Good, but mild. However, the veggie samosas are mind-blowing! Spicy and smooth and not greasy at all - highly recommended. The kheer was also really yummy. Spicier (cardamom and nutmeg spicy, not hot spicy...) than I've had in the past, but good. Go for the garlic naan as well, delish! The only negative that I can think of is you don't get all of the free \"extras\" (a pekora to start you out or some kheer and chai at the end) you get at some other places, but I haven't heard of anywhere in Charlotte that does, so I guess it's an even playing field. Good wine selection, good food, good service.",

I ordered dinner: Paneer Makhani (requested spicy, but could have handled much more), lamb samosas, and garlic naan.  It was absolutely delicious.  Perhaps it's just the lunch buffet that isn't up to snuff?  I found my experience (and food!) to be the BEST in Charlotte - and I've tried every single one of them.  I strongly recommend.  Enjoy!",

I think as a takeout it would be ok.   it is probably actually a 2.5 but more of a two reaching for a three than a three sliding.    food itself was probably a 3.5",

We have ordered chilly chicken for appetizer and the chicken was under cooked and had a lot of soya sauce in it. That was a disaster , because my friend asked the waiter and he said it was the best chicken appetizer. Then we have ordered the murgh biryani, garlic naan and kadhai murgh. The naans were fine, the chicken in the curry and biryani were very big and were undercooked. The biryani tasted more like a pulav which is not acceptable to a hyderabadi like me. The kadhai chicken had some tomatoes which were undercooked. They turned off the music and the lights while we were still having our dinner at 10:45 pm, which is not at all a good customer service. Finally this is a place to avoid if you are looking for good food.",

The buffet was tasteless and not at all worth the 12.95. To begin with, the butter chicken was no where close to what it should taste. Boneless chicken means good quality of cubed chicken and not chicken thighs less the bones. The tandoori chicken was burnt and the chicken curry was just terrible. The vegetables fanfare was another waste. Twice I asked for mango lassi which is supposed to be offered free with the buffet but till the end it did not show up. I am sorry but the food was an insult to Indian/Pakistani cuisine. Not worth a visit.",

My partner and I have consistently experienced major gastro distress for a few days after eating here, even when there was zero spice. Delivery, dine-in, buffet, it's across-the-board questionable.  The flavor is so-so or downright bad more often than good (85% bad), and sometimes the chicken is rock hard. That combined with the--erm--potential consequences of major throne time have led us to give this place a serious break.  (previous review) This is a review of the Saturday Indian lunch buffet. There was a decent selection, although mostly chicken, but the food was just okay. It honestly lacked flavor and could have been hotter (temperature), which was a real disappointment. My partner and I love Indian food and when we seek it out we're looking for a major flavor kick, but this just felt \"okay but bland.\"   Waiters brought a small basket of naan to the table, and we had to ask for extra, which didn't come before the end of our meal. The naan was also flavorless, kind of like low grade white bread without any zip. I wondered if they make it on site or if it was delivered frozen (the naan from Costco is better).  It was also hard to get water refills, which were swift at the start but then slowed to no-refill-for-you. Parched!   Maybe dinner or made to order meals are better, but we're going to keep trying other places before we would head here again.",

After leaving and dissapearing for another 10 mins, he finally came back and gave us the full discount. The owner never came out with explanation or apology.   As someone working in customer service field, I'm appalled by their treatment of patrons and will never step a foot in their establishment and intend of telling others the same thing.

Maharani is slightly more expensive than Situl and Passage to India, but not by much. Veggie dishes start at 12, meat dishes at 15.

I went with the standard chana masala with medium spice. Sadly, it didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. I know it's a pretty simple order, but it tasted really plain. The wife ordered the vegetable jalfrezi and it was a better choice, plus it had veggies whereas the chana masala is just chickpeas. The carnivores seemed to enjoy their meals, so all in all it was a good meal. Just not my favorite.  Fun little game....I challenge you to try to get your water glass more than half empty before they refill it. It's not going to happen.",

I am giving them two stars solely based on the fact that their menu looked pretty good and this is one of the only fairly priced Indian places in Charlotte.  The main reason I am giving them a low rating is that we came to the restaurant on a slow Thursday night. When we walked to the other room where a bunch of tables are, we saw 5-6 open tables. Our host proceeded to seat us at a small two person table right within the arch of the entry way. When we asked if we could sit in one of the open tables, we were declined. Normally I would grin and bear it, but the attitude of the host/waiter left a bad taste in my mouth. To be honest, I may be sticking with Situl for my Indian needs from now on.",

The interiors were clean and looked well maintained and we thought that it was going to be a fine experience.. that was till we got to the buffet.. we noticed that some of the dishes were half empty and the naan dish was nearly empty.. still, we proceeded to eat, with caution, before realizing that the food was indeed old. The rice was hard and plastic, the naan was hard as a rock, chicken was hot outside but cold on the inside, channa masala tasted stale and old.. when we made the owner/manager ( Mr. Singh) aware of this, he said it was because the water they use to keep the food warm at the buffet was too hot.. he did bring us fresh rice to try but we didn't risk it.. we just chose to leave the place instead and find another place to get some food.. at the checkout, the manager said he was taking $1 off each of our buffets, but we were just happy to be getting as far away from that place as possible. Finally, the guy had the gall to ask if we were Telugu or Tamil in a very insulting manner as though that's the only reason why we didn't like the food.. after serving old, stale and potentially unhealthy food, cheek is the last thing we expected from that place/manager.. please stay away!!!",

    "text": "The reviews seemed to be hit-or-miss, but I decided to take a leap and try it out. I hadn't tried any Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area, so I went ahead and ordered several take out dishes to try. It might be important to note I'd had a huge curry craving for months. Maharani, while it definitely hit the spot, was lacking in a few areas.  I called in the order and then went to pick it up. It was very straightforward and simple. They had the food ready exactly when they said they would. The servers and cashier were very friendly and courteous.  I tried the plain naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and mutter paneer. I even found some papadum and mint sauce wrapped up in my bag, which was nice. For some reason, having the papadum feels nice and familiar. The naan was alright, but not as fluffy as I had hoped. It was crispier in a lot of places, and I think it just needs to be a bit thicker. The chicken in the tikka masal was very good and very moist (yes, I know a lot of people hate that word. It's a good word to use in this case!). The vindaloo was decent, except that the chunks of meat and potato were enormous. I was taught to eat Indian food by a Sri Lankan, which means I eat with my hands. I'm not used to having to pick up a giant wedge of potato and figuring out how to eat it cleanly. The mutter paneer was also alright, but the paneer was kind of tough and not soft like I'm used to.   Like I said, it hit the spot, but I wouldn't order the vindaloo again, and I'm iffy on the paneer. Maybe it needs to be more fresh? I don't know how paneer works. The biggest issue was the salt level in the food. There was WAY. TOO. MUCH. SALT. If you are one of those people who loves to add salt, then this is all for you. I will give it another try, but only if they might agree to ease up on the salt... a lot.",

Came here for the lunch buffet on a Friday, this place was packed!  Normally, I'd be put off by the masses, but this just meant the buffet items were frequently replenished with fresh ones.   $9 for all you can eat Indian food is a great deal.  There were 4 vegetarian dishes (yay!!!) and 2-3 chicken dishes. There was also jasmine rice, naan, sauces, salad, and rice pudding.  The food was good, but not great. It was tasty, but nothing amazing. It just didn't seem to be prepared with love and tedious care like I'm accustomed to at Woodlands. The naan was good, but not fluffy and not melt in your mouth like I prefer.   The service was mixed. The hostess and one other staff were a little cold and off-putting.  But I had another staff who was so sweet and kind and accommodating (brought my friend and I an extra pitcher of water because we were wicked thirsty).  FYI - There's a BOGO coupon in the Charlotte Citipass book, but it doesn't apply to the lunch buffet.",

Well, quicker than the place I order from in Atlanta.  That place is snail-like.  But we drove over there, BF went in to pick up the food, and was back in two minutes.  NIce.  Food was very good too!  We ordered samosas for an app, chicken curry, chana masala, and an order of naan (total: ~$32).  All was good.  They included a couple of different sauces than the ones I've seen served with Indian food before.  One was a flourescent green color, the other was a brown, sweet sauce.  Wasn't really sure what these went with.  I'd like to try out actually going to the restaurant, but, I'm fearful that I will leave the restaurant smelling like curry when I leave, as this is the smell that wafted in as the BF came back to the car.  So be advised.",

    "text": "I'm still trying to learn my way around Indian Cuisine, and so far I'm still on the fence.  Today we went with a friend who was a fan of their lunch buffet.  I thought it was a great way to try out more foods.  Still, nothing rocked my world.  While I couldn't tell you the names of all the foods (if I really LOVED something it might be different), I know I did like the peas dish, which I believe from looking at their menu is the mutter paneer?  I also see the dish is $12.95?  For peas and cheese?  At least I know that I CAN eat a variety of Indian food if I go to another restaurant.  As for the service, while it was very quick, it got to be a little bit uncomfortable as the waiter was hovering in the dining area right by our table, ready to grab our plates as soon as we cleared them.  Not a bad experience overall as it it's fun to try new foods, but nothing a crave to go back for.",

A quick stop for lunch on the way to the theater provided enough nourishment to keep me from filling up on popcorn!  It was good...the butter chicken, the aloo tikki were very good. I was slightly disappointed with the watery tamarind sauce.  I love the sauce when it has a thicker consistency.  The service was sub-typical for buffet.  Not once did the wait staff ask if all was OK...or if we needed anything else.  OK...I am spoiled by better service....but you have to expect it when you are out at a restaurant.  It makes you feel like you are having lunch or dinner where you are really appreciated.",

The food was pretty good though  I don't know the names of the dishes, but suffice to say, everything was coated in a spices and moderately spicy.  Perfect for the American palate, I guess.  The butter chicken was top notch, the curries decent, and the basmati rice was a little dry, but tasty nonetheless.  The buffet food could have been a little hotter.  The service was quite creepy and brings the rating from 4 to 3 stars.  I had several servers passing by my table repeatedly with the hands folded and scanning the room with their eyes.  When I asked for a water refill, they seemed quite aloof.  Is this normal?  They did, however, refresh the basket of naan quite frequently.  Who can diss hot bread?  For a hearty $11 lunch buffet, I might return if invited by a friend.  As a novice of Indian food, I'm intrigued by what I ate and yet something tells me that there's more to be desired.",

Copper is definitely still my place, but Maharani was fine enough. First of all, the food came very quickly, which is rare. Usually indian food, good indian good, takes at least 30-45 minutes. We got our order in like 30, which was great 'cause we were starving.   The Tikka Masala was spicy and pretty good, but it wasn't as thick and saucy as i like. The salad was just so-so. The Naan were all amazing. Definitely the highlight.",

My boyfriend was so disgusted by the food he never wanted Indian again until I got him to agree for a buffet, I knew if I ever wanted Indian food dates again I needed to bring him over here for redemption. He loved all the food, especially the butter chicken and spicy rice. He's also big on water refills and can down maybe 6-7 cups and they were on top of keeping our drinks refilled. I can't wait to come back. Thank you for consistent amazing service.",

The lunch buffets are a delicious way to sample dishes for the first time and at dinner, you can order them as an entree.  Neither decor nor the shopping center is anything great but it is affordable space for this family to showcase their food.   I have recently tended to get Indian from more of the trendy or modern places offering Indian.  While it is nice to have more exposure to Indian at these newer sometimes prettier spots, the food isn't as intensely flavorful as Maharani.  Also, on the buffet,  don't skip the mango custard or Kheer.  It is a sweet ending to a delicious meal.",

We also ordered some garlic naan. Nothing too special about it but a nice addition to the meal! I liked to dip my naan in the tikka masala sauce.

Their Garlic Naan is amazing. Always piping hot with just the right amount of garlic.  I even love the subtle burnt end sometimes. As for the chicken, it is good, but the spice level has varied ever time, and they have never asked how I would like it.  I have never been disappointed with the chicken, white chucks of tender white chicken served with rice.   I hope to dine in soon, but not sure about hitting the buffet. Not sure I'll be venturous enough to try some of the items. We'll see though, as I love to give things a try.",

    "text": "I am giving this place a four star review because of their hours, their menu, the fact that it is a family owned restaurant, and the fact that everything I have had has been good.   If you go, though, be aware that you need to communicate well. The waiters don't slow down or enunciate enough for my stupid American ears. So listen carefully and be sure to be thorough in what you want. I mumble, they mumble, and then you may get Lamb when you wanted Chicken, like my husband got. Still tasty and we didn't really care that the meat was different since we like to try new things. The wait staff doesn't fawn all over you, but they are perfectly fine and I haven't had trouble flagging a waiter down.  They are open when other Indian restaurants are closed. I would love to try more Indian in the area, but this place seems the most convenient for us. The menu is very substantial and much clearer than other Indian menus, so you get to intelligently experiment.   I have had the Murg Tikka Masala (what you get if you don't know what to order because you know it'll be great), the Murg Vindaloo (spicy but has more flavor variety and some potato), the Murg Lajwab (a mango ginger dish). Murg means Chicken, ya'll. All were great and I had enough to bring home leftovers. An entree is about 11-15 dollars. We always get the Garlic Naan, and it's only a couple bucks.   Usually when I order something spiced \"hot\" the restaurant assumes I don't know what I want and they serve it much milder than I want (....this happens at every wings place I ever go to). Maharani will serve it HOT. So hot, that I may need to order it medium-hot next time. I just ordered a side of Raita (yogurt-cucumber condiment) to stop the burn.  They have a buffet 12-3 on Sundays that I intend to check out since I can't make their weekday lunch buffet. Nothing like an Indian buffet. Yum!",

The first time was a super blunder, as in - we ordered chicken biryani I guess (it was long time ago) and I saw corn in it.  I mean, corn in a biryani come one that so anti - Indian way of making biryani.  It obviously altered the taste of the supposedly heavenly aromatic biryani. Another time we ordered some butter chicken and Naans, it was ok.  Something was missing in the spice rack but I am not able to find out what it exactly missed.

They serve a buffet at lunch that has 6 - 8 options on it - they're all good, if a little bland.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the food while I'm eating it, it just doesn't blow me away.  It's as if Maharani is being a little stingy with the flavor...  I also occasionally grab take-out from here.  I like to order the Palak Paneer (creamed spinach with chunks of paneer cheese) and the chicken or shrimp tikka masala.  The naan is always hot - but again, just a little lacking in flavor.  The take-out portions are quite large - we always have leftovers if we order 2 entrees and an appetizer (for two people).    Overall, Charlotte doesn't have a huge variety of Indian restaurants - this serves the purpose.     I would like to see a bit more flavor, but I will continue to eat here.",

The service was five star, very very good. The ambiance was great also. Perfect for a nice date. The samosas we got were really yummy, but Kahdai Murg and Aloo Matar were not very flavorful which is sad to say about Indian dishes. We ordered the medium hot.

I think they do tag-team service so really everyone is your server. I've only had dinner there, so I can't speak to their buffet. The environment might appear more formal than you'd expect but it's really because they use nice, white tablecloths.   They have a dedicated vegetarian section which I SO appreciate. I'm a sucker for the korma. Their vegetable samosas are delicious. The vegetable masala is also good. And of course, you always have to get naan! Their portions are decently sized so if you're not really hungry, you can expect to go home with a box of food.",

We were offered to order off the menu or get the lunch buffet.  We both opted for the lunch buffet.  Kathleen and I both filled our plates with a smattering of a variety of dishes, including the naan.  On the way back to the table with my full plate, I took a bite of naan.  It tasted oily and nothing like the tasty naan I had experienced at other Indian restaurants. I almost had to spit it out. As far as the rest of the food, Kathleen and I both agreed it was very average.  If we were writing a letter home, we would not mention this lunch experience.  But, I will say that the mango custard with the rice pudding over it was the star of the show.  For starters, this restaurant needs a paint job and some better naan.  That would make a big difference in anyone's experience here.",

I went while I was hungry hadn't eaten all day and finally got off work at 6pm and stopped in, so that says something being as everything taste good when your hungry. I told the server I wanted medium spice literally brought it out and it was mild. I told them it had no flavor and I need some garam Marsala, some spice , whatever they had to make it better and they immediately fixed what they could of it. It taste better than it did when they first brought it out but I won't be back. I cook better Indian at home and I'm not even Indian.",

The lunch buffet was honestly sad, only meat dish was butter chicken which lacked immense flavor. The naan was sad, the other curries were simply lacking in any flavor.   I personally cannot speak for the food outside of the buffet, but as an an Indian who has eaten at a fair share of Indian restaurants, both North and South, this was by far the worst representation of Indian food. The staff was friendly and although there was a weird odor in the dining area, we had already sat down and was starving from our long drive.   Maybe one day I will go back and try the regular menu, but I will definitely not be back for the lunch buffet.",

The place in a small shopping center on Kings Drive. The decor is modern Indian. The lone lady working that night was dressed in Indian attire.   The menu is broad with Indian and indochinese options.   We started out with a few appetizers to share. The cauliflower was amazing with a tangy sauce.  For an entree, I ordered my usual for takeout the Murg Vindaloo - Spicy. It was still as good as takeout but a little flat on the spice level. I don't think they give Americans credit for appreciating spicy food.   Other than that, service was good. The bench seating is a bit uncomfortable and may need replacement.   Note: they give a discount to anyone paying cash. For me, I didn't have the full cash amount to cover my dinner but gave them what I had for a discount and put the rest on a card. This is a great policy that I wish more places would do.",

Soon after, someone came out with a container of regular cooked chicken pieces and literally plopped it into the same old sauce that remained and gave it a quick stir. Not okay...  if I were you I'd find some place else, save yourself from the interaction with depressing staff and even more depressing excuse of Indian food.

I think this is something unique that reflects the regional differences that often get glossed over in Indian cuisine.  The food is flavorful, and service is fast.  My two complaints: 1) something always seems to get miscommunicated to the kitchen regarding the spiciness of the dish.  Not too hot--_too mild_!  This has been verified when I look at my cheque--they list the spiciness requested next to the dish.  2)  While quick to refill water, if you order any other beverage, it gets forgotten.  My soda/tea glass is empty, and I eventually have to ask the waiter for a refill.  In terms of service, this is a big issue for me, personally.  Bottom line:  good food, pretty good service.  I hope to one day be in Charlotte to try the lunch buffet other reviewers have raved about.  One last item, this place is in a _tiny_ shopping area with a _tiny_ parking lot, so be forewarned.",

    "text": "This was a great meal but with rushed service.  We had dinner on a weekday. My mother ordered the murg vindaloo \"Indian hot\" and loved the level of spiciness.  I order the kadhai paneer medium. Now, my heart sinks when the waiter at an Indian restaurant asks how hot I want it.  (My standard answer is \"however the chef thinks it should be\", but waiters never accept that answer.)  Where I live a customer is never asked, but it seems to be a standard question in smaller cities.  My dish turned out to be perfectly seasoned.  My only issue was how quickly we were rushed out.  The waiter was asking us about dessert before my mother had finished her entree.  We ordered dessert and it arrived--before my mother had finished her entree.  The check came lickety-split.  I'm not sure what the hurry was as we were there at an early hour.",

I've only ever had their lunch buffet, and I've been pleased both with the price (LOVE) and number of vegetarian options.  Fully half the buffet is veg, which is more than I can say of other Indian buffets.  The curries were decent but less spicy than I would like.  With that said, I have to echo others in raving about their samosas, which were the spiciest thing on the buffet and were truly revelatory.  I would go back to Maharani simply for the samosas, hands-down.  The people that own it seem nice.",

Tonight we tried Maharani.  When I crave Indian food, it's not about the ambiance or the service.  It's all about curries, rice, naan and spices.  While Maharani is a decent restaurant, its food is nothing special.  I ordered my usual round of chicken tikka masala, mutter paneer and veggie samosas.  The samosas were crispy but the filling was very pasty and far too pureed.  I could barely finish my serving of mutter paneer; it was extremely earthy tasting and the paneer quite bland.  That said, the chicken tikka masala was pretty enjoyable and had a wonderfully rich tomato curry sauce.  Would I eat here again if I'm in the area?  Only if Meskerem isn't open.  Time to find a better Indian place, I'm afraid.",

I got chicken and vegetable, to be honest my least favorite of the table (oh sure the grass is greener  on the other side) but my side of Garlic Naan is a winner. The chicken Marsala was my favorite dish on the table.   Aside from the food, the waiters can't wait to fill your water (seriously, take a sip and it will get fill in the next 120 seconds). On the other hand, it could be just another Monday Night.   Also, if you want to build your appetite before dinner/lunch, cross the street and turn left for a great stroll to the Freedom Park by the time you get back, you ready for some serious food.",

The owner/ manager stopped at our table twice to ensure that everything was going well. Reminds me of days gone by where you would eat at a \"family owned\" restaurant. I loved the fact that several people came in after we did (which was 8:15pm on a Thursday), keeping the atmosphere lively. Having said that, one of the things that I love about this restaurant is that you actually can hear yourself have a conversation. It is a good medium size, yet NOT thumping with loud music and 20+ tables that you need to talk over, which exists in many Charlotte restaurants as the city has grown. The cuisine was fantastic too ! I like the spices- I  would call it a more refined palette, with enough variations on curry to satisfy everyone. If you have any questions on the menu, I would suggest asking the waiter to go into more detail on sauces, spices, etc. Enjoy !",

Extremely flavorful. Even the dough is spiced.  Bajii/Pakora - good, a little bland.   Naan - also stellar. Perfectly prepared, garlic and plain alike.  Thali - overpriced. This is a smaller thali than I'm used to, as it includes only three dishes, no lemon pickle, no daal. Rice is pretty bland (where's ma cardamom!). Vegetable Masala was the stand out here, although if I ate an entire entree of it, I think my heart would explode (WHOA butter). $18.  Mushroom Mutter - solid, nothing exciting. $12. Despite the flavors in this dish being subtle to the point of bland, it was neon orange. Hmm.  There's a short Indo-Chinese menu here that I'd like to sample from - maybe next time.  Would I come back for the much-more-reasonably priced lunch buffet? Possibly. Will I continue to drive way out to Woodlands when I'm craving Indian? Most definitely.",

Their version was a little too thin and crispy for my liking, but hey, it's really only there to balance out the spiciness of the other dishes anyway.  The Butter Chicken is by far my favorite dish.  Ever since having this dish at Maharani, I've tried tracking down the butter chicken sauce at local grocers, with only moderate success.  Good stuff.  Service is OK, but you have to expect just OK service when you're eating from the buffett.

    "text": "Great Indian restaurant!  It's like stepping across a few continents and tasting authentic Indian cuisine.  The \"naan\" flat bread is piping hot when it comes to your table.  The garlic naan is my favorite.  And the curries are always wonderful.    If you haven't tried Indian food, take your time getting used to the menu.   Generally the main dishes are chicken, lamb or vegetables, in a different kind of curry sauce.  If you go on a date you can order two or three plates and share.  The items toward the top of each list are simpler and less spicy.  The further down the menu you go, the more interesting and spicy the dishes get.  I recommend starting with \"medium\" and seeing if that's too hot or if you'd actually like spicier.   If you ask for \"between mild and medium\" they can do that too.  I like to pick one meat dish and one vegetable dish, usually something with potatoes.  Dinner comes with basmati rice (long grain rice with a little saffron).  Super friendly service although not American style waitering.  There is generally a head waiter who is also the host.  They will seat you and take your order.  After that, other waiters will serve you in turn, one getting drinks and another serving food.  It can be a bit slow at times, so don't go if you're in a rush.  Give yourself at least an hour or two.  Even if you decide curry's not for you, it's an amazing experience of completely different flavors. When in doubt, order a chicken dish.",
