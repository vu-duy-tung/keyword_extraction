However, as a wine bar, I wish the menu by-the-glass was a little better. They only had about 20 choices in total between whites and reds. I didn't recognize but a couple on the list and wish there was more to grab my attention. Overall though, not bad. I would go again.",

    "text": "I've heard for many months that Wooden Vine has pretty fantastic food, an interesting interior and great wine. I finally got the chance to stop in for a glass and a snackaroo and here's how it came out...  The Good: They offer a pretty nice selection of wine and small bites plus affordable sandwiches and such for lunch or a light dinner. I also saw the chalkboard that showcased a pretty sweet boxed lunch special. They also boast great daily specials that range from $5 glasses to $5 mimosas. The interior is quite cool and definitely interesting.   The Meh: When hubs and I rolled in on a Thursday evening the service was definitely lacking and fairly aloof. No one told us about the specials (which I would have ordered), welcomed us or told us anything about the place. It was a simple, \"What can I get you?\" They also had the TV (and sound) on, the music on and the lights were super bright at 8:30 pm. At least they muted the TV when we kindly asked if they would. Sensory overload. While they no longer carry the wine I ordered off the menu, the server offered another from the same area. Sure why not. The problem is, it didn't taste nearly like my original choice. Make sure the staff knows what they're selling...  The Bad: The cheese plate. Oh my the cheese plate. I love cheese. Let's just make that clear and the cheese at Wooden Vine is good. Good cheese. The problem? Two small chunks of three cheeses and a pile of ciabatta for hubs and I...$10 and 2 minutes later the cheese was gone and I'm still starvin'. I consciously tried to bite each mini piece of cheese in half so I could extend the life of our cheese but that just didn't suffice. I've had my share of cheese plates in Charlotte and this one really pales in comparison. I took a photo of the cheese plate for reference...  I may come back to Wooden Vine, but I'll definitely check out the scene before I walk in and order something besides the cheese plate...especially if I'm hungry.",

The waiter told us to just pick any table we wanted, and didn't mind when we sat at a table meant for 8 since it was the only one open.  They recommended a lovely malbec to go with our meal that I wish didn't come out warm.  We ordered: A pork belly appetizer that I was excited to try but it ended up coming out as an empanada with the pork belly shredded and pulverized.   Travesty. Charcuterie plate - the cheese was good, but the meat came out shredded into little pieces.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just weird.   Romaine wedge salad - nothing special but it was good  Crab gnocchi - HORRIBLE.  I've never had such bad gnocchi before.  I don't know what they did to that potato but it was tasteless and had the consistency of clay.   I would not recommend it to anybody.",

    "text": "Okay, time for a confession. My original review was my first Yelp review ever. I loved the bar so much that I had to sign up and help it survive. I loved its idea, even though the initial opening left some rough edges. But the bad experiences continued. The food was slow, the menu short, and the hostess was once downright rude. I thought about updating my review with a more reasonable rating, but I didn't have the heart. I loved what Wooden Vine wanted to be and couldn't bring myself to admit that it was failing.  And now I don't have to. The management has changed, the food menu is expanded, the kitchen stays open later, the music is awesome (and, occasionally, live), the lights are a little brighter, and the decor is as interesting as ever. The bar has finally succeeded in expressing the ideal that it put forward last year. It took a while, but the end result is well worth the wait.",

We decided on The Wooden Vine to keep our dinner within walking distance, and we had previously attended the cooking competition \"Fire in the City\" which introduced us to The Wooden Vine's cuisine. Upon our arrival, we were seated at a rustic wooden table. Being NYE there was a set menu which included a bottle of white or red wine or a bottle of sparkling wine. We chose sparkling and checked out our options. I was happy that mussels were available as a starter and my husband selected the charcuterie. My mussels were delicious in a creamy broth. The charcuterie was just a few pieces of manchego cheese and crackers but when we asked if meat was included, our waiter, Andrew, brought forth another plate with prosciutto which we were happy about. After that, I was served butternut squash soup that was so rich and velvety it was practically pudding. My husband's beet salad looked great and he said it was yummy since I can't stand beets. Our entrees of scallops for him and wagyu skirt steak for me were very tasty but I was fading fast after all the rich food. Finally dessert, a crisp apple tart for me and creme brulee for him. We had a wonderful dinner in a cool, rustic venue with great service. This was a perfect way to start off 2017!",

    "text": "Updating my update.....  The owner is very nice and responded to my diatribe.  I guess it was a misunderstanding.  Wooden Vine will always be one of our favorite spots.  Previous review:  I am downgrading my review here from 5 stars.  It has nothing to do with the food - Chef Nicholas is fantastic and I hope the restaurant can hang on to him.  This will always be one of our favorite date spots due to attention to the menu and wine selection.  My downgrade just has to do with a recent experience - the boyfriend and I were there for Valentine's Day.  It was $150 per couple - the meal was divine.    The disappointing part came to the service - we brought with us an expensive bottle of wine ($70 bottle of wine which we knew they did not sell there) and there were no issues.  We knew they had a ten dollar corking fee.  HOWEVER we ordered a second bottle of wine and told the waiter \"our palettes are shot after this bottle - so something less expensive...definitely NOT another $70 bottle of wine.\"  So - we had that bottle and all is lovey-dovey for Valentines Day.    Until we get the bill.  The waiter had actually brought us a $69 bottle of wine.  He did not tell us prior to drinking it.  Of course we should have asked.  But really?  We say 'Not another $70 bottle of wine\"  and you bring us a $69 bottle of wine.  What on earth?  Is that supposed to be funny?    It really soured me on the place - which until then had been one of my favorites.  It will definitely be a while before we are back.",

It was 2 small umimpressive sausages, 2 cheeses, Flatbread, and some random jelly. I know rent is expensive in downtown but this was a bit much.  Even Roosters, a very popular restaurant in downtown and Southpark isn't that pricey.  I mentioned it to the waitress when she brought it cause I was so shocked and she said nobody ever said anything...maybe they didn't want to appear cheap in front of a date or coworkers.

Since I have never used Yelp for reservations, I made a follow up phone call to the restaurant on Friday afternoon to confirm our reservation & remind them that we need a vegetarian entree. The response was no problem as we have them on our menu. We ordered the only vegetarian dinner entree on the menu & were told that were all out of it at 6:30PM?. How is this even possible unless they never prepared any of it that day? The waiter advised us their chef can make an alternative dish. We had previously ordered spinach dip & tomatoes as appetizers. When are entrees were served, the alternative vegetarian entree was spinach dip over a bed of rice. Redundant, bland & unacceptably poor quality! When asked how we liked our dinner, we expressed our disappointment & they agreed to remove the charge for this entree & subsequently discounted the bottle of wine by half. The appetizers were mediocre, we had to ask for water refills & to top it off they could not validate our parking, no explanation was given but they either couldn't operate the machine or it was broken.  While the discounts were helpful, they did not mitigate a deeply flawed dining experience. We noticed that most guest were not having dinner, just drinks & appetizers. Based on our experience this is a wise choice as this is definitely NOT a good place for dinner!",

    "text": "Let me start of by saying it was Restaurant Week - but regardless, my exeprience was not great.  The staff was nice and semi-attentive, but perhaps rushed and confused because there was a lot going on.    It felt like I was in the twilight zone when we walked inside.  The decor was lacking in my taste, though the whole restaurant is made of reclaimed wood which is awesome - it was ruined by the large photos of grapes everywhere, and the strange choice of different colored velour chairs.    To start, the silverware was dirty - greasy and stained.  Had to clean it myself.  For our appetizer, we had duck wings.  The duck wings were a soggy and greasy.  They fell off the bone and were tender which was a plus, but had zero flavor save the taste of grease and a touch of honey (think that was supposed to be tamarind).  Probabaly would have been better if there was some salt and pepper or something.  I had the seafood paella for my entree.   The crawfish was completely raw. The portion of the meal was the size of an appetizer and had only mussels - no squid or shrimp as advertised. The rice was a bit too al dente and did not look like a normal yellow rice should. I sent the plate back and the chef came out and apologized, kindly comp'ing my meal for my troubles - sitting and watching everyone eat while I was starving.   I did appreciate that he came out to do that.  But the second plate was still part raw and had an even smaller portion of rice, but at least one piece of squid.   Taste wise it wasn't bad.  My boyfriend had the venison which wasn't a total failure. The brussels sprouts were cooked well but doused in grease. The venison was tasty and had a nice texture - guess that is what the 1 star is for.  But the wine pairing was not very good - it tasted like a wine soaked in a metal casket.   By the time we reached dessert, we were just fed up.  The meal was not a pleasant experience. They were having freezer problems and brought us raspberry sorbet instead of Nutella, and the dark chocolate piece did not look very appetizing; it was a long limp brown log that was actually wet from condensation.  And it sat on top of a messy pile of chocolate cake crumbs, which was not very pleasing to the eye.  All I can say is maybe it's different when it's not Restaurant Week, but I was not too pleased to end a fun weekend in Charlotte with that.",

I should note that it has some mid-eastern spices in it so expect just a bit of a kick and a non-traditional taste.  We tried the $10 mystery wine.  Great choice.  They select a wine then if you can guess the grape and region it is free.   This is a no loose proposition.  Win you get your wine for free.  Lose and you get a nice glass of wine.  They stumped us both.  I should had guessed the red but I was ok at missing the white as it is a grape I had never tried.  Yet another reason to give it a shot.",

Their Somm (forgot his name) is very knowledgeable and will create a nice flight for you depending on your tastes.  To me, this is not a real \"foodie\" place but they do have small tapas plates that are quite tasty.  This is all about wine here....so that's why I go, especially before a show at the Blumenthal.",

    "text": "When you walk in the first thing you notice is the pleasant and attentive staff. The waiter was charismatic and not pushy about expensive wines during restaurant week. The decor is awesome-tables made of polished pieces of oak and giant wall art of what else?-grapes.   Racks of wine on the wall and varying hues of green and brown paint add to the understated charm of the place.  The food was bad ass. I do like green eggs and ham, yes I do like them Sam I am. Dr. Seuss lied. They are delicious. Go try them. Now. Just stop what you are doing and head over there.  Ok, on to the entrees. Braised bison tail and beer can Cornish game hen. To be clear, these are separate dishes.  Ummm, wow. The meat was tender and flavorful and the corn souffle that came with the beer can hen was one of the better side dishes I have ever encountered in my life. (my partner would not stop stealing it off my plate).  For me, going out to eat is a chance usually to eat things I can't make myself and experience something uniquely delicious. Our dessert was like this- lemon meringue pie that was deconstructed in a bowl with meringue \"sticks\". I felt like the entree portions were perfect while the appetizer and dessert could have been a little larger. However, the service was flawless and this was the type of place that made us linger of an extra glass of wine.",

    "text": "My special friend and I visited this restaurant on the first leg of an epic date that happened to coincide with the running of the Criterium bike race. We had no idea that we would have to cross the Criterium course four times in order to reach the Wooden Vine, but the dinner was indeed worth the risk of being clipped by a couple of cycles! (Incidentally, the bistro tables out front were full of spectators--this is a prime viewing spot for the bike race!)  We opted for the new Spring Chef's Tasting Menu--a seven-course gastronomic pleasure cruise that took us through two-thirds of the spring menu. Each course was lovingly served by the enthusiastic Chef Nicholas, who informed us that we were the first to try the tasting menu. Given the quality of the farm-to-table ingredients and the care in which they were prepared, I doubt we will be the last to take the plunge and be pleased.  My favorite was the pasta course--a stinging nettle-filled mini-ravioli that has a fancy name, but I didn't catch it. Mostly because I was controlling the urge to lick my plate clean of the verdant sauce covering each pillowy piece of pasta--pure heaven, y'all. Each plate featured some sort of spring flower garnish but this one totally stood out--atop the pile of saucy green goodness was a single, violently orange petal perfectly matching the chili oil dotting the plate. Someone loves vibrant colors and I love them for it!  I also enjoyed the cheese course--a creamy local fromage with a cocoa-nib rind served over buttery cornbread with apple butter and peach preserves. That would've been enough for dessert itself. That is, until the espresso cup of rich chocolate mousse arrived in the dessert course. So rich and smooth, it was tough to finish, but I'm no quitter, folks :-)  All in all, beautiful decor and food presentation came together in a feast for the senses. The only real shame is that we didn't try any wine during our visit--all the more reason to return and experience the new menu and the wine it was crafted to compliment.   Enjoy, folks, and keep eating (and drinking) local!",

There is a large selection of wines and other spirits, along with tasty eats to enjoy inside or outside of the restaurant. Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. My friend asked if there were any specials we should know about, (because most bars in uptown offer daily or weekly drink specials). The waiter told us no, but we were able to pull up a page on their site advertising 50% certain bottles of wine. While my friend went back to the site to retrieve the information to show him, he hovered over her shoulder watching her navigate, which was rude and a bit creepy. When she found the page, instead of offering to honor the advertisement (which would have been the good customer service thing to do), he wanted to know how she found that page and stated \"we deactivated that page\". He gave us the impression that he thought we fabricated a fake page specifically to get half off a bottle of wine. The service wasn't terrible, but it did make my friends and I feel a unwelcome. We took our business down to the next block to Duckworth's where the menu was extensive, service was spectacular, and the drink specials were honored as advertised.",

It's a very chill atmosphere where you can chose from a nice wine selection and relax. The bar itself is a long curvy piece of wood which adds a nice flavor to the bar.   The bartender was very knowledgable on all their wines and gave pretty thorough explanations as to which wines from which countries he recommended. My wine was delicious and I definitely would have had a a few more if I didn't have to head out. They also had a pretty awesome looking desert menu that i unfortunately was too full to sample, but it's the perfect compliment to a nice glass of wine. The location is perfect as its right the middle of uptown Charlotte with easy access to everything else.   Very nice place worth checking out.",

Best advice- try mystery glass of wine being served in your choice of red or white. If you guess region and maker of wine, your glass is on the house. The best part is that you get to try the best of best wine for $10. Its a great bargain as what they pour is usually between $25-45 a bottle. I wish the staff was more friendly and attentive but i guess if it was, you would probably not get in the place. I highly recommend this place.",

The interior is uniquely designed and truly fits the name.   Now on to the food! We ordered the Mussels, Flank Steak and Herbed Gnocchi. The gnocchi had the perfect texture and was filled with flavor! The mussels had a very subtle and light taste, but it was delicious. In my opinion, the flank steak was not unique like the other two dishes. It was cooked to perfection, but I expected to taste a distinctive flavor like I did with the gnocchi and mussels. I think the dishes are intended to complement their wine selection and thus, are relatively SMALL. Nonetheless, the meal was surprisingly filling and very yummy! =)",

    "text": "Let me just start out by saying, this place used to be awesome. I suppose until it became under new management more recently. I used to go to the wooden vine all the time for wine and small bites after work, with friends, on the weekends at night, and my good friend who is extremely knowledgeable of wine used to be the manager here. Even since he's left I've continued to frequent the wooden vine and recommend it to people from all over, all the time. I work and live in uptown Charlotte and network with everyone I come across, even tourist that ask where they should go while they are in town- I used to send them here. Welp- not anymore!   I went in on New Years Eve to bring in the new year over a glass of Champagne with 5 friends...(by the way this is probably the 3rd new years eve in a row I've spent at the wooden vine). As I was handing the \"door man\" (we'll call him) my ID, it slipped out of my hand and hit the floor. I picked it up and proceeded to hand it to him. As a result of this incident he determined, solely from that, that I must be too drunk to be served and refused to give me a glass of champagne, about 4 or 5 minutes before the ball drop.   Fair enough right? I've worked in food & bev long enough to know that you most certainly can refuse to serve anyone at anytime if you feel they are too intoxicated. However, you need to at least come up with a legitimate and professional reason to do so, and you need to communicate that effectively.... directly to the person you are refusing to serve. In a very untactful and passive aggressive manner he told someone else in our group, that I was not being served. Pause. Hello- I'm right here, not in the third person, talk to me, what kind of establishment are we in after all? After that, a group of loud, twenty some year old college kids, (one guy and 5 girls) came gallivanting in shortly behind us and DIDN'T EVEN GET ID'd at the door because mister door man was so preoccupied with us. Because that makes a lot of sense considering all the trouble we were given over a \"dropped ID\", doesn't it?   ...What happened there on Thursday night was completely uncalled for and unnecessary thanks to the young, overzealous newbie manager who was on a serious power trip new years eve night. It honestly blew our minds.  I was in there just about a week or so prior to this incident and the same young man was clunking around in the wine racks clanking bottles and dropping things himself right behind the table we were sitting at, you didn't see any of us writing a bad review then about the manager at the wooden vine being a clumsy and sloppy wanna be sommelier- did you? No, because it's okay to have butter fingers from time to time.... Or is it? ....Guess not.   It's okay.... new year's eve must have just been too much for his nervous system to handle. Good luck keeping loyal customers that way.... I hope someone else cuts you a break next time. You'll just have to figure out how to make better judgment calls in the future.  That being said... The old management at Wooden Vine was the best thing that ever happened to this place, and the owners are super super nice as well.... because of this I am more than confident that they will soon get their act better together, but I won't be around to find out.",

While traveling to Charlotte, I tried almost every restaurant near the Epicenter and majority are underwhelming.. I was so happy to find this establishment. The Wooden Vine is definitely a diamond in the rough. Despite being extremely casual and a simple wine bar- you can get really delicious small plates.   The tapas are all natural and made from local ingredients. The hummus is simply amazing. Almost everything I tried was impressive.

It was the special which is a half sandwich and house salad. House salad was only lettuce and a tiny amount of dressing. (had to ask for 2nd dressing just to cover salad) Maybe with a little TLC, this place could become a good lunch spot, but definitely not worth visiting at this time.

Both of the appetizer dips (hummus, Cheese) were really tasty and their pizzas tasted fresh and yummy!   My friends and I are by no means savants when it comes to wine or beer but they seemed to carry a good selection of both.  I would recommend checking out their menus on their website to know if they carry what you like. I was slightly disappointed that they were out of two of the four desserts they carried. I ended up getting the honey orange mousse, which tasted a little bland once the drizzle of honey was gone... The service was very quick and all of the employees were super polite.

We ordered dirty martinis that came out almost straight vodka, which was really disappointing. The pork belly - kopitas were okay. They had a sourness to them that I attributed to the apple. The duck quesadillas were a huge disappointment. The duck was way overcooked and the naan bread was almost burnt. Overall we gave it a 6 out of 10, and probably won't go back.",

Since several people recommended it, we decided to try it out. We could not have had a better time! The place is so unique over the other establishments in uptown. It is quaint and the wood decor is delightful! The wine list was impressive and the sommelier was gracious and explained each wine for us in our wine flight, which I highly recommend getting by the way. The menu was adventerous. We all tried different things so we could taste as much as possible. I got the lamb shank which was heavenly, the other things we tried were the venison short ribs and the pealla. All were were prepared and so good! We will be back tomorrow night as there are many more things we want to try before we leave! Thanks to all those who gave us this special recommendation!",

Enjoyed a white wine flight (great value at only $12 and fun to try different varieties). My fellow diners and I split the cheese platter, quite yummy. I had the gnocchi- great gnocchi but the sauce was a bit bland-- and the shrimp fettuccine-perfectly peppery without being overbearing. Fellow diners had the pork which was melt-in-your-mouth good (and I don't really eat pork), the chicken tacos (they said they were good) and flank steak (the worst of our choices- very fatty and not much good meat). They ran out of the peach cobbler we ordered for dessert so they gave us a chocolate tartine on the house- and it was delicious! Adorable decor, reasonable prices, great atmosphere-- live music when we were there, and excellent service.",

We had the calamari which was fine, but a bit on the salty side. it was served with a cajun dipping sauce which didn't have much flavor. The entrees all come in 2 size options on the current menu. I ordered the salmon & kale but wasn't asked which size option I wanted - I assumed the small was the lunch portion and the large was the dinner. When our food arrived, the server announced that it was the small portion. The salmon was roughly 3\" x 2\" in size and came with 2 pieces of kale. I ended up sending the fish back since the center was dark, wet and soft. The kale was so salty I coughed when I took a bite. My dining companion said it tasted like it was brined in salt water first.  I still think Wooden Vine has great ambiance, though the light classical background music it used to have is replaced by classic rock, and I'd go for a drink anytime, but perhaps skip dinner.",

We weren't sure how big the plates were going to be so we also ordered the cast iron Mac and cheese - which was spot on.  The turtle S'more brownie dessert was good but not great.  The brownie was a bit on the dry side but the rest of the dish was good.  As you can tell we made pigs of ourselves but we left feeling satisfied with the whole experience.",

I think we hit the nail on the head with that one.   The interior is very laid back. I loved the wooden scuplted tables....they added such a nice element to the dining experience. We ordered a bottle of wine to split and the boiled peanut hummus to start off with. The wine was a cabernet and excellent. The boiled peanut hummus was so good....my dad was even talking about it the next day!  Next, we ordered three small plates to share. We ordered the WTF chicken (the name was longer than that but I can't remember it....only the first 3 letters stood out haha), the Short and Corny, and some seafood bake. The Short and Corny was the favorite among all 4 of us. Delicious short ribs sitting on top of a creamed corn casserole........so good! The chicken was also very good and had this very tasty sauce over it. The seafood bake was good but didnt stand out like the other two items.   The only negative comment is that service is pretty slow here. They don't have many servers...sometimes it is just one person taking care of the whole restaurant. It didn't really bother us much because we were just drinking wine and chatting.   At the end of the night, all four of us were stuffed and left happy. We were still raving about the food the next day....so that means it's gotta be good!",

I've also dealt with the female bar tender, she was nice but not very personable when I was the only one at the entire bar during a slow time of day. She also was having some private conversations with another staff member, which is fine, but not what I expected at a place I'd describe as a quaint family run wine bar. (Really not sure if its family run, but they do well at giving off the vibe.) Good for dates, but I think slightly overpriced for the value. Also, they don't carry Zinfandel, my favorite grape, which was also a bummer. Obviously I've been twice, so I like it, but I'm not opposed to find a better spot for good wine and service that wants to treat you like a regular.",

WoodenVine was a bit of a disappointment in many respects. Sarah, while not a sommelier was very helpful and passionate about wine selection but the owner was completely uninterested in the few patrons that were present and the other bar staff was short, unwelcoming and had a bit of a scowl. The wine was just okay and there are only three items on the menu during the day (a cheese plate, a charcuterie plate and popcorn. So for my party of one I paid $36 for a meat and cheese mix because they are only sold separately without exception.   Pros Sarah did accommodate a flight of wine on a non flight day (flights are Tuesday only). Decor is fitting with upscale wine bars  Cons Unprofessional owners who walked around puttering about without so much as a smile or acknowledgment of customers. Staff not well trained or managed.  Wine selection is a B-  With so many other options is Charlotte for good wine and cocktails, I couldn't recommend WoodenVine : (",

We noticed the decor right when we walked in which was very cool and welcoming. There was wood (surprise!) all around and it was very organic in shape and just fun to look at. At the bar they had a basket of discounted wine so you could buy a bottle to take home or to enjoy with friends in the restaurant. $20 bucks for a nice red. Can't beat that. We ordered lots of little plates and one of my favorites was the caprese salad. Its not easy to get such a juicy, red tomato this early in the season. Yum! Good place for little groups and they do have one large table if you want to go for a celebration. They even have a few bistro tables out front. Go for lunch or dinner today!",

The staff was pleasant enough, but I always have my antennas up when coming into places that would be considered higher quality.  I am a supporter of places that cater to all patrons equally.  My initial thought was that it did not, but our waitress was very attentive and informative of the different wines in the flight we chose.  The spinach artichoke dip which was featured that night was not great, so I sent it back.  Our waitress did offer to replace it with something else.  The crab cakes were really good so my friend and I shared those.  All in all it was a nice space and I would go back.",

Atmosphere was extremely intimate and warm. Michael, behind the bar, is very knowledgeable and recommended a great Cabernet.  I ended up having a tapas plate that I enjoyed very much.  Chef B from a successful nearby restaurant was dining next to me and we discussed why he enjoyed the food here so much. Chef Nikki emerged from the kitchen to visit and was a total pleasure.  I returned this evening after Hornets game, intent on sampling the menu. I took Michael up on his suggestion of the locally sourced honey sweetened goat cheese filled tortellini, encased in house made pasta.  Accompanying this treasure was port braised beef short ribs slow cooked 16 hours. Scrumptious. I met Bethany, the owner, who is obviously passionate about her business; the quality of the food and beverages she serves, her staff, and all of the clientele - the old-timers and the newbies like me.  Wish I could stay in Charlotte longer and visit The Wooden Vine again. Next time!",

Ive had the Gouda cheese board and it was very well put together. It came with the cheese ( of course), raspberries, crunchy bread, pickles veggies (which were very unique), and this house made chocolate/fudge(really gives you a rush of endorphins).   Unfortunately it's hard to tell when this place is actually open. One night I went with friends, and they were closing to the public early so we had to leave. Another night I wanted to bring my hubby for the amazing wine, and we discovered they were closed when we got there, and then two other times I wanted to go and didn't know they were closed until we got there. Its almost like they should post a calendar outside so you'll know when they're open. It was really disappointing and pushes me not to select this place even though the wine is so good, because how disappointing would it be to make plans to go here only to find they are closed to the public when you get there?  At least i know they are great for private events lol, maybe.",

There is so much to love about this groovy little niche bistro. On an oppressively hot June evening, I walked from the sidewalk into an inviting (if not a little dark) electro-jazz filled small bar area. The bar itself is very generous considering the overall size of the venue - 10 bar seats and 4 high tops. It really only took a few minutes to adjust to the lighting. The bartender, Michael,  offered light but not over indulging conversation and excellent wine selections. I started with the Beet and Goat Cheese salad paired with a lush Spanish rose. For my entre I had the small plate of Braised Short Rib with house made goat cheese stuffed tortellini over lightly dressed arugula paired with and Eldorado Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The beet salad could benefit from a lighter hand with the balsamic reduction, but if that is the only thing in which I can find fault I'd call this evening a big win. Business travelers and locals alike can find a welcome change from the ordinary at this little gem.",

The interior of the restaurant has a very nice wooden, tavern-y feel, which I absolutely loved. Music could've been a little fancier, but it wasn't bad music per se. It's just not the kind of music you'd hear in an upscale restaurant I guess.  Food was wonderful. We tried a charcuterie board with the chef's selection of two cheeses and three meats. Those were all really good. The accompanying crackers did not taste fresh though. They were chewy, but I don't think they were meant to be chewy. They tasted like they were meant to be crunchy but had stayed out too long. We also got the crab dip and hummus which were both good.  After two beers and two bottles of merlot, the check came to $250 before tip. We were prepared to splurge, but just wanted to give everyone an idea of what to expect.  PS: The wine we ordered was the one that our server recommended. It was one of the \"cheaper\" ones.",

The spinach dip was very cheesy. Unfortunately, the crab dip lacked chunks of crab, which would have made it better. While everything was pretty good, nothing stood out as special.

Don't visit Wooden Vine looking for a big meal, you won't get it here.  However, if you are looking to try a fairly unique wine, this is definitely the place.  The wine selection can be perused in a book.  That's right, they have a book for the wine selection but one sheet of paper for the food.  Clearly, this is a great place to sip the wine of your choosing.  I am giving them 4 stars for the wine selection and won't bother to discuss food options any further.",

    "text": "My friend and I were looking for a quick bite for dinner before a performance across the street at Blumenthal.  We didn't plan on spending too much, but wanted something cleaner than tavern/bar food.  We've been to Wooden Vine before for after-work drinks and lunch, so decided to check the dinner menu.  I was happy to see some burgers, and my friend crab cakes.  The prices were reasonable, and we decided to head in.  The first surprise came when we were told that the menu posted on the door was the lunch menu, and not the dinner menu, and that they simply forgot to flip it over.  This meant that the burgers weren't there (no big deal) and the price for crab cakes changed from $15 to $28.  My fault for not noticing.  We decided to stay as time was short, and we both really like crab cakes.  The manager apologized for the confusion and offered to serve us the lunch portion, forewarned that the lunch portion is not large enough for splitting.  We declined the offer and decided on splitting the dinner portion.  As an appetizer, we ordered the caprese salad which was good, but small for the price.  The mozzarella was homemade and decent.    We also ordered bread (charged at $5).  The small, croissant sized, sliced roll arrived.  At first bite my friend said \"this is dry and tastes stale\".  I had a piece and agreed, but moved on.  Soon thereafter, the entree arrived.  Holy disappointment.  We're talking two, 4\" diameter cakes,  each of which could be consumed in two bites.  The cakes were presented on a portion of cold couscous and accompanied by 4 stalks of grilled asparagus.  At this point we're amazed.  How can a restaurant charge $28 for the entree we just ate?  How can a restaurant charge $5 for bread, especially when it was hard as a rock?    When the server returned, I demonstrated how hard the last two portions of the bread were.  I actually bounced a section on the table and asked the server to feel how hard the bread is.  The server did not apologize nor acknowledge how hard the bread was.  She truly couldn't be bothered.  I thought it couldn't get worse...  It did.  The real slap in the face, and the reason I wrote this review, is that they gave us a $3 discount on the $5 bread.  This stated to me \"we truly don't care if you come back.\"  When the bill was presented, the discount wasn't explained and NO apology was given.    Here's a script you can use in the future:  \"Sir, I'm sorry you felt the bread was dry.  I think you received a bad loaf.  As a note of good faith, I have removed the charge for the bread.\"  NOPE!  $3 off a $5 order of bread!  I'm still blown away!  Total was $63 - oh sorry, $60, including a diet coke and a cocktail.  Please appreciate your guests.  There's many places to go uptown before a show.  We will never go back; we will never recommend.  ---  Reply to the owner:  You guys are incredible.  I did not slam the bread. I bounced it. Crumbs did not go anywhere near the server. That's a blatant lie. You are effectively accusing me of assault.  Second, eating 95% of the bread? I ate 3 pieces of it. The last two (heel and section) were what I didn't eat. The entire loaf was dry, but the end pieces were edible. I'm amazed that you're trying to defend yourself.  You should reconsider your response. It is quite sad. You come across as a restaurant who will admit no wrong. You've done nothing but sound defensive instead of taking responsibility for a bad experience.",

The menu wasn't exactly my thing - a bit more adventurous than I was feeling. But I had an awesome steak with leeks and potatoes and a great berry tart dessert.   Despite staying for awhile when it was rather crowded, I never felt rushed. The ambiance was great. Just the right level of lighting. Wooden, but polished and modern. Just small enough to feel intimate, but large enough to accommodate a crowd. It had a nice rustic, classy, not intimidating, upscale feel.  This was a great Charlotte dining experience and I would definitely recommend it.",

We have frequented many times both as a couple and with friends and enjoyed the food as very tasty and avant garde even if it was a little pricey (but, hey, it's not bar food!). They were offering a 2009 Spanish wine for $23/bottle that scored for us!  So, we were a little disappointed and bewlidered recently that food was not served between lunch and dinner.  When the owners discovered our concern, they were quick to reach out to us, apologize and to encourage us to return (which we will).  Apparantly, an employee was negligent in understanding the restaurant's midday food offerings and they assured us it has been remedied.    Therefore, we heartily recommend the Wooden Vine not only for their unique offerings in Uptown Charlotte, but also because the owners are engaged in the day-to-day operation of their business.",

At any rate.... the service was great. Attentive. Courteous. Informative. Wonderful.   The hummus missed the mark. I was going to ask for some air and water to \"spice it up\". It's more of plain whipped chick peas than hummus. But it could be my long time love of Lebanese food causing bias. I digress.   The cheese plate was impressive. Not because of the small amount of cheese but the variety of accompaniments. Curry cauli. Dates. Some banging jam. Craisins. Delish.   She did a class. I did the current Sophisticated Palate flight. Neither impressed. But that's selection based. Hopefully better luck next time.   Overall still a good experience.   Turn the lights up a hair and find the salt and garlic. We will be back.",

They tend to cultivate a loyal following of \"real\" people that understand the trials and tribulations of a small business and don't expect hand outs. The majority of reviews you see that may be negative are likely written by self important people and definitely people that never cooked a meal or worked in the service industry in their life. Most probably were upset they spent too much on their corporate expense account in town or realized harshly Charlotte isn't the greatest place to have your besties bachelorette party bringing in your friends from Hickory because the uptown area doesn't have too many 2 for $20 specials.  Those of you that have a passion for good wine and better heartfelt people, stop here and find yourself becoming a regular. The wine is great and so is the ambiance. Awesome spot for a first date, or 110 of them.",

Anyway upon our arrival, we were promptly seated at one of their comfy couches and proceeded to appreciate how awesome the decor was. I felt like I was visiting a wino Keebler elf inside his tree!! The place was cozy and had amazing wooden accents, even the bathroom was something to check out.   Now, for service, our waiter/bartender was very helpful. he was able to suggest a sweet drink for someone in our party as well as helpful wine suggestions. My mother in law and I opted for a wine flight each. Man, let me tell ya, the pours were generous and the wines incredible! I had the Sophisticated Palate and enjoyed every bit of it. The prices for the flight were not bad at all either. My family and I totally enjoyed the ambiance and great customer service. If I come back to Charlotte, you bet I would be coming back!",

It was really really good, I ate everything. Two of my guests had the grilled cesar salad with scallops. These were no puney scallops (3) and they were cooked perfectly.

It did not disappoint as though it was a slow night it still had a relaxed energy to it  The small plate menu was diverse and ordered the recommended ttuna which was very fresh.  The liquor drinks could have been a bit better but then again this is a wine bar.  The tuna with avocado could have toned down the avocado.

The crock of olives and the cheese and cracker plate are well done. I can't say anything for the wine choices, as I only had a moscato. I suspect the owners hope to make their profit on the wine, since the glass was notably small. Yes, I know a sparkling wine perhaps should be served in a flute.  A solid and affordable place to eat.  The place seems to have a lot of anxious young men working the floor, but we got a warm and engaging foodie waitress the first time. She should get a raise for improving the ambiance.",

There was a sweetness to the dish that was intriguing.  The vegetables retained some texture and added a pleasing crunch.  Our next dish was lamb bahn mi sliders.  These were outstanding on crisp toasted bread, soft on the inside.  Flavorful toppings made it very tasty. The crab cakes allowed the crab to be the star, but added enough garnish to make it unique.  Finally we shared the red neck wedding cake which was outstanding.  The spicy nuts made the dish very interesting instead of just a good chocolate care with cheerwine(!) icing.  They are not afraid to go bold in this restaurant and it succeeds.  I hope they get more business so that they stay around!",

It wasn't the food, but, the somber mood of the place. No one should take themselves this seriously. Pretentious. Snobby and for what?  Get over it and then decide to open a restaurant with a little warmth for folks spending their dollars.   And, for Gods sake----------get some catsup! It is the #1 condiment in the  U. S.

    "text": "Post dinner uptown on a Friday night, we were in the mood for another drink, sans the typical uptown weekend madness (especially on a game night), enter Wooden Vine.  As other have mentioned, I did enjoy the decor, especially as we bellied up to the beautifully gnarled wood bar and took in the drink menu. A decent amount of by the glass options, and a more extensive than expected food menu, though I didn't really look to hard at it, and a (for the most part) full bar. They seemed to have some decent nightly drink specials during the week.   The music switched between soft alternative(?) recordings and a live act, but overall very relaxing for those starting their evening off slow and others just enjoying a meal. If I'm ever looking for a low-key atmosphere uptown, I'll definitely think of Wooden Vine.  Not too crowded, great staff, are there better wine bars in Charlotte? Yes. Are there better wine bars on Tryon open late? Nothing comes to mind.   Taking it from a four star to a three: with one stall restrooms for each sex, a woman thought it would be okay to hog the bathroom for something other than its purpose (I'll let you draw your own conclusions), maybe not the WV's fault, but she felt comfortable enough there to do it. Also, chefs and cooks coming out to the bar to fill up their drinks from the soda gun doesn't really bother me, I've done the same thing and I don't mind seeing who cooks the food, but having one come up using a plastic food storage container as his cup? A little unappealing, to say the least.",

What a great place for a date!!! LADIES--their bathrooms were so clean you probably could have eaten food off the floor--not that I suggest that, but you get the idea. And wow--they did not skimp on decor or furnishings.  I had the Vina Do Val. Fantastic. Others had the Cab, Merlot, and Sauvignon Blanc. They didn't disappoint!

Even so, I enjoyed the flight of random wines I tried. I think it was something like $9 for a flight of three wines. Not totally sure, but the prices were quite reasonable.  The long wood bar and wine imagery all over the place melded well together. Even though the space was large, it was quite cozy and warm.  If you want to impress your girlfriend I'd take her here.

After having walked by this place only about a million times on my way to/from lunch every day, I finally stopped in a couple weekends ago. And what do you know? Its just as charming on the inside as it appears to be from the outside.   My friend and I just wanted to stop in for a glass or two of wine, so we sidled up to the bar, and were instantly greeted by a friendly bartendress (or is she just a waitress? I don't know...she served me wine, and that's all I really care about).   In addition to having a pretty decent wine list (I've seen better, but then again...I've seen much worse), she was also not stingy on the pours, and was more than willing to let me taste a couple wines (free of charge!) before I settled on a lovely Shiraz...and then a Zinfandel :) Honestly, such a chill and welcoming environment...which is the perfect milieu in which wine should be enjoyed! A+, Wooden Vine.  My one criticism is that I'd love to see some wine flights on their menu...I feel like flights are a must-have for any legit wine bar. Otherwise, though, no complaints, and I can't wait to stop in again!!",

When we asked to be moved to a regular table it was obvious they were displeased with us.  (there were several open tables)  We only got one menu for the 5 of us.  We asked if they had more menus and they brought us only one more.  It was very hard to read the tiny print in the dim lighting.   The waiter was nice when he came by, but that was far too infrequent.  Horrible service!  They only brought out food for 4 of us.  When they finally noticed the error they offered to comp her meal and give us a free dessert.  After waiting a very long time for the check we asked about the dessert.  When the waiter finally came back he said the dessert would be several more minutes and asked if we would like to wait. We couldn't wait any longer and left.  The drinks and meals very expensive and very tiny portions.  3 shrimp with 2 one inch squares of hard grits and a tablespoon of purple cabbage for 28$!!!  We went to another establishment afterwards where we got 3 drinks for the price of 1 of the Woden Vine drinks.  And we learned that the place has absentee owners and has a lot of turn over in employees.",

    "text": "A fellow foodie and I had intended to go to Malabar for dinner, but it was closed for renovation or some such thing.  She suggested that we go to the Wooden Vine.   We were greeted and promptly told to find a table that we liked.  This was around April 24th, 2012 or so.  The waitress explained the menu for that night and about the wine flight system (highly recommended - the wine list is excellent, and the flight of three wines for $12 was well worth the price) and the specials that were available.   The restaurant is cozy - lots of wood, chalkboards in the paneling,  Very nice.  Romantic but also somewhat laid back, very subtle lighting.  It is a comfortable space and one that I enjoyed dining in.  Foodwise we started out with the cheese plate, roasted olives, and the grilled romaine Caesar.   A good charcuterie or cheese plate is one of those things I just crave.  The cheese plate here was a disappointment.  Three cheeses - decent portions- but, we were given 7 smallish crackers (smaller than a triscuit) and the cheese with some dried fruit and some sort of preserve that was smeared on the plate. That was it. When we asked for more crackers (should have asked for bread) the waitress gave us a strange look, but brought them out.   The roasted olives were amazing. If you're an olive person - you must try them.  Herbs, lemon zest, and other things were in there - and they were served in olive oil.  Just delicious.  At our request, they waited to bring out the salad.  The grilled romaine Caesar was half a head of romaine that had been grilled and had a chunky style Caesar dressing on it that was exquisite. The grilled lettuce added a complex and complimentary flavor to their rendition of a Caesar dressing.  If they offer this as a menu option, you won't be disappointed.   For the main course - M had the scallops and I had the pork belly over a panzanella-esque style salad.    Both were good.  The scallops, however, won the contest.  Sweet, cooked perfectly, a delicious sauce.  Just amazing.   The pork belly was cooked perfectly and went well with the crunchy panzenalla-esque starch it was served with.  The chief problem was there was nothing on the plate to help offset the fat of the pork belly - it became incredibly rich far too quick with nothing really to compliment yet offset the richness. A surprising oversight.   For dessert we had the pineapple financier- it was a huge disappointment.  The portion was small (two small pieces of the cake itself, and a scoop of ice cream with garnish)  M and I each claimed one piece of cake and fought over the ice cream.  Neither of us finished the cake.  The comment made was, \"It wasn't worth the calories.\"   I will probably venture back in to the Wooden Vine, but it isn't on the list of places that I have to visit again.   Three and a half stars.",

I had the Brunn (one of the \"alternative whites,\" from Austria) and the Piquilo Pepper Bruschetta. Both were good, but nothing blew my mind.

I loved the atmosphere, the menu (both food and wine) and found all of the staff to be engaging and knowledgeable. The size of the venue is perfect. Not huge or small by any means, but just right. The decor is organic and the atmosphere soothing.We left very pleased and I made a mental note to return, asap!   So, I did.  On the last Saturday in April, I brought my book club here (around 10-14 women in total) to discuss the book of the month. Our server, Nina, was amazing! I had made the reservation in the days prior to our arrival and found management to be extremely accommodating. I have hosted groups of different sizes in restaurants before (in San Diego, where we just moved from) and found this to be by far the best experience.   Fourteen women on different checks? No problem. I spent several years working in fine dining and was amazed at how Nina didn't even break a sweat. Everyone was so well attended to, we were able to completely focus on our discussion. I don't remember anyone wanting for anything. On top of this, the ladies raved about the atmosphere, the service, and the wine list and food were impeccable. On top of having the best server, the most accommodating management, the rest of the staff seemed equally personable. Another server stopped by our table several times, genuinely interested in our book club and sharing some very interesting tips on what he'd been reading.   I shared a bottle of Cab with another lady (woo hoo!) and ordered the french soup dumplings- yep, I said it, dumplings! They were exquisite. The woman next to me had the cheese plate, and my friend ordered smoked tomato bisque. WOW. I've been dying for a legit foodie experience and I think I can safely say that we all walked away extremely satisfied.  The only complaint I have is that I don't live closer- otherwise I'd certainly be a regular. There is no doubt that I'll be back, with or without the book club!   Thank you, Wooden Vine, for an excellent and memorable evening!",

    "text": "We were Uptown catching a show, walking back to our car, when we happened upon The Wooden Vine.  I was looking for a new place to have a small upcoming birthday gathering and, after peering in the window, The Wooden Vine looked like just the place.  It looked intimate, cozy, and a little classy.  Besides wine, it also offered appetizers for those in the party that might still be hungry after dinner.    We arrived for our small birthday gathering and stood near the bar, talking and having a great time.  I was very impressed with the decor, furniture, and ambiance of the wine bar.  The lighting was perfectly dimmed.  The carved wood bar and tables lent a unique, cozy feel.   It was even much nicer than I had remembered, just having peered inside the windows.    We went on a Tuesday night, and the bar was pretty slow, which was perfect for us.  We received fantastic, friendly service from our bartender and everyone got to sample different wines from their wine menu.  The prices were very reasonable, too.    All in all, it was a fantastic birthday experience and just what (if not a little more than) I was hoping.  Thanks, Wooden Vine!",

    "text": "I've been intrigued by Wooden Vine every time I walk by, but rarely had occasion to stop in. On a recent weekend evening I finally caved and decided to have a glass. My overall impression after one visit was \"meh.\"  Let's talk wine. They do have a pretty decently constructed wine list that represents most parts of the globe (though it did feel a little California heavy on my visit, not that there's anything wrong with Cali wines). I ordered a glass of a slightly obscure cabernet that I had not had before (since I like to try new things), and it was meh. The server really couldn't tell me anything about it before hand, but we'll get to the service in a minute.  First, let's talk about price.  Given that I work in the wine industry, I'm aware of the customary markups. But this list seemed a little on the pricey side, compared to what I'm used to. Could be that I'm a cheap date, or maybe it's the uptown atmosphere.  Which leads me back to the service. Aside from no one in the room really being able to talk intelligently about the wines I was considering when I asked,other than offering scant more than what the menu stated, we were met with a coldness from the staff that honestly made me a little uncomfortable.  I felt my presence was an inconvenience to them. Maybe it's a byproduct of serving mostly Center City banker-types and they are giving their usual crowd what they expect, but at the least a smile never killed anyone.  My opinion at this time, is that there are better options in the QC. I'll give it a couple months and try Wooden Vine again and see if my opinion is swayed.",

I felt $10 was a bit overpriced for the fondue dessert (although I admit I'm comparing to Melting Pot's chocolate fondues), but the wines were lovely and the staff was friendly without being intrusive. The rest of the menu looked good, so I'm hoping to go back and try some of the rest of the menu and give Wooden Vine a better rating.",

Without introducing herself she promptly told our group that they don't split checks, she wasn't attentive, she didn't offer dessert... And I wanted dessert. Great crowd? Nope, we were one of only 3 parties in the entire place but we still had bad service. After a huge check debacle, late food coming out when drinks were finished and the restaurant declining prepaid store gift cards.. We went to validate our parking ticket which they said was validated and when we got to the parking meter it was not and that was an extra cost to our already miserable night (icing on the cake that we weren't even offered). So thanks so much, Nadezda... Keep up the good work, NOT.",

I haven't gotten a chance to try any of the food yet but the wine and bottled beer menu is rather extensive.  The wife and I love stopping in here randomly and chatting over a glass of wine.  You should really give it a try.  I will update the review once I try the food.  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

There is an amazing wine list that always has super deals, they have a good beer selection and the tapas menu looked yummy (friends had the crab and corn dip and the potatoes, said both were great).    The decor is cool as well with natural wood all over and local artwork...was there this past Saturday and they had live music - the place was full of couples at tables, so it's a great date place, but also just singles at the bar and few groups of girls too...if you like wine, I highly recommend it, it's a nice quaint spot in Uptown that's a refreshing change from the intensity of the Epicentre.",

    "text": "NEW BRUNCH IS WORTH IT!  On Feb 23rd my friends and I were staying uptown for the weekend and had troubles finding a brunch on a Saturday without a cab ride. We found out that Feb 23rd was Wooden Vine's inaugural brunch! We were literally the first people in for an early seating. The server admitted they were still working out kinks, but rest assured the chefs were to not dissapoint. The food was divine and met the needs of our group (some hungover, some vegitarian, and all looking for a gourmet meal with good service). The meals came out somewhat staggered, but something we were able to look past since this was a 7 person party for the very first brunch served. Our waiter was upfront and we laughed it off. Will definately be back and even if you live in surrounding neighborhoods- it's worth your trip uptown!",
