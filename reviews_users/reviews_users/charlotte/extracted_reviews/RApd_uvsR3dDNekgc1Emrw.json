    "text": "I was a little skeptical of this place at first because there wasn't a bunch of people inside on a Saturday night, but we still gave it a shot.  Boy, were the people who weren't here missing out.  The prices were extremely reasonable, we're talking most of the menu being $16 and under and the house wines were $12, and that's $12 a bottle not a glass.  The voodoo shrimp was absolutely AMAZING, wow, and it came with a ton of shrimp, I've never seen a shrimp appetizer with this many shrimps before!  Now the main courses were outstanding as well.  The three of us got the chicken pasta, the filet, and some vegetable dish I cannot remember, but they came out in triangles and were really good.  The only thing I didn't absolutely love was the coconut rice, but I don't love coconut flavored things unless it's on a dessert.  Anyway, I will definitely be back here to try more items.  They also have fondue pot options which is really cool.  If you're looking for a great night, I highly recommend going here!",

    "text": "My husband and I went to boiling pot yesterday (I think I may have even seen the reviewer below me there?). The decor inside was very nice and elegant. A nice place for a special dinner even. The waitress was very nice, but I think the staff is still getting their rhythm- which I totally understand for a new place.   I ordered Boba Tea, the tapioca tasted fresh (it wasn't tough and rubbery, and still warm!) but the drink itself was very milky and had ice chunks in it versus being more of a smoothy consistency. Once again, this could just be the staff getting used to making them.  We got both beef and chicken broth. I was impressed by the varied selection of veggies - some different types of mushrooms you don't always see, cabbage, tomatoes, fish balls. We got beef and lamb to go in it. The fondue style was fun but we felt that the broths lacked flavor, so everything just felt like it had been boiled. In the future, I might try the spicy broths to see if they are better.  Despite the bumps though, I am excited about the concept (the place next door is also theirs, but with a more casual vibe, which I think is smart.) My husband and I will be back today to try the burgers. I really think it has alot of potential, so we will see!  Edit: We went back today to try the burgers and they were delicious. The meat was very well cooked and moist. We met the owner, who was very nice and attentive to my dietary restrictions, which I always appreciate. We will definitely come back for these. As for the hot pot, I think they should not worry about appealing to American tastes and just go for it!  Overall, I am glad we gave it a second go.",

    "text": "This is an interesting fusion of ideas. You can do a $25 all you can eat menu where you select everything you'd like - from noodle/rices, meats, veggies and choose the broth you'd like to boil it in. Basically Asian style food but in a French fondue style. The meats aren't your typical meats, but more like the consistency of beef carpaccio (and even looks like that) but I would definitely cook it. The vegetables are also have some different ones that I haven't seen at any Asian restaurant before - namely the mushrooms. The crab was quite small, wouldn't probably get that again. Be mindful that whatever you select they bring quite large portions of. If I go back I will probably say something like \"5 shrimp,\" or \"2 bok choy stalks\" otherwise its way more than you'll want to eat. The menu says they charge for oz's you don't eat, so just be careful not to over-order on the first go (we kind of did). All the broths were good, definitely changed the flavor of the food so I recommend getting a few for variety. They also have great prices for drinks, I was impressed!",

Nice wine list (which is extremely rare at any Asian restaurant).  5 stars my friends!!",

The meats were okay and so were the mussels. The rest I could do with out. This includes the fish square things, the scallops, the crab, and the seaweed. We didn't get what we ordered and we got things we didn't order. Our waitress wasn't around to explain what it was we were given and a manager passed by and try to explain but we are pretty sure he was wrong. Overall I would say stick to what you know you like and don't expect much help.  Husband liked the dinner mints, which were like Andes mints in stick form.",

The only criticism I have is the lack of hot oil at the table and their tap water would benefit from filtering.  The top tier quality of the ingredients more than offset those tiny issues, though.  Still five stars overall - and I rarely give 5 stars.  We had a split pot of szechuan and house bone broth.  Don't skip dessert or appetizers - they're house made, very good, and included in the reasonable hot pot price!  Carmel cheesecake was a perfect finish to a spicy meal.",

There are two private rooms in the back that you can also throw a get together at.  My sister ordered the steak burger medium done with a side of kimchi fries. I had a bite and it was delicious! I also had a pound of the Cajun boiled shrimp. For roughly $15 it was a bargain. The shrimp was fresh NOT frozen and portion was big enough to share as an appetizer for 3 people. We had a few other small plates as well.   Overall, I think it's a solid place. Nothing mind blowing but definitely a great place to have a drink and share appetizers with friends.

I asked for a Sprite instead and sadly I didn't notice until 10ish minutes later that there were approximately 15 ants floating around (photo attached.) The meal itself was decent (but for $27 per person, it could have been better.) Dessert was a disappointment. The cheesecake was still frozen, doughnuts were halfway cooked, and the portion sizes were incredibly small so we ordered more but it never arrived to our table (it was Monday night so it was not crowded at all.) The concept of the restaurant is cool, it just needs better management.",

    "text": "I heard about this place through the Nextdoor app so decided to do take out on a Friday night. It's located across from Hhgregg. When I arrived to pick up, the place looked pretty nice inside. The hostess was attentive. It was not very busy around 7:30pm. My order was waiting for me when I arrived. Once back at home, I was disappointed that the Five Cheese Mozzarella Croquettes that I ordered was nothing more than deep fried mozzarella sticks. Wow, such a fancy name on the menu! I like mozzarella sticks and my toddler loved them but let's be real and call it what it really is. We also tried to chicken pot stickers and the Kimchi wings which were both tasty.   I would go back to dine in for fondue or other menu items. The location is convenient and there aren't many good, non-chain restaurants in the Northlake mall area. Also, the bar looks like a cool place to hang out. They stay open until 2am on Friday and Saturday nights.",

The soup bases are alright, but I have had way better. Definitely get the szechuan and stay away from the kimchee broth. Not sure what they're trying to get at with the kimchee broth, but it does not taste anything like it should.   They give you good portions so don't order too much as they charge for leftovers. The service has always been great each time I dined here, so check it out!",

He said he would be right back and came and brought me my soda, along with an extra one for the inconvenience AND let me keep the sweet tea. He wasn't annoyed at all. So sweet! I will def be ordering from here again. The chicken wasn't rubbery, and they put a lot of sauce just how I requested. The lo mein was fresh not hard and old looking. Everything had wonderful flavor!!! Thank you!!",

A few hours after I left the restaurant I started feeling nauseas. I proceeded to vomit on and off for over an hour. It was so bad I had to have my friend pull over during traffic so I could continue to throw up. I typically have an iron stomach and never get sick from food. This restaurant has a cool concept, but unfortunately I will never go back. Both of my friends who are pregnant also felt ill after eating here today. We ensured that all of our food was very well cooked in the broth so we did not get ill from under cooked food.",

You get the table for two hours and there is a decent selection of veggies, meats, seafood, noodles, etc.  The service was really slow, despite it being nearly empty on a late Saturday night. I mean, seriously, how difficult and how long can it take to put uncooked items on a plate for you and walk it out? The owner and a bunch of servers were just standing around, chatting, watching TV and eating their dinner at the empty bar.  The owner wouldn't accept the $12 coupon that was printed in the Attractions coupon book. He claimed he didn't authorize its printing.

The restaurant just opened recently and there were no online reviews so decided we would give it a try.  Glad we did.  Greeted by a very nice hostess.  And was greeted by a number of employees/managers of the restaurant to ensure all was well.  We both were impressed with the way the wine was presented.  Although we were only having a glass of wine, the bar manager presented as if we were buying the bottle.  Great treatment and great wine.  Our server explained the concept of \"boiling pot\" which is similar to another \"pot\" fondue type restaurant.  We found this one to be very fresh, well prepared and absolutely very tasty veggies and meats.  We chose chicken broth and Sezchuan for our boiling pot.  we enjoyed the experience a lot.  and hopefully will get to visit again.",

The scallops we received were the tiny Bay scallops not the nice large sea scallops others posted. We also tried the mango ice.  And while it looked good in pics-the mango was good the ice tasted old and exposed(like when u leave something in freezer not wrapped and it makes the ice taste funny).

All of the staff on hand were attentive and eager to \"get it right.\"  We enjoyed a nice glass of wine (short on time) that was well presented at our table prior to serving.  The concept is fondue but if I recall correctly, the food is much better than the other restaurant of the same type.  We ordered the standard portion with chicken broth and Szechuan for our boiling pot without any extras (they were definitely not needed).  The broth was full of flavor.  We had plenty of food to fill our hungry bellies.  The staff explained the concept and how to manage our meal which was easy enough.  I particularly enjoyed dinner as the place was not crowded.  My guess is that with all of the tables filled and the bar seating filled, it would be loud and there would be a lot going on.  I would expect my next visit to prove this to be the case.  I look forward to visiting with the kids for a healthy meal with plenty of veggies.  I truly hope they keep the restaurant going strong so that patrons will want to return again and again.",

Having just moved back to the Charlotte area from a city in the cold parts of the Dongbei region of Northeastern China I am stoked to have a Huo Guo place here in Charlotte!   This place markets itself as an asian fondue place, but I would say for those of you who are unfamiliar with hot pot it is more like a Korean BBQ set up with a boiling soup/broth as the cooking method instead of a grill. The selection of food was amazing as well with lots of tofu options, lotus root, spinach, various meats, seafood, etc. This place is perfect for big groups or for families with picky eaters!   I will definitely be back when it gets a bit colder here in the region. Only thing that might be improved is the viscosity of the sesame paste dipping sauce, it was a bit too water for my tastes. Oh and I expected the noodles to not be pre-cooked as they became overcooked after being put in the broth. Over all though definitely a new favorite in the Charlotte area!",

I wonder if all hot pot restaurants use frozen food. I also ordered the flan an it was jello. As for the appetizers, I ordered one piece of each just to try it and it was definitely from a bag. They could have at least deep fried it so it could be crispy. I think they just microwaved it.   Best dish here was the salad. I love their salad. It tasted so fresh!   Customer service was good.

First we ordered drinks and the bartender told me I could get an entire bottle for just three dollars more than the glass. Yes please!!   The menu said there would be an extra charge if we didn't eat everything we ordered and you aren't allowed to take leftovers. This really put a lot of pressure on our choices and we didn't get to try as many things as we would have liked.   The pot finally came out along with our ingredients (incorrectly I should add) and it completely took forever to boil, turns out out whole setup was broken. Finally we got the ball rolling and the final product was just ok, the broth was a little bland. The best part really is the experience.   I would do hot pot again, but probably not here. The service was ok, they were friendly but messed up our order. And the food was mediocre and expensive. Fun experience though.",

    "text": "5 stars because you can pay $25 and get the entire menu BROUGHT TO YOU... like a clean buffet line.   Choose 1 broth or 2. You know what?? Why am I writing all this? No one will read it or at least I didn't read the reviews before entering but I did read when they first came up I was enamored enough to bookmark the place.   Here's the deal:  JUST GOOOO It's perfect for *the picky eaters, *folks trying to engage in conversation and not feel left out on the other end of table;   *wedding rehearsals, * sorority/fraternity functions as an official meeting (they have private rooms) or a social function,  * a party of 1 - 4 as the tables are intimate enough and large enough to hold everything that will be brought on separate plates (make sure you ask for a bowl in case you make pho soup with the PHO broth).   Think Melting Pot without limits. The photographs of lobster and snow crab clusters, like a previous Yelper mentioned, is a stock photo and not what you will get. The little blue crabs sliced in half are clean though and hold flavor well.   I never got any chicken nor shrimp which is weird for me but I will say that PHO broth is something worth trying or writing home about. I made my own Pho and wished they had BASIL; alas, they do not.   The soda tastes like it came from the bar wand but it didn't. Quite flat.  Bottle of wine on each table.  Silverware inconsistent and nonmatching at our table.   Oh, ask them to cook the wings twice. Even with the undercooked redness - I wasn't turned off. Just asked for a longer fry and it was good to go.   The crab ragoons are just great. I tried to make my own before dining here and will let you know mine had real crab and cream cheese and was still crappy. So this works for me as I don't just roll out to the chinese restaurants like i used to while in undergrad.   The server didn't write down things we ordered and forgot a number of items so keep a paper menu with you so you don't forget what is next or what you ordered.",

Instead you mark the items you want on a sheet of paper and the server brings it out. You get one pot to share at the table so only go with people you don't mind double dipping with - those are the only kind of peeps I roll with anyway ;) We chose Szechuan and Kimchi broth. The former was delicious but I didn't care for the latter. You also get a variety of sauces to mix and make your own. Ask the server for suggestions if you're unsure of how to make the sauce. The quality of the meats, vegetables and seafood were amazing. Just be mindful of ordering because you'll be charged for wasting too much food. You definitely get your money's worth here.

    "text": "The food was good, but I don't know if that is worthy of a great rating.  First of all, you have to find this tucked away place, GPS is probably necessary.  But once you walk inside you see a pretty nice layout for this side of town.  Once seated they will give you a huge menu.  I'm pretty sure our server was new as she recommended the hambugers.....?  I asked about the wings next as kind of a joke, but she didn't get it.  I went on to ask about the Italian pasta dishes, which she still didn't get, but I quit picking on the menu for a while after that.  At 27.50 a person for the hot pot, there is just no way my mom was going to eat near that amount of food to make it worth while.  Plus, there were conflicting messages on how long you had to eat it, some said an 1.5 hours, some said 2 hours, and then on top of that you were charged for excess wasted food.  All of this just seemed to complicated and expensive so we went with some an app and 2 entrees.  The food took quite some time.  I was asked if I wanted a refill on my water before we even got our apps, I thought that was a little odd, of course I will want something to drink with my food.  The edamame came out, with no bowl to put the shells in, so I dirtied up my plate, I guess that was the right call.  Then our entrees came out.  My mom got the salmon that came with some shrimp, a great deal, and pretty tasty.  I got the crab cakes entree which turned out to be just one very small crab cake.  Not anywhere close to an entree.  I'm glad I took the option to add a signature salad for $3.  The crab cake was a little doughy, but not bad, and the sauce for it was excellent.  After eating half of my moms food I was full and eventually was able to ask for the check.  For some reason my crab \"cakes\" were twice the price they were supposed to be.  I brought this to the attention of our server and she said she'd have to go talk to somebody.  She came back and told us it was because of the salad and we kind of went back and forth for a while.  It was pretty weird, she kept saying it was a $3 up charge for the salad, even though we were being overcharged by $9.  I kept having to try and teach this girl basic math until I think she finally got it.  I still tipped her well, even after all that.  I did see some others with hot pots, and the food looked solid.  I just don't think this expensive all you can eat fashion is going to work on this side of town.  If it was a basic one for $19.95 and you could add the expensive crab and such for a higher cost it might work out better.  Or what most hot pot places I've been to do is charge like $8-10 for the broth and then you just a la carte the meat and veggies.  It would probably work out to more than $27.50 for the people who just came to stuff their face and lighter eaters would still be patrons.  I don't know, not my restaurant.  If I'm super hungry one day, I'll probably come back and try it, but not until then.",

    "text": "It was 9 o'clock last night we decided to have dinner and we had a party of four. I was not all that impressed. Its expensive for the quality of the food that they are giving out. While i was there I'm hoping am wrong, but I notice something strange. The older gentleman who I think might be the owner was going around the table after the customer left which there were 3 table gone. He picked up only the plate that had food they can reused. He took back the veggies, seafood, and some meats plates. Which all look like they hadn't been touch or eaten. He would go back and forth to get the plates that still looked untouched many times. He also picked up a plate of mussles and drain the water into the pot and took it back with him. After he got what he needed a waitress came with a cart to pick up the rest of the stuff. I think thats something that needs to get looked at and investigate. Because we are paying a lot for the food, which now am thinking are used products from left over customers. Our waiter was so slow and forgot everything we had put on the list. Whats the point of having us mark our food on the list when they still come ask us what we ordered??. I dont understand, its not like i remember everything i marked. Then our food came all different times. I didn't get my rice or ramen noodles until we were almost done. The waiter kept saying their making it, but never came. I was trying to be patient, but its just crazy how they operate. He never onced asked how we are doing. If we needes anything. It was always us asking for our drink refills, and all the other items we ordered. The staff aren't friendly, the place is dirty, service is slow. I don't recommend anyone to go there. Especially now that I saw what the owner was doing makes me think twice about even going there. If they dont want to waste food, don't put so much out there. Its just gross to think about it.",

For all you can eat value, if you eat plenty, it's fantastic.  The spicy soup and kimchee souls were loaded with sodium and artificial flavor, I got thirsty before the end of meal.  The kurobota pork was the best meat of all follow by the beef and lamb.  The tongue was alright, would be better if it's shaved thinner.  Beef tendon ball was fine, had not bouncy one elsewhere.  Fish ball with filling was fine.  Tripe and octopus  were fantastic and so was the clam.  All the veggie and mushroom  were nice and fresh.  Like I said, if you are a big eater, this is of great value.  The only negative I had was that giant Keno screen.  Would be better if it's on a small screen and give the big screen to a sports program or something.",

    "text": "My s/o and I are massive fans of the other fondue spot up I-77 (The Melting Pot) so we decided to give this place a shot after reading about it. I made reservations for a Thursday night at 7 PM and went in excited despite reading completely mixed reviews. This place is tucked in a shopping plaza right by Northlake Mall and an easy find. As soon as we walked in, it was relatively dead and the greeter didn't even bother asking anything besides saying \"2?\" We nodded and he was off to seat us, not even giving me the opportunity to say we had reservations. We were seated in a room right behind the hostess stand with another family of 4. The table seated four and the burner was in the center. Our waitress Ada was friendly, but definitely wasn't going out of her way to answer any questions we had. We did the all-you-can-eat option and the slip of paper is pretty much order as you please. We asked about quantity for portion sizes and our waitress pretty much told us that only applies to things such as egg rolls and spring rolls, nothing else really mattered.  From the bites tab, we ordered crab rangoons, kimchi fries, voodoo shrimp, and fried chicken gyoza. I ordered a 2 piece of each the Szechuan ma-la and sweet chili chicken wings. For the rest, we got: chicken breast, angus beef, angus filet mignon, dumplings, shrimp (peel shrimp), baby bok choy, corn on the cob, spinach, enoki mushrooms, fried tofu, and ramen noodles. Our broth selection was Szechuan and tom yum. Now all that is out of the way, let's get into the food. The first thing to come out was the broth base with the veggies, shrimp, fried tofu, ramen noodles, and dumplings. Followed by that were the meats, voodoo shrimp, fried gyoza, and crab rangoons. The last thing to come out was the chicken wings. Let me start out by saying that the pictures of ice blocks of frozen seafood are 100% True. The shrimp were mini ice cubes and did thaw nicely when in the broth. Also frozen were the meats, dumplings, and fried tofu. Out of everything frozen, the only thing that was not appetizing was the fried tofu (very spongy and loses that fried taste when frozen and then thrown in hot liquid).   To start, our waitress forgot the kimchi fries (forgetful waitstaff noted before as well), and with all the food we didn't even bother asking. The veggies all were delicious as were the voodoo shrimp (AMAZING) and dumplings. The crab rangoons and fried gyoza were below average quality, with both wings being subpar as well. The meats cooked nicely in the broths but the obvious better of the two was the Szechuan. The tom yum was flavorful, but a bit watery. The ramen came out warm, but we let it sit and it became one cohesive mass. We tossed it in the broth and within minutes it was ready to go. We finished with cinnamon sugar and sugar donuts (order is 2 of each) as we finished out our meal.   Tips and other thoughts: When ordering bites, definitely go for the voodoo shrimp (you get about 8-10 mini fried shrimp per order). The angus filet was much leaner and had a buttery quality. If you like fattier meats give the angus beef a shot, but nothing too out of the ordinary. The chicken would be my only for sure skip. The dumplings plumped up in the soup base and were phenomenal and the veggies had a wonderful flavor when soaked in the veggies (especially the enoki mushrooms). While the shrimp came out frozen, they did cook up nice and had a nice flavor. My overall tip would be to wait until the end for the ramen noodles so they can absorb all the flavors of the meal. Pull them out and top with broth and you have a wonderful, flavorful mini bite to end your experience. The donuts were good but VERY dense and not very sweet.   Overall: 4/5 (7.5/10) Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Atmosphere: 2.5/5",

We had talked hot pot up to friends so much that we decided to go here.   Sadly we found ourselves disappointed in this place, and I think our friends were turned off from it. The broth was pretty good but the meats were not the highest quality. We ordered some seafood items and they were brought to our table frozen! We will not be returning to this restaurant.",

    "text": "So I just found out that China Go Go and boiling pot are a sister company! They have a location here and pineville!  We went here for the all you can eat hot pot.  First the prices at this location is 26.99 and the other location is 21.99  This location has many more options in the ayce hot pot such as appetizers and wings and more beef options and seafood options like blue crab, scallops, and crawfish. They also have fried dough which I definitely recommend when eating hot pot!   We got the house, Szechuan, miso, and tom yum broths.  The Szechuan broth didn't have much flavor but spice and the miso broth is not the same as the other location which I love but here it tastes like beer but it tasted better throughout as we added things to flavor the broth. But I definitely recommend getting tom yum and house! Our server was very nice and also gave us recommendations on what to get. She ordered us the popcorn shrimp appetizer with spicy mayonnaise which was very delicious. The quality of the meat is your standard ayce meat.  I don't recommend getting the premium beef because they slice it very thick and it ends up being chewy. At the end they have desserts which were standard and nothing too special. But there was a server who was white with blonde hair and I was asking about one of our orders and she sassed me and said we don't have enough hands and that is why I deduct one star but our main waiter with the amazing brows was very sweet to us.  Overall, the price is incredible and the food is delicious. Would recommend!",

We ended up sitting in the very back kind of a private area of the restaurant. Nice and quiet so perfect for a relaxing evening.   So it's a flat fee for each adult. Around $27 for all you can eat shabu shabu. When you pick a broth, they have pots that can do a single or two broths so you can taste a bit of both (we got the house and the sezchuan) . They have a ton of sauces, veggies and meats to add to the broth.  Other bonus is the all you can eat appetizers. Spring rolls were good, spicy edamame was a bit messy, and the dumplings were decent. As an add on, they have a reasonably priced wine and sake menu.   Overall, this was a good experience and perfect dinner before a movie.",

The service is lacking though, but they bring you SO much food that you really don't need them often.  I did find that they actually bring you too much of each item, especially when you only requested 1 serving. This was most evident in the seafood - marking \"1\" for shrimp, calamari, and crab sticks resulted in 15 shrimp, 15 calamari rings, and I lost count of the crab sticks after 15. (We were actually worried we were going to be charged for the uneaten food!)  I think a better model would be to bring out smaller portions, but increase your staff so they can bring more if needed.  They are wasting so much food, otherwise.   Apparently the crab legs are popular. We saw many tables eating that exclusively and was told it was delicious. (I doubt anyone will complain about too many of those!) You can definitely come for a low country boil here, which admittedly is strange to say for a hot pot--but it is the south!",

    "text": "My expectations about this place were way too high, especially after reading the reviews and for the price you pay for the Asian fondue experience. When I got there with my husband the hostess was on the food with someone, there were also a guy in front of us waiting to be seated with two kids and after us a party of 5 arrived. The hostess took her sweet time on the phone then started sitting everybody. To start I did not like the way the tables are organized. We were like on the corner of a room that we had no access to our waitress. Very secluded spot. The waitress asked for our drinks and gave us the menu, she came back after a good while asking if we were ready to order, so we did. We ordered miso and the House broth,  steak, chicken, shrimp, mussels, octopus, squid, ramen and watercress that was never served. The shrimp was frozen, what places serve frozen sea food? They didn't even care about thawing the shrimp. We ordered spring rolls, crab Rangoon, chicken wings and the voodoo shrimp as appetizer which surprisingly arrived only after we were almost done with our food. Besides we had to remind the waitress about the voodoo shrimp that she forgot.  The miso broth was so salty I barely could eat. Talking about salty when my chicken wings arrived I couldn't believe in what I was seeing. They were over fried, dried and white, YES, white with all the salt they poured on top of my wings. I don't think they calculate the portions correctly, I ordered chicken for one person and they sent us chicken for at least two people. Take in mind if you don't eat all your food you have to pay for the leftovers. Even though we had many disappointments we were willing to go back to try something from their regular menu but things just started getting worse! They waitress simply disappeared, my husband and another customer had to leave to look for her and she was nowhere to be found. I wanted to eat dessert but since the waitress disappeared my husband again tried to find her without success. So we decided to pay, but how could we if there was nobody to receive the payment? Was just like a ghost town! The hostess appeared so we could pay and leave. I have never been so frustrated! I have been to so many restaurants and never had this lack of service or food before. We spent almost $100 on something that wasn't worth even half! I will never go back to this place and I will advise my friends to keep distance.  PS: the crab Rangoon was the only decent thing we had.",

    "text": "My first Hot Pot experience! It appears that this is getting popular all around the US and this place has the advantage of seemingly being the only Hot Pot in Charlotte.  Walked in for dinner here a couple of nights ago, it appears that they're short-staffed because the hostess introduced herself as not only the manager but also our waiter! She went over the menu and the hot pot options and we had already decided what we wanted before we got there. HOT POT!  Chose the Miso and the Pho broth. We got a couple each of crispy wings, hot wings, egg rolls, crab rangoon, and edamame. For the main course we got beef tenderloin strips, pork belly, meatballs, calamari, shrimp, crab clusters, and several veggies.  I was happy with both broths, but the flavors of the miso transferred to the food better. The pho had a great taste alone, but only subtly seasoned the food as it cooked. The only thing we were unhappy with was the crab clusters: not much meat in any of them, and what meat we got lacked any sort of flavor. All the other meats were great.  A couple of setbacks of the night were that our manager/hostess/server/everything in between was so busy trying to bus the many tables, it caused our service to be a bit lacking. Not really any fault of her own, but they definitely needed more staff that night. Our drinks were constantly empty and the rice and ramen as part of the hot-pot didn't come out until we requested it a second time, same goes for all the dipping sauces.  All in all a positive experience, a bit of polishing and this could be a real statement restaurant for a unique cuisine experience.",

I got shrimp and crab and the crab was frozen and which I didn't mind. That was until I ate it and the smell was over powering in the fish department and as any seafood lover knows, that's a big no for seafood. The shrimp was okay. The fried rice I ordered tasted old and just not right. Overall I would not recommend this place if you are going for the hot pot, not sure about any other menu items.",

You then cook everything right there yourself. It is a fun experience but it wasn't impressive.  I had hot pot while I was in China and it was fantastic, tons of flavors and it was a great experience so when I moved to Charlotte I wanted to take my wife for a fun night out.   The problem was...well a few things. The food was low quality, the broth needed more flavoring and we were not impressed. I kept ordering more food to try and find that \"tasty\" bite but I never could and left disappointed. You do get tons of food though so that's something but with it being such poor quality I will not be back.",

They do have some other items on the menu for those who don't want the hot pot experience. The restaurant is decent-sized. We went in before 6pm on a Sunday and there was hardly anyone there, but by the time we left it was at least half filled.  As for the hotpot, it's $27.50 per person for the all you can eat experience. The tables have built-in flat cook tops which is convenient, and a little safer than the open flame portable propane stoves you see at other places. To order, they have a sheet where you can mark down the soup base and the ingredients. We got the half spicy and half non spice soup base. The soup base was okay, but the spicy side is not all that spicy. There is a pretty good selection of ingredients to choose from, including veggies, seafood, tofu, fish/meat balls, noodles, and of course sliced meats. We ordered a little too much and couldn't finish everything, because some of the items came in a larger quantity than we thought. It's a good idea to ask before putting in the order. All the ingredients were fresh and the meat and oysters tasted great. I also like that they include plenty of sauces for you to mix and dip your food in.   We stuffed ourselves during that dinner. The price is not cheap, but the food was good, and if you have a big appetite it could be worth it.",

Let's say I'm an omnivore, rather than just straight vegetarian. Yes, this place is vegetarian friendly, but the meat is where it's at.   This place is all you can eat. You get a burner in the middle of table, you pick your broth, then they bring you your pot and whatever you want to eat. It's sort of like kbbq (if you've ever had it), except it's all hot pot and with broth.  So why the 4 stars and not 5? Well, the serving staff is just alright, sub par. I mean it's pretty easy to bring drinks to people, but as Asian parents are... They like tea or hot water. And they bring the hot water in a pint glass. Would you bring your coffee or tea in a pint glass? No? Then why would you bring hot water in a pint glass? On top of that, we sit waiting for someone to pick up our selections for our hot pot... And well, all the waiters disappear and we don't see anyone? Interesting.   I'm all for all you can eat hot pot. It's nice not to have to prepare it and wash all those dishes, but the service was just not there. This changed when we talked to the owner and well, our waiter came back. We asked if she was our waiter and, she responded that she \"thinks so\"... Confusion the owner comes back and explains she was trying to submit homework. Hmm. So now instead of a waitress, we have the owners come serving us. If they get the service down pat, no doubt this place will be a 5 star experience.   The hot pot food is great! It's something that I've grown up with eating and it's authentic. The only difference is that we don't have to do all the dishes along with the preparation! If you're looking for a new experience, along with a taste of Taiwan, this is the place to go. Great for groups and also for people with an appetite.",

    "text": "Recently ventured out for my birthday dinner with a group. They're excellent for a group as they have a party room. Karaoke is included if the tab overall is over $200. You'll get a free 3hrs to sing your heart out! Although, if you plan to make reservations for a large group or overall, make sure you phone in. They don't check their online request.   They have large portions overall. For entrees, it could feed two persons. With that said, make sure you ask plenty of questions if you're considering doing hotpot. Any extras leftovers will be charged if over 8oz. If you have a large group, make sure to keep tabs on what your ordered for hot pot and it can get confusing whose is what.   Hotpot comes with appetizers such as crab ragoons, spring rolls, egg rolls, voodoo shrimp (similar to bang bang shrimp but smaller and less sauce). Also included are options of salad and desserts such as donuts, flan and cheesecake. If it's your first time doing hot pot, make sure to save noodles for last as they're really filling and tend to soak up the broth. I like their spicy broths. The house is plain and simple.     Employees were very polite and courteous. Overall a wonderful experience.",

My kids had sesame chicken and wonton soup, which they said were fine, nothing special.  I had the boiled shrimp and crawfish meal, thinking I'd be healthy-ish :)  The food, which came out about 10 minutes after my kids food, was sitting in what looked to be 2 sticks of melted butter!  I gave up on the potatoes, they were saturated, but ate what I could of the shrimp and crawfish.  Both were in shells so weren't totally soaked through, but it was a messy dish.  They provided gloves to eat it, but it was just too much butter.    I'd get the dish again, specifying no butter.  We'll give them another chance at dinner to try the hot pot, as well.",

Overpriced per person bland tasting food is how I would describe this experience.",

Well we finally got here and overall I'd say it was worth it. Great Szechuan soup that was actually spicy. Lowkey both cuts of the pork were the best meats to get.

It was lightly fried shrimp, broccoli, onions, red peppers and zucchini.  My only criticism is that the shrimp could have been a little thicker by comparison to the tempura, but still delicious.  Side note- I also ordered the egg rolls and they were yummy too. Way more food than expected, which could be good or bad.  The both items were just under $11.00 - total.  I can't think of a time when I've received something that good and cheap.  It's obviously been a while. Service was great and quick.  No complaints.    Other guests looked happy and stuffed too.",

    "text": "Been to many hot pot restaurants from North Carolina to California and this was one of my least favorite. Service was pretty much non-existent, food quality was mediocre and no sauce station? What?! Unheard of.   We saw that there wasn't a sauce station so we ordered some sauces from the menu, they NEVER came and we didn't see our waitress until the end of the meal and at the point the sauce was no longer needed.  Yes, they give you some basics like Chinese bbq sauce, garlic, very watered down peanut sauce, onions and soy sauce but where was the vinegar? Ponzu? Sesame oil? Oh and order what you want at the beginning because they won't be back to ask you if you want anything more.   What was really mind boggling was the frozen solid seafood. The meatballs were frozen together in a block of ice, the oysters are the frozen kind you get from the Korean market in a freezer section and the shrimps were the frozen kind too. The shrimps had no flavor at all. The beefs we ordered were okay but the pork belly was not good.   Crab Rangoon was decent but the gyoza needed seasoning on the meat. It's sad to say that at a hot pot restaurant the only decent thing was the crab Rangoon. If you don't know hot pot, this place will probably do. But if you do, you'll be disappointed. If you do go, don't forget to get the veggie essentials for the your hot pot: watercress, tong ho, baby bok choy and Chinese cabbage.",

We also ordered all you can eat crab legs. Crab legs were way too salty the first round. So I asked if they can cut the seasonings and just butter. 2nd and 3rd round. There's an oil seasonings in the crab legs. I just prefer the legs to be plain and to have butter come with it but that didn't happen.   Customer service: 4/5 Because it seem like they were short handed. All of our ladies were having a hard time to be tentative to any particular table. A lot of the table have more than 4 guests. And it seem like they only have about 3 waitresses running around with their heads cut off. The time they spent was us was great but it's hard to get their attention later when need be.   Food: 4/5 beside the seasonings on the crab legs. Everything else was great.   This is a good place for groups gathering. You cook and chat with friends  I will recommend this place for that!",

I'm pretty sure it was the owner that was our server/bartender, when we got there he was sitting at bar close to door we walked in, no greeting just awkward stare than just got up and disappeared for a split second and poof became the bartender.  Walking up to us as if he didn't see us walk in or care to serve us no hello no smile just \"what can I get you\" well we can start with a menu.  After ordering a craft local beer which he only had one of and seemed confused where to find them if there were any left. So we went with the safe bet and ordered a Corona which he served with a quarter of a lime which was like pulling teeth to get into the bottle, lmbo!  We planned on eating dinner there but the vibes were just not right! With only one table occupied and two people at this extremely large bar, not to mention on a Thursday night, I was a little nervous to eat because of product rotation!  Maybe we came at the wrong time or day but still was very weird vibes. I can't explain it, just awkward! Lol This place is very close to our home and pass it often and wanted to try it out...unfortunately because of the awkward service we will not return. I did give this place 3 stars because honestly didn't eat here so food could be good? I will never know.... We did order Kimchi Fries and they were good just basic fries tossed in kimchi...my husband thought the oil tasted bad but I liked them. On a end note going to the bathroom was a weird experience felt like I was in someone's home with luggage in hallway, and the bathroom in shambles. Different bottles of cleaning products and hand soaps half empty everywhere. Extremely Different Experience For Sure!",

Our waitress took our drink orders then came back with the house sauce then took our order. Ok so far the services was ok but then it started to go down hill they took forever to bring out our food when the table in front of us came after us, they didn't give us some of the other we order and gave us the wrong one. Then they never check up on us. We wanted to ordered more but had to flag someone else to get our waitress which we already been waiting over 20 min. Also took forever to get the check so if you want customer services don't go here. The food was a decent for the price. I think I spent more time waiting then actually eating. I wouldn't recommend anyone to this place",

    "text": "This was my first hot pot experience and even though I may not be well versed in all that is hot pot I am sure that this was not an exemplary experience. My first issue was with service. Our waitress came to us once for our entire stay. Since she only showed up to take our initial order, we were not given the opportunity to order more food or drinks- which we had every intention of doing but alas...their loss I suppose.   The food.  Oh boy. Our seafood came out frozen. Not lightly frozen...but in blocks. Meaning we could not separate the meat kind of blocks. The beef came out partially thawed and the pork belly was no bueno.   The noodles we ordered came out already cooked which I learned is a no-no for hotpot as the point is for them to sit in the broth and gain flavor as they cook.   The saving grace here were the veggies. We ordered watercress, tong ho, baby bok choy and Chinese cabbage. I truly think this added a ton of flavor to the broth. We managed to eat majority of our food (because you will be charged extra for wasted food) solely because we were able to work with the Chinese barbeque sauce/garlic/scallions that were given at the beginning of our meal. We ordered extra sauces but they never came.  I wish it was better as it is the only place to get hot pot in the Charlotte area. Hopefully they will make improvements soon...",

We ordered four different meals and everyone was satisfied. Dinner serving sizes we're lunch the next day.

I've not been to a hot pot place before, so it was a nice experience to cook our food. They give you a choice of two broths to cook your food and it flavors it. We had tom yum and Szechuan. Both were good. We had all sorts of veggies and beef and shrimp. They also brought some ingredients you could use to make sauce to dip in. Watercress, seaweed and book choy were great. We had the angus beef and shrimp. We also had the dumplings. Not too salty. Amazing peanut sauce.   I highly recommend this place. A great place for a date. I would not bring kids here.",

I've ordered hot tea& water as well as the tempura shrimp and Mongolian beef with fried rice for my entree. I think there are only 2 people here that I can see.  (12/11/18) Another late night supper, why I thought that the tempura shrimp might have been the only huge appetizer I'll never know. I ordered shrimp shumai to start and udon noodles with pork as my entree. The shumai were about twice the normal size and were about two bites each. Where any other restaurant would have brought out 6 Boiling Pot gives you nine! I finished them. When the udon arrived I seriously questioned why I had ordered an appetizer at all. I managed to eat maybe a quarter of what arrived and the rest went into a take away box for breakfast and lunch tomorrow. Good tasting food and huge portions, what's not to like?",

They said they were missing a lot of food they ordered. None of the dishes were removed as they piled up.  The desert was great, but we had to use the same fork we ate the seafood with, so it was a little fishy.",

    "text": "Okay. Okay. I know I've praised a few hot pot places in the past but this place is it. I don't even bother going to hot pot places anymore in Georgia because I've found this place. Their broth is so flavorful, their menu is huge with delicious appetizers, and their services is always great. The portion they bring out is a lot so don't get too eye hungry and order a bunch of stuff at once since you are encouraged to eat everything you order. If you are new and want to try several items, write on your menu that you want half the order. My boyfriend and I always get the Szechuan broth and Tom yum broth. At the end we always get a cheesecake. Its a hit or miss with the cheesecake and its always frozen when it arrives so I recommend ordering it earlier in the meal to let it thaw. I know that's horrible but everything else is great so I won't let that affect how I feel about this place. I tell everyone about this place because I NEED them to stay in business. Hot pot isn't that popular yet around here. Aside from hot pot, they have another menu. I've never seen it though because I only come here for one thing. I did see one guy order a whole bowl of crayfish at the bar to watch a game. Give this place a try! They have things on the menu for everyone, even kids!",

    "text": "This location looks like an American bar, just like Buffalo Wild Wings. There are many seats on bar with HD TVs on the top. But what it attracts me is their Chinese style hot pot. They have hot pot all you can eat that costs you about $27 per person. It is not cheap but there is no doubt that it is THE BEST hot pot you can find in the grand Charlotte area. That price gives you many different flavors wings, many choices of appetizers such as my favorite Chinese green beans, tons of choices of vegetables, mushrooms and seafood, chicken, lamb, different types of beef and the dessert! And they are all very fresh. The service is very good. Dishes are served very quickly. Several tips for you: 1. We first asked them to prepare a medium spicy base soup, but it is not spicy at all and it is not so tasty. We then asked the server to put more spicy in the soup, after that, it became super good. 2. At the beginning, the server told us that we have 2 hours for the buffet. You might want to not chat too much while eating since you want to concentrate! Since they serve the dishes very quickly, it is not a problem for us to completed within 2 hours. But I personally don't like the rule. 3. Don't order too much in a single time since the table won't be that big to hold all the plates. Order again when nearly finished, and they serve it within minutes (like 1 or 2 min today, really quick).",
