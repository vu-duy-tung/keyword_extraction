I love the tossed Greek (with no onions) or the chicken roll ups or the tomato soup and Greek salad combo. I mix their sweet tea and the hibiscus tea for a favored sweet blend. I've also used call ahead for pick up and ordered online.",

Unfortunately, as of 3/10/14 they are still trying to iron out their grand opening kinks.  We were there at lunch and it took a good 15-20 minutes to get our food.  My chicken roll ups were not prepared correctly and the potato salad (which is normally my favorite fresh side!) was drowning in their dressing.  The staff and management were aware of the timing issues and comped our meal without us even asking which was greatly appreciated.  Customer service goes a very long way!  If I'm ever back in the area, I will definitely stop in and give them another try.  I'm sure with some time and experience under their belts they will get things up to normal Zoe standards!",

    "text": "First let me say if this review was for the food only I would give it 3 stars.  The hummus and white bean side were both yummy, quinoa salad was spot on and the beef rollups were really good as well.  The only dud was the tuna pita which didn't seem very fresh.  Tuna was slightly strange tasting and the wheat pita was extremely hard.  My overall experience though was horrible! I used the online ordering feature to place my to-go order.  The app itself is great and gives you lots of options to customize your food.  It went downhill from there.  I placed the order at 12:45 and was given a 1:10 pick up time.  I arrived shortly after 1:10 and was told they were bagging my order. After waiting for 10 minutes they then informed me that they hadn't received the order which they later retracted and said the order wasn't ready.  After harassing and hounding the counter staff I had my order at 1:40!  The girl behind the counter (Emily - per my receipt) was extremely apologetic and refunded my money as well as gave me a coupon for a free entree.  There were 3 people in the kitchen with only 1 that appeared to be cooking. The other individual behind the counter who may have been the manager did nothing to help the situation. There were a lot of people waiting at the register and even more people waiting for food in the restaurant.  Clearly short staffed and bad management.  Be forewarned if you go here you will need more patience than I have.",

I have to give kudos to Eric how hand delivered a free goodie after I was overcharged during my last visit. Thank you!  Some notes of interest: The staff is extremely friendly The food is extremely fresh and tasty The Zoe's app/online ordering is AWESOME They have an outdoor seating area overlooking the Southpark towers fountain, Fairview Rd and the SouthPark Mall (and yes, there are umbrellas for shade) They serve beer and wine They offer cheap refills if you purchase the Zoes cup They reward you for loyalty when you submit your Zoes receipts (you get goodies!)  Don't let the lines scare you off. There are lines because the food is delicious and they have an awesome location for a lot of office workers that just walk to get their lunch. If you're in a hurry and just need to quickly pick something up, order ahead, and get in the special line for to-go orders, where you simply confirm your order and pick it up. They do not charge your card until you arrive and pick up your food, so you can pay with alternative methods or add things on if you like.  Also, they have the best Greek salad I've ever eaten, it's delicious! My favorite is the Tossed Greek Salad, that comes with grilled chicken and onions, and pasta salad over the salad. Don't worry carb-avoiders, you can subsitute or remove the pasta salad!  Reminder: Submit your receipts using the zoes app for free goodies!",

Got something I did not order and several items I ordered were missing.  Too late and too much trouble to return to the store (plus we were hungry), so we ate what we got.  It was good, but not what we paid for.  Later I went on-line to provide feedback (which they enthusiastically ask for), told them about my experience.  3 weeks and I have heard nothing.

I called ahead to speak to Meghan - the manager of the place, to reserve a farewell lunch for 24 on Saturday and she was so accommodating. Unfortunately she said they could not reserve tables and seats ahead of time for guests as it is a first come first serve basis, but they did allow us to come early to reserve tables and seats that Saturday. They told us to give them heads up so that our food would be ready as soon as we ordered it. Ashley and Melissa were great that Saturday we got there. They provided prompt service and was extremely accommodating to all of our needs from extra plates to catering trays and tongs for our large party of 24. Excellent service, food and location!!",

Apparently they decided to keep the salad the same price and literally cut the portion in half, if it's even that much. This is not a $10 salad it's a joke now. Sorry Zoes you just lost a customer. No I won't be back to the new and not improved Zoes. They should have raised the price and kept it how it was, I would have at least been willing to pay for that.",

A favorite of ours are the salmon kebabs and the chicken salad sandwich. The white beans are some of the best I've ever had and the pasta salad is fantastic. Also, you cannot forget to get a chocolate chip cookie...they're awesome! Honestly, I can't really think of a bad experience we've had with them. Food is always cooked, hot, and tastes fresh. The service is fine, nothing out of the ordinary. Overall cleanliness is good. Zoe's is a favorite stop of ours when visiting down South!",

I can't believe I've neglected reviewing this location for so long honestly, as it was my first regular spot to partake of their wonderful Greek inspired eats.  The menu has changed only a tad since I first started coming here. They still have one of my personal favorites from the days of old: the orzo tabouli salad. I would get it with chicken kebab skewers. I'd also get the quinoa salad with kebabs. There's a very delicious, very simple \"protein Power plate\" that's a grilled chicken breast on a bed of cabage and onions. Superb if you're doing a Paleo diet or something like it.  Prices can be a bit high, especially when you consider most of this stuff could easily be made at home with a little effort and ingenuity. But they have a lock on flavor. If you're a dieter or calorie counter, this is also a great place to eat. Vegetarians, vegans, gluten and dairy sensitive will similarly not be too disappointed with the options.and if you want a sweet treat, there are some monster cookies on the counter tempting you as you order. \"Oh okay I'll have one!\"",

    "text": "So this restaurant has some great healthy options to choose for a good lunch or dinner meal. Tends to the Greek/ Mediterranean style of food, so if that is what you like, this place is great for you. I enjoyed my meal, everything tastes good, decor is nice and lots of options. I had a Mediterranean lentil soup..very good! And chicken pita with Greek side salad. My husband also had a Greek salad with lamb kebobs...done medium well, cooked to his liking! No problems with the food, so I would recommend. There is free parking structure nearby and and accessible ramp into the establishment for easy access. What I definitely did not appreciate during my visit was the girl who took my order. She was extremely unprofessional, very angry about something... slamming doors and storming around like an immature kid... I felt like I was being rushed to make an order, and then had to watch her fume the entire time I was there.  Needless to say, I was really looking forward to having a great experience at Zoe kitchen as there were good reviews on the food. And my food was tasty, but I was very uncomfortable, ate as quickly as I could and hightailed it out of there!  My star rating dropped to 3 because of the experience I had... Note to management: please, please service is very important, and nasty attitudes need to be put in check! Note to everyone else: it's worth a try for the food options. Hopefully you get better service experience than I did.",

They always seem short staffed so quick dinner is definitely not what you get, the quality of food is not up to par and as of lately always seem to be out of something, if not a few items.  Very disappointing.  I'm not sure what has changed besides the menu but this location needs to step up. One problem with chain restaurants is that when they have a good thing going they switch it up and go down hill, it's definitely a shame.  I also sent this review to corporate.",

My last visit sparked this review.    Weekday lunch at 12:30. Nobody in line but we waited at least 5 minutes before someone took our orders.  Pretty standard order of chicken kebab with roasted veg.  We sit down and after 10 mins one person in our party gets his salad. Another 10 mins go by before we see anyone else emerge from the kitchen. One of us asked when we might get our orders. The girl was very nice and went to check. She came back and asked what our orders are, despite us having an order number sitting on our table. We gave her all of our receipts and a couple mins later she told us our food would be right out. 10 mins later we got out food.   Chicken was dry, side was missing, whatever. 40 minute wait despite not being busy, bad food. Never coming back.",

Maybe other choices aren't so bad but here is a photo of my daughter's \"pizza.\" Like seriously, 2 little quesadilla triangles?! That plus a side (in our case chips) for $5!?!

It is a very no frills interior and you order up front, however the food is amazing and I was impressed with how delicious everything is. Also, the cookies in the front of the register are the best cookies made by a chain restaurant. Hands down, get a cookie. The steak kabob is way better than the chicken kabob.

And they both come with different dipping sauces that kick the favors up perfectly. My favorite side is the potato salad it's not mayo based and is made with small red potatoes.   Overall I never feel bad after eating here and the staff have always been very friendly and helpful. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",
