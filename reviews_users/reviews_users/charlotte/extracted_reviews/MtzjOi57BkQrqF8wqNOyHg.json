I brought my coworker there to get a plate and a slice a cake and it was like $20 lol. He wasn't thrilled. Their location caters to the corporate offices nearby but could still be a little more reasonable. Lawans which is 10 minutes away is substantially less. Overall go here and grab you a nice meal just bring a few extra bucks with you.",

The barbecued pulled chicken was on point and the highly praised yams were great as well. Warning: the yams are very sweet almost like a dessert.  Can't wait to visit again and try more options!",

We went with Nanas; good choice and not that Lawans is less by no means, but I must say for first time trying Nanas, it won't be my last.  Ordered the fried chicken, and several veggie plates.  The collards were my fav and I honestly would say it's some of the best I've ever had...amazingly good.  The same could be said for the green beans.  The mash potatoes were very good.  The cabbage was good but probably on par with others I've had, but still very good.  The banana pudding was good and definitely not jello based.  The sweet potato pie was awesome.  Highly recommend Nanas!!!",

I usually go for the fried chicken or fried fish with cabbage, collard greens or yams. All of the meals come with generous portions and a beverage. If you're undecided they will let you try out the sides before you purchase them. I would suggest this as I am not fond of the taste of all of the sides that they carry. Take a look at the menu before time and have an idea of what you want. The line can get long quickly and though the servers want to help you make a good decision, they also want to move you along as quickly as possible. They also have a good variety of desserts, consisting of sliced cakes & pies (all of which are delicious).",

    "text": "NaNa's is NumNum's  We first heard of this place from a radio ad and figured we would check it out as its out thought process that we should be able to find some of the BEST SOULFOOD in the South.  While NaNas was advertised as the superior SOULFOOD restaurant I would have to say it was Meh.. I personally have had much better and at a much better price. We have the best SOULFOOD restaurants in Chicago and I've had amazing in NYC. The theory is that most people migrate north from their southern states (Mississippi to Chicago, SC to NYC, etc.) which is why the soul food is so amazing. You would think that being in the South the SOULFOOD would be just as awesome from people from the South but that's not True.  Because I grew up with women making amazing SOULFOOD and I cook it amazingly so I'm a bit of a critic on how the food should be prepared and the overall taste.   The chicken my husband had was fried crispy which is good but the meat was a little on the dry side. Yes he had white meat which is a dry portion of the chicken however there are ways to make white meat moister in the preparation technique. The mac n cheese was okay (not the best) and the collards were a bit sweet. The bread pudding was pre made and there wasn't an option to have it fresh and HOT with ice cream (BUMMER).  It's a place to try but I'll stick to cooking out SOULFOOD unless I find the perfect place that I can use as a go to once in a while when I don't feel like cooking and want a great soulful meal.",

    "text": "I eat at Nana's often and the food is good. Today, I had the pulled barbecue chicken with collards and mac & cheese. It was tasty and the service has been fair to good for most of my visits.   However, today I was very disappointed. When I arrived with my family, I noticed that plastic table cloths were being placed on ALL of the tables.  I asked the server if they were having a special event, in which she replied, \"They [guests] are, we [Nana's] aren't!\"   I proceeded to ask if there would be anywhere for my family and I to sit. Another server chimed in and said \"Sure, outside.\" I was so agitated by the response that I almost left. But, since I had my grandmother with me, who had not eaten for hours, I opted to check the temperature outside. She wanted to stay.  Once I arrived outside, I noticed that the same party had reserved outdoor tables- by covering with plastic table cloths, with only a few available. I was confused. Then, on the way out after our meal, the large party that took over the establishment had the doors blocked- trying to place their INDIVIDUAL orders. We had to weave through a \"less than kind\" crowd to get out of the place.   As a business owner myself, I consider it HIGHLY unprofessional to allow a party to reserve all of your tables, while remaining open to the public. Considering the dining space is small and not sufficient for private reservations, Nana's should have closed. It not only lacks taste but it also indicates a lack of control over your business. If it were not mild weather, Nana's would have lost 4 customers. In fact, as a result of this experience, I doubt I will frequent as often as before, as I consider the business ethics to be in poor taste.",

Portions are large, wear sweatpants  Location: 3/5 Nana's is tucked away in a strip mall off of Tyvola. There's a good amount of corporate offices around it but if you don't work in the area, you've wouldn't know about this awesome restaurant. At least that's what I would think. The customer flow is pretty consistent though so news good cuisine must travel far.  Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3.5/5 I've honestly never dined-in. I usually grab it on the way home or on Sunday when I'm looking for a home cooked meal. The facilities are clean and reminiscent of a fast food place so don't bring a date here with the expectations of candle lights and nice silverware. I opt for take-out also because this grub will give you the \"itis\"  aka a food coma if you eat enough. Good luck with that self control too if you think you can stop.  Cleanliness: 4/5 See above.  Service: 5/5 The servers are nice and welcoming. They're not shy with their portions either. You won't have that \"Chipotle\" look of disdain on your face. You know that look! The look you get when the guy at Chipotle gives you a third of a scoop of protein.   Food: 5/5 It's so effin' good. If I'm every missing home or my mommy, I go to NaNa's ... then I drift into a slow, quiet sleep. Then i wake up and help myself to a second helping. Don't judge me. Everything is full of flavor so yeah ... that self control. My go to is the large plate: ribs, baked chicken, double Mac & Cheese. Nom. Nom. Nom.",

They tasted like a ham hock gave up its life to make that dish possible.   I was thinking that the barbecue ribs would be bone in ribs but they're not.   Also, I was thinking that the barbecue sauce might've been a bit watered down or 'thin'.   Despite these minor things, I would recommend checking out these authentic 'Down South' Flavors.

For the main dish, they have fried chicken, grilled chicken, BBQ chicken, curry chicken, pork chops, ribs, fried fish, etc... For the sides, they have mac & cheese, collard greens, green beans, baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad, candied yams and so on.  You know, southern soul food.  The combos are the 1 meat and 2 veggies or 2 meats and 2 veggies (veggies meaning sides).  The combo comes with a drink and the choice of corn bread or a dinner roll.  I went for the 2 meats and chose curry chicken and fried chicken with a side of candied yams, macaroni and cheese, and corn bread.  Wow.  The curry chicken was melt of the bone delicious.  The fried chicken was finger licking good, and the mac and cheese....the mac and cheese was AWESOME.    The candied yams were good too, but a little too sweet for me.  The rest of the dinner stole the show, though.  And I was too full to even eat the corn bread.    My only regret is that I didn't (or couldn't) order dessert.  They probably had 12 kinds of cake and I wanted to order all of them.  Some of my coworkers ordered the red velvet cheesecake and they loved it.  I'm definitely getting some the next time I go.  5 stars.  Even if you go just for the mac and cheese, this place is definitely worth it.",

We plan on making a trip back down there just to eat at Nana's. They also own the pizzeria in the same plaza and I plan on trying that as well.   The staff was excellent and the restaurant itself was tastefully decorated and had a comfortable feel. I can't wait to go back.  ^_^",

My husband had fried chicken and collards with his meal, and I tried both. The chicken was juicy and crispy, and the collards were perfectly cooked. And the cornbread--YUM!   Our meal was hot and delicious--real comfort food--and the service was fast and friendly. We ordered a to-go meal to take with us, and it was promptly prepared when we returned to the counter--no waiting.   Nana's will now be a staple on my visits to Charlotte.",

I'm talking multiple plates with piles of food. The fried chicken was awesome but the smothered chicken was to die for. The greens were well seasoned and the mac n cheese was creamy. What really sets Nana's apart from the other soul food places in the area is that the large plates come with (wait for it) TWO MEATS whereas at most places an upgrade usually gets you another side. Also, the meals include a drink. You definitely get your money's worth here folks.",

This place is situated in small plaza. We came here for lunch a couple of times and was always pleased with the food and the service!  Everyone was so nice and helpful.  On my two visits to Nana's I ordered the following items (Combination of my two visits of course!):  -Fried Chicken (So Crispy and Juicy, not dry) -Pork Chop (Tender and seasoned right) -Baked Beans (Delicious, but a bit sweet for my taste) -Collard Greens (Cooked to perfection) -Mac and Cheese (Cheesy Goodness) -Yams (Sweet but a bit oily) -Red Velvet Cake (Was a little on the dry side) -Banana Pudding (LOVED THIS!)  The portions they give you are pretty big, and their pricing is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I've been out to Charlotte twice now and made it a point to hit up Nana's on both trips. I will continue to hit up Nana's on my trips out to Charlotte going forward. To sum it up, good food delivered by good people.",

We both found the curried chicken to be outstanding though.  Great flavor, perfect medium heat a really nice entree, highly recommended !  The green beans were typical old style southern overcooked green beans that you would expect from soul food, but the nice thing about them is that neither they nor the collards were overly salted.  The employees were all really nice and that always matters.  Nothing fancy here as its cafeteria style so don't expect any old southern charm in ambiance or anything fancy, that was a little disappointing.",

I thought I'd found the best soul food in Charlotte some time ago, but I was wrong! Nana's takes soul food to another level! Now I'll be honest, when I walked in to this new strip building store front, saw a pretty large dining room that was nicely done, I thought it was going to be pretty tasteless in southern comfort food circles! The Fried Chicken alone would have brought me back time and again! Crispy batter with excellent flavors, and a juicy interior that had me speechless! The Mac n Cheese was some of the richest and creamiest I've had without being runny! The green beans were superb with bits of onions and a definite taste of bacon, fatback, or some kind of secret southern goodness! The Smothered Pork Chop, which normally I could care less about, was soaked in a brown gravy after being fried to a golden brown! Left simmering in a brown gravy for hours and yet still tender! You won't find this type of southern soul food just anywhere. Normally you'd have to look for this out in the country on a Sunday afternoon! Deep below the Mason Dixon Line where cholesterol was believed to be some fancy motor oil developed by a wayward Yankee!",

We were welcomed in and we were studying the huge menu options when a young man said\" just step up here and I'll explain everything to you\" and he even offered us samples.  I had baked chicken and catfish w greens and mac n cheese.  The greens were excellent.  Not bitter at all.  The mac n cheese was so yummy.  My hubs had the fried chicken n ribs- excellent.

Don't even dare ask for no gravy on those mashed potatoes, you're not a child anymore! Man up to those collards, they'll put hair on your chest, back and elsewhere.

During my 6 days in Charlotte, I ate here twice! I had the one meat combo which came with two sides and your choice of cornbread or dinner roll, and a drink. Also for approx $10. Pretty reasonable, I thought. Both times I had the curry chicken which was fall off the bone tender and flavorful and mac n cheese (good) as one of the sides. For the second side, the first time I had the steamed cabbage (bland) and second time, had the rice (spicy but good). Corn bread was okay. I also had the red velvet cheesecake and other time had chocolate cake. Yes, I was definitely indulging on this work trip!  For what can be a sleepy business park location during dinner time, this place was always busy. Employees were very friendly and that chicken was sooooooo good. If I ever return to that area, I have to make a pit stop at Nana's.",

The Young Man who served me showed me everything and was very quick with words and actions (it is like a cafeteria line - you walk through and you can see the food before you order)...  Collard Greens these were EXCELLENT!  5 yelp stars  Corn Bread (better than La Wan's. Not as good as Mert's) 3.65 stars  Mac and Cheese 3 stars good though not any better than just good.  Plenty of Meats to choose from, though I chose none, the Fried Chicken was the only one that looked good... Do I really Like Soul Food?  I LOVE Mert's, though am I expecting something Gourmet from a Restaurant that is not pretending to be... The Collards were plenty Flavorful, this place may be more Authentic than I am used too.  Three TV screens (and one playing the X Games [YES!!!])The whole set up is comfortable, the ordering line is blocked from the dinning area so you have a more peaceful meal than if you had to listen to someone like me who could have held up the line (if anyone were behind me) saying \"give me one of those Cookies\" the server says \"ah, sir that is a Chicken Fried Steak\"... They treated me as if they knew I was reviewing them... They did their BEST!!!  Service Team seems well trained on Politeness and Speed!!!",

The jerk chicken, which is the Friday special is served with great seasoning and just the right amount of heat! They have a variety of entrees to select from if that's not your thing from healthy baked chicken to smothered fried pork chops. You get to select two sides which again is difficult to choose from with the variety they have to sect from, my favorites are Mac n cheese, and yams, but the have tender greens with a slight bite, cabbage, black eyed peas and more.  If that is not enough you can end with a delightful homemade dessert for s few more bucks, my fave is the peach cobbler! Located near the CLT airport and some nice airport hotels, this is a go to spot to have a taste of home away from home!",

The chicken was a little dry, but the coating more than made up for it. The pork chop shined. It was so good, it was almost decedent.

Ok so a lot of the food is precooked which I usually don't love but it was still hot so that's the plus. I had the fried fish which was good very well seasoned and they fried it when I ordered it. The yams and fish were the highlight of my order. The Mac and cheese was too dry for me.   My friend had some curry chicken I think and fried chicken he didnt love his food.  He enjoyed the yams and didn't like the Mac either. We ordered dessert to go sweet potato pie for him and cheesecake sweet potato pie for me.

Honestly, I wish I'd known this before hauling my party of 5 in for dinner. (Especially when it was a toss-up between Nana's & Mert's.)   First, the good news. Upon arrival, the restaurant was clean, the chicken (baked and fried) was PHENOMENAL, and the staff was kind and helpful.   Other than that, I'm scratching my head as the rest was a burst of mediocrity. Although the 5 small plates we ordered all tasted fair, the goldish-green colored cabbage was a conundrum. The refrigerated dessert case was a huge disappointment also. We bought slices of strawberry and chocolate cake, and neither piece was the least bit moist and tasted store bought. I also wish you could see the food offerings displayed through the lids on the serving line. (I like to see what I'm buying, just saying!)  Nana's is not my favorite, but I didn't leaving hating my life. Just disappointed.",

We walked in not knowing what to expect, but it was clean, well organized and piping hot  :-)  There were plenty of choices for everyone's tastes.  The meats were fresh and well seasoned, the veggies were like your grandma had just put them on the table and the sweet cornbread didn't even need butter.  The sweet tea tasted just like my sweet tea at home in my refrigerator and it was self serve, so we never ran out  :-)  We were in & out and back to work within an hour...

Great reception. BBQ chicken was the main meat, twice. Sauce is very mild but tasty. We choose Mac n cheese, baked beans, and the collard greens.  All of which are so mouth watering good, I can't even describe.  The collard greens are, dare I say, better than mom's.  The cornbread was a little dry, the tea, sweet.

Now, to be fair, it may just be a difference in receipes but the collards were more sweet than saturated in vinegar (never heard of sweet collards before and never wish to again), the roll was warm and soft, and the macaroni...oh the macaroni; There's no other word for it..... GAR-BAhGE (please say it how it is spelled). I cannot put my finger on it but it just was not right man, it wasn't right. I'm no a big rib fan so this was probably my fault but I didn't particularly care for the ribs either. As ribs typically seem to be, they lacked a good amount of meat and were a bit on the dry side. The two stars are for the baked chicken which wasn't bad. My boyfriend had the curry chicken and ate a good amount of it so I can assume that it was decent but seeing as how he did not rant and rave as he usually does when something is spectacular, I would assume it was sufficient and that's about it. The location isn't bad, they have a nice area where you can sit outside and enjoy the day but I will not be returning to this establishment. In my opinion, Sunset Soul Food over on Beatties Ford Road is MUCH better (get the collards!).",

I seriously have never seen such large portions in my life! I got the bourbon chicken and fried chicken with black eyed peas and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is some of the best I have ever had! Boyfriend got the curry chicken and ribs with potato salad and greens. I don't eat greens but he said they were amazing.

I choose the greens and the mac and cheese as my sides. I love the mac and cheese, it's creamy, gooey and leaves you wanting more..how dare they :)  The second time in I snagged up the fried chicken and stuck with the same sides. I'm not sure if I'll get this again (I think I was playing it safe) but it was good.  Corn bread is on and off, sometimes its very moist - others it may be a tad dry.   As for the dessert, I've only seen people order it but I'm dying to try the Red Velvet Cake, guess I'll have to come in again!",

The service was awesome, the food was awesome and with a little twist of Jamaican it was the perfect storm of greatness! They have different sizes of plates you can depending on how hungry you are. You can eat in and enjoy the many tvs they have or you can take out and enjoy your food at home or wherever your going. I got the small plate and that was smothered pork chops with a drink and a piece of strawberry cheesecake. Yes they also have deserts and they are awesome too! Now if I had to give any criticism, it would be the prices. I got the smothered pork chop, two sides and a drink which is considered THE SMALL PLATE and an piece of cheesecake. The cost was $18.38. This may be ok for some and average for the area but in my own opinion I thought it was a little pricey. Overall a good experience and would definitely go back because I'm greedy! Hope this was helpful eat some for me!!",

I can  unequivocally say I have had better; and not just from my Mommy's kitchen. I got the small plate which came with two meats and two sides. I chose the baked chicken and my two sides were white rice and cabbage. I also paid extra for the macaroni (who gets soul food with no Mac and cheese?) The cabbage was seasoned and cut very well; no huge chunks of hard cabbage, very tender. The chicken could use a little less seasoning salt, but it was palatable; I put some Texas Pete on it and it was perfection! The rice was also well made, but it's hard to mess up white rice (in my opinion). I also got the macaroni and it was HORRIBLE! I couldn't eat more than two bites. I can't really describe it; it was just a cheesy thick mess. I'm looking at it now with a scowl on my face. I also got a piece of cornbread that was included in my meal. I'm used cornbread having a golden outside; very light; this one was very dense and pale in color.   I was very underwhelmed with the food, but the reason I gave my review 3 stars is because the service was excellent.",

Saw some reviews of Nana's, and went there eagerly anticipating bourbon chicken, meatloaf, and some sides.  I review the menu on the wall, and there are my choices.  Ok.  \"Bourbon chicken please.\"  \"Oh sorry, that's only available Tuesday.\"  Hmmm.  Ok.  \"Meatloaf please.\"  \"Yeah, that's available on Monday.\"  Grrrrr.  Ok.  \"Jerk chicken?\"  \"Wednesday.\"  Oh come on!  I'm on a low carb, high protein diet, so some of the other items were just not allowed on my diet, such as chicken alfredo, fried chicken, etc.  So I ordered baked chicken.  Baked chicken.  The same baked chicken I make for myself 4 nights a week.  I also ordered catfish.  Sides.  Hmmm, lemme see.  \"Okra please.\"  \"We don't have okra.\"  This is a soul food place right?  Southern cooking?  No fried okra?  I mean, really?  So I grabbed a couple random sides and sat down.  Chicken was juicy and delicious.  Sides were cucumbers and tomato (very spicy for some reason) and black eyed peas.  Good.  The catfish was inedible - I started digging into the VERY HARD, VERY THICK batter to find some actual catfish meat, and found little.  The breading was so tough, so thick, that it was like chewing on sandpaper.  I just gave up.  Very disappointed.",

I got the large plate which comes with 2 sides and 2 meats, I ordered the fried chicken and BBQ ribs with Mac and cheese and macaroni salad. I have high expectations when it comes to soul food. So I probably wouldn't have considered this place if I knew all the food was already prepared and displayed in a glass case and just kept warm or warmed up when ordered. I didn't really care for the ribs. They were a bit fatty and overcooked, which tends to make the meat dry. The macaroni salad had way too much relish or something, and I wasn't able to get past that taste. The mac and cheese was just 'ok'. Not a traditional baked Mac and cheese more of a KFC side of Mac and cheese. The fried chicken was pretty good. The flavors were spot on but it lacked the crunchy skin since it wasn't fresh. Because the service was so great, I wouldn't mind going back.",

I told my husband we must try when I saw the yelp reviews.  We ordered the fried cat fish. They make it fresh when you order. It took a really long time to cook but beyond worth it. Very flavorful. We also ordered the fried chicken. It was really good too. For the sides we had the yams, Mac and cheese, collard greens, and corn bread. All were finger licking good. My kids ate with us. They loved mac and cheese and yams as well.  I'm kind of sad I don't live here but glad too. I guarantee you I would be fat if I lived in charlotte. I would eat here everyday.

I called back and spoke to the manager and I was given a free side if I came back. I stopped after work today to pick it up and the server barely put anything in the container. This is the last time I will go there, mainly because the manager knew where I drove from and all you can do is give me a free side, that I may as well have not came back to get. In the future please consider those who keep you in business. You all messed up my meal plus inconvenienced me and you couldn't compensate with a full meal to replace the one that you all messed up. I burned gas twice coming there. I will not return again, I will go where I know the food will taste the same every time I go. I will stick to Lawan's...the best soul food in Charlotte. I hate to give this review but that was not handled properly. Any other business would have replaced the entire meal due to the inconvenience alone. When you know better, you do better!",

Order then came out to over $16 which I thought was ridiculous. I could have gone to Bojangles or KFC and fed my whole family of three for that price. Everything was good. Greens were too salty. Food is great but the price is too much if you want to add extra sides.",

    "text": "I decided to go here for lunch with a coworker yesterday (we have an hour for lunch and work 5 minutes away). I ordered the Catfish with two sides (mac & cheese and collard greens) with cornbread. The catfish is cooked when you order so I was told my food would be brought out to me. After waiting 15-20 minutes I ask about my order and was told the chef forgot to drop the catfish. I am told that I can have a free dessert and it would be brought out to me. I ask for a to go box because I figure at this point I will not be able to eat here and get back to work on time. I then get my food and instead of collard greens I have cabbage. I go to the counter to tell them of the mistake and the older woman that works out front proceeded to tell me that my ticket did not say collard greens and was so rude about my simple request which was to be given what I ordered and paid for. So I left with a to go box of catfish, collard greens, and mac & cheese. In addition I had cabbage and a desert (neither of which I wanted). And then to top it off, I realized after leaving that I never got my cornbread. All I can say is it will be a long time and I will have to have a desperate craving for soul food before I go back. The only reason they get two stars instead of one is because the food is sooooo good. Nana's you need to step up your customer service.",

I am probably one of the few who like the green leaves from the cabbage.  Personally I like bell peppers and lemon pepper seasoning in my cabbage so this would be a no for me.

I stopped in 3/2/11 after a long day at work.  The food is setup on steam tables, some of which looked like it had been there for since lunch time.  There is an option for a small or large plate where you pick your meat and 2 sides and includes a drink.  I choose the whiting, yams and collards.  There is a cooler full of desserts, bananna pudding was out so I got te peach cobbler.  I drove home inhaling the aroma ready to sample my meal.  The fish was alright but could have been seasoned a bit more for my taste, but given that everyone has different tastes, a hittle hot sauce did the trick.  The yams were delicious even though they were a bit sweeter than I am would prepare,  the collards were on the money.  My one mistake was not putting the peach cobbler in the microwave for a minute, since I really don't care for it cold.  However, it was flavorable with the right amount of crust,  I prefer a little sugar on my crust or that it be baked a little harder.  The only thing missing though was a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Fora newly opened resturant there will naturally be some growing pains.   Nana's is on my yes list.  It will be great to watch them grown.",

I have tried the fried chicken, ribs, and fish and the chicken was pretty good but the ribs were covered in fat and the fish was greasy. Their side dishes are just disgusting. The mac and cheese had a soupy/watery consistency, not at all like \"home cooked' but more like easy mac or something. The mac and cheese was running into the other compartments in my take out container. The cabbage was tasteless and also sitting in a river of water in the container. They should really think about draining that excess liquid from their collards and cabbage because it doesn't taste good and it makes a mess of the food when the liquid slips into all of the other compartments in the container. My cornbread was ice cold like they had just pulled it out of the fridge. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for real \"southern comfort food\". If you're a fan of KFC or Bojangles then you will probably like this place.  I actually visited a place called \"la'wans\"  on S. Tryon street near my house and their food is much better than Nana's. I had fried chicken, mac and cheese, and potato salad from La'wans and it was the best  soul food that i've had in Charlotte so far. Their mac and cheese was DELICIOUS and exactly what I was looking for. I would recommend trying their food atleast once. You will not be disappointed!!!",

The only descent thing we ordered was the fried chicken however the white only comes with a breast.

We ordered rib plates for both of us and two sides. Service was friendly and fast which was great. Ribs were falling off the bone tender and we enjoyed our dinner very much. My husband really enjoyed it but I personally was a little disappointed with our sides. We had the macaroni and cheese which in my opinion was bland and processed tasting. Mashed potatoes were ok, definitely needed more butter and salt. I ordered a cornbread but that was missing from our order.  My husband also got macaroni salad which was very good. I would definitely order again and switch it up if we lived local. Thankfully they made our stay here much better!",

They have a cooler packed with desserts from Oreo cake, yellow, strawberry filled, etc. i didn't get a chance to try these tasty treats but they looked good. it's a cafeteria style place which is easy to accommodate.

    "text": "Gee whiz. This place is worth the hype. I am in from out of town and wanted aome genuine Southern soul food. I ordered a small dinner ($10.99) and a slice of cake (4.99). I got 3 fried wings, mac n cheese and collard greens, with a corn muffin and drink. The wings were good. They had a slight over smell of grease, but it did not interfere with the taste. I like my chicken fried hard, and they did not disappoint. The mac and cheese was a small portion ( good for us watching our carb intake) and I am still trying to decide what kind of cheese was used. It was extremely smooth like Velveeta. Lord please say it wasnt. The star of the show were the collards! Cooked thorough, seasoned with a hint of sweetness. I never had sweet greens. Not overpowering, just slight. Delicious! The cake is tasty, moist and just the right amount of icing. I hate thick icing. I think the cake was a box mix. Im not sure. But I am sure that $5 was too much for it. Knock it down to $3.50.  You get a cup to select your own drink from the fountain. I combined ice tea and lemonade. The staff is very friendly, and the place is spacious to accomodate a large group comfortably. I highly recommend this place..",

It's all good - Salt'n pepper Cat Fish, Fried Chicken, Collard Greens, Sweet Potatoes, Banana Pudding, sweet tea... Sort of \"fast casual\" environment. But if you order Cat Fish, you'll have to wait while they fry it up fresh for'ya. It's sort of in the hood but I never felt unsafe. So if you a soul-food lover visiting Charlotte, you owe it to yourself to give Nana's a try.",

I had the Bourbon Chicken once and while it tasted very good, it seemed too bony, or not enough meat in the dish. I felt a little cheated on that plate. As far as sides, the pinto beans, curry rice, yams, and collard greens are always good. The dressing/stuffing is hit or miss so I don't order it anymore.",

Her fried chicken and pork chops were spot on. The ribs had too much fat on them. The pulled chicken was just ok. The collards the first day were good although they a lot of stems in the greens. The cabbage and greens  on my next delivery were lacking seasoning. The yams on my first delivery was seasoned with cinnamon.....I am used to both cinnamon and nutmeg. The sweet potato pie's crust was not done on the bottom and was under seasoned. The peach cobbler did not resemble any that I have eaten and had a horrible taste. The potato salad was swimming in a loose, liquidly mayonnaise which had some potatoes that where not done. The corn muffins are good. On the whole I will go back but be selective about what I order. Mac and cheese was too gooey.",

    "text": "I frequent Nana's quite often for lunch due to my job location. The food is great, no argument there, but in my opinion the price point is too high for the meal served. I'm originally from Alabama where 'meat and three' joints (1 meat, 3 sides) are as abundant as most chain restaurants and a good lunch may run $8-9. However a similar meal at Nana's, or in this case a 'meat and 2' will run you $11.  I'm not sure if this inflation is due to the restaurant being close to the airport or simply nestled among an up scale business district that drives the price. Whatever the case, pushing over the $10 mark for lunch is too much. In addition, adding another meat will run you $16. I guarantee that if there was a lunch special vs one flat rate regardless of meal then you would see an increase in foot traffic. Just my opinion.   Bottom line: Good food, high cost",

I looked online and saw Nanas was across my hotel. I called and was so relieved they were open. I walked over and when I walked in I was immediately greeted and a female asked if I have ever been there before. I said no and she took the time to explain the menu and the choices of sides. I ordered a large plate (2meats and 2 sides with cornbread) plus two extra sides bc I couldn't choose. I chose BBQ chicken, curry chicken, greens, Mac and cheese, yams and stuffing. I got cornbread and a drink included. I also saw desserts and again she was so nice to list to me what they had: I settled on red velvet cheesecake. I've tasted everything here so far and I feel like a grandma found me, made me dinner and fed me. This stuff is SOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! I'm in love with everything. These greens are LIFE and the yams and Mac and cheese are glorious. I wish they had a place like this in Miami where I'm from. Omg.....do yourself a favor and go here! Sweet tea taste homemade and yummy. I might faint from joy once I get to dessert.",

The fried chicken was dry, the BBQ chicken had the basic grocery store sauce, the greens were sweet, the cabbage was bland without any seasoning, and the yams were out of a can and too sweet. The cake seemed to be store bought. Cooking soul food takes heart and skill. I will not be back.",

Being new to Charlotte, coming from Chicago, I had some higher expectations. I had the jerk wings, black eyed peas, sweet potatoes and banana pudding. My guy had the baked chicken, stuffing (not dressing), black eyed peas and potato salad.  The majority of the food tasted canned, frozen or not from scratch. The jerk wings were more barbecued covering than jerk spice, but so-so. The black eyed peas were ok and the sweet potatoes were decent. The stuffing was just that. The potato salad was downright awful. The banana pudding tasted a bit like a gooey boxed pudding mix.  I would not return again.",

I'd been to Nana's before and just casually offered it up as a suggestion, as soon as my friends heard \"soul food\"....they practically knocked me over to get to the car.   When we arrived the place was packed! This was a great sign! My friends and I had plenty of time to look at the menu and see what we wanted....not to mention this place smells amazing as soon as you walk in the door.  I went with the smothered pork chops, cabbage and pinto beans and rice. My mouth is still watering from how good this meal was....the chop was so tender and the gravy has such great flavor, the cabbage has just the right about of crisp in each bite and the rice and beans were classic.   YUM!!!   Needless to say, I know exactly where I'll be going when I'm craving an excellent, finger licking, sleep is bound to take over my body soul food meal!",

    "text": "Being in residence across the street on a Sunday, this was an obvious choice since it's pretty much the only walkable restaurant open. What I didn't realize was that it was just as well that I didn't leave visiting Nana's to chance because I sure would have missed out on a treat had I not eaten there.   Typical Southern/Soul Food served within. Hearty servings and a friendly staff make this place a must visit. Not everything on the menu that I tried was a win however. Here's a road guide through my dinner.  + Smothered Pork Chops were delish. Very tender and slathered with some lightly salted gravy. Perfect ratio of meat to fat, with a little bone in there too. Exactly the way you would want it. You must order this.  + Candied yams smell like Christmas. More to the point, these are not canned, but rather homemade with a good helping of brown sugar that has them swimming in deliciousness. Not too sweet, and you still get that natural yam taste. Must order.  + I'm a recent mac and cheese convert, and this is very good standard homestyle mac and cheese.   + Standard banana pudding made from instant pudding with fresh bananas and Vanilla Wafers. This is a never fail formula and I like it. I learned tonight that homemade baked banana pudding is even better.....I'm intrigued.  -- RIbs were a bit of a miss during my visit. Not very warm and the meat wasn't very soft. Sauce was fine, but perhaps my expectations were too high? The way I like my ribs are falling off the bone. If you have to use a knife, they aren't tender enough. If you like your ribs the way I do, you may not enjoy these.   -- Rice was dry and firm. While pasta can be served al dente, rice should not be. Turned out that the chef had overcooked the rice, so that explains it. Sean, the owner, expressed concern and got to the bottom of that.  -- Corn Bread was not moist in the center, but rather a little dry. I also like mine a little toasted, but perhaps I'm a corn bread snob?  Overall, the cleanliness of the restaurant, TVs in the dining area, friendly staff, and Sunday hours, contribute a lot to the appeal. The owner, Sean, made the rounds and spoke to each customer in the dining area to check on their meals, and he means it. I mentioned the rice being firm and my friend didn't like the ribs.....done. We got an extra serving of the Smothered Pork Chops and Candied Yams. This is how business is done right. You listen to the customers and make sure nobody leaves your restaurant unsatisfied. Well done Sean, we enjoyed our food and appreciated your coming by to check on us.   Also, congrats on your upcoming first year anniversary of being open and being voted at #1 Soul Food in Charlotte! Don't let it go to your head, you've got hungry mouths to feed that now have expectations ;-)",

I made the mistake of trying the collard greens first.  I swear it felt like angels dancing on my tongue!  I've never had better and swear I felt a tear welling up in my eye.  I thought it would be all downhill from there.  Nope!  The fried chicken was crispy, juicy and perfectly seasoned.  The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious.  The roll was not homemade and tasted like every other roll you've ever had - which made me wonder why serve them at all.  It's like hanging an air freshener in a new Ferrari.  Nonetheless, it all ended with the homemade sweet potato pie.  Mouthwatering!",

    "text": "First time at Nana's today, and I was excited to try a new soul food restaurant with my grandmother. It was relatively slow for a Sunday in my opinion, with maybe 5/6 other parties in the restaurant. I ordered a small dinner meal with catfish and two sides. Considering it's fish, I guess their policy is to cook it per order so that it's fresh. Very reasonable, I had no problem with that. HOWEVER, 20+ minutes later with no other patrons in line ordering food, and even one of their employees kept asking where was my food, I decided enough was enough. It definitely doesn't take over 20 minutes to fry two pieces of fish, max 5-10 mins. I went to the register and asked the woman who took my order how long it would be, and her exact response was, \"shaking her head and shrugging her shoulders\", as in I don't know. I instantly asked for a refund. Two employees apologized for my poor experience, which was nice, however no manager approached me to offer me any other options, or a compensated side or diff protein for my very patient wait. PLUS, a customer who came after me and ordered fish had gotten their food and left. My grandmother was finished with her food by the time I even asked for a refund. Funny thing is, I was going to order 3 extra meals for family members who couldn't make it out, but I immediately decided against that after my experience. Long story short, I won't be dining here again, and it's unfortunate because I try my hardest to support Black businesses. Don't order fish if you go here, and don't expect great customer service!",

Generally I'll check out what fellow yelpers have to say before I pop in somewhere, but I was starving and short on time. So, flying blind, I popped into Nana's for a late lunch.   A few people were in there eating but no line and no crowd. Order on the left with the pleasant staff manning the delicious heaps of food, and after you've got your meal you head to your seating area. I ended up getting the small lunch plate with fried chicken, collards and black eyed peas. Of course with some cornbread on the side. The chicken was crisp and flavorful on the outside, and perfectly juicy on the inside. Tons of flavor and meatiness in the collards, and the black eyed peas were cooked well too. Big fan. They asked when I checked out if I wanted to get dessert...I now regret saying no!  Since I have no idea when the next time I'll be in Charlotte is, please go eat here for me. And don't skip dessert.",

Although I'm from the Boston area, I'm a big fan of southern food (although my experience with True southern soul food is probably limited).  What I do know is that for fast food, this food was awesome.  The business model essentially presents the customers with a wide variety of prepared main dishes and sides.  The main dish offerings included Chicken (fried, backed, bbq, jerk, curry, bourbon), Ribs, smothered pork chop, fried catfish, meatloaf, others.  Sides include Black Eyed Peas, Cabbage, Cole Slaw, Collard Greens, Cucumber Salad, Curry Chicken Rice, Fried Okra, Green beans, Lima Beans, Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes, Pinto Beans, Potato Salad, Stuffing, White Rice, Yams, and others.    You can get a small or large dish.  Small is 1 meat, large is 2.  I got a large plate with Fried Chicken and Smothered Pork Chop.  For sides I got cabbage and black eyed peas.  My son got BBQed ribs with Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens.  Everything was truly excellent.  I was most surprised by the pork chop, which was moist and flavorful.  I love good fried chicken, and this was pretty good.  The Collard Greens and Black Eyed Peas were amazing also.  Not only would I go back, but we actually did the next night for some take out dinner after the football game.  I'm sure there are other great soul food place out there, but for quick sit in or take out, I don't think you can do better.",

I ordered the large plate, then you get two proteins and two sides. I had the smothered pork chop, fried catfish, mac & cheese, sweet potatoes, corn bread muffin and for dessert, banana pudding. Everything was good EXCEPT the fried catfish. It had decent flavor but it was kinda limp and greasy. So I would've rather tried a different protein but everything else was excellent. The banana pudding was real banana pudding, and NOT that fake instant pudding crap. I truly enjoyed and will definitely be back again. The establishment was clean and the staff was nice, PLUS the portions were plenty. I would definitely recommend this place to others.",

You also can choose between corn bread or roll and if you choose roll your drink is for free. I was impressed with the number of sides and meat they had, besides the special of the day. I had ribs with green beans and curried chicken rice and my husband had smothered chicken with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes with gravy. The food was AMAZING!  I tried my husband's mashed potatoes and I fell in love!  My food was great too, the green beans were my favorite. Nana's definitely will be on my list of restaurants to go back.",

One might dare to call them \"G-d's OTHER Chosen People.\"  It's a rare thing when photos can not show nor can words even remotely describe the pure awesomeness and splendor of food.   Such is the case with the food at Nana's.   Rounding off a week-long trip through the south, the dinner meal I just slowly enjoyed here at Nana's was the perfect capstone to a week of fantastic southern meals. Really, the culinary experience of this trip could NOT have ended on a better note.   I got a large - fried chicken (2 thighs) and a rib. Sides were yams and curry rice. The meal included a cornbread, butter, and a drink (sweet/un 50/50 w ice)  The fried chicken might be the the best I've ever had. The rib was almost equally mind blowing.  I don't want to know how much sugar is in the syrupy water from which the yams were removed before they were ladled onto my plate.... don't ever tell me. The curried rice balanced spice and flavor perfectly. In short - eating at Nana's Soul Food Kitchen is a religious experience not to be taken lightly, but to be thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated.   Next time I'm in Charlotte - Nana's will be my first stop.",

Yet, everyday you can guarantee a hot bar full of great options such as black eyed peas, collard greens, mashed potatoes, yellow rice, dressing, and more. All prices include the drink. And when you check out, don't forget to check behind the counter for dessert options.  Pro Tip 1: ask for a sample if you aren't sure. They will give it to you.  Pro Tip 2: mix your sweet tea with the lemonade",

The ribs were really good too, but I can't stop thinking about the sides.   The price was a little more than I wanted to pay, but to get it hot and ready as soon as you step in, makes up for that. It also came with the drink, which is normally $2 most places you go to. I will be back and I'm ready to try all of their amazing looking items.",

The restaraunt is somewhat cafeteria style and their lead item is fried or grilled chicken.  They have other protein options and a host of comfort food sides.  I like that the time and effort is put in to the breadth of choices and not over doing the decor.  It's a smidge on the pricey side for a cafeteria style serving model, but the portions are generous in my opinion.  I also like that they have a wide variety desserts as well.  They also sport some local colas on the fountain heads.  Overall, a very good experience and a great find on this part of town.",

Originally the staff told me they were out of cornbread- I told him a regular roll was fine-but after I paid; he put some fresh cornbread in a box for me. Great customer service skills!  Awesome staff and the customers are nice too. Man, I miss the south. This place hit the spot for me!  **update** Went back for lunch the next day.  Just as phenomenal. This time I remembered to take photos and got dessert- after a customer recommended the banana pudding for my 1 year old.

Everything was just wonderful.Both of my kids are very picky and they actually ate every bit of their food and enjoyed it. That's how you know it's good. The red velvet cheesecake is to die for and the kids enjoyed their cake the nice man at the register offered to them which was the strawberry icing cake! Definitely will be back! Also loved how the place was so clean and how everyone was friendly and welcoming!",

They give huge portions and always left me enough to fly back home to my husband. My favorites were the mac n cheese and crispy fried chicken. Their banana pudding with Nilla wafers was always something I had to take home as well.

This is where I stopped being thrilled. The staff was polite. I ordered a small plate ( 1 meat and 2 sides). I opted for 2 fried chicken legs, Macaroni and Cheese, and Stuffing. The chicken was good but the sides were generic and lacked seasoning.  I also bought dessert....uhhhhh. The cheesecake was waxy and just not good. I really have to start baking again.

    "text": "We were staying at the nearby Doubletree so decided to walk over for dinner. It's cafeteria style where you order either a small plate (one meat, two sides, $12) or large plate (two meats, three sides, $18). Fountain drinks are included in the price of the plates. They also have a vegetarian plate and a kid's plate available for reduced prices. You just walk your tray down the line like at a cafeteria and point to what you want. We ordered fried catfish and was told that the fried fish are all cooked to order so we also ordered our sides, paid for our meals and they brought everything to our table when it was ready. That took about 10 extra minutes so not long at all.   Overall everything was really good. I had collards and Lima beans with my catfish. They were good but salty. I have to watch my sodium intake so I really can't be eating at Nana's regularly. But this was my first time there and really glad I tried it. Husband's black eye peas and cornbread dressing were also delicious (and salty). With the small plate, you get one big catfish filet deep fried with a seasoned flour and corn meal coating. It was cooked to order so we got it really hot just out of the vat. Really good and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. So yummy. Next time I might get a double order.   The grandkids loved their fried chicken and ribs but didn't like the Mac and cheese, which tasted like it had pretty sharp cheese.   Other than scaling back on their heavy hand with the salt, I still think this is a great place to get southern or soul food. There's also dessert but we were so full and the line had gotten pretty long that we decided to skip it. Sure, we'll come back, but it'll have to be long after I've flushed all this extra salt out of my system.",

Fried chicken was a weak point; dried out.   Expect lines. Came in and was only then second in line. By the time I walked out the line was 15 feet out the door.",

They were flavorful and covered with sauce.  They give you plenty of food and the wings are a pretty nice size. I got two sides, macaroni and cheese and yams. They were equally as good. Everyone in my group could not stop talking about their meals. They were all very satisfied.   You can either eat in the dining area which is huge and have TVs or you can eat on the patio overlooking the street. The staff there is friendly and they do offer desserts.  I could not try them though because I was full from my meal.   I recommend this place and look forward to going back there real soon.",

We walked in on a Friday, the special jerk chicken was finger lickin delicious. I swear, one of the best chicken recipes I have ever had. The mac and cheese was good, not the best, but still satisfying. The mashed potatoes were creamy. My brother ordered a side of fried okra but had to wait a while as it was being fried. It was a little under-seasoned but the hot sauce fixed that up.   I was tempted to try the desserts but alas, I did not have time.   We will be back.",

You know the one, the part, have you ever been to a friend's house to eat...the mac is all soggy :)  The only redeeming quality from my plate was the crispy, well marinated,  chicken breast.  My plate, shared with my daughter:  breast, ribs, greens, mac/cheese, bbq beans, and diet coke.  $20 plus.   The ribs seemed to be boiled then slathered with sauce.    The greens were sweet (is this a north carolina thing?)  The mac/cheese was soggy.  The beans were ok.  Everything was trashed except for the chicken and coke.   I wanted to like this place.

About two minutes later I receive a call back and it's the lady from NaNas and she says, \"I'm so sorry to be calling..just wanted to let you know that I went to double check and were actually out of banana pudding right now. I didn't want you to drive all this way just to find out we didn't have it\". So this may seem pretty simple, but it was a big deal to me. She didn't have to call back - she was so nice and personable. We still ate there of course lol. I was too stuffed for desert anyway. But really friendly people, gave food suggestions and samples.

I decided to get a preview of the food before I ordered so my husband and I drove 30 minutes to the restaurant.  I didn't see anything on the website saying that they don't serve the full menu everyday but  wasn't able to get Jerk Chicken because of this. We ordered four plates with a combination of  Sweet Chicken, Curry Chicken, BBQ Chicken and Smothered Chicken along with Cabbage, Mac n Cheese, Stuffing, Collard Greens, Mashed Potatoes and  Tomato/Cucumber Salad. I guess enjoyment of food is relative to what you're accustomed to because my family and I felt that the food was just ok. The best items to me were the cabbage and Sweet Tea. The greens had TOO much vinegar,  the mac-n-cheese had a mild taste of garlic, mashed potatoes were bland w/o gravy,  stuffing tasted like boxed stove top,  Stewed Chicken should fall off the bone; it didn't and could have been seasoned better, the BBQ chicken is oven baked with bbq sauce on top. My husband didn't care for the sweet potato pie either. Over all, this was not the experience that I expected.  Nana's obviously has happy customers and I wish them great success, it's just not for me.",

My mac and cheese taste like garlic and cheese wiz, my fish had no flavor whatsoever. Taste like it came out the box dipped in batter and fried. My greens tasted like it sat in a bowl of vinegar and my yams of course we're candied.  For 10.49 a pop I would at least like my fish to be well seasoned. I'm from Philly and majority our soul food spots season their food well and I'm shocked that I'm down south and this food taste like a northern just opened a new restaurant.  Don't get me wrong it wasn't nasty but it wasn't delicious either. It was ok! Try and do better. Change your chief. From the reviews everyone hates the Mac and cheese and I have to agree",

    "text": "The food here was absolutely delicious. The Platters are huge. My husband and I were in Charlotte for a short overnight business trip and we were looking for some good soul food. You know the kind that makes you think that somebody's Grandmama was in the back cooking. Nana's Soul Food Kitchen did not disappoint. As soon as we walked in and peruse the huge menu with every single side you could imagine we must have looked overwhelmed because they asked us if this was our first time and they would go over everything with us. So welcoming and so nice to deal with my indecisive husband about what he wanted. I was very impressed that the young woman serving behind the counter was able to name all 18 side items in a row. I told her she deserves an award for that. We were feeling extra greedy so we had a little bit of everything. We had the barbecue jerk Wings which was the special for the day macaroni and cheese collard greens potato salad smothered pork chop and catfish. Of course we weren't even able to put a dent in all that food but tasted everything and it was amazing. The desserts were pretty solid as well. As I sit here and write this review while my husband packs up our stuff to check out and head home we are seriously considering hopping over to Nana's as soon as they open to get some food to take home. Will definitely be visiting the spot the next time we come back to Charlotte.",

The candied yams are always super yummy too! Service is great and the employees are friendly.The only problem I have with this establishment is consistency. Sometimes the chicken is dry or the meatloaf doesn't taste the same. Every now and then the mac-n-cheese isnt so fabulous. Many of their food items are like this. This restaurant is touch and go when it comes to how well the food tastes. I wouldn't put Nana's at the top of my list but its definitely a decent place to stop by for a quick lunch.",

The decor was nice.  I had the smothered chicken which was delicious as were the candied yams.  The collard greens were cooked with too much vinegar which was not to my liking.  Otherwise, they were fine.  The cornbread was very dry.  My daughter and I shared a slice of coconut cake which was very heavy and way too sweet.  We're both big fans of coconut cake but not at Nana's.  They ran out of sweet tea which I always order in restaurants.  I really give Nana's 3.5 stars.  It was a little better than A-OK but I can't say that I'm a fan yet.  Not sure that we'll visit too often especially since it's out of our way.  But, it's a nice place to visit every once in awhile.",

The restaurant is spacious. It's clean. The menu selections are broad and the prices are comparable to the portions you get. They don't put pork in the collard greens and there is a lot to choose from if you are a vegan. My only concession with this place is they use cheap plastic plates when you dine in. For a business of this caliber, I would suggest using real plates and silverware. Not only is it conducive to the environment, it's simply more tasteful. They give you a lot of food and it was hilarious to see the line cook take extra time to ensure that the food wouldn't don't drop off of the plastic plate. Other than that, I was pleased. They have TV's for you to look at and they come around and check on you, which is cool.",

I was very satisfied to find out that Nana's Kitchen did not have pork in their vegetables, so that was a plus for me. The customer service was pleasing as well. The food was delicious.

The kitchen staff and the line staff were super helpful and friendly - they don't joke around when they say family owned and operated- there is a young girl there, maybe 11 working the front line and ROCKS it out! She is more accurate with her orders than most adult staff I know! Anyway back to the food...I had the fried chicken (awesome) black eyed peas (almost as good as mine) macaroni and cheese (waaay better than mine) and corn bread (amazing) husband had the fried Tilapia (very good) green beans (best in town) and something else that I don't remember...I don't remember because I was face deep into my fathers catfish! I promise you it was the best catfish I have ever had! Do your self a favor and make it a point to come in and have some food, but more importantly, have a conversation! Almost all of the staff and the owner came out to check on us and have a chat! Omg! Don't forget the banana pudding! I can't even tell you how good it was except to say I got one to go and it was so good I only let myself eat a little bit at a time so I could enjoy it for a few days!!!!!

I love supporting local small business and definitely think this place is worth supporting.  Way better then going to a chain restaurant.  Thank you Desire",

I purchased a baked chicken breast, mac & cheese, collard greens, and banana pudding....came w/ a cornbread muffin and a drink, so I got a bottle of water. The total was $16.32. In all fairness, the chicken was well cooked and tasted really good, but it was all down hill from there. The cornbread was decent but dry. The greens were barely cut up, had huge stems all in it, too sweet, and too salty at the same time. The mac & cheese looked and tasted like Kraft mac & cheese for the most part. The banana pudding wasn't homemade...tasted like it came from a box as well. I had high expectations for this place, but I was extremely disappointed! I grew up in the south and was taught to cook from scratch at a young age. This is not the place you want to go for that legit, \"grandma's soul food\" taste. I mean, you can go for the chicken...but at that price, I expected so much better than what I actually got! Smh...",

The food is set up cafeteria-style, and everything smells and looks so yummy. We both had the small plate, which consists of 1 meat, 2 sides, cornbread/roll, and a drink. I have been wanting to try their meatloaf, and when I tell you... it tastes like mom's meatloaf. I also had their mac-n-cheese which was so creamy, and their cucumber salad which was crisp and fresh. My friend had their fried chicken (which was piping hot and the skin was so crispy), along with yams and mac-n-cheese. The ladies behind the counter were friendly and cheery and engaging, and the dining area itself was clean and neat (with the exception of some water near the drink machines). My only complaint is that I ate too much, and couldn't take a nap afterwards! I will definitely be a lunch-time repeat customer!",

The cook said its in the oven I asked how long so I could wait. No answer. They put this undone Mac n cheese on my plate I am horrified. This is the worse Mac n cheese ever. I as a business owner would prefer you talk mess about me running out than to serve some undone food. Overall the rice was nasty the gravy bland. Baked chicken good yams were awesome stuffing good couldn't tell what type of BBQ I was eating asked for chicken and it was cut up in small pieces I'll pass. Desert red velvet cheesecake.

You walk to the counter and the food is presented in an assembly line, the staff plates your food you just let them know what you want, first you choose your meat then you move on down the line to complete your other choices such as the side item, corn bread/roll, dessert and then finally you pay for your food and grab your drink. The seating area is clean and spacious, they have outside seating as well and there are 2 or 3 TV's mounted on the walls. The food is good, seasoned well (not salty) and the price isn't bad especially for the large portions you receive. Staff was cool we didn't have any issues that I can think of the only thing that annoyed me was the single restroom. The restaurant isn't huge but in my opinion any dine-in restaurant should have a multiple use restroom, at lease 2 stalls especially for women and children. I will def come again and recommend it to visitors.",

When I mentioned that we was going back to Charlotte my boyfriends eyes lit up and he was supper excited to eat Nana's again Cafeteria style soul food. I've had the meatloaf.. It was Yummy. Their pork chops are to die for!! And you can't go wrong with their fried chicken!! My boyfriend love the smothered chicken breasts!! What's crazy is that for it to be cafeteria style the food still has the fresh out the oven taste and and supper tender! Mac and cheese is delicious!! Cabbage isn't mushy. The cornbread muffin is okay nothing to brag about.. It's actually on the dried side!! Yams are good too!! The potato salad was to salty.. Then again I'm very picky with potato salad. The service has always been great!! I would have to say they are a little pricey but the food is so worth it!!",

But boy was I glad that I got the opportunity to try some of the food!   I had the fried chicken breast and cornbread. Even reheated, the fried chicken was still moist, tender, and crispy. It was cooked well and still juicy. Not overcooked and dry like you find at a lot of other restaurants.   The cornbread was SO good! It was incredibly moist with just a hint of sweetness. Again, a big difference that the cornbread or corn muffins you find at other places that are dry and crumbly. I definitely look forward to being able to visit Nana's in person, to enjoy another excellent meal there.",

The best part of the food were the side dishes. *two stars*   - Fried chicken was very bland.  - Baked chicken was bland and looked under cooked once opened up.

It did not taste like home made southern Mac and cheese.

They do not offer meatloaf everyday, which is what I wanted-but it was not documented on the online menu or anywhere on their website.  SO I ended up with the vegetable plate.  The cabbage was absolutely awful.  Horrible sweet-ish soury taste. The mashed potatoes with gravy and the cornbread was good.  1 out of 2 staff members was friendly and helpful.  It was mostly a disappointment.",

The food looked so good, I went from nothing, to wanting to order a piece of fried chicken and then decided to order a full meal.  My favorites are the fried chicken and candied yams- on point!!!  The restaurant environment was clean and inviting and the service is consistently good as I've been back twice.  Prior to hearing about Nana's when ppl ask if there are any good soul food spots in Charlotte, I'd say no.  Now I can recommend, with confidence, Nana's Soul Food.  Good food, eye pleasing environment, good customer service!  All 3 are important and Nana's has it.",

I also loved the cabbage and the curry chicken! It all is well seasoned with an amazing flavor! The cornbread is sweet and i recommend this place to everyone who wants a home cooked meal! The only criticism i can offer is the staff could be a little nicer and smile . They make you never want to come back. And to be honest everytime i leave i say nope i am never coming back but i do because its the best food ive ever ate. However Augustine the cashier was wonderful and you could tell he loved his job! If this was based solely on the food hands down they get 1000!",

The mac looked like it was made from a box, not baked or anything, just saucy. I've had plenty of better soul food in Charlotte. This was my first and last time visiting Nana's.

They will microwave for you but they just nuke the whole styrofoam container instead of on a plate. Don't think microwaving studious a good idea for health reasons.  But, the food tastes good. On the expensive side, though.  Small daily special with a desert is $18. Pricey.",

    "text": "Once again you must realize in reviewing a restaurant that you are comparing it to the standard mark the concept is trying to hit. Initially, we were going to the nearby Jersey Mike's until we saw the sign for Nana's.  Great choice!  So, Nana's gets five stars for being a Soul Food Kitchen.  Initially, if you are going to call yourself a soul food kitchen, that means you and your staff must be cheerful, friendly and joy filled...and they were.  We were pleasantly greeted, asked if this was our first time visiting and given an explanation of their food offering and how it worked.  It is basically a cafeteria style serving with the food set out in a buffet that is tended to by the servers.  I could not pass up the fried chicken from a Soul Food Kitchen, but there were other meat choices such as pulled BBQ chicken, salisbury steak, ribs, etc.  The fried chicken did not disappoint - all dark meat for me, of course, but it was flavorful, crunchy, not overly breaded and also not greasy.  This is some of the best fried chicken I have had.  Sides were typical, mac and cheese, black eyed peas, lima beans (butter beans), etc.  But since it is a Soul Food Kitchen and since I love collard greens, I had to ask if they cook their collards with brown sugar (yuk) or not.  Instead of trying to describe the flavor, I was offered a sample tasting and these were without brown sugar and with a slight hint of spiciness.  They were tender but not cooked to mush, still having some leafy green integrity.  Next to the green beans - canned or homemade?, I asked.  \"Homemade.\"  I'll have that.  They tasted like my mother's green beans, which is very good, tender, savory, salty but not too much and not cooked with a bunch of grease.  They tasted fresh, not like the tinny canned taste I had feared.  The cornbread was accurately NOT SWEET and tasted just as cornbread should taste, not like a peice of cake.  This is the kind of food I grew up on and often cook myself.  They hit every single item out of the park.  So, Nana's isn't going to compare to Morton's or the Capital Grille, but it doesn't have to because that is not what they are...what they are is an outstanding family run Soul Food Kitchen that gets five stars for excellence at doing just that!!",

Was feeding a few people so I was able to try a bunch of their food items.  I tried the fried chicken, smothered pork chops, meat loaf, cabbage, lima beans, mac and cheese, and banana pudding. The fried chicken was very good. Actually wish I didnt have to share it bc I'd have preferred it to the other meats. If I came back I probably wouldn't get the smothered pork chops again. The meat loaf was pretty good  but not better than that fried chicken!!! The cabbage could've been cooked a little longer, in my opinion, but the other sides were very tasty!   A small meal comes with 1 meat, 2 sides, a drink, and a roll/corn bread for about $10-11. A large meal comes with 2 meats, 2 larger sides,  a roll/cornbread, and a drink for about $16-17. The employees were extremely friendly and helpful. If I'm ever in this area again, I would definitely return (I'd skip the banana pudding tho)!",

We arrived around 1:00pm in the afternoon and the restaurant was probably 40% filled.  I ordered the Fried Chicken small plate lunch, which entitled me to two pieces of fried chicken (leg and breast), two sides and choice of bread and drink.   I chose the mac and cheese and the green beans along with cornbread.  The chicken was juicy, but lacked something in the taste.  The mac and cheee was smooth and mild, but tasty.  The green beans were okay.  The cornbread was pretty dry though.  And hard.  The total for my meal came to eight bucks and change.  I will definitely consider coming back as they have a bunch of options for their \"meat and two\" and they begin serving breakfast 04/11/11.

The mac and cheese was just okay and the collards were a bit on the spicy side.  The corn bread a little dry.  This was not my first visit, as I work in the area.  I would give 5 stars if the food was good each time, but there is no consistency.  The service however is always great and the place is clean whenever I visit.",

I overheard another patron say, \"this is Sunday dinner cooking without all the work.\"  That's the best description for Nana's.  Yum!",

Being from Cali, good soul food is hard to come by, but North Carolina scratched my itch. Husband had the fried chicken, cabbage and yams. We shared our sides and everything was good. Would definitely recommend.",

    "text": "After many months of hearing reviews on Nana's, I finally decided to go since they are opening a new restaurant downtown near my job.  I wanted to see what I should expect if I would go there for my occasional need for soul food.  The restaurant situated in a small mall off the main street.  Cafeteria style service offerring good choices of meats and veggies.  I had to have the fried chicken.  It was simply so good.  the veggies...seasoned rice and green beans could use a little more seasoning.  I ordered cobbler for dessert that had to heated in the microwave.  I was expecting cobbler from a sizzling hot pan.  Ooops...did not happen.  I am looking forward to trying the new restaurant downtown Charlotte.  And hoping that the chicken be just as good as it was from the southern restaurant.",

A fair price for that plate should have been $7 tops.. I paid $10 an didnt get a drink with it.. Don't think I will be visiting this place anytime soon..",

The collards were pretty good as well, I live in the south and some people make them better than others.      It got bad after I got home from dinner though.  This place gave me gas from hell, so bad that it made my wife cry. I am not allowed to go back to this place.  Five stars for food, but I took two stars off for the gas factor.  :(",
