We ordered the pretzels as an appetizer, and we we were disappointed when the pizza came out first.  However, the salt & butter pretzels are delicious!  The server was very attentive & friendly.",

    "text": "Much better than the Selwyn location! Decoration is sweet and if you get a chance to sit at the touch table, your little ones will be occupied for the whole dinner. (Almost like a date night.)  Getting a table on a busy night can be a bit unorganized with the crowd and the faux hostess stand in the middle of the crowd. But once you're seated, it is worth the wait.   Pizza is phenomenal. The crust makes the pie. Umami, house special and mighty meaty are choices that you can't go wrong with.   The bonus is a nice beer selection. Nice local craft selection and some rare finds from time to time.   Mellow Mushroom is a family favorite.",

This particular night they had live music via an acoustic guitar player and that was a nice touch I thought.    The food here is just like the other locations.  Good and consistent.  I went with my favorite, the meatball app and I ended up doing one of their \"build your own\" salads.  It's refreshing to go to a place that actually has the option of building a salad with whatever you want.  Cool.  The beers here are always on rotation much like the other locations, specifically they keep a good stock of IPA's and local craft beers as well as some of the more rare porters, etc.    Parking isn't horrible but the area does get pretty jammed up so just be patient.",

When we went there, they served the food without giving plates or napkins; waited 10-15 minutes for someone to show up, who finally got the plates and by that time, food was cold. Quality of appetizers was good but the pizza had a week's worth of salt in them. Table size is also extremely small for the number of people they fit on them, there was no room even for the plates.!  Another caveat; if you are planning to sit outside in late evening, be prepared to deal with irritating small bugs hovering over the food!  Would likely not return.",

The atmosphere is nothing to scream about. It actually reminds me of undergrad where my neighbor across the dorm who used to dabble daily in \"Herbal\" remedies. Too Austin Powerish for my liking but to each their own. Now to the nitty gritty...the service is HORRIBLE! It takes an eternity to get food. I placed in an order an hour early and when it came time to pick it up...they said it would be an additional 20 min. What's the point of placing an order ahead of time if I'm still having to endure a significant wait time. Sounds backwards to me. I've only gone here due to necessity but I probably won't be back due to the service. They may want to hire additional staffing or figure out a methodical way to cut down their wait time.",

    "text": "Our visit to Mellow Mushroom on Saturday afternoon was truly a tale of two waiters.  We arrived around 2:30 for some drinks and maybe an appetizer or two with a friend. Our waiter showed up, and was sort of a tripping kind of 'dude' guy who used the word 'Word' way too often, but was funny, engaging, and on top of things. We ordered our first round of beers, which came out quickly.  Waiter Dude picked up on the fact that my husband likes craft beers, so shortly thereafter he came out with a sample he thought my husband would like. \"Dude, if you like the one you've ordered, you've got to try this one.\" So my husband did. He loved it, and that was ordered for the second round.  Waiter Dude came out with the second round of beers and a sample of another new craft beer for my husband to try. We chatted a bit and decided we'd place a few orders for apps: pretzels, hummus and the oven baked wings. Waiter Dude was awesome, and then he disappeared.  Like, literally, he disappeared. We didn't see him for another thirty minutes. We had to flag down a waitress and ask her about our food order and to please check on it. Three minutes later, our waiter was out with our food, all apologies about how it was held up by a huge pizza order or something like that. He brought no plates or napkins and said he'd be back with them.  And then he disappeared again. For nearly ten minutes. Finally our friend had to get up and go inside to ask for them, and he returned out again, quiet and with apologies, put them down and bailed.  My wings were refrigerator cold the instant they came out of the \"kitchen\" so I seriously doubt they had been held up by busily working on other things. I know this because I didn't bother to wait for the napkins to dig in, I was hungry.  The food really wasn't good, and the service went from quirky and fun to terrible in the blink of an eye. We were there mid-afternoon. It wasn't like there was a rush. I certainly didn't see any huge pizza orders leaving the restaurant, or any huge groups entering the restaurant, and we were outside right by the doors.  It takes effort to screw up a few rounds of beers and apps for 3 people, but Mellow Mushroom managed to. I really want to like this restaurant, but I have never had a reliably good experience there and the food isn't great either. I don't know how they stay in business.",

    "text": "The last time I had Mellow Mushroom was when their Highland Creek location was still open.  The one on Selwyn is not convenient, so I was happy to hear a while ago that they would be opening in Ballantyne Village.  Most restauranteurs definitely get the demographics of Ballantyne wrong.  It's not the rich old people of South Park.  Restaurants like Table and Solara have closed while Moe's is always busy.  Ballantyne is a suburb within the city, complete with soccer moms and kids.  They want a place to take their kids, and MM fits the bill, as shown by most of its clientele.  Like a recent article I read about them said \"Feed the kings and live like the masses.  Feed the masses and live like the kings.\"  Anyway, onto the food and experience.  I knew they would be super busy on a Saturday night, so I called in a to go order.  I was not surprised to hear the wait would be 1 hours and that was accurate.  I got to the restaurant, found a parking space (few people realize there's tons of parking behind it), and walked into the crowd.  The set up is far from efficient with to go orders as well as people waiting to be seated all crowded into the same tiny area at the front.  Also, this is a good haul from the kitchen so there is a lot of disconnect about whose order is ready.  After waiting in line for about 5 minutes, then paying, I waited about another 5 minutes to get my pizza.  My wings had been sitting in a clear plastic container with 2 cups of blue cheese at the counter the whole time.  My pizza was relatively cold when it was handed to me.    When I got home, the pizza was correct, but there were a couple of  issues.  First, the slices weren't cut all the way through.  Second, i got half beef and half black olives on it, but beef ended up on all but 2 of the 8 slices.  The dough was nice and thick, which is what I have always loved about MM pizza.  There was a little too much sauce on the pizza but it was okay (we almost always ordered their white pizzas before but I wanted a regular pizza this time).  The wings.  Oh the wings.  Probably the worst I have had.  Ever.  Anywhere.  Tiny, baked, pres-sauced, and possibly even parbaked?  I hope not.  The blue cheese was runny after sitting in the container for who knows how long.  I realize this place is new and slam packed, but please don't short cuts.    The 3 stars is because the pizza was actually good despite the issues with it.  I'll have to go back when they settle down a bit to dine in and hopefully bump them up a star, but I'll never get wings from them again.",

Other than that there were a few folks seated at the bar and MAYBE one or two tables inside (this was about 9PM).  Our server took our order and we never saw him again till much, much, MUCH later.  No one bothered to check on either outside table in the entire 45mins we sat there.  I had to go inside TWICE to ask the teenager who was filling the role of host where our server was as we needed a few small things.  After waiting 10mins after the first request and no one coming out, I had to go back inside and ask again.  Unbelievably, our server never did appear, so a while later, the host came out nervously with an order pad to take down what we needed (two waters and a side of marinara).  Then our long-gone server came out with our check like nothing had happened.  I could see if they were slammed, but the place was a desert, and there was another server working (yeah, actually WORKING) as well.  I doubt we'll eat here again.  The frustration level was off the charts.  Horrible!!!",

    "text": "It is what it is with this Mellow Mush :-) I first tried this place in 2013 when we first settled into Charlotte. If I'd reviewed then I would've given a 4 1/2 star rating. Since this initial visit the subsequent visits changed my perspective on this place especially in the realm of service.  The greeters are just not that into their jobs anymore. It's like pulling teeth with no novocaine to have them smile and appear happy about being at work and your visit which helps them stay employed (business ).  The food on the other hand is still tasty, also pies can get a bit pricey when choosing your own toppings so be sure to look over the specialty pies as you might see one with all you want and then some. They don't charge you to remove items from the specialty pie, I say go for them because they have a set price. We've ended up paying like double for a build your own when there was a specialty that had the ingredients (of course the server didn't inform us to help save us money :-(  The gluten free pies are the only item we've had that we didn't like AT ALL. gluten free doesn't mean TASTELESS but here it DOES :-(  Our favorite part of going here besides the food were the game tables upstairs which are no longer :-(",

Again, the buffalo chicken pizza is really awesome. The carmelized onions make the pie. It's about $25 for a large but worth it. Great the next day too so I look at it like it's multiple beers. I also had a beer at the bar while I waited to get it to go. Also a theme of my reviews lately. Great beer selection and fun to sit at the bar and watch college football.

    "text": "Went with a friend to grab a mighty meaty at 7:30ish on a Saturday night. As expected, the place was mobbed. Even with the place being packed we had a good experience. Didn't see any of the issues in previous reviews present. So either they are getting their shit together or it could be a case of yuppie Ballantyne folks getting butthurt cause of to of many \"skateboard looking kids\" working there. Anywho, i was prepared to wait. Got a buzzer thingy and was told 45 min. The bar was packed but we went around to the far side of it and were able to grab 2 stools. Got the beer menu, it looked a bit more expensive than the last Mellow i was at in Winston.  We asked about specials and one of the bartenders said they didn't have any but a passing server chimed in and let us know they had some drafts for $3, sweet.  A different bartender ended up taking our drink order and he was cool. Went with PBR's at first and then switched to the drafts with our food. Fyi: On the menu it says they are tall boy cans. They actually are only 16oz taller cans not the 24oz tallboys. O well. Within about 30 min our table was ready. Our server was super nice and very attentive considering how slammed the place was. Even asked us when our beers were only half empty if we wanted another brought out in about 10 min. Awesome. Our medium mighty meaty pizza was yum. Crust was very good and there were plenty of toppings on it. We were in and out in about an hour and a half(including wait time). The bill with one pizza and 4 beers came to $32. Not a bad deal at all. I will definitely be back. Stoked to have a Mellow Mushroom so close to the hizzouse.",

    "text": "Like many regular customers of the Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn, we were thrilled when we heard there was going to be a location closer to us in Ballantyne.  This review is based on our first three experiences at the new Ballantyne location. I have rated each visit separately below. My overall 2-star rating is based on a composite of all 3 trips there.  Visit #1 (3 stars) We first visited the new location a few days after they opened.  We expected that within the first few days, some things would be slower than normal and that's fine. We entered and found the lobby area to be chaos with people milling around either waiting to be seated or trying to figure out how/where to get takeout.   Seating:  We were finally seated after a reasonable wait. They took us to a section in the back near the kitchen. It's behind a wall and underneath the stairs. DO NOT ever let them seat you there. It was very loud and very cramped. There was a large group behind us and we might as well have been sitting at their table. I had to move my chair to the side of our table because as it was set up, the servers kept bumping into me every time they walked past. It's just really not a great set up.  The server was pleasant, but before we even ordered, she warned us twice that the kitchen was going to be very slow. OK, the warning was good and understandable for the first week.  Food:  Here is where we made our mistake. We ordered a 14 inch pizza but asked for some extra cheese. Just a bit extra, but not double the normal cheese. The pizza came out about 40 minutes later (slow kitchen) and was horrendous. There was so much cheese and sauce that you couldn't pick up a slice. It was not good, but in the kitchen's defense, we did ask for extra cheese. We ate with fork & knife because it was the only way to eat the goopy mess. Lesson learned:  No extra cheese.  Overall, we left unsatisfied with the pizza, but figured it was partially our own fault for asking for something different.  Visit #2 (5 stars) Our second trip was fantastic. We were seated quickly upstairs and the atmosphere was 100x better than the corner they put us in the previous time. Our server was friendly and fairly attentive. A manager stopped by to ask us how everything was.  The pizza (same order as last time, but WITHOUT the extra cheese) was perfect. It was the pizza we had come to expect from the Selwyn location.  All was good and we looked forward to our next visit.  Visit #3 (0 stars) It became very clear to us in our third visit that this restaurant is understaffed and overwhelmed.  Our third visit was greeted by the same entry area chaos as the first visit.  We were finally seated in a nice booth to the left side of the restaurant. Our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the exact same pizza as in visit #2 that we enjoyed so much.  The pizza took 45 minutes to arrive and our server kept coming by to apologize for the delays. The booth behind us was complaining constantly to the server about the wait.  The table to our side was served salad without dressing and had to wait a long time to get the dressing.  But, back to our pizza. Remember how wonderful it was in visit #2?  It was nearly unrecognizable.  The cheese was a soupy mess and there was a huge puddle of oil/grease in the center.  The cheese and sauce didn't go near the edges, so the crust was huge sections of bubbled dough with no toppings. We told our server that it didn't look good and she agreed.  Because we were in a hurry (and had already waited 45 minutes for the pizza), we decided to make the best of it and try to eat it.  The server said she would get a manager to come by. The manager never came. We did our best to eat the pizza. If I was MM management, I would be embarrassed to serve that pizza. We finally got our check and found that they had comped us for one soda.  Not the pizza, not two sodas.  One soda. Still no manager.  I asked for a to-go cup for my soda before we left and the server said she would get me one. Apparently, my request was rhetorical because we never saw the server again.   If this was our first trip there, we would never return. It was that bad. I hope management gets stuff ironed out quickly. It's apparent that the entry area needs to be changed/improved. They may want to move the takeout orders to the end of the bar or further from the masses waiting to be seated. Most disturbing so far has been the wild inconsistency in the pizza. We plan to give it another try at some point because we know how good it can be. Overall, it's only 2 stars for us.",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that I really like Mellow Mushroom and have been to several of their other locations in other cities along with their location on Selwyn.  I live in the area so I couldn't wait for the opening!  I went for a late lunch/early dinner on what was supposed to be opening day only to be told they didn't have their permits.  They did offer to let my daughter and I stay for a FREE meal to help train their staff.  That experience was really not bad.  The pizza was a little under cooked, but I figured they were in training.    I went a second time for my son's birthday for lunch.  It was busy, but we were sat in the bar area, which was no problem.  Although the service was fine, this time the pizza was over cooked.  I actually like my pizza on the well done side, but this was really over cooked:  brown cheese, hard crust, etc.    Finally, went last night for an early New Year's Eve dinner.  At 5:00, there was a 30 minute wait.  I wasn't shocked by this and decided to have a beer at the bar.  This is were things started to fall apart.  After receiving the beer menu, our bar tender disappeared.  After about 7 minutes, another bar tender asked if we put our drink order in yet.  When I replied that we had not, she proceeded to clean some dishes off the bar  left by another patron and went to take another customer's order instead!  When you have a bar that is that busy, you need experienced, competent bar staff.  We were finally seated at our table and, again, our pizza was way over cooked, lacked cheese, looked sloppy, and had very little of the topping I ordered.  The waitress was actually not too bad, but when I went to pay with my American Express, I was told the machine was down and I would need to pay with another card.  No problem.  I paid with my debit card only to realize this morning that I never received my card back from the waitress.  I called the restaurant this morning and was certain they would have my card since I know it was left there.  But- they could not find my card. I'm not sure if they even looked.    I am annoyed and disappointed and will have to wait for the kinks to be worked out.",

I didn't really think the food was that good , of what we had so most likely wont be back... its amazing on how much $$ was dumped into this space but you cant get good service!   The service was awful!",

    "text": "My wife and I were waiting for the opening of this location. We lived in the area last year and were disappointed as restaurant after restaurant closed in the area. Now let me state up front that I have always been a Mellow Mushroom fan. From the days of the early MMs that went bust about 4 or 5 years ago, to the locations in Greenville and Atlanta. So, giving this location on 3 stars was not easy... because I really went in hoping I would be giving them 4 or 5. We went on a Wednesday night and as expected with most new popular restaurants, there was a long line. Our wait was supposed to be 25-30 minutes and turned out to be about 45.  When we sat down, we waited almost 10 minutes for a waiter to show up. We had two children with us and ordered the PBJ and Mozzarella Meatballs for them. My wife and I ordered the Pizza. We all ordered sodas. The sodas for the kids did NOT come with lids. Now I'm not sure if YOU have ever gone to a restaurant with a two year old, but a drink with a straw and no lid is a recipe for disaster! One point lost there.  The kids meals came out after about 20 minutes. Both came with apples and the meatballs came out just right... not too hot for those little fingers and mouth, but warm enough that the cheese was still melted. One point plus there. The problem was this, the Pizza didn't come until a full 25 minutes after the kids meals! They were done eating, the two year old was ready to hit the road and Mom and Dad were JUST starting to eat. Two points lost there!!  The pizza was their special. Although it was good... it wasn't special. I couldn't say that there was anything special about it... just average.  Hence my rating. At this point, I would say that the restaurant is NOT child friendly. And to be honest, it wouldn't take a lot to get them to a place where I could say the restaurant is child friendly. They need to work on that. The servers seem confused, at best. The people beside us waited 45 minutes for their Pizza.... and I thought that was a little long for a Pizza.  So I wouldn't say no to going again... I will say that it will take me a while to go back. Hopefully they will work out the \"kinks\" by then.",

    "text": "I'm a ''Mellow'' from way back (1975) and have loved Mellow Mushroom throughout the years.  Mellow Mushroom is more than just good pizza, it's also atmosphere.  That atmosphere I would term as '70s, collegiate, ''laid-back''; that's a major area where the Ballantyne location fails for me as dining out is more than just eating food.   I was so excited to see that a Mellow Mushroom had come to Ballantyne as it's much closer to my home (and no, I'm not a yuppy).  I waited until March in hopes that all the new restaurant ''kinks'' would have been worked out, I even visited during a slow time.   My initial reaction walking in was that this was the first Mellow Mushroom that I'd ever been in that was trying NOT to be a Mellow Mushroom.  It had all the Mellow Mushroom trappings but instead of being fun, and cozy it was more urban and edgy(I will admit however, that I didn't get upstairs to see those cool tables!)  There were none of the cool college kids that most MMs have, nor the easy going cordiality that I've come to expect from MM...nothing but business here,,,get'em in, feed'em and get'em out.   Our waiter was okay and our pizza was okay, but just...okay.  Not wonderful like I'm used to MM pizza being.  Two specifics were that the pizza was lukewarm and the bacon didn't seem cooked through.  Usually I love having extra pizza left over to take home and have sometimes been tempted to order an extra one to  enjoy the next day.  Not this time, the flavors just didn't have ''heart''.   So, I guess I'll keep treking to Selwyn until the Rock Hill/ Fort Mill/ Steele Creek area gets a MM...someday.",

    "text": "My family and me (9 adults) ate early lunch here. The server was terrible. She acted clueless from the time we were seated at a booth. When the food was brought to the table, the  wrong food was placed in front of 3 people and my House pizza came as a cheese pizza. I got to sit and watch my family eat while I waited for another pizza to be made and baked. No one came to the table to explain. Thankfully my family shared some of their food with me while I had to wait another 15 minutes for my food. There was no apology, just the server removing the wrong pizza and telling me they would make and cook another one. My pizza came to the table about the time the others were finishing up their meals and asking for take home boxes. The manager was not at all concerned about this and no comp for my bill was even offered. Some people were offered drink refills others were not even spoken to. Not once in the hour+  we sat there was I asked if I would like more tea. The pizza was kind of bland and disappointing. I won't be eating here again and won't recommend it to anyone else more because of the bad service than the food.  Go elsewhere in Ballantyne to eat. The server missed a good tip because when I get good service I usually leave at least a 25% tip. She got $1 and didn't deserve that much. The wait staff is very under trained and clealry not there  for customer service or to be helpful and welcoming.",

Too many kiddos in here for my liking but not too rowdy. The decor is worth the trip, even just to see one time. The pizza was excellent, but took quite a while to reach us (around 45 minutes after we placed our order). I understand that the crust is made with molasses which infuses quite a unique taste. Our waiter was very accommodating and checked on us often without being intrusive. All in all it was enjoyable and we shall probably return.",

Just like Brixx and Cantina, this MM is big and spacious with patio seating and the same menu as the Myers Park location but there's something about it that's just lacking in umph. And it's not the tacky MM hippy vibe features (this one has it to) but perhaps it's the staff - they seem like they're working and not hanging out like the staff at MMMP does. Maybe it's the boring surroundings. Or the pain in the ass parking. Whatever it is, I don't love this MM and I don't hate it, but it's basically Myers Park's lame big sister to me.",

The bread was described as \"French\" and I would be hard pressed to call it that but I actually thought it was good because unlike a real baguette it was easier to bite into.  Dessert menu was not that interesting but when I'm in the area again I would still go back.  Plenty of vegetarian options to make me happy and all served in a fun ambiance.",

The service here was well below decent, the pizza was raw and the wait was an hour for two pizzas.  I counted 9 people working in the kitchen and over 12 working front of house. The restaurant was less then half way full and outside wasn't busy. There is no excuse to wait an hour for a half cooked pizza.  We asked the manager how much longer and without even an apology was told it should he soon. 30 mins later our pizzas came.  We witnessed one of the cooks take pills while working. Placing his hand to his mouth and then making a pizza without washing them.  This was by far the worst dining experience I've had in a long time.  If you want average pizza for two for $30 that comes with slow lazy service and a dry mouth cause your cup is always empty as well as a long wait then this is your place.",

Took 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Then while we were eating, the trainer waitress started clearing off a table (after complaining to another waitress about how it stinks to have to train) and she DUMPS A PITCHER OF BEER IN THE BUSH DIRECTLY BEHIND MY CHAIR.

Let's start with the two good parts of the visit. First, the pizza is always delicious. I travel for a living and have visited the locations in Winston-Salem, Selwyn, Johnson City, TN and Bentonville, Arkansas. Second, our server was accommodating and eager to please.   Now for the not so good to worse. My wife and I ordered a spinach salad to split. It was served to us on one plate, no big deal. When I got the plate to split the salad, it was filthy. I asked a bus boy politely for a replacement. He decided to tell someone else to get me a new one. OK, let it go. We both ordered diet cokes. They came and were undrinkable. The taste was indicative of a fountain line that needed attention, cleaning or was not working properly. I saw a server ( not ours) and asked if she could replace our drinks with unsweetened tea. She passed that duty onto the bus boy who never got me the replacement plate. The problem was as she asked him to do this I noticed him cleaning his nose on the inside of his uniform shirt. We didn't drink much of our tea. When our pizza came, the server left our used forks from the salad for the pizza. She took them off the plate with her hands and put them back on our table. This has never happened to me at a Mellow Mushroom. I shrugged it off but it bothered me. Why is this? You have a prime location with a great interior, yet the service is sub par and the cleanliness was an issue.   Some other things I noticed. There were staff members sitting at the bar. Is this a usual occurrence? I noticed the Manager on Duty. He seemed more interested in letting the servers know he was the boss rather than greeting customers and making sure their experience at Mellow Mushroom was positive and memorable. Moreover, I get the whole Mellow Mushroom tie dye thing. However, your manager was in need of a shave. Again, I tell you this because this experience was so unlike any other I have experienced at Mellow Mushroom. My hope is that your reigns get tighter and you give your location the personal attention it so richly deserves. Otherwise your customers will flock to  other options for dining.   Respectfully,",

When I got there, I found out that she rang up a regular small pizza instead of gluten free.  Mistakes happen, that is fine, but it is how the manager handled it that I have a problem with.  They obviously had to make the gluten free pizza while I waited, however, they did not remake the medium pizza or the Mac and cheese.  When I got home, I got to enjoy cold pizza and my daughter got to eat cold Mac and cheese.  The manager did not try to make things better by discounting our price or offering anything else.  This upsets me because we are regular customers.  We will now probably spend the extra 5 minutes of driving and go to the one on the. Selwyn.  Really unfortunate.  Just really peeved right now as I take another bite of cold pizza that I paid $15 for.",

Order wasn't ready when I got there 30 minutes after calling it in.  Order also wasn't quite right as they only had me down for a half size pretzel instead of the full-size I ordered (simple mistake no big deal) but that didn't upset me as much as them not having it ready.  The worse thing was that when I asked for ranch I had to pay for it ($60 on pizza and I can't get some ranch?) I get ranch every time at other locations and have never had to pay for it.  The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was because the hostess tried her best to apologize for the kitchens slow service and for being made to charge me for ranch.  Will take business to other locations that appreciate it.",

Our to-go order was a small instead of the medium we had ordered, so we had to wait for a new one.  Our guests who ordered food at the table received their food a long time before we received our pizza.  Hmmmm...?    Let's talk about our dining experience.  Our hostess, a very young girl was rude! She stared at our group the whole time and it was clear that she had some kind of issue going on.  Our manager seemed a little out of sorts but did his best to make up for the botched order (sorta).  What can I say...our waitress was awesome! She was engaging and very apologetic for the screw ups that the manager and kitchen made.  I've always enjoyed their food and the pizza was delicious...so three stars.",

Really nice chopped tomatoes on the crusty bread, the drizzled balsamic was excellent. Scooped up every little bit. Five pieces is a weird number - it does not divide very well!  Then the pizzas. Veggies for me and it was well loaded up. The crust was nice and crunchy but just a little doughy. I really enjoyed it and we brought half of it home. My daughter chose the Thai Dye and substituted tofu for the chicken. It was also tasty and the cucumbers on it really gave it a nice clean flavor. Yum!  Good service and good food. A solid \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" experience.",

    "text": "I've been to this Mellow Mushroom on many occasions and I figure it's time to give my thoughts. When you walk in you'll notice that this isn't your normal pizza place, the art decor is very eclectic and dated but it makes the place interesting. The customer service and staff seem to be on point but it can be hit or miss at this location because sometimes our orders come out right and sometimes we just end up with another bad experience because they didn't listen to our order. The time it takes to get the order is about average, there have been occasions  when the food is on time and others where it's disappeared into a blackhole and I have to constantly ask when will our food be ready.   The taste of the pizzas are decent but I'm comparing the taste to mom and pops pizza parlors where they know what they're doing and that's what they specialize in. The menu is very large because Mellow Mushroom tries to cover all their bases from burgers, calzones, hoagies and pizza and also there's a bar if you decide to just hang out. For me, it's too many choices and I don't think there's one thing Mellow Mushroom does extremely well. I prefer to stick with a normal pizza but you can order something off the wall funky if you choose and it'll probably be the best pizza you've ever had.   Mellow Mushroom, as other reviewers say is an interesting restaurant and I believe that they cater to a certain demographic which is their niche but for my taste and expectations, I believe I fall out of that niche. Not to take anything away from them but for me it's so so. Hope your experience is better than mine.",

They were a bit busy and the wait was unfortunately long that night, but that I think that was pretty atypical.

That being said...The fluffy crust and awesome toppings make for a great piece of pizza if you are in the mood to be creative.  We tried the buffalo chicken and it was pretty good.    One of my dining diva partners that evening tried the mushroom soup and couldn't shut up about it.  I hate fungus personally so I didn't try the soup but she LOVED it.  So, I guess it is worth mentioning.  I ordered the make my own salad with pesto chicken on top and that was pretty good as well.  The chicken seemed a little undercooked and the pesto seemed runny.  The chicken didn't necessarily seem marinated in pesto, it seemed topped with pesto-like sauce.  The chicken also didn't seem grilled.  It seemed...baked...for just a few minutes...  But it was certainly edible!  It was loud, babies were crying, there was a wait by 6:30, service was just okay, nothing special.  I don't see the big hype about this place.  It is overpriced for what they offer and I can get a bangin slice of pizza down the road from Tony's for 2 bucks.    Probably won't be a regular at Mellow Mushroom.",

After I ordered a pint of her finest, trance-inducing ale (which by the way they may have TOO many beers to choose from - I spent another couple of minutes getting the low-down on each of the local brews, which of course my waiter had a lot of \"uhhh I dunno what that one is, I can go ask\" moments) we crushed a meatball appetizer and had a large pizza with 'roni and fungus.    I will admit - the pizza was killer.  It wasn't the ole moon dog, watered down angry-as-hell Mellow Mushroom before they left Charlotte \"forever\" pizza... it was the good ole Mellow Mushroom pizza from back in the day before all the drama - delicious.  So 4 pints (that were on special), meatball appetizer (which is like 4 average sized meatballs) a large pie with 2 toppings... ~$50+tip  REALLY?  how is that a good family night value?  Our pizza was around $25 by itself!  That's ridiculous, and I don't care how good it tasted.  Honestly, for at least $10 cheaper a meal, Hawthornes is a way better value - the only reason to choose Mellow Mushroom is because they have those sweet Dyson-style hand air-blade dryers in the bathroom.  Maybe I'll stop into Mellow Mushroom to wash my hands on my way to Hawthornes - they're just the type of thing to keep the stoner in me coming back for more.",

    "text": "This is probably the raddest Mellow Mushroom I have ever been to.  Bf and I came here for some late-night food after a wedding.   We sat at the bar, had (somewhat warm) PBR and bruschetta appetizer while we watched some baseball on their flat screen TVs and waited for our pizza to-go.  That bruschetta came out really fast, and it was fresh and full of flavor.  The bartender was so nice that he gave me a Halloween decoration I admired after bf asked him where we could get one (look for the frankenstein lantern in the picture I uploaded)! The pizza we ate back at our hotel was buffalo chicken, caramelized onions and ranch, and it was delicious! We were going to get a medium, but it was going to cost us $20 as opposed to the $13 small. Twenty bucks is a little pricey I say, but we probably wouldn't have eaten more than the small anyways, so it worked out.",

Is it the atmosphere where all the yuppy kids are taking the kids to enjoy the hippy drug smoking culture?  Or is it just good food, with Psychedelic paintings on the wall?  I am unsure, but I can not see myself waiting more than 15 min to get into this place.  The food \"pizza\" was mediocre at best, and the place is filled with small kids (children).  Is this the atmosphere we are subjecting our children to?  Sure the pizza may be slightly better than Chuck E Cheese, but please......  All I could see around the place were phallic symbols and I was really not impressed.  So, I can say I have been here, done that, but it is definitely not on my be back anytime soon lists.  For all the hype, I am unsure, but it is in a great location.  NCFoodGuy",

They also have a good beer selection and the atmosphere is fun. They even have gluten free and vegan options for your annoying friends. You'll probably have to wait for a table during peak hours and your pizza might take a little while but that's because it is made with EXTRA LOVE.",

So we pulled in and wanted to see what all the hubbub was about.   Absolutely agree with all the hype about this pizza! OMG! We like crispy crust and it was a perfect crunch with some give, a softness inside it!  The toppings were so fresh and delish! Not greasy at all. I ordered a Specialty Pizza with s Trio ofMushrooms  and touch of BlackTruffle Oil. My husband, The Special with a side of banana peppers. Mine was a little rich but good so I ate by husbands with him. Simply yummy!   Oh, and while you wait for your zza, which is not too long, PLEASE have the Bruschetta! It was amazing. (Not the kind of bread that leave small, stinging cuts on your tongue and cheeks due to the age and staleness of the bread and then the tomatoes sting the little cuts. You know the stuff!)   WELL NOT HERE! simply DELICIOUS! Everything down to the iced tea! A great brew. Should have asked the server, who was ADORABLE and gave us GREAT service. I'm sure everyone but us has experienced Mellow Mushroom and you know already.  Great Service, Food & Drink Great Atmosphere!  If you haven't, it's well worth a few minutes in the car to get there!

Ordered through their app and totally misread the sauce choices so I ended up getting a Small Cheese pizza with olive oil/garlic sauce (YUCK), a medium buffalo chicken pizza (good) and the cheese bread (yuck). The cheese bread had WAY too much Oregano on it. They need to be on seasoning probation for how much oregano was used on the poor tiny slices of cheese bread. The cheese pizza was my fault but I do not recommend getting olive oil/garlic sauce. Just a lackluster order tonight and it was cold..thanks postmates :(",

Their wings are always a big hit but as of late they've been too generous on the drumettes and stingy with the flats. We ordered 10 wings for my daughter and she got 8 drumettes and 2 flats!! No bueno so you might want to clarify your desires right when you order.  I've used the yelp check in offer at two different locations and boy did the portion sizes differ. I ordered the hummus and pita and this location gave me a small scoop of hummus but when I was in Greenville they gave me a generous portion with plenty of pita. But I guess I can't complain about free.  What I love now as a new vegan (how long I'll last, I don't know) is that they have vegan pizza options! We ordered the vegan vegout pizza and they skip the buttered crust and substitute with vegan cheese! My daughter and I loved it but hubby wasn't feeling the vegan cheese. Texture issue he says. We've also had the Caesar salad (prevegan days), the Greek salad, the avocado sub and the tofu sub. All were great except the tofu sub! Too wet and too many soft textures.  I'm taking a star off because this place doesn't offer French fries! I know they don't have deep fryers but what about throwing them in the oven? And I asked for extra onions on my pizza and they charged me $2.00!! If the server had informed me that I'd be charged that, I would have skipped the extra onions. And I couldn't really tell that there was extra because it looked like it always does. Lesson learned!  The service here is always great and the manger has always come around to check on us so no complaints there. Great place for pizza and great place for vegans so they don't feel left out when eating out with family and friends.   That is all!",

The next time we ordered a pizza with light cheese, it was as if they thought we meant extra cheese. Still though, the pizza at MM is definitely delicious, with the best dough we have ever tasted. From the pizza to the appetizer pretzels, you won't be disappointed with the dough. It is so good. They now serve burgers, but at a pizza place, I'm not sure why they need to.   This location has great decorations, with a huge mushroom in the center of the restaurant. They seem to have an Aladdin theme going on, but an Alice in Wonderland theme would be more fitting with the giant mushroom.   This location has a bunch of televisions for your favorite sports watching, and it's a large restaurant with an upstairs balcony style section.   The wait staff are friendly, and parking is readily available in the private parking lot or garage of the center.",

So we called ahead to MM and they said the kitchen closes at 1pm. Our hostess sat us at a booth away from the bar/band scene and gave us all the menus.  Our waiter came up shortly after and took our beverage order. Upon his return we began asking some questions about the food; at that point he told us we could only order pizza and calzones!  And I work for a pizza calzone manufacturer, And I was drooling over a hoagie!  So my wife ordered a small pie for her and I had wings. We did realize that the prices were pretty high for pies.  Food came out fairly quickly.  The Jerk style wing flavor was very good; some of the best I've ever had since cooking with Jamaicans before. My wife enjoyed her pie as well, though don't care for the sweet oily style of crust. Our waiter was attentive and friendly.  The band was great that night. But we are still looking for that go to place in our area.",

I was  blown away by how the chefs are able to completely transform even the most basic pizza by adding their special ingrediants and flavor! :) For example, the Mediterranean pizza REALLY tastes like a Gyro! And the Mexican South of the Border Pizza really captures the taste of Mexican cuisine. Every pizza is so dramatically different and unique. There is something for everyone, vegetarians included. I cannot say enough good things about this place, I went there three times last week so that should speak for itself.. Safe to say this is one of my favorite things about the South sofar :) My friends up north are missing out!  If you haven't been here and you live down south.. What are you waiting for? They are everywhere around here, so check them out! Enjoy!",

We waited another 10 minutes and still nothing that our server sent the manager over.  In the meantime three other tables around us had gotten their food and left and they arrived after we did. When the manager came over he basically told us that pizzas took longer than what they ordered and walked away. No offer of a free soft drink or free dessert or anything like that for the hour that we had spent waiting for our food. Just really poor poor poor customer service. We will not go back again and we will tell all our other friends and valentine to go to one of the numerous other pizza places around. Bad news...bad customer service, and the manager had an \"I don't give a darn\"  attitude.",

    "text": "Not sure about the other locations, but the one in Ballantyne is horrendous. I mean one of the biggest cluster F's I've ever experienced in my life. They refused to seat us at a 2 top table in the outdoor area because a \"party\" was coming which NEVER came the 1.5 hours we were there due to terrible service. We were sat in the middle of the floor at a high top table and waited 10-15 min just for drinks. Ordered the mild wing appetizer to which the server said \"we don't have mild\" and which was clearly stated on the menu. Once bringing this to her attention the response was \"oh\". My wife ordered a Mr. Pibb and the server said \"what is that, I have never heard of it\". Uh, take a look at your soda machine like my wife did and you will clearly see Mr. Pibb as one of the options which is also clearly stated on the menu to which the server said \"Oh, I\"ve never heard it called that\". My wife specifically said Mr. Pibb because that's what they serve so I guess what it really says is that for our first time eating there we knew more about the drinks and menu option then our server did. The wings were horrendous with zero flavor and came with no dipping sauces and we ordered 1 ranch and 1 blue cheese. Another server realized this and kindly brought us what we ordered. 20 min after that our server finally came and took our order and when it came out she brought us the wrong pizza so we waited again for the correct one. We asked for utensils 3x and the restaurant said they \"ran out\" but again, another server kindly brought us some because our server couldn't seem to be bothered by bringing us any. This is after she tried to leave dirty appetizer plates that we had used for wings on the table and tell us to use those for our dinner. So to sum it up, long wait for food, incorrect order, no utensils, no napkins or plates, wrong order when it came out, incompetent server and manager who also couldn't remember jack crap, and food was bland and definitely not worth the wait or the $$$. I mean it starts at the top, so if the manager can't manage the restaurant herself then that explains the cluster for the rest of the restaurant. The manager asked us 20 min after we received our wings if they had ever came out, then we asked her for utensils and of course she didn't remember to bring any so what was the point. Do yourself a favor and don't let the \"cute little patio area\" draw you into this disaster of a so-called restaurant. There are plenty of others in Charlotte to choose from.",

Funny thing I asked to speak with a manager just to point it out... Tall skinny girl, she says oh we dress casual in mellow mushroom shirts... I looked at her and said what about you....

    "text": "I really like the food at Mellow Mushroom and I can honestly say I've never ordered anything I didn't like.  BUT, the most consistent thing about a Mellow Mushroom, regardless of the state or location is that the service is painfully, exasperatingly BAD!  We visited the Selwyn location about a year ago, and experienced the same bad service typical of other MM locations and never went back.  We headed out to this location at an off time - 3:00 p.m. on a Saturday - hoping that would improve our odds.  Not so.  Despite the place being half full, the three hostesses seemed confused and disoriented.  Lengthy wait for a server, we ordered our drinks and food (knowing you have to seize the opportunity at a MM), and after her departure a second arrived immediately after, confused someone else helped us.  10 to 15 mins go by with no drinks and another server notices us and asks if we've been helped.  Very nice of her to check, but who's running this ship?  Drinks did arrive and the salad and pizzas arrived relatively promptly for a MM.  The woman who set them down (yet another server), said my calzone was still cooking and would be out shortly.  Well, no calzone ever arrived and the rest of my family was almost finished by the time the server made it back.  She had no clue I'd never received my food. I told her I didn't want it anymore, given they were already finished.  She kindly found it in the kitchen, boxed it up and didn't charge us for it.    So clearly I'm the fool for trying MM again.  I think I've finally learned my lesson.  If I absolutely must have a MM pie, I'll get take out.",

    "text": "Finally the hype seems to have died down enough for us to check out the mushroom.  We arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday and had our seats by 6:45, so I can't complain at all about the wait time.   The service was GREAT, we were helped early and often by our waiter, who even brought out our daughters meal earlier than the pizza so she wouldn't grow too antsy.  Our pizza arrived in a timely manner, especially considering how busy the place was!  About the pizza... I personally thought that the sauce was way too heavy (just my personal preference though).  The crust is a really interesting flavor, that I can hardly describe in any other word except \"addictive\".  It has the texture of a soft inside of a fresh roll, but with a nice wheat flavor. All in all a great dining experience.   On a side note... My wife has an extreme allergy to latex, one of the biggest offenders on her list is balloon animals.  While this isn't something we come across a lot, we must be careful about balloons, unless we really want to use the epi-pen.  Tonight there was a young man making balloon animals for the kids at various tables.  I explained the situation to our waiter, who was very accommodating in helping us out by keeping the balloons far away from our table.  So, kudos to them for understanding the out of normal allergies that are present and helping everyone enjoy a great dining experience at the same time.",

The portobello mushroom appetizer is not listed as a salad but comes on a bed of arugula with a delicious creamy garlic sauce drizzled over it and is fantastic. I had my first beer cheese here and it was delish. It's a fondue like mixture of beer and cheese just in case you weren't sure. It went extremely well with the pretzels they serve it with which are made from their one of a kind pizza dough. Their dough is so soft and uniquely them, it just can't really be compared to other pizza dough. I think they use whole grain flour, yet it isn't cardboard like. The mushroom pizza is really really good and again has said creamy sauce drizzled all over. They offer a wide selection of beer on tap including several hefeweizens and a raspberry wheat which I loved. On certain nights they have entertainment, I've seen a DJ and some trivia games being played that anyone could participate in if they were staying for a while. Each time the service was speedy, friendly and humorous. Definitely at the top of my list for pizza night out.",

We have spoke to the manager several times who assured us she would credit us back but as of 5/1/2012, we still haven't seen any credits. The manager told me she would send a gift certificate today so we will see what happens....",

I know this sounds terrible, but the server also smelled and most of the wait staff seemed to just be wandering around. It was odd.  The  one positive about the place was they actually had several choices for gluten free pizzas!!",

Kids were able to check out the state of the art video conferencing and few little surprises.   So we came here around 4:30p and even though that place was pretty empty, it took them long time to set everything up. Kids were having fun hanging around water fountain in front of the restaurant. We were called in after twenty five minutes.   We were seated on patio outside and the waitress took our drink order. Drinks came back in fair amount of time and we were ready to order. We decided what we were going to order as a group and placed the order. Even though the place was pretty empty as I stated earlier, it took them long time to bring few pizza.   Over all, we enjoyed the atmosphere and the company. Personally, I didn't think the pizza were great. They could also improve on their speed.",

The crust was surprisingly good, but outside of that, there's not much to boast about the pizza.    Going with one person made our wait time non-existant for dinner. Other people looked like it was going to be significantly longer. Atmosphere was pretty cool with all the colors and decorations, plenty of large-screen televisions. Sadly, it gets a little too loud.   Service was okay. Go with a mellow attitude and not be in too much of a rush.   Nice beer selection.   Ballantyne is sorely lacking a great pizza place. Your best bet is Wolfman Pizza, but that's a bit of a drive depending on where you are.",

The decor is very different, goes well with the name of the restaurant. I had no idea so so many kids would be there with balloon animals. Side not I am not fond of kids with balloons cause they handle the balloons roughly and the balloons pop and then I jump.. lol. The screen on our table didn't work, so that was bummer. Not sure what it does anyway but I wanted to find out.  Anyway, it was extremely loud in the restaurant. Our server was nice and did a great job making sure everything was fine.   My husband and I ordered the pretzel bites and the order came out wrong but was fixed right away which was great but I was disappointed with the bites. They are not pretzels just small pieces of bread. Really need to change the name to something else. They tasted fine but was a waste of money cause it tasted just like the pizza crust.  We also ordered a large pizza with 3 toppings and soft drinks. The pizza crust was okay, but the toppings were plentiful, so a plus there. Glad we visited, enjoyed the decor, the TV channel near the bar and the service. Not so much the noise, kids running around, and the so called pretzel bites.",

The waiter said next, \"but Like where\". If you are intending to move them then find a place, we don't work there ,you do. So I was already a little annoyed by that. Then we get our appetizers and my friend is vegan so this was all he was eating and he said the salad tasted unwashed. My pretzel bites got there and they were Burnt. I asked the people if they would change it because I like the pizza bites like they are supposed to be. The rest of my time there they were looking at me and my friends and pointing. Also They were yelling right next to my table about something. The servers attitude was just unacceptable I was so appalled by the behavior. I didn't feel wanted here I'm sorry but it just wasn't it.",

Crust was perfectly hand tossed and red sauce nicely light without chunks of tomato as is signature of Leonardo's in Gainesville Florida.  Most decorated Mellow at which I have eaten. Pizza was worth the wait.  Our sever, Brook, was perfectly attentive.    It was a very active Friday night with many family groups. Fun for kids.",

    "text": "Though I live in Charlotte, this week marked the first time I ate a Mellow Mushroom here in the city. I've been to the Blowing Rock location many times before and since I enjoy it, I decided to stop in for a quick bite to eat while I was in Ballantyne. Things got off to a slow and rocky start. The server, while nice, was not very attentive and it took awhile for the appetizer to arrive. It also took nearly an hour for the main dish to come out, and once it did it was over cooked. I didn't eat much of the food because it wasn't enjoyable, so after a few bites I was ready for my check so I could go as I didn't plan to spend an hour and a half there. The server was no where in sight, so I thought I was going to leave with a bad experience. Luckily the manager or owner (not really sure of his name or title because he didn't introduce himself) clearly saw something was wrong and rectified the situation. He approached my table on his own and offered to have a new order prepared for me and took things a step further by not charging me, which took me by surprise, especially because I didn't flag him down and ask for any of this. I give this place four stars because in the end I was given great service and delicious food that wasn't burned. Because of this I would return to this location  and give it another chance.",

We had the sweetest waitress, Maggie-- who was patient with me as I struggled to decide what to get.  When my Holy Shitakke Pizza came and had aioli sauce, which contains mayo, something I cannot eat, it was promptly taken from the table with an offer for something else.  Even though, the pizza was not perfect (for me) because of my unique preferences, the service was GOLDEN.  We couldn't have been treated better, and I will take good, kind service any day over a perfect meal delivered without love.  Thanks for a lovely birthday dinner.   Our Cheesy Garlic bread was magical as always as was the Mel Corleone Pizza.  We will be back!",

Not a True calzone!!!  1 Pizza was perfect yet our other veggie pizza was burnt and slightly sparse on the toppings.. meh!  We have driven by Mellow Mushroom 100x and never felt a thought to try... till now. We took out their Gluten Free Pesto Veggie, And a Marinara Meat \"Gluten Free\" Pizza. 1- the Flavors were Very Good! 2- for A gluten Free Pizza it wasn't bad, coming from NYC, there are better Gluten Free crusts, this is about middle of the road but way better than stuff I had 17 years ago Gluten free lol 3- Meat pie was VERY good, and plenty of toppings but the Pie size aren't very large for the price paid! 4- Pizza was hot, sauce was good, and well balanced.  Unfortunately, It always seems more expensive to eat healthier or different than normal, and there doesn't seem to be an economy of scale to bring costs down yet. We will definitely go back, and hope there are better values than $40 for two medium pies!!",

They tried to seat us in a small area near two groups with many small children.  When I asked to be moved, we got a table with an out-of-order electronic screen in the tabletop.  This would not have been an issue, except that the wires kept getting tangled around our feet.  I had to get up and go to the host/hostess station to retrieve our silverware.  I even had to ask the three people at the station to excuse me while I reached past them to the bin.  Other servers brought us our app and entree, but I had to wait for our table server to return for drink refills.  Food was really nothing special.  In fact, the pizza was more on par with Chuckee Cheese or Cici's.  Certainly not gourmet.  We did see the manager once, when he approached our table.  In general, though, we did not see him leading activity on the floor.  In general, we had less than average food and indifferent service.  There are much better options in this area.",

And for $13-$17 for what is basically a medium pizza I just can't help but feel that it's simply not that good.  Service is lacking to say the least and wait times even when slow can be way too long.  45-50 mins for thin pizza!?    My wife is gluten free and her pie was very lacking.  She compared it to having cheese and sauce melted onto a chip.    Brixx makes arguably a better pizza and is definitely more reasonable at $8-$10.  They make a very good gluten free pizza as well.  Also you are eating your Brixx pizza within 15-20 mins max.   Mellow Mushroom has fun decor and an eclectic menu but they're not enough to outweigh the negatives.",

    "text": "Mellow isn't the best pizza in town, but if you're looking for some decent pizza choices in a \"sit-down\" atmosphere then you really can't go wrong. Kind of an oddball location for Ballantyne Commons, but seems to be flourishing rather well.   This placed is slammed from being in the \"burbs.\" Venture in on a Friday evening or any mealtime hour on the weekend and....well, let's just say that you'll have fun holding your pager whilst waiting for your table to clear.   Not too impressed with their pizza. The mega veggie and white pizza are really flavorful but every time I've been, you have to \"fork and knife\" the pie. A little too flimsy to hold and very, very, very, very greasy. I can appreciate a good fork and knife pie, but typically when its going to be Chicago style.   Great beer choices. Love that they have some great micro, craft and macro brews on draught. The bar is perfect to squeeze into if you're looking to grab a quick meal and brew with your wife, buddy or if you're flying solo.   The place is decorated to the gills in vibrant hippy art. If you're into that....you might as well fill out an application.   Service is always friendly and fast. Never had any problems or negative experiences in the few times I've been.   Definitely order the pretzels (pizza dough inspired). They are TO DIE FOR.   Also, the spinach artichoke dip is the best my wife and I have ever had.   Caprese is always a standard choice.   If you're headed there for pizza, you really can't go wrong with any choices. Just heed my previous comment. If you choose not to fork and knife your slice, you'll probably end up wearing it.   Definitely worth a try if you haven't had the Mellow experience yet.",

Of course, it can't be compared to the privately owned pizza places, but considering it's a chain, their food is alright. That being said, the atmosphere is what confuses me. if I had kids, I wouldn't bring them here. Psychedelic designs all over the place, magic mushrooms suspended everywhere and loud music playing... That doesn't sound exactly kid-friendly to me. But these guys surely must have their \"colorful\" atmosphere confused with a kids hang-out because they have these balloon boys twisting balloons for kids. Also, halfway thru my beer I noticed a fruit fly floating about. I seriously don't know if it just got in there or if it was there all along, floating in my drink, but just covered up with the froth. Either way, I don't want to think of it. I told our server and she offered to get me another one, but by then I was done with my dinner so I just let it pass and they didn't charge us for the fruit fly beer. Speaking of servers, it was particularly difficult to catch a hold of our original server, but I would overlook that because the place was really packed.",

Maybe they had their best employees working, since it was a Friday night? Who knows.   Anyways, this place was packed, so there was a wait, but we managed to snag a few seats at the bar while we waited on a table. The bartender was attentive and even made conversation with us, despite the fact that he was quite busy. It seemed like he was giving everyone that same level of attention, which is pretty impressive.   Once a table opened up, we were seated, and our waitress immediately took our orders. The pizza took a little while to arrive, as is the Mellow way, but once it showed up, it was piping hot and delicious.  So, all-in-all, we had a good night. The service and food were at least comparable to the (smaller) Selwyn location. I wouldn't recommend the Mellow Mushroom for a romantic date night or for when you need to be in and out quickly, but if you just want to hang out, you can do so very well here.  PS And yes, people, it's expensive, but no more expensive than any other MM. The pizza's better than take out... you get what you pay for!",

The first time we tried, we were told there would be a 60 min wait, and coming in the late weekend afternoon seemed like the best time to get in.  The table they chose for us, though, was in some weird little section right adjacent to the kitchen; combined with the hard surfaces and odd angles of the area under the stairs, the noise was just horrible. We finally got moved to a table under the balcony, which was much better.  The wife is on a gluten-free diet, so seeing that they offered a gluten-free pizza, there was much rejoicing in the land. Unfortunately, the pizza they served us wasn't a cause for celebration. It was what they termed a \"Hawaiian\" (red sauce, mozzarella, ham, pineapple), but aside from a lot of sauce, there were hardly any toppings on the pizza, most especially a lack of cheese.The pizza was for someone on a gluten-free diet, not someone who is lactose intolerant. It was a really, really weak offering. It also arrived to the table warm (certainly not hot), which suggested it had been lounging in the kitchen awaiting our server to bring it to us.   Ultimately, a medium pizza, a small salad, a local beer and a diet Coke came to $36 with tip. On the one hand, not an outrageous sum, but on the other, far too much to pay for mediocrity, which is what we were presented today. For $20 we can get a frozen Bella Monica gluten-free pizza at Earth Faire which is superior in every way to what was served \"fresh\" today  I don't know if we will ever return--I suppose we will, assuming the tenor of the reviews here improves over what has been posted to date--but this was a massive disappointment on every conceivable level. Management would be well-served to shut the place down for a week and review staffing, training and procedures before claiming to be a professional restaurant.  ***1/5/12 SPECIAL BONUS UPDATE to include the oh-so-helpful comments from \"Hot potcket T.\" (no, that's not a typo)  \"Sir you're an idiot for even taking that much time out of your day for that one particular comment. I see your pizza wasn't cut thoroughly but I would assume you know what a knife is!? Or maybe \"the wife\" could help you. I'm sure they would love your business and for you to come back but they would also love patience. They did open 2 weeks ago! And you obviously know NOTHING about the restaurant biz bc you can't just shut down a restaurant that's already open to train people, again! Please think before you speak.\"  It is always impressive when someone, brave with equal parts righteousness and anonymity, rushes to call another person \"an idiot\" in a preamble to an error-filled message.  1) I wrote nothing about how our pizza was cut. That was *another person's review*.  2) I acknowledged in the opening paragraph that the restaurant recently opened. I would never pan a restaurant based upon an opening weekend. On the other hand, this is a formula restaurant and part of a local chain, so it isn't as if everything is unique to this Ballantyne location, and we didn't go in at a peak time, either. I've done my tour of duty in a pizza joint, too, and when the kitchen is run well, it is relatively easy to keep the customers happy and get the pies delivered without excessive wait times.  3) The comment about shutting down for a week was such obvious hyperbole that it only makes sense that \"Hot potcket T.\" was lost at sea. I think most everyone realizes that it isn't cost-effective to shut down a restaurant for a week to retrain unless Gordon Ramsay is doing the retraining and the TV show he's filming is covering the lost operating revenue. I was merely stated that the restaurant appeared so rough around the edges that it would benefit from a week offline just to get its house in order.  4) Finally, the comment that Mellow Mushroom would appreciate \"patience from me\" is just bizarre; I didn't dictate when the restaurant was obligated to begin operations, so if it needed more time, then an internal decision was made to open regardless of readiness. Furthermore, nobody offered to cut me a deal on the pricing of our food if the restaurant felt it wasn't ready for prime time. If I'm paying full fare, I think as a customer I have a right to that restaurant's full level of service. Why am I supposed to cut it some slack if it's going to charge me the full price for what it acknowledges isn't it's best effort?  If the Ballantyne Mellow Mushroom is truly run by professionals--that is to say, not by whiny twits like \"Hot potcket T.\"--they they will take some of the comments from the *paying customers* here to heart and work to improve the restaurant.",

I have found I get much better service at the bar than at a table, but it's still not stellar. Upon coming in, the five employees standing at the hostess stand made it seem like they were doing me a favor to stop their conversation and acknowledge me. I ended up going to the bar just to spite them.   The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable about the beers, but not the wines. Also, the service was pretty slow - once I got my initial drink, it was hard to get them to look at me again. I will say the vegetarian selection are great and tasted good. The pizza is also pretty good, mainly because of the crust. The wings are lackluster and small. I ordered a cookie to take with me and it took 15 minutes for someone to bring it out. This made me think it was being baked fresh or something but it was just a cold, not-so-special cookie probably made the day before.  This place competes directly with Duckworth's so my prediction is the one with the better food and service will be the one to survive.",

    "text": "DUDE MELLOW MUSHROOM IS AWESOME!   The boyfriend and I went on a Thursday night with two of our close friends. We were surprised that they were so busy on a weeknight. We didn't want to wait, but we were assured that we'd be seated as quickly as possible so we headed to the bar for a drink. OOOH, the beer selection! They have a lot of draft beer and we all tried something new!   We only waited about 15 minutes before we were seated at a lovely booth with funky designs... very snazzy! Our waitress was adorable and  sweet and greeted us very promptly with a smile. She told us our pizza would be \"made to order\" (which is amazing to me being that I've worked in the restaurant biz before!) so we ordered some appetizers to munch on and they came out fairly quickly.  We all shared a bruschetta and spinach dip both of which were quite possibly the best I've ever had anywhere.   We ordered a large house special pizza to share between the four of us, and after the beer and appetizers It was definitely enough for us all to split! They do not skimp on the toppings or cheese! It was so delicious that there were no leftovers, not even the crust was left on the plate!   All in all, the experience was great. The pizza was totally worth the 25 minute wait! (just like our waitress said!)  We will definitely be going back next week!",

I would have to say you can't compare it to your regular pizza joint, to me it's apples and oranges. I liked the pizza because it was different and the molasses in the dough gives it the unique texture/taste. It was crispy thin in the middle with a thick crust on the outside. I had the Philosopher's pie and my husband had his own with pepperoni and mushroom. We also had the tortilla soup and the stuffed portabello mushroom for an appetizer, both were excellent! Another plus was the long list of beers on tap. Decor inside was fun. The only complaint (well not really a complaint) is that we dropped $50 on lunch for 2. I guess its on par since it's more like a gourmet pizza place.  We went during lunch and at around 12:30 there was no wait (it was a really early lunch for us!).",

He said 25 minutes.  25 minutes later I arrive and he checks on my meal.  \"3 more minutes in the oven,\" he says.  Ok, great.  Pizza will be piping hot.  We live 5 minutes away.  By the time I got home, the meatballs were hard as rocks and inedible.  The pizza was lukewarm to cool.  Was definitely NOT right out of the oven and in fact seemed to have been sitting there awhile.   The crust and pizza is so stellar at Mellow Mushroom.  The steam inside the pizza box ruins the crust and turns the pizza rubbery.    I still give eating in 5 stars....2 for takeout.  Solid 3 overall.",

We have had some good servers and a handful of bad ones. So just be aware. I know that comes with any place but just know we have never had consistent service.",

Had to request silverware and napkins more than once.  Waitress would come to refill empty water glasses and only refill one before promptly abandoning the area for an extended period of time.   Ordered  a side salad, one small pizza and one calzone.  With tip it averaged 17 per person.  I think 34 dollars is a little steep for a very small pizza, a salad and calzone.   Probably will not return to this restaurant which is disappointing because I used to really enjoy their pizzas about 15 years ago.",

The manager Dave Nelson not only acknowledged the situation, he rectified the situation sincerely and went above and beyond to ensure I was properly taken care of. The end result was some of the most delicious food served hot & fresh!!!",

We ordered the Mediterranean pizza, thanks to yelp when i checked in they offered a free humus or bruschetta with the order of a pizza , so that was a big plus.

However, my breadsticks with cheese and Greek salad wasn't anywhere around. Staff went back and said it would be up shortly. I sat and waited until 9:24 PM, I looked up and saw the words; \"patience is virtue\" on something in the restaurant. I got up to check, as it seemed that no one else was concerned.   I asked the young lady and while doing that, the manager came over with a little discount card of sorts for \"the next time\". I don't know what made him think there would be a next time, but I told him I wouldn't use it, he placed it on the counter and walked away. Hmmmm, okay no there's nothing else you could've done to make me return. Sarcasm...  My food came about a minute later. The same pizza, a salad and my bread. I get back to eat and my drink is watered down, there is no dressing on my salad, nor was I offered any, my pizza was luke warm and my fresh from the oven bread was surprisingly NOT hot.  First time and last time; for some reason I thought they were like a Brixx, I hate that my expectations was so high because now I'm really disappointed and I probably won't eat most of it. $20 wasted...And, I had to spend $2.00 more to buy another drink. #nomoremellowmushroomever",

The service is never speedy, it sometimes takes 5 minutes or more just to have our drink order taken, and the food takes anywhere from 35-45 minutes.   The mushroom soup is the best thing on the menu. The pizza is pretty good, but there is better across the street in either direction. And the calzones leave something to be desired. They have a good choice of ciders, and mostly have good drink specials. Good for a group, but not for a date.",

    "text": "In general I have enjoyed Mellow Mushroom pizza for several years. I first started going to a restaurant when I lived in another state. When we moved here, we dined in at the Myers Park location and had no issues. When MM opened a store in Ballantyne, we started going to that one as it was closer to our home.   The Ballantyne location does not seem well managed. The staff seems very young and  they do not seem very well trained. We have experienced incorrect orders, incomplete orders, and just plain bad pizza that had skimpy ingredients. From day one, we have had spotty service and food quality from this location, especially when we do take out. Sometimes they are on and other times just AWFUL.  They lack consistency and you never know what you are going to get.   I no longer have faith that when I place an order, they won't somehow mess it up. Their crust is good but you do not want to pay $27 for a large specialty pizza and have mostly crust.  They have been scrimping on ingredients IMHO. Their food is not cheap, so there is no way they should be skimping on ingredients.  The last time we placed an order they somehow got our name wrong and we arrived to pick it up, they stated there was no order in our name. After much confusion, they realized the person who took the order put down the incorrect name. We ordered the Funky Q. Chicken and when we got it home it looked like the chef had dumped all the ingredients in the middle and not bothered to evenly distribute them throughout the pizza. You would think that the main ingredient chicken would be prevalent all over the pizza but there were slices that had none.  In fact, it had more bacon than chicken on it, which would have been great if we had ordered a bacon pizza. However, we were expecting a BBQ chicken pizza. VERY DISAPPOINTING!  If you want pizza in the Ballantyne area, I would recommend trying somewhere else.  I no longer feel MM is worth the price charged.  UPDATE:  In addition to writing this review, I decided to write a note on MM's website regarding our experience. Within a few days, I received a call from the Director of Operations who apologized. He stated the restaurant was under new management and advised that  the new manager would be  addressing a lot of issues at the restaurant. He stated he would send out a gift card as a way to make up for our bad pizza, which I eventually received  I give them credit for acknowledging  the complaint and trying to make it right.  2nd Update 4/11/16: They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. That definitely applies in this situation. A year after the above experience, I foolishly ordered another takeout pizza, hoping they had resolved their issues. We were taking dinner to a friend who had requested this Mellow Mushroom. Against our better judgement, we ordered the Funky Q Pizza again- I hoped that they had really gotten their act together. We had much the same result- crust, bbq sauce cheese and little chicken. They tried to camouflage the pizza with lots of sauce and cheese so we really couldn't tell how little chicken it had but when we bit into  a slice,  we easily determined that they had once again skimped on the ingredients. That is apparently standard practice for this restaurant. They really should be ashamed in the quality of pizza they are allowing to leave their restaurant. A large is $25 and you have to wait 45 minutes to pick up an inferior pizza. Not worth it!   I am DONE  with Mellow Mushroom. If you want pizza in Ballantyne try True Pizza or better yet, do a takeout pizza from Harris Teeter. Their bbq chicken pizza is better than MM and a lot cheaper.",

    "text": "My \"usual\" Mellow Mushroom trip involves me going over to the Selwyn location, but this new\"er\" location in Ballantyne may change my mind!  Went over here after running a half marathon on a Sunday so we were pretty starved for food by the time we got there.  The best thing is that we got there right at twelve [on a Sunday] which = cocktail time especially after running that far and for that long.  I partook in the special $4 Bloody Marys... I love that the server asked me if I liked them \"extra spicy\"  and they totally were worth the extra spice!!  We sat upstairs with the awesome touchscreen tables... so we were thoroughly entertained by the games and multi-media while waiting for our food.  Made the time go by so much faster... especially since the MM always cooks their pizzas to order and there can be a bit of a wait time.  The other thing I did not know was that each MM location has their own unique pies... so I definitely tried one of them:  The Boozer.  Beer cheese, Canadian bacon, bacon, mozzarella, and grilled chicken.... pretty darn tasty and great!  Our server Morgan was super attentive and nice and made sure we were totally happy during the whole experience.  I was even thanked by the host/tess table by 3 of their servers when I was leaving, which really makes for a nice way to end the meal (also another excuse to go back and hang out with really nice folks....).",

Clever decor and good for kids, esp birthday parties as they have an upper tier that would contain them and not bother the other diners.  That is the good part.  The pizza was flavorless, life Figaro's.  With just sauce it would actually BE cardboard.  On the thick side, no aroma, touch and in our case burned.  Even with toppings it was nothing more than a bad pie.  This was dinner time and the floor was dirty and unswept.  At least they could have swept the dirt somewhere or picked up the napkins and other debris from previous diners.  Agh!  Server was nice and young.  Young as in she was not an experienced wait person so she just took the order and got it out.  When we signaled, best to stand and wave one's arms, she would come by and then go get more iced tea.  Other wise, we were not there.  For an expensive $24.95 large pizza I would expect better.  Bar looked busy and wish we had seated ourselves there, at least to get more attentive service.  Why do people come here?  Are there that many people without taste buds?  Guess so.",

    "text": "On Sunday afternoon we decided to check out Mellow Mushroom, hoping it wouldn't be too long of a wait, as the shopping center and other resturants looked pretty crowded.  We arrived just around 12 and were seated right away, but within 30 minutes every table was full.  And, after our experince and food I know why.  We started off enjoying the $4 bloody mary special with chicken wings, mild sauce.  The drinks were great and the wings came out piping hot and were delicious..next time I might spice it up and go a little hotter though. After looking over the menu and having never been we decided to split a hoagie and pizza.  We chose the steak and cheese hoagie and the classic white pizza, with grilled chicken. The white pizza was light, creamy, and ha a great crispy, but not too thin crust.  Loved it! As for the hoagie, I unfortunately only got one bite but my friend loved it and ate the whole thing, plus a slice of my pizza!  Our waitress was very friendly and we were even approached by the Manager making sure everything was going well.  I definitely look forward to my next visit and want to say thanks to the staff who made our first visit very nice!",

Trashy part #2, the menu that we were given at the bar looked like it had been through Benghazi without additional support.  3. Bartender with a bandana was drinking more than one \"sample\" at the bar. This is 100% illegal according to NC ABC.  4. They messed up the guy next to us order, he wanted his hoagie in a pita and it came on a bun. They were going to correct it but the guy said he'd just got to Duckworths.  Let's just say Marcus Lemonis would have a fit if he walked into this place tonight. What a disgrace to all restaurant establishments. The only reason we sat down was because there weren't any seats at Blackfinn tonight.  We won't be back.",

We looked them up online to make sure we knew what we were getting and the service was pleasant, the food however leaves something to be desired. The meatball sub was super messy, over sauced, which made the bread soggy and the cheese was stuck to the wrapper. The steak sub, which we special ordered to have no mayo, in fact did have mayo and this made it inedible for one of us. The pretzel bites tasted more like garlic knots, but to be fair I think that was what they were going for. Sorry, but not worth the $25 we paid for it all.",

I won't go near this place on the weekends, let the rest of south Charlotte wait in line and skip on over to the other place by 'Toast' on Rea Rd.

    "text": "My husband, son and I have been Mellow Mushroom fans for a few years and often look for one when on vacation and in need of a pizza night.  We have eaten at MM in various locations including Orlando, Myrtle Beach, and the Selwyn location in Charlotte.   Since we have a couple of local pizza places that we really like and often order pizza on a whim, we really don't think of MM when we are looking for pizza at home.  Until that last night, that is!!!   There were 4 of us (me, husband, teen son, and my Mom... who had never been to MM) and we all loved the food, the atmosphere, the service, and the balloon creations.  We got there before the Saturday dinner rush and we were seated right away.  The decor is typically MM style in updated form so the colors and vibe are fantastic.    My Mom was going to have a salad instead of pizza until we all said that she was CRAZY to even think of such a thing!  Boy, what she glad we talked her out of it!   The boys ordered the House Special Pizza (minus ham and black olives) and my Mom and I ordered the Holy Shitake Pizza.  Although medium-sized pizzas would have been enough, we all look forward to leftover pizza for breakfast so we went with the large pies.  My son also had a small Caesar Salad and it enjoyed it very much.  The pizza took approx 25 minutes to arrive at the table and it was well worth the wait!  They were both piping hot, smelled fantastic, and looked gorgeous!  (See pictures)  Both pizzas were incredible, but the Holy Shitake Pie is off-the-hook crazy wackadoo delicious!!!!  A fluffy, buttery, parmesan cheesy crust topped with a magical blend of garlic, gourmet mushrooms, and garlic and baked golden grown.  Then, to make it even better (as if that was even possible), they drizzle the pie with a garlic sauce, too.   YUM!!!!!   The pie is totally crave-worthy and will be solely responsible for all of my future visits to MM!  My Mom absolutely loved it too and we both went as far as to say that it was one of the tastiest and most delicious non-traditional pizzas that we have ever eaten.  I don't know why we never tried this one before?!?  In the midst of my cosmic mushroom bliss, I did manage to have a bite of the House Special pizza and it was quite good, too!  The bite that I had Applewood Smoked Bacon, Ground Beef, and veggie and it was very tasty!  I'm not typically a fan of ground beef on pizza, that bite changed my opinion.  The boys loved their pie, too!  The server was very attentive and quite personable.  The Manager stopped by to say hello, too.  We were even greeted by a Balloon Creation Specialist (I just totally made that name up, BTW).  He was very friendly and quite talented.  Since it was dinnertime on a Saturday night, there were tons of kids in there (who were actually all all quiet and well-behaved from eating delicious pizza...bonus!!) the Balloon Man was making tiaras, motorcycles, swords, etc.   Then he came to our table and things went a little bizarre (in a good way).  He asked my 14 yo son what he wanted and my son made the mistake of saying \"anything will be fine\".  Mr. Balloon Man's eyes lit up with excitement and he got started on a Pink and Red swirled hat with a 2 ft antennae and a giant powder blue heart attached at the end.  Luckily, my Son has a great sense of humor and is very easy going...I don't know that all boys would have taken so kindly to it.  It was quite funny!  (see picture)  What I really like about MM is the quality of the ingredients that they use.  Their crust is made is unbleached wheat flower, their meats are flavorful and delicious, and many of their toppings are organic.  If you're a die-hard NY style pizza lover, then MM is not for you.  But, if you enjoy a fluffy, flavorful, and buttery crust with excellent toppings and tasty sauces, then you must give MM a try!    So...after reading this glowing review, you're probably wondering why only 4 stars instead of 5?  There is one reason, and one reason only....the price.  For 2 large pies, 1 small salad, and 2 soft drinks the bill came to $63.00!  Yes, the food was excellent.  Yes, they use high quality ingredients.  Yes, the experience is lively and fun.  BUT, the practical side of me says that $63.00 for 4 people to eat pizza is just plain crazy!!!   Will it stop me from going back again?  Heck NO, but MM will be a \"once in a while\" pizza outing and won't make it to our in-a-pinch pizza list.    As a side note, I just re-heated a leftover slice of Holy Shitake in the oven and had it for breakfast (yes, I am NOT too proud to admit that) and it was just as delicious as it was last night....maybe even better since it caused the garlic sauce to melt into the pizza a bit.  Sadly, there's only piece left now and it's \"supposed\" to be my Mom's slice.  We may have to arm wrestle for it...and, yes, I'm not too proud to admit that either!   LOL",

As a vegan their gluten free crust and Daya \"cheese\" option is the best thing that could have happened to me and my relationship with pizza. They're really friendly in this location and helpful too. The pizza itself could take a little while to come out but as long as it tastes good and everyone has a good attitude then I don't mind. The employees make sure to tell you it might take a while and check to see if you're good. When I ordered over the phone to pick up and got there the pizza took a while to come out. But again the guy at the bar (wish I could remember his name) kept apologizing and reassuring me, which I think was really nice of him since a lot of restaurants simply ignore you until they have to hand you the food.

    "text": "Food is good but the service is horrible!  Took more than 10 min for our server to greet us.  Order drinks.  Wine was horrible.  Asked for a different type. Took forever to get it. The waitress said it took so long because she wanted to make sure the manager approved taking the other glass off our bill (which she did not remove). Three of the four meals arrived together. Fourth one came out after everyone else finished. As soon as the last meal was brought out the check was dropped on us.  We wanted to enjoy the afternoon and order another glass of wine after we finished (and after the check was dropped).  When we ordered it took quite some time for the waitress to come back at which point she declared there was no more wine.  What restaurant runs out of wine at 4:30 on a Friday of a holiday weekend?!?",

I've placed an order at 6:30 pm for a 7:45 pm pick up and they called me to let me know that the order was going to be late. I came in and told them that was okay, and I offer as an alternative to come in and eat there instead of taking out, they said that was okay. I went home to pick up my son and came back to be seated to eat there and they said, they were sorry, but that they usually don't allow people whom order to go, to switch and eat their order in the restaurant instead. Of course, this was the answer I've got, after waiting for 25 minutes insight the restaurant.  I ended up leaving with no pizza, no apologies, no option to speak with their manager, nothing. Totally unacceptable customer experience.",

They have had staff come in early to get my orders done in time. And Jamie even went as far as to call in an employee who had the day off in order to deliver a order I had had forgotten about when I was out of town. That is the standard of customer service needed to have a competitive business in today's market place! And besides THE PIZZA IS AMAZING. Seriously. I have an edge over my competition because I am know as \"the company that brings Mellow\". Also a great place drop in for a beer and a healthy slice at lunch! Thanks Jamie and staff!",

You have to wait 10 minutes just for someone to show up in the front to seat you. Then, you'll wait a good 30 minutes just for a waiter or waitress to take your order. Then, you have to wait 45 minutes to an hour for your food to come out.  I was there today and the waitress said \"we have a lot of parties so it may be a little slow for the pizza to come out.\" I appreciated her telling us that but it was AFTER we ordered (should have told us before we even sat down). Also, you're located right next to communities and office buildings; you should know that you're going to be crowded all the time. If you can't keep up with it, then the restaurants deserves to close down.  I overheard the manager talking to another unhappy customer and was saying \"this is not normal for us.\" Interesting because, as I said, every single time I have come here, it's been slow.",

The table behind us seemed to be regulars and that to me shows the ambiance was good.  Want my food suggestion? You absolutely need to try the red skin potato pie.

It came with huge pieces of chicken yummy sauteed onions and lots if cheese !!! What more could you ask for?   There are plenty of other options for me to try and I look forward to that but this one is going in my favorites list!  YUM!!!",

    "text": "My coworker and I decided to try something new for lunch today and we ended up here.  Since I've been to the other Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn, this one had to live up to the expectations from that one.  The atmosphere was interesting.  There's a big mushroom light with booths underneath.  That's where we were seated.  There are mushroom characters around the restaurant.  The walls are bright and contrast nicely with the lighting.  The bar layout is interesting - circular with the alcohol on circular shelves in the middle.  There is a 2nd floor to this restaurant with a few more tables.  The restaurant is much larger than the Selwyn location and has a large outdoor patio.    Food-wise, the menu is the same as the other location.  You have pizza, sandwiches, calzones and a few other options.  The best thing here is the pizza.  The dough is out of this world and sort of like a pretzel dough.  It doesn't just lay in your stomach after your meal either which is a nice thing.  Now for specifics...I ordered a custom pizza with jerk chicken, roma tomatoes, black olives, red sauce and mozzarella.  The jerk chicken overwhelmed the pizza.  It was covered in with it which I guess was to cover up the fact that there is apparently a shortage of roma tomatoes (4 slices) and black olives (I only saw one slice).  Service was good even though we caught them at the tail end of the lunch shift and our original server got called to other duties and another server filled in for a while.  I find this restaurant to be kind of sterile.  The mood that I'm used to with Mellow Mushrooms just isn't there.  But then again, this is Ballantyne.  You'd expect you could still find a little bit of funk in Ballantyne...",

    "text": "I have been waiting since Monday for the big opening, and finally made it over for lunch today.  They finally got their liquor license approved, so the taps will be flowing soon.    In terms of the space, they did a nice job renovating what used to be Table Restaurant . The decor is funky and open and fun with a ginormous mushroom in the middle of the room.     Since I was stopping in for a quick bite alone, I opted to eat at the bar.  I wanted  to order a slice (which was listed on the menu) and a small side salad, but they don't have the slices available yet. Major disappointment since I didn't want to order a 10 inch pizza.    So, I ended up getting a hogie instead. I had the jerk chicken, which is my favorite topping (along with pineapple) on pizza at MM. The jerk chicken hogie comes with pineapple, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach and I had them hold the mayo & onions.  The hogie was pretty good, except for the fact that my whole wheat bread was somewhat soggy.    When I got my tab, I was suprised to see that they charged $2.25 for a glass of soda water.  Wow, that's quite a mark up for carbonated water. (The girl who rang it up couldn't find soda water listed on the POS system, so she just entered it as a sprite... not what I would have expected, but oh well... next time I'll get a different beverage instead.)   There were tons of employees milling around, but they seemed to be unfocused and a little unsure of themselves. I'll give them a break though since they just opened.  I think once they iron out the opening issues, I do expect that they will improve tremendously. I'll definitely be going back to check on their progress and sink my teeth into one of their delicious pies!",
