    "text": "This establishment is the best representation of meh in the physical form...  We came here because we were in the area with some friends and they suggested it...  I will never listen to them again... Okay, maybe it wasn't THAT bad, but it definitely wasn't good...   First off, I ordered a small house salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing and a half order of the BBQ chicken flatbread and the boyfriend ordered an 8 piece wing basket... I get my salad and the dressing is possibly the worst I've ever encountered, but I tried to fight through it... By the time the waitress came by again to check on us, I was just over the salad and ready for my meal, so I let it slide... They brought out the rest of the food... Apparently a wing flew out of the boyfriend's basket on the way to our table... They gave us the funny face when we brought it up and then stood next to him to count them out as if he couldn't count all the way up to 7... Not to mention, the loaded baked potato he ordered was only half cocked because there was no bacon anywhere on it... Okaaaay... Meanwhile, I'm still sitting there with a picked over salad, unappetizing dressing with no flatbread... Finally, the manager comes out and says that someone dropped my food and they'll have it out in two minutes...   Thirty minutes later, the rest of my party is finished with their food and I'm just sitting there with my empty beer glass (all of ours had been that way for quite a while, mind you... Does this HT not believe in refills?)... I called the manager back over and had to request that they box up my flatbread to go because the rest of my party was finished and asked to have it removed from my bill... I don't do that often because I understand that things happen, but I usually never have to ask because the manager offers some sort of concession when screw-ups occur... The kicker?  Since I didn't eat it that night, I tried to reheat it the next day... I don't know if it was that bland when I brought it home or if something weird happened after I put it in the oven at home, but it tasted so bad I couldn't even finish it... I'm not saying this is the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant because I'm sure that something has topped this... I AM saying I can't remember anything worse right now... lol  The only reason they get two stars is because two out of the four people at our table didn't have any issues with their meals... Maybe it was just our bad luck that time, but I won't be back to this location...",

Good menu with interesting items to make your own salad, custom sauces for wings, choose your seasonings for a chicken breast sandwich, and not your regular side dishes (tater tots, seasoned broccoli).

They did change the menu recently, I've only had a chance to try a sandwich but it looks like they re-invented their salads.. maybe not for the better.  Most of the servers here are pretty competent and pretty good at keeping your glass refiled and getting your orders correct.

We went on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch. Not crowded at all and we had very good service.  We had the oysters for an appetizer, when i asked what kind our waitress asked 'what do you mean'. It went down hill from there. Turns out they are 'gold band' from the Gulf. They were tasteless and tiny.  The crab dip appetizer was quite good, it comes with toast points and made for a nice starter.  I had the BBQ chicken tacos, you get two and fries on the side. They were quite good and a decent size for two tacos.",

We sat on the patio for a total of 3 hours.  I would estimate we saw our waitress a total of 4 or 5 times (counting her introduction).  We did manage to get a burger and 2 beers.  One member of the party who arrived after the others asked her to come back for a food order - she never did. At the end of the evening we had to track down the manager to ask for our tab.  He generously gave us a 20% discount off our tab.  (In retrospect we should have walked out after waiting an hour with no tab to pay).  I will make it a point not to stop by again.  Too bad.

    "text": "This location of the Hickory Tavern chain is very comfortable compared to other sports bars I've been to, and every time I have come there was a good crowd (which I do want if I watch sports).   The big downside is the food: It is on the high end of what this type of place usually charges, but at the low end quality-wise. The wings tasted of old grease (5.80 for six wings), and someone else in my party said the fish in his tacos tasted very salty (9 dollar range I think). The nachos were soggy and definitely did not taste very fresh (also around 9 dollars). Sandwiches and burgers start at 9 dollars (seems to be the magic number here).   On the upside, this place always has a craft brew special, which cannot be taken for granted at sports bars.   Disclosure: I am not a fan of sports bars in general. I have come here twice specifically for trivia. The trivia is fun, the prizes for the three best teams are 10, 15 and 25 dollars - not generous, but decent enough.",

I went there every Wednesday for months to enjoy the atmosphere of sitting outside on the patio, where I could watch a game on one of the TVs, slurp down the deliciously fresh oysters on the half-shell, sip on a refreshing 20 oz seasonal draft special, and pick an appetizing entre. However, over the last month, the service had steadily gotten worse. It came to a head on our last visit,  when we were seated on the patio, like normal. After 10 minutes, another table was seated. After another five minutes, another table was seated.  At this point, I asked the hostess for a server, and pointed out we'd not seen anyone for fifteen minutes.  After still no service, I went inside and asked the hostess to please send out the manager. The manager finally came out and was very apologetic. I was not really looking for a comp, but I don't know that I really felt they took me seriously. The manager brought out my oysters, and sent us a waitress, who was very nice and also apologetic. I overheard one of the staff say they were really busy inside, so the original outside server was pulled off service to concentrate on patrons inside. I haven't gone back since. I really miss the atmosphere - and the food - but I am not sure if I'll be returning. I don't deserve to be treated like second-rung business, just because it's busier inside. I'd just assume take my business where I am appreciated.",

They also have a large bar area that makes it easy to hang out with friends and still have a good view of the game.   I went this weekend to watch the Panther's game. The place was packed and the energy was high. The food is also pretty good. I like the plain jane wings (aka dry rub) and the Carolina dog, a grilled hotdog toped with chili, coleslaw and mustard. The hotdog is served with your choice of a side, so I got the sweet potato fries. The fries were okay. They were drizzled with honey (which I didn't mind, but I didn't expect). They also weren't hot (they were luke warm at best).  My friend ordered the jerk chicken wings and he really enjoyed them.   I must say that I was impressed with how attentive our waitress was. The place was full and she still took our order quickly, checked on us regularly and did it all with a smile.   Overall, this is a solid spot. They have daily drink specials, good bar food and nice servers. It's a good spot to watch the game.",

First of all they changed the fish tacos. HUGE MISTAKE!! This was our favorite and we ordered it every time. My side (grilled balsamic Brussel sprouts) came out stone cold. My husbands side (broccoli & cheese) came out at the end of the meal. My toddler had pizza and 2 sides. His pizza was like a frozen pizza that was cooked and his was cold.

But yesterday (06/17 -  Fathers Day) outside the party group that i was a part of (20-25 people) it was pretty bone dry.   **** Special Event ****** (Fathers Day) They had a pretty good Fathers Day special (12oz Ribeye, Side Salad, One Side and Cheesecake = 23.99. With a 10.00 gift card to spend on your next visit). However on the regular menu one can get the (12oz Ribeye, 2 sides = 19.99) which suited me fine since i don't eat sweets. But i can't pass up 10.00 gift card.  For the large group the sevice was pretty good. I'll admit even with a small group, you can have the \"why did I come here with these guys\" moment. And I had one of those moments... a few times. But that's not Hickory Taverns fault. (I just need to find better group - church familes). But my kids wanted me to come, so I had no choice, it is Fathers day afterall. (we only get 1 day so, I better not pass it up) LOL!!  The 4 waitress were great. I notice a few times where they seemed overwhelmed but they grinned and handled their business. KUDOS! The manager came out a few times just to check on everyone, that was cool.   The steak... umm umm good. Medium Rare! no problem. Even the \"Side Salad\" was great. No no nooo, not the usual rabbit food. But turkey, bacon, pine nuts, cheese, eggs. I overheard someone saying the Veggie Burger was pretty lip smackin good for the veggie lovers out there!  I'm not on this side much (northeast I suppose) but if i'm around i'd drop by for a drink or 2 or 3. (Sam Adams Summer Ale)  It may be worth a shot to come back and try the \"Bucket of Boat Trash\" (Crab legs, shrimp, Gold Band  Vibrio free premium oysters & 2 sides). That reminds me of \"Bubba Gump\" in Charleston.",

Upon walking in the greet was ok, then we were sat down to wait close to 10 minutes until we had to ask for a waitress. Keep in mind, it was a very slow time there. Barely anyone was there. Then we ordered our drink and food together with the waitress being somewhat nice. Got our food, and it was not great. Got refills and we were still nice and said thank you. No response from the waitress. Finished our food, put our jackets on and pushed our plates to the side. The waitress walked past us about 3 times before coming to acknowledge that we were done. Needless to say,  bad service and ok food. I'm sorry but this is what ruins businesses. Disrespectful workers.",

    "text": "Good Sports Bar...  I've been to this particular Hickory Tavern many times over the past few years.  Highlights: -Diverse menu: They really have just about anything you could want to eat at a sports bar.  Their wings are pretty good.  I like to get them charred for a $1 extra. -Phenomenal screen setup: I've been to many sports bars in and around the Charlotte area, and this particular Hickory Tavern has one of the best television layouts around.  Whether you are sitting at the bar or in the dining room area, you are never far away from a nice, clear, HD, flat-screen to watch the game of your liking.    Lowlights: -Service: The service is hit or miss honestly, and it seems like lately its more miss.  Of course this is my own personal opinion, but I feel like it takes the bar tenders a while to recognize new patrons when they walk up and take a seat.  It seemingly takes forever to get served that first drink, but once you do, you're good to go. -Parking: Due to the other businesses and establishments in this plaza, parking can often be tight, especially when big games or events are going on.    -Price/Specials: To me, their specials aren't really \"special\".  In fact, I would that this place is a bit overpriced as a whole.    All in all, Hick. Tav is a cool sports bar/restaurant.  You can't go wrong with the food here, even though the service is often spotty.  Not worth a drive in you are not in the area, but if you are, its a nice spot to check out.",

We like to linger, take our time, start with a round of drinks. Never made to feel rushed. Food has always been great-fresh, tasty, prepared to order. Fresh tuna is outstanding. Salads are fresh-no old ingredients. The staff, servers, and manager on duty on Saturday night 7/1/17,from 8 pm until midnight were great. Will definitely return.",

Oh wait, I forgot, there is a great kids meal deal, no joke...cheeseburger, which is adult size with a side (sometimes you get 2 sides depending on ur server) for 5.99. Can not beat it!!!  HOWEVER......They dedicate the outsiders enclosed HEATED patio area to smokers, which is so gross (AND THAT'S COMING FROM A SMOKER!!!)  And they prop the front door TO THE INSIDE open for the bar drinkers on the coldest day of the year. This place TOTALLY caters to their bar customers, which is fine bc it is a Tavern....but if that's the case, then make your Tavern bigger, and don't pretend the place is for people with kids and families. I guess just disappointing BC you expect more than what you receive here.  Giving it a 2 BC they do have a good wine selection and potential to make good business with their location if they knew how to manage their floor staff and kitchen, AND JUST CHANGED THE DAMN MENU.   Sad, this one too shall pass.",

The cocktail I ordered was some makers mark combo with a cinnamon stick, with no cinnamon stick.  I asked for the garnish, nope it never, I repeat , never appeared. I ordered a dozen raw oysters and a bowl of the soup of the day.  Dinner finally arrived, but the soup was cold.  I did ask for it to be reheated and it returned exactly the same as the first. Cold.  At last the manager makes an appearance at my table and removed the soup from my bill, gee thanks for not charging me $8.00 for a bowl of cold soup.  Moving along, if mediocrity is your thing - go for it. They did have a lot of TV's",

We advised the hostess and server we were in a hurry and asked if they could get us out in 50 minutes.  They assured us they could.   We ordered 2 salads and two cold sandwiches - (nothing that needed to be cooked awhile).  We waited over 30 minutes for the salad!  When I left after 55 minutes are food STILL wasn't there!   My husband waited for the food - and when the server delivered it his dish was cold as her attitude towards the fact I left. She could have cared less that I left and he had to ask her to box the food up.  She never put plasticware or napkins in the bag. I ordered \"lobster roll\" which was clearly imitation and it was soggy.  My husband had fish tacos which sat under the heat lamp and were chewy and mealy.   The restaurant was not even a quarter full and the wait staff was standing around (well our server had disappeared)  As someone who spent a great deal of their working life in restaurants if you can't deliver on a promise - you should at least let the table know.   Very disappointed and we will not return... I truly wish there was a negative star system not only for the food but for the absolutely horrible service!",

The nachos took forever to come out as I was half done with my drink when they arrived and I was nursing it.  When the nachos finally arrived they had chili and onions on them.  They offered to make new ones but we had waited so long for them we said we were fine and would just pick it off.  The manager came over and said they would make a new set for us.  The second batch came out much quicker, within 5 min.  Then it took forever to get our check.  When it came they rang us up for the full order and not the small.

After a wait of almost 30 minutes the waitress comes over and states they had to redo the wings.  Five minutes later the manager comes over with the gumbo and says here's something to munch on while you wait for the wings (I wanted it to come out WITH the wings).  No real apology was offered just another long wait for wings....and the order was STILL wrong.    We ordered charred wings in two different flavors.  Came out plain and flavorless.  Staff seemed to be irritated when it was brought to their attention.  Manager brought out two bowls of sauce that should have been cooked on the wings and said \"here try this\"!!  I'm not going to go into the fact of having to ask for extra napkins as well as tea refills.  There definitely needs to be some training of staff at this location.

When we got there the area was clean and the tables were set up very nicely.  We ordered chicken quesadilla and pretzel appetizers, and for our entrees we ordered chicken tenders, wings, and grad burgers, all with french fries.  The food was very good and the customer service was excellent!  I gave it a four star because the area smelled of cigarette smoke (the restaurant allows smoking on the deck after 9PM).  Once I spoke with the manager, he opened the drapes to air the area which helped a little.  I considered having the event at the Harris Hickory Tavern but I am happy that we had it at the Mallard location!  I definitely recommend and will return!",

I had booked an event with another location arrived and set up. Just when we were getting ready to start with opening remarks I was pulled to the side and told the section was doubled book and no food ready for my guest because it was for the other party! I had about 40 guest seated and ready to go! I called this location in a frantic panic and completely on 100 trying to keep my composure. The team members at this location set up for our party in the back dining room and the kitchen started cooking food as we were in route to them! The manager Robert went above and beyond for our group. He even went and found a projector so I could show my presentation. The kitchen staff rushed and got the food out to my guest buffet style in a timely manner, the servers were attentive to us even though we just showed up and they had other tables to attend to. My heart and thanks goes out to everyone that worked there last night! They turned an upsetting and disappointing situation from one location to a grade A event at another!",

The wings were okay but way to much sauce. There was extra sauce left on the plate. The wings were fried and sauce was thrown on it. The burger can have some pink, little pink or well done. The burger has too be cooked at 150 degrees. Which means it will be a little pink to done. So the wings were silently warm. The burger was sent back and the fries were cold. The portion of fries were small. And the price for the items are over priced. For example if you want to add a side salad to your meal its a extra $6 dollars. Overall the food was okay.

When we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and offered to sit at a table or a high top. We chose a high top and we sat ourselves. Once we were over here, it took us a while to be helped. One of the servers who has helped me in the past, stopped by to say she would be right with us. Two other servers came to help our table instead. One of the servers was being trained. They asked for our drink order and then when they returned, they took our orders. The trainer server was asked her suggestion between the POW POW Shrimp and the Veggie Flatbread. The server suggested the flatbread because it's a bigger portion. My cousin ordered the flatbread without tomatoes. We also ordered a large crab dip and a small bbq chicken nachos without sour cream. While we waited a different male server would ask us if we were okay periodically. Once our food arrived, we did not see our servers again. The male server continued to offer his assistance. The crab dip was okay today, not great. The big chicken nachos were fine and the veggie flatbread was dry and bland even with the balsamic drizzle. The severs were still not to be found, so my cousin had to find someone else to ask her to find our servers. My cousin asked for them to take the flatbread back and the servers said she needed to get her manager. When the manager came, my cousin explained what was wrong with flatbread. He explained that it is bland without the tomatoes. That is information the servers should know to avoid situations like this. Additionally, she had to ask for more water when they finally approached the table. Once the manager left, the new server who was being trained stopped by to ask if she could clear any of the plates. The server training her seemed to avoid our table. She brought us our bill and then the new server returned the change. No one thanked us for our business. I am not used to having such poor direct service. The indirect servers, I appreciated.",

    "text": "Because we have liked the other Hickory Taverns we took my parents here one night to introduce them to their charred wings. We had never been to this location before, and sorry to say, we weren't impressed. The wings were just okay, didn't really taste anything great like the typical HT wings that we have had before. We also ordered the nachos deluxe and the chips were all soggy. Now I know very well that nachos DO get soggy from all the toppings, but these chips tasted like they were old and had been soggy even before being made into nachos. I also asked our server for some wet wipes and she didn't understand what I wanted. So I told her I wanted wipes to clean our hands and she brings out four wet washcloths for us to clean our hands. WHAT? How does a place that sells wings not carry wet wipes and doesn't have their staff even trained on the concept? It also took them forever to bring the checks and they weren't even busy, only 2 other tables were occupied. Never going back here.",

    "text": "It was my first time visiting and on a Saturday night. It wasn't a lot of people there, but pretty chill. Only reason I give them 3 stars is because where my mom and I chose to sit was at a high table right by the bar and near where the waitresses refill drinks. I felt uncomfortable with ALL of the waitresses just standing there - some on their phones. It had to have been about 6 of them just standing and watching tv. The food was okay - I just choose to build my own salad and boxed some of it to go. The medium wings weren't really as \"medium\". I didn't taste the little hotness that the menu advertised. The sauce was good and wings were crispy, but the chicken itself didn't have much flavor to it. Other than that, we were greeted and acknowledged, so the service itself was cool. The restaurant/atmosphere is more of the football Sunday hangout rather than just a casual night out.",

Since I live close, I've been a few times but alas no more! Every single time I've been, my order has been wrong (how do you mess up a standard menu item with no customization at all?), the wait staff is demeaning / unpleasant, and it takes an unbelievable amount of time to get your food and cash out (even when it's completely empty) (the wait staff usually huddles at the front and chats while you slowly die with your credit card and bill in hand).  I thought it would be a decent place to watch NFL on Sunday's. However, getting a table is like the hunger games and the waitresses don't even clean off the tables between parties. Also, get this- they have a DJ blasting music during commercial breaks. I mean, it's just comically bad.  The only reason I haven't rated this place one star is because I haven't gotten sick from their food.  All we can do is pray that they go out of business and a duckworths takes over.",

It was thick and juicy, not like the typical burger you'll find in a typical restaurant that's flat and loaded with toppings. This was loaded with juicy meat, bacon, a slice of tomato and a surprisingly yummy mac and cheese topping. It was delicious!  Their tater tots were fantastic, too! And not only was the 'Merican Burger fabulous, but Hickory Tavern donates a portion of their 'Merica Burger income to charity. We received attentive, fabulous service from Erin. We will definitely be back again, Hickory Tavern!  Thanks for a delicious meal!",

However, the server had no clue and initially told me they \"weren't doing that\" when I asked for the CLT Burger Week special burger. I had to show her the webpage. She said she had to go and talk to her manager. She was nice and apologetic, but seriously, what the HT? You're sponsoring CBW AND have a featured burger and your staff aren't even aware of your participation?? That warranted the two stars right there.  Other than that, I had come in 30mins before closing (after calling to verify their kitchen would still be open), so I got my burger to go.  It was the 'Merica's Burger and it was actually pretty tasty and worth the stand alone (no side included) price of $6.  But, again, always a big turnoff when a place has a promotion going and their staff are clueless and you have to prove they are actually participating. Honestly, if I hadn't driven out of my way to go there, I would have just left.  Hopefully, management here has educated their staff about CBW after last night.",

Clean tables, attentive staff, good food, not much more I can ask for at 11pm!  Me and a group of 6-7 came in after a long, hard day at a fundraiser event and were seated immediately. Decor and interior is your standard american bar feel with mostly muted colors and plenty of TVs around the bar. Lighting is a bit dim which is perfectly fine with me. Our drinks came quickly and our server was back in a snap to take our orders.  I ordered the marinated skirt steak. I usually order my steaks medium-rare but with skirt being all about the superb flavor rather than tenderness, I went with medium in hopes of getting a nicely browned exterior. When it came out I was very happy with the doneness, exactly what I wanted. Great flavor and good cut, not too fatty and no icky connective tissue. I love being able to clean a plate without leaving behind inedible bits of steak.  My sides were good as well. Yellow rice with beans were cooked nicely and seasoned well. I got an additional side of brussel sprouts which were delicious. Roasting bacon with brussels, mmmm... who'da thought?  It seems like a lot of their negative reviews come at peak time on Sundays around football time. Take it how you'd like, my visit was definitely off-peak, but a good dinner is a good dinner, and a review is a review! This one's in the books as a very nice end to an amazing Saturday. We all would have been happy with just about anything for dinner but I'm glad Hickory Tavern exceeded our expectations.",

    "text": "First review of the year and it ain't good.   The one good thing I can say about this spot is the service is pretty good. It was fairly empty for a Sunday tho. I know the one HT my dude frequented back in the day was pretty crowded on a Sunday. This one, not so much.   Let's get to all the bad... the food and prices. Back in the day, the portion sizes and quality of food wasn't the best, but enough to justify the prices and visiting.   I typically get chicken tenders and fries but I'm on a meat/veg regime, so I ordered the wing entree and some Brussels sprouts. Bad idea.   Lemon pepper wings are CRAZY salty, with barely any lemon flavor. I think 2 out of the few I had, had a hint of lemon. The hot wings are so so. Mine are better. The sauce cups used to be big. Perhaps people were wasting the sauces and to cut down on food costs, they opted for the small ones. Wack! I could barely fit my chicken wing in the cup. Perhaps for fries, the small cups makes sense, but for wings, I think a big cup is best.   That teeny cup of Brussels sprouts you see on my plate was an extra $1.49. Now mind you they didn't even tell me there was an additional cost, only that I could get that as a side with the wing entree. So $12.99 + $1.49 for that... you do the math.   The bacon Brussels sprouts were aight. Very little bacon. The Brussels sprouts had good texture but the flavor was just not hittin it. I want looking for 5 star quality but something a tinge different than what I could make myself for a fraction of the price, considering how many servings my recipe would yield. So not worth the price.   My dude said his tenders and fries are not like they were back in the day. They used to put seasoning salt on the fries. Wasn't on there today, and a couple of parts on a couple of the tenders had woogly breading rather than the crispy breading that made these tenders popular back in the day.   My daughters cheese burger, fries, and large cup of chocolate milk was well worth the $6. Perhaps from now on I'll order her food to go on a night when i don't feel like cooking. That's all the use I have for this place.",

However, just like extra long Ts and the windows phone, that time has come and gone. This trip to Hickory Tavern was depressing. First we love their crab dip. However, their serving size has shrunk. The small is very small. Our server stated that it may be taken off the menu soon, which will be a shame because it is one of their best things. I asked for a sweet Tea, but never got it. My wife asked for floppy chips. They said they would and could, but never did. Both times they tried they were the same crisp level.  One of the other sticking points was they advertised local craft beer specials, but when we asked, we were told that they do not have any specials because they have not decided what should be discounted. I may have given them a pass if the service was just bad but the food and other things were good. However, the combination of bad service, advertising things you don't have, and smaller portions sizes can not be denied. Like I said, it pains me to give such a low score, but it is only fair.",

To be honest, I was very turned off by their 2.5 star rating and poor reviews. I was ready to walk away. Fortunately, my SO convinced me to stay. The place was not busy at all. They have TVs in every angle and they had the Rose Bowl audio playing throughout the restaurant. Same concept as Taco Mac. The hostess was friendly and seated us right away, by the bar. She then told us that our server, Brandon will be taking care of us. Shortly after that, Brandon came up and greeted us. He was great! He was very personable, attentive, and helpful throughout the entire meal. He kept our waters full and checked in on us numerous times.  We started with the (single) pretzel and cheese dip which was a seasonal special, I think, as well as pita and hummus. The pretzel was warm, soft, and adequately salted. I would even go as far as to say it was better than pretzels I've had in NYC and Philly! The hummus and pita were fine. We were not dining at a Mediterranean restaurant so I wasn't expecting amazing. My SO wasn't feeling well, so he decided to stick with the pita and hummus. Hungry, I ordered the Charred wing entree ($16). I was torn between getting medium hot and lemon pepper. Brandon informed me I could get half and half, so I went with that. They turned out just as described - charred. Brandon threw in an extra (medium) sauce on the side. He said sometimes the wings lose their flavor during the grilling process. He was right. I couldn't really taste the sauce on the wings. The other half did not taste as lemon peppery as I would like, but they weren't bad. Maybe next time I'll order the regular wings and not the charred.  Two other members from their staff checked in on us during our meal. The first one was female and the second one was male. We assumed they were both managers. We noticed them checking on other customers as well. The male manager personally informed us that the dessert we ordered (oreo cheesecake) was sold out. He was very apologetic and so was our server, Brandon.  More people came in as the game progressed. By the time we left (during halftime), I would say almost half of the restaurant was occupied. We left pleasantly surprised. We even told the male manager right before leaving how impressed we were with their customer service, especially with Brandon. Decent portions and reasonable prices. We will return!",

We were seated and it took 15 minutes for our server to come to our table. I maybe could understand if the place was packed, but no, only about 10 tables in the whole place were occupied.  Took forever to get another beer for my husband. Pow pow shrimp appetizer was nasty as the shrimp still had the shell on it. How does that even happen? Server was very slow following up with us throughout this meal. Took a long time to get the check.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

So after that initial disappointment, a Coke suited me just fine.   This place has a nice little patio for outdoor eating which we took advantage of so I didn't catch much on the inside. Our server was very friendly and good. The buffalo chicken taco sounded tempting, but I went with some sort of pepper jack burger with fries and left feeling happy with my decision, and typically when I end up ordering a burger, I leave with regret most places. She did bring me a side of hot buffalo sauce as requested that gave the meal a little more flavor.    Decent spot.",

They bring you these Paul Bundy size menu's and there's nothing I want to eat.   Tonight though was another story. They just redid their menu. They have so many new appealing options, like, BYO (build your own) Salads. You can pick your fruit, cheese and meat that best suit you. They also added fish tacos to the menu which I highly recommend. They were excellent. A little pico de gallo, lettuce and grilled Thalia... yummmm. It comes with fries or their homemade chips (killer!) or the vegetable of the day. I had fresh zucchini. My meal was $8.95. I didn't think that was unreasonably priced. They also added several sandwiches to the menu ranging from 8.95 to 10.95.   Our waitress was attentive and was quick to replace my empty little soldiers :) Actually she suggested visiting this place on Exit 28 on Monday night's for their $2 Corona specials. I appreciated the special attention (I always like a deal).   If you have been before and was like me a little skeptical, give them another try. As for the decor.... please people... it's a sports bar. What do you want crystal chandlers and cloth napkins?",

I was really impressed by the atmosphere, and they even had a flat screen in the restroom so you wouldn't miss a moment of the game. The food is incredible, the chicken quesadilla is my FAVORITE menu item! However, the 2 stars are for the service. Upon arrival, my party of three took no time to order; a total of 5 food items and 5 beverages. Our waitress was nice but was very inexperienced and/or had poor training!!! We received our drinks and oysters we ordered as 1 of our 3 appetizers. About 12 minutes later a huge party of about 20 shows up and that's when WE were forgotten! While having great conversation and the game to keep us occupied, 45 minutes had passed and now we were a little pissed because we had received NOTHING else we ordered. The waitress's excuse was the large party (which we figured). She said that their orders had taken over the kitchen. We expressed our understanding but stretched we were there before the crowd and was now growing impatient! After she basically told us she didn't know what she could do, IF she could do anything about it, we asked for the manager. Fortunately the manager expressed her deepest apologies and comped the food we hadn't received which earned the 3rd star! We left later than expected but satisfied!",

This new style (this location) is a move in the right direction.  Decor and layout are pluses, but menu selection and service leave a lot to be desired.  Let me re-emphasize the service.  It is not even close to being good.  I have been in this location three times now.  Only once did we have a server with a personality.  None of the times did the food come out in a realistic time frame. Why oh why do I see cooks in the dining room?  Why did it take 25 minutes to get food on a day when they simply were not busy?  Oh, thats right... the cooks are watching TV in the dining room.  I guess the servers are in the back doing their nails.",

I enter the place and it's Hugh from inside. I get to pick if I want to seat on high tops or on comfy sofa tables. I usually pick a place near the big screen or LCD tv so I can watch the game and not the ladies like couple of friends.   They have good selection of beers and mix drinks. I usually go for draft, I wish they had pitcher price but than again it's better for my belly not to order a pitcher. I like their food but they only have two or three vegetarian items so I do get tired of eating same type of food every weekend.   I like their service, their servers are usually cute and they take good care of you. I think their manager is usually on the floor and always checking with their guest how their experience was at this place.

After placing an order, it took 20 min for the food to arrive. We were never offered water. The sweet tea is not sweet - we had to ask for additional sweetner - they never brought it so we physically went to the server station and got it ourselves. We ordered dessert - took 15 min to arrive (from another server). We asked that person for our check - she said only our assigned server could do that - we had to physically flag her down and she was irritated b/c apparently she on the way to place another table's order (and I guess cannot multi-task). She brought the check and NEVER came back. I waited another 10 min - by this time we had been there 95 min (remember - we did not order drinks, did not order an appetizer - only entrees and a dessert). Finally, all the members of the party (3) rounded up enough cash to just pay the bill and leave b/c I was NOT going to be there until after 10 pm waiting for someone to run a credit card. In retrospect, I should have demanded to see the manager and have him run the card or just got up and left. The food was pretty good but not outstanding by any means. Combined with the TERRIBLE service, I will NOT be returning to this restaurant. From the reviews, slow and poor service is apparently not the exception. I have no idea how this restaurant has managed to stay open all these years - must be people who just want to sit and talk and watch TV and don't mind 2-3 hr waits.",
