It is a butcher shop so everything is take out and the evening I was there I was the only Anglo in the palce, but everybody was helpful and the prepared pork and beef of which I bought a pound of both were excellent. Their queso blanco was also the real thing.",

    "text": "I bookmarked this place after reading all the stellar reviews. I drive down Tryon all the time and could never find this place. Don't look for Las Lupitas; it's easier to see sign outside the store says Carniceria Tortilleria. Went inside to check it out and all I can say is WOW! How did I miss this?  Basically it's a Latino meat market and take out place. I've never been in one before; the counter was loaded with different cuts of meat, all labeled in Spanish. I knew I needed to find the Carnitas and Barbacoa but wasn't sure  how to order as there really isn't a menu per say. Figured I may need to come back with someone in the know...  In the mean time I pursued the soda selection; they had a huge variety of Mexican sodas in funky flavors using real sugar. I tried the lime soda; it had just the right amount of sweetness.  Must have looked totally perplexed, but one of the guys at the counter came up and answered my questions and even gave me a sample of the Barbacoa and Carnitas in a corn tortilla. OMG it was so good! The tortilla was hot and fresh, the  meat perfectly seasoned and tasted amazing. I immediately ordered a half pound of each and 12 of the tortillas. Added a cup of their hottest salsa for $2;  it wasn't that hot but it had a smokey flavor that was addictive. For roughly $13, it was a lot of food! I felt like I had stolen something.  For some odd reason the salsa's were cash only. On everything else you can use a debit card. Not really a problem; just pointing it out.  Super nice staff, fantastic food, ridiculously low prices, what's not to like? Can't wait to come back!",

Tryon, just south of Eastway Dr. this little shop is sort of hard to see from the road, but worth finding.   This is a latino butcher shop, actually more of a deli in this case. Get in line and order up a meat of your choice ( carnitas, barbacoa even beef tongue) and some queso fresco. Last but not least are the fresh made tortillas, if you have never had fresh made tortillas be warned, you will never be able to eat prepackaged ones again. The  difference can best be compared to tasting a slice of white sandwich bread then a slice of fresh baked bread from your favorite bakery. Now here is this best part, this place is cheap... cheap... cheap, meats range from $6.50-$7.50 , tortillas are a $1.00 a pound. This place is addictive... you have been warned",

I walk to the meat case and order a lb each of carnitas and barbacoa meat and two lbs of tortillas. As I waited I saw the employee pull tortillas off a conveyer belt, fresh tortillas?!? Say what?! When he handed me my basket of meats and tortillas, everything was nice and warm. I grabbed some drinks and headed to the register. The nice older women offered me salsas, pico de gallo, and other condiments. Everything ultimately came down to $26 and it fed my party at work, literally. Our favorite meat was the carnitas with salsa verde, mmm. This nice little gem is worth every penny. There was a little language barrier, but they try their best to accommodate.

This place is mostly a market, and is strictly to-go, but they make wonderful food. In addition to carnitas, they also make pollo adobado (chicken) and barbacoa (seasoned beef), and have good chicharrones (pork rinds). All of this is sold by the pound and makes for a fantastic meal. They also make delicious salsas to accompany the carnitas, and have good queso fresco. They also sell beer and soda and raw meats to cook at home. The chorizo seco is well worth trying.  Pro tip: as a rule of thumb, buy as many lbs. of tortillas as you do meat, and half as much of queso fresco.",

    "text": "So I'm going to try to leave the review that this place deserves...For the past several days I've been feigning delicious tacos and was wracking my brain to figure out where the best taco is in Charlotte so I decided to go off the beaten path a bit and find Charlottes best taco.   I pulled in and in the corner next to the check cashing place and pawn shop I see the lettering stuck on the windows listing some of the items you can get here and I knew I must be at the right place. So I walk in and immediately all eyes are on me because of my lost stare and my pale skin. This was my first time and had no idea what or how to order. To the left you see a plethora of special meats and cheeses that are all Latin foods and at the end is where you order whatever it is you want and up on the wall is the 98 sanitation score which was very encouraging.   One gentleman notices I have no idea what I'm doing and calls the English speaking manager over to speak to me. Ray was so welcoming and courteous and when I told him it was my first time he asked what I liked, showed me what they have there and how the corn tortillas are made same day and even let me sample the beef and pork tacos in fresh (still warm) corn tortillas. He let me sample two of the sauces that they make and holy cow the chipotle sauce is out of this world!! You have to try it!   I knew I had found it, the coveted best taco in Charlotte so I went home with a pound of Chicken which is marinated for 24 hours and a pound of beef along with queso fresco, some extremely fresh corn tortillas, and some green sauce. I have nearly eaten all of it in a day and I will be back very soon. If you are a foodie like me and are looking for the BEST TACO IN CHARLOTTE then you must check this place out and pick up some of this deliciousness. If it's your first time and are intimidated by the options or have no idea how or what to order ask for Ray and he will have you leaving educated and enthused to get home to try this stuff. 10/10!! Will be back soon!!",

Fridges full of drinks and a meat case. Few descriptions, a bunch of people working to keep the cases full, one cashier. I ordered 1/2 lb carnitas and 1/2 lb chicken to go. The chicken turned out to be roasted thighs on the bone. Both meats delicious and moist. You cannot beat the prices! $6 a pound for carnitas or chicken. I also got 1lb warm corn tortillas for $1. I also purchased a ripe avocado, a bottle of crema and 2 homemade salsas. Off I went back into the traffic battle zone to head to meet my fiancee for lunch. Everything tasted so well together, flavorful and fresh. I know next time I want pulled pork, I will just come buy it here and to tacos at home. I cannot recommend this place enough. Our impromptu picnic made us feel like we were in Mexico on the beach! Go to Las Lupitas to get something authentic to eat for a change.",

    "text": "Thank you Yelp..because I would probably have never ventured out to visit Las Lupitas if not for the ridiculously high ratings, and I'm glad I did because everything was awesome! They have a display case with a number of raw meats including chorizo fresco, fajita steak, different hams, pork belly and other pork cuts, chicken thighs, and even blood pudding. The end of the display case has a number of Mexican cheeses (oaxica, queso fresco, chihuahua were among some I saw). All of the meats and cheeses seemed to be between $5-8 per pound except the thin fajita steak was $10/lb.  They also have cooked carnitas and barbacoa, and I order a pound of each ($7 for carnitas, $8.50 for barbacoa) The barbacoa was well-seasoned with a good hint of chile and other spices and was pretty tender. The carnitas weren't seasoned as heavily but they were SOO tender. Aside from making tacos, I actually used leftover carnitas for BBQ sandwiches the next day which were also incredible! They also sell tortillas that are literally warm off the tortilla press when you get them for just $1/lb. They had different salsas to choose from as well- salsa verde, one with arbol chiles, pico de gallo, an habanero salsa, and plain red salsa. Each was $2 and they are cash only because the salsas do not have barcodes apparently. I just got the salsa verde, but I wish I had tried more because the salsa verde was incredible! They also sell avocados, Mexican sodas, and beer that I noticed. The service was friendly, everything I got was incredible, and the prices were really cheap for the amount of delicious food you can get.",

Translation: \"Good, Pretty (In this case appealing to the eye), and cheap!\"  These are some of the best tacos you'll have in Charlotte, but all food is to go. Order 1 lb. of meat, either the Carnitas or Barbacoa, 1 lb. of Fresh Cheese, and 1 lb. of tortillas. The tortillas are practically free, $1/lb, and you can see the ladies making them from scratch in the back. When I went they had 3 sauces for sale at the register and I bought the 2 spiciest ones, the spiciest one was way to spicy for my taste and I love spice.   This is a great spot to hit up before a picnic or before having people over for \"make your own taco\" night. Best deal in town!  I am not sure if they speak English or not, but since everything is out for you to see it would be very easy to order by pointing, please do not be intimidated, everyone who works there is SUPER nice.

    "text": "Just moving from Chicago I was fearful that it would be difficult to find authentic tortillas and taquerias.  This authentic whole in the wall should be your first stop when craving fresh made tortillas, salsas, Mexican meats and cheeses.  The Chicharron case is well appointed with standard \"sheets\" of skin and ribbons of my preference Chicharron con Puerco which includes meaty belly portions attached to the skin.  Either is great with some beer or Modelo Chelada (also sold in the case with the best price I have seen in town.)  The deli case has fresh Chorizo and various sausages and fresh cuts.  They offer Cecina which is a very thin cut of beef which I pan fry, chop and serve as taco meat.  It was good but not as flavored as I expected, perhaps a shake of seasoning the next time.  Their Barbacoa and Carnitas were both good if not slightly overpriced.  The Carnitas were a clear favorite for me.  Tortillas are made fresh and in house, amazing and dirt cheap, helping to explain weekend lines out the door which move very quickly.  Oddly, they only serve the Pico de gallo on the weekends and it was some of the best I've ever tasted. The Arbol, Chipotle, and Verde salsas are available at all times and very spicy and delicious.   I also really like the Queso Fresco and Queso Oaxaca \"Mexican cheeses\" are perfect for topping tacos.    If I had one complaint, it's that the men working the meat counter pretend that \"give me a half pound\" isn't something that that understand which means you will likely get 3/4 of a pound or more...  I could be picky but I never want to call attention to myself being the one and only gringo I have ever seen there in more than 5 trips.    They serve bags of sliced limes and cilantro/onion on the weekends at the register, as with some of the salsas, cash only for those particular items.    On most evenings you can purchase Tamales out of a van parked out front doing your part to stimulate the local economy.  All ingredients are purchased onsite in obvious partnership and they are fantastic.    A perfect place to swing by to assist with a quick family meal at home with some assembly required or if you are feeding a crowd for the ballgame on a budget.  The best part is the authenticity and flavor.",

The meats are delicious and decently priced (a pound of Barbacoa and carnitas are about 6 bucks a pound, and they're already cooked and hot). Queso fresco is delicious and the tortillas are hand made and amazing (like $1.50 a pound!)  Don't be intimidated by the language barrier, the manager/owner was very friendly and helped us out greatly. Also the salsas they sell up front are amazing.",

They speak adequate English, and they are friendly, so don't be intimidated. Trust me, it is worth the effort.  The food is superb and inexpensive. The house made tortillas are so cheap, that they're practically free.  They have elephant ear sized chicharrones, and no, I'm not exaggerating their size.   When I come here, I purchase carnitas, barbacoa, queso fresco, tortillas, and salsa.  For $12, or thereabouts, one can make enough food to feed five or six people very well.  Another suggestion is to stop at the nearby Compare supermarket on North Tryon, and purchase at least two or three ripe avocados. I have never found Hass avocados cheaper than at this Compare supermarket. I add sliced avocado and sour cream to the above ingredients, and the carnitas are heavenly.  PS: I take the huge portion of left over tortillas, cut them into quarters, and fry them in peanut oil on the stove top over medium to medium high heat. I sprinkle them with garlic salt as they come out of he oil. I pair the fresh tortilla chips with salsa or guac., or whatever foods that need some added crunch.",

Walking in, my group was immediately offered samples of the meats: shredded pork, beef and many other options.  The free samples came with tortillas and were equivalent to an entire taco.    I plan to go back for the pork, buying in bulk and taking it back to the office.. Plenty of Mexican drinks available to take away from cola to cerveza.  Super cheap.  I left not buying anything more than $5 bucks worth of Cokes since we were looking for a sit down meal, and felt guilty.. The samples were free and they wouldn't take any money for them!",

The employees at the counter were more than accommodating when placing my order, but when we checked out the cashiers left us with a very bitter experience of this restaurant. Not only was I mis-charged on my order, but when I informed the cashier she was very rude and condescending. When I take into consideration that the food taste OK at best, the drive was definitely not worth the horrible customer service that this restaurant provided. The cashier's name was Noelia, and I really wish that she would learn proper customer service!",

    "text": "This place is amazing for picking up supplies for authentic Mexican tacos at home. It can be somewhat intimidating walking in, but go in with a game plan and you'll be fine. First, go to the tortilla counter and let them know how many lbs of tortillas you would like. They are inexpensive so don't worry if you feel like you overdo it. We sometimes pick up extra for making breakfast tacos the following morning. They are made to order and extremely fresh -- they don't keep long like your off the shelf tortillas from a grocery store. I would say 12 hours maximum with proper storage. Next you'll want to pick up your meats. We always do the barbacoa and carnitas -- both are excellent. Beware: they are going to ask you if you want \"meat\" or \"mix\" -- say \"meat\". It's sometimes hard to distinguish between the two with a Spanish accent. You'll also want to ask for queso fesco from the meat counter. Once you have your food, you can head to the counter to check out. There, you'll be able to pick up some salsa. We always get the salsa verde. It definitely has a KICK so if you don't like spicy, maybe grab something more mild. If you do the salsa verde, I would recommend only adding a little bit to your taco until you know you can handle the heat. They also have a nice assortment of beer and drinks. The employees are always extremely nice, helpful, and smiling.   They now accept credit cards so that's great! It used to be cash only.   What to order (app. 4-6 people): 2lbs tortillas 1lb barbacoa  1lb carnitas  1/4-1/3 lb queso fresco  Salsa verde",

Such a great experience buying 0.5 lbs each of fresh made tortillas, barbacoa pulled beef, and carnitas mixtas last night for dinner. We also threw in an avocado, a fresh salsa verde, and a little bag of fresh cilantro and onion. The total came to $15.15!   Definitely a place where you want to at least know your numbers in Spanish, or be willing to hold up a few fingers and look like a classic gringo (they don't mind as long as you don't hold up the line). :)  We loved the barbacoa but the carnitas mixtas were great too. Beware, mixtas is truly mixtas. It will include tongue, belly fat, etc. Beginners may be happier sticking with the chicken (you'll have to de-bone your pieces) and the barbacoa.  The salsa verde was nice and spicy and way too much for the amount of taco fixings we purchased. I can't wait to get home to put it on other things!    Next time we may buy some crumbly and fresh queso fresco too. It looked really good in the case.   There will definitely be a next time. :)",

    "text": "From the minute I opened the door and stepped through Las Lupitas' threshold, I was transported back to Mexico. From the jostle of the crowd at the meat counter to the squeak, squeak, squeak of the tortilla press, Las Lupitas is a little piece of Latin America in Charlotte.   I read up on what to expect (thanks, Yelpers!) before going, and walked in with my order ready. I suggest you do the same as the experience can be a little overwhelming with tortilla orders placed in the back, meat orders along the side, and salsas, cilantro/onion, avocados, limes, etc. all in the front. As others have mentioned, Spanish is absolutely the primary language spoken in the store. Go armed with a few vocabulary words and a sense of humor, and you'll be just fine!   We headed to the back to collect our tortillas first. I started drooling when she handed me a piping hot packet of tortillas -- 1 lb. (una libra in Spanish, FYI) for $1.26. From there, an English speaking employee took pity on us and fetched our 1 lb. of barbecue (barbacoa) and 1 lb. of chicken (pollo). With the meat and tortillas in our basket, we headed to the cash register at the front where we collected cups of salsas... They had 3 types on our visit -- a mild green, a hot orange, and a smoky/hot red -- each one was AMAZING!!   That entire haul cost us just under $25 and has already fed us for 3-meals. We probably have enough left over for one more lunch tomorrow.   I envision A LOT of visits to Las Lupitas in our future!",

The carnitas was ok. Everything else was amazing.   Hint. Brush up on your Spanish. At least in relation to food. Every sign is in Spanish. We were lucky to have a couple of counter staff that helped up.   We hit at just the right time and there were no lines. Right after we ordered about 20 people showed up so be ready for a wait.  Prices are great all that food was $35 and we got 2 meals and a couple of single lunches.",

Other reviewers were spot on... go in and head to the back to get a kilo of fresh tortillas. Then order your meat from the meat counter.  Grab your salsa back at the front when you pay.  Tortillas:  as fresh as you can get... still warm.  Barbacoa:  Delicious!   Super moist and extremely tender... like the most soft and tender roast beef you have ever had. Carnitas:  Awesome!! Moist and tender pulled pork. Salsa verde: Simple and fresh green salsa that's not too spicey.  We ate in our car in the parking lot... it was epic!",

    "text": "Despite that the prices here keep creeping up too often now, the carnitas and homemade fresh  tortillas are by far the best you will find in Charlotte. I really dislike the consistent price increases, but there really are no other options for what this place offers. Plus, the Staff are efficient at their tasks and very friendly. Weekends get crazy busy so be prepared to feel confused with where the ordering lines begins and ends...or getting frustrated  that you keep getting overlooked. If you are looking for the real deal with tortillas and wonderfully marinated pork meat or beef meat, this is the go to place in Charlotte.",

    "text": "This place may be a little intimidating at first, but if you read all the Yelp reviews they will guide you through how to navigate the store and score the fixings for killer tacos.   I always describe Las Lupitas as like a Mexican butcher shop. Walk in and go to the back counter. You'll order your tortillas there. These are made right there in house, you actually see a lady in the back making them. You can hear her tortilla press. They are warm and delicious. Fun fact: Catch On Seafood (Plaza Midwood) uses these house made tortillas in their Taco Tuesday kits they do. After that, order your proteins. Everything is delicious- the marinated chicken, carnitas, barbacoa. Don't get thrown off when you order the chicken, it comes as pieces on the bone. You will need to shred it yourself. You can also buy queso fresco here.  At the register, you'll find different types of homemade salsas. I think this used to be a cash only place, but my latest visit here they took a credit card. I went a little overboard this time, but I wanted to feed a lot of people. My order: 1 lb (ish, a little more) marinated chicken, 1 lb barbacoa, 1 lb carnitas, 2 lbs of tortillas, 1/2 lb of queso fresco, and two salsas. Grand total: $38. That's a TON of food for less than $40. This would be a great option for parties or tailgate spreads.   There are also coolers of drinks and other offerings in the store, but for me I'm just here for the taco goodness.",

I actually liked the beef more then the chicken and it was more than the chicken. I spent $20 there for one person I think you should only eat here if you have more than one person eating. Beef is about $9 a pound and Chicken (which you have to ask to be cut up) is $5 per pound. Cilantro was $1 and the salsa are $2 and the tortilla are like $1.50. They give you free limes with your order. Again I recommend people go when they are having a big function not just for there selves or they going to be eating tacos for a couple of days.",

Great selection of quesos, chicharron, select cuts of pork and beef, and wonderful homemade carnitas, barbacoa, and pollo. Tortillas de maiz y salsas varias hechos en casa. The food was phenomenal, and Manuel hooked me up with some additional caldo for the barbacoa. I am giving 4 stars because I need to purchase and try some of their meats and cheeses. So far though, we are on are way to a 5 star review. Stay tuned!",

If you're not into measurements and the specifics of my order, just know it's a lot of food. Enough to feed 2 adults ... Twice.   ...

Pro tip, walk in straight back to the deli counter, order a pound of barbacoa, a pound of carnitas and a pound of tortillas from the lady to the right. Then take all of that up to the front counter, purchase all the salsa you can handle from the lady at the front, pay for everything and go home and go taco crazy! The carnitas and barbacoa are incredibly moist and flavorful, just awesome, would go well in any Mexican dish. You should use the ingredients from here, tell your family you made it all from scratch and you will be a hero! Don't be intimidated by this place, their is always someone in there that speaks English. Plus, they take cards now!",

Walk straight back and order your preferred meat by the pound. Carnitas are popular. Don't ask for a taco, this is not a restaurant.  2. Order tortillas if needed, at the counter attached, from one of the lovely ladies. 3. Turn around towards the exit and pick a preferred drink, if needed. 4. Stop at the counter and order your preferred salsa and cilantro, if preferred. (Limes are included) I plan to repeat this procedure as often as possible. If you're starving, eat in the parking lot of the unassuming strip mall and get ready for a south of the border taste explosion...in the south. I went home and added guacamole to mine.

We didn't know to expect that it's really more like a butcher/deli with no seating than a counter service taco place. But when we walked in we were greeted with big smiles. The butcher counter takes up most of the place and then on the back wall there's an understated menu of pictures of cooked meat which is pollo asado, carnitas, barbacoa beef and maybe 1 other option. You can buy the tortillas and meat by the pound whatever weight you want, so we got 1/2 lb barbacoa and 1/2 lb chicken and 8 tortillas, a Sprite and some Arbol salsa all for $13. Who cares if we have to eat in our car for that?!   So we unwrapped our goodies and the pollo was fall off the [thigh] bone moist and tender and i pulled it apart and made myself some tacos on the softest, moistest tortilla I've ever had (and I've had a lot of tortillas). Forget ever buying another store-bought packaged tortilla. It is totally worth going to this Tortilleria. They are so light and fluffy it's like you're on a cloud. The arbol salsa was perfect with the chicken. Hubs loved the barbacoa too and was psyched to go back and try the carnitas.   I am very excited to find this place and look forward to going again especially when the ridiculous construction along N Tryon lets up.",
