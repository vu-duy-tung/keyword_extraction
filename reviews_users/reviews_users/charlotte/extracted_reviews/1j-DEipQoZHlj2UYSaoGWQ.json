Everything we tasted was great, and he even gave us a sample of the jerk pork chop (outstanding) and mentioned some future menu items they were considering. Portions were well sized and prices were very reasonable. Great find.",

I had the lunch special (1 meat, 2 sides) and chose the meatloaf with collards and mac & cheese. I also got the jalapeno corn bread and sweet tea. For the price ($6.99 I believe) the portions were big. The meatloaf was tender and delicious. The mac & cheese and collards were equally as tasty. I'm always skeptical of corn bread at restaurants because most aren't good, however, to my surprise the jalapeno corn bread was moist, sweet, with a little spice. We also tried the homemade hot sauces which were good. I would recommend Soul Central to anyone and will be returning.",

They also wanted lunch special prices but it was clearly after 3pm.  People in this industry work hard and have to earn a living.  The prices are fair and I consider it a good value.  I had mashed potatoes, meatloaf and mac and cheese and it came with cornbread and a drink.  The cornbread was a little sweet but I liked it.  The mashed potatoes I got without gravy, not bad.  The meatloaf was a little higher ratio of loaf to meat than I prefer. I've had better and certainly worse.  Mac and cheese didn't blow me away.  Food is cafeteria style.  It's sitting there when you walk in and there is nothing to lead you to believe it is either hot or fresh.  My expectations of quality were managed.  Service was very good.  They were patient with the two if front of me and were able to serve (fix my plate) quickly.  Would I return? Sure. It's affordable and there's lots to offer that I did not try. It's also in my hood.  Have I returned? Not  yet.",

Was disappointed but I told him to get me the fried chicken and meatloaf. The chicken was really good but the meatloaf was just ok. I also tried the Mac and cheese, and the dressing. The Mac and cheese was pretty good but the dressing wasn't that good. Wanted to try the dirty rice but they were out of that too. My meal came with cornbread which was ok but I'm not really a cornbread gal. (I prefer rolls). Overall, some of the food was good, some not so much. I'll try again on another Wednesday, maybe they won't be out of the pot roast. Still in search of a soul food restaurant that wows me.",

My girlfriend and I stopped by for a late lunch this past Saturday and really enjoyed everything we ordered (ox tails, green beans, collard greens, roti, jalapeno cornbread, and banana pudding).  The food was well seasoned and the menu offers a lot of variety for everyone to enjoy.  This business is run by family and close friends and we were fortunate enough to meet the co-owner, his wife, and son who were all on site that day.  We all sat, talked, and laughed.  It was a pleasure meeting them.  Business was steady and the family greeted every customer with smiles and hellos as they came and went.  The entire staff was very friendly.  Everything looked delicious and we'll definitely return soon to try more items from the menu.  Be sure to support your local businesses, especially Soul Central.  Shout out to JoeDaBro.  Keep making those hits!  And most importantly, obey your parents.  Clif",

The owners and cook are extremely sweet and rightfully proud of their business. We had chicken (baked and fried- both fantastic), sweet potatoes, green beans, collards (I'm normally not into them, but love them here), mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and some serious cornbread, with or without jalapenos. We also had the Saturday special: Trinidadian chicken curry (bones in the mix- watch out!) and the curried garbanzo beans. Excellent- and they will be doing oxtail every other Saturday.  Show them some love- they are a great addition to our neighborhood.",

I love when the cheese is crispy at the top and still ooey-gooey. The yams were ok, seemed like there was something missing. The cabbage was horrible! There's noooo seasoning used whatsoever. I ate one bite and wanted to spit it out. Not what I was expecting at all! But the sweet potato pie was delicious! I would order again - probably double mac and cheese though!",

I had the meatloaf twice and loved it!  It's even better the next day for leftovers!!!  I also enjoyed the mac & cheese, cabbage, black eyed peas, curry potatoes (Sat only) and candied yams.  You get a meat and two sides, plus cornbread for $9.  Try the jalapeno cornbread!!! It's beyond delicious.  Check in on YELP for a cool, satisfying sweet tea.  P.S. The veggies are not cooked with animal fat",

The chicken was delicious, crisped to perfection. I love the mashed potatoes, they reminded me of steakhouse mashed potatoes. The Macaroni and cheese was delicious but the noodles were a little soft. The cornbread they serve with it, was sweet as cake. I liked it. Overall I was very impressed with the food and everything. The staff was very friendly",

Not quite sure how I feel about the cornbread. It's so extra moist. Kinda tastes like a sweet piece of cake at first bite. It's better than a lot of places. The price was $9.50 but i was only able to eat half the food so I'm saving the rest for later. Nice spot and friendly people. Will come back again.",

If you're feeling adventurous, then try the jalapeno cornbread over the regular. Mac n Cheese was my favorite side.  Sweat tea is money!

The food at Soul Central doesn't do that. Seasoning is lacking tremendously. Cabbage seasoning is merely black pepper and red pepper flakes. Collards were bland and tasted as if they were sitting in vinegar to help with the flavor, but the vinegar was overpowering. You know great collards from first bite and these weren't it.  Staff is not attentive. Fried items are cooked per order, which is great; however, if you're going to do so please for goodness sake watch the fryer. My fried chicken (white meat) was over cooked. The ends were burnt and not chewable. Overall the food was underwhelming. Mac and cheese is good and the Arnold Palmer drink is good (if it's mixed/proportioned well). If you like soul food imitators that capitalize off the words \"soul food\" but fail to deliver soul food cuisine this is the place for you.",

I'll admit that the outside doesn't look all that inviting. Just a small storefront in a strip mall. But we decided to give it a try and we were blown away by how good the food was. We both had the pot roast with mashed potatoes and gravy. I had the collards and she had the string beans. For desert I had the peach cobbler and she had the banana pudding. Every item was fantastic. When the owner came over to check on us I told him that I was amazed that he could make EVERY ITEM taste so good. So he gave us a little history on his cooking and where he learned to cook so well.   All in all, a very friendly group of people that cook the best food I have eaten in a long time. I don't get to Charlotte very often but I will make it a point to eat at Soul Central the next time I am there. My only regret is that I was there for only one night. I would have loved to sample some of their other menu items.",

Everything I've tried, I've LOVED - the fried chicken, baked chicken, meatloaf, and pot roast. My favorite restaurant mashed potatoes I've ever had. Mac and cheese and sweet potatoes are amazing. The greens are fantastic. Everything is made with love, care and flavor for days. Beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes, you name it LOL! And the service is saintly.  I'd give them 10 stars out of 5.

I'm vegetarian so to be able to have a meal that doesn't solely consist of a salad (America diet) is always a treat. Mac & cheese, red potatoes & greens with the moistest cornbread ever hit the spot. Support them as I do believe they are the best soul food restaurant in Charlotte.",

Additionally amazed to find that it is run by Trinidadian people who add that little extra island flavor to the food. Everything I have tried so far was good and as a little bonus you can even get Dahl Puri Roti, if you are from the Caribbean and know what that is, on Saturdays.  You have to try this place at least once but be warned, you may get addicted!",

We got the fried fish, meatloaf, collards, and mac & cheese.  The collards were cooked PERFECTLY.  I'm a big fan of serious Southern collards - should be a little sweet, a little tangy, and most importantly, spicy - and these collards delivered.  I'm usually not a huge fan of meatloaf, but I will definitely be ordering that next go around.  In spite of the major meatloaf plate envy, I enjoyed the fried fish, as well.  Perfectly breaded and fried: not greasy, and not heavy.  The mac & cheese tho???  The BEST I've had in the neighborhood.  This is real mac & cheese, y'all.  The cornbread was fluffy and sweet; the perfect addition to the other elements on our plates.  We finished with the apple cobbler, which had just the right ratio of apples and crust.  Magic.  Even the sweet tea was good.  Will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "On a humbug I figured I'd search for some new spots to eat for lunch and happened upon Soul Central. Now I'm from the South and soul food is a way of life in my family so though I was initially skeptical, I decided to give it a try. According to the owner they've been open about 7 months and have been a hit with the customers.   The Space: Small storefront situated beside a hair salon and convenience store. There's limited seating (3 small tables, 9 chairs and a bench). There's not much for decor but I think they're going for an island theme judging by the Caribbean music playing and the Trinidad and Tobago flag displayed at the front.   The service: I was greeted by a very nice woman who ascertained that I was a new customer and was immediately helpful in my meal choosing. She ensured that all my food was fresh and hot and she even came back to ask if everything was ok. Also, though it's more of a self service spot she didn't charge me for my food until after I ate. Excellent! Also the manager came over and struck up a conversation with me which was nice. She might've sold me on coming back for the Roti and she mentioned they plan to expand the menu to include oxtails soon! The only thing is that the fried chicken took a super long time to come out and by the time it did I was too full to try it while it was still hot.     The food: I was a fatty and ordered Pot Roast AND Fried Chicken since I couldn't choose. For sides I ordered the Mac n cheese and collard greens. Everything was AMAZING. The roast was well seasoned and very tender. The collard greens are vegan so even without meat they were very tasty. I'm just partial to my mama's Mac n cheese and no one will come close to that but it was a basic baked Mac n cheese but good. The cornbread wasn't anything spectacular but it wasn't hard or bland. It kinda tasted like jiffy corn bread. They also have deserts but I was way too full to try any. Maybe next time. BUT THE FRIED CHICKEN THO!!!! Man, listen.    The value: For 10.00 it was a lot of food considering its \"homemade\" and you can spend way more than that at a fast food restaurant.   The experience: I came in after lunch around 2pm and it was empty. I didn't mind it since it's so small. Overall it was good and I felt welcome and attended to without it being overbearing. The chicken was fried fresh which meant I had to wait but also I had fresh hot chicken #catch22 I would definitely return to try more food :)",

When the self-proclaimed meatloaf connoisseur says they have one of the best in town, you've got to go try it.   Is he right? Well, every time I go I tell myself to order a different protein. However, I just keep ordering the meatloaf. I can't seem to quit it. I love the collard greens (so legit) and the mac n cheese. You can get a meal with a main, two sides, cornbread (get the jalapeno), and tea for about $10. Great deal. You can also place a pickup order here on Yelp.   There's a few seats inside, but I recommend getting it to go. I mean, the only thing that makes soul food like this even better is being able to eat it on your couch while wearing sweatpants.",

I expected to be smelling some ham hocks in collards and all I could smell was curry.  Once I got inside though, I realized that this place had a little more diversity than your average soul food spot.  I ordered myself some jerk chicken, green beans, mac and cheese and some jalapeno corn bread.  I ordered some meatloaf and mash potatoes for my cohort.  The jerk chicken certainly didn't blow me away, but everything else was awesome!  Great creamy mac and cheese.  Perfectly cooked green beans.  Plus, that corn bread ain't no joke either.  All that food, plus drinks for under $20.  I will certainly be back.",

The sides were also solid though I only had the mac and chesse and the green beans. The mac and cheese seemed ever so slightly sour, which I had never had before but found quite nice. I threw some of the crispy battery that fell off my fried chicken onto the mac, which was a nice way to add some crunch to it. I also had some meatloaf because why not? I definitely recommend this as well since it is done well though it's not quite as special as the chicken.  Service was nice and prompt though it was empty when I got there so this was easy to do. Portions are generous and the quality of the food really is something I would expect at a higher price point. There is a little seating though it's clearly a carry out place.",

Although they are listed on Yelp as having vegan, vegetarian and Caribbean options, they only had a few vegan items. And if you're looking for Caribbean food this isn't it, oxtails does not constitute Caribbean! Initially, we called ahead to find out about parking an oversized vehicle and was told yes certainly, only to arrive and find all regular sized parking spaces. So we ended up parking a mile and a half away and walking to the restaurant. Once we arrived the establishment wasn't all that clean and the steam table food did not look to be fresh. Upon arrival, we had to wait at the counter, the girl that finally came out seemed to just be getting to work and asked if we had been helped as she was putting her apron on. She then seemed annoyed and clueless when we asked her about the vegan options. Then she disappeared to the back again and never came back. We just decided to leave. When we left there was still two customers waiting at the counter. And another lady left without even ordering. I would not recommend this place to anyone and will never come back.",

Those greens were perfect, not blown apart and overly smokey , they were vegan in fact and no meat eater could say no to their persuasive powers . The mac and cheese, the best I've had in a long time ( sorry aunt  billie) just sung to me with the right Amount to Texas Pete . We ate in silence e because that's what you do when you're in the presence of greatness. Don't forget the real brewed iced tea to wash it all down . On the flight back to California , I thought of the fried chicken and of Soul Central and drifted to sleep. How much you wanna bet I'll be eating there on my next visit?",

I got fried chicken, mac and cheese, cabbage and black eye peas. It came with some cornbread. The first thing I dug into was the peas. Really good taste, almost has a spicy kick, I wish they were cooked longer and were mushy. Everything was superb, the cabbage needs some seasoning, but definitely edible. THE CORNBREAD.......... oh my goodness. It is definitely a treat. I want to tell everyone. I love trying new foods via Postmates, this will definitely be a staple.",

I wish they had dumplings everyday but Wednesday's are enough I suppose.   I also had the meatloaf. The serving was more than expected & the quality of the meatloaf was superb. If you're looking for a home style meatloaf without a bunch of fillers then this is the place to go!!!   Green beans, cabbage, Mac & cheese, yams were l perfect. The sweet tea was exceptionally delicious! The sweet tea is crafted with the perfect amount of sugar!   I've had several folks tell me to try the dressing (stuffing if ur from up North) ~ they haven't had any as of yet but I'm definitely going to give it a try!",

    "text": "Let's see...they've got greens, beans, potatoes, tomatoes, chickens, turkeys - YOU NAME IT! (sorry I had to...)  Seriously though, this place actually delivers on providing delicious and affordable soul food. As mentioned in numerous other reviews, the place is tiny. It's right next door to the ever-popular Three Amigos and just like Three Amigos, the place can fill up quickly depending on the time of day.  Because of aforementioned size, I wouldn't recommend dining in. They have about two tables indoors and two tables outside. However, there's no working A/C. At least there wasn't the day I visited. Take your food to-go and enjoy it all in the comfort of your own surroundings.  I would say come prepared knowing what you'd like but due to the availability of some items, they may sell out early on in the day and not have them refilled as of yet. When I visited around 3/3:30 on a Saturday afternoon, I was told that they were already out of collards (I'm going to place blame on the lunch rush). I placed an order for a side of chicken wings (minimum order of 5 pieces) and flounder fish combo with green beans & mac & cheese as sides.  To note, they bread and fry every piece of fish and chicken fresh to order. That's right, there are no pieces of fried chicken or fish laying around getting cold/hard, which is the norm at other establishments. So be prepared to wait around 10-15ish minutes or so if you didn't call in your order. The time they spend to do that is WELL WORTH IT. When I got home, the chicken was so crispy and juicy. They keep the other sides such as the green beans, mac & cheese, yams, mashed potatoes, pinto beans, etc in the cafeteria-style line up. They also now have macaroni salad. Again, the availability of all is subject to change depending on the time of day.   Don't forget to check in to yelp for a free sweet tea with purchase! They also have lemonade and a soft drink machine. For dessert, there's apple/peach/cherry cobblers, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding - all $2.50/slice.  My only advice? go to Soul Central and order as much food as possible. Enjoy. Repeat.",

I never been here before and I was already eyeing the menu. I saw that some Saturday dishes were right up my alley. I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any curry goat today. Instead of saying no, she replied, \"No, its chicken.\" I replied with saying that I see thats on the menu, I am asking about the Saturday special. She then follows up with saying its rarely offered anymore. Why have it on the menu???  Anyways...I order the oxtails (rice was complimentary), greens, and black eye peas. I show the cashier my yelp check to receive my drink. They let me get lemonade.  Upon arriving home to eat my dinner, I found my meal to be just ok. The oxtails had a twinge of sweetness to them, which Im not used to with that dish. I thought my greens would be the same way but they were not. They were tender, but I cant tell if I taste grit from not washing the greens thoroughly or some type of seasoning. The lemonade didn't have any sweetness to it. It just tasted like lemon water. Glad it was free. And the black eye peas were very salty! I had to take a bite with the rice to mellow it out. I put the food in the fridge. And I wasnt offered or received any bread.  I wanted to really like this place. Maybe I will try something else next time. Maybe...",

Everything was on point especially the corn bread. There were many different choices though. Everything from rice to collard greens. The staff was also very nice and attentive.

I finally was able to confirm it by a photo of the menu on the yelp page.

I don't even like dark meat chicken (I got a thigh) and ate every single bite. The corn bread was fluffy and cake-like. Someone help me out here... They must put yellow cake mix in that batter, right?! The stuffing was a perfect compliment to the chicken. And, the green beans, while paling in comparison to the other items, were still drool-worthy.   Delivery via Postmates was only $3.99 and it arrived quickly (about 30 minutes after I placed the order) and piping hot! This one is going to be a regular lunch-time staple for sure.",

They even let you sample it. I had the curry chicken over rice with Mac and cheese and collard greens. My friends had the fried chicken and the baked chicken. The cornbread was awesome! I highly recommend Soul Central and I'll definitely be back (:",

    "text": "$10.21 gets you: a large slice of meatloaf, a generous serving of both homemade collard greens and mac 'n cheese, a square of cornbread, and a drink - which in my case was iced tea with lemon.   * Meat loaf. 4/5 All meat with no onions or green peppers in the mix. It was topped properly with a thick tomato paste. No catsup was available and fortunately none was needed. I would definitely order this entree again.   * Collard Greens. 4/5 The real deal and not out of a can. I added vinegar, Texas Pete hot sauce, and a little salt. The serving size was extremely generous. There wasn't any meat (fatback) in the collards, which knocked it down a notch. The collards were delicious after I finished doctoring them.   *  Mac 'n Cheese. 3/5 I've had better and I've had far worse. These were not the creamy sauce type of mac 'n cheese, but the thick baked and browned cheese topping variety. I liked them.   * Corn Bread. 5/5 Light, moist, and not too sweet, with the texture of pound cake. My mother would have approved.  * Sweet Iced Tea w/Lemon. 5/5 The sweetness was perfectly balanced. Iced tea is FREE with a dine in meal. There is one free refill as well.   * Service. 5/5 VERY friendly and welcoming. You'll have your food in less than a minute if the line is not out the door.....and that is very likely.   * Cleanliness. 4.75/5 98.0%. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.cdpehs.com%2FNCENVPBL%2FINSPECTION%2FShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx%3FESTABLISHMENT%3D179417%26esttst_cty%3D60&s=4f4b63d40ca32a47c4ef1d3c8660374255f96df2dbefd6857684dd93bae565e9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">public.cdpehs.com/NCENVP...</a>  * Ambience.  If you try to scratch your nose....you'll knock someone else's hat off. This place is tiny inside. There are a total of eighteen seats, including those inside and out. Music will be playing, and if it's a warm day the front door will be open. There is a constant flow of people picking up takeout.   * Parking.  If you intend to dine in get there by 11:30 a.m. or good luck. This restaurant is situated right next to Three Amigos, which is an extremely popular restaurant in its own right. There are some additional parking spaces on the left hand side of this little block of buildings and in the rear.   PRO TIP: Their website has an \"order online\" option which shows what is available on any given day.  I told the friendly owner that I had driven down from Hickory with the sole purpose of trying his soul food. As I was leaving he said, \"please come again, Mr. Hickory.\" I told him that it was worth the drive, and I was rewarded with another huge smile. ;o)  Soul food? Comfort food? Southern cooking? Caribbean island fare? It's all of those things. Soul Central is delicious food served at reasonable prices.",

Like I said,I can go and on.My advice to  you is to go check it out and be welcomed by the friendly staff!!",

    "text": "I noticed that Soul Central thus far as had pretty decent reviews, an clearly it's time for an update. So here's the good, the Great then the ugly..  The Good:  Soul Central has maintained itself as a small community based eating establishment on the Eastside of Charlotte. I noticed it one of the workers head on a soul Central t-shirt and across the back was written \"best soul food in Charlotte\".  The Great: the food that I had at Soul Central was good. BBQ chicken was moist, tender, hot, well seasoned (could have used a little more BBQ sauce) but very flavorful. My macaroni and cheese was superb. My unit of measure of course, is my own simply spectacular Mac and cheese .  The collard greens with simply out of this world.  The Ugly:  The staff of Soul Central is in dire need of training in the areas of customer service, or they might find themselves going the way of many, many other businesses. For the front end Personnel to take an order, and leave the restaurant without filling the customer's orders and leave customers waiting for nearly 15 minutes before they returned is unacceptable.  Then it was quite noticeable that there were some personality issues occurring between front end personnel, most noticeably, that one Spanish speaking lady appeared not to be able to understand English when asked to perform certain tasks by her co-worker. Please note that my arrival at Soul Central was during the lunch hour, and one would suspect that this is their busiest time and I noticed customers that came in after me waiting for 30 to 45 minutes to get the orders filled.",

From day 1, I don't care if you get fried chicken or pot roast or meat loaf, it's fire. The meat and two sides set up is near and dear to my heart. Your portion sizes generous and prices are fair. Now, what could bring down the score of a place with such a strong meat game. Well. . . The sides game is inconsistent. The greens are great. Corn bread is also a good option. Mac and cheese are ok. Mash potatoes and gravy are also just ok. I could list all of their sides with a review, but I won't. All you need to know is greens are a good bet, anything else is meh. I generally reserve 5s for top 10 or 15 spots in area, 4s for great but just outside that number and 3s are for I like it, but I won't go out of my way. That's were this falls now.",

No complaints here the pork chops and mashed potatoes were spot on. The pintos could have been better but not bad.    I am giving the place 5 stars because the food is damn good.    2 tables outside to eat on which I did on this cloudy and cooler day.  It is toasty inside to the point I would not want to eat in there.  Small tables big enough for 2 people to eat comfortably.    I would not recommend for a large group or more than three for 1 table.  I definitely recommend to stop by for damn good food but unless there are 2 or less I would do the take out option.

It was BBQ Ribs and 2 sides today. The system charged me $13.25. $3.50 isn't a lot of money, but morally I don't believe its right to bait and switch on customers. The person there that claimed it be the manager had such a bad attitude with me for questioning the pricing and aggressively swung around the POS screen to me to show me that the system is what it is, and put up a major fuss. I told her that I'm not trying to argue and I'm talking to her as a person, but she continued to yell at me.  Of course, i can't find Soul Central on BBB and the owner was MIA, so here I am.

I ordered the fried chicken after the gentleman working there told us that they drop it fresh when ordered. I went with the yams, collards and jalapeno cornbread. My husband got the fried chicken with black eyed peas, mashed potatoes and gravy and jalapeno cornbread.   We were lucky to snag a spot at a table outside (the inside wasn't air conditioned) and happily waited the 15 minutes for our fresh chicken, which was so good! The item I loved most was the collards. They were so tasty and I literally could've eaten a bowl full of them. My husband raved about all of it and, as a fried chicken lover, deemed it one of the freshest and best he's had at a restaurant. We couldn't finish our meals because they were so filling, which is unfortunate because I had big plans to try one of their desserts.   I'm looking forward to coming back soon and trying the pot roast or chicken and dumplings!",

Today, I Had to complain, I took a friend, who had never been to Soul Central, and because of my prior Ravings about their homemade food, we were both looking forward to our meal but it was pretty much inedible, it was SO salty!  I left my name and number with the lady (16 year old) at the counter asking the owner to please contact me, so I'm hoping I'll be able to update this.  The green beans, cabbage, collard greens and Mac and cheese were so bad, I got one of the ladies working to try it too, she agreed too.  Unfortunately, neither workers were able to refund our meal or make this right (offer another veggie plate or anything).  Also, the \"new\" menu is very confusing. AND, getting rid of the jalapeno corn bread (vs plain, sweet) is a bad move in my opinion, I used to crave it!",

They have a nice selection of menu items and since people seem to always be coming and going they have to keep replenishing the food which means that it's fresh and not sitting around for long.  This time around I had baked chicken with black eyed peas and collard greens (I'd asked if I could have rice with my black eyed peas and I was assured I could, but alas when I got home, no rice. Oh well). My daughter had fried fish. As usual my food was tasty. They had corn bread with jalapeno in it. Since spicy food gives me acid reflux I wish they offered plain cornbread. Maybe they do and were just out. I believe their vegetables are prepared without meat so if you're a vegetarian you'll have options, and they're very flavorful. Certain items here are made to order so be prepared to wait. This place is more suited to take-out orders. Friendly staff, good food, reasonable price. Definitely give Soul Central a try.",

Not sure if I caught them on an off day but the food wasn't what I was expecting. Staff was great and prompt. The place was packed (good sign right?).  I ordered the wings (per some reviews), mac and cheese and cabbage. For my drink, an Arnold Palmer...TASTY! I'm not a fan of \"super sugary\" drinks and this Arnold Palmer was spot on, perfect. You can dine in, if you'd like. The place is pretty small, with 3 tables available. I opted to go home, which wasn't too far.  The chicken, super crispy (win) but lacked flavor. I ended up dousing it with Louisiana hot sauce. The mac and cheese was good and the cabbage was terrible (I hate to type this). It was spicy, from some type of orange pepper that was added to it but it had NO flavor. No salt, no nothing. It ended up in the garbage unfortunately. I should've gotten the greens. It was a toss up when I got to the register and I went with the cabbage.  I really wanted to like this place, based off of the reviews. Will I give it another shot, absolutely! But I won't be driving out of my way to try it again. I hope next time is better.",

My best friend and I decided to go for Charlotte Black Restaurant Week after looking at the menu and seeing not only the large amount of options but the amazing prices. As soon as I walked in and heard the classic slow jams, I knew the food would match the vibe.   It's truly a hole-in-the-wall from the outside in and we were lucky to get there when we did to snag a table. I ended up getting the fried catfish - and let me tell you, if a place doesn't fry to order...run. My sides were mac and cheese and yams which did NOT disappoint. All I needed for the cornbread was some honey butter.   Sadly they were out of the curry chicken, which tells me it must be THAT good. So trust and believe, I'll be back before the month is over.",

    "text": "As I live within walking distance of Soul I dine here at least once or twice a week.  As a result there is no Yelper more qualified to share the heart and soul of Soul Central.  Here's everything you need to know from the Soul to the Central...  Parking:  I guess you could say Soul Central has its own parking lot in a way.  Soul Central is located in the same, bummy-looking plaza as Three Amigos (another local favorite in case you did't know) and as a result parking can often be crowded and a bit tight to say the least.  If there's no parking in the immediate area in front of Soul Central, don't fear there's plenty of parking in the rear.  Food:  Awesome.  Amazing.  Fresh.  Fantastic.  Tasty.  Tender.  Seasoned.  Succulent.   Pick an adjective.  Everything, and I mean absolutely every single food item they serve is on point.  The candied yams are awesome.  The mac-n-cheese is no lie, something I find only on Thanksgiving Day.  The collards - make you just shake your head - YUMMY!  Don't get me started on the wings!  You heard it here first:  THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN WINGS IN CHARLOTTE.   Service:  The service couldn't be more friendly, kind and courteous.  Everyone there is super friendly.  Yes, they can be slow.  This isn't Chipotle, it can take a 10min or longer to get your food, know that going in. Or, save yourself some time, and call-in a pick-up order, and you're good.  Those that know will agree, there simply is no better Soul Food in Charlotte, NC.  I don't care what you call it - soul food, comfort food, grandma's cooking, down-home cooking - its good food.  Sorry Grandma, but this spot has you beat!",

I had the whiting and collards, and the rice and beans. It was delicious! They also make their own hot sauce in house that was glorious.

Think take out with a couple (literally) of tables inside and out.  You start at the 'Order Here' sign and tell them what you want. I had the fried fish, which they fry while you wait AND the vegetable plate.  The black eyed peas and rice were fab!  The cabbage had a nice bite, the mac and cheese damn good.  The curried peas were tasty and the greens were decent being vegan. Portions are very generous.  I'm suggesting that you try his place.

The only complaint is the excessive use of styrofoam and plastic ware, but I guess that's the nature of the take-out beast. I dined inside, and it was pleasant. If the operation was more geared towards dine-in, I'd dock them a star for all the waste. In conclusion, the food was excellent.",

The yelp reviews seemed great but when we actually tasted the food it didn't align with expectations. Meatloaf was okay, greens tasted sweet though. It seems like an effort that wasn't fully compatible with the ingredients. Food was all cooked correctly but tastes where just a little bit off. The banana pudding was just vanilla pudding and soggy vanilla wafers. I recommend baking nilla wafers to dehydrate them before putting in pudding. I guess it's just about what you like but by no means am I saying don't go there. Just be wary of the label as soul food.",
