Huge portions, but almost everything seemed fried and then smothered in salt and vinegar. (I love frying and salt and vinegar, but a little variety would have been great.) The best things were the appetizers, especially baba ghanouj and caramelized cauliflower glazed with (what else?) tons of salt and balsamic vinegar. Nice staff, attractive restaurant, easy parking. If they thought a little more creatively about the food preparation, this place could be terrific. I'd love to give it another chance the next time I'm in town.",

None of us knew it was vegetarian but we all found something we liked. We got hummus and the bruschetta for appetizers and they were VERY good. Lots of flavor for vegetarian food. I got the flat bread pizza and it was so good. I did get a choice of a side and I saw in some of the other reviews someone mentioned they weren't given a choice but we all were, so maybe this is something they added on? overall very good food, and very unique atmosphere. you really relax with how the place was designed with the \"breathing\" walls I like to call them, they have plants in a trough type thing on the walls VERY cool. they serve cucumber water which is SO refreshing. I'd def give this place a try for something different if your tired of the same old burger joints.",

    "text": "I may need to give this restaurant another try!  Shortly after it opened, a young vegetarian friend decided we would eat there.  We arrived some time in the late afternoon.  The door was open, and a tv was on, as if the place was open.  But NO ONE was there!  We walked in and after a few minutes we realized that the place  seemed to be empty!  I became concerned about this because of the door being open, television on,etc.  I was worried that maybe there had been a robbery or that someone was ill or injured.  I actually walked into the back of the restaurant looking for signs of life and calling out.  The place  REALLY was  EMPTY!  I was still concerned because there were computers and potentially other things that could be stolen!  We hung around for a while just to see if anyone would return, and no one did.  Eventually we went into the business next door(some kind of gardening center) and made them aware that this restaurant was\" wide open and empty\" .  They seemed duly unimpressed , and I'm assuming it never got robbed because I didn't hear anything on the news.  I guess I should have notified the police when I found it unattended and empty.    Anyway, I never went back so consequently never tried their food!  I live in that general area, and I think I will make another attempt to eat there.  I hope they are now more safety conscious!",

We got: roasted cauliflower, veggie latkes and the bruschetta for appetizers. Bruschetta was the best of the three followed by the cauliflower and the latkes. The cauliflower came with this pepper pistachio brittle and it was an amazing flavor combination. The pieces of brittle were big though so I had to break them up because I wanted a bit with each bite.   For dinner the boyfriend got the OM burger and I got the indian bread tacos. We were so full that we each only ate a little bit of dinner and took the rest home. Both were awesome at the time and we ate the rest for breakfast today. Still awesome.  Though we were completely stuffed, we got the chocolate coconut cake for dessert. Since the boyfriend is allergic to eggs, vegan desserts are always a toss up but you know what? It was moist, rich and amazing.   We'll be back for brunch soon!",

    "text": "\"Meh\" is the best word to describe this restaurant. Having a good experience there is extremely hit or miss. I've been often enough because it's within walking distance of my house, but I'm sick of giving them my money. Service is slow, even when the place is empty, and most of the meals suffer from a lack of proper seasoning. This is a shame, because they do use quality ingredients, and the location/ambiance of the place is nice. The kale salad is *decent*, as is the veggie burger. Everything else I've ever ordered has been bland, uninspired, and not worth the money. A friend and I ate there today. I realized halfway through the meal that the kitchen staff forgot to put the cashews in my salad that are listed on the menu. The place was nearly empty and our server didn't bother to check on us after serving our meals until we were nearly finished eating. At that point, it wasn't worth my time/energy to complain so we paid and left. My friend and I both agreed that it'd be a waste of appetite and money to return. Good riddance. I'd like to see another veg place move into Plaza-Midwood and give these guys some competition. They need it.",

My husband and I shared the wonton appetizer (because every review said they were good), tomato basil soup, and the Reuben with the potatoes. The wontons definitely didn't disappoint. The flavor of everything was great, just wish there were more than 3! The soup made me so happy inside being the temperature is dropping and the Reuben was very tasty. Their take on the Reuben was different, but if you expand your mind on the possibilities, you will be left pleasantly surprised and satisfied. As far as complaints are concerned, we didn't like the silverware. I know, weird complaint, but they are weighted so if you aren't a heavy gripper, the silverware will flip and turn in your hand. Also, don't cut with your fork. You know what I mean, flipping it to the side and cutting. It hurts. Finally, who doesn't serve a Moscow mule in a Moscow mule cup? Apparently, Fern.",

    "text": "I really really liked this vegan restaurant. They have the best fried Cauliflower Buffalo Ranch appetizer ever!!! If you only want to go for this one dish your visit will be so worth your money and time. It's awesome that their menu is so well done, it has explanations and details of all ingredients, keys for dietary restrictions and even paring options. Make sure if you're gluten free and vegan to specify it, the waiters are super helpful to guide you through choices and accommodate any dish if needed. Their vegan cheeses are so so good!!! Super high quality vegan cheeses. My daughter ordered the Chimichanga and she swears never before tasting such exquisite dish, it's a huge dish and there were no left overs. I loved the Leek Soup with Pumpernickel Toast and the Broccoli Alfredo was delicious (though not sure it was gluten free, so ask ask ask). The only reason I am not giving 5stars is because of their \"dog/animal friendly\" policy. Yes we're vegan, animal lovers, \"equality kingdom\" friendly, but I do not like dog sheds flying around, nor customers seating their dogs on seats where others will eventually sit, nor bringing their huge dogs with drools all around. Above all, this is a restaurant where hygiene, cleanliness and hair free environment should be expected. Despite this all, we were very pleased to see that our waiter washed her hands several times prior touching any of our plates and after petting dogs all around. So if this feedback helps in any way, maybe management can come up with an area for customers to leave there pets. All in all, this place has super great food, the plates are all very well sized which makes prices to be fair and understandable. If you decide to go for a first visit try another day that's not on an early Sunday as their brunch time gets overwhelmingly packed. I highly recommend this place!",

I decided to take her out tonight as a treat to this great little restaurant in a super area of Charlotte for a father - daughter night. As a non-vegan, I was really surprised with all of the food offerings and the fresh taste of everything we had. I had the Chimichanga, a huge burrito that was absolutely fantastic and my daughter had the broccoli alfredo which she raved about. Of course desert was just as super as the rest of the meal.  Caitlyn was our server and was very attentive, fun to talk with and had a lot of great suggestions and conversation.   We will definitely go back for more!",

Hubby loved his sandwich which had a perfect almost buttery crunchy finish and I was really impressed with my flat bread.

Definitely give it a try! We shared the Buffalo Cauliflower to start and Mom got the Chimichanga (OMG, good) and I got the Ramen  (yum!). The restaurant itself is small but comfortable and has a simple, pleasant decor. The kitchen is exposed so you can watch the Chef  in action!

I ordered the squash filets- little disappointed. 5 slices of baked squash over pureed avocado for $17... I wouldn't order it again, it was flavorless.

Overall the flavors are great, but I don't connect with the place. I've always left a little hungry and thought it was a little too expensive. I don't mind spending money on quality food, but don't think you should leave hungry for the amount you spend. So, it's not a place that I'd go regularly. Although, I'm in that area almost daily. Great food, better for lunch than dinner and if you're not a vegetarian, I think you'd be even more disappointed.  My mark for a good vegetarian restaurant is that your meat eater friends love it as well. Sorry, but glad others are liking it.",

I will admit, I do enjoy cow and foul and all the wonderful inventions they come in, but I don't need them, per say, to make a meal complete; I can be quite content with a dinner devoid meat. And we're talking about more than a bowl full of lettuce here.  So with that in mind, enter Fern. What a refreshing addition to the Charlotte culinary scene!   I was apprehensive at first (I have been to some dreadfully boring vegetarian/vegan establishments before), but I am so glad Leanne C. decided to host a get-together here and introduce this great restaurant to us! I enjoyed the more quiet ambiance and the soft earth tones that greet you. The mason jar pendant lighting and the wall of ferns and herbs (real, potted plants residing in pouches against the wall) created the right spark of whimsical fancy. The welcoming, personable staff complete the scene (and can talk about the menu items without sounding laboriously rehearsed).  Continuing with the fresh theme, I love the cucumber-laced water - a favorite I create at home during the summer. On this particular visit I also tried their warm sangria, a dangerously delicious blend of red wine, brandy, spices, and fresh fruit. The Indian tacos are a must-try; I love the bread they use for these! As a main course, I tried the roasted vegetable panini and, again, was thoroughly impressed. The vegetables had a rich, roasted flavor with the slightest hint of char, yet remained firm (I hate floppy vegetables).   I'm not saying I'm swearing off meat or anything, but with flavors like this, I certainly didn't miss it!",

The vibe inside (and on the patio) of Fern is great - a nice, chill and green accompaniment to their menu. Service was on point during my lunch and my server was well educated and happy to lead me through the menu. She also mentioned that she's not a vegetarian and loves the food...and hey, that means a lot to us carnivores. The menu features vegetarian and vegan options with many of the vegetarian items available to be made into a vegan dishes. I can hear all the vegans rejoicing right about...now.   My lunch buddy and I snacked on a few different items...all of which were good to great.   Iced tea: 4/5: I gotta say their regular iced tea (at least during the day I dined here), was orange and ginger! It was super refreshing and delicious.   Indian Tacos: 5/5: Three fry bread \"tacos\" piled high with a hearty mix of beans and squash and topped with lettuce, tomato and sharp cheddar. This dish was bangin' and very filling. Anyone who says veggie or vegan eats can't fill you up, must try this.   Squash blossom hush puppies: 4/5: Holy crap, I actually enjoyed vegan cheese?! Yes, lightly crispified squash blossoms filled with delicious vegan mozzarella with a side of onion \"butter\". I didn't go crazy over the butter but frankly, I don't think they needed them. The order came with three blossoms.   Buddha bowl: 3/5: Rice, a bit of faux cream, vegggies and beans presented beautifully in a bowl. The buddha bowl had potential but it was pretty bland for me. Everything was most certainly fresh, but I was itching for some spice somewhere in this big bowl of eats.   Overall, Fern was really impressive and I think they have a great menu, inspiration and focus. Can't wait to go back and try more!",

Little did we know we'd happen into a restaurant open for just two days!  Had we not read so beforehand, we'd never have known - nothing in our dinner would have belied that fact.  Service was smooth and efficient, servers knew all about the menu, and everyone worked with confidence and pleasure.  We enjoyed our entrees - the Three Sisters Cakes and the mushroom risotto.  Both were hearty and flavorful without being too filling.  We also ordered the Squash Blossom Hush Puppies as a starter and while we enjoyed them, I take issue with the \"hush puppies\" label.  They're really more of a jalapeno popper, with a batter-fried exterior enclosing a creamy vegan cheese and squash bossom.  I'd been hoping for more of a twist on a traditional, cake-y hush puppy.  That issue aside, we were pleased with the whole experience.  The restaurant's decor is both dark and cozy while still fresh and airy.  If we were locals, we'd certainly be back for a nice date-night meal out.  Since we're not, the least I can do is leave a positive review and hope it sends more business their way.",

For dessert, we tried the vegan chocolate cake, which was so good, my parents couldn't believe it was made without dairy!  Go here, bring your friends.

You certainly don't feel like you are off of Central Ave in Charlotte--rather it feels more like a restaurant in Asheville or in Vermont. Very quaint.   I came for lunch and had the Warmed Kale salad with goat cheese cakes, which was really quite delicious and perfect for winter. My lunchmate had the Om Burger which also was good. Her side were the sauteed vegetables (also very good) s which came in a cute little tin.   Less enjoyable was the coconut blueberry cupcake, which was too dense and didn't really taste like coconut. Also, the service was a bit spotty. While we were immediately seated and served quickly, and our water (cucumber-flavored!) glasses never were low, we were a bit annoyed that the server asked to take away our plates a number of times before we were done. Not sure what was going on with that.   The minuses, however, are nothing that would keep me from coming back. Great place.",

    "text": "I would like to give it more stars but I was simply aggravated by the service here that I really don't see myself going back! My sister and I went in a couple of Saturdays ago for lunch and we were seated away from the door they had maybe 6 tables in there so not crazy. We were approached by a server and she got us water, then another server came over to ask if we've heard the specials, then another server came over to see if we had any questions, and then finally another server came over to see if we were ready, all in the meantime i never got my iced tea i ordered but the table next to me did and they ordered it after me. Then i asked for sweetener and that finally came after i asked again for it. WHO IS MY SERVER!!!   I was sooo annoyed at this point so we go to order a few of things that everyone has been yelping about- Squash Blossoms and the Bruscetta the server says oh were out of the squash blossoms-um hi we've had 10 servers and not one of you could tell us the things you were out of....then i order my gnocchi-were out of that too, no apology but yet the server staring at me like what else do you want.   We started off with the Artichoke- lacked so much flavor but we couldn't figure out how because the garlic sauce it was sitting in was good. Then we had the Asparagus Bruscetta- very good and so nice and fresh. We both ended up with the Vegetable Pannini it was ok lacked flavor again and too much bread. So we finish our lunch and i notice the manager fighting with the servers to start cleaning up the dining room and getting it reset- I honestly could not believe this women was serious like take it to the kitchen not in the middle of your dining room!! so unprofessional so its almost like you cant blame the servers because they are being lead by this woman!!   One last thing- this is not the Penguin/Diamond you really cant do the tag team service in a place like this because of your prices and at least at the Diamond they're good servers and aren't so intrusive!! I live in the neighborhood and I cant say that I want to return or recommend anyone to try it. Good concept could be better once you work out the front of the house situation and you will be ten times better!!",

The space is absolutely adorable...an earthy green color covers the walls with an open layout and fresh decor.  The place is small, but didn't feel crowded, just intimate.  The menu consists of small plates, salads, and entrees.  There is plenty of diversity to please veg and meat-eaters alike (they also let you know which dishes are vegan and which can be made so).  See Shauna H.'s description of the food we ate as she was my dinner mate.  The service was attentive and friendly, the food lovely, and the atmosphere charming.  This is definitely a go-to for me from now on.",

My one complaint is the ladies room is shared with the catering business and is quite a far walk - and fairly unsightly walk at that. So maybe it is more like walking into a good friends dining room - who just moved in!     Our service was friendly although a bit spotty toward the end as the night grew busier. We were able to be seated on a Friday night around 7pm without reservations but I suggest having them if you dine later then that as the place definitely fills up.   They  had a lovely list of organic wines - I cannot recall exactly what we had but it was a nice red in the upper 30 range. They have an extensive list of juices that I definitely need to try out next time. The complimentary cucumber infused water is absolutely delicious on its own. We shared some small plates as our meal we had the harvest salad, goat cheese cannelloni, braised artichoke, and the bruschetta du jour. The winner of the night  was the delicious brushetta which was so tasty. I also enjoyed the canneloni - and could tell the pasta was homemade. The only dish  I cannot recommend is the braised artichoke which was overcooked and lacked flavor. The entire meal came to about $80 for two.   I will definitely put this place on my list of local dining spots!",

    "text": "I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I appreciate the gastric desires of all mankind, particularly when it is presented as pleasingly as Fern, Charlotte's newest (and best) vegetarian eatery.  I've recently begun admiring the Something Classic team (the folks behind Halcyon and Something Classic Cafe), but Fern takes it to a new level. Where Halcyon is refined and a bit over-priced, Fern is comfortable, delicious and reasonably priced. I'm not usually one for giving star-breakdowns, but I will since we largely dined on small plates:  Wine (4.5 out of 5) -- Our table of four ordered a bottle of Spanish red, a mixing grape I asked our server to repeat twice and still don't remember the name. (When their website is up, I'll come back and update the review). It was a fiery, delicious red - complex and spicy, which is exactly our taste. And at $30, super well priced.  Three Cheese Plate (5 out of 5) -- Loved it! A smoked goat cheese, brie and cheddar, all local/regionally produced, and served with flatbread crisps that remind me of flats I ate as a child - a perfect accompaniment for the cheese. And that cheddar!? It was really good. I need to learn more about where it came from.  Bruschetta (4.5 out of 5) -- We took David A.'s advice below and gave the bruschetta a try. Out. Of. This. World. I mean, this isn't bruschetta as you've likely ever had it at an Italian restaurant, but it was fresh, chock full of vegetables (heirloom tomato?) and so delicious. I'd have given this 5 stars, but it was maybe one piece too small for our table - we divided two large pieces between the four of us. Really, we should have just gotten two orders - it was that good.  Squash Blossom Hushpuppies (4 out of 5) -- Yum! Really delicious little fried pockets with a butter than definitely worked. Again, because we were sharing across a table of four, I just pined for an extra piece or two so I wouldn't seem so piggish. You get three, and I would have loved 4 or 5.  Indian Tacos (3.5 out of 5) -- I agree with Nicole W. below - these are filling, but they were my least favorite component of the night, though still worthy of 3.5 stars. Spicy and earthy, these tacos are well described - classically Indian flavors and textures. I don't know what I expected - maybe a little lighter or lettuce/tomato based? In any case, my plate was clean when the meal was done, so there ya go.  Service (5 out of 5) -- Our server Susan was great, personable and attentive. She clearly knew her stuff and by the second bottle of wine (yes, we had two) our group was getting a little spirited, and she was great to us. I really appreciate excellent service, and that's what we got. If the food alone wasn't worth the return trip (and it was, believe me), personable staff like her would encourage us to give it another go.   Fern is a welcomed addition to Charlotte's eatery landscape. Don't think vegetarian is your thing? Give it a try anyway - you'll be glad you did.",

The menu, while limited, is what I expected from a restaurant offering fresh items. However, for a not-very-extravagant meal, the price was very steep, so be prepared. I am certainly willing to pay for a hand-made vegan meal, but the price makes this a special event, not a regular go-to spot. The space is unique (e.g. small and weirdly shaped), and fills up quickly, so get there early to get a seat if you want to be inside.",

The service was attentive despite things taking a little longer than preferred to come out from the kitchen.  The menu was awesome! While we didn't order any specialty drinks, there was a diverse selection and they were reasonably priced. They even offered kombucha from Lenny Boy! I did splurge and ordered the cinnamon buns from the brunch menu for the table. Four large buns come out in a cast iron skillet and they are covered with an orange glaze. OMG, worth every single calorie! For my meal I ordered the Mediterranean bowl. I wasn't as thrilled with this as I had hoped to be, but part of that could just be me being picky because the food was perfectly fine. The bowl had quinoa, rice, hummus, and some greek flavored dips, so it was just a lot of mushy foods for my taste. However, the falafel that came on top were pretty much the most flavorful, moist, perfectly cooked falafel that I've ever had. So that was a major plus.  I'm definitely curious to come back and try more things on this menu! Very vegetarian friendly!",

I only wish it came with more of those perfectly crispy and light lavash crackers. The taco flatbread has great layers of flavor: the spice of the salsa verde, the smoky chile flavor in the chorizo style tofu, and the heat from the jalapenos combine to create a finger-lickin-good flatbread!

    "text": "One word. AMAZING. I came in on a Monday night when it wasn't too busy and was told I could sit wherever I liked so I chose to sit at the bar since I was alone and did not want to take up unnecessary seating at tables. My waiter was very attentive. He gave me the menu to look over and there were so many options, but I chose to get the Southern Bowl. And if I could get another one to take home and not feel obese about it, I definitely would. My food came out fairly quickly. The southern bowl has grits, house made Vegan pimento cheese, vegan chicken, cashew hollandaise, pickles, and a vegetable garnish. The bowl was so flavorful and finally gave me that Charleston grits w/ cheese taste I was looking for. I almost couldn't believe it was vegan! This bowl had the best vegan chicken I've ever tasted. Also, the vegan pimento cheese was amazing. I could live w/o the pickles, but they didn't ruin the bowl. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Fern: Flavors of the Garden was one of the most beautiful restaurants I have dined in since my move to the Charlotte area eighteen months ago. The new location has a wall of windows that let in an abundance of natural light, accenting the soft green and white decor. At times I felt transported to a patisserie in the Montmartre neighborhood in Paris, at others it was as if I was in Malibu. No detail was overlooked, from the water glasses to the silverware, and the decor was chic, understated, and cool.  As a vegan partnered with a meat-eater, dining out can be complicated and breakfast is the worst! After investigating several options, we agreed on Fern because its vegetarian and therefore has eggs. When we arrived we were presented with brunch and lunch menus. My partner ordered apple pancakes with a molasses glaze and I ordered tofu breakfast nachos, both from the brunch menu.  Unfortunately for such a beautiful restaurant, we found the food to be rather disappointing. The apple pancakes had a strange texture and a bitter aftertaste, perhaps from improper use of molasses. i was particularly bummed about the tofu breakfast nachos (probably because they were mine!). The tortilla chips were nearly stale, and the tofu had clearly not been pressed. The liquid from the tofu and beans was poured over the tortilla chips, leaving a soggy mess at the bottom. Further, the tofu was bland and the whole dish lacked flavor.  I have hemmed and hawed over whether to give Fern three or four stars. The decor was simply gorgeous, and the natural light would make it a perfect Saturday morning spot for coffee and a crossword. I ultimately decided three stars because the food was lacking in flavor and my Saturday morning fantasy would be disrupted by Fern's glaring lack of an espresso machine. Lattes are THIS girl's best friend.",

I didn't want to give them my CC over the phone so they hung up on me and then blocked my number to call back and try to make the reservation. Taking a CC for a booking is amateur hour stuff. No real restaurant does that and you have way more business than you can take care of so why torture the people who want to eat there and call you? The food is pretty good, but they get lost when they try to make things all \"normal\" like it's food with meat. Frankly, they should focus on making vegetable taste goof vs. the chemical processes crap they are trying to pull off. Overall the food is OK. The buffalo cauliflower is damn good, but it all gets really weird after that.",

Queen's Feast drew us in with the menu lineup for the week and boy, oh boy, was it incredible. Big bonus for several of the items landing on the regular menu, too.   Deconstructed onion soup. Whoa. Great broth, incredible flavor. Savory, a hint of sweet, and the presentation makes it rather fun. The server pours the hot broth over the dry/veg ingredients in the bowl and then mixes all together. The parm crackers served with are wonderful.   My first experience with their \"chicken and waffles\" and I'm a believer. The fried tofu could probably fool firm chicken nugget lovers into thinking it as meat. The waffle and spicy syrup -- magic.   Huge plus for having some leftover 12oz bottles of Highland Cold Mountain. We drained a few, which worked nicely with the meal.   Looking forward to working Fern in more regularly. Next up: Brunch.",

My girlfriend is a self proclaimed \"pescatarian,\" so she was excited to find a menu with so many options for her.  She had a vegetable ramen soup with a that had a great broth.  Not being the most well versed vegetarian, I went with the veggie burger.  It was a well seasoned/marinated tofu patty topped with all the usual suspects.  It was super fresh and tastier than expected.  I added goat cheese that was well worth the $2 up charge and had a side of fingerling potatoes to go with it for additional up charge ($4?).  The potatoes were great, but it would have been nice to get a small side with the burger.  A small pasta or potato salad maybe?  That was my only gripe really.  Paying $15 for a burger and side is pricey.  They had a $3 growler pour from a local brewery, which I took full advantage of.  The food was good, service was attentive and they had a beer special on Friday night.  I will be returning without a doubt.",

Now, we walked in as soon as the doors opened, we we're asked if we had a reservation. We said no, and were told to have a seat. We picked a corner table for two. My boyfriend moved the seat to face me since the seat was next to me. The server said we could not do that because the table behind us would have no space. So he moved the seat back and we asked to sit at another table. Two guys walked in and sat there and one of them moved the chair to face his partner and the server said nothing. Not a big deal, that's why I'm still giving a 5, but seating seemed to be a bit subjective to customers depending on which customers case in. We then were helped by another server. The food definitely makes up for the service at the beginning. Will be back if in the area again.",

    "text": "Update: We went back to Fern this weekend for brunch and it was a beautiful day to sit on their charming patio. The server told us they'd recently changed the menu so we tried something new (vegan Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich) and something we've had once before (vegan Breakfast Nachos). Both were top notch, but the sandwich was the star. It had excellent flavor and a unique take on bacon using coconut flakes. The only thing that was lacking in the meal was the coffee, which is odd because I've had their coffee before and it was great. This time it tasted like cheap Folgers. But it was a minor issue compared to how great everything else was, including the vegan biscuit with house-made blueberry thyme jam.   We enjoyed Fern, especially how cute the interior of the restaurant is. (The photos online don't do it justice.) We stopped in a few weekends ago for Sunday brunch. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, my husband got a tofu skillet and we split cinnamon rolls for dessert. My dish was great and very filling, but my husband was a little disappointed in his skillet. It tasted great but wasn't nearly enough food so I shared half of mine. (He had his heart set on the vegan nachos listed on the online menu but they weren't listed on the menu in-house.) The best part of the meal was the potatoes that I chose as a side for mine. We were both really excited about the vegan cinnamon rolls, but unfortunately, they were a bit lackluster. They were slightly burned (probably shouldn't have been sent out like that) and not at all doughy like a cinnamon roll should be. But overall, we loved the place and will definitely be back next time we are in Charlotte. They also have a beautiful patio that we'd like to try out.",

Several commented that the tofu looked like fish with its crispy breading.  The potatoes needed a smidge more flavor, but a little salt and pepper helped. I am never disappointed when I dine here.  Fern gives it a good go, and they consistently change the menu, becoming all the more creative.   At other restaurants, I have only a choice or two as a vegetarian.

    "text": "After listening to an omnivore rave up and down about this place, we decided to make this our first meal in Charlotte.  Initial impression is that this place is way cute - styled to somehow resemble a cozy little earthy dining room I guess?  Very \"fern-like\" and I think this would be a fantastic date spot.    Sadly they were out of the particular wine we had in mind, bummer!  It being half-off wine night, our server suggested a bottle of something not yet listed.  I can't recall the name, but it wasn't terribly good, sorry to confess.  And I think it was notably pricier than what we originally selected . . .   No big deal because the leeks appetizer ended up being glorious! I was almost sad about the modest sizing of the portion as we hastily gobbled down the leeks pieces drown in various delicious sauces.  My entree, the the BBQ tempeh steak was not very aptly named as the pieces were more like modest tempeh slices.  Seemingly steamed and coated in an more unique BBQ sauce - sweetest, maybe heavy on the fruit content?  It was good, but definitely not the best tempeh I've ever had.  The accompanying green grits and braised greens with sorghum vinaigrette were also nice, but I almost felt like I could have made much tastier versions myself (not that I'm an awesome cook, almost the opposite).  The serving size was ample for a nice and satisfying meal, but I resisted gobbling down everything on my plate because I wanted to imbibe in the hand pies - which we ordered to go, as it was getting super late and we didn't want to be \"those people keeping the restaurant staff from their homes.\"  The hand pies were good, but the candied pistachios were what I was totally in love with.    My companion had the zucchini ramen dish, which he proclaimed was surprisingly tasty.  I think he didn't know what to expect, mostly.  I nibbled a bit at the dried salty seaweed flakes, which are indeed super pungent (as per our server), but quite good.    Since this is like a 3.5 experience, I'll go ahead and 4-star it.  I wouldn't mind trying Fern again, but it didn't quite blow my mind.  I feel like I would have been more enamored with another entree selection.",

When our next course came out the chef tried to take the dish with the remoulade off the table and almost lost a few fingers.   Sweet Potato Reuben (with red cabbage sauerkraut) with Kale Chips: The sandwich was good but a little to salty for my taste...I though it was the sauerkraut but the sweet potatoes needed a dunk in some water too. No biggie. The kale chips were amazing!  200 year old flatbread with Vegan Sausage with Fingerling Potatoes: Hubs ordered this and gave his old lady a bite. It was delicious!! It was a large flatbread too so it could definitely be shared. His fingerling potatoes had the perfect sear on the outside and were awesome!   Here's what topped off the night....DESSERT! We ordered the Vegan Peach Beignets and when I had the first bite, I went off to a land with unicorns and glitter! I think we got 5 or 6 of them so we tried to save them for dessert the following day. Long story short, hubs went to work before I did and I ATE...EVERY...LAST...ONE. I had to drive all the way back to Plaza Midwood from Gastonia to get another order.  Beignets saved my marriage, LOL!! Seriously...check this place out for some really good eatin' ...vegetarian/vegan or not.",

    "text": "I REALLY wish I could give Fern a glowing review, but I just can't .  I'm not a vegan, but I eat vegetarian and vegan food fairly regularly.  My husband and I ate brunch here twice on a friend's recommendation, and I wish we hadn't wasted our time.  The staff and the environment is lovely, and everything on the menu sounds delicious.  Unfortunately, the execution leaves something to be desired.    The best part of my meal (both times!) were the scones and jam.  I've had the chicken and waffles, which most people rave about -- but honestly, it was pretty bad.  The seasoning on the tofu 'chicken' was good, but it had been badly pan fried, and the texture of it just wasn't right. The spelt waffles were the worst part. Not only were they flavorless, but I couldn't even cut it with my KNIFE! So sad, because I was really excited about it.  The Ohm Burger failed to meet expectations as well.  My husbands meal each time was no better, so after this last failed attempt, we decided not to come any more.  The best way to sum it up is this: I feel like the people who have reviewed it at 4 or 5 stars don't know any better.  Real 5 star Vegan cuisine (like what I've had in D.C., NYC, and L.A.) doesn't taste like an \"ok\" alternative compared to the \"real\" thing---- it just tastes amazing. The food here definitely does not fall into that category.    Maybe our experiences were a one-off. But I highly doubt it.  I really wanted to love Fern, but I just can't.",

Cool cucumber water was quickly poured into our glasses - its the little details like this that made our experience fantastic. My partner ordered the taco flatbread. Rojo sauce, soitan chorizo, onion, tomato, jalapeno and   vegan jack (you can order mozzarella instead,too) topped the flatbread. He paired it with crispy fingerling potatoes. Both were phenomenal - I particularly enjoyed the potatoes (it was quite a generous portion, too!) I had the OM burger, a white bean patty topped with smoked tomato, poblano garlic aioli and pickled cucumber between a potato roll (or collard leaf). I paired this with their side salad. Both of my selections were good - nothing to write home about, but enjoyable none the less. I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the tomato. It was mealy. It might be better to try this dish again when tomatoes are in season.  I always like a restaurant that politely slides in the the dessert menu - even though we did not order from it, I always enjoy checking out what their offerings are. I wish we had space to tempt our taste buds! They all looked delicious!",

    "text": "Fern is really a hit or miss sort of restaurant with my recent visit. The interior is still has a very nice and organic vibe. Perfect for taking out a vegetarian date, wait staff don't offer much explanation of the dishes when asked unfortunately which may have caused me to hate the dish I ordered.  I got stuffed peppers which I thought would be pretty big peppers stuffed with the rice and other stuff. Negative, they're tiny very spicy peppers that I could not finish. I also felt like I was eating a burrito bowl at chipotle with no lettuce or beans and mostly rice with a bit of seitan. SUPER BORING and would have turned me off to future visits if it wasn't for our other course!  My friend's dish was a delicious vegan bolognese. The sauce was so savory and warming on the cold rainy night we went! The umami imparted from the tomato sauce permeated the zucchini noodles perfectly while keeping a nice subtle al dente bite to them. I probably would've ordered another one of these dishes if anyone would have checked in during dinner to see if we were enjoying our meal.  Fern you're alright but maybe work on that service a bit okay?",

    "text": "1st customer ever and 1st to review, wow what a privilege.  It was a dark and stormy afternoon when I decided to try this brand new Charlotte restaurant.  A little hungover from the night before, I didn't mind the gloom of the day, but knew I needed some nutrients ASAP.  As soon as you walk in, you know why they call it Fern.  The fern theme covers most of the restaurant and gives it a fresh feel.   A lot of the back wall has them hanging from it.  The lighting was quite intriguing as well.  Mason jars with bulbs inside hanging from the ceiling.  Quaint and homey, but yet still somewhat chic.  I was quickly seated and was told I was their first ever customer(besides soft opening I assume).  I could tell this place was a little different as my water was lightly infused with the freshness of cucumber.  I then took a look at the plentiful but yet rather concise menu.  As soon as I saw it, I knew it was a must.  SQUASH BLOSSOM HUSH PUPPIES!!!  I asked the waitress to leave me to my menu for a minute as I re-hydrated.  There was a diverse juice menu and they had tea with orange that sounded awesome.  That said, the water was just so refreshing that I stuck with that.  An alcohol menu did exist as well with gluten free beers and organic wines, but not what I was looking for on this day.  I ordered the rest of my food while waiting for the appetizer, but we'll get to that in a minute.  OOOOOOH, the squash blossoms!!  3 beautiful corn dog looking pieces of fried goodness .  Crispy exterior, with the best vegan cheese filling I have ever tasted.  The onion butter was sweet and subtle, the perfect accoutrement.  I highly recommend this as a starter.  Can't even really put it into words.  May have to go back soon and try to find the vocabulary to describe them.  I went for the OM burger as I just wasn't really feeling most of the other dishes of the day.  My waitress recommended the quinoa salad as a side and she was right all the way, amazing flavor for such a basic grain.  My cohort for lunch decided the mushroom \"risotto\" would be his dish.  I say \"risotto\" because it was made with farro, not rice.  Its still a risotto, just not quite what you first think.  Both dishes came out relatively quickly.  My burger was about as good as a veggie burger can be.  The chevre on top was definitely worth the extra $2 and made the whole thing so much creamier.  The soft interior of the burger matched with a nice crunchier exterior gave the feeling of a perfectly medium rare burger.  It sat a little heavy on my stomach, but that was kind of expected.  My buddies dish looked well put together.  I only got a bite or 2, but there was a trio of mushrooms, some tofu, and some other odds and ends added to a somewhat creamy farro mix.  The farro was aldente, which is how I assume it was meant to be.  The flavor was awesome, but I give it 4.5 stars on cohesiveness.  It just seemed like it needed to be bound a little better.  Not a complaint, just a personal preference.  All in all, one of the best lunches I've ever had in Charlotte and they're just getting started.  My only complaint would be that my pen kind of exploded in my hand as I signed off on the check.  Might want to splurge a little better than family dollar next time, lol.  This place will be on my list of frequented places from now on, even if its just to get some juice.",

That being said, by suggesting to the wife that we eat at Fern hopefully scored me some brownie points.  The restaurant was not busy on the Saturday night that we were there, maybe vegetarians go to bed early. I chose the eggplant curry because I certainly wanted something flavorful and it delivered. It wasn't too spicy but had a little bite to it. I was not asked about spice level when I ordered. The wife had the mole glazed tempeh. This dish was not conceived with me in mind as those two things are some of my least favorite. Who am I kidding, I hate both mole sauce and tempeh. I did try it however and yeah it's not for me, shocker. Oh I almost forgot the wife wanted to try the cauliflower poutine as an appetizer so we shared it. This dish was definitely poutine inspired, but poutine it was not. Flavor was ok, but whenever the word poutine is used, my picky side comes out. For dessert we shared the peanut butter beignets, which had awesome flavor.   Overall, a good vegetarian experience and prices were decent. I can see some people complaining paying that much for just veggies, but you can't please everybody. I would definitely bring vegetarian friends here.",

    "text": "Here's the thing...Fern does what they do quite well.  They have a great atmosphere that feels fresh and clean, modern and green (literally).  I can certainly appreciate a place that sources from local farmers, cooks \"clean,\" caters to vegan/vegetarian diners, and takes pride in their unique menu options.  Here's my opinion....they have some items that are excellent and well done for the vegan/vegetarian palate but they have other things that won't cut it even for the most adventurous grubber.  Their flatbread was pretty good with seitan and \"cheese.\"  I also liked their potato wedges.  They were basically really thick, hand-cut fries.  The homemade ketchup and hot sauce were kinda nasty and didn't quite do the trick for me.  I also made the mistake of trying (based on the waitress' suggestion) the \"squash fillet.\"  It looked like a piece of salmon that was laid on top of potatoes in a tomato \"Cream\" sauce.  The presentation was lovely but that's about as far as it went..The squash \"fillet\" was basically a hard piece of squash with zero flavor.  It was seriously gross.  I like spaghetti squash, butternut squash, zucchini squash but this fillet o squash that was posing like a salmon...not so much.  I like Fern but I don't love them.  I think Charlotte lacks solid restaurants for people with special or alternative diets and so everyone tends to rave about Fern but truthfully there are a lot of things they could improve upon.  The service is okay but I have been twice now and both times I felt a twinge of pretentiousness upon arrival.  It is almost like you have to prove to the staff and the other diners that you are hipster enough and trendy enough to eat at this exclusive \"club\" of a restaurant.  Lame.  Plus it is SO quiet in there that it is almost awkward.  They may consider playing a little music so you don't feel like you are intruding on someone's dinner party when you enter.  I also found the menu to be quite limiting.  I know they can't offer a diner-sized menu but there really weren't that many options in general and it didn't change much at all from the last time I was there which was over a year ago.  Does Fern stand out as one of the nicer dining option in Charlotte if you are a vegan/vegetarian..YES.  If they get some real competition are they going to be everyone's favorite?  I don't think so.",

On the bright side, the fingerling roasted potatoes were outstanding!  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.    For desert we had the beignet s'mores.  Definitely one of the worst deserts I have ever had.  The beignets were doughy, chewy and flavorless.  There was a garnish of tasteless marshmallow and graham cracker.  Avoid at all costs!  Yuk!",

I got the spaghetti and meatballs every time. The second time it was just blah. Tonight the meatballs came out burned. When I told the server she said \"they are?\" I said yes....not to mention there were obvious burn marks which show in the picture. She said they would remake it for me. A manager brought it out to me but didn't apologize or anything. They were not burned but they tasted like they were. The spaghetti was hot but the meatballs were just lukewarm and tasted nothing like the first time I had them. I'm sad because I live in Plaza Midwood and this place is so convenient.",

    "text": "I feel terrible to be giving Fern only 3 stars because I love everything that it stands for in this city of Bojangles and Cook Out. I love the service and the atmosphere and the general vibe. I love that I can go there with my boyfriend's sister, who is a strict vegetarian, and that she's blown away by the options and variety. So, I love a lot of things about Fern.  I don't love all of the breading. I don't eat gluten and it sucks, especially when you go to a place where gluten-free items are labelled, but somehow that makes it even more painful, because there's a total of about 6 such items...none of which sound terribly appetizing.  Anyway, last night I got the spinach and artichoke risotto, which tasted great, but was not exactly a filling meal. I was hungry about an hour later after eating what was essentially rice and vegetables.  The sangria kicked ass! They have a house-made white sangria that was incredibly refreshing and worthy of at least one star on its own.   It was nice to sit outside, although we had to share a big picnic table with another party (our fault for not making a reservation, I suppose). Service was friendly and quick. Prices were high. 3 of us got a meal and a drink each (no appetizers, no dessert) and it was $77 before tip - yikes.   Sorry, Fern, but I can't say that I'm, personally, in any rush to return. Keep doing your thing, though! You're one of a kind in Charlotte.",

I ate at the counter and ordered the cauliflower buffalo wings and the small cheese plate. The ambience was friendly and the food came quickly. The cauliflower buffalo wings were the best that I have ever had in my life - topped with cut up carrots and celery, such a nice touch! The cheese plate was heavenly, and all three cheeses were dairy free which surprised me - I haven't had great experiences with vegan cheeses but these were all such a pleasant surprise, my favorite of these was the pimento cheese. It was definitely a lot of food for one person so I brought home about half of the cauliflower buffalo wings and ate them later! I would definitely go back to Fern because I want to try everything on the menu.",

Who needs fries when you've got these bite-sized little guys?!  The morning was stressful with challenging meetings and driving around with roads full of yahoos who apparently needed to go back for some remedial coursework in Driver's Ed, but the small space with lots of natural light at Fern helped us relax and go to our happy place. Great service and it was only half full at lunch on a late summer Thursday. I'll definitely be going back to Fern!",

The soup felt decadent, but I knew it wasn't because it was laking in cream. HIGHLY recommend. I asked for a side of goat cheese with it. The waitress came out with the largest side of goat cheese! It was so delicious.   My friend ordered the chimichanga. She really enjoyed it. It was  stuffed with tofu, which I'm allergic to, so I didn't taste it -- but it smelled good!

We ordered cocktails, I had the Garden & Gun and she the Fellini.  Both cocktails were a little sweeter and less complex than I would like (by comparison we went to Soul afterwards where Kenan and Andy wrecked our faces with some delicious whiskey based drinks).  She ordered the Ramen, which came out more like a giant bowl of soup than she was expecting.  I had the Southern-Style Succotash, the Tempeh Steak in this dish was extremely tasty.  The service was great, and we probably should have quizzed out waiter more since I felt like I was ordering dinner on the moon.  All in all, Fern is probably pretty alright if you're sick of eating the one vegan/veggie item other restaurants have.",

We also tried the kombucha from Lenny Boy and an affordable beer ($5). I was full and satiated without hating myself at the end of the meal.

    "text": "I recently tried Fern, Flavors from the Garden, a purely vegetarian restaurant on Central Avenue. My mom was very excited to bring my grandmother here since she keeps Kosher and does not eat meat when she goes out. Fern is owned by the Something Classic / Halcyon folks. Halcyon is on my \"to-try\" list and Something Classic is great for lunch - love their new location on East Blvd. and their awesome take-home products and baked goods. Fern's dining room is fairly small, with plants (including ferns of course!) providing a calming decor. Hanging mason jars add to the homey, farm-inspired ambience.  Our experience with Fern was mixed. We wanted to much to love this place but we ended up leaving feeling disappointed. Of course this is based on one meal and I would like to try more of the menu items offered but first impressions mean a lot. Our party of three tried several things, taking recommendations from our somewhat aloof server.  The highlight for me was the fresh Fern salad with cashews and a delicious herbed vinaigrette. Suggestion: serve some bread on the side. With the addition of avocado and cheese (available to add at additional charge) and some good bread, this would really hit the spot. The roasted cauliflower was my second favorite menu item we tried. The pistachio-pepper brittle added a nice sweet crunch and the squash/sun-dried tomato purees provided additional highlights. You can sense the chef's creativity here, which I appreciate.  The disappointments came with the veggie burger and the eggplant/zucchini parmesan. To me the veggie burger was just not that flavorful. I've had veggie burgers made with nuts that tasted so much better. Also the bun was so huge you could not eat this as a burger. I ended up giving half the bun to my mom (to have with her salad) and cutting the rest with a fork. This could easily be fixed with a smaller bun. The NC Hoop cheddar did add a nice flavor to the burger so if you are not vegan I definitely suggest cheese. The quinoa salad tasted like quinoa with lemon juice to me - the balance of flavors was off.  The eggplant/zucchini parmesan sounded so delicious but there were a couple of problems. First, grandma had a really hard time cutting it up in the bowl it was originally served in. The problem was that the eggplant skin was tough to cut and getting to it in the bowl was difficult. We finally asked the waiter to put the dish on a plate which he hesitated to do because \"it would ruin the presentation\". Well.... since she could not eat it that way I don't think the presentation really mattered anymore! The dish was also underspiced to me and although there was ample cheese it did not seem well incorporated with the dish - either you got a huge chunk of cheese or veggies with tomato sauce.  There are several other menu items I'd like to try at Fern including the beet tagliatelle and the Tribal tacos as well as the arancini. There is really a wide variety here so hopefully next time we will have better luck with the food. In May a Farmer Dinner was offered which sounds fun as well - perhaps they will offer this again soon.",

My boyfriend and I go every weekend and this past Saturday we were just a bit disappointed seeing that they changed the menu and also upped their prices by at least 3 dollars making some items 13 bucks.

The Sangria of the night was tasty, the Budha Bowl special was bland, the beet tagliatelle with figs also bland, the rustic potato dish with veggies...bland, but the veggie burger and appetizer platter was a success!!!   The burger is huge! So share it. The cucumber yogurt sauce, save some of that to put on your burger as well. The hummus, de-lish. Can't remember what else we ordered... but it, too was yummy.

    "text": "A vegan and vegetarian restaurant with the creativity and skill to make meatless dining easy and enjoyable?  Yes, please!  The wife and I dipped in for lunch yesterday and had a great experience, on the whole.  Decor is fittingly \"fresh\" with the live fern wall, mason jar light fixtures, organically shaped silverware and artichoke-shaped salt and pepper shakers on each table.  The space is definitely small, with only one outside picnic table and then a couple rooms inside that feel a bit more like a retail storefront than a space designed for dining.  This is a trend, recently, but it was not a major distraction.  As we were seated and browsed the menu, we were served a very refreshing glass of cucumber water that ended up being my beverage of choice.  There is an entire juice menu, though, that is worth a look and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the finer honey iced tea- enough so that no sweetener was required!  The menu is divided into small bites, sandwiches and mains, but this was somewhat deciding as the \"small bite\" indian tacos I had were plenty for a full meal.  Unwise to this, though, we did start off with a side of the homemade root vegetable chips.  There were freshly fried discs of beets and sweet potato on this day.  Nicely salted and crisp, but a bit on the oily side- like they could have used another minute or two of draining and blotting before heading out in their little flower pot server.    As for the main meal, I found the indian tacos to be tasty and filling, even if taco is a bit of a misnomer.  I had three rounds discus of puffy indian fry bread loaded on top with a nicely-spiced bean and squash chili.  Textures and tastes melded nicely, but there was no way these things fold up taco style.  I ate then more like a tostada.  The wife's panini was also substantial- with thick slices of a multigrain bread and plenty of veggies inside.  The sun dried tomato pesto added a nice flavor to counter the mozzarella cheese.    Certainly the rest of the menu was tempting: the pot pie served with croissant, the om burger, even the buddah bowl all had high potential.  Not to be overlooked, though, was the new dessert menu.  Flourless chocolate cake, coconut cupcake, and an apple crisp all tempted.  Fern is the real deal with the kitchen and the cooks to make some amazing meals.   The menu evinces a dedication to local and seasonal sourcing and there is clearly some creative talent used in bringing these ingredients together to great a plate that is insanely fresh and tasty.  Bravo fern, what a welcome addition to the neighborhood!",

My first experience was dinner on a Thursday night (half price bottle of wine) and brunch on Saturday.  Dinner was amazing and deserves five stars.  My friend and I split the green gazpacho soup (I'm still dreaming about it) and seitan meatballs.  Both of our main courses (Indian Tacos & Laughing Buddha Bowl) were delicious and left us feeling very satisfied.  Overall, I felt the value of the meal was well worth it.  Next, I brought my husband there for brunch.  For the price, I didn't think that the brunch was deserving.  It was good, but I was hoping for something more interesting.   I will definitely be back at Fern, but  just for lunch and dinner.",

Small and cozy, Fern's nature inspired interior was welcoming right off the bat.  Each table was adorned with a little mason jar terrarium and artful silver, making this a really neat date spot.  We started with the Fern Bruschetta, which is the only thing I wouldn't recommend due to the sogginess of the bread.  But their local kombucha followed it up nicely.  The main courses were fantastic.  The Arugula and Smoked Trumpet Mushroom salad was by far the most interesting and enjoyable salad I've yet had.  When I asked the server about the mushrooms, she was very knowledgeable and friendly, and all of the staff seemed to have a genuine interest in the menu items and their ingredients.  The OM Burger, as many others have said, was also delectable.  The crisp, light bun made it for me, and the flavor was great.  I'd definitely recommend Fern, it was perfect for a lunch date and worth every penny.",

The place was pretty empty but the wait staff was extremely on the ball and fast-talking ...listen closely to the menu changes and specials :) Don't worry, they'll repeat for you slow listeners. I was disappointed when I heard the famous squash blossoms weren't available (\"out of season\" ??). The substitute was a purple sweet potato croquette, although I did not try.   After browsing the menu and a few questions for Rach, I went with the OM  burger with goat cheese with quinoa salad. After a few more gulps of cucumber water, my burger arrives on a nice crusty bun. I really! enjoyed this burger, the goat cheese sets it off against that jalapeno mayo. Great recommendation.  The staff and clientele here are super friendly and cool- a group of three joined me mid-bite (I offered *wave over*) after one of them expressed their disappointment with no outside seating available.

Fern is tucked away on the corner of East Blvd and Fountain View Street. The interior gives off a farmhouse-chic vibe, with limited seating. Parties of 4 and up should call ahead as they do take reservations.  For brunch they have $2 Bloody Mary's and $5 mimosas, aww yiss! I suggest the chef's scramble with tofu or if you have a sweet tooth, get the cinnamon rolls. For dinner try the buffalo cauliflower, \"chicken bacon\" ranch sandwich, or chimichanga, and you won't be disappointed. Their tomato bisque soup is also amazing.

My husband and I got the chicken and waffles. Perfect waffle- crunchy outside but soft inside. The mushroom pieces were our favorite as they were so crispy but the other pieces that were tofu were just ok to both of us. I thought it was very flavorful, seasoned well but the soft inside wasnt my favorite. Lastly the crispy potatoes were crispy just as their name suggest and seasoned well.  Great place. Definitely make reservations as we saw so many have to get turned away.",

I was very skeptical about buffalo cauliflower tasting too much like cauliflower, but I assure you, we were both blown away when we bit into it.  The buffalo cauliflower here is AMAZING.  We also ordered a chimichanga and \"chicken\" Parmesan sandwich with fingerling potatoes to share...both were AMAZING. Would highly recommend those items.  I have found my new favorite restaurant.  Honestly amazing food.  Also, our server and the rest of the workers were incredibly friendly!  I would recommend this restaurant to omnivores and vegans alike.",

Fern is small (it has outside seating but it was raining the night of our visit so, it wasn't in use) & a relaxed/welcoming feeling to it. The food was good & the staff friendly. My only disappoint is that the reservation I made wasn't honored. The hostess offered her apologies nevertheless, my party was split up and we dined apart from one another. Now, I must say, that the separation of our party did not in any way distract from the quality of the food we consumed on our visit however, the separation definitely took away from the total dinning experience as some in the party were visiting Charlotte. Fern's staff did absolutely nothing in connection with honoring the reservation other then to break my dining party up. Very disappointing, the 3 stars reflex the lack of professionalism by the front of the house staff.",

If you're a vegetarian, you'll probably love it and think that it's the best thing in the world.  I enjoy the nice patio setting that even though, it's next to a small parking lot and a busy street, it's designed and enclosed in such a way that you don't feel as though you're in that environment.  Do be advised that during spring, a lot of things seem to to be dropping from the trees and the server even warned to sit in a certain outdoor section under a nice tree as it's a \"bird\" zone.  There's a small but diverse selection of craft brews that should at least satisfy most taste buds.  During brunch, as I came for, there's a mimosa option as well.  The menu has all the essentials from pancakes to egg dishes and chicken and bacon substitutes.  I tried the Chick'n Bac'n Ranch sandwich and it was pretty good.  The chicken substitute was nice but the bacon one actually wasn't there now that I think of it, or it was so neutral that I just couldn't tell that there was another flavor there *shrugs*.  The greens and tomato were fresh.  The breakfast potatoes were a stand-out though.  They were quite tasty.  This is a cute restaurant to pop into.  If you live in the area, it's worth a try. I'd come back if I were a local to try other dishes as well.",

Phenomenal doesn't even begin to explain it. The portions are very generous unlike most vegan places so I had left overs. They also had $2 bloody Mary's and $5 mimosas. Can't beat that! Oh my husband had a the \"chicken\" ranch bacon burger and it was so tasty! We both had the tomato bisque on the side which was cashew based and so delicious as well. All in all, it was a 10!

    "text": "Let me just tell you a little story.   This past Saturday, we planned a double date with our friends. They made a 5:15 reservation for all of us. Due to some scheduling conflicts, they arrived at 5:15 and we couldn't get there until 6. In the meantime, they ordered drinks and appetizers. As soon as we arrived, we order more drinks, dinner...everything was great.   Around 7:15, dinner was winding down and we were looking at the dessert menu when a manager came over and informed us we had five more minutes at our table. Apparently, another party of four was there with a reservation so they asked us to leave. We stated we were about to order dessert and he repeated that we would have five more minutes.   I might understand this if we'd been sitting at our table for hours after the plates had been cleared, but this was minutes after we'd finished. Perhaps they were annoyed that part of our party hadn't arrived until 6, but our friends had ordered plenty of food and drinks in the meantime, ensuring they were making money from our table. I don't think it's unreasonable to spend two hours at a nice dinner with friends on a Saturday night. Lingering over a glass of wine and dessert is one of the perks of going out in the first place. There were other four tops that had arrived at the same time as we did that weren't asked to leave.    Needless to say, I won't be back.",

One of my favorite entrees is the grits that are often topped with some assorted veggies, vegan hollandaise sauce, and a vegan protein like tofu or tempeh.

My friend and I shared the red chile tempeh tacos which comes with Indian fry bread and crumbled tempeh. Very good and more than enough for 2 people sharing items. We also had the Moroccan tangine which had a really wonderful orange and cilantro flavor that lingered in your mouth. This dish tastes really good with the toasted pitas they provide although 3 tiny little squares was not enough. We asked for more and scooped up the rest of that lovely dish. Next was the huge bowl of signature ramen. Don't think noodles when you see this on the menu. It's made with zucchini noodles, mushrooms and tofu. They also give you some fried seaweed crumbles to put on top. Very good on a cold night. We also both had freshly made juices that were a nice addition to the meal. For dessert we shared these awesome, warm beignets filled with chocolate that were served in a brown paper bag dusted with lots of powdered sugar. They were accompanied with some raspberry sauce that I ended up licking from the plate. Needless to say, they were yummy! I will be back!",

The Indian Tacos and Beet Tagliatelle are a hands down favorite, and hubby enjoys the Om burger, which is massive! The Buddha Bowl is another go to dish that never fails to impress.   The decor is just plain fun. It is also a great spot to drop in and order a juice from, especially with the lack of raw juice bars in Charlotte.   Despite the absence of a kid's menu, the staff has always been wonderful and kind when we bring our 4 year old daughter along. The soups are delicious, and make the perfect serving size for her dinner.  We have yet to try any of Fern's desserts, but if positive exclamations from nearby tables are any indication, they are delicious indeed. :-)  We have also brought both sets of our parents to eat at Fern. Both my family and his are meat-lovers, and they were pleasantly surprised at how much they enjoyed the vegetarian fare, with compliments rather than complaints.",

My friend is vegan and its tough to find a good place with GOOD food done right. Turns out, this was NOT one of those good places.   It has very nice yet simple decor. The mason jars chandelier was really neat. Even the silverware was cute. I like that lots of the vegetables were from local farms. We are big supporters of farm to table.  Service was good. Our server was very attentive and seem to be very knowledgeable about the menu. However, she spoke very loudly. It was a bit awkward. They were great with refilling our waters, but never asked if we wanted more sangria or another drink. Our mugs were clearly almost empty because we were eating the fruit left in the bottom, with a fork.  We decided to take our servers suggestion and went with the queens feast 4 course menu. My friend asked for the vegan options. Started with cucumber water & warm sangria which was fantastic. It actually was the best part of the meal. The rest of the meal was memorable in the worst sense possible.  First course, winter veg bruschetta top with with. She received her with cheese. So we asked for one without. The bread wasn't toasted very well, so that made it a little hard to eat. Good flavor though. Second course, I had the sweet potato and goat cheese tatin accompanied by a small arugula salad. It was eh..ok.... My friend had the blue corn fritters wit green chili sauce. The fritters was still raw in the middle and had no flavor. The sauce wasn't bad, but it would have been better if it was smooth rather than chunky. Next, I had the whole wheat pasta with house made portobella and seitan sausage with roasted brussle sprouts and topped with parmesan cheese. The pasta was very thick, tough and undercooked. The sausage was dry and flavorless. As if it had been seating under the heat lamp for too long after it was sliced. The Brussels were over cooked and mushy. The cheese was the better part of the dish. The entire dish lacked seasoning. My friend had the veg ragu; kale, mushrooms, potatoes and tempe. Again lacked flavor and was just boring.  Last course, vegan chocolate with rich chocolate sauce and a very unpleasant Orange cream filling. Apple crepes filled with what looked like house made Apple sauce, topped with few berries and whipped cream. I was looking forward to perhaps some sauteed apples or a compote of some sort. Something with texture. The Apple sauce was a terrible decision.   We are not picky eaters. We just know good food when we have it. We both believe that if the dishes were seasoned well and prepared properly, the meal would have great. We will not likely go back.",

    "text": "I love when new and different places open in Charlotte; it validates that we're a young, growing city on the rise.  Fern's decor is just what you'd expect from a vegetarian restaurant: welcoming and earthy, but not overly granola.  I'm sure this statement will come to bite me in the meat-eating rear when I can't flag down a waiter the next time I'm out, but the servers were almost TOO helpful.  We had a few different ones come to our table to introduce themselves, educate us on the juice menu, and just generally welcome us to Fern before we even ordered.  I like an attentive wait staff, but chill out there a bit, peeps.  The place was packed, which is a huge coup for lunch.  Although I easily found something I wanted to order, I wish there'd been more options on the lunch menu.  I previewed the online menu before heading over there, and a few of the key dishes that I was hoping to try are apparently only served at dinner.  That being said, what I had was delicious.  The flavors were like that brooding ex-boyfriend: deep and intense, and I mean that in the best way.  Between my friend and I, we ordered the bruschetta of the day (mushrooms and wonderfulness), the buddha bowl, and the om burger.  The toasted bruschetta bread was simultaneously crunchy and perfectly chewy; we seriously licked the plate clean, fighting over who got the last little bites.  The om burger was richly flavorful and the root  veggie chips were well seasoned, with some crispy and some chewy.  My friend loved her buddha bowl, although I thought it was a bit bland.  The folks from Something Classic have proved their range and skills extend to the meat-free variety.  Well done!",

    "text": "As a manic yet guilty meat-eater, I've been on a 10-year plan to become a vegetarian for about 20 years now.  Haven't made too much progress but Fern gives me hope to \"win the future\" (that's a tag line I came up with recently, Obama stole it).   The roasted vegetable panini was out of this world - eggplant, zucchini, a delicious mozzarella cheese on a soft roll.  It came with a side (I got the quinoa salad) for $9 and it was a huge sandwich.  We also tried the Indian tacos, and as the other reviewers have said, they were great.  Also a huge portion and we had leftovers.  The \"hush puppies\" - we started with these and they were tremendous - melt in your mouth awesomeness. Good beer selection and then they have a whole array of specialty juices.  I guess juicing (legally) is all the rage nowadays.  People spend like $500 on juicers and supposedly after a week of juicing, people who are unhealthy and about to die become health gods.  We didn't try it, but maybe next time. Great location in Plaza Midwood, across the street from Bistro La Bon.  You might need to park in the big lot in front of Family Dollar and cross busy Central Avenue, but it's worth it.  Just don't do it while talking on a cell phone - we saw some girl do this and she dropped her bag and then she almost got hit by a car. Other items that sounded incredible were the bruschetta appetizer and the Buddha bowl.  You'll have to go to Fern to find out what's in it.  Nice people working there - very helpful and attentive.  This place has been open for a few days and they already had a wait on Friday night. Great addition to Charlotte.",

    "text": "I wanted to give it more than 3 stars, perhaps 3.5 or 4 but there were a couple things off with my experience. I'll start with the bad.   My boyfriend and had almost picked out exactly what we were going to get as soon as we got to the restaurant since we had checked out their menu prior to getting there. We got there, however, and they had run out of the hush puppies (app.). The other bad thing was the fact that after we ordered the bruschetta and specifically told the server we needed the vegan option for it she came back with the non-vegan and my boyfriend accidentally ate the cheddar cheese and was like \"Hmm, this tastes way too good, like really sharp!\". I mean it was actually kinda humorous but we let the server know and they brought us back the right one. The second one that came out, however, was kinda soft, not toasted/grilled enough, must've been because they really tried to rush it out in order to not aggravate us further? Anyhow, it wasn't bad, the flavors of it were there, just the texture of the bread was not what we were hoping for. The sweet potatoes gnocchi was definitely not something that stood out for me either. It was mehhh.   Now the good. Their Indian Tacos (app.) were pretty delicious. It was a large portion and I tend to get full easily but I could keep eating like a thousand of those things, okay not really but you know what I mean. The dough on the bottom reminded me of \"Sopaipillas\" which are a typical Chilean snack (which is where I was born). The beer  options were good. My boyfriend and I are obsessed with trying out good beers so that was a plus. Also, very reasonably priced, but I may be biased as we just moved down to Charlotte from NYC. Lastly, their desserts were pretty good, the chocolate cake more so than the beer donuts. The cake was perfectly moist and not too overwhelmingly sweet/rich. Probably due to the balance of the peppermint icing on top. I enjoyed this since I am not really a chocolate lover, at all.  Service was attentive. A little bit nervous and definitely not the most genuine but overall clear and concise. Will definitely give it another go and hope to give it a 4!",

When you first walk in, you immediately spot the mason jar chandelier, and the atmosphere just kind of grabs you....very inviting feel.  We started with the bruschetta, which was pretty good.  I would have like for the bread to be a bit crunchier, but the flavors of the topping were excellent.  My wife ordered the Indian Tacos and said that she really like them and would definitely get them again.  I ordered the Buddha Bowl, which is a conglomeration of the day's fresh vegetables tossed together in a great sauce and spooned over rice and beans.  Very good and hearty dish.  I actually expected to leave this place still hungry, but was totally surprised by the heartiness of the dishes.  Can't wait to go back!  Oh and they also have a great selection of organic wines too!",

The staff was extremely knowledgeable about preparations and available substitutions.  You even have the option of making certain dishes vegan.  The decor of the restaurant was delightful.  It was quaint, sophisticated without being stuffy and very appealing to the eye.  And the food.... ahhh!  We ordered multiple items so we could try a little of everything Chef Alyssa had to offer and each item was delicious.  The flavors were fantastic, the veggies were crisp and paired together beautifully.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.  Carnivore, vegetarian, vegan... you WILL NOT be disappointed.",

For my main course I got the Mushroom Farro \"Risotto\" and it had some good flavors going on (Wild Mushroom & Tofu Ragu, Caramelized Fennel & Fennel Pollen,Toasted Walnut & Lucques Olive Tapenade) They also serve cucumber water and that was a nice touch. I also figured, what the hell, might as well try a dessert too! The Doughnut holes with chocolate stout sauce was awesome! I also left feeling like I had still had a healthy meal. The restaurant is pretty small and has a great atmosphere. The lighting fixtures (made from mason jars) are very cool and they have live ferns growing on a wall (hence the name). I will definitely come here again to try some other tasty vegan fare.",

The new menu is very limited, and it appears the prices have gone up as well. I had a warm kale and collard salad with chicken for $18. I also ordered their new cauliflower appetizer... sweet Thai chili... it was good, but not as good as the buffalo was (to me).  Our waitress, who I've had a few times, was super dry and slightly bi-polar... she came across as snobby and condescending. She brought us the check, and I was in a rush so I immediately handed it back to her with my card... she sighed and made this annoyed face. I was blown away.

Everyone was super friendly compared to the last time we went and the guy at the door was terse and unwelcoming.  The food was awesome. Everyone enjoyed their dishes. I had chicken and waffles, hubby had an egg sandwich and daughter had French toast. I will definitely return because they definitely stepped it up and redeemed themselves.",

My friend who is vegan told me how much she enjoyed the restaurant so I made it a goal of mine to try and boy am I glad.   We went one night for dinner and I'm glad we made reservations because the place is small and gets pretty full around dinner time. We started off with the buffalo cauliflower, amazing. The cauliflower tasted just like buffalo chicken nuggets, I was amazed. For our entree I got the chimichanga which again you couldn't tell was vegan but was stuffed with tofu, brown rice, and refried beans. The chimichanga was stopped with cashew cheese, all together it was the perfect combination. My friend got the Alfredo with broccoli, I was a huge fan of the consistency of the cheese sauce on it but it was still good. To finish the meal though full and satisfied we tried the carrot cake, the cake was delicious. The only thing I wished they did was had the cake warm. Definitely will come back I had an amazing experience and the staff is so friendly and helpful.",

Then for entrees we enjoyed the beyond fern and the chef scramble with tofu. I wish they had a pepper jack vegan cheese though. Enjoy some spice. Giving this place a 4 versus 5, because when my tofu scramble came, with cheese added, the cheese wasn't even melted. It was just placed on top. When i cook mine, i always make sure to melt the cheese. I mean, why ask for cheese if it's not going to be melted within the meal?? Also my scramble didn't have much flavor, thankfully I still had sauce left over from the cauliflower appetizer. I added it to the scramble and it gave it a bit more kick. I tried my friends burger with the Brussels. That was bomb!! Especially with the pretzel bun. Had a lot of flavor, and his cheese was more melted. Next time I'm in town, i would come here again. Just recommend, please melt my cheese and hopefully add pepper jack as an option",

Food was FANTASTIC, and the wine recommendation was also perfect.  The waitress suggested a tofu burrito special, and I off-handedly mentioned that I was really craving some vegetables but \"that sounds too good to pass up.\" I inquired if it was possible to sub veggies for the refried beans, but decided it wasn't worth the up-charge. When she brought my plate, though, she had substituted the veggies anyway at no charge! It was such a nice gesture!  I honestly can not recommend this place enough, for vegans, vegetarians, and meat-eaters alike (especially the latter - I love places that can make a skeptic see how delicious and complex plant-based meals are!!) I wish I lived in Charlotte - I'd be a regular - but you better believe I'll be back next visit!",

I know I know it can be a bit scary experimenting with new places and not know if the flavor, taste, texture and over all yumminess that you're accustom to will be the same. Well I can assure you that all of that and so much more is in every Fern Dish. They season their food very well but its not over powering either. I'm a southern girl so I know about proper seasoning with food lol.   So the next time you're feeling meatless, vegan or just wanting to try something new check out Fern!  #yourewelcome",

Not many places can have a stellar breakfast, lunch, dinner And brunch menu, but Fern, they do!   You have to get the buffalo cauliflower bites. Don't even look at the menu when you sit down just say \"I want the cauliflower bites, please!\" Then take your time deciding between the light, yet filling salads and the vegan pho as your main course.   We often share plates. We order three things and nibble our way through the flavors and textures of these well thought out and paired plates.   If you're looking for an amazing brunch you can't go wrong with the nachos and the chocolate strawberry pancakes. Grab a seat on the patio, under the sun or the swaying barista lights and sip a coffee or mimosa while you indulge.   Fern is by far one of my top 5 favorites in Charlotte!!",

    "text": "Give me all the vegetables! If looking for your daily dose of veggies, Fern will deliver.   On my first visit, my party of 3 sat at the long, communal table in the middle of the small restaurant. From our central location, we could marvel at the beautifully decorated space and spy on what every other table in the place was ordering. I loved the rustic feel of the dining area -- wooden farm tables, shabby chic shutters on the ceiling, miss-matched chairs. Super warm and welcoming spot.   We spotted the buffalo cauliflower appetizer at a neighbor's table first and knew it must be ours! I'm so glad we ordered that as it was the highlight of the meal! Piping hot with nice crunch, the hot sauce was balanced perfectly by the buttermilk dill sauce. And, all that was topped with carrot and celery confetti. That's right, folks. Confetti. Of carrots and celery. That takes \"throw some confetti on it\" to a whole new level. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at confetti the same way again.   For my entree, I had the \"tuna\" melt. It was tasty, but not at all what I was expecting from the description. Because it included wakame, I thought it would have an Asian flavor. It didn't -- not the end of the world, just threw me for a loop. If I was in charge of naming this menu item, I would probably call it The Warm Hummus as chickpea is most certainly the star of this dish. The chao cheese was a new adventure! If I hadn't know it was vegan from the menu, I would have thought it was a slice of provolone. I had the veggies as my side. They were pretty unremarkable. After scoping out other Yelper's photos, I probably should have gone with the fingerling potatoes.   The food here was SO filling! We went for lunch at noon, I took half my sandwich and veggies home, and I'm still not hungry for dinner tonight at 7pm. Ironically, I was planning to make meatloaf for dinner. Suppose it'll have to wait until tomorrow.",

I generally order the same dishes each time - the miso mustard brussels sprouts, the fried buffalo cauliflower, and/or the vegetable burger. I will note that I have not tried the new vegetable burger recipe, which appears to now use white beans as a base. However, I was a big fan of their original beet burger - which is high praise, since I am not someone who generally enjoys beets.   The brussels are unique simply because unlike most places that serve them, they aren't fried. They seem to be gently roasted, tender enough but not so soft that they fall apart. The sauce is delightfully tangy and pairs perfectly with the candied nuts that adorn the top. This is my favorite item on the menu, and I'm just sad that they stopped offering it as a side dish for their entrees (you have to order a large appetizer serving from their small plates menu instead).   The fried cauliflower is insanely good, with a creamy ranch topping that works well with the buffalo sauce. Love the sprinkle of chopped carrots and celery on top - not enough to distract from the cauliflower, but a nice added crunch since the florets aren't actually all that crispy.   I'm not vegetarian or vegan, but I enjoy coming to Fern and will come back again. I recommend making reservations for busy nights - it's a small place and there are not many tables.",

Yet, here I am sitting at Fern for Brunch with a look of skepticism on my face, but also kind of interested in taking a chance on a restaurant where I've heard good things.  Ok, Fern, lets do this.  All good brunches have to begin with a Mimosa or Bloody Mary.  Both were reasonably price and made well.  Off to a good start!  Next I dug into some pancakes made with bananas and some toasted oats on top.  This is weird to say, but they were some of the best pancakes I've ever had.  Hearty with a bit of sweetness as I smothered it in syrup (which it didn't need, but it's syrup, so you have to pile it on).  Then came the waiter's recommendation of the steak quesadilla.  Surprisingly, it was delicious.  The wait staff was really great.  They were attentive and knowledgeable.  I never thought the day would come where I would recommend a place like this, but wow, it's definitely worth a try.  Perfect place to take your parents for a nice dinner.",

We were lucky to get a parking spot in front, and I loved the atmosphere - so cozy with a warm glow from their pendant lights, dark green walls (with ferns!), and dark brown wicker chairs.   I had checked out the menu online so that I didn't hold up the group, and we all wound up ordering the black bean burger ($12). I got the BBQ kale chips as my side; my friends got the fingerling potatoes. We all scarfed down our burgers, which came with lettuce, tomato, onions, and pesto. The kale chips were almost a little too crunchy since they kept falling apart when I'd pick them up, but they were tasty; however, I didn't get a BBQ flavor. The fingerling potatoes were grilled in olive oil and garlic - yum! The cucumber water was also a nice surprise and very refreshing.  Our waiter was attentive but seemingly a little peeved about their flatbreads - when we asked about the spinach artichoke flatbread, he gave us a monologue about how their flatbreads aren't really flatbreads since the bread is too thick, blah blah blah. Um, okay.  Overall, the food was tasty and approachable even for carnivores. I just wish it had been a little cheaper - with tip, my lunch was $16.",

    "text": "Wow. So this happened last night and I feel it is important to share, especially considering that I try to make the time for great reviews more than shitty ones. And, that I had no idea I had a reply from Adam, as I don't come here all that often--mostly to check out community reviews! My dear friend and his girlfriend were visiting from TX. They are Vegan and both gluten free because of health concerns (celiac). I'm gluten free because it changed the inflammation in my body significantly. I had forgotten that my last experience at Fern was so poor and suggested them, Luna's, or Perfectly Pizza for dinner. We decided Fern. My mother needs a cane at this point to get around and asked if I would mind stepping in to request an outside table for the four of us for our dinner. There was a man with three dishes in his arms coming towards the entrance/exit, so I held the door for him to get out onto the patio. He looked right at me and DID NOT smile or thank me, much less greet me. I walked inside and a waitstaff person greeted me nicely and then simply pointed to a back table and asked it if would do. The same man that I held the door for greeted us at the table and when I asked what menu items were gluten free (we only were seeing V notations) he replied with: Well, everything has gluten in it so That depends on how gluten free you are. He then went into a brief and seemingly (to All of us), mildly aggressive account of cross-contamination through cooking in a pan and then washing that pan, sharing a fry bath, or just plain gluten in an ingredient.  He then referenced the raw tacos, salads, and side veggies as acceptable. One of my friends asked his name and he replied it was Adam. We told him we would like a minute. One of my friends and I are both in the healing communities and perhaps a bit more sensitive than the average person to \"less than pleasant\" vibrations, especially from people handling our food. I happen to have about a decade's in the food service industry, mainly fine dining and still occasionally serve or bartend for a friend's catering company here in charlotte. I completely understand having an \"off\" day or moment. However, when you are in the service industry, shelving your person issues is fairly paramount to allowing the people that have come for a wonderful experience to happen.  We decided that we didn't want to try to balance his pissy energy and bounced to Luna's where we had a wonderful experience. I'm sure I won't forget this Last time at Fern. Too bad. It was always stellar over on Central. Adam, best of luck getting it all sorted out.",

    "text": "Disappointing! As a vegetarian, I had high hopes for Fern, but the food was flavorless and executed poorly. The atmosphere is cozy, small and quaint with soft, mason jar chandelier lighting. The service was good. But I can't get over how bad the food was.   The CAULIFLOWER POUTINE was a good idea, but the potato mixed with the cauliflower had been whipped to the point of having a glue-y texture. The kind of texture that makes your tongue stick to the top of your mouth while you're trying to chew. The cheese curd tasted like mozzarella, which was fine, but nothing special. The tomato gravy was fine, and the little pile of greens on top were the only interesting flavor in the dish (very strong and herb-y). We were planning to order a few more appetizers, but after the Poutine showing, we ditched that idea.   The OM BURGER was inedible. The bun was dry and hard, and the burger patty was dense and hard and flavorless. The condiments couldn't save this burger.   The 200 YEAR OLD SOURDOUGH FLATBREAD title created a hype that the thick, hard, stale, non-sour flatbread did not live up to. I took 3 bites, which was 2 too many. On the plus side, the topping - chorizo, verde sauce, red onions and cotija cheese - was flavorful and delicious. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in scraping and only eating the top of my pizza.   The sides were also a disappointment. The QUINOA of the day was described as red quinoa, mango, mint, red onion, and some other delicious sounding ingredients. It was fresh and cold, but not at all delicious. After coating with salt, a few bites were edible, but really still no flavor at all.   The SMASHED CRISPY FINGERLING POTATOES had potential, but only 3 of 12 potatoes were actually smashed and crispy. The other 9 were whole boring fingerling potatoes with no flavor or crunch. After mixing the flatbread topping with some of the potatoes, I was able to eat a few bites.   The waitress seemed surprised that we didn't want to take to-go the 75% of our dishes that we didn't eat. No, thanks. We're heading to Taco Bell for a little flavor.",

Fern is a very cute restaurant with a great atmosphere. I love that they can customize your food based on whether you're vegan or vegetarian.

The only thing I can say about Fern is that it was a cleansing experience (especially after stuffing our faces with greasier foods at Food Truck Friday the day before). From the Strawberry Lemonade Juice (strawberry, basil, agave, lemon, cayenne) to the Om burger (yep...just as good as everyone says) to the Cauliflower Poutine (NEVER able to pass up Poutine in any form), it all left me feeling really clean and light. Honorable mentions go to the Ramen as well - I'm always on the hunt for the next great ramen, and I enjoyed this veggie take on it!   If only we hadn't been so full, I would have loved to check out their dessert menu and/or another juice. See you when I'm back in NC, Fern!",

There are more mainstream dishes on each of the menus (lunch, brunch & dinner) to satisfy non hardcore vegetarians, like a locally sourced cheese plate, with delicious homemade bread and jam (which I wish I could buy in a jar and take home), nuts and flatbread. Also- check the \"side items\" options at the bottom of the menu for protein add-ons like goats cheese, avocados, etc. You can tell that the staff are passionate about their food and have an interest in the restaurant doing well. Great place- I hope it stays in my neighborhood!  By the way- If the photo with avocado green walls & white chairs is still the first photo you see in the restaurant profile, be aware that the picture does not represent the newer location on East Blvd. That must be a picture of the old location. The new location has an earthy, airy vibe.",

Reservations are mandatory and TIGHTLY followed. Manager Adam became VERY abrasive when things didn't go exactly according to his plan.   Our experience was horrific & certainly in direct opposition to the parent company, The Mother Earth Group's Mission Statement of \"Nurturing One Another, Our Community and The Earth.\"  Nurturing was not to be had. I was in the neighborhood on the way elsewhere to meet friends at 7 but stopped by Fern. I wanted to say hello to my friend & her friend for a quick drink at 6:22. Upon arrival I was told by 3 people, in a very abrupt manner, within a 5 minute span, the seat I was using from an open 2 top table behind me was for a reservation in about 20 minutes. I said I'd move when the reservation arrives as I'm just here for a drink. The entire area around us was empty. Another reservation for 12 was expected at a center table next to us at 7:15. When the 2 top came in, I quickly returned the seat. The customer was seated w/out issue. As I had an half glass of vino left, I took a chair from the 7:15 party of 12 table & moved to the other corner. This was more than poor uptight Adam the manager could handle. He said I was in some kind of fire exit path & I had to leave. I said I was leaving shortly. Again, I was not keeping anyone from sitting down for their reservation. My friend commented \"Hard to believe you are in the service industry\" and he quickly retorted he would ensure our name was blocked from ever making a reservation there again. We were shocked by the treatment we received collectively.  I completely appreciate someone having reservations & I honored the request to move. Yet I've never been somewhere and felt SO unwelcome as a customer. I want to chalk it up & believe Adam was having a bad day...or he was stressed anticipating his team wouldn't be able to handle a 12 top reservation or something else. But the stringent attitude he has doesn't bode well for managing the front end of a restaurant and dealing with people = customers = our Charlotte community. Sometimes plans don't always work out. Treating customers with grace in tn awkward or challenging time is what can make or break any business. Good luck to Mother Earth in getting Fern back on track and in line with their Mission Statement. With Adam at the helm, they will need it.",

It was tasty but a little too oily and spicy for me.  The waiter recommended the chimichanga so we ordered that as our entree.  We watched three more tables order and and eat their entree.  After asking our server about our order, we watched another table be seated, order, and when their entree arrived we decided it was time to go.  I went in to ask for my bill and then waited again for the server to arrive with the bill.  Finally went in with money in hand to pay before we left.  Finished our lunch at Sunflour Bakery just down the street.  It was delicious.  Fern has a nice patio for sitting and waiting.",

Just don't expect cream cheese like food.  Expect frozen yumminess on a crust of dates and nuts that delights your tongue.",

    "text": "Fern is the second veg restaurant in Charlotte I tried after making the vegan switch. As a super newbie vegan with very few options in the QC, Fern has become kind of a safe haven. The thing I appreciate the most is that everything is easily converted into vegan-friendly dishes.   The food is good, plain and simple. Herbivores and, dare I say, carnivores alike shouldn't have a problem finding something satisfying on the menu. Though, I have to say that brunch is my favorite. Their \"chicken\" fried tofu and waffles is delicious. It's a little spicy and a little sweet. And, their coffee with dark chocolate almond milk is just what you want on a Saturday morning.   I keep seeing people mention the Om Burger. I finally tried it tonight and it was disappointing. The bun, in particular, was chewy and too big. I finally decided to stop fighting with it and just pulled the patty off. My suggestion is to pick one of the other tasty menu items. Dessert on the other hand is fabulous.",

    "text": "Can you say yum? And a healthy, fresh, aesthetic yum at that.   You walk between two heavy curtains as you enter the place. Rustic, earth based, artsy decor.  Focal points are a wall of ferns and felt, and a huge mason jar chandelier hanging from the center of the room. Kinda a hipster vibe/ crowd. Good for dates. Mostly tables for two. We were confused when we entered the room because it took awhile for anyone to greet us.  The initial host was alright, and the server was knowledgeable and aware.   When my dad walked by the kitchen, someone followed him down the hall to the bathroom, peeked in, heard him using the john, and left. Kinda odd.   Unique, quality cutlery at the tables.   We had the sticky sweet cauliflower to start. Was expecting it to be finger food, but it looked more like general Tso's. Topped with sesame seeds, which I loved. We dug in with forks and it had great flavor - not really spicy, but spiced right, and the sauce didn't overpower the cauliflower flavor. Cauliflower was perfectly (very lightly) fried.   Dad ordered the warm kale salad with beet dressing on the side. A tad salty, but still delish, as I love lightly cooked kale. I was apprehensive about the beet dressing, as beets have such a strong taste, but was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too BEETY. He also ordered the OM burger, which he enjoyed sans pickles. Bun was too bready, but was made down the street at Duke's - local a plus.   Fingerling potatoes crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, like I like em. Just a tad salty for me.   I ordered the \"spaghetti\" (zucchini) and \"meatballs\" (white bean, eggplant, breadcrumb). Mom ordered it too, and didn't like the sauce. I thought it went well with the dish. Could taste the eggplant in the meatballs, kinda like eggplant parm.  The  zucchini peel was kind of hard. Would have been better peeled.  Overall we greatly enjoyed our meal and I will return ASAP!",

The food came out in literally 2 minutes.  It was so fast we joked that some one else ordered it and sent it back so they just gave it to us.  They serve beer but 1/2 of them and the one I wanted were out of stock.  Saturday nigh and out of stock on beer?  We got the BBQ Tempeh and the Budda Bowl.  The Mac and cheese as my side was so bad.  How do you mess up mac and cheese in the south.  PS I love Tempeh and make it at home a lot, Theirs was terrible.   Unfortunately I now have a new rule with my wife. I am not allowed to complain any more, ever again, so with our plates full I got the check, Adam our server did not care I paid my bill and left. I bet they served our dishes to someone else.",

Im not a vegetarian or vegan, so im likely biased. Food tasted bland probably because we ordered items with sauce, for sauce to be on side. I was happy they offered non vegan dairy options.   For price point, left dissatisfied and hungry, lol. $40, with tip, for lunch :-(   Nice atmosphere. Parking is very tight and limited.",

I like eating vegetarian foods and don't feel I'm missing out on eating meat.  That said, many people do miss meat or just want an ethical break from it time and again.

The portion sizes are a good size. I ended up with a to go box as I could not finish either dish. I would like to check this place out again as I didn't get to try dessert due to being so full.",

Buffalo Cauliflower-yuuummmm..mum..mum..mum..muuuummm!! I wasn't expecting the flavor action. This dish was seasoned very well, had a little kick of heat, and the vinegar in the hot sauce balanced it all out. They sprinkled the top with diced carrots and celery. How clever. :)  Tuna Melt-my mind totally believed that this was tuna fish. It was super flavorful, smooth yet textured, and the rye bread was a nice addition.  The customer service was great as well.",

First, we were able to eat on a beautiful patio with gorgeous trees. (As well as bring the 1 year old along.)   We started with their seasonal cauliflower. (I say that because I know it changes, but it always looks good.) this one was more of an Asian sweet and spicy sauce.  I was very surprised that the charcuterie board is vegan cheese was as amazing as it was!   For Entrees, I did the beet burger with smashed potatoes (perfectly salted) and my boyfriend devoured his \"chicken and waffles\". (Another converted doubter.)   The cocktails had some good choices available, however were disappointed with our peach cobbler and returned it.",

These dishes aren't going to leave you feeling light and green afterwards but that's the point! The chicken and dumplings and vegan take on fries chicken might as well be better than the meat versions of these dishes and the flavor in the sauces is to die for! Definitely recommend the buffalo cauliflower appetizer that had a delicious sauce and great fry on it!  The patio is also somewhat secluded set back from East Boulevard in Dilworth but has enough elevation for a nice look down at people strolling by on a summer night or weekend afternoon.  This is definitely the kind of vegan restaurant that you could take the meat eater in your family to without them even realizing they're having vegan food.",

I have to say they have a great sitting area but their food was not impressive. I have had amazing vegetarian dishes in Charlotte, Charleston and many other places and this was the worst. It tasted frozen and then heated up to serve. The prices were insane for the quality of the food I got. I did go when they first opened, I am not sure if they have made any adjustments but it will have to be a strong beg to go again sadly.",

The next thing I tried was the OM burger with avocado and mozzarella cheese and roasted veggies. I enjoyed the taste of the burger however, I couldn't get past the texture( crispy outside and mashed bean texture on the inside). If you are not bothered by texture I suggest you try it, the taste was GREAT. I switched the burger out for the Avocado lime toast, it was presented very well! I didn't think it had any flavor outside the beets that were on the top I would have liked it to have more flavor however it ok. It was a great feeling to have a lot to choose from! THANK YOU!",

Although the space inside is tiny, when the weather is nice they open up outside dining options on their patio.  Because they have an open kitchen, sounds of blending and mixing is common to hear during a meal.  It makes me feel better about eating here because I know they aren't being untruthful about their fresh ingredients.  It's always packed so be sure to make a reservation.  Parking can be an issue as the lot they use fills up quickly.  Plan ahead!  They have tables with two types of chairs at each one; nice comfortably padded chairs, and chairs that will make you hate life the entire meal.  Of going with a group, be sure to snag a comfy chair to really enjoy your meal experience. The staff are always very helpful and friendly.  I love the squash noodles and the Mac & Cheese!

Our table enjoyed the burger, chimichanga and tuna melt (all prepared vegan).  The chimichanga was great but the star was the tuna which really tasted like the tuna many of us had given up years ago.  Easily the most elevated vegan cuisine in CHARLOTTE.",

It's the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of buffalo cauliflower as a vegetarian and a cauliflower connoisseur. Fern is a beautiful example of carefully crafted vegetarian food with lots of flavor. The pesto panini is really excellent, as is the tomato soup. I've also gotten the ramen bowl. It was very good, but only if you really love mushrooms. My partner got the fried burrito. I thought it was too heavy to eat something that big that was also deep-fried, but the flavors were great. The fingerling potatoes are really delightful and crispy also.",

She ordered What the chef recommended which was completely gluten-free. About 20 minutes into the dinner she had to run to the bathroom and got really sick. The kind of sick that when's there's gluten in her food. (It ruined her weekend to say the least)  So, i told the server what'd happened and she said \"oh I'm so sorry, shall I bring the bill?\" So I paid and ran to get the car.  In my personal opinion there shouldn't have been a bill, or at least part of it. This is bad business, especially at a health conscious restaurant.   Sorry guys, this situation and the cold attitude I and other friends have always gotten from a manager type (Guy with a beard and glasses?) has kept me from going back ",

    "text": "Updated review: I was really hoping to be pleasantly surprised with my second visit.  I got the spaghetti and \"meatballs\" to go. Even though I called a half hour prior to my pick up, it was not ready and I was told it was accidentally given to somebody else (I understand that accidents can happen.) It was beautifully presented and the flavors of the sauce and white bean and eggplant \"meat balls\" were wonderful! I also loved the texture of the meatballs rather than frozen TVP. The drawback is that the meatballs were not heated through even though I ate one within five minutes of it being handed to me. I'd like to say that perhaps they hurried my order and maybe took it out before final temp (but it was not 145 F for sure.)  I also am used to zucchini noodles being the texture of spaghetti noodles, but instead they were the texture of spaghetti cooked for approximately five minutes versus eight or nine and too crunchy yet (again, maybe they hurried my order because of the earlier mistake?)    I actually wanted to come back earlier to retry the place, but the man that answers the phone lacks professionalism and courtesy. There is no please or thank you and his customer service skills are lacking based on his cold responses to my simple questions about specials of the day. It really made me not want to go back, but I did since I really wanted to give this place a better review (because the manager reached out to me and because I like to support vegan restaurants).  Also, note that at both visits the man that gave me my order was extremely nice and very cordial (not the same person that answers the phone.) So this will end my visits to Fern, and my final rating for them is average, but I surely wouldn't want to deter someone else from trying it.",

The menu offers so many things that you WILL find something to try and leave feeling full, satisfied and wanting to come back for more.   Start small and don't overwhelm yourself. If you are a omnivore, but willing to experiment Fern has you in good hands. Sometimes it's a little scary to try something new because you don't know what tofu is or you had it once and it was awful.  Texture and flavor can be a tricky thing to wrap your mind around, but I promise this is the perfect place to dabble and jump right in.

Although the menu was sort of limited, the food was very tasty with BIG portions!  I had the BBQ Fried Chicken Sandwich(obviously not chicken) and potato wedges and my dining guest had the Beet Burger and a sizable side salad...again, both were pretty darn good!  The wine list was OK and the bar seemed quite adequate with liquor and beers...  Overall, this would be a great way to get some healthy food or just to unwind with a cocktail and an \"interesting\" appetizer like buffalo cauliflower!!!",

Love the atmosphere, it's very cute and quaint. The food is really really good as well. I got the OM burger which is a fried white bean burger on a potato roll with the garlic  broccoli and I'd give it a solid 7/10 stars. Could have used a sauce or a little more seasoning or something to top it off but other than that I was totally satisfied",

It was her first time as well and wanted to try it because it is vegan.  I got there first and was greeted by I believe a waitress. I do not know her name but she had bright colored pink-ish red hair.  The first thing she said when she looked up at me was \"do you have a reservation?\".  I said that we did not. She turned around, grabbed some menus and said \"we can seat you at the bar, you can sit anywhere you like.\"  She was not rude however she was not warm and friendly either.   She walked me over and I sat down and had some water as I waited.  Once my friend arrived and we ordered. Our food came pretty quickly.  I must say for the price the quality of the food was very reasonable.  It was Delicious!  It also felt good to know that I was eating healthy.  I gave this restaurant three stars. I am glad that I tried it and I liked the Decour. If I were the owner however I would somehow find a way to clean up the kitchen a little bit because you can see everything.  You could even see some of the staff eating in the back. I would not be opposed to coming back to this establishment however I will not go out of my way to come here again. There are much better restaurants in Ballantyne!",

I wouldn't advise large parties to eat because it is a small space, however I do believe that the staff will accommodate large parties.   Last but not least the food!!! I ordered the buffalo cauliflower, the Om burger and it comes with a side so I chose the herb potatoes...there was so much flavor in each bite, I can tell that the menu was very well thought out.. even the decor of the establishment was purposeful..I really like the intricate detail of the silverware!",

We went for lunch: 1) tried the Saguaro cocktail - all ingredients I like, but tasted like cough syrup... sent back; 2) ordered the white bean burger, roasted Brussels  and fried cauliflower to split for lunch. Bean burger has a baby food-mush consistency, flash fried with no flavor. Brussels and cauliflower were so doused in sauce such that they were swimming, very unappetizing and very unhealthy.     The service was very very slow.  I was most disgruntled that the manager came over, asked how our meal was, apologized (not genuinely), but didn't comp anything!  I wasn't looking for her to do so, but if you truly want to improve or have repeat customers, at the least offer a free drink voucher to entice customers to come back and try the spot again.   This place won't last.  Your target clientele expects better.",

    "text": "Came across this very interesting menu item - Salt Roasted Beet Burger. For vegan entrees, I've had black bean burgers before. As for a beet burger, I didn't even know these existed. Being adventurous, I went with it and made the best choice I could of from the entire menu. Mustard, pea shoots, black garlic grilled scallion aioli, chevre, pickled vegetables all on a potato bun. I don't even know what half the ingredients actually are, but this thing was freaking delicious. Not only that, but it looks pretty too with the natural colors. The sauces on here were ridiculous. My mind was sort of blown. This was a superb burger and I kept thinking to myself while eating it, that I just might like it better than a regular beef patty burger. Yup, I said it and it is in writing. The potato bun was everything. From here on out, if there's an option for a potato bun on any future burger or sandwich - it's a must. The beet patty was very thick and I was trying to figure out how they mashed the beets into a crab cake like appearance. Simple: they puree lentils, sunflower seeds, and the beets of course and then bake it first and fry it after. Add in some special spices along with the other listed ingridients and wallah - Salt Roasted Beet Burger. Takes about 20 minutes to prepare. Have your napkin ready, the purple juices from the beets will be spilling all over. Vet move: Ask for another potato bun and use it to sponge up the overflowing juices from the burger. Also, a must order at Fern - Sweet Thai Chili Cauliflower. Their carrot cake is pretty solid too. All their food contains locally sourced ingredients. Never would of imagined vegan food to be this good. Glad I broadened my horizons. I'm a big fan of Fern.",

    "text": "VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Fern is delicious for EVERYONE, NOT just for Vegans. Bring the co-worker, the parents, the romantic date, even bring the kids! Fern is now one of my favorite restaurants I have been to in Charlotte, top 5 for sure. Disclaimer: I am not a vegan.   I stopped in at Fern for dinner, made reservations via Yelp on a Friday afternoon. Though this restaurant is small, it is very pretty and nicely decorated. There are tables or you can sit at the bar. You can see the cooks at work just behind the counter. The restaurant is small enough, where your server will ALWAYS be able to see you - no getting lost in the crowd here. The whole concept of this restaurant, it looks like you're seated in a garden. Lots of natural sunlight. Lots of green. Zen music playing in the background.   The food: I was actually INCREDIBLY surprised. The menu has a good amount of starters and entrees - and they're not just salads folks. I'm talking southern style grits,  pasta, buffalo cauliflower, mac and cheese, chick'n dumplings... the list goes on! Honestly, the food was so good I had to sit down and inspect as to whether it was really vegan. But indeed it is, they've perfected these recipes and fooled us non-vegans. I have tried a couple other Vegan restaurants in Charlotte, and this has been the best of the bunch. Fern has the BEST bean burger I have ever tried in my life, PERIOD - the OM BURGER. I will return here, just to buy that bean burger. Perfectly seasoned, it is served with your choice of side. I also highly recommend  the Squash pasta with mushrooms and also the buffalo cauliflower appetizer.  The mac and cheese is also a great choice- major comfort food. The butternut bisque is super addicting with the toast. Honorable mention goes to the Chimi-changa, YOUR FAVE MEXICAN JOINT COULD NEVER! My compliments to the chef, seriously everything is delicious you guys!  The staff was friendly and answered all questions we had. Food came out in like 10-15 mins.  Being able to reserve a table via Yelp is super convenient and easy. Also, they have outdoor seating, I've seen folks hanging out outside with their pups too. This place is appropriate for a date or for just hanging with friends. The drink I ordered was very good. I am not a vegan eater but I will definitely be returning to enjoy \"flavors of the garden\", honestly - this place blew it out of the park for me. 5 stars well earned.",

    "text": "My wife made the decision to eliminate meat from her diet a few months ago. No beef, no pork, not even chicken or turkey. No shellfish, but fish including salmon and mahi mahi is still cool as are eggs and dairy. It's been an interesting time trying to eat around this new program, especially since my daughter and I are unrepentant flesh-craving carnivores.  For this week's family brunch, I offered to try a restaurant completely focused on vegan and vegetarian options. Fern hit the spot with great reviews and options that I felt would minimally inconvenience us meat eaters while giving my wife options other than salad.  As Mrs. K. is still figuring out vegan, I could see that the menu was a little complicated. So while we studied it, I got us started with coffee (with almond milk. Stevia and Sugar-in-the-raw on the table) and the cinnamon rolls. The rolls arrived and we were able to place our brunch order. Tasty and doughy, not too sweet at all. Yum.  Sausage and gravy for my wife, Mediterranean scramble for daughter and the zucchini/spinach benedict for me. It was clear by what was left when we asked for the check who had enjoyed their meal most thoroughly. It was me - my plate was clear. The zucchini fritters were tender and moist, sort of like a crab cake except without crab. Topped with steamed spinach, poached eggs and hollandaise, really tasty. I'd recommend it thoroughly.  The scramble wasn't that great, according to daughter. Rather bland, she said. And she didn't care for the quinoa. Oh well. Mrs said that the biscuits were too cakey but the gravy was good.  For sides, I had the crispy braised fingerling potatoes. It was as close to home fries as you're going to get and they were perfectly crunchy and salty. The sweet potatoes were good (tender and sweet), but not the best choice for their brunch meals.  Service was excellent. The coffee was great. And the price was pretty decent.  I don't know that we'd return for brunch, but only because it's challenging for the carnivores. Maybe lunch or dinner next time. That said, you herbivores would love this place.",

I was greeted right away by a friendly hostess who offered me the option to sit where I wanted. Since it was a nice cool evening, I sat outside.   I ordered the buffalo cauliflower because I had been craving wings for days! I must say the cauliflower was cooked and seasoned to perfection and satisfied my desires! I had a side of vegetable puree soup but it was quite a heaping helping so I did not finish it all.  That didn't stop me from ordering the carrot cake...the best Vegan carrot cake I've ever had. The chia icing was perfect and the cake was moist, the only thing I'd change is to remove the raisins, I hate raisins but that's probably a 50/50 thing with carrot cake lovers. You either love them or hate them in your carrot cake.  I'd go back any time and would love to check out the rest of the menu.",

I have huge respect for any vegan restaurant that doesn't make you eat flowers and grass . However  I feel that the food could taste better here. There is potential to make the food great. We had eggplant flatbread which I loved the bread part more than the eggplant. I ordered chimichanga which the inside filling tasted like sofritos from chipotle only much saltier. The shell was very crispy and tasty. Whoever does their baking is doing a good job. My husband had \"ramen\" bowl with plant noodles I think he enjoyed it, but was not excited to get not the actual noodles.  Food needs improvement.",

    "text": "Fern is a perfectly adequate spot for vegan food and meals. Decided to try this place out during restaurant week so I could get more of a complete experience. My friend and I made reservations for a Thursday evening at 6:00 and were able to be immediately seated. I'm not sure if the night was typical or not but it completely filled up within the hour.  The parking situation for Fern is pretty nonexistent so your best bets are parking across the street in the Healthy Home Market shopping center. Fern is a cozy spot that's heavy on decorative charm: mason jars, twinkle lights, and the heavy placement of ferns (naturally) around the restaurant.  Back to the food and drink: We decided to go the cocktail route and started off with spiked teas. I found these pretty blah. The tea was quite weak and there just wasn't much flavor. For appetizer, we both chose the beet and goat 'cheese' crostini - a very delicious bite! The 'cheese' was really creamy and perfectly balanced the beet. First course: we both chose the butternut bisque. This was my favorite part of the meal. The bisque was hearty and topped off with pepitas (my favorite). It was also pretty to look at. Second course: fried tempeh with mashed potatoes and kale (I think it was kale). This wasn't bad, the fried tempeh had a nice crunch but, honestly, I did miss having meat during this course. Dessert: I went with the turtle cake and my friend went with the pineapple bread pudding. She absolutely loved her dessert and couldn't stop raving about it. I thought the turtle cake was all right. The cake was very dense and a little dry but the peanut butter mousse saved it.  I'm not sure I would go back to Fern for a full-on meal, maybe for a quick bite or for one of their smoothies/juices.",

The food: I started with the buffalo cauliflower and it was an excellent alternative to buffalo wings. The cauliflower was crisp and the sauce was on point. Even my meat-loving boyfriend thought it was great. For my meal, I had the kale caesar salad. I was very impressed with the vegan replication of a caesar dressing.  I also tries the buffalo chicken burger and I was deeply impressed with the coconut bacon. I do not like coconut (it is the sole food I am not a fan of) but this \"bacon\" had no noticeable aftertaste of coconut and was SO CRISPY. We finished with the lemon cheesecake. Great flavor, certainly not as dense as standard dairy cheesecake but the taste was fresh.   The staff: Considering my boyfriend was a bit fickle about the tables because of the angle of the sun (moved twice) the wait staff was still friendly to us!  This particular experience was very average with regard to the staff - no complaints but my life wasn't changed.",

The only downside was our waitress reacted negatively after my husband ordered eggs. After that she was less attentive to only him but was courteous to me. Maybe fern should consider taking eggs off the menu? As a vegan I understand how it can be troubling to see people engage in behavior that results in animal cruelty. However the meat, egg, and dairy industry is more challenged by reductionism than people who would have been vegan either way. It's important to cultivate a welcoming atmosphere where people can experience vegan food and realize it isn't giving up that much (especially when the food is as good as it is at fern). Seriously, you should still try it. In the past this was never an issue, unlike it was today. I'm little disappointed because I'm not sure he'll go back, although I will. The food is that good. Compared to to fern, getting dirty looks at Outback for ordering a plain unbuttered sweet potato is very underwhelming.",

The dining room is small and intimate, and the decor is muted colors with rustic decorations. Very quaint.   Food: Good - We got the Indian tacos, a somosa appetizer and the OM burger. I could not taste any Indian influence in the Indian tacos. They tasted like normal tacos. The samosas tasted fine and came with an onion chutney and creme sauce, but nothing that really stood out. Our friend said the OM burger was pretty good. The food presentation was beautiful and creative though.   Price: Reasonable - Prices were on par with other restaurants in the area.   We will definitely go back and try more offerings, and are very thankful for a vegetarian restaurant. It's definitely tasty enough to return many times, but it was nothing I would crave or bring out of town guests to.",

Dinner has a bunch of healthy, lower-carb vegan options (plus less-healthy desserts, but I do not regret the ice cream sandwich!). Brunch consists more of hearty Southern options but was very good. Highly recommend the cinnamon rolls as an app! Good service and the patio is dog-friendly.",

After taking a cab from the Ritz-Carlton to Fern just to try their food  -- what we received was food that was very bland in taste and heavy on salt.  Myself and my wife ate less than 10% of our meals and the waitress never asked to see how we liked our food.  The manager finally came to ask how we were doing.  After explaining the situation she never even attempted to correct the situation or offer reparations.  I highly recommend avoiding this place especially if you are in the uptown area as there are so many good restaurants with excellent staff in this area.  Very disappointing.",

My husband had the OM Burger which he stated was equally enjoyable. I have eaten at several vegan/vegetarian restaurants in several states and I must say, I give Fern fairly high scores. I hope Charlotte continues to expand its vegan restaurant community like what is happening out west and in the northeast.",

Fern is a great place to bring non-vegetarian friends if they want great-tasting slow-food and treats that are as visually appealing as they are delicious. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the food leaves you satisfied without feeling stuffed.   Some vegetarian menus only work in warm weather, but Fern is definitely a place you can go to warm up and fill up this Winter!",

However, I am open to interesting cuisines of all types... so my wife and I went to Fern a few weeks ago to see what it was all about.  The ambiance was great; really cute decor, and plants hanging everywhere.  The staff was super-friendly... everything felt quaint and cozy.  We each got a juice to start with.  I got something red which was a bit too sweet, and my wife got something green which tasted like a freshly mowed lawn smells.   I drank quite a lot of hers, mostly out of sheer amazement that it wasn't killing me.  The cuisine was all really imaginative and well executed.   This was easily the most creative restaurant we've been to in Charlotte.    We'll definitely be going back.",

After numerous friends recommended we give it a shot, my wife and I decided to check it out for brunch. We sat outside and enjoyed both the vibe, the service, the cocktails, the muffins and fresh jam (the highlight sadly).  Unfortunately the main dishes were a huge disappointment. We shared chicken (tofu) and waffles and huevos rancheros and both missed the mark. We had heard chicken and waffles were a must try and it had great potential, but was ruined with a waffle that required a chainsaw to cut that tasted like cardboard (it was made with spelt). The tofu was somewhat interesting, though not very fried chicken like IMO, but without a solid waffle this dish was a fail. The huevos rancheros was boring, even with the added vegan cheese, and I doubt we will ever return.",

I had the huevos rancheros and the hubs had an egg and \"pot roast\" hash. Both dishes had well-balanced flavor palates, and were surprisingly filling.   We enjoyed the cute decor of the place and the wait staff was very friendly. I only have two complaints:  1) there were some items on the menu that I asked about whether or not they were gluten-free. Two different servers weren't sure and had to go ask the kitchen. I feel that for such a specialized restaurant that boasts so many dishes to be dairy and gluten-free, the entire wait staff should be well-informed about all dishes. After all, a lot of their clientele are likely going to Fern for their alternative menu options.   2) this is perhaps a bit petty, but I find it very polarizing...most of the wait staff had VERY DIRTY HAIR. Now, I understand the whole organic/granola/healthy/hippie movement/most-people-shower-more-than-they-need-to thing, but come on! Wash your hair!! If you're serving me food, I don't want to be able to smell your dirty mop when you're walking toward me. Believe me, your delicious food and adorably earthy decor already speak volumes about how hipster y'all are. No need to underscore it by skipping the Pantene for a week. Just sayin.'   Those two small issues aside, I fully intend to visit this little gem again in the future and have already recommended it to a lot of my health-conscious (AND freshly showered) friends. :)",

    "text": "Fern is the kind of restaurant, where after finishing your meal, will say \"that was great\"-- but may not necessarily crave an item enough to put the restaurant on regular lunch/dinner rotation.  I've been here a few times, and each time, service was good, and the ambiance is nice with super rustic slab wood tables, custom-made fern-filled felt wall art, and artichoke salt and pepper shakers.   For appetizers, the squash blossoms *are* as good as everyone says.  Creamy insides, crisp outsides. Very flavorful, despite the perception vegan cheese is bland.  But since they're out of season, they'll have an alternative appetizer.  Today it was potato croquettes (sweet potato and purple potato) dipped in pesto.  These were nice, though something slightly amiss.  Perhaps, too creamy inside? Nonetheless they were piping hot and fresh from the fryer.   We also had the soup starter featuring yellow peas (I believe...) and butternut squash.  Nice, not overly salty, had sweet flavor from onions and squash.  Only served with a piece of toasted bread the size of a postage stamp.  Because the soup isn't a hearty, creamy soup, it would have been nice to have a larger piece of crusty bread to dip.   This Indian fry bread appetizer is of the Native American kind of fry bread, not Indian from India.  Topped with a bean chili-type mixture, tomato and cheese, it's like an all-natural puffy taco.  My only criticism, which was shared by another woman I sat across the room from, the fry bread is a bit tough.  It's hard to cut and very chewy. Flavors are good.   The popular Om Burger was indeed good. It was mostly because the bun was nicely toasted, the burger itself was meaty in texture, and the goat cheese a nice add-on.  Quinoa salad is a nice accompanying side.  I still like the veggie burger over at 131 Main better (I've had it about 6 times...beet and brown rice based with teriyaki glaze and havarti cheese.)  The Buddah Bowl changes, and I've had it two different times.  Both times, the veggie selection is nice, the vegan sauce/veggie sauce to accompany is good too, but could use a kick.  I mean, like Nicole W. mentioned, it needs spice of some kind.  Pot Pie: Mushroom cream sauce and large chunks of summer squash, a few pieces of carrot, and chickpeas.  I really liked the flavor of this dish hot. Thick, creamy, and again, super hot. But the veggies really varied in doneness.  The carrots were kind of hard...some yellow squash was medium hard...some zucchini was well cooked, as were the mushrooms.  When I think pot pie, I also would like a real puff pastry or any kind of \"top\".  Instead, it comes with a croissant.  Not the buttery, flaky make-a-mess-on-your-lap kind, but a hybrid 30% real croissant, and 70% Pilsbury Crescent Roll.  It's more bread than a croissant.  (Look at how in-depth I'm going into the scientifics of this carbohydrate product.) It was good at sopping up the sauce, and got the job done.  Just not what I expected.   I also wondered why the vegetables in the pot pie weren't in season, and why they were so  ununiform in size. I had giant chunks of carrots...but small chickpeas, slivers of SUMMER squash.    I think that does it for now.  Overall, it was good.  I felt good after I ate here, and would take my friends, veggie or not.  I did head a couple diners complain to their server about waiting 40 minutes for their main entrees to arrive...and I did overhead some other diners being just so-so satisfied with their meals.  If Fern amped up the flavor just a bit, and made some minor improvements, this restaurant would be a knock out.",

Every single time and with different waiters they are just pushy and annoying on wanting to take your order and have you out if there fast. I found out by chance that they were taking orders for Thanksgiving meal on the last day as advertised on their website. I called and they said we are no longer taking orders and once I pointed out that according to their website that day was still within the range they said no in an annoyed snd non apologetic way. Still I'm masochist enough to take my sister and her husband visiting out if town because I always raved to them about the food to only witness what I feel is just outrageous.

I'm not sure. Regardless, yummy. I ordered the strawberry lemonade smoothie which tied me over perfectly until my \"chicken\" and waffles arrived. Those were great! Deep brown fried goodness over firm tofu triangles. Those were served over waffles that were not as firm and crusty as I like them but maybe the ingredients they use don't get that way in the waffle iron. The syrup was sweet and spicy.  My husband got the eggs Benedict which had great textures going on.  He also got a cocktail although I don't recall which one but was fantastic.

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I'm a total foodie and that one of my favorite things in life is to try out new (to me) restaurants. As a result, I'm easily at a new (to me) place at least once a week, often more so than that. Why am I telling you all of this? Because you need the context when I say - BEST RESTAURANT I HAVE TRIED IN THE PAST YEAR.  (Further context - in the past year, I've been in NYC, San Diego, Seattle, New Orleans, Nashville, Washington DC, and various parts of North Carolina and Virginia. And this place is better than anything I've tried in any of the aforementioned locations. It is THAT good.)  The first thing I noticed upon walking in was the ambiance and decor. The decor is simple, yet elegant, and just absolutely beautiful. I loved the mason jar \"chandeliers\" and the vertical garden.   Secondly, the menu is almost all vegan and none of the \"faux meat\" crap that you see in so many vegan restaurants. Though they have a veggie burger, it's a mix of real veggies versus a pile of processed junk. Fern really highlights the vegetables. From what I understand, they are all local and organic.   The menu is very creative and there truly seems to be something for everyone.   Finally, and most importantly, the food was outstanding. I had the tofu po'boy - the bun was soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and appeared to be lightly grilled. The sprinkle of multi-colored sesame seeds added a nice little crunch and flavor. The cole-slaw on the inside absolutely made the sandwich. Mindblowingly delicious. Creamy and full of flavor. I would slather on everything.   I also ordered the kale salad with beets to go. Lots of texture and flavor.   I was too full for dessert, but next time I'm in Charlotte, I will be in Fern every single day.",

I enjoyed my dinner in their outside seatings. I liked all the items on their menu. I ordered fried rice with Tempe and Lima beans. It was fancy and well presented. At the same time, quite delicious. Do try one of their smoothies. I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the meal. I told waitresses that I feel like I am on a date with myself, which is great. The overall experience was great.  The staff is friendly and very attentive. I could not ask more for a nice meal and better service. I think Friday night well spent with a good meal and walk in the Plaza midwood hood.  I highly recommend this place.",

We love the seasonal, changing menus (the side of local mixed veggies changes every day) and the fresh ingredients, the desserts are great (love the turtle cake and apple cake), you get super refreshing cucumber water, plus I get a night off from cooking! There have been a few times I've had an inconsistent dish. There are also a few items on the menu I feel I make better in my own kitchen. The parking is also inconvenient. However we love this place for date night and can indulge in yummy vegan food in one of my favorite and personally nostalgic areas of the city. We have brought friends here and they love it, too. I've been loving the falafel salad lately; it's very filling, the falafel reminds me of crab cakes and the curried banana peppers are so delicious. Planning on going this week for my birthday dinner and I'm very excited (: Love this place, try it if you haven't!",

Disappointed in the irony that the OM burger had garlic and onion, when no True yogi eats such things. Perhaps with proper notice they will be able to accommodate our needs. The excuse that vegetarian food can't be tastefully flavored without garlic or onion is uber-lame. The food we DID get was decent enough; we hope with proper notice the chef can become creative. Cooking is an art that I hope they will learn. Anyone can throw pungent stink-veggies at a prep and call it \"tasty.\" For real money, I expect better. I have hope that next time, we'll get it.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been going to Fern since they opened and it's become a real hit and miss experience. Somedays the experience is so disappointing I never want to go back but then again, they have 2 dollar beers on Tuesdays and 1 dollar Bloody Mary's during brunch so what's a frugal lush to do?!   I've tried many of their dishes and had been wanting to try their Chicken and Waffles FOREVER and finally when that day arrived, I'd never experienced such a dining disappointment like that. First off it's WAFFLE NOT WAFFLES YOU GET ONE SUPER DRY FLAVORLESS WAFFLE. The vegan \"chicken\" was \"ok\" - the batter way too thick and fried a little too long. Underneath the chicken was that one awful waffle. The serving of syrup is way too small as well. It was like a shot of syrup. Another dish that was a big let down was the biscuits and gravy. The biscuit was as hard as a rock and the gravy had a sour aftertaste that reminded me of vomit. Sorry but that's what it made me think of. And their grits? More like grime. Slimy pasty grime. No never again.   On a posi note, recently tried the Chili Rellanos and the Taco Flatbread and both were awesome. Really fun and flavorful! The Chili Rellanos was fried to perfection and the batter was so light and crisp! It was fantastic!   One thing I feel I should mention in regards to our last experience is that Adam should not be a server, should not be a representative of Fern. He's rude, doesn't bring - or at least offer - glasses when you order a beer and is just in a word: unfriendly. Any other server we've had has been warm and welcoming. I don't like calling people out but anytime this guys been our server we haven't felt like we were appreciated or like a valued customer.   I'm not sure if we'll go back to Fern but if we do, I hope for more consistency with the food and service. I mean it's great to get 2 dollar beers and 1 dollar Bloody Mary's and Patatas Bravas is to die for as is the breakfast nachos but servers like Adam ruin the experience.",

As we thought it opened at nine, we arrived about an hour early for brunch. We decided to enjoy the weather and sit and chat, and after doing so for awhile, Chef Matt came out and spoke to us. He was kind, inviting, and very gently told us they opened in an hour. Once we entered, we decided on the selection of muffins with jams and butter to start with, but were surprised to be brought out both cinnamon rolls and muffins! Chef Matt kindly treated us to the cinnamon rolls for waiting- and what a treat- those cinnamon rolls were the best part of the meal! Creamy, well spiced, and with a hint of citrus, I couldn't believe they were vegan! The muffins were excellent as well, and were followed by Patas Bravas with a great spicy sauce (add avocado, it's worth it)! Fern has quickly become my new favorite Charlotte restaurant, and my meat eating friend agreed! The staff was attentive and excited, which was just a cherry on top of the excellent meal! They even packed the muffins and extra cinnamon rolls, with extras of all the spreads! Great attention to detail. We will be back!",

It's not like other universally liked dishes such as pizzas, burritos or ice-cream! The food is truly unique, and healthy too. Where have you seen or tasted a drink made with beets, fennel, apples, cucumber and turmeric? Strange - yes, but not bad tasting. I also tried a beverage made with almond milk, vanilla and blueberries. They have enough items on their menu to intrigue me and make me want to go back for more. I had the OM burger, which kinda reminded me of a falafel because of it's fried texture. I'm definitely going back to try the indian tacos & squash blossom hush puppies, and will probably wash it down with their Violet bliss made from pomegranates, agave and lemonade.. yumm :)",

The atmosphere was a bit yuppified - the mason jar and hemp chandelier installation really sets the tone. Service was quick, attentive, and very friendly. It's all about the little details, like cucumber water and only serving in-state breweries' beer. They walk a thin line of pretentiousness, but the food and people are good enough to keep from crossing it.  I ordered the vegan ramen, and the boyfriend had barbeque tempeh. I have never had anything that tastes like my meal before. I mean this mostly as a good thing. :) His opinion: \"I really like it! It's fun and tastes really good, I'm just not sure what I'm eating.\" Seaweed flakes, coconut foam, and pureed something-or-another just aren't typically on the menu for us. I thought it was fun, but I'd hesitate to take any less adventurous friends or family.  Weird side note for coffee snobs - they use instant coffee! Not the \"real\" stuff. I actually liked mine enough that I asked where it was from and was surprised.",

And if you request more than the 2 drops of dressing on it, they charge you for it. Service was lacking and very unsatisfactory.   We also ordered the Alfredo flatbread that was so bland, cardboard would've tasted better. DONT under any circumstances order the vegan cheese. It was horrendous. Even the server agreed but did nothing to offer any solution.   We also ordered the \"falafel\" appetizer... the description said it was a classic falafel. What we got was nothing close to a falafel. It was so dense and raw dough-like. No flavor. Hard to swallow. Again, they were stingy with the dressing. The only way to stomach this dish is to drench it in the tzatziki dressing, which again they charge extra for.   I'm not hard to please as a customer because I myself am in the restaurant industry. I know how things go. I paid for food that wasn't good when I shouldn't have. Even something as simple as our server coming over (or the manager) and apologize would have been nice But we got nothing. Unacceptable.",

FOOD: This is a vegan restaurant, however some of the things they have may have artificial flavoring (i.e. almond milk). I had ordered the pesto panini with tomato soup bisque, which was all good, however the panini was a bit greasy. For some particular reason, the coffees that we were served was never hot, it was always just mildly warm which was very irritating.

    "text": "So, if I am being honest here, I was definitely hesitant on Fern.  I am not a meat lover, but do feel every meal must include a protein (chicken or fish).  And, of course the entire day, I wanted a hamburger.  Needless to say I joined my Dinner Group at Fern after checking out the menu, other Yelp reviews and photos.  From the menu I thought I could branch out and may be some of the Seitan options would really taste like meat. We arrived around 7:00 and I was able to observe the restaurant. Very simple, with a great setup and comfortable feel.  We decided to start with several appetizers:  Brussel Sprouts, Pimento Cheese Dip, Cauliflower, Noshes and Choizo and Cheese Dip.  The appetizers were all amazing. Great flavor, fresh and definitely great portion sizes to share with several.  I have to say the Brussel Spouts and Chorizo and Cheese Dip were my two favorites. The chorizo dip, served in a hot skillet, definitely did not taste vegan and had a great kick to it, with some peppers and corn, served with toasted bread.  As for the entrees, I wasn't as impressed as I was with the starters.  I chose the OM Burger, a white bean patty, with a side salad. First, the patty, too mushy. The waitress made it sound like it had a panko breaded crust, offering different textures, but it all appeared to be the same to me.  Just the same consistency with no real flavor, very bland.  The salad was a disappointment too, very blah.  The others enjoyed the bolognaise, black bean burger and chili rellanos.  Several people really didn't say too much about their entrees, while others enjoyed.  I think it was mixed bunch, especially after we all LOVED the appetizers.  Two of us decided to split the chocolate cake with peanut butter mouse. The cake was too hard, very dry, but that mousse...OMG.  I could eat it was a spoon out of a jar. It was smooth with an amazingly light peanut butter flavor.  I think Fern is definitely a great place to check out. I suggest enjoying a good beer or wine and having some appetizers, you won't be disappointed!",

Well I can tell you that Fern knocks it our of the park with taste, presentation, and it's trendy recycled ambiance. It is quite cozy so during the weekends it might be a wait and you may be sitting close to the next party but GO! You won't regret it.",

It has a small intimate setting with very limited seating.  I would highly suggest making reservations before visiting. There is a beautiful patio outside perfect for warmer weather. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and the service was fast.  I ordered the Pork Cutlet made seitan, cauliflower puree, lentils and spinach. I was a little nervous to try the seitan because I've never had it. It honestly taste almost like chicken lol. My dish was flavorful and I loved it.  I also had the buffalo cauliflower and brussels sprouts as an appetizer. The cauliflower was tender, crunchy and seasoned to perfection. The Brussels sprouts were made with a maple sauce topped with coconut bacon. Both of these dishes were delicious.  Lastly, I  had the Chocolate Pots de Creme which a chocolate mousse topped with strawberries and whipped creme. The mousse with light and very flavorful. It was hard to put my spook down.   Overall the food was great and I didn't leave feeling stuffed.The only downfall about this place is the size of the place and the parking. I would've definitely give them 5 stars but the parking options are really bad. This is a must try.",

I really liked it but I have to be honest & say I like California Pizza Kitchen's version better. The squash file was an acorn filet very thickly sliced with some sauce over it. The flavor was bland & unimpressive. At a price of $17 I was not surprisingly disappointed because Vegan food can be flavorful & tasty.  Several of the items on the menu were imitation meat meals like tofu \"pork chops\". I don't like the flavor of meat so I wish they would focus on showing how vegan meals can be delicious in their own right using complex blends of spices & vegetables.  Hopefully Fern will continue to improve their recipes.",

We arrived extremely late after a long Saturday of running errands and hanging out family style. Fern closes at 9pm and we arrived around 8:30pm, we walked up to a open lit patio with people eating and we entered Fern and was greeted and asked if we wanted to dine on the patio or inside. The night air had started to have a nip to it so I opted for inside. We had a window table to the left of the entrance and our service came over immediately after we sat and had a little while to review the menu.  He asked if we wanted anything to drink besides water which we declined. I went on to ask him the best items on the menu. He ask was I Vegan and I replied YES and my husband wasn't Vegan. He suggested the Chimichunga for me as a Vegan favorite and my husband the Chicken Bacon (coconut bacon) ranch burger as a non vegan favorite. We both got the fingerling potatoes as a side to share with our toddler as he ate off both of our plates as they didn't have a kids menu which is sucky and one of the two reasons they didn't get a 5 star rating. The other reason is the fact that there are no changing tables. I'm BIG on places having a changing table as families spend lots of time out and a changing table is key when out as it's already difficult enough to change a child so without a changing table it's worst and more acrobatics involved to accomplish. I'll definitely be back as my food was amazing.",

Every time I'm back in Charlotte, I make a point of coming here and bringing several people with me who otherwise wouldn't be eating vegetarian/vegan. I've recommended Fern to many people solely based on the quality of the food.   However, I've had several bad experiences now with the individuals working here, including those in management. They have actually turned business away on what seems to be slow nights rather than properly planning out their tables. We were at Fern the other night (just four of us) and were told we couldn't get seated on this random weeknight unless we chose to sit at the bar. Meanwhile, we watched a group of three sit in the middle of an 8 person table, with three extra seats on one side and 2 on the other... + there were at least two other open tables.   Fern, because you choose not to treat all customers equally and make an attempt to accommodate customers (who are even willing to wait for a table!), you have now lost my business and my recommendations to others.",

THE MANAGER was the unfriendliest, atleast to US.  He came to our table three times to bring out different things during our visit, never once spoke or smiled or said \"you're welcome\" to our \"thanks yous\". We saw him go to two different tables with heterosexual couples and he was friendly to them and spoke to them. THIS IS THE MANAGER!!!!! As an employee of a restaurant myself, this was so unacceptable. I don't know if his problem was with our sexuality, or our race, or if he just didn't like us, but to talk and smile with other tables and never open your mouth to us, as guests at your establish especially as the manager, it's disgraceful. I'm not sure I will return as we left feeling unwelcome. I believe the waitress said the manager on duty was Adam.",

Where my family is from in India, meat and eggs are not common (however we do drink milk and I eat cheese). With that said, I know good vegetarian food and this is not a place worth visiting for veggie fare.  I was very excited to go to Fern and hubby and I decided to go and treat a colleague. I ordered BBQ eggplant, which was basically raw and tough and barely cooked. The mac and cheese was weird in flavor and not in a good way -- it was sweet too which was not appealing.  My hubby ordered ramen and he said it had no flavor. The broth was so bland, he had to jack it up with hot sauce and salt to give it some flavor.   Our friend enjoyed his tempeh plank, so the night wasnt a total loss.  Its a pretty establishment, but for the price we paid we were greatly disappointed. Wont be going back, as there are other fabulous vegetarian restaurants in the area.",

The decor is fantastic-- this place really has a lot of personality! The service was wonderful...very friendly, charismatic and hospitable. We sat in the outdoor dining area, next to their garden, which I thought was a nice touch. We had the smoked onion rings as an appetizer and they were delish! I really loved the vegan remoulade. On the con side, I did feel that Fern is pricier than it needs to be. I ordered the Tofu Pad Thai as my entree and I felt that $18 is too expensive for what is essentially just carrots, tofu, and cashews. I will say that it was pretty good though. :) All in all, I would probably return. Their brunch menu looks pretty tempting. :)",

We are both vegetarian and were eager to try a place where we could order anything on the menu. I'm glad to say we were not disappointed!   I had their portabella steak and cheese sandwich, and my husband got the naked OM veggie burger. Both of these dishes were fantastic and full of flavor. The marinate for the portabella steak had the perfect amount of spice without being too salty. I got a side salad with their house dressing. The slivers of zucchini were a great touch, and the dressing was delightfully tangy. The OM burger had a great constancy, and was cooked well.  Great flavor! The fried potatoes on the side complimented the burger well.   Why not a five star review? Although the flavors were amazing, but the sandwich and the burger were a little dry. The homemade buns/rolls were light and had a great taste, but there was too much of them. The OM burger was great, but was very dry. I wish there was less bun, or more dressing. The sandwich had the same problem. I also wish the side salad had smaller lettuce leaves. I know it's kind of a minor complaint, but the didn't cut the lettuce leaves at all, which made it hard to eat.   Other then those two minor complaints the place was fantastic for a casual lunch or dinner. Very cute decor, very flavorful food. I will enjoy going back there and can't wait to try their other dishes!",

Walked in once and there was no room...not even to wait, unless hovering over a dining patron counts. Second time, we knew better and got a table with our name on it.   The food is good. We started with a cheese plate. Nice selection and well presented. The food was very flavorful and made with fresh ingredients. The cucumber water added a nice, refreshing touch.  The service was good, attentive, and friendly.   Like others mentioned, to make this even more of a perfect experience, there are a couple things I'd recommend. When you walk in, if it's windy or cold (yes, it's been a season or two since I was here), it all comes in with you and you get stares from everyone. It would be great if they installed a revolving door. Like I said earlier, there's no waiting area (who knew they'd be in such demand?) due to maximizing the dining area.  Overall, great experience and fresh eats designed to please everyone in your party!",

    "text": "After driving past (because of no outdoor signage that's lit), we finally arrived at Fern around 8:30 on Saturday night.  We made our grand entrance through some curtains, stepping right into the dining room and angering the customers nearby who received the cold gust of wind that followed us in.  (They really need a waiting area/host stand and something more than curtains to block the outside from coming inside.)    We were asked if we had a reservation.  We didn't really think we needed one since it was getting pretty late in the evening for dinner, but apparently it's a very good idea.  Who knew it would be so crowded?  So we made a reservation at that point with the owner and we said we'd come back around 9.  We walked a little ways up the street for a drink at Midwood Smokehouse while we waited.    We came back around 9, angering customers near the doorway again.  We were taken to a room outside of the dining room which appeared to be the waiting room for Something Classic Catering with a view of the kitchen.  There were a couple of makeshift tables set up in this room for dining guests which seemed a bit tacky because you were basically seated in a hallway.  I would not have been pleased to have been seated there if I were them.    We were brought water (cucumber water?) by one of the servers while we waited, which was really nice.  Then that same server asked if we wanted to try their warm sangria while we waited.  We figured they were being extra accommodating to us since we were being asked to wait for a table even longer.  The server brought out these huge mugs with warm sangria which was kind of like a hot mulled cider.  It tasted pretty good, but wasn't something I would normally order.    After we were brought to our table, we were given two copies of their extended past-the-date Queen's Feast menu and only one copy of their regular menu.  Our server politely informed us that they were out of the panini sandwich.  We didn't really want the 3-course meal (actually 4-course here) options, so we had to pass the one regular menu back and forth to share.  We decided we'd share an app and then both get bowls of soup and the only other entree on the menu besides the panini, the veggie burger.    We ordered and then were informed by the server that they just ran out of the veggie burgers, too.  Huh.  So both entree options were gone, leaving us with just soup, apps, and salad.  I found this very ironic at a vegetarian restaurant.  I'm forever reading complaints from vegetarians that restaurants don't have enough veggie options besides salads and here at a vegetarian restaurant, I see the same thing.    We ordered the Indian tacos as an app, bowls of the squash soup, and two salads.   At first I thought the Indian tacos would have a curry flavor, but upon closer inspection of the menu before we ordered, I was excited to see that they were actually Native American tacos, made from fry bread, a delicacy we had recently discovered out in Phoenix.  And they were really delicious!  I'd definitely recommend them to anyone, especially if they've never tried fry bread.    The squash soup was delicious, too.  It was very flavorful and came with some tasty toasted pumpkin seeds on top.    Last was our salad (our substitute entree).  It looked like Bibb lettuce with feta cheese, cold cubed roasted squash, and more pumpkin seeds.   It was delicious, but was pretty small for the $12 price tag.  Luckily, we were pretty full already from the tacos and soup.    While we ate, I watched the people at certain tables every time the door opened and they were blasted with the gust of cold air.  They were not having a good time, and I was glad we weren't seated at one of those tables (or the ones out in the hallway!).    Our server delivered our bill and we were a little (but not too) surprised to find the warm sangria on there at $8 a cup.  We thought it was being given to us a nice, warm gesture, but apparently it was just a sneaky way to upcharge the bill.  (Be forewarned!)  That's when I sucked down the rest of it to get our money's worth.  I think Fern is still going through its growing pains and we hope they make some changes that would really make a fantastic restaurant option, including redefining their dining room spacing and breezeway issue, offering more vegetarian options other than salad and/or not running out of both entree choices (!), and not offering an $8 drink as a \"sample\" and then charging for it.    The food options we did experience were delicious, though.",

The dessert was actually really delicious (turtle cake), a peanut butter ice cream with a vegan chocolate cake. The meal was ok, but probably the service didn't help either. The waiter was very uninterested in us being there... And almost got off the feeling that he was doing us a favor. I personally tried to engage him, and be nice, but nothing.

Love the new location. Easy to get to and they have a parking lot! This sounds funny to some but not always a given in some of these hipster areas. We had been wanting to try Buffalo Cauliflower for a while and they had it on the menu. It was a huge portion that came out in a cast iron skillet. It tasted amazing! My wife is a life long Buffalo wing eater and she is from Buffalo to boot. We both agreed they were better than actual chicken wings. I took Kristen B. advise and our waitress on the Chimichanga. Everything about this dish was mouth watering from the main dish itself to the pickled onion side. I am still day dreaming about it. My wife decided on the Ramen Bowl. Great flavors. Loved the broth. Same problem with dessert. No room.   The wine wasn't the best deal for the amount and price. I however got the bourbon shrub. Which has been on my bucket list for a while and it was also fantastic! Lots of flavor.  I had two in fact.   Only down side was they didn't serve the Cucumber water like we remembered from the old location. My wife was bummed. LOL  Cant wait to go back.",

It is delicious. Every time we go, I contemplate getting something new, but thankfully I keep going back to the waffles and reminding myself how good they are. I did have the huevos rancheros with tofu before and was a fan the first time I had it, was less thrilled the second time, but now it doesn't matter...it's all tofu and waffles these days.

    "text": "Fern, Or Not ..Had very high hopes for this restaurant. I read all the Chef reviews in the paper , Must not be the same Chef now.  So we were a party of five , we ordered three appetizer Cauliflower Poutine, The Baked Gratin with Oatmeal Crumble and Tofu. Out of the three the Cauliflower Poutine was fairly good. Little tater totsmade out of Cauliflower and fake Cheese Curds...Not too bad. The Baked Gratin was not cooked correctly, the Butternut Squash was cooked but the turnip squash was hard, the crumble topping was not crispy... very odd. The Tofu was fine. Then I ordered the 200 year old Sourdough Flatbread-which is not flat and not bread..it is hard tack. It was described as having Scallop like Turnips and a Non-dairy bechamel sauce on it. Number they did not cut the  Turnips to look like scallops and the bechamel sauce was lacking any flavor at all.  Not any garnishes to make it a tasty flatbread lunch. Everything required more seasoning and flavor development, Nothing was even salted. My sister had the Buddha Bowl which had Black Forbidden Rice (undercooked)  and  large cubes of overcooked and undercooked vegetables. No seasoning again, and no beans as it was described to have them. Two of the others had the Warm Kale Salad, it was passable but not great.  My son ordered the OM burger it was missing flavor he said, like ordering a burger without  the burger !! We ordered Bloody Marys that had house made mix. It was nothing but watered down tomato juice with JUST horseradish. Not one garnish, or piece of lemon or a pickle or not a speck of pepper. Blah!!! and  7.00 dollars!!  All in all the place looks nice but should be a store and not a restaurant! I am so surprised at this Chefs craft. He needs to go back to the CIA and learn how to season and cook vegetables ---especially if this is his \"Vegetarian\"  Restaurant.. I will say I will not be going back at all.....",

    "text": "I'm not a vegetarian/vegan, but I try to do meat-free mondays and do veggie dishes when possible.  However I am sensitive to spice, so places that pile on heat to make up for taste are generally not going to work for me.  Fern started out promising - they don't carry cider or any sweet white wines that would suit the palate of a picky goof like me, but they do have some ($8!) juice blends.  (The blend tasted like 80% celery tho, not a great time).  Appetizers came out, and from the odd almond cheese, to bruschetta, to fried cauliflower, all was good.  I'd recommend the cauliflower or bruschetta to anyone, the cheese is a bit scarier.    However my big mistake was doing the Om Burger as my main course - with roasted tomatoes, avocado and goat cheese, sounded pretty rad.  I've done veggie burgers or garden burgers now and then, so I'm used to them being made of a mix of beans, soy, corn, whatever.  This burger...I knew on bite 1 that something was wrong.  Spiced cucumbers were on it so I removed them just in case, but with every bite came heat to the point of pain.  Knowing my own sensitivity I had my wife try a bite, since she is hispanic and more spice-friendly, but no good.  It felt like they added spice by the boatload to make up for lack of taste - not necessary when you have that much going on in a burger.    The burger came with the finger link potatoes, which some have described as crispy or salty, but mine were bland and mostly soft.  Not much browning or crispiness.    After this disappointing combination, we splurged on dessert - usually I wouldn't spend more money after this type of experience, but we were with friends and they were partaking.  They had what was basically a large ring ding, with peanut butter in the middle, drizzled with chocolate all around.  This...this was a good time.  If you are in the area and need a good dessert, that alone is worth the trip.  It's still highly priced for a dessert ($8) but easily feeds 2, so not a big problem.    I might come back if in need of apps/desserts, or if feeling adventurous down the veggie/vegan path again, but otherwise not.",

If you are a lover of bold/popping flavors- this is not your place. My fiance' and I have visited Fern on several occasions. Initially, a few years ago we came for breakfast, this was when they offered the green grits (which are no longer available). We've ordered their version of \"chicken n waffles\"; bland! The mock chicken was not seasoned properly. On another occasion we brought our parents and we all ordered their version of mac n cheese, with bbq ribs, and greens- NO! Again, very bland. We've tried to give them chance after chance but we will not be dining there again. With us being vegan, when visiting from out of town we didn't have a choice but we can no longer waste our money. If you are a lover of flavor, this would not be the ideal restaurant for you.",

    "text": "Not gonna lie, I don't dream about dining in veg-only restaurants often, or ever, but with a lunch date with my vegetarian sister on the books, I figured it was a good enough reason to try the place... I have to say I was very impressed.  We chose to sit outside and it was quite nice. The handful of iron chairs and wood-top tables scattered on wooden flooring made you forget you were yards from central avenue, until a train would come through. Lots of plant life, and they had a few heaters set up. We opted for the cucumber infused water (there were other bottled options) and started on the menu. We were give one which was simply drinks, the front half is freshly made juices and juice blends (all $6 - we opted for a lemonade/agave concoction) the back is beers and wines.   The food menu is the perfect length - just enough small plates, sandwiches, salads and entrees, with lots of daily changes (bruschetta, soup of the day, buddha bowl, cheese selections). They also have the items which are vegan or can be made vegan marked with little ferns, which I thought was clever. We couldn't pick, so we decided to split four of the small plates (but the table next to us had the OM burger and it looked amazing).  Squash blossom hush puppies - yummm. thank you kenny r. for the heads up. I wouldn't have known it was vegan cheese if it hadn't said so on the menu. So good, I didn't want to share. I enjoyed the onion \"butter\", my sister did not, luckily these pups stand perfectly well on their own.  The Indian Tacos - this, as a meat lover, was hands down my favorite dish. If I hadn't know any better I would have sworn up and down with the complex flavors they brought into the chili that I was eating something heartier than beans and squash. Mixed in with the lettuce and tomato and then sandwiched between a layer of the sharp cheddar on top and fried goodness underneath, holy crap, I'm sold.   The Envious Artichoke is the perfect light dish, stuffed with spinach and olives and topped with fried onions- we were very happy campers. On the other hand, the cannelloni added some serious weight to my stomach. Granted, it's a great fall flavor concoction of goat cheese goodness served over a sweet squash puree - but not the greatest choice for our fourth tasting dish.   Our service was top notch- water constantly filled, staff was very familiar with the menu, we were checked on just the right amount of times. Even though there isn't any meat on your menu, Fern, I'm a fan. (but seriously, get some new pens.)",

    "text": "Fern isn't just for vegetarians or vegans - it's for anyone who enjoys food that is artfully prepared with a lot of flavor. My hubby and I are both meat-eaters, but we found Fern to be wonderful.   All of the portions were large and shareable, and my hubby and I shared several dishes:  1) Jalapeno poppers - 5/5 - They did not have fresh squash available because of a recent cold snap, so they offered this as a substitute. These weren't your average jalapenos, either. They were HUGE, spicy, and delicious. I was afraid I would not care for the vegan mozzarella or vegan ranch dressing, but both were outstanding. I hope they keep these on the menu for a spicy alternative to the squash!  2) Kale salad with fried goat cheese - 5/5 - This was my hubby's favorite dish. The kale was served warm, with a light beet dressing, raisins, beets, and two large pieces of fried goat cheese. I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but I enjoyed the kale very much.  3) Artichokes with spinach - 3/5 - One large artichoke was halved and filled with spinach and roasted garlic. The spinach was delicious, but the artichokes were just messy and too hard to eat. I would not get this again.  4) Indian tacos - 5/5 - This was my favorite dish. I was amazed at the flavor of these bean and squash tacos served on homemade fry bread, topped with red onions, lettuce, and cheddar (not the vegan variety).   5) Apple cider sangria - 3/5 - These beverages were tasty, but light on the alcohol and high on price. At $9 each, we wished we had skipped this part of our order.  The cucumber water you also get is quite delicious and I'll just stick with that the next time.  6) Beer doughnuts with chocolate sauce - 4/5 - These fried dough balls were tasty, but a bit dense. The flavors were very good, though, and we cleaned the plate.  My only complaint about the food was that the prices are a bit high, and things really add up fast. (Our meal was $76 plus tip. That's a bit much for a meatless meal.) But, we did get a lot and the quality WAS outstanding.  Service was also outstanding - very attentive and helpful.   The decor was extremely tasteful and inventive. I especially loved the light fixture made of mason jars, and the wall of live greens. Seating was a bit tight, though, and my chair was bumped several times by the servers and patrons. You definitely need reservations for a weekend dinner, because the dining area is very small.   All in all, it was a good experience, and we plan to return.",

She had two tables reserved for all of us and she and the staff were top notch with tending to us, serving food and drinks in an incredibly timely manner, and checking up with us regularly.  This place was a pinch difficult to find at night. No lit up sign, the windows are covered with green curtains (so from outside it looks quite dim), The easiest way to navigate to it is to look across the street from Bistro La Bon (or two buildings over to the left from Slate).  The water here was really good. Not rubbishy tap water. It was filtered (or distilled?) and had a hint of cucumber to it-- quite lovely. I tried their special warm sangria: warm red wine, brandy, spices, and bits of apple and orange. Excellent for a chilly night.  I tried an Indian Taco (which I was confused about how it was Indian, aside from the naan shell... I got more of a chili-over-bread impression) and the Roasted Vegetable Panini with yellow squash and sun-dried tomatoes, and root veggie chips on the side. I think a more adventurous flavor could be placed in the panini-- and the store-bought ciabatta could be replaced with a house-made whole grain/sourdough or something. Anyhow, both were satisfying and pleasant but nothing to rant and rave about.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were very excited to drop by this new restaurant and was not disappointed!  Highlight: The bruschetta rocked my world in ways I did not know it could be rocked.  The Vibe: unique and welcoming. This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme.    The Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly!  The Food:   - Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)!   This aint no red paste/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread.  The only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future.  - Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry.   Whereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors.   - CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again!  - Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others.  Overall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food. There is a lot of variety  and unique flavors at Fern and I am not done exploring yet.",

The texture of the lightly fried patty is reminiscent of a perfect piece of falafel with a thin layer of crispiness adding a unique twist to the usual veggie burger fare.  The spices are perfect, with a unique blend of peppers and hickory, giving it a light BBQ flavor.  The roasted potatoes are also perfectly seasoned.    If this is what everyone is raving about, then I can certainly understand.  I will give Fern a third chance sometime to see if they deserve a higher rating, but for now I'd say they have redeemed themselves from a one star.",

I love their mason jar chandelier!   But the real treat is in their inventive menu, changed on a regular basis.  I have heard the OM burger is fantastic but I opted for the pot pie, but instead of chicken, there was lots of squash and mushrooms in a wonderfully flavorful gravy/sauce and instead of a pastry top or puff pastry (which I think is a travesty) was a deliciously crunchy croissant that was perfect to dip into the pot pie. It was a dinner party in my mouth and definitely crave worthy. I could have it weekly.   My sister in law got the wild mushroom risotto which was tasty, but definitely more of a rice bowl than risotto. It lacked the typical creaminess of regular risotto but was surely more healthy because it was made with brown rice.    Their service was fantastic and friendly as well.   I was shocked to hear that it was the same ownership as Something Classic which for me is hit and a big miss, but not as surprised to hear it's the same as Halcyon at the Mint. Apparently it's tough to get in for dinner, so I really look forward to making this a regular lunch gathering spot and trying dessert. Hooray Fern!",

Loved the setting of fern and we loved the cucumber water also. Our server was one of the guys and he had his nails painted (no judgement just forgot his name) he was incredibly mean. We ate here because a friend of mine is a vegan so it was perfect for us. She heard there were specials so when she asked him he rolled his eyes and said we don't have specials and she said well what about the specials that change everyday...rolled his eyes again and had the one female server read us them. Every Time he came back to our table he would slam things down on the table and just act generally annoyed with us being there. He also tried to charge us extra for our beers. My husband asked to take home his salad and quinoa and the server only packed up the quinoa and threw out the salad. A bad server can really mess up a cool place. Not sure we'll be back. Maybe take out for two orders of the cauliflower.",

Fast and friendly service, great pricing, and the juice and salad were fabulous. The restaurant is comfortable and cute, clean, and has great ambience. Looking forward to hitting this place again when I'm back in Charlotte.",

I went for brunch and ordered the 'Chicken' and Waffles. The waffles are made of sweet potato glazed with warm maple syrup and topped with the 'chicken', which is tofu breaded like real fried chicken with a bit of a spicy zing leaving your mouth watering for more is placed on top. Parking is limited, they don't take reservations and the wait is pretty long if you don't get there before the typical meal rush hours.",

It's nice to be able to eat out at a restaurant where you know that a lot (if not most) of their food is locally grown, organic and just plain delicious!! Staff is friendly and enthusiastic about what they have to offer. If you can, make a reservation...the place is fairly small and fills up quickly.  The cucumber-infused water is one of my favorites!!",

I'd happily pay $8 for a juice smoothie that healthy and good.  And bless them, they made me love Kale Chips.  Both my husband and I had the Spinach Fritata with marinated Tofu.. really freakin' good.  Cucumber water... mmmm.... made me so happy this place did.",

I am a huge fan of Fern and all the delicious yummy veggies they have to offer. The chef is a master at taking veggies and vegan cuisine to a whole new level. I still dream of the vegan mac and cheese I got on my first visit. This time I tried out the juices (so cleansing), the ramen, and the OM burger with avocado. All were delicious and flavorful. But for the second time I got the cauliflower poutine and man does it dress to impress with flavor! I absolutely love this dish and am always tempted to lick the bowl, but figure it is not polite. The staff is always very pleasant! Down to the very cucumber water that is served, everything at Fern is tasty and delicious! Can't wait to return to try more!",

The tempeh schnitzel was a fun riff on the meat version: I am tempted to try to make it at home!  It was gratifying to  find a vegetarian restaurant using strong technique.",

Menu is hard to find on the website (it's above the brunch menu) but once you find it go get the Om burger. So delicious! I got it with the kale chips and it was a good decision. I can't wait to try more from Fern. Next time I will go and sit down because the atmosphere is awesome.",

The menu descriptions are fantastic, and I should've gone for the Buddha Bowl, but instead I was lured by the sound of mushroom bacon. Disappointed, which should surprise no one (but me). Similar ehs from everyone around the table. I tried to spice things up with the housemade hot sauce, but that wasn't even hot, just salty. I loved the service, knowledgeable staff and friendly, cozy vibe. But I won't be going back for the food.",
