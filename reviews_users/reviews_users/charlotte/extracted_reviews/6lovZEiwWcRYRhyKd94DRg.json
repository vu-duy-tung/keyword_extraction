    "text": "Have been wanting to try Smashburger for a while.  My husband, son and I finally made it down to Stonecrest.  Now, I went into Smashburger with a bias for another burger place, BT's Burger Joint.  Have loved that place and we were willing to drive to Steele Creek for the burgers.  Well, after trying the Smashmouth Mushroom Swiss Burger, I am now a convert.  Perfectly grilled, juicy, just enough mushrooms that they were not littering the basket and on an awesome, fresh egg bun.  Sorry BT's.  We've found a place that is closer to home that has superior burgers!!  Of course, this was our first time and I will need to try other items on the menu, but we will definitely be back.  The fries were so-so.  Were told to try the seasoned fries next time and will.  Not a fan of the parking situation, however.  But some things you have to deal with.  In total.  Great burgers!",

    "text": "Delicious burgers and chicken sandwiches, a wedge salad that rivals some fine dining establishments, and delicious milkshakes - what more could you want? Smashburger is considered \"fast-casual\" - order and pay at the front, grab a number, and wait for the food to come to you. With four small children, this approach is a must for us.   Smashburger officially opens on Monday, but my husband and I and our tawdry assortment of children had the opportunity to grab a quick bite there today. I wasn't sure what to expect - I have had less than pleasant experiences with other \"fast-casual\" restaurants in the Charlotte area, so I was trying not to get my hopes up - little did I know what deliciousness awaited me! Smashburger reminds me of a similar place that my kids used to love in Cleveland - Fatburger. Whenever a burger and milkshake craving would strike, we would pile in the car and head to Fatburger. Certainly not a weekly visit, but a reliable go-to place that always hits the spot. (Don't tell my Cleveland friends, but I can safely say that Smashburger is better... shhh...)  When six people eat out together, there is a beautiful opportunity to try a little bit of everything. My must-try food is always fried pickles and these were great - crunchy dill slices with ranch dressing - maybe just a little on the too-salty side. My son is an onion ring afficionado (Smashburger has onion straws - light and crispy), my older daughter is a french fry girl and the youngest two will grab whatever comes in front of them! My husband ordered the mushroom swiss burger, I tried the cheddar bbq - both were great. Not too big - I enjoyed the burger and the amazing smash fries that I ordered with it. (Smash fries are lightly seasoned with salt and rosemary - yum - try them.) My son wanted a chicken sandwich and he tried the club - the chicken breast was really, really thin. He devoured it but I was able to sneak a bite in, it was very tasty. My daughter always orders a salad and I really couldn't believe how beautiful the side wedge salad was - and it was on the side menu for $2.99. Wow.    We left satiated and cannot wait to come back! We had a tiny taste of the milkshakes but I look forward to enjoying a large one when we return. The butterfinger milkshake will be calling my name next time... I recommend you check out Smashburger - I think you will love it!",

    "text": "This review is based on 3 separate visits, all dine-in.  Food: I ordered the Carolina, Classic, and Chicago burgers, one for each visit. The burger itself is a bit too greasy, and over-salted.The burger patty is oversized in diameter for the bun, making the burger extremely sloppy and messy to eat. The taste was average, with the Carolina burger being the most interesting and flavorful. The fries were interesting and moderately tasty, but not extraordinary.   Price: The price was somewhat higher than the direct competition, and overpriced for the quality of the food.   Cleanliness: The restaurant was relatively clean, although finding a clean table was a challenge on all three visits. The place is brightly colored and lit,with a slight retro 50's psuedo-west coast vibe.  Service: Service is, for want of a better word, terrible. The level of apathy displayed by the employees (including the managers) approaches the level of t.v. sitcom cliche. It's so pervasive they should just incorporate it into the smashburger theme. The service was bad on all 3 visits.  Overall: I was excited to have another burger joint in Ballantyne, but overall Smashburger is a disappointment. The price is too high for average food with poor service. There are 2 Five Guys in the area, I would definitely recommend them over Smashburger; they have a better product, cleaner restaurant, lower prices, and employee who at least pretend to care.",

    "text": "Smashburger certainly makes a tasty burger, though some of there other items wander a bit off point. I too was fortunate enough to get invited to the Sneak Peak event. I ordered the Spicy Baja burger, which comes with pepperjack, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle  mayo, jalapenos and guac (which I subbed out for garlic mushrooms), all served on a spicy chipotle bun.  My first reaction was that everything had great flavor. I really enjoyed the combination of fresh and creamy ingredients. I ordered the rosemary, olive oil Sweet Potato Smashfries and while they were quite strong on the rosemary I still enjoyed them.  Had I stopped there I would have given Smashburger 4 stars, no problem, and if you are just going to eat a meal that is probably what you will experience, but our table was given several other items to try. I guess they were trying to make sure we got a taste of the whole menu. The Brunswick fries were very salty and I wasn't crazy about them at all. The Harvest Salad was good, but it is heavily dressed and the blue cheese could use more kick (I thought it was goat cheese until I was corrected). I skipped the Chicken Avocado Club sandwich since I don't eat avocado or bacon and it had both. The Carolina Burger, which sports Pimina cheese, BBQ sauce and onion slaw, originally had me wary but it was tastier than I expected. I'm not sure I would enjoy a whole one as much as my order, but I would certainly split one with someone. There is no nice way to say that the Haystack Onions looked like someone dumped a can of French's on a plate, but the horseradish  sauce that came with them was pretty good. All of this was topped off with milkshakes and I don't have a bad word to say about those. They use Haagen-Dazs so it's pretty much luxury in a glass.  I think what it boils down to is that if I were going to catch a movie and needed to grab a meal (cause let's face it, I have no other reason to be that far down in south Charlotte) I would be more than happy to stop at Smashburger. I liked the things I picked (and some of the others) and I'd want to eat them again.",

After carefully perusing the menu I chose the BBQ, Bacon and Cheddar burger and a side of Smashfries. Let's start with the burger. To be honest, I was expecting more. The beef patty was quite thin and very greasy for $6. The barbecue sauce, bacon and cheddar added flavor which helped to improve the dining experience.  I am truly sorry to say that it was downhill from the burger. The fries were just bad. For $2 you get the equivalent of a McDonalds medium size fries (I am being generous). They were crisp, but had very little flavor. I almost always enjoy my fries sans ketchup, but had to resort to the tomato based condiment to get some of the Smashfries down.  Since I usually follow the 3-strikes rule, I will probably give Smashbuger another shot. Who knows?  Maybe I can do a better job of item selection from the vast menu.",

After spending over $10 on a Classic with a side of fries (the Smashburger ones), I had really expected a better overall experience.  The burger was overcooked (I had ordered medium rare), incredibly salty, and void of any real flavor.  There was too much ketchup and mustard.  The huge tomato was sliced too thickly and was not all ripe.  The single wilted piece of lettuce helped the whole ensemble slide around while attempting to eat this monstracity.  On a final note, the cheese melted into a goo that conjured up memories of the cheese you'd get on movie theater nachos.  Oh and let me not forgot to mention the fries - shoestring, greasy, and not at all satisfying.  Honestly I've had better burgers and fries at McDonalds (in which I'm no fan).

    "text": "This is a restaurant where I really wish I could give a half star--it's a 4.5 star burger place. Located right near the fountain at Stonecrest, Smashburger is in a great location. On Fridays and Saturdays from 7-10, you're treated to live music outside (only in the summer). Decor inside is very modern and minimalistic, but it has a nice vibe to it that says 21st century.  The food is really good--the burgers are delicious and the toppings are even better. I get the Carolina Burger, which is a patty with cole slaw, barbecue sauce, and pimento cheese. Delicious burger. The fries (I think I just ordered \"fries\" instead of \"Smashfries\" were okay, kind of like the one's you'd find at McDonalds. Eh, kind of a disappointment. My dad got a grilled chicken sandwich, and reported the grilled chicken was very good as well.  You can usually get a coupon for this place if you like them on Facebook or join their email list. Overall, smashburger delivers a smashing burger with lacking fries. Next time I try the Smashfries, I'll update the review.  EDIT: Took Carolina Burger off the menu. -1 star.",

This salad includes a mix of greens -including spinach, along with tomatoes, raisins, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and blue cheese crumbles.  It is served with a  balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I also added grilled chicken to it.  Something gave the salad a saltly flavor - not sure whether it was the salad dressing, the chicken breast, or the blue cheese crumbles but it  detracted from my enjoyment of the salad. I am not sure what it is about Smashburger, but they seem to make everything a little too salty for my preference.  David got an order of Smashfries tonight and I thought those tasted a little too salty as well.  Each time I come here, I want to really like this place, but its just \"ok\" not great.",

There shirts should be long enough to cover themselves. This isn't hooters! One female there cant even crack a smile when you place your order at the register. She has no personality no manners!

I don't know if I was just really hungry or if all the other times were off nights. However definitely a big improvement.  I however can only give them one more star because the service was just insanely bad!! I called in my order and not even two minutes later walked in to pay for it.  They had no recollection or record of the order. Seriously it was like 70 seconds??  The  manager just kind of stood around like he didn't even work there.

    "text": "Smashburger, located at the front of Stonecrest right next to Miro (near Marble Slab and Dean & Deluca), is fine.  It was meh, but A-OK.  There was nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't great either.    Going along with the recent boom in burger joints in the area, Smashburger is another burger/dog/chicken/fries/shakes place where everything is a la carte.  You grab a menu on the way in, wait in line to order, are given a number to stick on your table and then you head to find seating.  They will also hunt you down outside if the weather permits eating in the courtyard - nice, eh?    On a Monday night visit around 6:00 pm, the place was hopping.  Not crazy, but at capacity when I arrived.  Loud, very very loud.  The floor-space with carpeting does not absorb enough sound to make up for the exposed ceiling.  With the milkshake machine going and the kids squealing, it is deafening in there.  Even as it started to empty out, the hum of the movements of the few left still made for a loud restaurant.    The food: Chili-cheese dog $5 -  It was fine.  Nothing special.  The hot dog is butterflied and served with mediocre chili and topped with shredded cheese.  Meh.  Totally not worth $5. Sweet potato fries $3 - The fries were pretty good.  Slightly thicker than shoestring, with a soft interior and a crunchy exterior.  Lightly salted.  The portion size probably equated to just slightly smaller than a McD's large fry. Fried pickles served w/ ranch $3.29 - Meh.  Definitely not the best I have had, not big on flavor, ranch was boring.  They were fried nicely and the batter didn't fall off of the pickle chips, so points for that.    Employees were all very nice and helpful.  The space was kept clean, even as busy as it was.  The guy on the milkshake machine was tearing it up delivering the creamy goodness to a restaurant full of folks.  Dinner with a drink was just over $13.  Nothing was fabulous.  I didn't get sick, but I won't be rushing back to the Smashburger.",

Smashburger has been on my list of places to try from the menu and the concept it seems like a place I would really enjoy!  I wish they would have had a turkey burger...since those are my absolute favorites but instead I chose the Spicy Black Bean Burger. It's loaded with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes and chipotle mayo....I could have used some added jalapenos for an extra kick but the sandwich was still awesome! I love the fresh beans and veggie mix they used to make the patty and the the chipotle bun was heavenly!   I added the smash fries with have oil and rosemary and they were a perfect pairing for the burger....everything came out HOT and fresh and I enjoyed every bite!  The experience overall was very welcoming and I loved the decor....I look forward to coming back!",

City Tavern is right across the street and has a much better burger and fries, on Monday you can even get it for $5.  Also the booths are sized completely wrong, make you feel like a 5yr old.",

Ask and I received; I ordered the Big Carolina Chili Burger w/ Smash Fries. The food was good and the smash fries were extra excellent with nice flavor. Nice modern feel and very clean although it was pretty empty on a Monday at 5pm. I could imagine what it is like on the weekend with the movie theater practically next door. My only complaint was the annoyance of a nasty fly roaming about annoying my family and I. It would also be good to put some combos up on the menu rather then ordering a burger and fries separate and a bigger kids menu would be appreciated.",

    "text": "Smashburger has now arrived in Charlotte, NC. Located in the Stonecrest shopping center, Smashburger is the latest addition to Charlotte's ever growing restaurant scene. I was invited to the Smashburger pre-grand opening event to sample some of the delicious food now being offered in south Charlotte.  When my girlfriend and I arrived for the pre-grand opening event we were greeted at the front door by a staff of friendly people just waiting to show off the great food they had to offer. We were told to try anything on the menu and order as much as we would like too because everything would be free and they wanted us to try as much as wewanted  I don't think there is anything I love more than FREE FOOD!!!! We decided to try the BBQ Ranch Chicken Sandwich, the Carolina Burger, the Smashfries, the Sweet Potato Fries, the Fried Pickles, the Brunswick Fries, two IBC bottled root beers and five different shake samples. I know, I know... that's alot of food... but it was free!!!! So I couldn't resist    The BBQ Chicken Sandwich was amazing! Complete with Crispy or Grilled Chicken, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Haystack Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, BBQ Sauce and Ranch Dressing on an egg bun... the BBQ Chicken Sandwich at Smashburger was one of my favorite Chicken Sandwich's anywhere and the easiest recommendation I can give for Smashburger.  The Brunswick Fries had mixed opinions throughout their Charlotte debut. Some people didn't like them.. some said they were ok... but I liked them. They reminded my alot of an upgraded version of Backyard Burgers Chili Cheese Fries. The menu described the Brunswick Fries as being Smashfries with Brunswick stew and shredded cheese over top. I didn't taste any Brunswick stew on the fries... but what I did taste was pulled pork with a little bit of corn mixed in over top of crispy fries and topped with shredded cheese. I thought the Brunswick Fries were delicious and despite the mixed feeling at their debut, I would recommend them.  The Carolina Burger is something unique to this location and not offered anywhere else. Made with Pimina Cheese, BBQ Sauce and Vidalia Onion BBQ Slaw on an Egg Bun, the Smashburger Carolina Burger was unlike any other Carolina Burger I have ever had. The Pimina Cheese oozed out of the sides and the Vidalia Onion BBQ Slaw covered a delicious 100% Angus Beef Patty. The Smashburger Carolina Burger was delicious and an easy recommendation.  The Fried Pickles were thick cut dill pickles, battered and deep fried served with buttermilk ranch dressing. They tasted alot like the fried pickles you get at Macs Speed Shop, which are of course amazing. I prefer really thin cut fried pickles... so they weren't my favorite... but that's just a personal preference. If you like thick cut fried pickles, Smashburger makes exactly what you are looking for!  The Sweet Potato Smashfries and the original Smashfries were well above your average french fries. Tossed in rosemary, olive oil and garlic, the Smashfries make for the perfect companion to any burger and sandwich at Smashburger. Drench them in either the buttermilk ranch or cover them in ketchup and mustard, either way you cant go wrong with Smashfries!  While eating the mega banquet laid out in front of us, the staff also walked around with samples of the many flavors of Haagan-Dazs milkshakes that Smashburger also offers.  We tried the Nutterbutter, the Reeses, the Strawberry, the Vanilla and the Banana Pudding Milkshakes. Every one of them were amazing and should accompany anything you order when going to Smashburger. My favorite however, was the nutterbutter milkshake!!!  There are plenty of other burger options around Charlotte, but none has to offer what Smashburger does. I welcome Smashburger to south Charlotte and look forward to seeing them grow in our city. If you are in the area and are looking to try something new, stop by the Stonecrest shopping center and try out the newest burger joint in Charlotte",

Take Five Guys, add chicken and veggie patties as options, and update the toppings and sauces to include the coveted avocado and a spicy chipotle mayo (which was delicious once I convinced myself to forget how gross mayonaisse is).  A variety of sides includes something for everyone, like fried pickles, salads, and the \"smashfries\" in regular and sweet potato varietals. Topped with rosemary and salt, these greasy bad boys won the prize for the night.  The black-bean patty was quite tasty and the multigrain bun wasn't too dry.   I'd probably return for another visit, but not unless I were already in the area.",

The favorite part is the smash fries, golden brown and super crispy, and tossed in garlic and what i think is rosemary. addictive.

It was pretty good but because of the texture/size, I  really ended up with more bread in my mouth than anything.  Husband liked his burger but it was just okay.  Nothing great. Sweet potato fries were tasty.  The place was packed!  Nice quick meal option I suppose.  They didn't gain a new loyal fan right off the bat but I would revisit in a pinch.",

The woman at the counter look at me like I had just asked her the square root of 247258.  After her confused look, I acquiesced.  I also ordered the smashburger fries.  We grabbed a seat and the food came out relatively quickly.  My burger looked good but I was given regular fries instead of the Smashburger fries.  I didn't realize until I felt like it was too late to say something.  Someone else in our party didn't get the right type of fries also.  The plain fries were very bad and desperately needed some sort of seasoning.  The burger was ok but I thought mine was really dry.  I'll pass on Smashburger in the future.",

Service is super fast and everyone has been friendly to me after already going a couple dozen times (too much maybe?).

Burger 21 is a better deal and a better burger and Bad Daddys, while noisy and not inexpensive, is a far better burger. No more Smashburger visits for me.",

Another big change, they changed their fries.  The smashfries recipe is still the same, but the actual fries have changed, which changes the flavors.  I do not like the new fries.  I don't get why so many companies change what works and what people have come to love.  Maybe because they can get a better price with things, but these changes come at the expense of the customer.  We will now not likely go and will go try other burger places, such a big disappointment Smashburger.",

I created my own burger - a quarter pounder with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, grilled onions, and jalepenos - and it ended up being a solid burger.  The meat was tasty, and the buns were nice and lightly browned.  I also had the rosemary tossed fries, which were the highlight of the meal, in my opinion.  They had a crispy exterior and a soft center - the way good fries ought to be.  And I enjoyed the flavor of the rosemary with it.    I've definitely had better burgers, but I'd come back to smashburger without having to think too hard about it.",

The slaw on the burger is made with Duke's Mayonnaise which is another southern favorite.  The burger was great but a little salty, the pretzel roll did not disappoint.  It just fell apart to easy.  But overall with a little mustard added, this was a good choice.  I also ordered fries.  They were forgettable.  About the same texture as McDonald's fries but not nearly as good.    Service was good here.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  I might have to give them another try.  But with so many burger joints in town, it is going to be difficult to get back here.",

But, the place was jam packed. Lots of families (which we like, since having a toddler can sometimes be a challenge with dining in public). Soda station was clean and stocked, food came out fast and HOT - that's a plus for sure. Staff are young teens who seem slightly uninterested, but that's fine, they're simply dropping and running food anyway. I ordered the avocado chicken ranch sandwich and I've never seen a chicken breast so thin, but I'm not complaining, it was still pretty darn tasty - and the fries, mmmmmmmm......... The fries. We'll be back, just maybe not on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Doesn't hurt that cold stone is across the way for a \"light\" dessert!",

Be prepared to wash your hands both before and after your meal here.  Even an unadorned burger is juicy and if you don't hold it over your tray you will need a dry cleaning trip for sure.  Delicious beef, tastes like a hamburger should.  They have a number of suggested burger toppings and combinations but don't feel pressed to pick any but what you like.  You can pick what you want and it will be cooked and prepared to your order.  Some toppings are beyond the regular, like spinach, so you have more choices than at other burger joints.  Fries (regular and sweet potato) are good, thin and you get a good portion.    Mondays are free milkshake days, so you get a FREE milkshake when you order a meal.  A very good deal and the shakes are wonderful.  Iced tea in three varieties are available at the drink bar along with fountain sodas.  Order at the counter, get a number, proceed to the drink bar and then to a table to await service of your order.  Very efficient.  Outside seating is available in a small courtyard and the tables have napkins, ketchup and mustard.  Can be crowded at peak hours, so be prepared or come outside of peak.  I think the prices are a bit high, but for the options you have can accept the prices as they are.",

I think I could've had more out on it, but I didn't want to try my luck with a burger that topples over to the point where it isn't a burger anymore. My philosophy: it's okay for mission burritos, no good for burgers on overloading condiments.   This place was a quick meal with a good amount of seating. With a feel of old school dining mixed in with the new. Pick up a menu, go to the counter, order, and sit down for your masterpiece (or a default burger) to come greet your burger cravings.   Overall, this place is worth looking into if you're into burgers and a little freedom as far as creating what you want to taste. This place will be on my list if I'm in town and looking for a burger.",

Meanwhile everyone else had finished their meal. Puddle of liquid in the hot dog container - watery grease, urine?  I don't know. Burgers (three out of four) were not centered on the bun.  Sound nitpicky? Basically needed a shower afterwards.  Seriously, their burgers are not great, their prices are not competitive, their service is poor.  Lesson learned for me: Be desperate for disappointment if I ever want to go back.",

    "text": "Smashburger serves up some juicy burgers and tasty fries, but the availability of much better burgers makes Smashburger a place not worth visiting.  FOOD Smashburger features the standard option of several burgers, the ability to custom make burgers, fries, and shakes. There are also several side and appetizer options. The food tastes good, but the menu is completely uninspiring. The pre-designed burgers are nothing special, just the standard varieties that you've seen just about everywhere else. The toppings for custom-made burgers are nothing out of the ordinary either. C'mon, people, offer something unique. Give me a reason to come here instead of other burger places.  I will give Smashburger kudos for their buns, which are slightly chewy and much better than the dry mess most places use, but, please, offer some unique toppings, a rotating \"burger of the day\", some unique or rotating sides, etc. When choosing a burger place to go to, there are just too many other choices to warrant a repeat visit to Smashburger.  PRICE I absolutely cannot stand burger places that feature everything a la carte. Fries and a drink should always come with a burger. I just do not understand how $15 for a burger meal is acceptable.  SERVICE You place your order and pay at the counter, they bring the burger to you, and you're responsible for refilling your own drink. Not much to say here.  Overall, Smashburger is \"just another burger chain\". It is much better than the fast food alternatives, but in a crowded field of local burger eateries, many of whom offer very unique burgers priced accordingly, Smashburger just does not stand out and offers no reason to visit.",

    "text": "Not sure why this place isn't rated that high... solid place to get a burger and their milkshakes are killer too (They use haagen daz so they're super creamy). For non-burger lovers like me, their smashchicken is yummy as well (and yes, it is  a piece of chicken that has been smashed.) It's the same topping options for both. I always get the spinach, cucumber and goat cheese, which also has tomato, onion, and balsamic vinaigrette drizzled on top. I'd say this is the healthiest option but it doesn't taste super healthy at all because the goat cheese gives it a nice creaminess. I just get it mainly for the goat cheese tbh.  People say their fries aren't good but I recommend trying their fries that are mixed with olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. They're the skinny kind that are slightly crispy but chewy at the same time. A bit pricey, yes, but I have yet to be disappointed. It's a good takeout option too since they're very speedy at bringing your food out.",

Staff present in the store are not even responding back to me properly bcaz they might thought that I will reach out to the corporate headquarters. Also they told me this was only retail store which don't accept the coupons, where they got instructed to do by that franchise owner. My sincere suggestion to all valued customers is not to stop by such kind of False business.",

My black bean burger looked like smashed green and blue playdoh painted black and had too much salt on it to even eat. On top of that the goat cheese on my spinach and goat cheese burger was literally the size of a penny. Maybe they should spend less money on fancy Coke machines and little smash burger flags through the middle of your burger and a little more money on meat.

Definitely a good fit for the Stonecrest shopping center to have a fast casual option to go between the fast and sit down options this shopping center offers.  Staff are friendly and the food comes out pretty quick.  The burgers are filling but you don't feel like you automatically go into a food comma right away.  Don't get me wrong, you can definitely set yourself up for that if you double and triple your patty and load up on toppings.  The patties are definitely \"smashed\" as they are cooked, but it gives it more of a unique shape and equal cook on either side.  The dining room has a mixture of booths and tables... the tables can easily be pushed together for larger groups.  Small outdoor patio with a couple tables that looks out to the main courtyard and the ice cream place across the way.",

Walking into Smashburger, my expectations were very high. They were busy and I've heard good things from them. I ordered the BBQ, Bacon & Cheddar burger. I'm a sucker for bacon so as soon as I saw that word, I couldn't look at anything else. For a side, I ordered the regular Tots. For my beverage, I went with a classic vanilla shake.   The staff was nice and the service was quick. Good so far. The burger on the other hand, was kind of on the skinny side. It reminded me of Steak n Shake in the size department, but it was more expensive. The burger was cooked well, but the bacon was a little flimsy and not crisp how it should be. I took one bite of the bacon and the entire piece slid into my mouth and it was hard to bite off as it was a little chewy. The crispy onions weren't very crispy either. The overall flavor of the hamburger was good and the BBQ sauce wasn't overpowering.   The regular tots were, well, just regular. Nothing to really talk about here, as they tasted like the ones you would get in a school cafeteria. I've had better frozen ones from the grocery store.   The shake. It came in a small cup, which almost half of that seemed like whipped cream. I felt let down, since the picture on the menu had a glass like the ones you would get at a diner. Not to mention I had several large ice chunks in my cup.   I can't help but to feel very disappointed about my visit. I was left wanting more from a place that is raved about by many. At this point, I can't say that I will be back. Nothing there had me feeling like I needed to have it again. For the price, I'd rather go to Steak n Shake. Which isn't saying very much.",

The BBQ sauce came on the side with the burger, I'm not sure why, but the burger was pretty good. The milkshake was excellent. Staff did not seem too sure of what options were available, as if they were in training.

A couple of months ago I had the worst experience ever from that stupid milkshake. I got one, and it had the worst aftertaste. I couldn't pin point it but tasted so weird. Like spoiled milk. But I hadn't eaten all day and I was starving so I drank most of it. Fast forward 20 minutes when I couldn't stop throwing up and the only thing I had all day was that milkshake from hell.  Every time I'm in that location, I always see the milk sitting out. I alway assumed it was because they went through it so much that they didn't really bother to put it away. I don't know and I never really cared until that day.  I sent smashburger a feedback email, because as it turns out, I got food poisoning. Literally the only thing I ate was the milkshake. They did not reach out to me or respond at all! So I have boycotted it and I tell everyone this story. Only come here if you want to get food poisoning. Maybe you want to lose a little weight for the new year, smashburger is the place for you!   I realize this review is a little harsh, but maybe if they had responded to my email than I wouldn't have cared so much. After a month or two of no response, I forwarded the same email to them. Still no response. They really don't care about their consumers so I am no longer a consumer for them. Never coming back again.",

    "text": "Ok, so let me tell you why I'm giving this place 5 stars! One, is because I have eaten here 32 times since the Smashpass I purchased went into effect. I purchased a smashpass that entitles me to an entree a day for 100 days for $100.00. It started November 5th, and ends in mid February. I've had every item on the menu except the Brunswick stew and Brussel sprouts, most more than once. I've tried the beef patty, crispy chicken patty, grilled chicken patty and the turkey burger, the only thing I have to try is the black bean burger. I've never had any issues with the food, my food has always been right, hot, cooked properly and I've been served with a smile. When I make special requests for packaging it up, extra onions, stuff on the side, they oblige me. I don't like when they put the burger in the paper because it can get squished and sloppy so they give me a box when I ask. I even started a 100 day Smashburger challenge on my youtube channel (Angela Anagho TV)  documenting each day that I go there, what I got, how I may have embellished the burger at home and it's been so much fun. My favorites are the bacon avocado club, the baja jalapeno burger, the triple double and the smash fries.  Now, some days I've given the food to my hubby or kids and my husband absolutely loves the mushroom swiss burger with truffle mayo, I prefer the truffle mayo on the side because the taste can be a bit overpowering otherwise. My teen daughters love, love, love the cobb salad and has replaced their former favorite salad at Chop't.  It's really good and you don't even need to add a protein which can be added for an additional charge, it's good as is. The salted caramel and mint chocolate shakes are really creamy and the perfect thickness and they are smart enough to include a spoon with your straw. I don't regret buying the Smashpass and I am very pleased with the food and service. They have disappointed me yet. I have 66 more days to go! And I'll still come here after my pass has expired.  That is all!",

I guess I was right because I loved it. This isn't a fine dining burger joint but it was a great drive by spot. Fun burgers to choose from, delish milk shakes and fries... I'm down for that ANYDAY.  It's family friendly for dinner. The staff was pretty young, didn't care much about the customer experience. Don't get me wrong they were nice but nothing that stood out as fantastic.  The bathrooms were clean, so that a plus.  We will absolutely go back here, it was a nice night out without spending a fortune. I can't wait to try another burger.... until next time Smashburger. We will see you soon :)",

    "text": "I recently heard someone mention Smashburger and I was curious to give them a try. I was actually really pleased with the burger I ordered the Classic Smash and it was delicious. I also switched up the order a bit; I asked for grilled onion instead of the raw onions and added mushrooms. Let me take a minute and tell you how bomb this burger was..... YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!! The burger had a charcoaled taste so it kind of reminded me of a burger straight off the grill at a cookout or something. I also ordered the French Fries but now looking over the menu I'm sad I didn't try the SmashFries (which are tossed in rosemary, garlic and olive oil) that sounds delicious. I still can't take away from the regular French Fries because they were good. I was a little upset when I reached in my bag and there were no fries left *sad face*. I can't believe I ate them that quick!!  Now for the setup, you walk in they give you instructions on 1) grabbing a menu, 2) to not get to excited about the menu choices (cute; this made me laugh), 3) then telling us to put the menu back when we're ready to order! I didn't really like that because it kind of gave me a bit of anxiety thinking I was going to miss something I wanted. Hence the fact, I definitely missed the SmashFries! Granted there was a menu at the register which I didn't see at first because I was looking up for it but it was right below the cash register. The cashier wasn't very helpful either I again felt rushed and as if she was a little annoyed. But the food made up for the experience.",

However, the burger, the reason why I came in for, was awesome!  Strong beef taste and a great bun. For that reason, I will come back.   It's ok to greet people with a smile. Just saying. ",

    "text": "There are scads of his burger joints in the area but Smashburger was one of the first and has consistently served up fresh and delicious Angus burgers since its introduction several years back. Their simple menu also includes smashed chicken sandwiches and tasty salads. Everything is made to order and is delivered piping hot by eager servers after being paid for at the counter. Both customer service and management have always been attentive during my many visits.  Their addictive shoe string fries are available three ways: Regular, olive oil and sweet potato. Serving sizes are generous. Although delicious, one drawback to thin shoe string fries is that they don't hold heat very well so, if yours do not arrive piping hot, simply notify your server and they will gladly provide a replacement and an apology. They aim to please!  One warning about the burgers... they are incredibly juicy and messy (in a good way) so be prepared to use a lot of napkins that are provided along with condiments at your table. I've never had a bad one at this location. Pricewise they are on par with other comparable burger joints.  My favorite menu item isn't even a burger. Instead chicken, spinach & goat cheese sandwich.  The chicken, like the burgers, is smashed and the goat cheese is piled on. Yum!  Oh yeah, almost forgot, they also have hand spun Haagen-Dazs milkshakes on the menu! They are pricey but go on Milkshake Mondays and you get a free one with your meal. Use caution however as you will leave beyond completely stuffed. Otherwise, the usual beverages are are offered at the self-service station.  Seating is available inside and out. Be sure to get there early at peak times as the joint is always crowded. The fact that I have never had anything other than good experiences here over dozens of visits leads me to give it an easy 4 stars, but again, there are many excellent comparable alternatives nearby. I like most of them.",

The burger tastes like no other burger I've had, and I can't say it's a good different. I do like the variety and choices you get. Mushrooms, pretzel bun, olive seasoned fries. Great shakes. Although I found it odd they had banana pudding shakes listed on the web site but it wasn't available in the store. I've had Smashburger three times in my life, and it's always been because of other people. I never go on my own, and tend to avoid them because the taste.  The physical store needs work. I look at cleanliness, and find this location to be one of the worse restaurants I've been to. Dust and bugs are very visible. The giant \"SMASH\" sign on the wall has dust on the letters. And not on top of the letters, on the side. Don't look up or you will see this dust on lights, light shades and signage.",

I've driven by this location at Stonecrest so many times in the past year, so I decided to give it a shot. Overall it is ok. I got the Carolina Chili Burger. While I'm happy to find a place that doesn't put mustard on it, overall it was just all right. The messy burger proved too much for the wire basket it's served in, so a lot got on the table. I don't remember exactly what my wife ordered - a baja spicy burger, or something like that. She had the same response. It was ok. The fries are of the shoestring variety, which is not my favorite. Unless you're a big eater, I recommend splitting the fries. I wouldn't have been able to finish a whole order alone, so splitting saved us some money. Again, Smashburger is pretty good. It's not going to blow you away, but it is quick and convenient. I would place it somewhere between a sit-down, order, and have a server bring you food type of restaurant and a fast food place - which I think is what it is aiming for (fast casual?). A good place if you want something relatively inexpensive and quick between shopping or just before a movie.",

The decor is very minimalistic, that's okay it's a pretty casual burger joint and I was meeting a friend here for lunch so I'm not expecting much ambiance or else something has gone terribly wrong.  So you saunter up to that counter and you have a couple of choices for burgers. I chose the classic with veggie frites cause those sounded pretty cool. Well the burger's the most decent burger I've ever had. It was filling and unmemorable, well maybe I'm to blame for that maybe I shouldn't order a classic burger if I want my taste buds titillated. Veggie frites? I was expecting something like crispy vegetables and they kind of ended up being a fairly small portion of oily limpdick veggies, at least they're salted nicely.  Total bill for lunch? $9 I might as well go to a nicer restaurant and pony up the extra $1 for a much more awesome burger. However when I'm in the Stonecrest area this will do in a pinch.",

Let's get right to the good stuff - the burger. Oh, boy! Juicy, chargrilled flavor. The regular, Smash (1/3 pound, I think) was perfect. I got mine with pepperjack cheese and the spicy chipotle mayo. Delish! And you have to try the Smash Fries. I've never had anything like them - the olive oil and rosemary give them a very upscale flavor. The husband also got a banana pudding milkshake - creamy and rich. No complaints there.  Atmosphere was not what I expected - for all the raving I'd heard I expected something similar to Big Daddy's. But no. It's a grab a menu at the door, order at the register, grab a number & a table and wait for someone to bring out your food sort of place. Decor is minimalist and trendy - very bright. Inviting, but not somewhere you're going to linger, which, I guess is the point. We will definitely be back!",

In doing so, it makes the sandwich look huge, something else I like!

There are plenty of salads and every burger can be made with chicken.  I had the baja grilled chicken sandwich and it was perfect!  Incredibly juicy and flavorful chicken, with avocados, jalapenos and spicy Baja sauce.  The sandwiches are huge, so while a little more expensive than some other seemingly similar restaurants, you definitely get your money's worth.    I almost always get sweet potato fries when available, but the owner taking my order suggested the smashfries.  I was hesitant to deviate--I mean, you can never go wrong with sweet potato fries!--but oh...my...gawd.  The smashfries alone are worth the visit.  They're tossed in rosemary, garlic and olive oil.  They're so incredible I'm pretty sure I bared my teeth and growled at the poor bus boy who offered to take my tray when I still had three fries left.....um, sorry about that, bud.  The place is popular and pretty busy at lunch, with limited seating.  But the service is friendly and fast and the food lives up to the hype!",

    "text": "I have been awaiting this Smashburger's opening for one year...yes, a year!  It is a teeny sized building but I guess for a Smashburger it's enough..or NOT. It is in a busy neighborhood, Cotswold,  and we have been in need of a good burger joint for a LONG time. I have been there 6 times now, anytime from 2pm til they close. I find there is always a 'line' of folks awaiting their \"\"to go\" orders, sometimes with friends and there IS little room inside the S/B to wait. The area to do so, is directly in front of the pick-up counter and in direct line to the drink machine. Last night I counted 11 people packed along the 'take out bar' (the bar really serves no purpose), 4-5 employees trying to get the orders sorted, and walk-thru traffic trying to get to the drink machine and it was 8PM (not the busiest time). There is NO drive-thru, but maybe there ought to be if for no other reason than to pick-up the take out orders?? The burgers are decent. They are as good as what I might make at my home IF I had more than myself to cook for. I like the toppings assortment, and the buns available just to mix it up a bit. Some toppings you pay extra for, some not. They are PRICEY even for today's prices in meats etc....$10.40 for a burger and small fries is just HIGH. I got a regular size Smashburger and an order of fries (I got the regular ones).  They skimped on the fries and they were not hot, but I didn't know that and will check next time before I leave. I live 1 mile away and like to knosh on the fries as a walk home. I am not fond of the 'smash sauce', and will not have that on my burger in the future. I am a weightloss surgery patient and they allowed me to order off the kids meal menu like most of the other Charlotte restaurants do, which is one of the MAIN reasons I go to any restaurant  these days. I can't really offer any information on any of the other food choices as MY main comings & goings here will be for the burgers. It was worth the wait, for me. I like knowing that my $6+ burger is cooked to order and has not been precooked or sitting under a heat lamp! They have me for a while.",

    "text": "The newest burger joint in South Charlotte located in Stonecrest.  It's a good, quick place to grab some food with your kids.  And I like the fact that they have healthier menu items other than burgers and a lot of options for customizing whatever sandwich you choose (burger, chicken, black bean, etc).   I opted for the black bean burger but they had some good looking salad options too.  The burgers are all huge...like they hang off the bun huge.  You definitely won't leave hungry.    My only complaint.  When they rang up our bill, it wasn't correct.  When I mentioned it to the kid at the register, he claimed it was right.  We double checked it again once we sat down and called the kid over to discuss it but he ignored us not once, but twice.  He then got the manager involved and the problem was rectified immediately.    My boys love burgers...it's convenient...and there are other items on the menu I look forward to trying (fried pickles, veggie frites, sweet potato fries, harvest salad).  We'll go back...",

    "text": "Thanks to my good friend (and Charlotte's best new photographer) Lindsay H., I was able to check out Smashburger's sneak peek tasting on Saturday.    I'll admit that the only reason I agreed to go to said event is because I rarely turn down free food.  The idea of yet ANOTHER gourmet burger joint in town coupled with having to head into suburban hell would not have tickled my trigger sans \"free food\" tagline.  If I want to pay $10 for a burger I can go to The Liberty, Big Daddy's, Pinky's, Burger Co, or Nix and not leave the 3 mile radius that I like to confine myself to on most days.  Fortunately, 485 was accident/idiot-free and I made it to Rea Rd. in record time.  It's a good thing, too, because Smashburger did not disappoint.    I'm not lying when I tell you that since Saturday I've eaten only one full meal.  I ate so much food (forced eating, I must add) that I've been living off of my dromedary hump for 2 days.  [insert Fergie music here]  And the food was right on.  Fresh ingredients and plenty to choose from.  I certainly don't want to describe in detail every menu item that I sampled, but I'll list them out below and tell you that most are worth trying.  It should be noted that the sweet potato fries are a bit rosemary-centered and the brunswick stew fries were not really my idea of a fun time.  But if you like stew-drenched fries you'll love these.  And the rundown of what I am currently burning off:  Baja Burger Baja Chicken Sandwich Carolina Burger Harvest Salad veggie frites sweet potato fries brunswick stew fries haystack onions chocolate milkshake Oreo milkshake",

I said, \"Sure that sounds great, I had just bookmarked this establishment out for a try. Surprise me with the burger.\"  So when Snoopy and Ebu -- our nicknames for our parents - show up with sustenance, you can bet I was ready to dig my teeth into some yum yums. They delivered the Spicy Baja - which is pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, red onion, spicy chipotle may and fresh jalpenos on a spicy chipotle bun.   It was pretty darn good! Snoopy remembered to order my ranch - don't really care for mayo (unless mum makes it) so I use a bit-o-ranch. I probably wouldn't order this one again, but I would order something else. The meat was of good quality, the produce fresh and not wilted, the guacamole was a bit runny for my standards (being from Cali--you know what REAL guac should taste like) and the bun was fabulous. The problem with take-out is that being the bun was soooo friggin fresh... it got a bit soggy as it soaked up all the burgers yumminess.   So on my next review of Smash, I will be sure to eat in and enjoy the ambiance! To soak it all in.... But for now, I'm sold.",

    "text": "There isn't a shortage of quality burger joints in Charlotte. Smashburger is a new addition in town. The burgers are decent, tasty, but, in all honesty, pretty blah. There's very little about Smashburger's food, or their restaurant, that separates them from other burger joints in town. Don't get me wrong, I love a greasy burger, but when you can squeeze enough grease to lube your car's engine, it's back to the drawing board for you.  Oh, and a word to future business entrepreneurs: if you're the owner or operator of a business or franchise that's getting ready to open to the public here very soon, and you see someone - namely, me - checking out your menu and taking a peek inside, take a few seconds to introduce yourselves and give a future customer the lowdown. This happened to me a few days before Smashburger opened; there were about 3 or 4 men who were clearly all part of this franchise milling around the front door, none of whom approached me or asked me if I had any questions. I'm not saying I needed to be flattered, but here's a golden opportunity to earn yourself some repeat business, and you let that opportunity pass. Didn't they learn you that in biz skool?",

    "text": "When you select the third star on the review entry page, the associated text reads \"A-OK.\"  This perfectly describes Smashburger, or at least how I view it.  We had been wanting to try it since it opened, but never quite managed to do so, since it seemed the line was out the door every time we went.  This past weekend, however, things seemed a lot more reasonable, so we took the plunge.  At Smashburger, you place your order at the counter, and an employee brings your food to the table when it's ready.  If you've eaten at Showmars or McAlister's, you know the routine.  There was only one slightly awkward moment: you pick up a menu at the door and are supposed to drop it off at the register after you order, but it's a pretty big sheet of paper, and there isn't really anywhere to leave it.   Once the food arrived, it was decent.  Not much more than that.  I got the classic, since I figured it was a fair first-time test.  The burger actually had some pink in the middle, which was a plus, but the patty could've stood a little more seasoning.  The bun was unremarkable.  As a side, I ordered rosemary-specked sweet potato fries.  Those were good: probably better than the burger, objectively speaking.  Honestly, if you want a burger from a chain, Five Guys is better, even though there isn't one in the immediate area.  If you are looking for a burger in Stonecrest, City Tavern is better (if more expensive).  Smashburger was decent; I may eat there again, but I won't be making any trips to Stonecrest just to visit it.",

    "text": "I too came for the sneak peek on Saturday before they opened (being an elite yelper has it's perks!)  I was a bit skeptical at first, we've had a lot of burger joints imported from the west coast that failed miserably.  But Smashburger is different. They have loads of options & you can customize your burger, chicken sandwich or salad.    The veggie frites are where it's at.  I love veggies & I love fried food so they're a win-win!  I love that you can choose your bun & the egg bun is seriously tasty, I just hope that they import the pretzel bun from their Chicago menu at some point.  You can put any number of toppings on your burgers from avocado to fried eggs.    The burgers were all surprisingly tasty & flavorful for a fast food joint.  I had the baja burger.  which, be warned,  is actually spicy, the bun even has chipotle peppers in it!  We also tried to Carolina burger, which, despite my hatred of slaw was mighty delicious.    I want to come back & try the chicken dishes.  We figured since it was a burger place we should try those first.  We split their blt chicken sandwich which was good but the combo of mayo & ranch dressing was pretty messy.  We also sampled the Harvest Salad & it was perfect.  spinach, lettuce, crumbly very mild blue cheese, balsamic dressing & sunflower seeds.  The salad itself was gigantic.  4 of us were eating it & we only made a dent!  Get the small or side salad version unless you plan on sharing!  The only thing our table unanimously agreed missed the mark were the brunswick fries. the sauce just wasn't authentic & they were really heavy.  The sweet potato fries were a bit heavy on the rosemary, but they were still good.",

Table turnaround time isn't bad. The last time I went when we opened the door we were the end of the line. In 13 minutes we were placing our order with a calm, cool, and collected cashier and by the time we filled our drink cups a table had opened up. On both trips here the food was delivered within 10 minutes. Overall not bad.

Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. It was just MEH and that made me sad.   We dined on a Saturday night at 7pm. What the heck were we thinking. The place was packed and there was NO place to sit. Our food came out but because we had no place to sit they had to put our food back in the window. I was not happy about that.   Once again my children were not very adventurous with their burgers. They played it safe and went for a Build Your Own ( Yawn).  My husband had the Carolina Burger which came on a Pretzel Bun. What? Is that a Southern thing? For me personally it's more like a Philly thing. My husband liked the burger but the bun was definitely a strange choice. Smashburger, if you want to rock my world with your Carolina Chili burger, throw the burger, slaw and chili on a biscuit!   I had the Chicken Club and let me tell you the chicken was so thin I could almost see right through it. Because the chicken was so thin the taste was lost and I felt like I was eating more of a BLT than a Chicken Club. I also had the Smash Fries which were fries with olive oil, rosemary and garlic. They were good but they were GREASY because the fries were a thin cut.  We surrendered our table quickly and bolted. If I go back it will be for maybe an early lunch or an early dinner so that way I don't feel so rushed.",

    "text": "Solid burger joint. The selection of burgers is fun and its nice to see whole wheat AND egg buns. I ordered a burger that came with apple wood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado. The beef was seasoned perfectly but a bit thin, I guess \"regular\" sized is one patty. The whole wheat bun was soft and sweet, you know sometimes whole wheat can be very cardboard like. I paired my burger with the sweet potato fries. Which were doused in sea salt, a bit off putting but once I shook some of the salt off they were decent. Possibly a bit over salted.   It's a solid place to grab a fast burger that doesn't make you feel as guilty as other places. The side selections are nice but nothing \"wowed\" me.",

    "text": "After a lackluster first try at a Smashburger in Overland Park, Kansas (yes, Kansas got a Smashburger before Charlotte did!) my husband and I decided to brave the Smash again, this time at the only location in NC, in Stonecrest.  (Though I'm told a new one near the Carolina Place Mall is expected soon.)   I \"liked\" Smashburger on Facebook prior to going, so we could get a free burger with the purchase of a \"Mex\" burger/chicken sandwich which is new.   When we got to the restaurant on a Thursday evening, it was pretty busy-- maybe 70%.  I was told by the very helpful cashier on Friday and Saturdays, the line is practically out the door. He also told me our food would be out within 5-7 minutes, which was right on the dot. Appreciated, young man.   The decor is clean and bright, minimalistic red and white...but more modern than the red and white of Five Guys.  The presentation of the food is nice in it's wire basket and clean ketchup and mustard caddies.   The Mex chicken sandwich was excellent.  Super thin chicken, cheese, avocado, red onions and a \"mexican\" style bun.  I bit into it and thought \"...oooh fresh!\" While I wouldn't call the chicken juicy (I'm a dark meat kinda gal, and to me anything white meat isn't juicy) but the toppings and sauces and everything really came together.   My black bean burger too was nice and flavorful.  This isn't like the Bad Daddy's deep fried black bean patty, but a griddled one, which yes, falls apart as you eat it, but I think it's a nice option.   Jimmy D...oh yes, I concur about these veggie frites.  They're definitely not crispy.  I was told they were flash fried veggies, so I assumed they'd be like the ones at PF Changs...those crispy string beans.  They were more like...uh, yeah, what Jimmy D said!  Limp and kind of like if boiled veggies got sprayed in oil. It was hard to keep the dipping ranch sauce on them they were so greasy and slippery.   The house fries are rosemary which I like-- and nice and shoestring.    A nice boy came by after our meal to take away our wire baskets that once held our food.    Bottom line, I thought the prices were pretty in-line with a casual fast burger joint, and I was pleased with the layout of the menu with toppings and options.  Just please, do something about those strange, strange veggie....limp things.",

    "text": "The guys and I arrived at the perfect time, after the early bird special but before the family scrum ensued.  It is a family establishment but also a grade school hangout.  The high-schoolers  working the counter offered great service and placed our orders efficiently. Smashburger has an order up front and they'll bring it to you system.        I ordered the big BBQ bacon cheeseburger and a side of sweet potato fries.  It was a solid burger and the fries were good, short and thin cut.    My only negative observation is that when you order a fountain drink, you get a house cup.  Taking a drink to go isn't much of an option.",

Saw the spicy Chipotle bun and thought great. It was stale. They must have microwaved it to soften it but as usual, that cause the edges to be hard. Not a real Chipotle taste either. Burger was average. The fries are good - olive oil and seasonings. Tried the Brunswick fries too since I love Brunswick stew. Meh. To barbecue saucy. Daughters burger was overcooked. Just not that great.",

    "text": "Not a bad quick-dining option if you're in the Stonecrest area.  The food is consistently good, but never really memorable.  I would define the quality of the grub as being stuck somewhere between a fast food burger chain and a Bad Daddy's or Cowfish, more along the lines of Five Guys (just not as good).  Service is soild - you order at the counter, take a number, and then your food is brought out to your table.  The management team has done a good job of balancing speed with the quality of service and the quality of the food.  We frequent the establishment mostly because we have small kids who eat anything deep fried, dripping in cheese, or made with ice cream.  They love it here.  The fountain, stairs, and live music in the outdoor space between Smashburger and the other restaurants/shops right there make for a perfect spot to let kids run around and burn off some of their chocolate shake calories without disturbing other patrons.",

For the $11 I paid it was definitely a disappointment.  The burger was mediocre and the fries were cold.  There are other burger places in Charlotte I would rather visit.  I figured I would try their Haagen Daas milkshake and, again, for the price, I was a little disappointed.  Not sure I'm going to return.",
