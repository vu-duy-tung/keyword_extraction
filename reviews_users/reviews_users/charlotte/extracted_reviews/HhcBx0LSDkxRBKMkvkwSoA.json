In addition to the comfortable atmosphere, the restaurant is very clean. Plus, the food is superb. As a person with Celiac's Disease, I surprisingly had a lot of appetizing options here. Their lunch deals are fairly cheap, and I love the complimentary small salad and sweet tea. I ordered the pad thai with seafood--which was $4 extra, but completely worth it. Sometimes restaurants cook the dish blandly, but Deejai made it savory with plenty of garnishes. Overall, the food is simultaneously delicious and affordable!",

The only reason my review has three stars is because the food was so good. I would recommend getting your food to go or another server.

On this particular night they had Tequila Sunrises on sale. It literally was the best Tequila Sunrise that I had ever drank! For the meal I had the Seafood Poke. This was soooo good. Fresh ingredients were certainly used. You could just taste the freshness with each bite. It had eel skin, shrimp, small softshell crab, tuna, salmon. It was sooo good. We also got the Honey Roll. Some of the best sushi ever! This place is great. I will be back to try other options. Good drink, Good food, and Great service...Why not!",

I had the salmon curry. Tasty but I wouldn't get it again. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the thin rice noodles and thick curry sauce didn't work for me. The kimchi poke bowl was tasty. I'd get that again.   Cons: The parking lot is weird to get in and out of. Save yourself the headache and park around the building. Service was fine but nothing to write home about.

Definitely coming back to this place to try their other foods!! This place is calling me back!",

The staff is incredible- very friendly and always willing to offer up some recommendations.   A few stand out dishes:  Thai spicy sausage- appetizer Kau Gai- noodle stir fry (we got ours with chicken and shrimp... life changing!) Lemongrass pork- vermicelli noodle dish Green curry- served with rice Nam Prik- noodle soup with a rich coconut broth   Don't forget to check in on yelp! Your first check in gets you an edamame app. They also have some incredible sauces like a spicy cilantro fish sauce and spicy chili garlic that you have to ask for. Particularly yummy on the Kau Gai!  Can't wait to return to explore the menu more :)",

You want find shrimp sauce here however you will find this delicious cilantro lime hot sauce that seems vinegar based and is off the chain. Like put it in my baby bottle divine. Good stuff. I would say nothing on the menu would disappoint. Sushi, curry, pad Thai, drunken noodles, pork belly tacos... This place will literally blow your millennial head off and it will land on the hipsters plate next to you. Enjoy.",

The interior is cool and has a trendy vibe, and there is a bar as well as a sushi bar area as well.   I had the drunken noodles, which is my usual order if they don't have pad see ew. Although the flavors were there and they didn't shy away from spice which is something I appreciate, there were just too few noodles in my dish. I found myself hunting and digging within my vegetables to find the noodles to eat. I think they could have lessened the amount of bell peppers and broccoli a significant amount to find a better balance. I'd have to come here again to see if this was a fluke or if they consistently don't add enough noodles. This is why I'm giving it 4 stars, because if it is a fluke and they usually give more, it would be an excellent dish.   My friend had one of their curries which she did enjoy, although it wasn't the best she's ever had. She also ordered an avocado bubble tea and while it was good, it was definitely coconut flavored instead of the avocado she ordered. They also put whipped cream on top which was not completely necessary, but some might like it.",

Like many Thai places, this one has a scale ranging from 1-5 in which you can select your level of spice you want on your food. I decided on a 3 which proved to be a bit too mild for me, but i tend to really like spicy food.   I chose the Chicken Pad Thai, (a classic American choice I know), but I wanted to play it safe with a new restaurant choice. I cannot comment much on the inside of the restaurant other than it was well lit and appeared to have modern seating. There was also outdoor seating available.   I was hanging out at Crown Station next door and the hostess said she would be more than happy to bring my food over. It was a healthy portion and not lacking in flavor by any means. If you like Thai, or if you're looking to broaden your taste buds check out Deejai!",

The flavor was a bit one dimensional. I think I'll stick to Futo for the Ramen.   The honey honey sushi was regular to me. Like something I've had at other places. I think I'll stick to Fujo for my Godzilla roll. That's my barometer for sushi.   So this is where things got a bit muddled....  My homie gets the lemongrass chicken dish and he wasn't feeling it because he said the ground up chicken tasted like it was chicken sausage, and the flavor was okay. So he ordered the pork chop with some rice and he ate a piece off the end. When he cut into it it was pink. He asked me if it was undercooked and I was like yea, it's too pink. So he sends that back. You don't want to play with undercooked Pork. The manager or owner maybe came through apologizing profusely and mentioned this is the second time this has happened. Uh oh!   They comped his meal and asked if he wanted anything else. He got the chicken wings. He said they were good. I saw a lady by us tearing her wings up! Like no meat left.  So because everyone was so caught up in how they messed up on my homies food, no one asked me how my food was.... if I needed anything... if I cared for any dessert.   I'm only speaking on my experience (clearly) and they did great with rectifying the situation with my homie, but that left me out of the picture. I wasn't looking for some free food or a constant stream of check ins. Maybe just \"how was your food ma'am?\"  I don't think i would have cared about that if my food was great, but because it was aight, my experience isn't soured, it's just eh.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I found this place after seeing the Groupon deal. After reading some of the reviews I had some concerns about service but thankfully there were no issues. We were greeted as soon as we entered and seated promptly. The server explained the drink specials for the day as well as answered any menu questions.  The not-so-good news: they were out of spring rolls! Needless to say I was disappointed as they are a staple to just about every Asian restaurant. But understanding that things happen, decided to go with the pork belly tacos and Thai chicken wings as appetizers. The tacos were the stand out of the two. The pork belly was just crispy enough like I prefer. The wings were good but average.  On to the sushi course. We ordered both the panther and honey honey roll. It was very fresh and tasty. I would have to say that I preferred the panther roll even though I'm not usually a hug fan of soft shell crab but the flavors were delicious! The honey honey roll was good too but more suited to someone looking for a more basic roll.  By the time the entrees came out we were stuffed and boxed them up to go. I was even more pleased when I went to dig into my box later that night. The spicy basil chicken and the drunken noodles with shrimp were as spicy as requested and flavorful. They work on the standard 5-star spicy rating system. We requested a 4 on both dishes and they delivered. The drunken noodles had ample shrimp and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The spicy basil was bursting with flavor while the jasmine rice complemented it well. Groupon may have lured me in but the food and service is what will bring me back!  Note: Parking is super tight so just be prepared.",

Prior to Deejai NoDa, we would venture to various locations across the city for tasty thai - I don't think it's particularly hard to find in Charlotte.  But, what I love about Deejai NoDa is the addition of poke bowls and great service.  You can also order online and have it delivered next door to Crown Station or Divine Barrell - win/win!",

    "text": "Beyond disappointed at my dinner experience last night at DeeJai in Noda. 2 friends and I went in for dinner last night, ordered apps, 3 entrees and a 24oz bottle of sake. They were out of the big bottles so they brought us 2 small bottles instead. We decided to just go with one small bottle and not the 2. We ate, drank, and dinner was great as usual...   When we got the check, we saw that we were charged the price for the big bottle, which was $35.00 when it should have been $14 for the small bottle. We brought this to the attention of our server, she quickly went back to change the check for us. This is when everything literally went to hell. The \"manager\" comes up to us trying to explain (VERY RUDELY) that we didn't get the 10 oz bottle of sake for $14 but we got half of a 24oz bottle for $35, so the check should be $17.50. We were confused because they don't serve 12oz bottles of sake JUST 10oz and 24oz. After trying to figure this whole situation out, going back and forth with this manager, I asked her to please ring in the correct bottle and then we will pay the check (at this time we were still being charged for half the bottle of $17.50). She refuses, and says she cannot delete things on her POS system.... ANYONE who has EVER worked in service industry knows that is a bold face lie... The manager on duty REFUSED to fix our check. Not only did she refuse to fix our check, she was the rudest, most unprofessional \"manager\" I have ever encountered. Our poor server was appalled throughout this entire situation. I wouldn't be surprised if she quit after seeing her \"manager\" act in such a manner.  After being a loyal DeeJai customer since opening, my party and I will not be returning here. The way that the LADY MANAGER WITH THE SHORT HAIR (I never got her name) handled everything, and the way that she spoke to us was beyond inappropriate and just down right rude. Worst customer service I have EVER experienced...",

The Thai sausage was a little bit charred which was just the way we like it.  Spring rolls came out nice and hot.  My main dish was the Ramen Slow-Cooked Short Ribs and it was perfect for a cold night!  The broth was a little thicker than the usual broth which I really liked, and the noodles themselves were great!  The ribs were nice and tender and pretty lean too.  My boyfriend had the Pad See Ew which didn't disappoint and is always a classic favorite.  And last but not least, the crepe dessert was delicious!  They ran out of bananas and used mangos instead and I'm so glad they did!  The crepe itself was crispy and flaky, the perfect texture and flavor.  We'll definitely be back again!",

I am obsessed with noodles/sushi/Thai so I was very much looking forward to making this my go-to spot. I ordered online, got a confirmation on the screen, an email that my account was created, and a charge on my credit card. When I got to the restaurant, they couldn't find an order from me. I wasn't the only one. I waited over 30 mins to speak to the manager because the hostess (who was very sweet) wasn't sure what to do.  I continuously clicked the link to take me to my account to show my orders but it only brought me to the menu.   The manager came - she was extremely rude and belittling, that despite all of my evidence there was no way it was an error on their end or in their system and there was nothing she could (or would) do.   I am not confrontational, one to argue, or be rude. I am patient and am always understanding because things happen. But instead I left empty handed and in tears because of how this manager treated me.",

When we arrived at 5:15pm, there was hardly anyone there so we were seated immediately. We ordered the papaya noodle salad appetizer from one waitress and then our entrees from another. The appetizer arrived in about 10 minutes after we ordered. As we were eating, we discovered that there was a piece of hair on the bottom of an egg. Then, we waited for an hour for the entrees to be served. I asked the second waitress if it usually takes this long for the food to be cooked. She told me that unfortunately, it does because they go in the order our tickets are placed in the line. This didn't make sense to us because we had previously come to the restaurant two weeks ago on a very busy Friday night. Our food was served in half the time. I am very torn to come back or not because of the second experience.",

    "text": "Excellent little Thai place in Noda. Very sleek and new inside, although it gets tight when busy with the narrow floor plan. Service is always ver friendly but can be spotty  as far as checking back, or servers handing you off - especially on busy nights. The drink menu is fun and everything we've tried we've enjoyed. The food is excellent. Great sushi, really yummy noodle dishes - my favorite is the Pad See Ew (which isn't listed on the menu online but I always get in the restaurant), and incredible Thai wings!",

I started by sitting outside, but the sun kept pounding us so we came inside. Such nice decor.  I ordered a Strawberry Blossom drink. To be honest, I forgot what was in it, but obvioiusly strawberry juice, and some kind of sake. Oh!! There was rum in there. AH-MAZING. For my food, I ordered the Ba Mi Ped w/ Broth. They have a version of this that is dry, but I couldn't imagine the dish dry. The broth set it over the top. I'll definitely order again.  If there is one con.. I would say it's the service. Waitress was very attentive but it took a while to try to track someone down for me to get to-go containers and some other things. That is not going to stop me from going again because the food was fantastic. Forget that I even mentioned that con.  Just bring yourself here with a nice group of friends. The ambiance is fabulous, the drinks were fabulous, the food was fabulous, and you will be too once you leave. Two thumbs up.",

And of course we also ordered the chicken pad thai which was stellar. The ambiance of this restaurant is so inviting and cozy.

They apparently sell it by the bottle but were out of the bottles (it was a Monday so I get it). Will definitely be back when I need to get my Thai fix.",

At first it was hard to find a restaurant since it's in such an industrial part of no die and parking in the front of the restaurant is definitely tight. Easier parking is found in the lot behind the restaurant. There are some tables for outdoor seating, but we decided to sit inside because it was quite warm. The restaurants interior has an easy urban elegance to it and we were seated at a table along the wall. Although the restaurant wasn't very busy on a Saturday at 4:30, I did have to signal the waitress a couple times and we needed something. Everyone that works there seemed very nice.  We started out with some Edamame which was free since I posted a check in for the restaurant. Then we had some fried wonton dumpling Which were hot and delicious, served with a sweet and spicy chili oil sauce. For entrees I had the roast duck with noodles and I had it with broth which was delicious. My vegetarian daughter had the pad Thai with tofu and said it was great. My youngest daughter had the Short rib Ramen and my husband had the lemongrass pork which both were yummy as well! We took leftovers with us but had to have dessert of course. We shared the sweet rice pudding with mango and the moji green tea ice cream which capped off a delightful dinner! We will definitely be back for another memorable meal in the near future",

I ordered the salmon curry and it was phenomenal. The only issue that we came across was that it took the a VERY long time to get our food out. Even just the edamame. Just for the appetizer alone it took around 20-25 min. It was a long time after that when we received our entrees.  So if you are in a rush definitely don't go. Other than that the atmosphere is welcoming and the food is absolutely delicious.",

I ordered the vegetable lover rice bowl and was amazed but how much flavor was packed into this dish! The entree included broccoli, green beans, cabbage, mushroom, carrots and fried tofu. The portion was a pretty good size but next time I'll be asking for lite tofu, I prefer a lot of vegetables! I ordered a 3 on the spicy level and I thought it was the perfect level. I'm the type of person who enjoys really spicy food and I personally thought the 3 was a good level. If you don't like spicy food then I recommend getting a 1 or 2.",

What a freaking gem for a noodle fanatic like me and so close to home. This is definitely my new favorite spot. Our waitress was very personable, friendly, attentive and actually seemed to love what she does. The initial walk-in I started to question the level of service bc the guy who I later found out was the bar back took us to the table without saying one word. Not a hello, hru, are you a zombie or do you prefer brains with your noodles. I would recommend everyone being personable with customers you never know if their a Yelper, Health inspector, yadda yadda yadda.   Thank you to our wonderful waitress for setting a high standard of service. As for the food, it was literally finger licking, lip sucking good! Having moved from NYC, I tasted some authentic Asian and Asian Fusion noodles dishes and I must say this met my expectations. My hat off to the kitchen/chef.  If you're into noodles, check out this gem! You won't be disappointed!  Ramen Short Rib Pad See Wey Mimosa Proseco",

He did give us a full refund with a fresh order of the same thing we ordered (Veggie lovers). He was very good and understanding, however, the presentation of the food from the first time was completely unacceptable and being that we were out of towners the first impression is everything. I will change my star rating from a 1 star to s 3 star with the manager fixing the issue, but i assure you we will not be returning.",

Okay.. maybe the parking isn't the greatest but I live in the area so that's not a problem for me!   First off! Make sure you check in on yelp! There might be a little something in it for you ;)   I've been frequenting this spot recently because it's just so easy to just go and get a different variety. They have sushi, poke, noodles, and tons of great appetizers. The options are endless!!   The many times we've been in we have been served by Jackie (and seated by her twin sister!) But she has been absolutely the best. But everyone else that has helped us in the restaurant has been absolutely amazing.   They have to go orders and you can get it delivered. Explore the menu and find out what this place is all about!!",

The appetizers: (edamame & spring rolls) and sushi (honey) were good. The spring rolls had a great peanut dipping sauce.  The drunken noodles, I ordered a special way, omitting some items and the waitress literally came back three times to ask me what the order was again. After writing it down the first time.  Well, third times a charm, because it came out tasty!  I got 4 spicy, but could've done 5.   Mango sticky rice was delicious.  Food was very good. Environment was nice...beautiful inside and a patio outside.  Service, not what I would've expected.  Maybe a bad day.",

The place was relatively empty when we arrived and we were seated right away. The hostess that took us to our seat, ended up being our waitress but she never introduced herself and seemed to be a bit confused about the menu and the overall service.   However, the service aside the food was pretty good. I tried the Honey Honey roll and the Drunken Noodles with shrimp. The sushi roll was just okay. It didn't wow me, but I think a few other places have spoiled me. However, it was very pretty when it arrived to the table.  The drunken noodles were very good. I ordered them with some modifications and a spice level #4 and would definitely order it again! They use nice size shrimp and all the flavors worked together so nicely. Plus, it arrived hot to the table pipping hot and I loved the flower! If you're debating what to try first - I'd recommend starting with this dish!   Overall, good presentation and good flavors! Once they work the service out this place has real potential.",

I ordered a cocktail and while it was a bit too sweet for me, it was as described.  For my entree I chose the Ramen noodle short rib dish.  It was fantastic and the short rib portion was cooked to perfection.  Warms my bones.

I had the spicy tuna and honey honey roll. Both were very tasty, although I feel like the Siracha sauce was a little strong on the spicy tuna. Don't get me wrong, I love it spicy, but usually there's a good blend of spice, not just a lot of siracha. The honey honey was delicious, but they were out of avacado, so I got all salmon on top...which I certainly did not mind!   I love that they have a large patio area and a garage door that opens in the nice weather, really giving it a great vibe. The servers were friendly and punctual and very knowledgeable about the sushi selections! If you're in Noda, definitely stop by this place!!",

So here's another one for them. The ginger lemonade was great, coming from someone who isn't the biggest fan on ginger drinks. I even had a few, it was that good with a little alcohol kick to it. Started off with the steamed dumplings, soft with a nice bite to them. I'll get the fried ones next time to compare.  The fried rice was delicious, exactly what I've come to expect from a Thai restaurant. I ordered both the Tsunami and Lobster Rolls. I prefer the Tsunami by a slight margin, but you can't go wrong with either. My date had soup, I can't recall the name, but it had Seafood and a curry base- not like that could narrow it down, right?

I ordered the mango drink and that was really good and sweet. As I sat there eating and people watching, it made me feel like I was somewhere else, but not in Charlotte. The vibe was so cool.

It took 20 minutes to get The Godfather roll & almost 35 minutes to get the Lotus Flower roll it had to be baked but we didn't know that up front (maybe our own fault) and they were not busy at all.

They seem to have a ton of regulars... a rather good sign for such a new restaurant!   The wings are amazing, to start. I've had a handful of their lunch dishes and have loved every one of them... and they're such a great deal. Basil chicken and drunken noodles are both delicious. The sushi items I've tried seem to be fresh and filling as well. A definite must try if you're around the NoDa area!",

We've all been there though right!?  I am so glad I came. It has a sexy \"I feel like I'm not even in Charlotte\" vibe but that's Noda for you. It's really small and can feel kinda tight but they make a really great use of the space.  I was really surprised at how inexpensive everything was. We had $40 for our Groupon and found it difficult to spend all of it without getting an appetizer, dessert or both. We went with both! .  Though it was tough to choose an appetizer (because I get pork belly whenever I see it on the menu and the pork belly tacos looks delicious) we went with the Thai wings but we were certainly not disappointed. They were so amazing! Their ranch was also very good.  For my meal I chose the pork and rice and I knew it was going to be delicious just from the presentation. I was right! So good! It came with two sauces and it was super hard to know which one to dip next. It also came with a soup with a cilantro based broth that was also very good. It was a nice surprise because I don't remember seeing it on the menu.  My wife. One of the Poke bowls. I can't remember which one but it's the only one that has jalapenos and it's also the most expensive thing on the menu. Also very delicious.  On the table you'll find your standard spicy garlic sauce but they had another green signs that I've never had at another and I Restaurant. You had to take him to go. It was so good!  Suffice it to say we're buying another Groupon and will be here again soon!",

They weren't too familiar with their own draft list, which was a bit of a bummer. The sake cocktails are ok. I wouldn't recommend ordering one.   We had edamame and wings as an appetizer. The wings were very good. Delicious sauce.   I ordered the Kao Soi. They also serve this at Rai Lay, their sister restaurant. Everyone at the table wished they had ordered my dish. It's their signature, and it's fantastic! We've had this dish in Northern Thailand where it originated and there's is just as good.   My friends ordered their pork ramen. They said it was good, but said it didn't have the depth of flavor of the kao soi.   I have been one other time and loved the salmon curry. It was delicious, and I'd never had anything like it.   Last but not least, order the mango sticky rice. Just do it. It's so friggin good.",

They always have drink specials as well as local beers on tap. Plus, they are right next to Divine Barrel if you are looking for food after a few beers.   The food is what I would guess is pretty authentic. The most recent time we visited, I ordered the salmon curry soup. This is a creamy soup... very rich. It basically is a coconut milk and curry broth with noodles, two filets of salmon, and lots of veggies. I appreciate all the veggies and the pescatarian option. I also like that you can customize your spice level, you just have to ask. Most things you order are also large enough to have leftovers, which is awesome.  However, I will say their sushi seems a little pricey. Maybe their roles are bigger than other sushi places in Charlotte, but I've honestly never ordered one because I hate to spend $20 on a meal of 2 rolls that I know I'll eat all of versus $18-20 on something I will get leftovers from.  The vibe of the place is what would call a take on a sportsbar? They have a good number of tvs and always have some game or another on. It's not absurdly loud, but it can get a bit noisy in there if the restaurant is full. The only complaint I have is that their front door doesn't have a waiting area or entrance area, so there's not much room to stand and when bigger groups come, the front door gets left open, and it was very cold and drafty on our last visit.  They also do takeout!",

We went for dinner and thought the portions were pretty decent. Salmon was about $16 and they didn't charge me extra for the rice sub.  Our hostess was not as attentive and seemed to chat more with the usual customers (overhead her welcome them back). We had to keep flagging her down which I did not like.

We ordered pad see you, larb chicken, spicy tuna poke bowl, and spicy basil fried rice. The poke bowl was a bit too vinegary for me to enjoy it. The fried rice was amazing but literally sat in a puddle of dark yellow oil, which made it kind of unappetizing upon seeing.  The pad see you and larb chicken were good as well.  The service was average and it is slightly pricey. The restaurant is worth visiting and trying for sure! I don't think it's for me, but I definitely don't regret going.",

Though it is now considered part of 'greater' NoDa, besides this place, there's just a bar/coffee place, 2 breweries, a paint store, and loads of apartments.  As NoDa expands and the light rail brings people and demand, things will rapidly change.  The food here is reliably good and tasty.  I've indulged mostly in an old standard - pad Thai - and it's really, REALLY good. I've also tried some of the appetizer dumplings and shared in the poke bowl.    Aside from eating in-house once, I've mostly taken advantage of their quick and efficient delivery next door at Divine Barrel Brewery.  This has become a go-to \"activity\" for my wife and I.

I know good authentic Thai food and am usually disappointed in the dumbed down \"farang\" (foreigner) versions dished out most.  IWas very excited to see Deejai open another location. The Noda/Plaza Midwood areas have sorely needed a Thai restaurant.  Deejai Noda does a really nice job.  They haven't had their grand opening so the menu was still limited. My girlfriend and I have sampled Deejai 2 times in the last week, dine in and cary out.  Dine in appetizer was the fried won tons, tasty but slightly over done..but not a miss, the green papaya salad was just ok...too many noodles, not enough green papaya and very mild heat....needs work IMO.  We shared the Nam Prik as a main dish and it was very good. We ordered the springs rols and Nam Prik again for take out and it was even better.   Check it out",

I've been visiting Deejai Thai for years and when they opened this location I had to try it as well. They've actually become my favorite!  (Although it seems they are no longer owned by the same person).   I generally get the edamame or Thai chicken wings as my starter. My CURRENT favorite entree would be the drunken noodles with shrimp! It's always full of flavor. The Pad Thai is also excellent. You can't go wrong with either of these dishes. By far my favorite Thai Family (Deejai Noda, Deejai Thai and Rai Lay)",

    "text": "We finally made it to DeeJai, I've had the original location bookmarked for a long time and never made it there. Father's Day weekend while in Noda walking around with my family my husband stated that he was getting hungry so we began to try to decide where to eat having many choices in the area. I thought back to a couple days prior at a Yelp Elite event at Jeni Splendid right around the corner where Michelle P. (Yelp buddy) mentioned heading to the new DeeJai in NoDa since it was so close by. I made mention to my husband and he was totally game.  We decided to WALK which was not the BEST idea when it's hot out or when you have a stroller as the sidewalks end and start up a block later a couple times if walking from NoDa coming from Haberdish direction. However we made it, HOT but we made it and was seated immediately and provided excellent customer service. They noticed that we may be parch and offered us cold water which was appreciated .  We started with the veggie spring roll app as well as the mussel app. My children devoured the spring rolls before my hubby and I got a chance to taste them so we had to order more. They were really good and flavorful, I had to squeeze them in a napkin first because there was a lot of grease. The mussels were a must must must. You mussss get the mussels and order a side of rice with them #ThankMeLater  The mussel broth was extremely flavorful that we refuse to let it go away from the table post mussels so we ordered rice and was able to make a rice dish with the veggies and green curry sauce from the mussels. Yum yum yum  My husband tried the curry salmon as a entree and he enjoyed it, we ordered based on yelp suggestions and I wouldn't say it wasn't a good suggestion.  The curry on the salmon was good yet different from the mussels (green vs yellow) and after having the green curry nothing could compare. My only tidbit about this place other than the too much grease on the spring rolls (should let them drain a little before serving them) is the fact that they don't have their liquide license yet and I was in the mood for a cocktail. Ooh I mush mention we were also not informed about the many mocktails when we inquired and ended up sky water and Thai Tea. We noticed the sign on the way out which sucked.",

No condiments unless requested....20$ for a bowl  $16 for fried rice...not exactly expensive, but quality IS suffering.",

It did come with a sauce, but I didn't care for the flavor of the sauce either. We also had some edamame which was free with the Yelp check in, and it was good. The fried noodles that came with the entree were also very tasty with the sweet and sour sauce.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to check out Deejai for awhile now, and am so glad I finally did!   Surprisingly, the place is fairly big for a Noodles bar (think I was expecting a Japanese-sized Ramen bar?). Well, maybe not big...but long? Also, I liked the long, continuous booth-style seating, and its casual, yet chic decor. They had some extra-sweet touches as well, like gorgeous flowers placed on every table and elegantly-folded napkins!  Anyway, decided to try their Salmon Curry...and it was Amazing!! The spiciness was perfect, the salmon was delicious, and I loved the variety of unique veggies.  Unlike some ethnic foods, where you have to order veggies on the side/a la carte, I love how most Thai dishes come with an abundance of veggies, along with the meats. I was also impressed with the complimentary wonton strips. For drinks, I tried their Thai Iced Tea...which came in a long, elegant glass. Unfortunately, I didn't love the drink, but it was Okay. To cap it all off, I had their Thai Crepe...and this was to die for!!! I absolutely love crepes, ice cream and mangos...and this had all three!  Service was quick, attentive and friendly...even informative. I was even given a card, which is basically their rewards program, offering $10 off on 6th visit (?).  The only real issue I had was the heat...but then, it was my decision to sit right by the garage-window, with the sun blasting through. Not sure if the rest of the restaurant was cooler and air conditioned, but my seating area was quite warm.    Overall, this might be one of the best (if not THE??) Thai restaurants I've been to in Charlotte...and I've been to alot! Can't wait to try a few more things on their menu...if I can resist the Salmon Curry again, that is!",

TLC, Destiny's Child, the playlist was on point this a Wednesday evening.  Speaking of Wednesday, it was half price bottles of wine night. Let's talk about self-control, Andrea and I stuck to water and behaved on a school night. Don't worry, we're not total grown ups, there was a good 5 minute long debate beforehand.  Let's get down to business, I love their Tom Yum soup here. I always get it with shrimp. Usually I'll get a hot pot for myself (for the 'gram of course), but also so I can have leftovers to take home. For this latest trip, we went with the Hamachi Yellowtail with jalapeno and wasabi yuzu sauce (appetizer on the specials menu), Drunken Noodles with chicken, and each got our own individual bowls of Tom Yum (only because we would both be gone the next day and didn't want to waste leftovers). It was all delicious. The Drunken Noodles was a good-sized portion. We still ended up both taking home leftovers of that. No complaints here.  Specials: (listed as of 2/27/2019) Tuesday: buy 1, get 1 half off sushi roll (less or equal value) Wednesday: half price bottles of wine Thursday: $4 draft beers Friday: $1 off local canned beers  The parking lot in front of the restaurant is small and super awkward. But don't worry, there's other parking options including a lot diagonally across the street (on the opposite side of Bold Missy).",

    "text": "I came in here to celebrate my birthday with an original party of 9. Since it was a larger group, I made reservations the day before. However, when I walked in to the restaurant and said I had a reservation they completely disregarded that and only stated that they had the table in the front with 8 seats and 1 person would have to sit at the end. These tables were super high with uncomfortable seats- I would recommend asking for seats near the back. When I walked back to the bathroom it looked really cozy. I wished I had asked for that area. Also there are only 2 bathrooms- 1 for men and 1 for women. They should consider making them unisex because they are both the exact same- the men's doesn't have a urinal in it!   Service was pretty good, it took a while for the food to come but we didn't mind since we had checked in for our free edamame and that was holding us over. Each person who checks in gets a free bowl! Our server was also really nice when another person joined our party- now a party of 10. He was hard to get ahold of sometimes even though the restaurant space was pretty small.   Now, for the best part: the food! It was sooo delicious! I got the drunken noodles with tofu and that tofu was perfectly cooked. I've had some drunken noodles before that were too dry or too saucy and not flavorful. The drunken noodles at Deejai are amazing. The perfect amount of sauce and flavor. I was really sad when I forgot my leftovers at the restaurant. I also got the lycheetini which was perfect. Loved that they put a lychee in there. The other members of the party liked their food too, however a few people who got soups said that the soup was only warm and not hot enough for them. I didn't get to try them myself. Another friend loved the sushi!  I would definitely come back here, probably with a smaller group because the restaurant space is smaller and it's hard to navigate with a larger group though the server did a fairly good job at it. They didn't do anything extra for my birthday which might bum some people but the amazing noodles certainly made it up for me.",

I think between all the construction around Craighead and just the cramped feeling of NoDa lately in general, I have overlooked this gem of a restaurant time and time again, but I'm glad I finally made it.  Yet another cold night where no one in the house felt like cooking, so tonight seemed like a good opportunity to cross this place off the \"must try\" list. Me and the wife arrived around 7:30 to a relatively busy restaurant but were immediately seated. First things first, check-in on Yelp! Free Edamame check-in offer and it's not a 'freebie' size, it's the same as the $5 starter on the menu!  I'm a simple guy with simple tastes, so I see Pad Thai on the menu at a Thai restaurant, and I'm gettin' it! Krissy got the Ramen Short Rib and we split the Edamame while we waited on the entrees. In perfect timing fashion, our bowls came out as soon as the last soy bean was gone!  The Pad Thai was visually stunning. Vibrant green cilantro, fresh purple cabbage, orange tamarind sauce, and thin noodles with peanuts and scallions all came together for a wonderful flavor profile. The sauce was the dominant taste of the dish with a sweet and sour vibe. It might have been a little too sweet for my taste but everything worked well all the same. Chicken was moist and complimented the dish very well. I was especially happy with the veggies. They chop the scallions coarsely but cook them tender, giving them a nice crunch while still rounding out the harsh onion notes to a more mellow level.  I had a few bites of my wife's ramen bowl and while she thought the broth could have been spicier, I appreciated the delicate complexity of the dashi style profile. An earthy base with bright, salty notes. To each their own, but I would have been happy with either her dish or mine, no regrets!  Read the other reviews on the parking situation, it's a no-win situation but there's not many other options. Maybe take a light jog from the sugar creek parking deck?  I'll keep Deejai NoDa on my radar for whenever I'm in the mood for some quality Thai Cuisine. With a whole menu of unique dishes, there's a whole lot more to explore here.",

I ordered green curry with shrimp and the wings. I love the wings (saved those for lunch for the next day). The shrimp and green curry was excellent! It had lots of vegetables and wonderful shrimp. I even tried the pain killer drink...I wasn't a fan of that.  My only concern is when it was time to pay the tab, our server could not find one of our table guests, and instead of looking for her, she made it appear that the person left without paying, even though their boxed food and wallet was on the table still. The manager did not handle that situation professionally. Other than that, I will come here again.",

    "text": "Deejai is a place that my girlfriend and I have become fond of the last few months. When we discovered it, we ended up getting hangover Thai from here two weekends in a row.   I haven't actually been in the restaurant itself, we've gotten delivery and picked up food, so I can't speak on the setting inside or outside.  What I can speak on is the awesome quality of the food. I've had some of the sushi, a couple different noodle bowls, and the fried rice. It's ALL good.  Being fairly new to the sushi game, I'm always a little hesitant to order sushi from somewhere and eat it anywhere but the restaurant. The dynamite roll I got from Deejai was GREAT after I brought it home and there was a ton in the box, too.  The fried rice is stupid good. I'd eat it hot. I'd eat it cold. I'd eat it in between.There's a bunch of different flavors in there and they do it so well.  The best dish I've had is the salmon curry! The amount of flavor they get out of that curry is insane. I'm not a huge salmon fan either, but this is just delicious. You can ask them to spice it up pretty generously but be careful, they give you what you ask for.  Overall I'd say this is a great place to pick up some Thai or get some delivered. I look forward to trying more things on the menu!",

Here's what we ordered:  Thai Chicken Wings-super tasty, seasoned well and covered in a sweet/spicy sauce, however, the sauce wasn't spicy. Anyone could enjoy them. I always order my wings extra wet, I suggest you to the same. My 1st batch of wings wasn't hot, so I sent it back and they brought the remakes to me straight from the fryer.  Energy roll & Tsunami roll- yummyyyyy, fresh, delish. The rolls are a good size as well. My love and I each had a sushi roll and then split an entree and were stuffed.   Ba Mi Ped Dry- we asked for the broth on the side. The broth was clear and suuuuuuuuper light in flavor, but was still nice. The noodles were like ramen, didn't have a ton of flavor and the duck didn't necessarily taste BBQ'd. There weren't any herbs or sauces served with the dry noodle dish and sauce is exactly what was needed. This dish was just ok.  I can see us going here once a month due to the yummymess factor and this locations proximity to us.",

    "text": "A great addition to the NoDa community and the Deejai brand. I love the original Deejai in Elizabeth, but am beginning to think I like the NoDa location more! Why? They have POKE BOWLS! Remember the sudden burst of poke places in Charlotte? Well you wouldn't believe it, but Deejai comes pretty close to my favorite. I love coming here because I can have my cake and eat it too.. meaning have my poke bowl AND have their delicious Thai dishes too.  I've tried all of the poke bowls and honestly, you really can't go wrong. I like the Three Amigos one the most. It comes with guac? Strange, I know.. but I love it. It goes really well with the fish! That's the other thing.. it comes with the most variety of fish and the flavors just magically simulate. Okay, I really didn't think I had this much to say about poke bowls but obviously, I digress..  Deejai NoDa puts an interesting spin compared to their other location. They feature a lot more out of the ordinary, yet authentic Thai dishes that I don't usually get at other Thai restaurants. My favorites are:  Stir Fry Noodles: 1. Drunken Noodles 2. Pad Thai 3. Pad See Ew   Soups: 1. Tom Yum (great for sharing!) 2. Salmon Curry 3. Kao Soy (a traditional yellow curry)  You have to get the Thai tea. I don't know what they do to it, but it's magical! I also really love the Mango Sticky Rice (it comes with a scoop of ice cream)! I think I've posted pics of all of these items. Good luck!",

I had the honey honey roll. and the tofu pad Thai. It was really good. The service was great but the space was tight and impersonal. The food, from what I could tell was really good. The kitchen is open so you see what is going on. I'm sorry. I don't know what this place is missing but it's something. The food was good but it seemed like it was a little bit impersonal. They don't have full booths and no matter where you sit you are facing or almost in the walkway. It seemed like it wasn't small but it was poorly spaced out. That is really what my main beef was with the place. It shouldn't stop anybody from going here. The food is good. That's what matters. The dimmed lights also make it feel cramped. I have dragged on a little but it isn't a date night place. It is the type of place you go to when you have a list of places you want to go to in one night. Overall. Great place but doesn't feel like a sit down meal",

What if I would to be allergic to Basil? Just a side note. I understand that is an hour before closing but if there was others was still there when we left is a shitty customer service.",

It was much less sweet than I was expecting, but to be honest, I actually liked the difference!  Maybe next time I'll test out something else to see what will be my \"go to\" item here...I just wish they had more sushi options that *don't* contain raw fish :\\",

    "text": "People absolutely love this place and I heard the greatest things ever about it prior to going. The food is very authentic and if you're into the real deal Asian experience, this place has got ya covered. If I'm being honest though, my husband and I didn't really care for our meals. I got the boat noodles because I was afraid of most of the other dishes and he got the ramen because he said it was the only 'lo mien' noodle he could find on the menu. We were told to get the dumplings as an app, but they were out of them when we got there so we skipped on getting anything in hopes that the meal would blow us away. We tried each other's dishes and my opinion of the ramen is that it has a strong egg flavor. Granted, there are eggs in the soup and the noodles have egg in them I'm sure, but the flavor was pretty overpowering. As for my boat noodles, I'm not sure if it was the sauce they gave me to put on top, but the dish had an overwhelming smell and flavor of lemongrass. I may be a little off about the exact flavor but it made the dish almost inedible. The thing is that some people might really love these unique flavors, but they just weren't for us. You won't find typical Americanized Asian dishes on this menu. That means leave your picky friends and kids at home because they're not going to enjoy this place like someone that likes authentic Asian food. Give me some sweet and sour chicken and a boat of rice and I'm a happy camper, but this is much deeper and more unique than that so it just comes down to this:  If you're a foodie and you love authentic and wild dishes, you'll like this place. If you're picky like me and the only vegetable you eat is fries, then I would suggest a place like Gimbu 01 or Hasaki.",

When I arrived I learned that I had ordered from the one on providence road. So word to the wise either look up the street address, ask on the phone or google Deejai Noddle Bar. The two restaurants have slightly different menus so I had to reorder my food.       I wasn't upset with the staff working, it's not their fault I ordered from the wrong place but over all they need to be more clear on the phone or website to avoid this problem in the future.        I ordered the drunken noodles. You can order on a scale from 0-5 spiciness. I ordered a 1 and it still had a little kick. I was very excited to try the pineapple in the dish, but I did not see any nor taste any pineapple. However if you are a basil fan it is very prevalent and tasty. Overall I wasn't thrilled with my meal. It was very veggie/ chicken heavy and light on the noodles.",

    "text": "Deejai NoDa is still in it's infancy, not even had a grand opening yet, but is already producing stellar dishes in a pretty cool space.   I'll get the less-than-positive over with, and both gripes aren't with the restaurant itself. The first is the location by the train. It's going to get loud and congested, especially when the train goes by. That will back traffic up, they need to finish up construction there to have an easy out - it doesn't exist right now. The second is the parking lot, or really lack thereof. For both Crown Central and Deejai, there are less than 15 parking spots. That ain't gonna cut it in a month. Maybe there's a lot that I didn't see, but it should be worked on.  Okay, on to the positivity :)  Deejai NoDa has a lounge type feel, with a gorgeous bar, light wooden tables, modern light fixtures, and fun music playing in the background. We were seated and greeted immediately (the place had maybe only 5 parties being served, but I'm still grateful for attentive service). First glance, huge menu! Really impressive the amount of cool dishes they have. They also have a separate sushi menu, dessert, and a saki-based cocktail menu (all on my list to try). Our waiter was kind and gave his recommendations. Against my better judgement, we skipped appetizers, but went straight for the entrees: I ordered the Spicy Basil Chicken (default spice level 3) and The Lady ordered the Pad Thai (spice level 2). They came out and the presentation was gorgeous, hers more than mine, adorned with a flower and fresh ingredients with bright colors. The aroma coming from mine was incredible. It comes with ground chicken, red peppers, green beans, a side bowl of white rice, basil, and the broth/juices. For such a simple dish, the flavors were phenomenal, and the spice level was just right. AND it was basically 2 portions, the other is sitting, crying for me right now in the fridge. Don't worry buddy, I'll take care of you soon. Our waiter also brought me a sample of their house-made hot sauce, which was like a citrusy sambal paste. When the check came, we got mints, which is an acceptable alternative to fortune cookies. I love mints.  For the price, quantity and quality of food, service, and variety of menu items, Deejai earns a well-deserved spot on my 5 star list. I can't wait to see what they do come grand opening time.   Side note: The coffee shop/bar next door looks SO cool! And you can bring over your food from Deejai to sit and eat while looking out the bay doors on Bold Missy, or the lightrail construction? If that floats your boat...",

    "text": "I had to check out the place after a few people mentioned that Deejai had a new location. Although to be fair, I'm not sure if this noodle bar is in any way affiliated with Deejai Thai here in Charlotte. Either way, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were not located on the main strip in NoDa (parking can be hell).   Despite not being on the main strip, the parking was still atrocious. I actually ended up pulling out a parking lot entrance that lead to a dead-end because the parking lot was too tight with huge SUV's blocking people in. Sorry, it isn't 2003, didn't those go out of style when gas sky-rocketed to $5 in the late 2000's?  The staff here were extremely sweet and friendly. They are definitely out to please and welcome guests as if it were their home. Originally ordered the pad thai which came out way too sweet. They use a premade sauce and to be honest having had pad thai around the world including multiple trips to Thailand, it was some of the worst I have ever had. Period.   The staff very graciously allowed me to change my order to a basil noodle which came out way better. Still a tad bit on the sweet side and a bit 'wet', but I'm sure for most American palates it would be considered 'a-ok'.   So long story short don't come here expecting traditionally prepared dishes that will standup to your experiences traveling. However, if you are craving americanized asian noodles this place will hit the spot. I will definitely be going back to try out the poke almost 100% because of the amazing service.",

The edamame was cooked to perfection and salted which I so appreciate and the chicken was delicious! It was quite spicy so I'll probably order a level 2 next time but I was not disappointed in the level 3 at all. The place is cute and felt very clean. My one complaint was how long it took us to get the food. There were 2 or 3 other people there before we ordered and it still took our order more than30 minutes to get to us. We finally had to ask for it. We also had to ask for the check twice. We really wanted to order dessert, but didn't feel we had the time as we had somewhere we needed to be.  So I definitely recommend this place for the food, but don't recommend it if you have somewhere you need to be in less than an hour.",

The city has a decent selection of food... but after living in Milwaukee/Chicago for 15 years, I always felt some of the food was lacking - in particular, Thai food and sushi.  There are a few places around,  but until Deejai came along there was NO good Thai in Charlotte, and the good sushi was also, sadly, very spendy (at least for Charlotte).  Deejai has solved this problem...  and the new location in Noda is walking distance from our house. As a result, my wife and I have ripped through just about everything on their menu and nothing disappoints.  All of the sushi rolls are delish...  and noodle bowl favourites include Nam Prick, Drunken Noodles, and even \"plain old\" Pad Thai is fantastic the way they do it.  Always great, fresh ingredients and always as spicy as you want (or don't want).  Service is always solid and friendly, and although they don't have a ton of tap beers, they do rotate the ones they do have - usually local craft favourites. We can always find something we like to drink there.",

We got the pork tacos and edamame to start, and she brought us this cilantro sauce and another chili one. Both were delicious!! And we loved the pork tacos. For dinner, my husband got the green curry and I got the Three Amigos poke bowl. We both were very happy with our choices and we left very satisfied with our choices.

We got a groupon here and initially thought that it was for the location on Providence Rd. but I honestly think this location is even better than the original.  We started with the spring rolls - these were hot and cripsy and the sauce that comes with them is sooo good, I could put that on everything.  For our entrees, we ordered the Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai.  I didn't love the Drunken Noodles - they come at a recommended level 3 spicy out of 5 which was much too spicy for me.  You can actually ask that it come less spicy but that is what is recommended.  The Pad Thai is wonderful! So flavorful, not too sweet.  Comes with lots of peanuts which really makes the dish for me.  For dessert I had the mango sticky rice.  It is SO good!  I have never had it before but thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's a mix of savory and sweet - a must try if you have never had it before. My only complaint would be that the service was quite slow, maybe they need more servers working.",

I was very excited to come here, since I LOVE Thai food & my friends and family have been telling me how good Deejai Thai was! I ordered the Iced Thai milk tea and the salmon curry. I don't like my thai milk tea super sweet, so this was really good. The salmon curry was delicious!! The flavor was banging, I just wish the salmon wasn't too dry/over cooked but nevertheless it was still super good!

There 2 stars is a little spicy so keep that in mind but it was just right for the Pad See You!   I will return for lunch and try another dish when I am in the area.",

    "text": "Very disappointing lunch experience at Deejai NoDa. Bartender on staff the day I dined was clearly very inexperienced as our table needed to return 3 undrinkable cocktails - both on and off menus drinks. The waitress who dropped the drinks off at our table even stated that the Long Islands 'may not be okay,' and they weren't. My friend ordered from the lunch menu which was listed as coming with sweet tea and salad. They were out of salad AND she was charged for the sweet tea. When she asked the waitress why, the waitress said she got the 'dinner portion' so the tea wasn't included. We pointed out that it was 1pm and my friend showed her on the lunch menu where it listed that the tea and salad were included, but the waitress continued to argue for several minutes and told my friend she would need to pay for the tea. Also, the heat was broken and it was incredibly uncomfortable. My noodle dish was one of the worst I've had in Charlotte - and I've been eating noodles in CLT for 10 years. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The 2 stars are for the excellent black and white photos of boxers hanging in the restaurant.",

There is a $10 lunch special featuring 6 or 7 different dishes that come with a spring roll and a drink.  I ordered the drunken noodles this time, which came out fast and looked great.  They tasted as good as they looked, especially with the house cilantro lime hot sauce which added some delightful acidity. Both my coworkers were equally pleased with their Pad Thai and namprik.  There was so much food on the plate it was easily enough for two meals.  We took boxes of leftovers home with us.  For what we paid, it feels like one of the best lunch specials in town.  The wait staff is very attentive and helpful and our server even gave us drinks in to go cups at her suggestion.  It's in a bit of an out of the way corridor of NoDa near the construction, but very much worth the trip for the price and value.  There is parking in a lot out front which is very convenient.  I would definitely make this a destination for lunch, and dinner as well!",
