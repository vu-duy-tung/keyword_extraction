Felt that the prices were pretty high for what you get, $10  for even a California roll, that was about the same size as a place that does it for much less. Atmosphere was nice and service was good. Probably will just go to my go-to place in the future but was not a bad experience at all.",

All of which were good! The chicken teriyaki felt light despite being on a bowl of rice. As this was our first time we received complimentary shrimp and pork dumplings which I would get again, for sure. Our server Tiffany was awesome and so nice! She made the whole experience easy! Lots of parking available but also right off the light rail so you can walk, bike, or ride the rail to get there.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places to take people is O-Ku. O-Ku is a nice sushi/asian bistro that has the most fresh seafood in Charlotte. They serve sushi, rice, tartar and other asian foods. One of my favorite parts is the atmosphere. It is an old brick building that has been turned into something so beautiful. The dimmed lighting and few decorations give it a clean simplicity. The service is also top notch. Every time we have been the waiters/waitresses have been very attentive and able to assist with any question you have on the menu. When ordering, I suggest ordering family style and getting a bunch of dishes to split. They have plenty of small plate options and sushi that is a good portioned roll to share. On of may favorites was the tuna tartar. I am all about tuna when it comes to sushi and it is so fresh at O-ku so anything that has tuna... GET IT! If you are looking for a nice date night out or a place to take the family when they are in town. Head on over to O-Ku.",

The atmosphere was great and everyone was so welcoming! We got sat right away and our waiter came rather quickly with our drinks. We tried the southend shrimp, salmon tartar, and the yellowtail carpaccio for appetizers. Let me tell you they were delicious!! The shrimp was my favorite. If you love spicy that is the way to go!! For entrees we got the uni pasta, chicken teriyaki and the mermaid roll! We were stuffed. Not only were they delicious but they were very satisfying. The manager came to our table and introduced himself. He gave us the appetizers on the HOUSE. It was unreal. They really do take good care of their customers. We loved it and will definitely come back but with a larger crowd for sure!",

The Salmon and Lemon Roll was kind of weird tasting and we didn't even finish it. The Miso soup was also good as were the cocktails, especially the Lychee Martini.

    "text": "Tried O-Ku for the first time with my family since I was visiting from CA this weekend, and was getting tired of eating so much Southern bbq, hehe.   TLDR; the sushi is fresh and well prepared, but portions are small for the price. Great for a date, group parties and special occasions.   Upon entering the restaurant a friendly host and waitress seated us almost immediately and took our drink orders. I was impressed by the cool ambiance and modern decor of the interior. Not many people on a Sunday evening at 6:30p, surprisingly.  Our waitress Rachel did a lovely job and accommodated my non-English speaking parents just fine. We weren't sure how much to order and my dad generally doesn't eat very much, so we started off with two special rolls, a maki roll, and an appetizer (sashimi tacos) to share between three people. We soon discovered that we hadn't ordered enough, so added another sashimi taco and a tuna wrapped roll.   Mermaid roll - deep fried and tasty though not spectacular. I liked how it was lightly crisp and not overly battered.   Salmon lemon roll - neatly prepared roll with salmon on the exterior that seemed fresh. the bit of lemon is a nice touch. The rest of the roll is like a simple California roll and while it tasted great, I wish I got something more interesting for what I paid.    Yellowtail maki - good. It's exactly what you would expect.   Tuna wrapped roll - tasty and satisfying. I'm a sucker for eel sauce and spicy mayo so this met my expectations just fine. Fish was good and well proportioned.   Sashimi taco - not that exciting. tasted mostly like pico de Gallo salsa with a hint of fish. terribly small portions and not a whole lot of flavor.   Overall the rolls and fish were well done and tasted fine. I just don't think it was incredibly memorable, creative, or even filling. Perhaps it's better they don't overdo it on the sushi rice, but at the same time it seemed like the portions were a bit scant for the price. You're paying for ambiance and location, I suppose. I did appreciate that they had uni pasta on the menu even though I didn't order it.   Parking is easy at Atherton Mills. 3 stars for solid service and food, but lacks anything special for the price.",

    "text": "Wonderful! I find Oku to be 5 stars in all respects; Food, service, drinks! I apologize for the mammoth review in advance but this place deserves it!  First off, 2 tips to make a great experience at Oku. First, call and make a reservation. Sometimes it can take 45 to get a table even on a weekday... Watch out for Mondays/Wednesdays (5pm-7pm) as it can get especially crowded because of the BOGO sushi rolls happy hour! Second, sit at the sushi bar! It's great because you can talk to the Chefs; they're super knowledgeable about their craft! However, it is a tight squeeze so a minor trade off for the experience. Purse hooks under the bar btw  For a night, I'd have to recommend the Uni Pasta, Nigiri, and Yellowtail Carpaccio. (detailed reviews below) However, honestly, everything on the menu is so good. You can't go wrong!   If I had to pick one dish, UNI PASTA. It's mind blowing. The dish really brings out the flavor of Uni (which is unique I admit) and it complements well with the candied bacon and the creamy pasta. Candied Bacon OP. I always get two of this dish, If you're up for new things, I highly recommend this.   2nd Favorite: The specialty nigiri. Absolutely must try the salmon with the creme fraiche. The garnish highlights the salmon beautifully and everything melts together in your mouth. Hamachi/Yellowtail nigiri...excellent flavor. the serrano pepper adds a nice bite. Tuna with the togarashi is also fantastic but probably my least favorite nigiri. (This speaks to how excellent the other nigiri were.) The snapper with the yuzu tobiko was good and very bright in flavor. Also, chef recommended not dipping in soy sauce b/c he preps it already.  3rd. Yellowtail carpaccio...an excellent dish. I've seen it done a couple of times before but the mango garnish really adds something special to the taste of the dish. Again, another extremely well thought out dish. I can't recommend it enough. This dish does go quickly though but I still absolutely think it's worth it.   Rolls: Black Magic (specialty)...this is great for someone who wants something a little different. the presentation is really cool (rice is black). not my favorite roll though despite the lobster and cool appearance factor!  Salmon Lemon Roll...because of the lemon flavor, this is a very fresh tasting roll, this for those who don't like sushi covered with sauce and just want to taste the fish. I consider it a basic, simple roll. Potato Roll...unique roll bc of  shoestring potatoes. You'd think it would be heavy but it's not! Paired with the eel sauce, it is a savory sushi! One of my favorites to share because it's quite filling Mermaid Roll... the scallops add an amazing touch. I think this is a good dish to understand the innovation that comes from the sushi chefs. it's a savory sushi and it's a very cohesive taste. Tuna Wrapped: Add Serrano pepper to it!! It creates a delicious flavor combo! But only if you don't mind the bite of the pepper!  Spicy Rainbow: My absolute favorite roll so far! Filled with lump crab, and topped with fresh fish, and multicolored tobiko, this roll is just packed with flavor. A combination of fresh and savory, I think the taste is just fantastic. The sushi chef explained to me each colored tobiko piece has it's own flavor. Yellow for citrus, green for wasabi infused, and black/red for the traditional tobiko flavor. It's quite subtle but an excellent innovation.  Chef Specials:  Duck Buns...a great dish. It's kind of a take on Peking Duck and very savory! My least favorite special but again, that speaks to the quality of the other dishes.  Steak Tartare...I think this dish is interesting. probably one of the only dishes that didn't blow my mind White Fish Crudo...another piece of innovation from the chefs. it combines olive oil and lemon to highlight the fish in the dish. it doesn't seem like it'd work but it comes together nicely South End Shrimp...just get it. you won't regret this savory dish! Lobster Temaki...my second favorite chef special! the hand roll really brings out the flavor of the lobster. there's nothing flashy on this dish. It's so comforting. it's just plain simple honest lobster, seaweed, rice, and greens. it sounds simple but again, soo soo good! #1 is Yellowtail Carpaccio!    Drinks:  I had the Lychee Martini, Cherry Soda Mocktail, & Lychee Soda. All were excellent though the cherry soda was my favorite! Yuzu Mule is a new favorite!",

The only downside was that they had reservations on reservations so I had to sit at a community table with my boyfriend.   Aside from that, the sushi was buy one half off, so we got two separate rolls each and they filled us up with no worries and my boyfriend knows how to EAT. One of the rolls my boyfriend got was a potato roll, and he stated how he liked how unique it was and that it would be a good roll for anyone who wanted sushi but didn't want fish or any type of protein in the roll.   The ambience of the restaurant was so sleek and modern, it honestly felt like fine dining for a much easier price.   My advice to you is if you want a table, call for a reservation and make sure you have adequate time for parking. The restaurant is in the corner of a shopping center with limited parking spaces near it, so be prepared to walk a little.",

I have moved this spot to my list of sexy atmosphere specialty places to go for cocktails and apps with a group. But I'll grab a snack first so I don't spend a small fortune to get full!",

We tried the miso soup and edamame with truffle oil as an appetizer. Both very good.  For the entree we tried the hot and heavy sushi roll, spider roll, and  mermaid roll.   Our favorite was the hot and heavy roll. It has a full lobster tail inside. Very filling roll. Overall great experience. Will definitely come back.",

Easy to find on the side of Atherton Mill and easy to park as well, although they do offer a valet service. The ambiance oozes cool. Uplit branches, dark lighting, servers all in black, and few touches that say \"Yea, I'm also a japanese restaurant too\". Prices are on the high side, but not like..unreasonably high. Just not-every-week high.  Everything was to share, because that's how we do sushi. That's how everybody should do sushi. Our order: Appetizer: O-Ku Spring Roll. Filled with fish and fresh veggies, and this sweet peanut sauce that I just wanted to pour on everything. Rolls: Potato Roll. This was a really cool take on a fried roll, it had a fried potato 'crust' on the outside and well done fish on the inside.  Mermaid Roll: Tempura fried and the only \"warm\" sushi on our plate, it melted in your mouth.  Spider Roll: There's torched salmon on the top and that alone makes this roll worth it. Definitely would get again. Yellowtail Hamachi: Laid on a basil pesto and had a thin slice of serrano pepper on top. This order will change depending on the quality of the fish, but ours...man. Awesome. This was good fish.  Our service was also excellent; our waitress explained everything in great detail as well as why certain things paired well with eachother. It was a pleasure eating at O-Ku and I can't wait to do it again.",

From the get-go, service was very slow, from seating us to a waitress coming for drink and food orders. I wouldn't have minded the leisurely feel, but it was after 8pm and we were both starving.  Service aside, I just wasn't impressed by the sushi there. Our waitress recommended the rainbow roll, and it barely had any seafood wrapped on the outside of the roll. I'm guessing the fish in it was about to go bad so they were trying to sell it off. We ordered a couple of veggie rolls as well to split, and the avocado roll was pretty yummy but the tempura got two thumbs down from me (although the fella liked it). The tempura veggie just had some fried squash wrapped in a roll which I found to be really odd. The fella also ordered the wagyu nigiri, which he said was quite good.  The menu had promise and the atmosphere felt expensive and intimate, which I liked. So, I'd be willing to try Oku again and order something different, but we got off to a rocky start with mediocre sushi.",

Well just heads up come on Monday and Wednesday night between 5-7 pm because it is 1/2 most their sushi. Eight pieces come in most and I tried three different rolls.  **Spicy crunch tuna was my favorite.   I have to say the texture and taste were on point( so in normal terms for some people it was very tasty) There was the right blend and not too much sauce added on top like some places.   In addition, the sushi tasted fresh and that is the most important to me because when you taste bad sushi it can turn you off from eating it for a long time.   I would go back again even on \"regular\" price as the atmosphere is very nice and a good date if you are looking for a date night.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been wanting to check this place out for a bit now. We finally decided on a date night on Saturday. The only reservation time was 9:45, so we booked it!   The layout in O-KU is very nice and open. We chose to sit at the sushi bar to watch the action. I am wondering if their reservation system was correct cause it didn't look like it was that slammed (aka, there should have been reservations open before 9:45).  I settled on the bourbon strawberry drink and my husband got a glass of sake. My cocktail was fantastic! Nice flavors!  Since we had a 9:45 reservation, we had been to one place before this. Thus, we were just going to order a few things. Our waitress kept pressuring us to order more. I was a bit disappointed by this experience because, after we did not order more, she never returned (actually, that is a lie, as she returned to bring the check.). She spent all her time on the guys beside us who were going to town and ordering half the menu. Literally, other people filled up our water and brought us stuff. One waitress was in particularly sweet and amazing. I grabbed her name at the end cause she was that awesome: Zoey. However, our actual assigned waitress was easily one of the worst I have had ever had.  We ordered the salmon tar tar (side note: I asked our waitress whether she liked the tuna tar tar better or the salmon tar tar. Her answer was \"well, you should pick based on whether you like salmon or tuna\".....no joke yall. Sorry, I am probably being harsh here, as maybe she was just having a bad day), the tuna wrapped roll, and the mermaid roll. The salmon tar tar was absolutely fantastic. Beautiful presentation with the quail egg on top. Absolute deliciousness and is my second favorite tar tar dish in the city now!! Unfortunately, it went slightly down from there. The tuna wrapped roll was pretty good. Nothing amazing but definitely tasted fresh. My hubby liked it a lot though. The mermaid roll was a big dud. Like 75% rice and super bland tasting.   The bill compared to the food was not proportionate. I left just feeling very underwhelmed. 2.5 star review rounded up for cool restaurant layout and a super delish appetizer!  However, will absolutely return a bit more down the line to see if these kinks are worked out and will update my review then!",

They eventually allowed her to order a roll without shrimp but when it arrived to the table, it still had the shrimp in it. Thankfully her husband noticed.   On another note, this place is NOT kid friendly. I had my 2 month old daughter with me, and I was disappointed that there was no changing table!",

(not great and not bad.)  the $21 squid ink sushi roll doesnt have the aroma it should.  it's a very basic box sushi with no fresh fish in it.  a little bit overpriced.  the rolls are comparable to other sushi joints, even I can compare them with new Zealand cafe (not that they are great).  avg at best.  I'm pretty picky about the service.  we need to flag the server, and ask the busser to get us our server when she was filling out water.  otherwise, the server would camp out by the sushi bar and do his chit chat.  we sat around the hostess stand and all three hostesses were playing their phones...  this place supposed to be top notch in service?  I donno.  the interior is very nice and no wait for us, which is a plus.  I just dont get the hype of this place.  it just an avg quality restaurant but with good decor and marketing imho.  I'd probably will be back on their mon/wed special, otherwise, I won't miss this place.",

I'm always on the hunt for good sushi and I just found it.   Like other posters have said the restaurant does have a great vibe, similar to the original. When it gets going, I'm sure this will be the place to see and be seen. The service was so good, it was almost too much. Our meal was probably 45 minutes start to finish because the food came so fast and we were too hungry to linger! I mentioned on Open Table that we were celebrating a promotion and every single person congratulated us and we got 2 glasses of champagne on the house. What's funny is it seemed like they were congratulating my husband when it was my celebration dinner. With a name like Aleks, it could've been either one of us so I'm giving them a pass.   We shared the dumpling app and 3 rolls.I would skip the potato roll next time. Fish in all three was really good and fresh tasting. I can't wait to come back during Happy Hour now that I work nearby!",

    "text": "I came here for the first time for a friends birthday dinner. The ambiance was great and the place sets a nice mood. Started with Gyoza which was pretty tasty. I had ordered a couple edamame for the table that came out well after the gyoza(I think the waiter forgot). I got two spicy tuna hand rolls for my dinner. It took forever for the food to come out, during which time a server came up and took away the edamame away without asking while some remained on the plate. When my food finally arrived it was nothing to write home about. Not a lot of tuna in the roll. During this time everyone's orders were mixed up and because of this people are at different times. Overall a little overpriced for what you get. I would probably come back and give it a second try only if it was someone else's idea.",

We continue to be blown away by the amazing service, friendliness of the staff and managers, and also the excellence and quality of the food. No other sushi spot in Charlotte can do what they do!

Maybe a little heavy with the rice (vs protein) on the rolls we ordered. Miso soup was standard.Tuna Tacos were comically small. When they came out everyone laughed. We thought that it was a joke. Knew they wouldn't be full sized taco but they were about 1.5 inches long.   Service was prompt and attentive.  Everything tasted fine and I certainly wouldn't be opposed to coming back to this spot. You are paying for the vibe and decor which are admittedly great but it is a little pricy (as most sushi places are) and there are better values out there for my money.",

The food and cocktails were excellent although I only had sushi rolls as I had heard amazing things from friends who had eaten at their Charleston location before.  The ambiance is classy but not too classy where you start feeling uncomfortable if you're not in a three piece suit.  They've done a great job with the interior as the decor and furniture are very nice, new and pleasant to the eye.  I will be a frequent visitor for sure, especially during their Mondays and Wednesdays happy hour (50% off all sushi rolls between 5p-7p).  GREAT new addition to the ever growing Charlotte restaurant scene!",

It's a beautiful interior with a great ambiance, perfect for a Friday night group or date night. We had a group of 8 that was coordinated easily with the GM, Justin. He was awesome, along with the rest of the waitstaff and hostesses. We couldn't stop gushing about how great the service was! I tried the tuna sashimi and split the spider role and the lobster hand roll (I forget the proper name). Healthy portion on the rolls, with some unique offerings. Love it here and can't wait to go back - thank you for great service and delicious food (and drinks!).",

It was a bit crowded but the atmosphere was great, and the beer I got (Sapporo) was delicious and went great with my sushi later! I was having such a great time I didn't keep track of time but it definitely didn't seem like 45 minutes before we were seated. They still gave us a free appetizer to \"apologize for our wait\" though!  Sit at the sushi bar if possible! This is where we were seated and it was the best location in the restaurant. We were on the far end so we watched all the sushi and appetizers line up on the bar as they came out of the kitchen--they all looked delicious! We asked the waiters questions about the dishes we saw a few times and they were very kind and knowledgeable.   The food itself was amazing! The free appetizer they gave us was the whitefish crudo, and we ordered south end shrimp as well. I would highly recommend both! I also ordered two rolls. I loved the lemon salmon roll. I worked at a sushi restaurant for 3 years in college so I've had more than my fair share of sushi and it was both delicious and unique enough to impress me. I also got the potato roll. The fried potato flavor was delicious but definitely overwhelming and I couldn't taste too much of the other flavors. It was still good and would be a great choice for a tentative new sushi eater. With the appetizers two rolls was too much for me to finish and they boxed my leftovers up nicely with extra soy sauce, ginger and wasabi. I think two rolls or an appetizer and a roll would be a filling meal for most!  Overall the ambiance, service and best of all food was great! I'll definitely be coming again.",

Not only are their rolls inventive and delicious, but their sashimi lets the freshness and quality of their ingredients shine. We had the spring rolls (could have eaten anything covered in the sauce that comes with it), a spider roll, rainbow roll, and black magic in addition to some of the best sashimi salmon either of us have ever had. Mark the manager was so kind and really made our Sunday night out fun. We felt very well cared for by him and our waiter (Adrian...?). So happy to have you guys in the neighborhood and can't wait to come back again! You might have dethroned our former favorite sushi place... :)",

So this week I had a customer come to town and took him and my partner.  We went early (~5:30) because we were going to a hornets game afterwards.  I assumed I wouldn't need a reservation at that early hour but when we arrived the hostess said she could only seat us at the sushi bar.  I called her bluff and said we'd go somewhere else and the manager who happened to be standing next to her seated us at a table.  We ordered a some apps, which were good but teeny tiny, and the sushi was fine but I don't think I could take a pepsi challenge against any other sushi place in town if you took off the fancy presentation.  As expected with cocktails, sake, wine, and 3 hungry diners the bill was astronomical (and the rolls were half off!).  If you're looking to keep costs down stay away from the nigiri.  I'm not a sucker for high end experience and prefer a more casual environment.  Ru-san's is my favorite in Charlotte and I'd go there over this place any time.",

Our server start dishing insults immediately calling one of our friends Viola Davis and then tried fluttering with her later in the evening.   Our sushi came out and none of us could locate the avocado on the roll which we brought to our server attention.  As conversation continued farmer felt it was his job to censor me and inform us our conversation isn't appropriate for the restaurant. Repeatedly telling me he was serious and if the place was packed we wouldn't be allowed to talk .  Our group of MD's were having a discuss about vagina research for the record.   We called over the manager and she informed us they have regular issues with farmer and his mouth.    There are too many places to try in CLT that offer better service and above par staff.   Go try the food but avoid FARMER at all cost.   Guess O-ku has rules of engagement.",

    "text": "Should have known better when the hostess at the front said \"the server on that side is a little overwhelmed\". Arrived 5 minutes late to half price sushi on a Wednesday and did not get the special. Ordered sushi, cocktails, and appetizers. Appetizers and cocktails came promptly but after 45 mins of no sushi, I asked the server to cancel the order as we had to leave for another event. The server said that the sushi was on its way and could not be canceled. Could not believe myself. Not coming back for awhile. Overpriced and lack of good service is evident. Don't be fooled by upscale environment.",

    "text": "We arrived just after 5:30 pm as we wanted to avoid a wait for a table.  Even though the restaurant was almost empty, we were seated at a less than desirable table.  Shortly thereafter, two other groups were seated flanking our table and within ear shot with most of the very large room still empty.  Why cram everyone into one small corner of the restaurant?   Sure, it makes things easier for staff but we are paying to dine out and wish to enjoy the experience.   The music was uncomfortably loud.  We asked if it could be turned down and were immediately told, \"probably not\".  Why?  There were less than ten people in the whole place.  Who would care if the music was less than blasting?   We ordered 3 of the specialty items.  The first two were very tasty.  The third was overpriced and somewhere between \"meh\" and \"yuck\".  I know this place is all the rage but I totally don't get it.  We left hungry but decided to cut our losses and leave as we were just annoyed by the attitude of the wait staff and the less than desirable overall experience.",

I was in town from Miami on a forced trip due to a hurricane, but lucky to have family in NC to welcome us. I don't know Charlotte well at all, so I depended on other Yelp reviews and the approval of my little brother who actually lives in the city. We had an early bird dinner reservation at 6:30pm on a Monday after learning of the half off sushi happy hour till 7pm. My folks were treating us so I tried to be mindful when choosing a dining venue. The restaurant by far exceeded expectations. Our server Jennifer was very attentive and super sweet. She sent two appetizers on the house as a birthday treat and thoroughly explained the menu as it was our first visit. The sushi was of great quality, the decor was inviting and the service top notch. I will definitely remember the experience next time I'm in the Charlotte area.",

    "text": "Wow what a pleasant surprise. Just moved to Charlotte this afternoon and decided to walk outside and grab a quick dinner when we stumbled into the soft opening of O-Ku. The wine pairing was great and slightly unusual in that we had South African and Oregon wines that were crisp, different (from the usual standards), and delicious. We split Spicy Edamame (yummy but not markedly unusual), Ceviche Tacos ( nice presentation and very flavorful), and Miso soup. For the main course we had the Mermaid Roll (fresh with a new twist), Potato Roll (the winner of the evening!!), and Curry Duck (large portion cooked perfectly with unusual type of eggplant). The service was excellent from the hostess, server Megan, and manager Justin. The ambiance was very nice in such an old eclectic building and the indirect lighting and lighting fixtures really set the tone for a cozy evening. They plan on having half price sushi happy hours Monday and Wednesday and we definitely plan on returning.  What a great evening. So happy to know that we can walk outside Ashton South End and enjoy such a nice (and healthy) evening. Thank you O-Ku!",

First of all...the atmosphere is incredible. High energy, great decor. The use of up-lighting to highlight and illuminate is spectacular. The spacing is cozy, yet sufficient. I felt completely immersed in all the action. Now, the food. I work in the restaurant industry. I love food and this place did not dissapoint. In fact, it elevated my palette and sent me into sensory over load. The edamame  with pink Himalayan salt and black truffle oil is amazing. The curry duck breast is divine and the lobster and wild mushroom cooked table side is an incredible presentation and delicious as well. You have to have some sushi. The sushi plates are beautiful and taste even better then they look. The A5 Wagyu Nigiri is the most amazing bite of food that has ever entered my mouth. I will be back soon and often...many more things I want to try. I suggest making a reservation, this place gets packed.",

Thanks to my Open Table reservations, we were seated right away this time (plus we arrived way early!).  I've always liked the ambiance here (especially the cool, high ceilings), but my hubby wasn't too impressed.  No matter, as expected, we both thoroughly enjoyed the food.  I was especially blown over by their specialty \"Aka Sansai\", this Squid Seaweed Salad...Amazing!!  Their sushi/maki rolls were really good...no complaint...BUT, I will say that I've been to other Japanese restaurants in town with bigger selections, with just as high quality ingredients...and even fancier presentation.  Think my only real complaint is in their drinks.  First off, their tap water tasted weird...had that very raw taste to it...which was quite bad. Then they lacked the most basic drink selection, like Iced Tea, for instance.  I actually opted for one of their non-alcoholic drinks...and what I ordered was quite disappointing (very tiny glass).  I'll know better to opt for a better cocktail next time.  The meal ended on a good note...with a delicious Coconut flavored Creme Brulee.  They have a great dessert selection, and it was actually tough to choose just one!  Lastly, the service was really good, from start to finish...and they actually bothered to read my Open Table detailed requests (that this was indeed a special occasion and that I wanted to be seated away from bathrooms and doorways!) lol.  This is definitely one of my top 5 Japanese restaurants in town, and I definitely intend to return and try a few more items on their menu.",

We didn't bother asking them to switch it out for what we ordered  since it took so long to come out. We tried to order hot sake and the waiter suggested a premium sake bottle instead- starting at $40 a bottle. He just seemed really intent on upselling us at every turn even when we tried to order something specific he would try to redirect us.

The o-ku spring roll is fresh and a great way to start the meal, though the soy sauce reduction was a bit grainy. I had two rolls, the mermaid and the very light and fresh salmon-lemon.  But my favorite of the evening was the tuna tart! I am a huge fan of truffle oil so it might be an acquired taste for some.   The only drawback of the evening was how quickly and easily it was to spend money as most of the items are $15+ and that some sake is not available Unless you buy the bottle.",

I decided to chance the establishment.   I'm a simple man - no need to be \"woo'd\" by fancy lights or folded napkins. But there is a taste to the ambiance of O-Ku. It is an intimate aesthetic, but a lively energy that challenges your very understanding of this sentence. A staff that truly makes you feel welcomed, heard, and understood. The food was high above expectation. Beautiful cuts of fish paired with citrus for the yellowtail. Wonderfully flavorful rolls with balance of boldness and precision. The knowledgeable bartender even recommended a cocktail to pair with my bourbon-driven palette.   All in all, I owed my vegan friend an apology. The friendliness, the cuisine, the \"vibe\" (if I may,) abolished just a touch of my cynicism... And I've never been happier.",

She recommended most of our dishes and saki, and everything was nothing short of perfect. Every taste, every flavor was delectable. The sushi chefs were also incredibly sweet and friendly (we sat at the sushi bar) so much so that we ended up tipping them as well. I don't think myself or my boyfriend have ever had a better experience than we did here.  Despite the restaurant being extremely busy, we were still treated with the utmost attention and our meal couldn't have been any better. Worth every penny!",

It was still mostly empty but it was fine because all of our food came out exceptionally fast.   They gave us yellowtail carpaccio on the house for my birthday, which I think was a nice gesture. The fish was thinly sliced and very tender with great flavor. We ordered 3 rolls for 2 people: the kiwi kani roll, potato roll, and the mermaid roll - the last two were fried and pretty crispy. All the rolls were delicious and very flavorful. My favorite was the mermaid roll but it only came with 6 pieces. The potato roll was interesting and good as well. The kiwi goes well wish sushi but it was more bland compared to the other two.   The star of the dinner was dessert: our server recommended the coconut creme brulee, and it did not disappoint. If you love coconut, order this!!! So good.  The inside is kind of too dark - group next to us had to use their phone flashlights to read the menu...  But service overall was great and I'd come back any day, if not just for the creme brulee.",

Just to mention a few: -Amaebi (sweet shrimp): Usually a delight, but was almost tasteless -Ikura: Marinated in too much sake that overpowered the distinct ikura flavor -Hamachi: Flavorless  It felt like the fish was pre-cut, frozen, and then just thawed before putting it on the rice and serving it. Not sure if that happened, but if would explain the bland flavor.   The restaurant has, however, a nice atmosphere and good drinks. I would come here again, but only for drinks and stay away from the sushi.",

Most items they offer are a very modern take on stuff you're used to seeing in other establishments, so modern it hardly looks or tastes the same as what you're expecting.  This is not a bad thing; just saying that you need to come here with no expectations.   The menu here is very pricey so, if your main objective is a decent sushi dinner, come when they are offering their half-off special.  Otherwise, save your money and go elsewhere.  You pay for the atmosphere and experience here.  This is a great place if you're in the mood for a unique experience or want to take someone out for a very nice dinner.  The food here was small but delicious portions.  Everyone in our party of 6 was happy with their meals.

    "text": "I had avoided this place for a while because I wanted the \"hype\" to die down and for me to get a proper experience at O-ku.  Solid 4 stars, not only because it's a sushi place in SouthEnd, but a really decent one at that.  On a Monday evening, the dinner rush was pretty crazy.  Luckily I was having an early dinner with my sister so we went around 5:30.  Greeted promptly and seated, we decided to go on a sushi journey through the O-ku menu.  I do want to note that all food items come out as they are prepared so you may get your rolls before appetizers/ chef specialties.... so just come hungry and have an open mind.  Our server was friendly enough and walked us through the menu.  We decided on edamame with truffle oil, SouthEnd shrimp, tuna wrapped roll, and nigiri:  yellowtail, tuna, and otoro.  We ended our meal with a chocolate bento box dessert.  Everything was exceptional and we left with full bellies.  Couldn't help but notice how busy the restaurant became (on a Monday night!).  So I take that as a good sign.  Atherton Mill is undergoing some changes, but O-ku should be here to stay and it will be interesting how they do during the demolition/construction of the rest of the mill.  Currently there are ample parking spaces and complementary valet if you don't feel like walking.  Personally I don't ever valet if I don't have to - luckily I can just walk here so the poor valet people don't have to drive my prius around the block (in disappointment that its not a sports car).  Definitely coming back to try more items off the menu!",

We walked in around 5:30pm on a week day. There were still plenty of tables available but I thought it was weird that the two hostesses asked for my brother's full name before assigning us a table.  We were seated at one of the front windows which was nice because the lighting is pretty dim in there. Our server greeted us warmly and explained the menu to us since it was both our first time here. The menu was concise and easy to follow. I like how items come out tapas style. We started with the Edamame with Pink Himalayan Salt and Truffle Oil (yum), followed by the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll (also yum and the roll was the right size and not overstuffed), then two pieces each of nigiri: salmon, hamachi, and the O-Ku style Bluefin Otoro. The pieces were fresh, not overwhelmed with rice or wasabi, and delicious. I liked how there was a option to just get traditional nigiri/sashimi or try one of their seasoned pieces. The last dish to come out was the South End Shrimp. The flavors were good but the shrimp were drowned in sauce so it wasn't crispy anymore. Least favorite dish.   I was impressed they had a dessert selection. We split the Chocolate Bento Box. The cake was warm and fluffy accompanied by three mini scoops of green tea ice cream. I was expecting more fruit based on the description but it was only one strawberry.  Glad O-Ku is within walking distance so I can come again the next time I'm in town.",

Since all the makimono rolled sushi was half-off we decided to order two rolls: the Rainbow roll and the Dragon roll.   After the bartender found out it was my friend's first visit, the kitchen sent out an order of one of their most popular apps - the South End Shrimp. They are delicious!!! The spicy sauce and peanuts combined make such a nice flavor combination! It's definitely a good choice to start your meal! And major shout-out to the kitchen staff for treating us so nice!   The sushi rolls were both excellent! Super fresh and delicious. My favorite was the Dragon roll. I just love the tempura shrimp! If you're debating this is definitely one you should try!

Would recommend for anything from casual / romantic date to that time your family comes in town and you need to impress them with your awesome food scene in Charlotte. Our reservation was mad through Opentable app. It was for a birthday and notes were left within the app. Sasha, our waitress was very accommodating and respectful. She immediately made note to the birthday and welcomed us in. Excellent staff all around. Robert, the manager, was also incredibly personable and made it a point to make rounds to each table to ask about the experience. Something I don't expect but greatly appreciate.   Food: I'm not exactly the \"sushi guru\" in town but I thought the sushi was top notch and ranks high in any sushi in town, if not the best.  We had the potato roll (does it get any better than sushi wrapped in deep fried potatoes? I'll wait) and the spider roll. Spider roll came with torched salmon which melted in your mouth like butter. I hate the fishy taste in seafood (don't judge me at this point) so I was extra critical and skeptical. Was not disappointed. Robert gave us a great rundown on the restaurants fresh practices and differences from others in town. This will be a must try for any sushi lover.",

Everything was fantastic, but the wagyu beef wonton soup was incredible. I would skip the scallop crudo for the salmon tartare next time but it was still good. The stir fry was really good as well.

We had the cracked shrimp appetizer which might of been my favorite appetizer I've ever had at an Asian restaurant. I don't even like sashimi but we tried it anyway, and guess what? It was delicious. Top it all of the sushi was prepared fresh and we finished every bite. If you're looking for some great Asian cuisine, look no further; O-Ku is your spot.",

    "text": "An upscale sushi spot that is all-that. Arguably the finest raw seafood I  have eaten other than when I was literally standing on a dock in Japan.  I have always gone earlier in the evening so parking wasn't an issue, but they have valet, so if the little parking area is full, just let them park for you.  The atmosphere is wonderful. Music just loud enough to amp up the energy without being so loud you cannot hear. Actually the acoustics are pretty good, because even when it fills up and the noise level rises it is not insufferable like some other places.  The poke bowl app is one of my two menu favorites, with the butter poached lobster handroll being the other. I did not try the rolls, but they look very Americanized. I will stick to the melt-in-your-mouth sashimi, of which my favorites are the octopus and yellow tail.  So why not five stars?  Well, they have food runners and water-pouring people ( I don't think they are the same), and a couple of them have worn strong perfume, so when they come to the table it tends to assault the senses. I have been to the restaurant four times and it consistently happens. And, I love low-lighting for dining, but when you see even young people are having to get out their cellphone flashlights to see, maybe you could make it a tad brighter? Neither of these issues is a deal breaker, more like annoyances.  Heads up that you will drop some serious cash to eat here (my beloved lobster handroll is nearly $20 alone.)  Keep up the quality and I will pay what I need to.",

The woman filling water took her job seriously and helped the servers.  Our server also smiled and was polite.  The lighting and decorations made it feel super warm and cozy.  A perfect fit for the brick building they're located in.  The tall windows are also nice for viewing the south end traffic and people.  -Miso soup was excellent and they serve a nice portion.   -Spiced Chili Edamame was a new and worthwhile experience.  You'll get your hands dirty for sure, but the heat and flavor are well worth it.   -My group didn't know that we showed up during half price sushi happy hour, but we took full advantage and loaded up.  The flavor of the sushi was excellent.  Immediately placing it as one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Charlotte.  My one knock is that multiple rolls kind of fell apart as we dug in.  I think one mark of excellent sushi is its ability to maintain it's integrity on it's way to my mouth.  Other than that, the sushi was really good.",

    "text": "After reading great reviews from the Charleston location, and a sushi spot opening close to me, I was looking forward to checking out the new spot. I made reservations for four on Wednesday night at 6:15, after hearing they have 1/2 price sushi rolls from 5:00-7:00. We arrived at 6:15 and were seated immediately, and noticed the place was not as crowded as I expected being its first week. Needless to say, I love the atmosphere, great decor, bar and a small sushi bar in the back corner. We decided to start with the Dim Sum Platter, a mix of Shrimp Shumai and Pork Dumplings, served with ponzu sauce and sweet chili sauce. Both dumplings were good. We ordered a variety, six, of the specially rolls. All were good, but what I recall from most of them is rice. The two that stood out were the Tuna Roll and Kiwi..yes, Kiwi. I was a little hesitant at first but it was great. The least impressive was the potato roll, one of their most famous. It honestly tasted like McDonalds Hashbrowns, never again. I was also disappointed that they ran out of soft shell crab, by 6:30, so one of the rolls we wanted we could not try. Prices are high and the drink menu is limited for wines and quite pricey. Not sure I would rush back, but did enjoy the atmosphere and may stop by for a drink or 1/2 price roll again.",

I asked Justin is it normal to have the Shu Mai come out kinda cold. He immediately explains and offered a redo, or to take it off my tix. I mentioned that it's not the reason why I asked. I was curious on why.. wondering if it was supposed to be like that or was it really a mistake.. and Justin admit it was a mistake.. He offered a complimentary ice cream.. since I never tried what he have describe, why not.. this is why I gave them a 5 stars.  He is truly interested in trying to improve his restaurant if there's mistake. To me it's minor but he want to make sure everybody is happy..  I guess should I really care to tell you what I ordered it.. mayyy not.. just know that the rest of the food is good. Arrives on time. Allison was a very good waitress. The house was run very smoothly.. their drinks can be a bit strong.. check out my pics.. it look and is yummy! Go check them out!",

I was also happy to find out that all of their rolls are half off 5:30-7 Monday and Wednesday. Score!   For dinner we started with the Dumpling Dim Sum. It was served with 4 pork gyoza and 4 shrimp shimai with a side of sweet chili and fish sauce. Both were delicious.   We also ordered a variety of rolls, but my favorite was that tuna wrapped roll. The tuna was fresh and delicious. We also got the potato roll (recommended), but I wasn't blown away. It's essentially like eating a giant French fry. I personally don't care for deep fried sushi and would rather have fish instead.   The most unique roll of the right was the kiwi roll. We even saved the sweet chili sauce from the dumplings and dipped the roll in it. Game changer!!   The let down for me was surprisingly the lobster roll ($24 reg). The roll was tiny compared to the others and double in price. Other than it having lobster in it, there wasn't much to it.   Overall you can't go wrong on half off night, however I think I'll only return for half off at the bar area and for a drink or two.",

Also has the wagyu tartare which I could finish myself. We had the black magic roll and it was very good. You have to try it first without the soy sauce and wasabi to appreciate the taste.

    "text": "Celebrating a big birthday with my father meant only one thing, with Omakase at O-Ku. This was my first and recommended by my brother, we landed ourselves here. If you've never had Omakase, it's basically dishes selected by the chef. You're not going to pick and choose, it's a set meal that the chef makes. That eliminates all the indecisions, and all the complications of looking at a menu and seeing what you're interested in. For people with indecisions, this is a perfect meal and experience that should definitely be noticed.  Now, in order to get Omakase, I would definitely, DEFINITELY, call ahead as I believe you can only get 4 seats at the bar at a time. Not only are there other sushi chefs that are fulfilling other orders for the restaurant, this experience is limited.  What you'll be rewarded with your hard time of getting a spot will be a 7/8 course meal.  It ranges from some sashimi/nigiri to wagyu beef, which was what I had served with this delicious sauce. I can't speak of what you'll be served, but what I was served it was great! The price of this was $150/seat, which considering of other Omakase, that's not a bad price. If you have a special occasion and you like Japanese food, I would say go for it.",

I was excited about half price roll time, but the rolls came out as a regularly sized sushi roll except for cut in half. It was disappointing in the size category, but the taste DEFINITELY made up for it! Their service is amazing, every hostess and waiter I have ever had has been so sweet. Their chirashi bowl is my personal favorite while their sushi rolls are also amazing. I have been here three times in the past month despite the expenses! My family and I love O-Ku.",

The bartenders were incredibly friendly and helpful. I went with the bourbon basil berry lemonade and he got the shogun. Both drinks were delicious. I also feel like they're great cocktails for only $11 each.   We started with the dumpling dim sum, and it was a nice size to share. The flavor of the dumplings was great, especially the shrimp ones. We had a bunch of pieces of nigiri along with the negitoro roll and the potato roll. The nigiri was so fresh and delicious. We recently went to Japan and I was on a bit of a salmon nigiri bender while there, and the one at O-Ku took me back it was so good. The negitoro was also great, I wish it had just a little more tuna, but it was still worth it. The potato roll is more of a treat, it's a little heavy so it's nice to share, but the potato outside was crispy and awesome. The service throughout our meal was excellent and we had such a nice time. The ambience here is also dark and romantic, a nice place to relax with a drink. This will definitely be a regular sushi spot for us!",

He then screwed up the martini order and after a long wait, he even ended up spilling one drink on the table. Ordered 3 appetizers, only the salad came out, 20 minutes later the other 2 appetizers finally showed up, along with another salad. At this point we asked for the manager, who promised to get involved. Ordered another round of drinks, only one came out. After an hour the entrees finally started to arrive. Both orders of dim sum were cold, the shrimp sushi was crusted & with heads, the chicken teriyaki had the consistency & taste of rubber. Between the dismal service & mediocre food, it was one of the worst meals I have ever (attempted) to eat. The only positive was the manager taking a few items off the bill.",

Also bumped a little more because Reggie our server was awesome,  really nice guy, hooked us up with great service.  I would have been disappointed had we had to pay full price but at half off this is similar to a buy one roll get one free place in plaza midwood.  Decent sushi here, nothing special.  Sushi guru is my top sushi spot in town and this did not live up.  This place reminds me quite a bit of Baku near south park mall.  Prices would make you think the sushi is top notch here, the offering makes you question.  I would come back for half off time but never full price.",

They have half price sushi on Mondays and Wednesday's, which would be a great time to try this place since the sushi is a little pricey.",

    "text": "During my tenure in Charlotte, I only visited O-Ku once, but I have to say out of the limited choices for sushi restaurants in the Uptown area, it's probably your best bet.    The ambience here is definitely on the upbeat and trendy side - even on a Tuesday evening it was pretty bumpin'.  I was probably here for like 4 hours or something and never did I feel like the place was getting too quiet or anything like that.  I would recommend making a reservation since it seems like the place gets pretty crowded... actually, it could have been Restaurant Week, which would explain why it was so busy... but my memory fails me.  The decor is modern - place is dimly lit but not so dark that you can't see your food or your company.   Service was pretty good, if I recall correctly.  As for the food - we got an assortment of several different things ranging from spicy edamame, some appetizers, to an assortment of their finer sushi.  The spiced chili edamame was a good concept, but the sauce was a bit strange and I think I prefer the normal salted kind.  The yellowtail carpaccio was nicely marinated - I always enjoy a crudo/fish carpaccio as an appetizer.  We also had the five-spiced pork belly - this left a bit to be desired as well.  I prefer my pork belly melt-in-your-mouth style and this was on the chewier side.  We also tried one of their rolls as well as their sashimi - the fish is pretty decent, but it's by no means top grade sushi.  However, it's good enough to satisfy any sushi craving.  In short, probably your best option for sushi in Uptown Charlotte, nice service, and excellent ambience/atmosphere/vibe.",

I made plans to forgo the reservation route, and just go in right as the doors opened for the evening. I didn't quite get there when I anticipated, and I wasn't in the mood to wait, so my date and I had already chosen a backup in case we had to wait for a seat. Luckily, even with most of the chairs occupied, we were able to score a table right away.  The decor is lovely and it's a great setup to impress your date. I started off with a Lychee martini while looking over the sushi roll selection. Everyone says the potato roll is delicious, so we ordered that along with the Mermaid, and two others. All of the rolls were delicious. Typically I can decide which ones I would skip on my next visit, but they were all so good, I truly couldn't choose. I actually wish I had ordered a fifth roll.   O-Ku is a definite GO!",

Great low lighting and beautiful tree branches. We were sat at a small table right in the middle of the restaurant but it was still quite so I didn't mind.   Our server quickly greeted us (I'm feeling horrible that I'm struggling to remember her name but I think it was Jennifer). She gave us a full run down of the menu and her favorites. She even gave us a little sample of her favorite sake to try.   We ordered very slowly, one item at a time, to pace ourselves. We decided to start with the Yellowfin Carpaccio which was so delicate and was dancing all over our tongues. Second we ordered the Duck Buns and I will tell you right now I have a major obsession with Bao buns so these were heaven!   Our server did a great job on coursing out and giving us time to enjoy and relax without feeling rushed. We then ordered one roll, the Spider roll. This roll was also very delicious and was a great portion! The last thing we ordered was the $35 sashimi platter. The presentation was beautiful. Everything tasted so fresh and clean!   We told our server early on that we were celebrating my new job and when dessert came as a special treat for us we were honored that they treated us to a creme burlee. Perfect way to round out our evening!   Overall this restaurant shot straight up to top 5 favorite in Charlotte! I am looking forward to returning and trying some more items because EVERYTHING sounded so good and it was difficult to pick just a few things!! The service that was so personalized, refined and laid back was really what took this place to the next level!!   TRY IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT!!",

The menu is diverse and colorful, and you can tell that you're in store for more than just a plate of sushi.  The food lived up to expectations, but they were out of a few key menu items that I was really excited about.  Will definitely eat there again, happily.",

After a first unpleasant visit ( which we chalked up to Queens Feast), we thought we'd give it another try.  We went early (5:30), and even though there were only a handful of occupied tables, the hostesses hemmed and hawed for over 5 minutes before telling us they could not offer us a table due to reservations scheduled at 6:15 and 6:30.  When we promised we wouldn't linger, they gave us a table.  We ordered right away, then waited about 35 minutes before our food started to come out.  No wonder they were worried about seating us! Our waiter never came back to check on us, and when it was time to pay, he left the check on the table (even though I was holding out my card), and then came back a long while later. The whole visit felt slow and unfriendly. Shame on me for giving O-Ku another try.",

We were probably one of the only 3 tables there and about the last to leave. Our waiters couldn't be bothered with working and we had to literally get out of our seat to look for our server every time we needed something (water, drinks we ordered 45 mins prior, and mix ups on small plates) I wanna say the main thing that drove me to write this review was prior to the event we  prepared and set up a small cake with a candle to be brought out to the table and the server rushed it out with no candles, no happy birthday and one spoon (lol) --- Charlotte needs less \"trying\" in ambiance and more service! I run into this issue anytime I wanna try a new place out in the city.  --- won't be back..",

    "text": "Since Enso closed, was looking for a new spot in town to satisfy my pallete for sushi. Went with a group for dinner as Oku was disappointing both in food and service. The food we ordered as a group took FOREVER to make, I'm talking well over an hour. We came after 8pm so its not like it was a super busy point in the evening like 6pm is. Some of us ordered appetizers and that didn't even help lessen the irritation of getting our food served in a timely manner. If this was a place that truly cooks food fine, it take time to heat up things but this is a sushi spot and most of us ordered raw items. It could be understandable if the restaurant waited to have all the food brought to everyone at once but even that took too long. Finally, I had to have my food remade and I was even charged for something I didn't order but someone else at the table did. Multiple Mishaps absolutely deserves a negative review as I spent almost $50 on an evening that was memorable for the wrong reasons not the right ones. I definitely have to discourage people from considering here as I would have liked to know all this myself before going.",

    "text": "Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. We started off at the bar while we waited for the tables to be set up. He did make a reservation ahead since the size of the party was more then 10 people. The service at the bar was quick and easy to order. Their drink list was impressive and there sake list seemed good too. When they were ready to seat us, we were seated in this ackward L shape. On top of that some of our guest couldn't even sit with the main part of the table. They were given a little cocktail table for 4 people. I understand it was a big party, but the reservation was made a head of time, so i don't understand why the seating was not planned out better. While the front of the table received service, the back of the table waited about 20 mins before anyone took our drink order. When my boyfriend asked if we could put a drink order in, we were told by the waitress \"not yet, I'm still counting seats\". I've worked in the restaurant industry before and wouldn't tell a customer I'm still counting seats. But, cutting her some slack, she may have been new. Anyways by the time we got our drinks the other half of the party already got there main entrees. We didn't even put ours in yet. The sushi was good and we did get a cold sake which was also fine. I live close by, so I will be back and hoping for a better experience.",

Menu selection:  I had the Avocado Wrapped Roll with tropical fruit salsa ($10.50 = truly tasty!  I would order again and again, each visit.  Seawood salad ($6) had a slightly different flavor with a dressing that was very pleasant.  Sushi/sashimi combo included: 9 Maguro, 18 pieces of sashimi for $50.  Excellent selection and flavor.  Presentation was appealing.   Service:  Allison was attentive, knew the menu well and was able to suggest items for me (vegetarian) and my comrades (carnivores).  The manager Kristen stopped by table too to ensure everything was great.   Excellent.   Atmosphere and interior design: very intentional.  Lighting is soft with an Edison Bulb-esque lights and modern fixtures.  Raised tables and standard height tables add to create a visually  interesting dining room.  Music -love it!  Upbeat-mood tunes at a volume that allows to both hear/ennui the beat while still hearing the conversations at your table.   Great for: date, friend-time, business meal, celebration, even \"to go\".    Love! Love! Love!   My new favorite restaurant in Charlotte and I visit the city frequently for business.",

The Salmon Lemon Roll tastes like a Harris Teeter to go California Roll with salmon and lemon on top. The salmon in general was good quality, but was served warm. Right after eating at O-Ku, I went to a cheaper sushi place just to fulfill my appetite for larger portions at a better price. The hip atmosphere with its exposed brick and high tables could not compensate for my poor experience. Very disappointed since Charlotte Agenda highly recommend it.",

When we walked in my initial thoughts were, this place is sexy AND it is WAY too loud in here to be half full.   The hostess repeatedly asked us a ton of questions because she could barely hear us despite the fact that we were standing directly in front of her. They asked a TON of questions before seating us, including our phone number. Not sure why they needed all the info as we didn't have a reservation and didn't need to wait for a table.   Our server was excellent. Her name is Linda. We found out at the end of the night that she was in training, but she did a great job.   We had two sushi rolls: the mermaid roll and the kiwi-kani roll. The kiwi roll was fantastic. It was full of blue crab, tightly rolled, and had a sweet and salty balance I love.   We also had the curry duck. We were expecting a Thai type of entree with a large amount of sauce. Instead, it was a sliced breast with a curry marinade and some awesome eggplant. Recommend.   TL; DR: get the kiwi roll. Sit in Linda's section. Enjoy if you can hear your table mates.",

It takes another 30-40 minutes for our second course to arrive. Again, this course is 2-3 bites each. 20 minutes after that, our final course arrives. I got the waygu beef and felt that the overall quality of this dish was something I could have easily prepared for myself at home. The restaurant gave us 2 free appetizers but never apologized for the excessive wait. We paid $200 between the four of us there and left feeling hungry and dissatisfied. As I am now 0-2 in O-Ku experiences, I can not say that I will be visiting again.",

Everyone always has an off day and I want to thank the business for making things right. The way we were treated by management has earned our return business. Definitely the freshest Sushi in Charlotte for even the pickiest of sushi eaters.",

Things are under seasoned or just missing something. For drinks I did like the Tea-quilla but most others were too sweet. Lobster Temaki. First of all why anyone serves a a dish with 3 pieces is beyond me. How do I split that evenly with my friend!? (but that's just a personal irritatation) it's mostly rice, you can't taste the lobster which kind of defeats the purpose. The potato roll was pretty good, but poorly executed. The potato (exterior) was a little over fried, rice was mushy. Seemed like a cool idea. We had a few other dishes too but you get the idea. I was hoping for at least one \"oh, wow, how did they do that?\" moment for the price point, but it just didn't deliver. Honestly all of the issues come down to the rice being too mushy and things being underseasoned. The fish seemed fine but without the rice being right everything just ends up bleh.",

    "text": "Amazing sushi and wonderful service! I highly recommend you make a reservation tho - I came here with a friend on a Tuesday and there was a 30 minutes wait. I was running a little late so my friend received a complimentary yellow tail carpacio from the manager. We ordered the Bourbon tea and lychee martini and they were delicious but not too strong. I had the sushi sashimi platter ($35 version) and my friend had the tempura roll and sauteed veggies. I was quite impressed with the quality of the fish. They are up to par with other Michelin star sushi restaurants but you don't break the bank here (MF sushi in Houston comes to mind)! While we waited for our food, the waiter dropped a couple of appetizers: the shumai and dumplings combo and their version of bang bang shrimp - all complimentary of the house! I'm typically not a fan of bang bang shrimp because of the batter and the small shrimp inside of the batter but their version was big and so fresh and not overcoated with batter - I'd actually recommend this app and will get it next time! My sushi sashimi combo: I asked the waiter to serve only fish on my plate (take away any sweet tamago, fish ore, steamed shrimp and all the nonsense) and he delivered without charging me a dime extra! There was a crab stick sushi that I thought I'd dislike but it was so tasty since the crab was REAL snow crab (yum!) The atmosphere is a great fine dining, perfect for a nice date and for important business outing. Based on the quality of the food, the cost, the service and the ambiance, this place easily earns a 5 star!",

And the tuna wrapped tuna roll was also delicious.  I also recommend the spicy edemame - some of the best I've had!  Ambiance is great, with a great vibe in a low light dining area.

Around town, I stick to the sushi places I know and love, which are usually owned by the same people. But O-Ku's Monday and Wednesday half off specialty sushi rolls special, and their fresh seafood and tasty creations have made this spot my new go-to!  The ambiance is pretty, dimly lit, and a little romantic, so it's a good date spot or happy-hour spot with friends. Parking can get tricky so it's good to come here before peak eating times.  When it comes to the sushi menu: for crunch and savoriness I go with the Potato Roll -- who wouldn't love their sushi wrapped in thinly sliced fried potato, honestly? For a fresh, crisp taste on the palate I go with the Red Dragon. But with my experience here it seems you really can't go wrong!  I'm a wine drinker, so they've got a handful of wines by the glass for me to drink with my sushi. They also have by the bottle, beers, and signature cocktails.   They have other food besides sushi but I come here for the sushi!   Have a food allergy? They're super accommodating!  Even when the sushi isn't half price it runs about the same price as it's more reasonably priced competitors (unlike Nikko). It's hard to find a sushi place that has rolls outside of California and Phillys on half special. Thank you, O-Ku, for bringing creative, fresh sushi to this city at a reasonable price!",

Lychee Matinee - good balance of tart and sweet, with actual lychee garnish  First course... Yellowtail carpaccio - robust, spicy, dynamic *my favorite of the two* White Fish Crudo - very mild, light lemon flavor with olive oil  Second course... Wagyu Fritters (croquettes) - not appealing at all. Sent back and switched for shrimp Poke Bowl - mostly squid which was chewy (and actually tasted more like a mussel or other bivalve), not a lot of tuna, seaweed salad was good, bit of mango got completely lost in the mix. South End Shrimp - *favorite of this course* Delicious flavor, just spicy enough, perfectly cooked shrimp, and peanuts added great texture.  Third Course... (We both got the two sushi rolls option) Rainbow Roll - solid roll, but nothing special Tuna Wrapped Roll - good flavor contrast with the cucumber Red Dragon Roll - good flavor, good heat, good amount of crunch *my favorite* Spider Roll - spicy, a bit of crunch, very different from traditional spider rolls we've had in the past.  Unfortunately our second course came out at the same time as our sushi, so our tiny 2-person table was pretty crowded. Service was friendly, but the restaurant was very cold. (Most patrons, including us, had their coats on the entire time.)  All in all, our meal was good, but I wouldn't call it great. Nothing wow-ed us to a point where we would come back (especially for these prices!) since it's pretty out of the way for us. But if friends wanted to come here, I wouldn't mind coming back. For our part, the appetizers are really where they shine.",

So at our table I ordered whatever the waitress recommended and it turned out to be Hakushu on the rocks which is $28 so I kinda flipped my wig when I saw it on the bill.  Anything over $8 or $10 for a drink should come with a verbal confirmation of the price.  It tastes like Jack Daniels mixed with Teachers Highland Cream which is ok but not great.  I always forget Japanese whiskey tastes like bourbon.  But regardless it was a weak pour and the ice was melted by the time it got to the table.  Traditional edamame is the only way to go. Anything else is sacreligious. House salads are huge! Definitely share.  The crudo is a little heavy on the line juice but still good. Great finish.  Dim Sum appetizer is Japanese gyoza and shumai. Tye shumainis the clear winner. Tasty and lots of character. We kep the sauces for whatever came next they were so good.    The hot n heavy roll is really good!  Nigiri are a little sad and should be enjoy d before you tackle everything piled on the exotic roles.   Unisex bathrooms, two and still a line because they are individual use of course.",

    "text": "Beast mode sushi. So, this is my second time here. This time my wife and I shared the Spicy Rainbow roll, the hot and heavy roll, the red dragon roll and the potato roll. Though the hot and heavy was my favorite (and my wife's favorite) everything we had was great. Also, each roll tasted different. I love sushi, but two drawbacks to sushi can be 1 one roll is usually not enough to fill me, so I end up breaking the bank getting multiple rolls just for me and 2. Some places have rolls that all mostly taste the same. However, each sushi roll was distinct and delicious.  They have a Monday and Wednesday happy hour with half off sushi. Which is a great deal. One caveat is that the hot and heavy (the best one) is still full price.  Last time we came we tried several things, including the Lobster Temaki, the Yellow tail carpaccio, and the tartare.  Nothing disappointed. The atmosphere is cool and trendy.  Our server this time was a little slow, but overall, this is strong choice for sushi. The ambiance makes O-Ku a great place to impress a date.",

I ended up at Tibor Creek with the staff for last call LOL! Again the food and service at the bar was excellent. Chelsea my bartender was top notch. My girlfriends ordered like there was no tomorrow, mean while I decided to only get a few appetizers. Their food came out nice and quick, noticed that my appetizers would take a bit longer - Chelsea offered me a free drink, talk about great customer service! 30 minutes later my appetizers came out at a lower than expected standard- the GM Apollo - with the Born in America tattoo took it upon himself to ask the wonderful kitchen staff as they were shutting down to promptly redo the order - with no haste the food came out at a 5 Star  quality- I always get the fresh wasabi here too so it was even that much better. Want to thank and extend my gratitude to the management and staff for such a great experience! I don't know why I don't come here more often, but I will now ! Thanks Apollo for going above and beyond the call of duty ! My friend CJ appreciates the bday bottle, made her night",

I do understand the vibe they are going for with the  very low lighting but it was a much in my opinion.   The sushi was all delicious and the rolls were large.  I would recommend the spicy tuna roll. The prices are higher than most sushi spots in Charlotte but you are in a classy atmosphere and receiving superior service. They do have half off rolls on Monday and Wednesday if ordered during happy hour.   It gets quite crowded so I would recommend getting a reservation. The parking lot is small and a  pain to get in and out of. They do offer valet parking.",

It's best to make a reservation as the dining is limited, however, they do have a community table but it's really wide so it's difficult to have a date night there- but great for a group of friends. Luckily we were able to grab seats near the sushi bar which was a lot quieter. The manager walking around, blonde/tall female, was very personable and on top of things. There was a lot of teamwork which made everything run smoothly. The entire place is decorated amazingly. Tall ceilings, modern decor, low lighting.   The chili edame were by far the best I've had.

I made a reservation on OpenTable for a Friday night, 6:30 so I didn't have to wait in the line that was sure to be formed by then and off we go.  I got the obligatory reminder call on Friday afternoon by a pleasant lady which is always a nice touch.  We showed up and they had free valet parking which is a nice touch since nothing is worse than parking your own car and having to find a spot at a hot, new restaurant where everyone else is.  Walked in to a nicely decorated, well thought out space.  So dark I had to use my cell flashlight for the menu.  Nice music playing and servers were plentiful.  We got a nice hightop near the front door which was a nice table to start but as the restaurants filled up the overflow from the bar with people waiting for seats got a bit annoying as I really could care less about the guy this lady picked up on Tinder but was forced to listen to because she stood right near my table.  Our server was nice, attentive and was good at what he did.  I'm not a drinker so I usually order Iced Tea and come to find out they don't have Iced Tea on the menu.  WTF?  This is an outrage, all \"sushi places\" have Iced Tea.  Besides, this place originated in Charleston SC, the birthplace of Iced Tea and they're in the south for crying out loud.  This must change, now.  Anyway, I sipped on Charlotte's finest tap water instead.    Appetizer was the O-Ku Spring Roll which I highly recommend.  Nice selection of fish, some wonton crisps for added crunch and an outstanding sesame sauce for dipping.  Well done!  I grade a sushi place by the innovative specialty rolls and frankly O-Ku needs to beef it up, they only have about dozen on the menu and not too many standouts.  We had a Rainbow, Kiwi Kani, and Mermaid.  The Kiwi Kani fit the bill of innovative, and was delicious, the addition of the fresh kiwi made the roll and it was wonderful.  Dare I say one of the best rolls in the Queen City.  I noticed on the menu that they had fresh wasabi, not the green dyed horseradish that most have.  Come to find out they were out.  Here we go again, no Tea and no fresh wasabi?  Our Server suggested the pickled wasabi instead which was different and I must say, excellent.  Added a different dimension to the meal.  We finished with an almond cake or something and it was a nice cap to the meal.  I liked O-Ku.  They're still new but if you're looking for a new \"See and be seen\" place this is it.  Nicely done place with good food.",

Started with sashimi chef choice. First problem was that it was certainly the fish that had some age on it. Didn't taste fresh.  Second issue is that if I had independently ordered what was brought, it would have been less. No value in chef's poor choice.  Wife ordered the chicken teriyaki, which was dry and overcooked.  The texture reminded me of Tyson's precooked chicken.    The flounder sashimi was good so they get a second star. They charge a premium price but deliver a basic cut of fish.",

I was here with a couple friends one Saturday night, and the place was packed. Loud and lively, it's a great spot for a big group on a weekend. We started off with some drinks, and while I can't remember what everyone at our table ordered, I do remember that no one loved their cocktail. I'd recommend sticking with sake, beer or wine! The food presentation was lovely... nothing out of the ordinary though - flavor wise. The service was slow that evening, but in general the staff seemed very nice and courteous.

It's super clean and the bar service was excellent and friendly as we awaited our OpenTable reservation to be seated.  I think O-Ku would warrant 5 stars but the service was quite slow.  Table service was nearly full but tables seemed to turn at a reasonable rate.  We placed an order for 2 rolls and the Yellowtail app, knowing we'll order more as that arrives.  We then opted to put in our 2nd and 3rd order after waiting 45 minutes.  Our first course didn't arrive until 70 minutes into our seating.  Back to the food though!  The yellowtail was incredible.  It's plated with a sliver of Serrano Pepper but it wasn't overly hot.  Excellent balance with the heat and the other flavors.  We also had the Firecracker and Black Dragon rolls.  Both were phenomenal.  If you haven't given this new spot a shot, nows the time.  The newness has died down and you won't find better sushi within a decent radius.",

The dim sum disappeared but I was the only one that liked the tartare.  The other two I went with didn't like the consistency.  We all got sushi for dinner.  The green eggs and hamachi sushi is very flavorful but word to the wise - it has asparagus in it so if u don't like asparagus, might wanna avoid it.  We sat at the bar and the service was decent until around 8:15 when they started getting super busy.  Basically there was a second line of people around the bar and understandably the two bartenders had trouble keeping up.    All in all, great experience but the reason I gave it a four is because of the price.  I definitely think this place has great food and decent service but I'm not sure the cost is justified.  You're definitely paying for the atmosphere here (and maybe the cocktails) because I would certainly make the argument that ru sans down the street has sushi that's arguably just as flavorful (and many, many more sushi options) for half the price.  So if you're not interested in a date night or trying to impress someone at a hip new restaurant, I'd go there.",

The appetizer edamame in truffle oil was fantastic. We also ordered the dumpling dim sum which was suggested by our knowledgeable waiter, Tony and it was an excellent choice . I ordered the chicken teriyaki with fried rice. I have to say it is the best fried rice ever! All others at the table ordered sushi and it looked and tasted amazing. We will definitely be back our next time in Charlotte.",

The manager himself, Robert, came over to personally wish us a happy anniversary. Everything we ordered was amazing and the ambiance is great for date night/get togethers with friends.

This place isn't so fancy where I felt out of place, but the service made it feel really fancy. The server brought a tray of additives (like lemons, limes, cucumbers) to put in the water.  We got the bao, wagyu sashimi, and otoro sashimi, and a few rolls. I'm going to roll past the rolls - they were honestly surprisingly common and mediocre...  But I didn't care because the sashimi they put together was just unreal. I could seriously eat a few dozen pieces of their sashimi. It was high quality fish, and exceptional pairing of flavors. The most delicate of umashi or lemon flavors in the most perfect of bites.  I'm so hungry thinking about it. Do it. Now.",

With a party more than two I would recommend reservations because this place was slammed.  Service was slower than I think it should have been but the staff was attentive and very cordial.  We ordered an array of dishes ranging from edamame with chili sauce and tofu for apps to blue crab carpaccio and sushi sampler for two as entrees.  All of it tasted fresh and was beautifully presented.  The tofu stuck out in my mind as probably the best I've had however, that's not at a discount of the fillets of fish served with the sushi sampler.",

I'm 100% certain we would not have been seated otherwise as this place has obviously earned a well-deserved reputation with Charlotte foodies!  They were packed and the parking lot was no different... fear not, though, they had a wonderful young man working valet outside.  He was getting it done, somehow!!  We were seated quickly, and I started with the Bourbon Berry Basil Lemonade... it was so good, I ordered it twice (because why drink one when you could drink two for double the price?!)!    Given that it was 1/2 price sushi night, we ordered rolls for days... Salmon & Lemon, Mermaid, Red Dragon, Hot & Heavy, Potato, and Rainbow rolls were all phenomenal... The Salmon Nigiri (with truffle chive creme fraiche and lemon zest) is to die for... the South End Shrimp and Dumpling Dim Sum are heaven... and, if you have space in your belly, please please please try the edamame with truffle oil... I'm not sure how anyone can eat a meal here and not roll out feeling like they need new pants... The sushi was perfection, fresh, and well worth the price...   I cannot wait to come back and spoil myself here... so happy that my girls spoiled me too!  MUCH love for O-Ku Charlotte!",

It was my first time trying it and can definitely say that I am not uni person. I highly recommend the spicy rainbow, salmon lemon, and dragon rolls. I was happy with the 50% off price, but on any other day the rolls seem overpriced.",

As a vegetarian, I was super nervous that there wouldn't be any veggie options (based on the online menu), but as soon as we were seated, our waitress told us they were able to substitute some rolls for veggies and that there were also appetizers that were veggie-friendly. Before we ordered, our waitress poured our waters. And then another lady came around with a tray full of fruit/veggie slices and asked which we would like in our waters. Whoa. I LOVED THAT!  So, my bf and I ordered the 'South End Tofu' for apps. I ordered the Potato Roll (minus all the meat) with cucumbers as the substitute (already came with avocado, fried sweet potato, and carrot). My boyfriend ordered the Potato Roll as is (with the meat). The South End Tofu was the BOMB . COM!!!! So so so so so delicious. And my potato roll was equally delicious. My mouth is watering at the thought of it. I would 100% recommend, and I would also love to come back!",

All of the dishes were delicious and the quality of food that came out matched the ambience. My only complaint would be that the menu online for restaurant week did not match the menu at the restaurant. Specifically the wagyu tartare was said to have a quail egg on top online. This was not the case in the restaurant. As small of a thing as this may seem, I was really looking for that addition to the great dish. I feel as though this would be a good place to do an Omakase, however, if you are more of a sushi roll person, their rolls lacked a uniqueness I look for.",

    "text": "After living in the DC area for the better part of a decade I grew used having *really* good sushi. Moving to Charlotte, my girlfriend and I were disappointed with what we found. Somehow we managed to overlook O-Ku for over a year before visiting -- but after the first time there, we've become loyal O-Ku patrons and have stopped our search for good sushi. O-Ku holds the distinction for both of us as being the best sushi we've had, period -- not just in Charlotte, but in far larger and more culinarily competitive cities as well.   The ambiance at O-Ku is spectacular, very hip feeling and always packed even in the middle of the week. The drinks are great and are the product of a very passionate mixologist. The food -- sushi and hot food -- is all great as well. Mondays and Wednesdays 5-7 are happy hour, 50% off of most rolls. Outside of happy hour the menu can feel a bit pricy, but the quality of the rolls is bar-none best in Charlotte. We're big fans of the Spicy Rainbow Roll, the Salmon and Lemon roll, and the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll. Outside of sushi, we're big fans of the curry udon and uni pasta as well -- we both initially started off heavily disliking the uni(sea urchin), but have come around on it thanks to how skillfully it is prepared at O-Ku.   The True highlight of O-Ku, though, is the omakase -- the chef's choice. For $125 you get a 6-7 course meal made up of several sushi/seafood based dishes, followed by a hot dish, miso soup, and a dessert. This has become our go-to for big celebrations -- birthdays, our anniversary, Valentine's day, etc. In the past year we've done the omakase four times, and if money wasn't an issue we'd probably do it at least once a month. The most creative thing we've had during omakase was a sort of weird take on nachos and dip with tempura fried seaweed sheets as the nachos and a base of salmon with uni, caviar and a piece of gold leaf as the \"dip\". Definitely weird in a good way, though -- we were a bit skeptical at first, especially since our taste for uni hadn't matured yet, but it was incredible and I wish it was on the regular menu.",

We were greeted immediately when we arrived and taken directly to our table.  After settling in we noticed that the lighting was a little strange.  It was that kind of \"at dusk\" light that never lets your eyes fully adjust.  Still, the decor and ambience is really nice and it is, overall, a very comfortable place.    Our waitress had a sort of casual, disinterested, attitude and wasn't extremely welcoming or helpful when we explained it was our first time.  I felt like she could have pointed out some highlights or something to let us know why O-Ku was different or better than going to our favorite sushi places, Rusans and Yama.    We ordered a couple starters.  The Tempura Oysters were awesome.  Crispy fried and deliciously plump oysters.  The Dumplings were, meh.  They were split into Shrimp and Pork with the shrimp ones being really tasty and the pork just so so.  Then our waitress surprised us with an order of Yellowtail Carpaccio!  She moved up several knotches with that move.  The Carpaccio was really good.  It wasn't a huge serviing but the fish was fresh and tasty.  We ordered two rolls, the Rainbow Roll, and the Dragon Roll.  Both were good but nothing outstanding or different than a number of other sushi joints.   I had a piece of Toro and it was so delicious but super expensive.    In the end, we decided that, while we would be back, O-Ku did not show us anything that was spectacular and out of the ordinary.",

The level of service is just as good as the food. This is the only sushi place I've eaten at in North Carolina that compares to Japan or NYC's top sushi restaurants.

    "text": "After a horrible initial experience, the manager contacted me to give them another chance.  I did not take any compensation or special treatment for a revisit, and I specifically told the manager that I wanted an organic experience.  We arrived to a not so crowded O-Ku and were promptly seated.  The waitress who brought over water to our table greeted us by the name on our reservation (nice touch).  We were happy to be there on one of the 12 Days Of Christmas deals, half off a bottle of wine!!  It was delish!  We ordered our food, and I was very clear that I did not want ANY fish eggs due to me being vegetarian.  This time, it was a success... no fish eggs.  However, the chef forgot to put avocado in my two ingredient roll (avocado and cucumber) so he apologized and remade the roll promptly.  The waitress took the roll off our ticket, even though we did not complain or ask for that to happen.  Great service!!  I was slightly disappointed that two out of two experiences resulted in food being incorrectly prepared, but the resolution of the issue by management was quickly mitigated to our delight and utmost satisfaction.  Service was exceptional this go around!!  I am glad to have given this a second chance, they did not let me down!",

The hostesses were extremely friendly and our waitress was even better.  The service was phenomenal.  The food was delicious.  We tried 5 of the specialty appetizers and our favorite was the yellowtail carpaccio.  They were all delicious and beautifully presented.  We also ordered 5 sushi rolls.  Our favorite was the spicy rainbow with soft-shell crab roll.  It was an exceptional evening and we will definitely go back again.",

I love the creative nature of the dishes and the space itself lends to a trendy crowd and a nightlife atmosphere for either your lounge needs or straight hungry self.  The waygu (sp) tartare was a great way to start my meal and followed up by the spider roll.  Of course spider rolls aren't exactly the most creative thing on the menu but was done excellently regardless.  Interiors are pleasing aesthetically and the staff was attentive and cheerful to say the least.  Be prepared to either valet (recommended) or park a bit of a distance away due to the layout and density of the parking lot and surrounding area.",

    "text": "After reading some reviews, I was bracing for another let down. I am happy to write that while the food did not blow us away, and the price tag was a little steep, I was very pleased with the service and the overall experience.   Friday night 6:45pm, the place was pretty hopping already. Scoring a RSVP at this place is like trying to get a golden ticket. My initial RSVP was 9pm, sort of late for dinner but my friend and I were fine. Then last minute on day of, some cancellations must have happened and we got ourselves an earlier time.   This isn't a big space. The entryway isn't grand. In fact it is very small, kind of hidden. Just look for Big Ben (the British pub) and it's next to it facing Tremont.   SETTING: Intimate, small with good use of high ceiling industrial space to make it feels less crowded but you are pretty close to other patrons. We were sat at a table right at the bathroom entry, not the greatest spot but for 2 people it was fine as we sat away from the walkway.  DRINKS: We had beer and liquor drinks all night, thus can't speak of their cocktails. I did see quite a few unfinished cocktail drinks at other tables... so maybe just stick with beer/liquor/sake.   FOOD: I had the miso soup ($4) - the seafood dashi did give it a little \"ocean\" taste so if you don't eat seafood, beware. We had the Wagyu Tartare ($16) - it was a little tough/chewy which I didn't expect. Good flavor but for the price and the tiny portion, not sure if I would order this again. For entree we shared the largest sashimi/nigiri combo ($100). Not sure if any 2 people need $100 worth of raw fish (lol). Great presentation. Lots of food yet we somehow managed to finish almost all of it. BEST were the salmon (Scottish & Ora King). Enjoyed the Uni. A little disappointed by the Otoro, but I am never much of a tuna fan.  SERVICE: Allison was really attentive. And when my friend got caught off guard by the black volcano salt and didn't quite enjoy the Otoro, she got the manager to bring us another 2 pieces without the salt for a 2nd chance tasting.   ONLY RANT: What's up with the 2 single use (unisex) bathrooms for the ENTIRE place? This is not about the nightmare of the bathroom law politics, this is about the practicality of not enough bathrooms for use. Be prepared to wait in line (both guy & gal), and to feel rushed while in the bathroom (because you can hear the complaining from the line across the wall).   OVERALL - good, definitely less disappointing than other new spots I have tried recently. Will revisit and try other things on the menu.",

When received the bill the $14 appetizer were were told as a gift was on the menu. This was disappointing. Would probably not go back due to slow and non attentive service for the expensive price. There are many great choices in Charlotte that I would prefer to try and spend my money and feel good about the experience. Update:  I appreciate the restaurant reaching out to me and apologizing and offering to correct any issue as they let me know my experience is not typical. Thank you.",

I wanted to love it but it wasn't the best and I love sushi. High rice little filling or meat for the price this is not acceptable. It was some of the most tasteless sushi I've had in a awhile. Half price on Monday's. I would come back for apps or drinks after work but wouldn't rush back for the sushi.",

Second, The ambiance is so nice, loud, and dark, it makes it comfy and a cute place for a date. I would just say, not a recommended child friendly restaurant; just because the place is tight and too loud and fast. Third, the host was nice and pointed us to the bar right away because the house was full, but the bar did not disappoint.  Fourth, menu is large and safe to say the mermaid roll was delicious, the seaweed salad was nice sized and yummy and the spicy edamame was addicting, the bar tender also hooked us up with some nice sushi, unfortunately I forgot what it was called. Last but not least, the service was great, my drink remained full and my seaweed salad took a while to come out and they paid for it while also giving us some great sushi to try. Mark the bartender was extremely helpful, sweet and I would come back just for him! 10/10!! So happy it's in the neighborhood.",

O-ku's sushi was unreal, so different and unique with such great tastes - really impressive. A little pricey, but you'll get what you pay for.   We also ordered an edamame appetizer - $5, which is super reasonable. However, when our server brought it out, there was only a tiny handful of edamame on the plate! It was truly laughable how small this serving was.   The glasses of wine were also overpriced, $11 being the cheapest glass you could order. We stuck with a draft beer for $7 - fairly good beer selection but definitely overpriced.   Our server was good - knew everything and anything about the menu, but needed you to know that. Almost went through every item on the menu and was a bit overbearing. Good service, didn't forget anything, just a bit abrasive.  We'll probably go back. Our server suggested (among many other things) that we try Wednesday nights because they're 1/2 off sushi, sounds great. We might just stick to carry-out though.",

Seriously...it was served on a teacup saucer sized plate.  That's fine, it's 3 courses.  About 45 minutes later we got the second course which was, again, 2 bites.  Finally, the entree came at 10:30 at night.  This was my first time here, so I'm not sure if this is the norm.  But wow, dinner for four people taking over 2 hours?  The food was okay.  The entree was plain white rice, undercooked red onions (yuck), and some steak which was a bit fatty but not bad.  Pretty disappointing for the price tag and we ate it while discussing where we should go get pizza afterwards.  We were mostly disappointed that a manager never came over, the server never asked how a single thing was, etc.  And the $90 bill for two people was painful.  We were so excited to try this place and it usually gets great reviews, but we won't be back.",

Favorite dishes: the lobster maki rolls--delicious! And a bit filling. Also loved the tuna cerviche & seaweed salad (I can't believe I've gone this long w/o trying seaweed salad. I am getting info that from now on).The mermaid roll was interesting, very tasty. The salmon sushi was very fresh, as was the octopus. For dessert-butterscotch pudding with caramel & black toasted sesame seeds. Not as heavy as it sounds--and super flavorful. O-ku is a special occasion restaurant!

She actually just got back from a two-week, cross-country road trip. Samantha, you are the bomb and I hope you take me with you on your road trip next time.  Anyway, we started with drinks because we were waiting on a member of our party to arrive. Samantha brought out complimentary edamame, which was good but a little too salty (my only complaint). She also brought out complimentary pork dumplings and a bite-sized shrimp dish since we had two first-timers in our party. The pork dumpling was delicious -- great flavor -- and I loved the ginger dipping sauce.  I ordered the tuna crunch roll and the avocado wrapped roll. The tuna crunch was awesome -- tender tuna with great flavor from the eel sauce. The roll didn't fall apart when I picked it up, which I appreciate. The avocado roll had vegetables wrapped in rice with a layer of avocado topped with fruit salsa and ginger. It was really unique and tasty.  Our experience was fabulous -- food, service, parking, atmosphere, and drinks were all amazing.   Also, I love their Monday and Wednesday half-price rolls from 5-7pm.   See ya soon, O-Ku!",

My date wanted some sake and Dragon god sounds like it would be pretty tasty, right?  Oh, it was.  A little fruity for my taste, but no complaints.  We also went ahead and ordered the salmon nigiri with creme fraise and truffle.  Beautiful flavors that worked well together.  Although something else with a little crunch to counterbalance the rice, salmon and cream might be more my thing.  Then the waygu carpaccio and the roast duck buns.  Both, spot on.  I mean, really good.  Buttery, fatty raw beef with a quail egg.  The buns were pretty much boa tacos.  Relatively new to me, but liking this trend.  The duck was cooked perfectly and the hoisin was perfect.  Lots of places in town I still need to try, but good to know I now have a go-to when near southend.",

Megan was our server and did a nice job from stem to stern--no complaints.  The manager also came by a couple times and talked which I enjoyed.  I asked about the restaurant group (Indigo Road out of Charleston) and future eateries opening from them soon.

Very impressed!  I usually don't like champagne- but the prosecco was very delightful!  My negative would be the VERY dim lighting. It was so hard to see the menu & the food. The beautiful presentation was lost in the darkness. Literally had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu.  Everyone was so pleasant- what a great experience !! Very busy place on a Tuesday night!  Free valet parking  And should it matter to you- they have 2 single use Unisex restrooms.  This would be an excellent date location.",

The dish is perfectly balanced with bitter (in a good way) Brussels sprouts, perfect buttery risotto, and mouth watering-spiced short rib. That dish is an A+  The mermaid roll, salmon and lemon roll, and spicy tuna rolls were pretty good too. Not amazing, but pretty good sushi.   The miso soup was perfect. Exactly what miso soup should taste like. A bit like shellfish, salty, but not too salty.   The environment/decor was cool too.   Cons: our water tasted funny- like bad tap water.   It's a bit pricey. Our total bill for two after a 15% tip was 77 dollars.   Overall, I would recommend for a special date night.",

However at non happy hour prices its a bit hard to swallow. Oh yeah, I said that.  If you dine in Mon, Wed. and Fri from 5-7 all their rolls are half price. We sat at the communal table and we very comfortable and the well looked after.  My first visit, we had quite a large group and even though we were ordering lots of food and drinks (all on one check) our server kept getting lost for long stretches of time. Could have been bad luck or some of those \"just open kinks.\"   O-Ku is a nice option if you are looking to dine early, mid-week.",

    "text": "Quite possibly the best sushi experience I have ever had! My fiancee had raved about O-Ku and their Monday/Wednesday half-off special, so we gathered a couple of friends and went. I had set up a reservation for 6:15pm. We showed up a little early and only had three of our party of four, but they kindly say us anyway.   Our server Samantha came out immediately with waters for the table and offered to wait for our fourth before taking drink orders. While we were waiting, Samantha brought us an order of edamame with pink himalayan salt and truffle oil. It was very good, but also very VERY salty. Samantha also brought us some pork dumplings and a kind of little shrimp cake since three of our four had never been to O-Ku before! Thanks Samantha, you're the best.  ON TO THE SUSHI! I had the Mermaid roll first. Scallop, salmon, and avocado with a spicy aioli and eel sauce. Fabulous, large portion and stayed intact betwixt my chopsticks! Second was the Spicy Dragon Roll - tempura shrimp, avocado, eel, eel sauce, and the spicy aioli again. Ri-donk-ulous. Samantha came around like clockwork checking on us to make sure everything was ok, which it was. She had just returned from a vacation and was getting back into the swing of things, so I appreciated her level of attentiveness!  O-Ku isn't the closest option, nor the cheapest, but definitely the best!",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  I have mixed feelings about O-Ku Sushi.  I think the hype is what ultimately led to a bit of a letdown on our part.    They are located in the Atherton Mill on the corner opposite Luna's Living Kitchen.  If you get there early enough, you can easily snag a parking space and avoid using the valet.    The inside is every bit as lovely as noted in the reviews - it's swanky and hip, with high ceilings and exposed duct work.  The lighting is dim, but sufficient for viewing the menus and still having the desired ambience.  They also play great music.    My husband and I visited early one Wednesday during their half price sushi night (available from 5-7pm).  That was a big bonus, since the sushi is a bit expensive for what you get.  We ordered four things (in order of our favorites) - Lobster Temaki hand roll, Potato Roll, Tuna Wrapped Roll, and Salmon Lemon Roll.  The latter three were covered under the sushi deal, but the Lobster Temaki wasn't, and was still worth every bit the $18 price tag.  Their signature roll, the Potato Roll, was crispy and delicious.  My husband preferred the Tuna Roll more than I did, since it seemed a bit salty to me.  The biggest disappointment, however was the Salmon Lemon Roll, since it was practically flavorless.  When I compare this to the similar roll from CO, there really is no comparison - CO's is hands down the best, with the added lemon aioli that elevates the dish.  We both had lychee martinis, and they were really (really!) good, and not too sweet.  Service was excellent as well.  Our server offered a few suggestions upon hearing we were first-timers, and was both friendly and efficient.  So is O-Ku the best sushi place in Charlotte?  I don't think so.  But we would absolutely return for three things - the phenomenal Lobster Temaki hand roll, the Potato Roll, and, of course, the Lychee Martinis!",

I finally planned in advance and headed there on Wednesday at 6:30pm.  We were told that there was still 30 minutes left on the 1/2 priced Sushi & Maki rolls.  You better believe we got our orders in real quick!  I ordered the Vegetable Tempura roll and the Avocado Wrapped roll.  I'm not a huge seafood person, so I always appreciate when sushi places put inventive veggie options on the menu.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The tempura roll actually just had lightly tempura veggies inside a regular roll, so it was tasty without being heavy.  The Avocado wrapped roll had beautiful, thinly sliced pieces of avocado laid on top, with some delicious mixed veggies inside.  In addition, we ordered the regular edamame...nothing special about this, but it was good.  Lastly, we finished off the meal with the chocolate bento box.  The warm chocolate cake was decent, but the green tea ice cream was quite tasty.  Overall, the decor was modern, food was great and we enjoyed our meals.  Service was a bit slow and the wine was OK.  I think next time, I may just come in with either a date or some friends, sit at the bar and order some food/drinks.  The cocktails look amazing!!!",

Thank you Kimmy!  They brought my friend free dessert for his birthday.   The sushi is good...maybe We didn't have all the right things... We had the yellowtail carpaccio topped w Serrano peppers, which i would recommend. The shrimp appetizer was delicious, similar to bang bang shrimp but lighter.

We went on a Thursday night and had reservations. Eventhough it was a weeknight, it was pretty packed so I would definitely recommend reservations. We shared several dishes and I can't even remember them all. That being said, my favorites were: LOBSTER TEMAKI, PASTA with CANDIED BACON, and SHORT RIB. There was also a raw salmon dish that was delicious!   The food was impeccable. The service was top-notch. The vibe inside was super cool (the wooden sinks in the bathroom were so unique).

This brick restaurant offers valet as well as a parking lot with some parking.  I'd recommend calling and making reservations before going since they are usually busy (especially on the weekends).  Once inside, you'll find your eyes darting back and forth from one light fixture to another.  There's scattered TVs too incase you are interested in watching a game.  The menu is simple- we had the spicy chili edamame as an appetizer (I enjoyed the spice).  For dinner we tried 3 different sushi rolls (the dragon roll, the spider roll, and the red dragon roll).  My favorite was the red dragon roll because I am a fan of tempura shrimp.  The music is quite loud in there so this restaurant suits an intimate hangout where you can just focus on speaking to one person rather than trying to follow multiple conversations.",

    "text": "I went to O-ku this past week for the first time with some friends. The food and drinks were fine. I ordered the Queen's Feast during restaurant week, and ate some delicious albeit small-plated dishes. However, what I will remember most clearly about my one (and assuredly, only) dining experience at this establishment is the smugness and condescension with which our group was treated by our server, Tim.  When Tim asked if I had any questions about the menu, I inquired as to the definition of \"maki\". Tim literally laughed in my face and said, \"No, but really, what's your real question?\" I've eaten plenty of sushi so far in my life, but have never come across this word before; clearly I am uncultured and foolish for asking such an idiotic question. Later, when ordering drinks, Tim asked my friend if she lived under a rock after admitting she hadn't tried a lot of basil-infused alcoholic products/beverages and wasn't certain if she enjoyed the taste. Shortly thereafter, the same friend asked if there was a Merlot available for order; aghast, Tim exhaled, \"ABSOLUTELY NOT!\", insinuated Merlot and any Merlot-drinkers were garbage, and advised her that she would undoubtedly enjoy a Cab (she does not like Cabernet Sauvignon but Tim insisted she just hadn't tasted the right one yet). I'm going to assume Tim was unhappy that three people out of the party of five ordered the buy-one-get-one-half-off rolls that O-ku offers on Wednesdays, as evidenced by him taking away the sharing plates in a huff while saying, \"You won't need these because no one is sharing.\" I have dined in restaurants much finer and more expensive and have never been treated with such rudeness and snobbery.  So thank you, Tim, for ensuring I will never return to O-ku. In the future, should I have a desire to feel belittled and ridiculed, I'll be sure to return and ask you to be my server. I think I've written maybe two other Yelp reviews, and I'm not usually one to complain about less-than-ideal service, but this experience left me feeling like garbage (and I don't even drink Merlot).",

As good as anything I experienced in midtown Manhattan. Well stocked bar. I settled for a glass of sake, the perfect accompaniment to the omakase, which was effectively a rainbow tour of form and fish offered by O-ku. BTW, the name means \"oak,\" which could use some explanation for its nexus to fish or chef. I plan to return on the nights that feature half off nigiri between 5 and 7pm.",

Dim Sum App- came with 4 small pieces of shu mai and 4 dumplings. So delicious but definitely not comparable to authentic dim sum.   Hot n Tasty Roll- decent size, flavors worked well together and was good  Salmon and Lemon Roll- chose this one due to the uniqueness and it did not disappoint! Probably my favorite dish of the night  Sashimi- we got both maguro and hamachi. Both were really good and fresh. Slices were a little bit on the thinner side than what I'm used to in other cities.   Overall, pretty good food, service was attentive, and I'd recommend to anyone visiting Charlotte!",

My water glass was always full, the recommendations were helpful, and the food came out promptly. Given the fun clubby music and dim lighting, this would be a fun place to head with a group of friends.  The tuna belly sashimi melted in my mouth and had a nice kick from the wasabi layered between the fish and rice, the lobster temaki were very filling and contained some tasty aioli that brought all the ingredients together nicely (no soy sauce necessary!) and the yellowtail carpaccio was thinly sliced and seasoned perfectly with a mango cube on top that perfectly complimented the dish.   I'd like to return and try more of their cooked options (raw fish is a little hit or miss for me). Overall a tasty spot!",

After a bit of searching, I fell upon this place with a fellow yelp elite and we decided to give it a run and since then, i have showed up multiple times post that initial visit. The place is very trendy and has a very open atmosphere with high ceilings. The decor is beautiful and the restaurant has always been packed every time I have shown up to this joint. The spots will fill up quick so make sure to make your reservation in advance. The servers/waiting staff/bartenders are all super friendly and very accommodating. Every time that I have been here, I have been seated quickly and with our servers not too far behind us.   The joint itself has a solid menu and just keep in mind that this is a primarily \"roll\" oriented menu which they do well. I personally don't eat a lot of rolls as I am not big on the sauce but even I could give it a solid nod for the combinations they came up with. The fish is fresh although I wont say it's the freshest so the rolls will definitely be the way to go. The fish is good quality although you can tell that some of them have been frozen. Even with that everything is definitely solid and probably the best sushi spot I have had the opportunity to visit while being in charlotte thus far. I will say the service is top notch here which just adds a nice kick up to the experience. They have always been cordial and even saved my life by protecting my wallet one time with no missing items so god bless these guys.  A solid joint and definitely \"THE\" spot to visit in Charlotte if you are looking for sushi and a nice atmosphere for dinner.",

With this, it becomes a cheap sushi bonanza like those dirty revolving sushi places any experienced US sushi-eater has gotten sick at but continues to visit. You will need (not want, NEED) a reservation though, because if you show up at 4:30 they'll tell you about the 2.5 hour wait. I'll let you do the math. Lol",

My experience was started off by Zoey (I apologize if this is spelled incorrectly) who greeted me with a huge smile and a genuine attitude. As anyone that eats out often can tell you, that is not a common thing to see from the hostess!  As she was a phenomenal way to start my experience, I also had the pleasure of having Alex as my server. If you like smiles, laughs, and a friendly personality then you will love Alex. She gave me space while still maintaining a connection. The food was fantastic. Sushi is honestly the best I've had in Charlotte and is definitely fairly priced  for the quality of it. The yellow tail carpaccio and the King Salmon Usuzukuri were both great light options to get the taste buds going before  settling into my meal. Both had a slight kick to them which was enjoyable. I ordered the mermaid roll and the eel dragon roll as my entrees and they were fantastic as well. Justin the GM checked on me and made sure that everything was great and was certainly a pleasure to talk with as well. Overall, this was not my first time at O-KU and it will not be my last. As any foodie will understand, this will certainly be in my rotation! Thanks O-KU.",

Tuna tartare was equally as small and did not come with enough chips. Both these dishes cost you around 12-15 dollars. Sushi was okay, probably the only menu item worth getting. Do not bother with the negri, it too was bite sized and over priced. The whole experience took about 2 hrs and we did not get any cooked food.",

The half off sushi Mon + Wed 5-7! Amazing! Because of the great sushi and great value, me and the girls go to sushi every 2-3 weeks here and look forward to it so much. We make a reservation because there are usually at least 5 of us. LOVE YOU OKU!!!! Stay awesome!! PS, the dragon roll is probably my favorite with the mermaid a close 2nd(I typically don't like raw sushi but the mermaid has a great balance of crunch so the texture of the raw doesn't freak me out).  I love that they don't overly batter/fry this roll. It's very lightly fried so it's just enough crunch! Perfect! The potato roll is really good but the potato taste is a bit overpowering for sushi so I'd split this with someone if I got it again. A few pieces of this one is enough for me. This is a good roll for someone that doesn't typically like sushi. The cali is nice and fresh! And the Spring Roll appetizer is very good too! Also, the Shogun cocktail is really good. It has basil! Sounds weird but it's really good! Go try them out!!! Fab spot.",

My sashimi platter took an hour and a half to arrive to the table (they did give me a glass of wine for the wait), but what bothered me is that they tried telling me that sashimi takes longer to make than regular rolls. That is insanity - sashimi is literally cut up fish- and I frequent the best sushi places in the US (nobu, morimoto, sushi samba, sugarfish, katsuya) and this has never happen! They were aware of issues but only the waitress apologized. I never saw the manager and we have several issues during our meal.

You will not be disappointed with the quality of sushi. We had the spider roll, rainbow roll and tuna roll. For an app we had the ceviche tacos (please note these tacos are miniature size but very delicious). I also had the bourbon basil strawberry drink ( can't remember the name exactly) and it was delicious -- not too sweet, not too tart. And although this restaurant is very new and was very crowded for a Saturday night, the service was on point. We sat at the bar ( hour wait for a table) and all of the bartenders were super friendly and provided exemplary service. The hostess stand was equally friendly and as we were leaving they went out of their way to thank us for coming and say good bye.",

By my second visit, we knew to go ahead and place a second drink order as soon as the first one arrived because of the time lag. Unfortunately, you rarely see your own waiter or waitress except for when they take your initial order, after that it's a bevy of food runners none of whom care if you need anything else or didn't like something, leaving you feeling abandoned after the you've gotten your food items. I just wish they would either hire more staff or just do a better job on reservations/seating tables so that people that are spending hundreds of dollars on a single meal feel like they're not being neglected.",

Me and  two if my good friend came in for Happy Hour last night.  It started out with my reservation not being in the system.  I called a week and a half in advance and chatted with the hostess about how excited I was to try Oku Charlotte.  However, the hostess was great and although it was busy she found us a great table.  We ordered 5 or 6 rolls all of which were delicious as Oku always is.  We were prepared to stay a while and have a second bottle of wine.  Three servers shows up and started clearing our plates before we were even finished.  We articulated that we were not done and they brought us new plates but it was a bit awkward and we felt as though we were being rushed out.  I have been going to Oku in Charleston for a long time and I never felt rushed or unwelcome even when it was happy hour.  That feeling of being welcomed is the main thing that kept me coming back time after time.  I will give Oku Charlotte one more try, but I thought it important to share my experience.  I want to love it as much as I do in Charleston.",

When one opens, Charlotteans rush to it and those restaurants and bars are overcrowded and unprepared for dealing with such large crowds. Two months later, these same places will, if well managed, still be in business. For example, Babalu started out packed, and now it's parking lot is pretty empty even on weekends. If Charlotteans want to sustain good restaurants, they have to continue to support them, not just rush off to the next new place. Today's case on point is Charlotte's newest and probably largest sushi restaurant, O-Ku. Is the food good? Absolutely. Is it worth the value? Absolutely not. O-Ku has Nobu prices but not Nobu quality. Service is decent given the overcrowded environment, but the restaurant is too noisy, food production and delivery spotty, and the ambiance more of a club than a fine dining establishment. O-Ku is just OK.",

We loved it so much we went two nights in a row. The service, food and wine are all phenomenal. Definitely the best sushi (and many other things) in Charlotte!! You must go, but please leave room for us at the bar :)",
