A plain design helps cultivate negative feelings, but in my experience the smaller the place, the better the food.   I walked in out of the rain and greeted by a warm, polite staff. We moved awkwardly, like a missed high five, to my seat. I sat there with the short menu for a moment, skeptically eyeing the make your own pho with 6! options maybe a 7th who knows. After only a brief moment my waitress asked if I were ready to order and I quickly decided on the make-your-own with 3 different meats for 7.99 which is a price im used to seeing. I chose the well brisket, well beef, and rare beef accompanied by a pot of jasmine tea. Only 5mins went by until I was brought my pho and condiments including a moderate amount of bean sprouts, a sprig of mint, four jalapenos, and one lime. I squeezed the lime over the bowl and laid the side pieces into the soup with care, the a dash of salt and pepper, followed by a light zigzag line of hoisin over the bowl and finally another pattern this time of sriracha sauce. Eventually I finished the soup and drank every bit of the delicious broth, with occasional sips from my tea cup. Overall I recommend trying this little spot. They have bubble tea and other menu items worth trying. My visit was exceptional. I plan on trying this place again someday",

My wife and I have been there probably 20 times and there is never more than 3 or 4 tables filled, yet it takes 10 to 15 minutes for them to take our order, regardless if we seat ourselves or not. THEN it takes another 15 to 20 minutes to actually get the food. I have seen many people served before us although they arrived after, but they were Asian, so maybe they are just racist. I hate it, because the pho is so good, but we have had enough and will never be going back. If you like waiting an hour for food, and never getting your drink refilled, this is the place for you.",

Also there's a new takeout menu, which is shorter but no less confusing.  Last night we brought home and shared:  #13 Pho Do Bien ($9) shrimp, squid, fish ball and fish pate. The shrimp was dry but aside from that an excellent, strong flavored Pho, we loved it.  and #7 Goi Ngo Sen Tom Thit ($13) Lotus Stem salad w/shrimp and pork. Very tasty \"salad\", could have used a bit more of the chili/fish sauce in my taste but I'd definitely order it again. I wouldn't want to make a whole meal of it but it's great for sharing as a side - albeit a bit pricey  Not the type of restaurant to take a date to, but it is what is: an oasis in this foodie hell neighborhood.",

    "text": "I'll start out by saying they JUST opened in the last week or 2 and the food was decent.  I plan to go back and I probably will end up raising my rating.  I walked in on a Friday afternoon around 1pm.  It looked kind of like a fast food place so I wasn't sure if I was to wait to be seated or not.  I stood there for a second and then a guy walked up and said \"1\"?  I said yeah, then a Vietnamese guy came in behind me and they sat him instead.  No biggie, but not very nice.  Anyhow, I was seated right after.  I looked through the menu and this is much more than just a Pho restaurant, but that was in the name, so I figured I'd give it a try.  I also looked for a lunch special, but there was no getting out of hear for under $8.  I ordered the Pho Dat Biet XE LUA.  Pretty much a Big OLE bowl of pho with everything in it.  I asked him what stripe was and the waiter pointed to his stomach, I said oh, tripe?  He didn't understand.  I guess misspelling on the entire menu.  So, I said no stripe please.  The pho came quickly with the normal frills of sprouts, basil, and peppers.  The soup was rather bland, but there was a lot of meat(including tripe) and rice noodles.  I added some of the very fresh basil, a little hot pepper sauce, some fish sauce, and now it had some flavor but still not that great.  I tried harder to get some flavor by adding more heat, and before i knew it, my water was empty.  I waited and waited and ended up walking up to the counter for it.  Never saw my waiter again.  Once I finished, I waited and waited for the check, went back up to the counter for that.  I paid and left.  Maybe this place was a self-service/fast food kinda joint and I didn't know how to work it right.  Hopefully these guys will see this and get there act straight.  They have a great source of food with the Super G mart right there.  All in all, it wasn't that bad, it just wasn't that good.  The service was horrible.  I will be more adventurous in my meal choice next time.",

The interior is more akin to a break room at work rather than a restaurant, but I figured what they weren't spending on decor/ambiance would be compensated gastronomically. I ordered the Banh Xeo (pancake) with shrimp along with an avocado bubble tea. Overall, the food was ok. Didn't hate it but wasn't too impressed. The pancake was a little greasy, and the shrimp was not particularly flavorful, nor were the vegetables that came with it. The avocado smoothie was good though, and the service and speed of delivery I had no problem with. It's a no-frills place, which is ok. Perhaps just not a great night? I wouldn't be against giving it a second chance (I'm guessing this is more of a pho place than standard Vietnamese entrees) but am not in a hurry to get back either.",

I was so disappointed, I also had the Vietnamese egg rolls which was just carrots rolled up and fried. We also had the Bun Bo Que it was the first time I ever tried it and it was hard to take down pate smelled and tasted horrible like an old sponge. I lastly asked for a boba tea and I was told they didn't have mango or the boba for the tea and they could replace it with jelly. I would not recommend coming here at all business was slow and so was the service even though our waitress was nice and knowledge. Bus boy had some sneakers on that smelled so bad like if they had been out in the rain grown mildew and then worn continuesly. I had a bad experience but I could deal with bad service but the bad food I couldn't take.",

The pho is not bad and the vermicelli is pretty good, but they do nickel and dime you for every little thing most Asian restaurants happily give for free. Most importantly, they have the worst service of any restaurant I've ever been. This last visit finally made me write a review. If you are in a crunch for time please don't come here. My food always takes an hour to come out, and half the time they get it wrong. The waitresses try to remember orders when they should be writing it down. Only come here if you have more than 2 hours to waste.",

    "text": "This is my go-to lunch spot when I drive down to Super G to do the groceries, it fills me up so I don't go crazy buying absolutely everything at Super G.  This place is your basic Pho spot, simple cafeteria style tables and nothing more, but what else do you really need when you have a bowl of delicious Pho in front of you. I don't remember the number, but I always get my Pho with rare beef, tendon, tripe, and meatballs. As always, they bring you a plate with limes, jalapeno slices, bean sprouts and basil. One of the things I love most about Pho is the fact that everyone gets the same stock but it is completely customizable with all the garnishes, Sriracha, Hoisin, and garlic chili sauce. My husband loves his stock just as it is, but I like to customize mine with a little of all of the above and a lot of Sriracha and jalapenos, the more my nose runs, the better!  The iced Vietnamese coffe is also very good here, and I never leave without having a cup! The owner's kids that are normally waiting tables are super friendly and if you ever want to venture out of your comfort zone they will be happy to recommend something from the menu. One very important thing I forgot to mention is that unlike many pho places, they actually offer different sizes. After about 5 times of eating there and taking more than half of my Pho home, the waitress suggested I try the \"kids\" bowl and that is what I always get now. I am definitely a good eater, but I can barely finish the kids portion. Another good tip we got from them is how to overcome the never ending pho bowl illusion: you must eat the noodles first and then the broth, the longer the noodles sit in the broth the more they expand and that is what creates the never ending bowl!",

I arrive early and ask the waiter should I get the rolls with beef or the pork and shrimp ones.. He was all about the beef and he was correct.  I had never had the fresh rolls with beef. They were stuffed with noodles & lettuce and I would get tiny fresh ginger or lemongrass bites.  It really turned me on. That alone was worth the trip and if I were close by, I think I would just pop in for a little snack.  I also ordered vermicelli with pork, shrimp and spring roll and a vietnamese coffee.  Our tab was $33 for two.  So it isn't exactly cheap for lunch, but worth it and worth the drive to go try it.  Don't expect any frills, expect great food!",

They forgot the egg rolls which happens, but  then I had a lot of trouble tracking down my server (she wasn't the person who brought it out), and never came to ask if anything was okay.   After 15 minutes I was finally able to ask someone if they could ask my server to come to the table when she had a chance. She apologized but by that time I was really hungry and had to get back to work so I needed to eat the dish. Basically it was TONS of noodles and lettuce/cilantro but very little of anything else. I found the dish underwhelming.  I waited another 10 minutes to get the second half of my meal,  by then I just ate alone and not on top of the dish.   My server never came back so  eventually I just went up to the front to ask if I could pay. There wasn't any language barriers or issues like that, and the place was not very busy. Unfortunately i just think it was poor service...  Also not sure what the fuss about it being so much for the price...mine was $12 with tip (I had water) which isn't exactly cheap but fairly on par ?   I would return and try the Pho because I did see potential food-wise. I would not get a noodle dish again and I would not return on my lunch-hour when time is limited.",

Ordered a pho with rare beef n beef tendon. U know the rare beef cooks in the hot broth by the time u receive it. We're use to eating at East Hartford (CT) Pho 501 where the broth has bn made steeping for a long time for a rich, heavy experience. Miss it. This broth here was \"okay\" for $7.75.   The noodle is manufactured, not homemade...a lil on the stiff, not fully cooked side but \"okay\" for $7.75.  Portion was appropriate.   The rare beef was a lil disappointing as it was overlooked n tough by the time we got it. Read in a previous review we should hv ordered the cooked flank as it's tender.  Next time we will if we want to eat something to warm us up while in the area.   Prices are reasonable for pho. Posted pics of the menu so u all can decide for yourselves.   The setting is more like a cafeteria with a wide open feel. Do recommend they think about the music selection.",

The Pho with tenderloin and shrimp (aka Michael N combo pho) was delicious and the Vietnamese Beef Stew with carrots was \"get in a space ship and orbit the earth\" out of this world - so much flavor!! The usual toppings, sprouts, limes, jalapenos and cilantro - but wait -  what's this super spicy green thing?! Culantro!! We now interrupt this review for a station break brought to you by Wikipedia - culantro (aka spiny coriander - aka Eryngrum foetidum, which the Latin translates to \"foul smelling thistle\") is a member of the cilantro family and used in some Vietnamese cooking. Let's just say culantro blew my mind and kicked my Pho in it's great big noodle butt.  Great place to have lunch if you're out at Super G, car shopping or if you just want to eat their awesome stew!!",

The food didn't take long to prepare and came out pretty quickly.  The spring rolls were small compared to what I've had before, but they tasted ok.  The vermicelli bowl was very skimpy on toppings but was full of noodles.  Overall, this place was just ok, but I'm use to much better and more quality meals at Vietnamese restaurants.",

I ordered 2 orders of crispy fried spring rolls by phine and after li mi g it up while heading home I decided to eat one when i saw that they gave me fresh spring rolls. I brought it back and patiently waited for my order to be made correctly. On my way home i started to eat them and tasted no meat. I called to ask if the rolls they gave me should have meat. It is supposed to have pork and carrots. They said I could bring it back for refund or something else. When i got there i showed the owner the roll and she pointed to the little pebble of meat and said see there's the meat. I told her I was vietnamese and ate there lots of times and never complained about the food before and I have eaten the rolls before. She proceeded to take me to the kitchen to show me how they're made. I told her I understood they may not have done it purposely but I was hungry and expected some meat. She said she was not going to give me a refund or offer any other food. The you g female cashier said it was probably because I already returned one order. But I told her I returned the order because it was not what I ordered and it was their mistake not mine. See the one piece of meat below in the pic. I will never eat here again because i can't believe how the owner handled this situation. She should be ashamed of herself, so much",

Since relocating to Charlotte I have eaten at this restaurant about 4 times over last month. My last visit was with my 7 year old son that loves vietnamese food, s Especially, \"sour rice\". Steamed rice with clear/orange colored fish sauce poured over it are both of my boys favorite, and they have it every single time we eat at any vietnamese restaurant.  Upon ordering food to go for the rest of our family I attempted to order a side of steamed rice with a side of fish sauce. I was told that they do not give fish sauce without an order of food that comes with it. Even upon asking if I could pay for the side of sauce,  the employee refused. I have lived all  over the country (San Francisco,  Chicago,  Birmingham, even Macon GA, just to name a few) and I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED that objection to a side of sauce at any vietnamese restaurant or any restaurant period. I am so incredibly disappointed and sadly my family and I will not be returning. I just can't understand, we offered to pay for the sauce (which we have never had to do for fish sauce in the first place)!!!!",

I dont recommend this place to anyone I dnt think they understand what about if I am allergic to the sauce. I wonder how much they have for the insurance.  But will never come here again there not friendly, food is bad, there boba is full of milk there is no taste please there is another vietnamese restaurant around the corner. No star at all to this place very dissappointing.",

    "text": "We tried Pho Huong Que last weekend and had a great experience. It's modest exterior makes it blend into a large shopping complex but it really is worth trying. This restaurant uses fresh ingredients to create authentic and perfectly delicious dishes.   Pho Huong Que lacks the overbearing (and sometimes quite stale) grease that often overpowers food (and the scent in the air) in many Vietnamese restaurants. As a result, you won't leave this restaurant feeling weighed down, rather their food has a refreshing quality to it.  Arrive early as they seem to run out of popular ingredients quickly (there was no beef by 5PM on Sunday night).   The interior is clean and comfortable but do not expect ambiance...go here for the food. Waitstaff are friendly and attentive and prices are very reasonable.  I recommend the house special pork dish which offers up loads a variety of flavors; a tiny Vietnamese meatloaf, perfectly cooked thinly sliced BBQ pork chop, interesting ginger noodles, a fluffy egg dish, steamed rice, and a sampling of vegetables. I'd also recommend the shrimp spring rolls; very large fresh pieces of shrimp wrapped in a perfectly fresh paper thin rice wrapper with crunchy veggies + a dynamite peanut butter sauce.  We would certainly visit Pho Huong Que again based on this experience.",

Every member is just as friendly and courteous as the next.   Although it can take a bit longer to place an order and to even receive it which is the downside but hey, the kindness of everyone makes up for it.   I'm a usual pho dac biet kind of girl BUT when we are dining here, I lean towards their spicy bun bo hue. You can request it to be not spicy. It will consist a variety of pork items.   My husband is the pho ga type of guy and will only accept it if it has beef broth which has more flavor. (In our opinion)   Their bubble tea is good. They offer a wide variety of flavors that other pho places doesn't. The Thai tea, coconut and green tea are our favorites. They can combine flavors as well. Such as pina colada. :)   If you're in the area and are hungry, be sure to stop by.",

    "text": "Pho Huong Que is at the opposite end of the Super G plaza off Independence Boulevard, and it's worth a visit.  My first stop here was in the spring when I had come down with a nasty cold and wanted the relief only pho could bring. My favorite spots are in Uptown, but feeling sluggish, I found the closest Vietnamese spot near my house and made the journey.  The menu is organized a bit oddly, but you can order by number, if you don't feel confident in your Vietnamese pronunciation.  The pho is divine. The broth is full of flavor and warms you from the inside out. They're not skimpy on meat or noodles.   I've also had the bun/vermicelli bowl, and I can say that the pork is excellent. The dish is richly seasoned and filling.  The summer rolls are a must-order. Even my father, who is a bit wary of authentic Vietnamese food, was raving about the summer rolls. Be heavy-handed when you add the peanut sauce; it's top-notch.  The only thing that keeps me from giving five stars is the ambiance, which is to say -- there is none. It's brightly lit with cheap tables and chairs and no real personality. There's a big television in the rear playing arbitrary stations -- last time I was treated to the end of Hook with Robin Williams. Could be worse, but I'd love to see the place spruced up a bit.  Overall, this is a solid place to get your noodles on. Prices are reasonable, service is quick, and the food is great. I'm thankful to have a nice pho spot in my neighborhood.",

My pho was fresh, the broth was tasty and the basil and bean sprouts on the side were all colorful and great accompaniment.",

I recommend to give this place a try. You will definitely not be disappointed!",

Ordered beef combination soup with brisket and vietnamese spring roll(fried one), combination rice flat noodle. Rice flat noodle has abundant veggies and meat and shrimp! But some of noodles were stuck together. Overall satisfied with their service and food. 3 stars and a half! They recently added some dishes on the menu. Will try them sometime soon.",

It opens very early, so could be a great place for a weekend brunch.   I ordered the chicken pho because I have a cold. The broth was perfect - delicate and flavorful - with an ample amount of chicken, noodles and thinly sliced onions. It was served piping hot, and made me feel so much better. My companion had the beef pho, brimming with 4 different cuts of beef, with a broth that was hearty, without being overwhelming. Our server was attentive, and we didn't have to wait long for our food.   All in all, it was a very positive experience. High recommendation!",

Barely even touched it, because I thought it was a good idea since I dont want it. So, I asked if I could switch out and that I only ate it to taste it. They said no. No, because I already tasted it. Then I asked if we could leave it out of the bill cause I didn't touch it at all and I didn't like it. My husband asked them so nicely and one of the guys who worked there was glaring at my husband as if he was about to fight my husband. I've never had an experience happen where I was supposed to eat the food I don't like and they didn't even offer ways to help. Springrolls were overpriced. Pork was dry. Sweet fish sauce was too salty. Our server was sweet, but really?! How else was I supposed to know I didn't want it if I didn't taste it. You can't make someone eat or pay for something they don't like.",

I had the three meat beef pho and my husband had the fried rice and we also ordered some fried spring rolls. My hubs is not a huge fan of other Asian food such as vietnamese, thai, or indian. He enjoyed what he got and I enjoyed mine. I loved that the pho came with all the greens, bean sprouts, lime, and sauces for you to adjust it to your tastes (believe it or not, I've been to places where you have to ask for it or don't get it at all). While it was not as good as some homemade pho that I've had before, it was very good and we would def return here.",

I asked for a couple extra condiments and offered to pay extra for them and the staff was just completely incompetent at serving the customer. The woman cooking in the kitchen was awful so rude. She came to my box and ripped it open taking sauces out and only giving me one of each. I offered to pay for more or pay extra so I could take some sauces to go but after being so appalled by the horrible treatment I actually just cancelled my order. Worst experience ever and I'm still hungry and sick! If you like being treated like crap go ahead and try this place and you better eat there because they will only let you take 2 small sauces togo.

But I got regular pho rice noodles instead and why is there meatballs in my soup ?! I didn't want any meatballs !!!  Whatever, so I took out the meatballs and placed the meat slices and noodles in the soup cup and took a sip. Ahh!! The soup burnt my tongue !!! Should've have known, the soup is always extremely hot, but I couldn't wait, even though it burnt my tongue, the broth is actually pretty good!  Ok I forgive you for messed up my to go order, because your broth and meat are pretty legit! The broth is rich and flavorful and not overpowering with the spice.

Also ordered some spring rolls but somehow were given some other rolls.  It was okay.  When they brought out our bowls of Pho, I usually have a habit of trying the broth before adding the ingredients.  It had a strong smell of overly done beef.  That pretty much ruined it.  Even after adding the sauces and garnish, I could still smell the beef.    I will most likely not go back to this place.  On a scale of 1-10, 1 being BAD and 10 being GOOD......i gave it a 3.

    "text": "I never in my life have enjoyed Vietnamese food the way I have been enjoying it in Charlotte.  Who knew?!  And this place is pretty close to my home.... Dangerous!  The atmosphere is nothing super special, basic cafeteria style or pizza shop seating and decor and the location is right on E independence in Matthews which is convenient for me.  The food: so the bar for me has been set pretty high since having some fantastic vietcuisine in Charlotte thus far, but it's pretty good here!  The summer rolls are tasty and fresh, although I add a bit more spice to the peanut sauce.  The vermicelli dishes are flavorful and delicious and probably my fave.  I love the salad noodle combination with that stinky fish sauce... It's heaven! The crispy spring rolls were a little disappointing to me as they were more like skinny egg rolls than the light crispy wrapped in rice paper bars of goodness to which I have become accustomed.  I will probably just not order those again but I will be back.  I have not yet tried the pho here (mainly because of how much I have been lovin the vermicelli!) but I have high hopes based on my fellow yelpers' reviews (you guys never steer me wrong!) and I think on my next visit I will try one of those egg pancake things.  They look delicious too. I am anxious to add another star(but don't mess with my crispy spring rolls). I have high expectations!",

    "text": "I went to Pho Huong Que looking for a good Pho soup and they certainly delivered.   The restaurant itself is not much more than you would expect from a strip mall style place and while everything inside the restaurant looked aged nothing appeared dirty. All of the utensils and serving dishes were clean the tables were wiped down.  I pretty much pigeon holed myself as I went there looking for a good Pho so that is what I went right after. I was impressed with their selection of different Pho soups you could choose from. There are about 20 on the menu with the base model being your usual ingredients of broth, rice noodle and beef slices. They apparently build off of the \"base model\" and you can order different variations which I look forward to trying out in due time. I also had the spring roll as a appetizer which was very delicious in and of itself. The spring roll app was served with 4 spring rolls each consisting of a couple shrimp, a strip of beef, rice, rice noodles, lettuce all wrapped in a rice paper. A added bonus I enjoyed was that the spring roll wasn't friend in any way so it was a lot more of a \"light\" appetizer.   With the Pho, spring roll app and tip my total tab came to around 16$. Some may consider it a little more on the pricey side but it definitely topped me off.   I would recommend anyone in the area who is looking for some good Vietnamese food to at least give this place a try.",

    "text": "I like Vietnamese food very much, and have tried many all around Charlotte. This restaurant opened up only recently, and I decided to take my mom out for lunch.   We ordered the fresh spring rolls. And what was surprising was that it came with 4 pieces!! All the other Vietnamese restaurants give you two pieces per order. So that was a pleasant surprise to start with.   Pho was good. I ordered Beef combo pho large, and my mom ordered seafood pho regular size. I would recommend against ordering the large size at this restaurant because there's really no significant difference in size. The broth was good. The service was good. The price point is lower than other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. I would definitely come back again and bring my friends with me.",

This is #29 on the menu: Spring Rolls - \"B.B.Q Steak wrapped in Rice Paper\" says the menu description...  Here is the scoop:  Picture This: Mint, Thai Basil and Vermicelli wrapped in Lettuce, then wrapped in Barbecued Steak then wrapped in Rice Paper served with Fish Sauce (my preference over the so called \"peanut sauce\" that looks and tastes like Hoison sauce with some ground peanuts on top).",

The shrimp is fantastic and the brown sauce is light and savory.  They will bring it with a little bowl of brown sauce with fresh sliced peppers for dipping.  It has a kick but also a smokey flavor that is fantastic.  The egg noodle dish is certainly plentiful enough for two persons if you want to share. This is a pho restaurant but we've not tried any yet because of all of the other entree choices!  The spring rolls and egg rolls are awesome as well. Can't wait to go back.",

The pho is awesome, the prices are extremely reasonable, the bubble tea smoothies are the best in town (I think they use fresh fruit in a lot of them), and the people who work there are really friendly and always able to make suggestions or answer questions if you've never had some of their menu items before. I eat something from here at least once every two weeks, and I have had great food and service every time.",
