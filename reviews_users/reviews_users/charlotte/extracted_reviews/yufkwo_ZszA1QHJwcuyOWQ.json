    "text": "We had dinner last evening to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary at Corkbuzz.  We wanted a 'close' by us location wise and quaint atmosphere as it was just the 2 of us as we wanted to \"celebrate\" our day but had had a very busy weekend with family (our daughter is getting married and we had just hosted a party at our home) and this fit the bill perfectly for a quiet night just to ourselves!  Atmosphere is very nice and Corkbuzz has a \"cozy\" feel but yet it speaks volumes with the decor.   Nicely done!  The food was great (donuts were a nice 'ending' to a great meal!) and we enjoyed ourselves.  Definitely will be back!  Great job Corkbuzz!",

    "text": "I want to love Corkbuzz but instead will say I like it (have been there 3 or 4 times since its opening). I went to Corkbuzz on opening week for dinner with a group and the kitchen was slow which is to be expected for a new restaurant. I ordered the Roasted Chicken and a glass of wine and both were good. None of us had any complaints about the food or drink.  The next few times I went to Corkbuzz, I was with a group of girlfriends where we ordered mixed drinks, wine and appetizers to share. The wine list is extensive and awesome and predictably pricey -- especially given the location.    The good... -The food (Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, cheese plates, spiced nuts, olives) -The wine  The not so good... -The slow service (continued over multiple visits) -The very loud, ridiculously loud, dining area   The nit-picky... -Given the pricey wine list and high rent locale, I am not that impressed with the decor and space. Corkbuzz reminds me of a basic space that you'd find in a hotel designated lounge/wine/hangout area. It reminds me of a lobby.",

    "text": "We started off with the goat cheese dumplings and cheddar nduje biscuits which were delicious.  We enjoyed good wine.    However, the entree left a lot to be desired.  I had the pork (as I was told this was one of the most popular). The pork shoulder lacked clean chunks of meat.  There were Brunswick stew pieces pieced piled up and many of the pork pieces were pieces of fat.  Now, I am fully aware of the shoulder and the expected fat as I smoke these many times per year however at $26/plate I feel the meat could be a little more select.  My wife ate the gnocchi which in her opinion were well overcooked, slightly mushy (big no no in gnocchi land) and really lacked flavor.  The last thing I will comment on is the server, she was on it at first and then fell off.  When we didn't eat 75% of our entree she didn't once ask if they we were ok or how are meals were...  Unfortunately we will not head back to this place even with a great wine menu.  If you're gonna eat there I might recommend sticking to starters, sides, or charcuterie.",

I went with a group of four so was lucky enough to try an array of food. Somehow, they've managed to fit three of my favorite things into one, with the Bourbon and Bacon Salami (unreal!). I loved everything, but my absolute favorites were the Goat Cheese Dumplings and the Bourguignon Burger. Austin was our server and he was just the right amount of friendly and attentive. I was only visiting Charlotte, but next time I go back, I will for sure be going to Corkbuzz again. Highly recommend for anyone who loves good food and good wine!",

As mentioned by other reviewers, the bartender was incredibly rude which might be forgivable if his pours weren't so weak and overpriced.   For food, we ordered the sweetbreads, sea bass, pork shoulder and ham hock tater tots (which contained no traces of ham). Every bite was woefully under salted and forgettable, with the exception of the pork shoulder which was so terrible, we remember it well. I have never been so disappointed by a roast pork dish in the state of North Carolina. I could have done far better in a slow cooker.  It bears repeating because it is so simple, but where was the SALT?!  Expensive and underwhelming aptly describes our whole experience.",

It was good but was missing the bacon mushroom  jam that was supposed to be on it. My dessert was the chocolate cake...wasn't impressed at all. Overall not very impressed with the food but gave it 4 stars because the customer service was good. I suggest just go for the wine; not the food.",

We each ordered a glass of Spanish wine, mine was $11 Bobal & my husband had a $16 glass of Temperinillo which we felt was pricey but good.  We ordered a couple small plates, goat cheese balls which were delicious and duck confit empanadas which were fair.  We also ordered a $29 charcuterie plate.  We were shocked at the small amount of food on it for that price.  We are in Charleston at least 6 times a year & have been to Bin 152, Slightly North of Broad, Butcher & Bee, and others.  We have ordered many charcuterie plates & have never paid $29 (we paid less) & received much more food.  Corkbuzz' charcuterie consisted of 3 small triangles of goat cheese (meh) thinly sliced & 4 small triangles of sheep cheese (fair), 1 small 2 oz ramekin of liver pate (delicious), small ramekin of mustard, 6-8 half slices of bread, 6 thin pickle slices, 6 thin slices of chorizo & 3 thin slices of prosciutto (good).  We ended up having 2 glasses of the same wines, 2 small plates & expensive charcuterie & spent a total of $95.  We both agreed that everything was overpriced even in comparison to the above mentioned Charleston places.",

The selection of wines, outstanding.  Now let's move onto the areas of opportunity. The menu prices are quite high, and that's OK with me, if the food is stellar. Unfortunately, that is just not the case. My appetizer was the goat cheese dumplings, and I must say, they were quite delicious, though the portion was very small. (6 small bite-sized dumplings for $9) My dinner however was a burger, I can't remember the exact menu name, I believe the plate ran $15. I found the texture and quality of the meat patty to be subpar. The burger lacked flavor in my opinion. The fries were very pliable and greasy, versus crisp and fresh tasting. I honestly did not report my concerns about the food, when asked about my meal. That would be my mistake. However, I opted not to for whatever reason. It was probably because the server was so outstanding, I did not want to offend. Overall, save your money, if you want a high-quality meal. However, if you are going there for drinks and an exceptional ambience, this is your place.",

The private room is indeed private. The door and walled-off space definitely helped reduce the noise from the restaurant, and the room has its own sound system so you can choose to listen to music or not. One of the amazing things though was that there was not a charge to use it on a weeknight. Another awesome thing was the service. The waitstaff was very pleasant and very accommodating to our group. They let us control the pacing for the evening and did not rush us to order or to get out. I look forward to dining in the main restaurant space soon.",

The wine selection is varied and the waiter was helpful to guide our choices based on our favorite types of wine.  A bit on the higher end, $13 burger & 10-15 for wine, but you're in South Park so that's expected.   Cons---  So So loud! It reminded me of Grand Central or the airport because it was echoing, too loud!! Yes I've lived in NYC so I'm used to loud places, big crowds but this was over the top. You couldn't really have a conversation or relaxing time. I wonder why they haven't used some acoustic tiles to lessen the racket.  They seemed understaffed for the big crowd, so everything took a long time. They might be better in a few months when they get all the new hiccups out of the way.  I'd give it another go but I can think of other wine bars that are a bit better for a relaxing dinner.",

    "text": "Restaurant week review: wonderful food and service. I've been wanting to try Corkbuzz since they opened, having read about their story and of course the food. The restaurant was surprisingly much smaller than I anticipated, definitely make a reservation if you're planning to go on a busy night or weekend. We were treated to a glass of prosecco after mentioning being recently married, a really thoughtful treat. We started with the pork belly and corn dip appetizers. The texture and flavor of the pork was excellent, my husband really enjoyed it. The corn dip was good but not great, or lacked some depth of flavor and the pita-like chips were neither soft nor crispy, which didn't bother me but I can imagine some might dislike. We split a bottle of Spanish red wine that was less than $30 and excellent. For our entrees we had the crab linguini with chorizo and olives, and the rockfish with pickled vegetables and grits. We typically share some of our meals with one another and ended up swapping dishes because we each preferred what the other ordered! The pasta was a good mix of flavors and textures, though a bit salty. For dessert we enjoyed the bourbon chocolate cake and the ricotta donuts, both good. The donuts were hot and fresh!    One of my favorite part of this meal was the excellent service and appropriate pace of the courses. Sometimes restaurant week meals feel rushed even though they are a splurge for many people. we were comfortably able to take our time eating, drinking wine and enjoying one another's company. We look forward to trying the regular menu, as well as brunch.",

    "text": "We met friends here, and I was a little skeptical ahead of time as I am not usually a fan of the South Park area in general.  We lucked out with parking, but I saw there is valet also, so consider that a plus.  Because we were five people, there was a good sampling of menu items on the table to try.  The Hush Puppies w pimento cheese were very good. Hot and crisp and the sharp cheese flavor was a great compliment. The charcuterie platter was not all that, but we also tried the octopus which was tender and flavorful.  For vegetarians, the carrot gnocchi is a win, but I think the roasted cauliflower was one of the best dishes on the table with added roasted shallots, pecorino cheese, capers and lemon. I could have just eaten that and been completely satisfied.  Service was attentive.  I may not make it a point to revisit, but would not complain if someone else suggested it.  Worth a try if you have not been there.",

I've come here on several occasions bringing my spouse, family and friends. I would HIGHLY recommend it. I have had their burger, many items on the brunch menu and have eaten here twice for restaurant week. You will not be disappointed. The spinach crepe was outrageous! I am by no means a spinach fan but I wanted to try something different as an appetizer, well holy cow, it was incredible. Far bigger than an appetizer portion (definitely could share). We've also enjoyed their ricotta doughnuts which were just delightful, a light crisp dough with different dips, coated in sugar - man, you can't go wrong. I am looking forward to going back tomorrow night. I promise Corkbuzz will have you bragging to your friends and looking forward to your next reservation!",

Lots of seating options, including small tables and a private room. There is a 2000 bottle wine room that will look tremendous when fully stocked!  Service was gracious and knowledgable - our service person made great food suggestions, the manager chatted with us about pairings and we even had a chance to speak with Laura, the owner! Everyone was attentive, even though it was busy.  Food-wise, we had a couple of the starters - warm olives, and house made ricotta, along with the chicken-fried rabbit. All three were solid, but the ricotta is addictive! The chicken-fried rabbit was an unusual twist on a southern dish, and the warm gravy will be great when it's cooler outside!  The wine selection looks tremendous and paired with the food and attentive service I suspect Corkbuzz will be a hotspot in South Charlotte!",

    "text": "The interior of the place is fantastic and the wine list is as well.  The list is much better than The Wooden Vine, in my opinion, which supposedly has the best wine list in Charlotte.  There are, however, a few kinks which they must work out - which is completely understandable.    First, I'll start with everyone's first impression of the place - the hostess (who would be FIRED if I was the manager).  She did not welcome us and barely said hello.  I actually had to ask her if we could have a table.  She said, 'Yeah just sit.'  She did not offer us a menu or wine list.  The place was not busy, yet we sat for a few minutes (as in perhaps 5 minutes) before someone greeted us by asking whether we were offered the wine list.  I said no and THEN the hostess brought them over.  FIRED.  We were told that we could still order dessert or cheese, but when I asked my server 5 minutes later if we could order dessert, we were told no.  No big deal.  It was late.  I get it.  From the time we were seated to the time we actually got our bottle of wine, it was about 25 minutes, which was kind of ridiculous because it was very late and business was slow.  The manager or sommelier was very knowledgeable about the wine we ordered and was able to converse with my guest who is an international wine researcher and winemaker, which was a plus.  Our server was nice, but she seemed very nervous and not confident with the wine.  Last bitchy comment I have is that they were playing 80s music - Janet Jackson, etc., which seemed extremely weird and unfitting for the environment.    I will absolutely be back as I feel this place is a real jewel minus the kinks.  I want to try the food and will definitely be back for the wine.  PS  Fire the hostess!",

It is my understanding there are only three restaurants. The staff was very friendly and assisted me in choosing my wines. The four of us ordered different entrees and decided to share with each other.  We started out with a burgundy red for around $65. Followed by three appetizers which were on the lighter side. The cheese dumplings were small but tasty and the beets were also shaved thin but delicious. Each of us had a different entree the Seabass the pork the gnocchi and the sirloin entrees.  I asked the staff to help select the second bottle of red which we preferred to be a little bolder than the first so we ended with a nice Bordeaux red wine for another $65.  We saved enough room for dessert of course and ordered three different desserts the fudge trio the waffles with chocolate and peanut butter and my favorite doughnut balls with a ricotta dipping sauce. The coffees were delicious as well as the Drambuie cordial I ordered.  Entire bill for the four of us was $335 which included two bottles of wine. It's only been open about a year and a half and although it was my first time I'm most excited to return again.",

Somewhat heavy like a biscuit but have the hint of honey but not dry!! The butter was great.. 1st course was the pork belly with the grilled corn salad. Omg, this I love.. The outer shell was crispy and interior was soft and somewhat creamy.. And with the grilled corn. It pulled everything together! 2nd course: crab linguine. It's on the spicy side of me.. And I don't care for spicy.. Everybody else said not.. But still very yummy.. I'm humming the whole time under my breathe. Then the surprise of the night.z their awesome Graham Cracker Creme Brulee.

As soon as we were seated, our server, Julia, explained that on Monday nights if you purchase a bottle wine, Corkbuzz sends you home with an additional free bottle of the wine that you purchased. What a wonderful idea!    We shared the goat cheese dumplings which were light and flavorful. I selected the Corvina Sea Bass for my entree while my companions had the Bourguignon Burger and the Local Lettuce Salad and Short Rib Beef Tartare.  One entree was better than the next,  and we each enjoyed our selections very much. The food was creative and absolutely delicious. Every bite was a treat.  We finished our dinner with a fabulous dessert, Ricotta Doughnuts. Our server, Julia, treated us as if we were guests in her own home. She made us feel very welcomed and assisted us in making wonderful selections. I dine out a lot,  and the food and service at Corkbuzz is absolutely excellent. This is a great restaurant, and I'm sure that I will be back many, many times in the future!",

Elena was our server and she was very conscientious and extremely knowledgeable about the wines and dishes we ordered.  It is a wine bar with a limited menu and beer list, but everything we ordered was impeccable. We mostly ordered off the Lighter menu. It's a bit of a different concept as they are tapas but served family style. For example the pork meatballs with a parmesan sauce we ordered had 6 mini meatballs which were divine. We also ordered 2 shrimp & calamari, and 2 ceasar salads, which was shared by all. All of our dishes were not run of the mill, they each had their unique and flavorful twist.  Elana brought my cabernet sauvignon but also brought 3 other wines for tasting. She was extremely knowledgeable and took the time to educate us on each of the wines she brought us.  An excellent experience. Will be back again!",

Neither of us had been before, so we didn't know what to expect.  Our server, Andrew, was exceptional.  He had great suggestions across the board and was very knowledgeable and comfortable talking about our wine and scotch selections. We started with goat cheese dumplings with a \"spicy\" shrimp sauce (not even a hint of spice, which suites me just fine, but probably shouldn't be in the description) and salmon flatbread with a dill and chive cream cheese spread and fried capers.  Both of these starters were outrageous.  So delicious! We were a little less enthusiastic about our entrees.  I had the Sea Bass.  One piece was very dry, but the other was perfect.  Well seasoned with a nice crispy sear.  It was described as coming with pickled cabbage and beans, which didn't end up as I expected.  It was more of a bean dish with two small pieces of sea bass and a tiny bit of cabbage that I probably wouldn't have noticed had it not been in the description. My fiance got the pork shoulder.  The horseradish in the sauce was OVERWHELMING! Far too much horseradish.  The pork shoulder should have been flavorful enough without drowning it in the sauce.  We will never know.  The sides were delicious (Brussel sprouts and cheesy potatoes).  For dessert we had a peanut butter pie and apple cobbler with a stout ice cream.  Both were amazing, but by this point, we were so full we couldn't come close to finishing.  The atmosphere was perfect and the service was impeccable.  It would have been 5 stars if the entrees had hit the mark.  I will absolutely come out again for wine and small plates with my girlfriends!  Looking forward to giving it another try!",

    "text": "The decor and atmosphere was pleasant,  very \"South Park meets NYC\".  The bartender was nice enough.  Seemed slightly indifferent, no friendly vibe whatsoever, but not blatantly rude. He was very quick to refill when needed.     I only had the wine,  a syrah blend.  Was it a nice wine?  Yes. Was it worth  $13 a glass?  To me,  no.    Maybe I'm just a simple girl who doesn't understand wine (or places like this).  But I'd rather spend $13 on a bottle and stay home in my sweats..... and get white girl wasted solo.   If you are OK with spending $12-15 per glass go here,  you won't be disappointed.  I'll continue being super classy and drinking my Harris Teeter bought wine at home.  (Would go back,  but only if someone else is buying...)",

    "text": "I have been looking forward to the opening of Corkbuzz Charlotte for months and it certainly lived up to expectations! The layout is beautiful and the music is upbeat - both help to create a friendly and inviting ambience. Most impressive for me was the food, perhaps the best I've had in Charlotte. The gougeres, braised octopus, chicken-fried rabbit, clam spaghetti, and bourguignon burger were a few standouts but honestly everything I tried was tremendous. The staff is also extremely knowledgeable about wine and gave us great recommendations to pair with each dish.   They also have some unique weekend promotions that are worth checking out. They offer blind tasting wine flights on Fridays that are perfect for a date. And Champagne Campaign (50% off all bottles of Champagne) is offered all day Saturday and Sunday.   Can't say enough good things - Corkbuzz is the perfect addition to Charlotte!",

Corkbuzz definitely exceeded our expectations as far as service, professionalism, knowledge, and quality of food and drink. And this was their soft opening!!  When you walk in, you can definitely see that this place came straight from New York. The ambiance is very cool, very modern, chique. I'll admit, when we both opened the menu, neither of us recognized many styles of the bottles, but they didn't treat it pretentiously. We told our waitress about the styles that we normally like, and she recommended a fantastic french wine called... *checks phone*...eh, doesn't matter, it was a Cotes du Rhone. And it was fantastic.   What I really like is Corkbuzz's policy on tasting. They pour a little bit table-side and let you taste anything before you commit to it, even glasses. What a cool policy.  We ordered food as well; I got the burger and it was out of this world. A couple other people at our table ordered some oysters which were great as well.   Overall, it was a great experience. Corkbuzz's great food and great service complement each other like cheese and... I'll let your mind be responsible for the cheesiness.",

I know they like to keep things moving especially on a night during restaurant week. They have a very large wine selection although I felt not enough mid-priced bottles compared to the number of higher priced ones. And when I say mid-priced I mean $80-120.  I really think a wine bar should have a thorough cross section. They also had a list \"designated\" for Restaurant Week. I did have a nice glass of the Cuvaison Chardonnay which isn't as oaky as most Chardonnay wines.  Now to the food, my selections were the seared  butternut squash crepe, corvina Seabass, and the ricotta donuts. All three dishes were outstanding, particularly the Seabass. The service was great as well. She visited the table often to make sure we had what we needed. Overall, a nice dinner in a restaurant I had not been to before.",

It does not make sense to put ikura caviar on a already salty smoked salmon. And the smoke salmon tasted old.   Second course  Braised pork shoulder and potato gnocchi , portobello mushrooms   Nothing special. It just tasted like roast pork with sauteed mushrooms  Third course  Ricotta doughnut with cinnamon sugar, Almond milk  Which the best part of the dinner. Doughnuts was soft and airy. Not too sweet",

Their chef is working some magic too. Hands down best scallops I've ever had. I wish it was on their regular menu. The pork tenderloin is also delicious. The desserts are my favorite of course. I finally made it out for brunch and they did not dissapoint. Do yourself a favor and get the grits! They also have banana bread french toast.

    "text": "Beware of your expectations as you go to Corkbuzz.  I went into my evening at Corkbuzz as every red-blooded American husband would...  Begrudgingly appeasing my wife to try something new on our weekly date night out.   She had heard all of these rave reviews from Corkbuzz. I can't tell you the number of times I heard \"honey, did you know that all of the other locations are in Manhattan?\". \"It's supposed to be really good and their wine selection is regarded very highly!\" I heard.   All I heard through this was, \"wait until you SEE how big this bill is going to be!\" And my personal favorite, \"it's a wine bar, the portions are SUPPOSED to be small.\"  So - my wife sweetly made a reservation for this past Friday and we headed off to a date that I KNEW I would need to make a stop at McDonald's on the way home for a quarter pounder to fill the void in my stomach.  Well - all of those expectations and misconceptions were blasted away at the end of the evening. The wine was great (I'm not a big wino, so I got a flight to try a few out... personally I love Scotch and their Scotch selection is solid.) Then, we did the cheese and charcuterie plate, which every thing on it was incredible. Then, then came the Queens feast. I made the mistake of requiring my wife to get the charcuterie plate because I didn't think the meal was filling. I was BEYOND wrong.  I got the beet salad, because my Midwestern grandmother would roll in her grave if I didn't (rest her soul) and it was great, but my wife's Brussels Sprouts appetizer stole the show. Seriously delicious veggies.   On to the main course, I got the burger (which I expected to be a \"wine bite slider\" , wrong there) and my wife got the chicken. OK - I always make fun of my wife for getting the chicken, but the chicken was moist, well srasoned, and all around delicious.  Finally - desserts. The apple cobbler, awesome. The ricotta donuts, light fluffy and molten. All delicious.  Overall - our experience there was great and I'd highly recommend a dinner at Corkbuzz. It blew all of my misconceptions away and the food was great. Our service was also nothing but impeccable. Our server, Austin, knew the regular menu and the wine menu back and forth and was more than just a food delivery service, he really enhanced the experience.",

A friend of mine chose Corkbuzz for a wine tasting event based on the wines offered and menu items available. We had reservations for 6 people at 7:00pm.  Once we arrived we were taken to their private room that was divided into two parties, ours and one other that had not yet arrived.  To start the tasting off the manager and wine coneisseur went over how the night/tastings were going to work. They allowed us time to order some small bites to enjoy during the tastings. We chose to order two charcuterie platters, which came with some meat, cheeses and accompaniments, which were perfect.  We tasted six wines, which I thought was a nice variety, and received the history of each.  Once the tasting was over we enjoyed the remainder of the bottles, decided to have some dinner and dessert. We ordered a variety of food items which everyone seemed to enjoy.  The service was definitely slower, especially once the second party joined the room. Overall I enjoyed the tasting and food and would definitely go back as I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and would love to try some other items.",

The burger was really good too with some fancy cheese and other stuff. Will definitely come back again so I can try the rest of the menu. The menu is limited but what they have all sounds yummy!

I was very impressed with how out of the box some of their choices were. The food options are well thought out and they do a great job of helping match wines to pair with your food.   You should also know that they do regular wine tasting classes, wine 101, champagne 101, wines from different regions (France, Australia) and much more.  They can even source a wine for you. For example, if you are celebrating a memory from Tuscany, they can source a Tuscan wine to try to reciprocate what you are celebrating. They also have great private rooms for events. I came in with the Charlotte Food Bloggers group and it was absolutely perfect for a group and having private and individualized attention.   We started with scallop noodles, which were amazing! They were served with apple, mint, jalapeno and lemon seasoning, and the flavors were perfect together. We next tried the veal tartare, a different twist on the typical tartare. It was servied with fermented cabbage, turnips and a quail egg, with a side of cheddar chips. The tartare was so flavorful, and I love the bitterness that the fermented cabbage added. The cheddar chips were unbelievable - thin and delicate, while full of flavor. AND YES TO THE CHEDDAR. They were so addictive.  One of my favorite dishes was the confit pork belly, which is served with pork tenderloin, roasted broccoli and gnocci. The combination of pork belly with pork tenderloin gave a unique contrast and the two cuts of pork almost tasted like two different meats. The gnocci was some of the best I've ever tasted. It was so chewy, cheesy and flavorful. I could eat it by the bowlful every day.   We also tried a unique twist on dessert - a avonlea cloth bound piece of cheddar cheese, served with blueberries, strawberry jam and rosemary toast. I'm usually a cake or ice cream girl - I like really sweet - but this dessert won me over for its more savory side. The rosemary toast was out of this world. It just went perfectly well with the cheese. I would even order this as an appetizer.   Very impressed with Corkbuzz's creative use of ingredients and flavors, and they have a very knowledeable team. I believe they have 2 or 3 sommeliers, including one of only 33 female sommeliers in the world. You'll find what you're looking for and more here, it's definitely MUCH MORE than just a place for happy hour wine and cheese. Check out their food menus next time you are in and you will agree",

We started with the Seasonal Tart, and let me tell you -- I WON'T be sharing that next time!  It was outstanding!! The Brussels Sprouts with marcona almonds and cheese curds were also well prepared and tasty.  We also enjoyed the flatbread and tried the Bourguinon Burger -- both delicious.  The standout was that tart though . . . . I'm already trying to plan my next visit.",

I have been a number of times over the last few months, and the food has not only been consistent, it has been exceptionally well prepared every time. From burgers and chicken to Wagyu steaks, you can't go wrong at Corkbuzz.   They also have a vast selection of great wines on hand and will even pair each course with a recommended wine.  Overall, the laid back atmosphere, attentive staff, great wine selection, and the amazing food make Corkbuzz a staple in my restaurant rotation.",

We tried the little retail shop first and had a glass of wine and some cheese/charcuterie - it was pretty good.   Then we moved to the main restaurant and they gave us a cute little table by the window. The service was slow, but the wine was good and most of the tapas we ordered were good. I really liked the little honey drizzled bread and the cauliflower.   The server made some recommendations about the wines that were insightful, that was refreshing.  Overall it was a solid experience and they were pretty cool about arranging the table for our group when one person didn't show up etc.",

The bartender was very attentive, and his recommendations were on point. I began with the flight of Spanish wines. Really enjoyed it. We enjoyed some apps-gougeres (not what I'm used to-made with goat cheese), but good. We had two cheeses and a meat, the Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.  The Brussels sprouts were our of this wor! Perfectly seasoned and cooked, just the right amount of crispiness. The cauliflower was rich, but sooooo good. The cheeses combined with the salami were just right. Try the ricotta, and the wild boar salami!  I look forward to getting back to Charlotte soon for another great wine filled evening!",

    "text": "Holy yummy! Corkbuzz is uh-mazing!!! I actually had no plans of coming here until I won a 70$ gift card through a Yelp talk thread, thanks Nikki! But boy am I glad I won!   So we came during restaurant week and the menu was pretty lengthy for it being restaurant week. There were a lot choices and there was enough to satisfy anyone's taste. We started off with an order of the tater tots which were not on the restaurant week menu but so delicious! The mustardy sauce they were served with was a perfect added flavor. I got the beet salad for an appetizer (so good and I don't normally eat beets) but anything with goat cheese in the mix I'll take! My boyfriend got the crab bisque, creamy and satisfying (and again, another thing I usually don't enjoy!). The pork tenderloin was out of this world! So tender, and tasty and the apple slaw added a sweetness that I wasn't expecting! I tried my boyfriends shrimp orrichiette, OMG, this restaurant just kept getting better and better. All I can say is creamy and cheesy!!!   The dessert might have been the best part. The ice cream sandwich was no ordinary dessert. Perfectly crunchy cookies with hazelnut ice cream and Nutella! The doughnuts with ricotta dipping sauce...outstanding. They were so warm and clearly made fresh! I was sooo full by the end of this meal but still wanted more, always a good sign!    The overall experience was fantastic. The interior is really nice, dim lighting, romantic setting if you're looking for a nice date night. The service was a little slow but I blame that on restaurant week, not for a lack of caring on the employees part. But regardless, I cannot wait to return to Corkbuzz and try the full menu!",

    "text": "Two girlfriends and I had reservations at Corkbuzz during restaurant week. I will go back because I'm dying to try the braised short ribs and I very much enjoyed the food and wine. The beginning of our experience was not great in that my friend had made reservations a couple weeks prior for a party of six, then changed to a party of 3. She called at 4 pm on the day of our 6 pm reservations just to confirm. On the way to the restaurant, she received an email that our reservation had been cancelled. The staff was very nice and accommodating, and we enjoyed the wine recommendations and charcuterie while we waited at the bar, but this is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. Big faux pas to inadvertently cancel a reservation, imho.  The food was very good. Do not visit without trying their house made ricotta and apple chutney with a nice full-bodied red. Heaven in the mouth. The truffled salami was awesome as was the very unique crisp yet creamy smoked Gouda. Their house made Dijon was also outstanding, if we're being detailed.   Apps: we had the Smoked trout dip, Brussels sprouts and Wagyu Beef carpaccio. All were good. The smoked trout dip came with house made chips and though good, was my least favorite as I felt it was similar to other dishes elsewhere. Just not that special. The Wagyu beef carpaccio was quite good as was the presentation with a poached egg in the center. My favorite was the Brussels sprouts - grilled with fennel, marcona almonds and tossed with cheese curds it was delicious!  I had the pork tenderloin, cooked medium and it was absolutely cooked to perfection and the apple slaw was a perfect compliment. One of my friends had cornmeal-crusted catfish which I do not believe it is on the regular menu but it was also delicious. My other friend had the shrimp orecchiette and it was quite good - very hearty 'comfort food' type dish. We also got the ham-hock tater tots (great!) and roasted spaghetti squash (not my fav). All was very good and we really were too stuffed for dessert. But...  We tried the ricotta doughnuts, chocolate chip cookie sandwich with hazelnut ice cream and apple cobbler with cinnamon ice cream. The ricotta donuts were sugared donut holes with a ricotta cream. Good but like the cookie, not over the top delicious. I was hoping for more of the regular house-made ricotta, yum. My favorite was the apple cobbler - sugar biscuit crumble, very tasty.   All in all Corkbuzz was a nice little wine and venue. A little pricey but what you expect in the area. The space is tight and acoustics maybe need to be softened, but overall I'd recommend for the food, service and wine list. Enjoyed.",

The classes are extremely informative and well worth a 2-hour break from your busy life, if you have any interest in wine!  The selections of the 6 wines they choose for their tastings are fantastic and expose you to a wide variety of the wine class you are attending!  After the classes, I found myself investigating the wine listings at the bar and have been very impressed with their selection!!  Additionally, the food from appetizers to the main dishes have been great!!  I highly recommend and applaud Corkbuzz for everything they are doing to advance the love of wine and food!!!",

And then stayed out for some more wine and foods at the wine bar. Beautiful setting and friendly staffs are always a plus. Foods are amazing- charcuterie board and the pastas- and the wine list is excellent. I love the way how the wine list is mixed with what's familiar and something I never heard of before. After all, it is a wine bar, and what's the fun if it doesn't give a new experience in the world of wine?   I would definitely recommend it for the foods and especially for the wine that takes you out of your comfort zone  and come back to check out next door their Cellar for some fun wine classes",

Service was lacking at tables around us as well. Almost everyone seated around us had empty wine glasses. Wine took another 15 minutes to come out after ordered. Bottle was sold out, of course, substitution was made but was more expensive. And no, they don't honor the cost of what you actually ordered. Food was very mediocre and lacked flavor. At 9pm our waitress dropped off the bill and rushed us out, apparently they don't close until 10. $180 (before tip!!) for 2 of the cheapest bottles of wine on the menu and 3 sub par appetizers. I will absolutely never return to this establishment. Go 1/2 mile down Fairview Road to Foxcroft Wine. Your bill will be half the price and the experience will be outstanding. I'm shocked this place has 4 stars. I find it incredibly hard to believe I experienced this on a bad night. It seems to be their norm.",

I was obsessed with finding out when they were opening....  ....and then they did...  My first experience here was really incredible.  My hubs signed us up for the Burgers and Rose wine tasting.  Although they had my hubs reservation wrong,  they caught it and called him twice to apologize and to reconfirm.  So problem solved even before we got there and they were sooooo nice about it.    We arrived a little earlier than planned and sat at the bar and ordered a glass of bubbly.  Bar tender was professional, and was nice.  Told us about the prosecco that we ordered and offered us a taste to see if we would like it.   Off to the tasting event we go!!   We move into a long dinning room with an elegantly decorated table.  The rose had already been poured into 6 different wine glasses all sitting on top of numbered spaces ...so you could quickly reference which wine you were drinking.  Hard to explain but so well organized and beautifully presented.    I felt awkward because I am just starting out my journey in learning about wines so I just knew that everyone that had signed up for this class were going to be wine know-it-alls....boy was I wrong.  The atmosphere was relaxed and everyone was nice, engaging, and there to have a good time and learn! The guy teaching us went through the history of rose, where it started from, how it's made and the regions of the wines we were tasting.  So much fun and I actually learned something!  Most wine tastings are not as knowledgable or its a distributor trying to get you to buy a certain wine but don't know anything about the process.  Not this fella...he knew his stuff!  After tasting the six different wines, our food came out and we kept getting top offs of whatever wine you wanted to try again...and again...and OMG.  Lol!   I almost forgot to write about the food!  The burger was had was ridiculous in a good way.  Nice fat juicy burger with some type of garnish that was amazing.  Totally impressed.   The wine prices are RETAILLLLL not restaurant rip off.  I bout two bottles.  So well worth it!   I seriously will be celebrating my birthday, Christmas, sunny days, wine down Wednesday's at this establishment.  There is a patio for our door seating, and complimentary valet because parking is a bit challenging in that location.  The restaurant interior is small however I think that's pretty cool. It forces more intimate conversations in smaller groups.    *standing and clapping* Well done Corkbuzz.  You had me had hello.",

Waitress would randomly interrupt conversation by yelling over us versus just saying excuse me...it was awkward. We got a cheese board chef selection and ricotta with bread to start. First, why would the chef gives us another thing of ricotta when we clearly already ordered that and you only get 3 cheese on the board? Cheese and meats were the only good thing other than the ricotta, it had zero flavor. They were out of several items which blows my mind at 7;30 on a Saturday with a very limited menu. Literally 2 out of like 5 meat options. Husband got burger it's small nothing special and fries were like half inch. Even said something to waitress but it was like they dumped the bottom of the fries in the basket. I got risotto again small portion and was super odd. It was pesto but the eggplant on top has a weird sour taste but it didn't go well together. The wine selection was good but definitely never ever would eat food here again. This place is way overpriced for what it's serving and now know why it was empty on Saturday and walks away hungry. Pass",

    "text": "This trendy new SouthPark wine bar and restaurant is absolutely one of the coolest spots in Charlotte to meet friends for a drink -- or a few. The main attraction is, of course, the ridiculously extensive wine list, and on that point Corkbuzz definitely doesn't disappoint. Our server recommended an outstanding Pinot Noir that he promised would be the perfect complement to our meal -- in truth, it was more like the highlight. As fabulous as the wine and setting were, the food was just not quite everything I had been hoping for.  Our Roasted Cauliflower appetizer was tasty, but the Parmesan Gnocchi I ordered for my main course was actually a little bland. At our waiter's recommendation, my wife ordered the Bourguignon Burger, which was was OK, but nothing remarkable. Dessert, however, was great: we shared a a sumptuous bourbon chocolate cake and delicious creme brulee.   The atmosphere was romantic, both inside and out, and the service outstanding. And for guests who aren't big on wine, there's also a terrific selection of cocktails and craft beer.  We'll definitely make another visit to Corkbuzz, and I'm hopeful that some of their other entrees will be as memorable as the wine and desserts.",

One of the big highlights is the staff... I've had some GREAT conversations with Irene (my new go-to wine guru!)  What a delight she is.  Friendly, sincere knowledgeable.. totally makes the experience.  I would like to see maybe some more \"specials\" or  less expensive wine by the glass, but hey... I'm coming back regardless.  Keep up the good work!",

We went during restaurant week, which can be a busier time for restaurants so I usually expect a bit of slower service. This service was abysmal and painful. They way overbooked and had someone serving an entire bar and several tables who seemed like it was his first day. One appetizer came out, then 20 minutes later we had to ask to check on the other appetizer. Burger was decent but meat was too dense and bun flavorless. Dessert was a saving grace and delicious. We had to keep having to track someone down to check on things or order more. We would have ordered a round of dessert wine to finish off the evening, but couldn't find someone to order from so just gave up.  Overall, service was horrible and we will not be back. Going back to Foxcroft's instead.",

    "text": "Wine bars are not really my thing. But a wine bar with food? I will definitely give that a try. So we checked them out on a weekend morning for their brunch menu. Actually showed up as they opened. And \"as they opened\" means at the time their hours said they opened.  Turns out the door was open, but no one was around. Stood looking goofy (which I do really well) for a few minutes, and was just about to leave when someone came out and seemed happy to see us. We were seated and a few minutes later our order was placed.  After a while, we had some food. It wasn't bad food, but it wasn't great.  And more importantly, the wait was loooong. If you're there for wine, and sitting and enjoying the wine, then it would probably not be an issue. But if you're going for a meal, and perhaps more importantly, have things to do, perhaps not the greatest choice.  The decor is nice, and the location is interesting - and there are other places around that also seem worth checking out as well - but if you want to go for a meal, it's probably not the best option.",

A buddy of mine and I wanted to treat another friend to a guys night and we all enjoy a good wine so we planned to meet here on a Monday night and see what it was all about.  When we arrived we were greeted at the door and given a run down of what the specials were. They just so happened to be having a sangiovese \"class\" (more of a tasting by the time we showed up) next door in the cellar so we started off with tasting 3 really good wines.   There wasn't much of a crowd so we figured we'd just eat on the cellar side of the bar.  The wine selection was great, although definitely pricey, bottle prices especially and the food was either hit or miss with the temperature and quality. We shared alot of the dishes and ended up being able to taste quite a few things, but didn't end up full by the end of the meal.   I will say the only downside was the service was kinda slow considering how few patrons were around.   I'd give this place a second try to see if my first visit could be topped.",

I loved the tiny pieces of Pistachios!!! I also had the pleasure of trying the churros, which were amazing! Light and airy! Came with three dipping sauces ( which you won't need)   They have a large wine selection. Kinda hard to narrow down. Our waitress suggested a Riesling, which was perfection!   I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here. I heard there's lots of specials each week. I definitely need to do my research. Oh! I almost forgot! The bottle!

    "text": "Friends and fellow Yelpers have written mixed reviews and expressed mixed feeling about Corkbuzz. Most of the negative feedback has been about the cost and not the food - the food has gotten great reviews. For the most part, unless some place just gets multiple terrible reviews I like to check things out and judge for myself.  My first impression walking in was \"Wow! This place is beautiful!\" It's got a nice fresh feel to it. Clean lines. For some reason it felt very \"LA\" or \"NYC\" - a \"big city\" atmosphere. Not the typical decor in these here parts. A sparkling wall of glasses behind the bar that makes a grand statement. Another nice feature is the long banquette.  Our server was friendly, chatty and knew a lot about both beer and wine. I like a knowledgeable server - it makes for both good conversation and good drink selections.  My bud Tonya and I met here for a drink so I could \"see for myself\". A round of drinks, one of them a beer, was $20. Part of it is that you are paying for location and atmosphere. The beer and wine list, as it should be in a place like this, was extensive and well selected.  The menu looks pretty orgasmic - the descriptions will make you hungry - you had me at cauliflower (which was the first item). Yes, prices are on high side but someone has to fill that niche in Charlotte. Looks like you could easily spend $50-$75 per person for dinner, appetizers and drinks.  Now for my overall impression - cool, upscale place to bring a date or to come for a special occasion. Saving up my do-re-mi so I can go for lunch or dinner.",

I think we were seated at the table around 9, which would have annoyed me if there weren't two seats left at the bar.  Things got better after we sat down.  We decided to try the pork belly flat bread, it was good, not exactly what we expected though.  It was more like simple pork belly nachos I'd say than flatbread.  Small pieces of pork belly on fried pieces of dough with some baby spinach and dressing on top.  It was good, but not \"flatbread\".  I had the tuna and she ordered the fried chicken.  Luckily the two tables next to us got their food before we ordered so we could see what some of the dishes looked like.  The tuna was delicious, and a large portion.  It came with a corn and zucchini tart and blistered shishito peppers.  I didn't try any of the chicken but I'm told it was very good (my friend, as well as the ladies next to us raved about it).    The service was mostly very good.  Like I said, a little annoying having to wait to be seated for a reservation, not the end of the world though.  Our server was personable and attentive and I gotta give him credit for handling the shenanigans at the tables around us without getting flustered (they were clearly enjoying themselves, and their drinks).    That leads us to the dining room decor and atmosphere.  It's a very pretty place, chic and modern decor.  It's not very big though, so I'm sure they get booked up fast for busier times.  I was surprised that it was so loud too.  Corkbuzz would be a good place for a date or girls night out.",

That was no problem, I got the glass of wine I ordered and then got to keep the other. Being that the server did not write down the order, one of our tapas was also wrong (we had ordered Brussel Sprouts, but instead we received the Black Pepper Biscuits). My boyfriend and I overlooked this as the biscuits were delicious. We received the check, and everything was correct. The server took an extraordinary amount of time to retrieve the check and run the card. So much though, that his colleague came over, retrieved the check and ran our card. Once receiving the receipt to sign, we realize the bill had just jumped up by $20. The server must have closed out another table and charged us for their meals/ drinks. We quickly let the server know. She cancelled the transaction and ran the card for the correct amount. Now, we are sitting with a $100 hold on our account in addition to the cost of our meal/ drinks because of one of the many errors made at this place.",

She continued to try and explain that her computer tablet would not allow us to sit in the dining room because it would remove other reservations. So much for technology.  (I had asked for the manager, but the hostess was reluctant to get him). After getting back home, I called and asked to speak to the manager. He came to the phone and said that he had his rear dining room available and we could come back. I don't think so. The restaurant has lost a customer. This was not worth the inexperienced hostess hired in this supposedly NY establishment. Maybe this is how NY City treats their customers but this will not be acceptable to the Charlotte market. If you want to go, MAKE A RESERVATION! To be clear, I did not eat or drink here.",

We sat for 30 minutes watching him wait on everyone else, ignoring us; I thought we were invisible. He kept looking at us, but never said a word. Finally, he came over...\"so what will you have to drink\" was his greeting. Not, \"welcome to Corkbuzz\", not \"sorry for the long wait\", nothing.  We ordered wine and 2 appetizers.  Took awhile for the wine to be served and it was a very skimpy pour.  After a long wait, one appetizer finally came out.  It wasn't until almost 20 minutes later that our second appetizer was delivered, and the server tried to give it to another table!  I literally grabbed her arm to get my food!  The food was good, but we couldn't get past the poor service and lousy attitudes. We asked for our check and went elsewhere for the rest of our dinner.   I expected more from this establishment. I realize this place is new and has some kinks to work out, but a simple \"sorry for the wait\" and a friendlier attitude would have gone a long way.  I wish you guys all the best, hope your service improves.",

    "text": "I wanted to give this place two chances before I posted a review.  Upon my first try to Corkbuzz, the first complaint was the sign.  None of my friends could find the place.  I was told they are getting a new sign.  The inside of Corkbuzz is very attractive.  They have a beautiful private room that looks to seat around 20, with a long rectangular table and abstract art.  I would love to use it sometime.    Now to the important part...the food. One reason I wanted to wait is because I felt like maybe I ordered wrong the first time.  The waitress pushed how the braised octopus was the best thing on the menu.  She went as far to say there has never been anyone who did not like it. I am an adventurous eater, so I ordered it, of course.  Maybe octopus is just not my thing, but I did not enjoy it. I also ordered the cured salmon.  It was very fresh and looked pretty on the plate, but a bit plain. I tried the trout, nothing memorable, but not bad.   Fast forward to my second trip back.  Again, the waiter raved about the braised octopus! I decided to order the warm olives, which were well seasoned and interesting.   I also ordered the crab cake, which came on top of overflowing aioli with a scoop of tomato jam on top.  Both the aioli and jam were way too much for the crab cake.  I did think the both had a nice flavor, but you only need a smear of the jam, not a hefty scoop.  It was too sweet if I had eaten it, as served.  The crab cake itself was pretty good.  The greens beside the crab cake were delightful!  I tried the scallops over spaghetti squash and they were tasty.  I could not get enough of the spaghetti squash, it was perfection.  As far as the wine, I enjoyed it both times and found the list impressive.  Our servers both times seemed knowledgable about the wines.  The bottom line is that I will be back. There are improvements to be made with some of the dishes. And last but not least - stop pushing the braised octopus!  It really is not for everyone!",

A few minutes later, the charcuterie and two nice glasses showed up, but our other selection was curiously missing. I really like the wine list here and I was impressed with the place. Unfortunately, from there, it dropped off a cliff. We placed entree orders and then waited...and waited. After 45 min, we got an apology and some bread, along with a promise that our order was coming right up. Then we saw our order go right by us to another table.  Soon after our surprised server went to the back and came back with another apology and more charcuterie. It was another 30 minutes before we got our food, but by then our babysitting time was up. We barely ate, lightened our wallets by $100 and left with another apology and a certificate for a free glass of wine. The entire meal should have been comped. I think this place could be decent with better management (no excuse since they have multiple locations), but we were highly disappointed.",

I also felt compelled to call them today to let them know that their ads that seem to be playing very regularly on 107.9FM pronounced 'master sommelier' as 'master saw-mill-yeer'. Kind of a big deal when you're a wine bar with a sommelier at this level. :)",

Our server had her cell phone sticking out of her back pocket which was immediately a red flag. First I ordered a sommelier choice wine flight. After the server poured the wine I noticed some kind of prints on the inside of one of my glasses. I called her over and showed her. She said Oh that must be how someone picked up the glass. What? Isn't that in Waiting 101 Don't pick up glasses from the inside? So she took the glass away and brought a new glass which I'm sure had the same wine in it. Then our bread course came. Then not two minutes later our first appetizer course came. Ugh. She then came over and said I was hoping the way I rang that in would give you more time with the bread. Um did you not learn about firing courses either? I had the smoked pork loin which was good but I could've eaten a whole plate of the braised cremini mushrooms, onion chutney and pickled salad that came on the side. The coconut cake was fine but nothing that I couldn't get at Publix. Overall my experience was just okay but there are much better places to go some even right next door.",

    "text": "I went into my visit to Corkbuzz with high expectations and I was not disappointed! Although the restaurant is located a bit far from where I live, a few friends and I made the trip for a pre-Valentine's day dinner celebration on Saturday night. I had made a reservation in advance and we were seated immediately, despite arriving a few minutes late. The ambiance is great...the restaurant is smaller than I expected, but it feels cozy and inviting. It was perfect for a fun girls night out. The one thing that caught me off guard, and the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that they were only offering a pre fixed menu, so I wasn't able to sample a bunch of the things I had wanted to try from the normal menu. Normally, this wouldn't have bothered me as I know it was a \"holiday\" weekend with Valentine's day, but I checked the website in advance of my visit and saw no mention of the special menu.   My friend and I ended up splitting our food, and they were nice enough to separate everything out for us onto separate plates and didn't charge us anything extra. We started with the salad, which was great, but nothing too special. The nuts were a nice addition but there nothing else standout about it. Next, we had the crab cakes, which were excellent. Our main course was the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection and was actually quite a large portion, despite the fact my friend and I were splitting! My other friends had the wagyu beef, which also looked great and the portions were surprisingly large. The highlight of the meal was the dessert - and I am not a dessert person, which I think says a lot about how great it was. We had the chocolate cake and the ricotta donuts. The donuts are a MUST TRY! I was hesitant to take a bite at first, but once I did, I couldn't stop. They were served warm and there were more than enough to share with our whole table. Amazing! Our server even gave us each a complimentary taste of a dessert wine to go with our treats (it was a much larger pour than just a sip, but not quite a whole glass).  Overally, I had a great experience, just was a bit disappointed about not being able to try more things on the menu. I'll definitely be back!",
