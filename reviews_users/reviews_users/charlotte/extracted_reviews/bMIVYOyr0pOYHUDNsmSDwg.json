Burgers were fine, beers were fine. We really enjoyed the atmosphere.",

I guess it was supposed to come this way but to me and my 2 guests it was not good at all. I've honestly never had cold cheese dip with pretzels or anything else for that matter. I would say they saved themselves with the pimento cheese dip. That was amazing. The beer selection was also great. Service was good as well. I would definitely recommend this place, just not the pretzels.",

Turns out that was the WRONG idea because APPARENTLY a house vodka soda is the same price as any of the cocktails which is 13$. Very disappointed that I was not informed of this. Any bar I've ever been to the house cocktail is cheaper than the specialty drinks. I would've much rather had a specialty drink for 13$ than a house drink for the same price. Would've loved to be informed about the prices.",

Latte was cold when it came out which wasn't the best but not a big deal. But, I was the first to order and my food just never really came. The rest of my party had all eaten (one other person's order was wrong and asked the waitress to bring her the sausage she paid for and they never brought this out either after she asked). I spoke to the woman bringing out food and she knew I was missing my food, she just seemed to not get them to put me at the front of the line. I probably watched about 20 chicken biscuits come out as I waited. Eventually she just had my food come out to go, so I ate my now cold $14 chicken biscuit at home.",

I should have put in my 4+ star review when I first went in early August, but I guess I never got around to it.  I like the Hyde beers, so, I'm hoping other places start to carry them as well.  There is a lack of good food at our breweries in NC, I assume due to some weird ABC law.  Upon my first visit, I thought all that had changed.  2nd visit with just went with some burgers and pickles.  They weren't bad really, but no clue why they are charging so much.  I don't know.  Maybe it was just an off night.  I wish I could tell you more, but it just doesn't seem to live up the hype.",

    "text": "First impression of this place: WOAH what a gorgeous space! Industrial chic if that's a thing? Levers, pipes, exposed brick, reclaimed wood, hanging plants from the ceiling, and big windows! The restaurant area is one big room with a ton of natural light a relaxed feel, and a ton of seating at booth, table or, bar. There's also a whole patio area that I didn't get to explore, but it looked large as well.   Pro-tip: seating at the bar is first-come first-serve, so if there's a wait, stalk the bar. Works for me and my boo all the time.   We tried the Grouper Ceviche first which was great quality fish and a good sized portion, but the dish was a little plain for me as far as the flavor. Next, we had the Charred Shishito Peppers, which was really flavorful and yummy! Plenty to split between two people. My favorite was the Potato Croquettes which were fried, cheesy, and had an awesome tomato based sauce. All of this shared between two people plus a beer was actually enough to fill me up! If you are super hungry though, you might need a bit more.  Service was decent considering it was their second day open, but they are still working out a few kinks. One major plus is that all register's talk to each other, meaning if you start a tab inside, but then move outside, you can still add more to your tab from anywhere.",

I took a chance and wasn't disappointed! Suffolk Punch seems like a place where the staff really cares about the patrons and the food/beverages they serve. If It gets really crowded check out the warehouse behind the outdoor bar- it's a cool place to escape the heat or host an event.",

    "text": "Okay - huge disclaimer. We visited during the 2nd day of their soft opening, so they have a bit of growing pains to get over. That being said, I'm really excited for where Suffolk Punch is going to go.  The Lady and I went around 7:45ish and parking was a little tight, but we were able to find a spot in the side lot at the very back. We walked in from the door that's on the street...which is apparently not the front door. Weird. Would like to have seen signage for that. We walked down the hallway to the big expanse that is the main room. It's a gorgeous, open space with plenty of greenery hanging from the rafters, and a wrapping outdoor patio that's pretty incredible as well.  We found the hostess (again, at the complete opposite side of the building than we walked in from) and she told us it was going to be about a 30-45 minute wait. Woah. So we found 2 seats at the bar by the \"coffee cage\". It definitely did take some time for somebody to notice us, and there were no drink menus to be found (we had to ask for them twice during the duration of our stay) which was a bit of a frustration, but it didn't bring me down too much. We both ordered beers (Pro Tip: Order by #, it'll make the waiters lives a lot easier!), and then we went on to food. Everything came out fast, which was a giant plus! We got:  Grouper Ceviche: Light, citrisy, a bit spicy, and a great texture. I missed the aromatics, but enjoyed the radish. Might've been nice for a bit more crunch in there, but very good nonetheless. Charred Shishito Peppers: One of my favorite snacks. There's no way you can mess these up. Killed em in a matter of minutes. Potato Croquettes: Excellent! Dense, moist, flavorful, and fried. Perfect combo. Loved the tomato and gruyere was a *perfect* cheese choice! Charcuterie Plate: Big hits and a few qualms. 1) There was only 1 cheese on the board. Granted, one was peppered and one wasn't, but it wasn't very balanced. 2) Meats were cut at very different sizes. 3) Picked onions were sweet and delicious, whole grain mustard felt like it was kicked up with horseradish or wasabi, but both excellent. 4) I learned that duck pate is not my thing. And that's okay. I think it was done very well, but the taste is a bit more refined from what I was in the mood for. It was also strange that the duck fat was hard and on top. Didn't know if I was supposed to eat that or not...  Prices were totally acceptable for the portions that we got (2 drinks and 4 menu items totaled out to just under $50, and we walked away pleasantly full).   They need to get their roastery started up, as well as release their own beers, and do more with food fermentation. But, in any case, I'm actually really looking forward to seeing Suffolk Punch flourish. They got a good thing going. If nothing else, their 6:30am open time will be *perfect* for early morning coffee sessions :)",

HOWEVER... my friend and I had 1 drink and 2 small plates (nachos and chicken wings) and our bill was $41. That's a little ridiculous.  I think the most disappointing part was the staff. We walked to the hostess stand where 3 girls were standing. None acknowledged us. Finally, my friend asked a short haired, blonde girl if it was seat yourself (more as a \"why haven't you acknowledged us?\"). She seemed extremely confused.   After we were sat, it took a bit for someone to come to our table. When she did, she immediately told us that she wasn't sure if we were her table or not and if we weren't, someone different would be coming over. Ok?   I ordered a cocktail and she told me that because my cocktail didn't fall in line with what was on the cocktail menu, and it was \"that time of the day\" (aka 4pm on a Saturday), she didn't think the bartender could accommodate my request. It literally was the difference of grabbing one type of vodka vs. another. The even stranger thing was that there was a note on the menu stating that other cocktails besides what was listed on the cocktail menu could be made.   After all that, my drink was not good, at all.  When we ordered, it was clear that the waitress didn't know the menu. We asked for the nachos to come without onions and she responded that she wasn't sure if it came with onions and grabbed one our menus to check.",

Six hour pork belly- a friend ordered this and said it was good, but I didn't try it so you'll have to see for yourself! NC Bison Short rib- perfectly cooked, fell off the bone and was so tender.

    "text": "The great thing about The Suffolk Punch?  It's a coffeeshop: Offering Hyde Coffee on tap as early as 07:30am on weekdays (09:00am on weekends), as well as fresh and local Whisk & Wood pastries. Lucky you, morning commuters, on South End Rail Trail, this is your grab-and-go coffee spot from the walk-up patio coffee bar.  Loved the Nitro Coffee on-draft.   It's a taphouse: Offering rotating seasonal menu, staring at 11:30am everyday, with soy-, dairy- and gluten-free options. Weekend brunch is every Sat/Sun 10:00am - 03:00pm. Loved the meltingly tender NC Bison Short Rib.  It's a brewery: Offering 48 local taps (Hyde beers & local ones), wine, and cocktails. Try the Midlenhall Treasure cocktail if you know what's goof for you.   It's a Fermentation lab: Focusing on zymology- fermentation process used in beer.  I'm totally in love with the hip, yet inviting industrial dining room, and the forest vibe.   Four Solid Yelps.",

I love that you walk past the stills to get to the bar in the back which is unusual and the outside patio is the perfect \"downtown\" feeling spot especially when the train rolls though.    I like most of their own beers and the flights while restricted to their brand (understandable) they are well worth the try.",

The place was packed on a Saturday night, they had this great covered outdoor patio area with a bar outside.  Looked like a great place to hang out.  First off, I get it, it's busy on a Saturday night and I am by myself but it took a very long time to get service.  Definitely why I knocked down this place a star.  I decided to order the carchuittere plate and the fried green tomatoes.  I also had to get a beer, I got the local brewed one and loved it!  The carchurittere plate was very nice, I did wish it had one more soft cheese to it but the meat selection was great.  I am a sucker for fried green tomatoes and this one had a cornmeal crust to it so it was thick and hot off the fryer when I had it.  With the sauce it was a great little dish.    Definitely this place is a great place to hang out with a group of friends and grab some beers but also a good dinner spot.",

It was nice out so we sat on the patio.   They have a really large drink selection from their own beers, to other craft beer, to ciders, to cocktails. I had a cocktail and some ciders and they were all really good.   I ordered some small plates: the Pimiento cheese, the beet stained deviled eggs, and the tuna crudo. I enjoyed all of them, but they were a little expensive for the portion sizes you got.   My experience was pretty good until it started to get dark and cold outside and we tried to go inside. They wouldn't let us sit inside unless we ordered an entree. Given that we had already eaten and were trying to enjoy the brewery, this was very frustrating. I get that it's also a restaurant, but the fact that there is no way to enjoy the brewery without being outside is ridiculous.   We convinced someone to order an entree and the service inside want very good. The burger want cooked as ordered and the service was slow. The food is also pretty expensive.   I've avoided going here for happy hours since then because I don't want to be forced to sit outside if I don't want to eat. I think this is a pretty big problem they need to solve if they don't want to be a restaurant exclusively.",

Although the interior space seems a bit condensed the decor is beautiful and has a nice warm feeling.  The restaurant was probably 70% empty. My nine year old Foodie in training and I were ready to strap on the old feed bag, being super excited about the multifaceted concept here. The hostesses hesitated, talked amongst themselves and finally seated us at the end of a long high top that had another party already seated at it. It was kind of weird and uncomfortable when there were so many booths and tables empty and two of the occupied ones had two people only (were we being isolated/concentrated/ were we not worth a booth or proper table); even my kid picked up on it.  I ordered a Latte and soon found out the coffee bar was closed minutes before. I had no idea coffee service ended and swore there was a statement on the menu that referred to all selections being available until 6PM ( I could be wrong though). I said I would settle for just a plain old house cup of coffee. Nope. Surely I thought someone could make a cup of coffee (there were quite a few employees hanging around the inside of the kitchen doors eating and laughing). No biggie I thought, probably a shift change but this would have been an opportunity for someone to step up and provide stellar, gee it's only 10 past anyway, service. As a side note, for me, part of a fine dining experience (and the food here is excellent by the way) is having dessert and good coffee at the end; I personally don't want dessert without coffee. They have the high quality dessert (even though I was told they were out of Bananas Foster) and they have the high quality coffee but it's just not available together. Alright, so now that I've gone on and on with my old man diatribe/rant about no coffee, let's talk about the food.  The menu is chock full of some really nice selections - we ordered the small plates of Argentine Steak and The PEI Mussels. Both of them were artistically presented dishes. The rough chop chimichurri was good - the steak was nicely cooked and the blistered peppers were cooked perfectly. The broth on the mussels with the sun dried tomatoes and sliced fennel were a delicious combination I'd not had before. I just wish there had been more of them - there was however plenty of grilled bread for dipping.  So a mixed experience - the food = wonderful - but some of the weirdness I experienced dulled it a bit (I didn't even get to use my Yelp check in offer). Oh, and the beer they make is pretty dang tasty, especially their NE Style IPAs!",

There was an empty booth right behind us, but it took several minutes for them to seat us at that booth (which was already clean and available when we walked in the door). But it's all good.

Any question I asked she acted like I was stupid and would look away after like I was wasting her time. Ordering took longer than it needed to because of this and she did not inform us they only had one size of ice coffee until after she poured it. She broke off in the middle of our order to fill one of our coffees with such an attitude we just looked at each other and contemplated leaving right then. Finally I told her I would try the lavender latte but we were so irritated at that point that we didn't order any of the other things we wanted to try and left.  We will unfortunately not be back.",

    "text": "So upset I swear. So I had this place bookmarked on my yelp for a little while only to be disappointed when I finally came. So last week I came here on a Sunday to watch the game . When I pulled it up on yelp I seen it was a wait so I put myself on the wait list so by the time I arrived I could be seated . When I arrived I let the moody hostess know that I was on the waiting list so I showed her she said they would call my name when ready. Well after standing up for awhile I finally asked is it a wait to sit outside too or is it a separate wait list low n behold she was like oh no it's no wait list u can just go out there . Omg I swear if she would have just told me that from the beginning would have made things much easier ! So I'm sitting outside waiting for a waiter or waiter or waitress to come and assist me and when I noticed no one was coming to take my order I stopped one of the waiters and asked , so is anyone gonna take my order ?? He then proceeds to tell me oh u have to go to the tower and place the order yourself . Well thanks being that I never been here before I was not aware of that . The menu was all over the place so I just kept it simple n ordered a chicken biscuit . They gave me a number and someone shortly after brought it out and may I add this was the biggest chicken biscuit I had seen. While I'm sitting there figuring out how I'm going to eat this biscuit without making a huge mess I notice well I don't have any napkins.? Come to find out I had to go get those myself too. Nobody brought me any silverware or anything. Next thing you know these two guys with these two huge dogs came and set next to me on the bench's well I am terrified of dogs so that all in all made me uncomfortable. I guess this is a good spot for people that have dogs and want to go eat and enjoy while they bring their pets along but everyone is not fond of that so they should keep that in mind .Maybe have a separate section for the dogs perhaps?  I finally got fed up with having to keep stopping a waiter or waitress to ask about silverware napkins etc so I finally just asked can I have a to go box and i packed my biscuit up and I was out of there like Mario Andretti . I ended up throwing the biscuit away when I got home it wasn't even fit to eat because it fell over in the box and the sauce was all over everything . I will never step foot back in here if my life depended on it and the staff is not the nicest on top of it all !",

I would think they'd want to attract a decent lunch crowd, but not worth the train ride (or drive) from Uptown.  Great outdoor space.  I'll be back, but not as often as I'd like.",

    "text": "We have visited Suffolk Punch on a few occasions and I just think it is a-okay. I really think it hovers over 4 stars merely due to atmosphere but here is why it is a solid-3.  1. The outdoor area and indoor area is phenomenal. From the cozy booth seating to the warm communal tables, both exude True \"coolness.\" If you want to watch a game, great. If you want to have good conversation you're able to do so.  2.  Lots of great beer options if you're into that thing. But I can't drink it. And you only offer one, very mediocre, blanco tequila for me to drink. like, WOOF. You pride yourself on such quality beers AND a great menu, but ave a SOLID full bar, too. who is behind your cocktail menu? I opt for wine, which is also sub-par offerings. Just disappointing.  3. The food is inventive with amazing flavors. I really appreciate the gluten-friendly menu. I wish the cheese board was larger, and we'd be happy to pay more. For brunch, however, don't tell me that i can't get egg whites. If you have real eggs, you have egg whites. Any line-cook should be able to separate the yolk from the egg in about two seconds. The hash was AMAZING but I don't like egg yolks. J had the chicken and biscuit and it looked amazing. Bacon was great, too!  Haven't totally written this place off, but we don't always go out of our way to get here. Does get pretty packed on the weekends so arrive early and grab a spot.",

It is a great space for a big group, and affords ample room for mixing and mingling.   The food and drinks were great. What was disappointing was the server situation - our huge group had 1 server. You can imagine how insufficient that was for our group of 50+. I was there for over 2 hours and only got 1 drink the entire time. I tried hunting down the server multiple times to no avail.   Further, our food was set out when we arrived, but we ran out of plates, cups for water, napkins, and water. There was no server to be found to replenish our depleted items. We went inside to request additional waitstaff to assist us, more water, plates, etc. and the indoor staff were not helpful and said our server would be out soon.   When you have a big group coming, and you know this, you need to have ample waitstaff for the group. I would try this place again with a small group, but I am not interested in attending future group events here unless they remedy the server situation.",

The beet salad and the hamachi crudo were good. The bacon and tortillas were terrible, the bacon was rubbery, the fat was unrendered and gross. My wife got the burger with truffles. $30 for a burger that was not cooked to the temp that we wanted and included flavorless truffles and a very minor amount of them.  I did like the lime and the coconut drink though, 4-5 of them in it felt like I was at the beach! I'd recommend for drinks but def avoid for food.",

The service was great, efficient and checked in with us just enough, refilled waters without asking and was friendly but not annoying. We ordered a bunch of small plates to share with the table(I'm a sucker for small plates). We got the chorizo croquettes, the pimento cheese, the nachos with steak, pretzels with cheese dip, and the prosciutto platter. Everything was really tasty, but the standouts we're the onion jam and tomato jam on the prosciutto platter and the pimento cheese. So freaking good. Someone else at our table got the blt and it was the best blt she had ever tasted. So, while the food was great, the beer was amazing as well. They are doing really interesting things like using lavender in their saison, and rosemary in their Porter. So delicious. We liked it so much I took my brother in law and sister here two days later for coffee and drinks (did I mention they have a full coffee bar, and it's great too). I guess my only advice is to come here in the afternoon or on a day off when it isn't so busy and you'll have the best experience instead of a crowded Saturday night.",

The atmosphere is great, the food was decent and overall this place has potential.  I also think the Suffolk Punch/Hyde branding is a little confusing, wish they would just combine them into 1 but maybe that's just me. Will come back again because of the great location and atmosphere, hopefully will be able to update the review if the service is better!",

Food is farm to table so not many colorful options if you will, limited choices honestly. I got the burger because it was the most appealing thing on the menu, but it was underwhelming. No condiments are on the burger, and it had sour pickles and carrots of all things as garnishes. Even with ketchup there was not much flavor. The French fries were amazing! The drinks were decent, no frozen options, but I enjoyed the cocktails I tasted. I was not very impressed by the service, in fact I watched our bartender ask me and my two friends if we wanted to leave our tabs open (we all said yes), and then proceed to close each of them out as if she didn't know what an open tab meant. I'm not sure if she didn't feel we were good for the money or what, but she knew what she was doing, because the man who ordered a drink and food after us also indicated he wanted his tab open and I watched her put his card in the card box. Hmmm... I didn't appreciate that, actually it was offensive.   Patio is dog friendly and there are nice shades to keep the sun off. Oh and fresh mint in the potted plants! I may give it another try in hopes of better treatment by the staff.",

The ribs were delicious, with a wonderful African/Middle Eastern spice on top of smoky meat. The portion was plenty for 2 people to split - actually quite surprising for $10.  The sandwich was on point! Tender beef, thinly sliced/shaved with crispy onion strings and horseradish on a Kimmelweck bun with a cup of au jus to dip. The au jus could've used a little more seasoning (mainly salt), but nonetheless, the sandwich as a whole was wonderful. The French fries were noticeably fresh cut and perfectly seasoned. Probably some of the best fries I've had in Charlotte.  I'm curious about the English Muffin Burger, so I'll be back for sure! They also have a coffee shop, and this place is part of Hyde Brewery, though I didn't try the coffee or beer.",

The decor is great, their beers were solid, good selection of other local breweries and local craft distilleries used for cocktails.  Great concept and something that Charlotte is currently lacking.  But... Full disclosure,  I am a smoker.  A nasty habit, I know.  I went outside to an empty patio to drink and light up.  No complaints for almost an hour.  A manager comes up and mentions that we can't smoke on the back patio, but are welcome to move to the side patio to smoke.  All is good and we happily oblige.  A few minutes pass and a waitress tells us we can't smoke there either.  We mention that we were told to move there by a manager.  She tells us that she doesn't believe us and to put our cigarettes out.  We comply again.  A different manager comes out and asks the waitress if we are causing problems.  At no point were we rude, nor did we not do as we were asked.  I doubt that you will be successful if this is how you treat your customers.",

In browsing through Yelp pictures, there were a few things that caught my eye on the menu(s) and brought me in for lunch today (Ceviche, Pretzel and beer cheese and Suffolk Punch Burger) however the menu pics I saw were old and none of the above was on today's menu.  With that said, I was surprised to only receive a brunch menu at 12:30p and it wasn't until after ordering (something I wasn't really interested in) that on the website it stated \"full menu available daily\".  I wish my server had mentioned that the full menu was available but nevertheless I ate what I ordered and it was good.  I also wish I could've sampled a few beers before locking in on one or maybe there were flight options I was unaware of.  Next time I will go in with drinks on my mind and not necessarily food.  Maybe I should have said I was a first timer here and asked some questions. Next time...",

I could've had tons more because it was just that good.  This is how I wish every drink could be: perfect.  If you like spicy, I encourage you to try it.  Ignore the price and get it.  It was amazing.  I also tried the Hyde lavender saison.  I didn't care much for it, because all lavender tastes like soap to me.  It is, however, very unique.  The chicken biscuit with scrambled eggs and gravy was beautiful and very delicious.  I'd love to try some different menu items in the future.",

Everyone was in a great mood - perhaps it was the wonderful weather - but we had exceptional service  Some really cool things about this restaurant/brewery - they have great local beer prices for their Sunday brunch. We're talking $4 or less for a local beer, that's great in my opinion.  I ordered the chilaquiles- they were phenomenal. My friends ordered the French roast and the basic breakfast. No matter what the order - the food was cooked at a great temp, and it tasted fantastic. (Although I should point out that everyone agreed mine was the best, so order the chilaquiles if you can).  All in all - no complaints. The venue was clean - parking was easy to get. The neighborhood is walkable but a good way from downtown so would recommend driving. The bar is large so you could always get a seat there if there wasn't seating too!",

    "text": "I went to brunch here on a Sunday and had a great experience! We sat ourselves outside. Out here you receive service by walking up to the outdoor bar. You don't have a server. At the bar you can get a menu, order drinks, and order food. We had the chicken biscuit, deviled eggs, and mimosas. All of which were so yummy. I think the only problem we had was when we asked for a coffee and tea menu, they told us we would have to go inside for that. So instead, we just didn't order any. That experience was 5 start but I'm keeping it at 4 for my past experiences.  Old review: The place overall has great decor and feel but the drinks are too expensive and the service has been rude or slow. I have been twice. The first time was the day after the soft opening and they were out of everything besides tea and coffee. I totally understood. But the only reason I knew this was because my friends who were already there told me. We were one of 3 groups there and when I walked in no one greeted me. I had no idea how the place worked. After waiting at our table for many minutes I walked up to the bar and tried ordering a tea. Long story the girl working was snotty and unhelpful. They also didn't have sugar for tea. The second time I went was a Saturday evening for drinks. After looking over the cocktail menu and seeing drinks ran about $13 or $10 for wines, my friend and I ordered well vodka sodas. They were fine. But upon receiving the bill they cost $28.50. Which would mean they were more expensive than the specialty cocktails. We asked the bartender and he shortly told us this is how it works there and all drinks are $13. So a house vodka with club soda costs the same as a gin special with a lemon twist, charred something or other, and some fancy flavor. I have never been to a place where the house wells are the same prices as specialty drinks and more expensive than nice wines. The bartender also seemed more busy with friends than with speaking to us. I voted a 3 because I have yet to try their food and love the inside.  A few weeks later we went back to try the food. The service was friendly but the food was undercooked and nothing to go back for. It was also odd that there was no option to tip on a gift card. We asked if she could charge us partially on our credit card so we could leave a tip and that was also not possible. We felt awful leaving without tipping but had no cash. So instead we left our gift card which had money left.",

Made myself eat it since it was $12 but not impressed!

They griddle the bun and burger in butter so if your lactose intolerant like me you just want to ask them to skip that.  The sourdough bread is a little heavy but the pickles are awesome.  Didn't care for the bacon jam, too much onion.  Fries are great!  The chips are a little over-done for my taste but I liked the mesquite smoked flavor.  Bathrooms are really nice!

Back to the burger, what's in?... Well, no meat, that's all I got for ya. I didn't ask because I was wwwaaayyy too busy shoving it my face. I was on the clock so I couldn't par take of the many, many taps they have they most of which is their own brews from thirty feet away. As they are a brewery, which you can reserve a space and have dinner in the brewery; which they dim the lights down to create and amazing atmosphere. Lighting is key in this place with it's Steam Punk style decor it sets the mood for a chill, relaxing time and super convenient to the Light Rail.

I walked into their nearly empty restaurant to order breakfast. The four staff members stared at me like I was an alien. Finally, one of them was like oh it's seat yourself.  There was no sign. So we begin to get a seat and then he's like oh well you have to order at the counter. #okay so we go over to the counter and they have literally four options for breakfast. Damn. That's disappointing. I ask for a sandwich without bacon and you would have thought I had asked for the world on a silver platter. That was just a huge request for them to handle. So I walked out.

Check out daily drink deals to aid your beverage selection, as this menu has a plethora of options including local beers, crafted cocktails, classic well drinks and wines.   Recommendations:  Breakfast (weekdays)- mushroom toast, avoacado toast Brunch (sat+sun)- vegetable hash, egg sammy  Lunch- farro salad, Reuben sammy  Dinner- veggie or regular burger, mussels small plate   Good for groups of any number or age. Relaxed ambiance during the day, but a great place to meet up socially later in the evening, as well. The area is spacious, so rarely too noisy!

The interior and patio are really cool and nicely decorated. It's modern farmhouse/coffeehouse vibe and the patio backs up to the lightrail greenway trail.   The ordering concept here is a little different where you order your coffee inside at the coffee bar and then order your food at a separate bar. It's order at the counter and they bring your food to your number/table. I really wanted one of the kids' meals but they said the chef would refuse. Some places are cool about that, but how does the chef know I'm not a kid? Is he/she going to come out and check to make sure? Weird. Anyway, I paid the extra $9 to get the adult breakfast of the same breakfast. My eggs were overcooked and pretty flavorless.   Everyone else enjoyed their breakfasts, like the sandwich and hash scramble. The coffee was also different, but good. I wouldn't rush back here, but it was okay to try out.",

You do the math and bring a friend.  Parking here was a bit tricky so walk or bike if you are in the neighborhood. I'm looking forward to another visit and trying more of their menu. However, the three apps I sampled were a little underwhelming.  The charcuterie plate is just that, with the only cheese being a crumbled blue - I wish that was noted on the menu. The spicy mustard on the plate is terrific. If you also order the pimento cheese app (there's your cheese!) they provide the same crostini for  dipping as is on the charcuterie  plate.  Come for the beautiful decor, comfortable chairs and kind service.",

The ambiance and decor are very nice and trendy. We only went here to order drinks and the amount and variety of beers were very overwhelming. TIP: if you have never been here before, you order your beer by the number, not the name of the beer (which goes past 25).   The bartender service was horrendous though. I am reasonable and know that I am not going to get served right away, especially with the number of people that were there. However, I had to wait about 15 minutes standing right behind the bar to finally get someone's attention and order a beer.   Also, the bar area is right next to where people are sitting for dinner so it is very crowded in such a tight space. We were so close to one table that I felt like I was having dinner with them (which, if I were there to have dinner, I would have been annoyed by all of the people right next to me). Once we finally did get beers there is plenty of space down towards the back hallway area.   My biggest cons with Suffolk Punch would be with the inside layout as stated before. There is plenty of room outside (including outdoor games). I would like to give this place a try for food as the dishes did look delicious and when the weather is nice. However, if the weather is NOT GOOD or it is during the winter time where you do not want to go outside, I would not recommend this place as the inside is just too tiny to accommodate everyone in a comfortable space.",

    "text": "First of all the parking is non-existent, so there's that... my party of 12 had to park blocks away and one person just said forget it, parked at my house a mile away and we ubered back to the restaurant (keep reading). All of this, to not be seated or served (keep reading). A friend made a reservation for my birthday 2 weeks in advance. She arrived early to made sure she would greet all arriving guests. The host said she saw the reservation and we would be seated shortly (keep reading). Only to be told 10 mins later, they didn't have our reservation and we could wait 30-45 mins to see if they would be able to seat us.... huh? WOW. What in the world? The \"asst manager PATRICK\" kept apologizing, but was not being helpful at all. Telling a group of 12 to wait up to 45 mins to be seated (mind you we had already been waiting about 30 mins) when we had a reservation from weeks before. This was my first time there, and LAST. It was very frustrating to see open tables that could accommodate us, however we were not made a priority at all. Other parties that had not arrived were put ahead of our needs, even though we were already there and waiting AND DID I MENTION WE HAD RESERVATIONS. I would love a formal apology from a representative of this establishment. It was a joint birthday celebration that was tarnished with unprofessionalism and mass confusion. I am big on customer service so for nothing to be offered for our inconvenience at the time of incident really puts a bad taste in my mouth FOREVER. If they don't get it together, they wont last - there are a million places to go in Charlotte and if your service isn't top notch, you will end up like all the other restaurants that have opened and closed in less than 3 years, GONE.  P.S. We ended up at Napa on Providence - they were wonderful and accommodating, go there for a quiet quaint brunch!  Sincerely... I will never be a customer, Alyssa W.",

Very tastefully decorated. They have a long bar with lots of different beers including other breweries aside from theirs. They also have a craft coffee bar separate from their alcohol bar. But you can still order from your waiter off the menu.   They are located right off the light rail so just a very quick walk from New Bern station. They have a solid outdoor patio area that is covered and heated throughout the year depending on the weather. But no pets are allowed in the tent so be ready for that!   The wait staff are friendly but they definitely can get busy! It's centrally located around a lot of other cool places down in South Charlotte too!",

    "text": "I am not quite sure what to think of this place yet, do not get me wrong, the food was delicious. They offer an eclectic menu, from Asian to traditional Southern.  Ok here is why i'm a bit confused: It's a brewery which is clear, when you enter. I feel you enter in the back, because you have to go down this long \"hallway\" to reach the hostess station. You can see the dining area off to the side and a very long wrap-around bar in the center with the brewery displayed on the back of it. The bar is so large and feels a bit overwhelming that it comes off that the dining area was just an after thought. Like \"oh people drink here...maybe we should serve food\" aaaaaaaaaaaand it's also a coffee bar. So yeah, I feel this place is trying to be so many things, that I can't really categorize it, perhaps that's the point. Maybe I have this opinion, because we came here during lunch and perhaps has a different feel during the happy-hour, night-time crowd.  Went here with a party of 3, so we got to order a lot of stuff - The Suffolk Punch Burger - I really liked this. Whole grain mustard is my fave and shaved onions and the sourdough roll are just the cherries on top. Definitely order this, if you are unsure and want to order something solid. - Grilled Chicken Sandwich - the BF was not quite a fan, he ordered it and his opinion was more of a \"meh\", chicken tasted bland and was more of a \"pulled\" chicken style. (He regretted his order and wished he  had gotten the burger too LOL) - Crispy Korean Rock Shrimp - we both liked this, the glaze paired really well with the aioli. - Frenched Wings - red glazed wings were also good.  As you can see their menu is eclectic and maybe that is their niche a little taste of everything with your coffee or brew.  Drinks, they obviously have coffee, brews, but no fountain soft-drinks. Originally asked for a Dr. Pepper, but the server apologized that they do not have a full bar. They do have Coke, but it's the glass bottled versions - no refills!  Reason I gave deductions is that parking is horrible there and because they do not have soft drink fountain. For being a restaurant and having this huge bar, they should have fountain drinks. Especially being open for lunch, brunch and dinner / happy hour.  Will I come back, of course - that Suffolk Punch Burger was bomb! but i'd probably carpool.",

It was National Burger day so they had $9 specials for a burger and fries. I feel like getting a burger/sandwich so I ended up going with the Wagyu sandwich.  The Wagyu had shaved beef with some flash fried onion rings and a horseradish sauce which was deluctant.  For beer I sat around with my friend just tasting what beer made sense with our food choices. I went for one of the coffee stouts, not sure the name but the bartender will sure be happy to help and then went for Introduce the Juice, a New England IPA from Hyde brewing.  We ordered the drinks and food at the bar, took the drinks outside and then we had a number where the food would be delivered right to us, except my friend who ordered the nachos and got them at the bar immediately before we ever ordered our brews; talk about fast.  This was a great spot to hang out and unfortunately the coffee bar was closed, but hopefully next time I'll get to try some of their craft coffees.",

I have loved it ever since from the bartenders/wait staff to the decor and food (not the brunch I had, but I'll get to it).   SP/HB has an amazing beer special every Thursday and Sunday, ALL DAY, that has all of THEIR awesome craft beers $3; which includes about 34 different choices and counting.   I really just wanted to inform everyone on my brunch experience I had with the food. This is why I took off one star. I ordered the huevo rancheros for $13 and was highly disappointed for the following reasons:  1) It took them forever to bring it out.  2) The temperature on the food, @ best, was luke-warm to cool.  3) It wasn't huevo rancheros (no crispy anything) 4) It was an extremely small portion (see photo) and I was still hungry .   All in all, I would definitely recommend going here but don't get the Huevo rancheros. You will be highly disappointed. Instead, get the fried chicken biscuit or something other then the aforementioned item.",

They brew their own beer here so you can guzzle down some Charlotte made brews while eating good food instead of your typical bar food.  My go-to brunch items: - Shrimp N Grits: My favorite in Charlotte, hands down. This dish is perfectly savory and spicy, with NC shrimp, chorizo, okra, peppers, Anson Mills grits, scallions, and creole sauce. It's got a kick that doesn't leave it bland and boring like some other places.  - Chicken and Biscuit: if you're hungry, this massive breakfast sandwich is sure to fill you up! It's a scratch made biscuit with scrambled eggs, fried chicken, and peppercorn-chive gravy poured on top. - Buckwheat and Quail: this dish is a popular one! These wonderful buckwheat johnncakes are topped with flash fried Georgia quail and whipped butter, with a smearing of house made blueberry syrup. I love the flavor combination with the quail and blueberries.  My seasonal drink: a creation they make in the winter time -- Cottonheaded Ninnymuggins, which is whiskey, coffee, and house made peppermint syrup topped with marshmallows... to DIE for!  The atmosphere here is really cool! You can sit at the bar and enjoy a short visit, or stay longer at a high top to get some work done or in a booth/at a real table to really indulge. There's also a great patio area for enjoying the nice weather, with a handful of large TVs, an awning, and a outside bar.",

Probably 4 out of 5 dishes we would have tried were unavailable. The food and cocktails that we did have were good.   The service - although almost two hours from start to finish - seemed as if our window was rushed each time the server or food runner visited the table. Any question we had seemed to come with a labored and hasty response in answering.   I would try again, but I would call ahead and make sure you're getting the menu you're signing up for with no limitations. I also hope our customer service was a fluke.",

It has a very relaxed atmosphere to it, sometimes you can catch live music on Friday or Saturday nights. They've got $3 local beers Thursday and Sunday's so that's pretty hard to beat as well, and to top it off they've got great food, highly recommend the buffalo shrimp and the pork wings!",

This time the bathrooms were a disaster and very unkempt. Toilet paper all over the place, the trash can overflowing with paper towels. Clearly they are not checked on all that often. We have been wanting to try their food and will most likely go one more time to give it a try but unfortunately we have no desire to come back just to drink. We do like the ambiance of the place.",

I got there early on a Saturday and did the wait-list app on Yelp and it was very off... Said 5-15 wait and it was more like 30 minutes. The host & hostess were super nice and I didn't mind waiting. Our server was very sweet and fast especially for how busy they were. It was only 7:30pm and they were slammed.  The grilled chicken sandwich seemed slightly undercooked and was not great. The pimento cheese app was delicious though! My friend enjoyed her mussels.  All in all I'd pop back in here but probably for drinks and I'd take Uber or light rail. The parking was horrible ... Only one tiny lot and barely any street parking bc of Triple C across the street.",

If you don't try anything else here and like it a little spicy...this is the drink for you!   I also shared the chicken and egg biscuit with sausage crazy. It was very tasty as well.

They have a nice lively atmosphere inside and an extensive drink menu, although I'd say their beer and cocktails are overpriced. I guess that's the trade off of it being a convenient location to where a lot of people live.",

    "text": "Suffolk Punch is using deceptive wait-list management. They have signed up with the NoWait app service which is used by good handful restaurants in Charlotte to manage wait-lists. It showed \"no-wait\".  But, Suffolk Punch is not updating their queue in it, so that it looks like they are always able to handle traffic and customers without wait. However, when you arrive at the restaurant, the nonchalant answer is, \"Oh yeah, we know about that, but it is 1.5 hours wait.\" And, then, blame the \"algorithm\" for their mistake of proper management and usage of the list.  This drives additional traffic to their restaurant without any hope of serving them. This is very deceptive. No idea how their food is, however, I will not return to any restaurant that tries to trick me into visiting.",

    "text": "Went to Suffolk on Sunday to eat brunch and my friend brought her dog inside the outside \"beergarden\" and there were NUMEROUS dogs in there. There were even dogs on the tables....and no one said a thing. I go back with my dog on Friday and go to the outside \"beergarden\" yet again to watch the UNC game. We asked the host if dogs were allowed and she said yes. We got our drinks, ordered food and hungout at the table. My dog was doing nothing wrong, just sitting there not bothering anyone and a worker comes up and says that dogs arent allowed and he walked away. Because of my previous experience where dogs were allowed, we stayed. The man came back, when we had our food and told us if we didnt go outside that we would be kicked out. He didn't even offer to move our food outside. I asked him how merely a few days ago dogs were allowed inside and tonight mine wasn't and he said \"listen, my boss told me to tell you, i'm just doing my job.\" K. So my boyfriend quickly finishes his food and takes our dog outside. I close out our tab (couldn't imagine spending another dollar at this place) and the dude behind the bar asks how everything was and i said good, minus the fact a few days ago dogs were allowed in here and now i'm being told mine isn't. The only response this guy can think of is, \"Oh its subjective. It really just depends on the day. But hey, we're taking the covering off on 4/8 so come back with your dog then....no thanks. The inconsistency is ridiculous and the fact no one knew WHY my dog wasn't allowed is absurd.",

    "text": "After driving around for 15 minutes trying to find parking (without parking blocks away), I attended what was supposed to a joint birthday brunch for two friends on Sunday, October 14th.  My friend who made the reservation was there 20 minutes before the reservation time to be sure everything was secure, which was confirmed by the hostess and to greet the rest of the guest as they arrived.  All guest were there promptly by the reservation time of 12pm; about 10-15 minutes later the manager on staff that day came over and advised that they did not have the reservation, though he was reading the exact reservation details from the iPad he had in hand. He then proceeded to say that they will not seat us and was giving our table to another group who's party wasn't even there yet.  My friend explained that these reservations were made two weeks ago and confirmed three days prior as to the number of guest and all details were confirmed. The manager kept saying he doesn't know what happened to the reservation and said we would have to wait an additional 30-45 mins before a table would be available after we had already been waiting about 30 mins, Mind you a high top table had a reservation sign on it with my friends name, so no one would be seated there. The manager told her that was for someone else who supposedly had the same name. At that point we decided to leave and go elsewhere. The customer service was very disappointing as there was no effort to make accommodations for our party after the staff messed up on their side.",

My mom, sister and I visited this place this past Saturday around 1 in the afternoon. We sat outside on their back patio area and the weather was absolutely gorgeous. We sat ourselves then went up to the counter and ordered a carafe for mimosas and our food. The bartenders in and outdoors were friendly and made great drinks. I believe outside you could only get bloody marys and mimosas but inside is where I ordered our second round of drinks. My long island ice tea was average, my sister loved her cucumber drink and my mom enjoyed her bloody mary. The food came out speedy and piping hot! I had shrimp and grits which were perfectly seasoned. The atmosphere is what I love most about this place. Its honestly one of those places you just have to try out for yourself because my description won't do it justice. I also like the crowd. Very laid back, friendly, and it was somewhat diverse. Its located in the beautiful and constantly developing south end area of Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and check this place out on an early Saturday afternoon. You'll thank me later.",

    "text": "ahhh... so much potential!!!  If I had to rate The Suffolk punch purely on decor and ambiance, I'd give it a whole 5 star rating. Unfortunately, there's so much more to consider. The food was average at best, the service was really quite terrible (the drinks took foreverrrrr to get to us, some things never made it to us at all, our server kept disappearing for long periods of time) The first time we went there in the morning for a cup of coffee, we were so excited because 1) the coffee was awesome 2) the decor was even more awesome. We couldn't wait for them to be open for dinner. and when they were, we decided to check it out with some friends. We ordered a lot of food, almost everything on the menu - from the potato croquettes to the foie gras popcorn, from the beet salad to the pickles, the punch burger to the market fresh fish - and while non of the food was terrible, none of it was memorable either. The overall experience however was a memorable one because it was expensive and underwhelming.  The drinks that did make it to our table were good, but when you have to wait 20 minutes for a drink, they ought to be amazing - either the drink menu needs to be simplified, or the bar service upped. There's tremendous unrealized potential here... perhaps things will improve with time?",

    "text": "Came in on a Saturday evening around 5pm. It was the day of the Kentucky Derby so things were very busy. We put our name down at 5:26pm for a party of 8 to be seated inside for dinner. The hostess gave us an estimated time of 15-20 minutes. Suffolk has a systems where they text you and you can view your place in line.. after about 15 minutes we were at the top of the waitlist and were to be seated next. Around 6pm (30 minutes after we put our name down) we see two tables open, one with 7 chairs and one with 6. We assume we will be seated soon so we get excited.. until a 7 top that was clearly behind us on the waitlist grabs the table and asks the hostess if that was their table and if they can sit there. The hostess says yes and they get seated before us although we were at the top of the waitlist for awhile now. We saw this, went over to the hostess and asked what happened and how much longer the wait was. The hostess says that since our party was 8 they had no space for us... although they literally could have grabbed ONE chair and put it at that table. She then decided to tell us that she had \"no idea anymore\" when we were going to be seated. It went from 15-20 minutes to \"no idea.\" We totally understood that the place was busy and people were sitting at their tables longer than expected to watch the race. However, seating the 7 top before us was absolutely ridiculous. The hostess then decides to seat a 6 top at the other empty table claiming that they did not have enough chairs for us. There were clearly a few chairs around the restaurant that were not in use.. they were just being lazy at that point. In the end, we ended up wait 1.5 hours!!! Until we finally asked the hostess again what her honest opinion was on the wait and she told us that if it were her, she would leave and find another place. As soon as we all leave and get in our ubers, we get a text at 7:01 pm that our table was ready. What a horrible first experience for all of us. Management, please train your staff to properly seat tables. Just because a group sits down and asks if they can sit there doesn't mean you let them. You have a wait list for a reason and people should not be allowed to cut others. Guests understand that you are busy and are willing to wait longer on a busy day but failing to properly seat people in order is unacceptable.",

My family and I were evaluating this location for a rehearsal dinner event and had notified one of the managers that we would be coming in.  After waiting around for a while we were told that there were no tables big enough for our group of 7 and that we would have to wait for some tables to clear out.  After an hour and 15 minutes we inquired again about a table and were told that there are only booths that would not be large enough for our party.  We inspected for ourselves and discovered that the booths were plenty big and we could have likely been seated at least a half hour earlier.   While one of the managers did start our night off with a complimentary plate of pimento cheese, this nice gesture was soon overshadowed by an impatient waitress.  As we were ordering the waitress was bold enough to tell a member of our party that \"if she did not hurry up her order she would have to leave for another table.\"   Hoping that the food would make the wait worthwhile we were largely disappointed.  The green tomatoes and pork belly were both bland as was the shaved beef sandwich.  The best dish we were served was the short rib and that was still overly salty and does not stack up to other barbecue options available in Charlotte.   Overall this was a very poor experience and if you are looking for a brewery experience with some good food, don't waste your time on Suffolk Punch.",

Initially I went there for dinner, and was really impressed with their extensive beer list. The food was always good quality, fresh, and changed often to include seasonal ingredients. After a while I discovered they also serve coffee here during the day, and the baristas were all great and very friendly. Service was a bit varied - a couple of times I felt a bit neglected and had to wait quite a while to order or get my bill, but most of my visits I was looked after by one of the regular staff who would take excellent care of me, I was impressed by how knowledgeable they were about the beers, and they'd do nice things like recommend other cool places to check out in Charlotte.",

Decided to try a weekday night, since weekends seem to always be packed.  Was able to grab a booth and Tuesdays is half price off bottles of wine.  Ended up getting a Pinot Noir which was excellent.  Our server, Ashley, was really nice.  I got there much earlier than my friend, but she still came over and made sure I was taken care of - also made sure to pour my friend's glass so the wine could breathe.  It's all about the details.  We ordered the korean rock shrimp, pimento cheese/chips, and the pork belly and shared all the plates.  Everything was delicious and we even \"went all out\" and got the seasonal cheesecake that had a pumpkin chutney on top of it.  I ended up getting a double IPA (21 Hands) and it was decent... I was surprised to see a lot of variety in the Hyde beers for being a young brewery.  Overall a great dining experience.  The dining room is dim and relaxed, I'm sure it's a different story when there are a lot of people in here.  Their outdoor space (now with a winter tent and heaters) is a great space since it backs up to the light rail trail and New Bern Lynx Station.  I do agree with some of the previous reviews where parking is left to be desired, but with a light rail option, super walkable for Southend residents, this place is sure to stick around for a while.",

Location: 4/5 - right off the New Bern light rail. There's usually scooters parked outside too! Close to Triple C and Lenny Boy if you're looking to brewery hop.  Food: 4/5 - I've had a couple sandwiches before including the breakfast egg and sausage biscuit. Reasonable price point at brunch around $10-15 without a drink.  Beer: 3/5 - personally I'm not a huge fan but they do offer a wide selection.  Service: very spotty. Most recent experience, 2/5. Went on a Saturday around 11:45 am. Ordered outside right when we got there. It was busy so I was anticipating a wait for food. I received my food about 30 mins after ordering (reasonable based on the crowd). However, my friend didn't receive hers for an hour after I did. She went up several times to ask about her food and they kept saying the kitchen is backed up. I understand things happen but 1.5 hours to wait was slightly ridiculous. Luckily, the manager was very kind and offered her a gift card for the trouble.",

They didn't have soy milk, only oat milk. I was a little disappointed because we were mainly there for Sunday brunch and it didn't hold up to my expectations. I might give it another go and come back here just for drinks and small plates. But I definitely won't come for their mains.",

They've also got an outside bar so you don't have to go back and forth should you chose to eat outside. They've got all kinds of incredibly good deals and the one I got to enjoy in this last visit was $3 in house beers. They have a very wide selection of Suffolk Punch beers so that gives you plenty to choose from and for a great price. Both times that I've had food here as well it's been pretty good. They give very good shareable sized portions and the quality of the food is great. This last time we got to try the chorizo nachos and all the toppings on it make it pretty filling but it's not too much where you'll feel way too stuffed afterward. We also got the frenched wings that have a really tasty sweet sauce and they're so tiny it's easy to eat a lot of em before you know it! And overall our drinks were good and well worth it. Definitely would come back here for another laid back afternoon.",

Now that I've moved to the area, I thought it would be a good place to check out with a friend visiting from out of town.   We went around 11:30 on a Sunday and were told there was a 30 min wait. No biggie. We sat at a couch by the coffee bar and got coffee and were seated in about 20ish minutes.   Here's my breakdown:  Coffee Bar: 10/10. I got an iced vanilla latte with oat milk and it was great. The coffee bar area is also just really cute.   Food: 5.5/10. The brunch menu was very limited. I got the chicken and biscuit. My food was served lukewarm like it had been ready for maybe 15 minutes but didn't make it to me at that point. It was okay I guess. Maybe my expectations were just too big. My friend got the same thing plus grits and both his food items were the same temp.   Service: 5/10. Our waitress didn't pay a lot of attention to us. Took her about 20 minutes to bring my friend an unsweet tea. Didn't really check on us.   Location: 10/10. It's on the rail trail and is within walking distance of lots of other cool Charlotte spots. Just be aware that parking is a battle in that area.   Ambience: 10/10. Love the decor and the music they were playing and the overall feel.   Ultimately, the service and food just didn't deliver based on my expectations. It's a place I would maybe go if it was picked by a group of friends, but I wouldn't pick it myself.",

Upon enter, I really love the look and the vibe of the place with lots of greenery. They weren't busy so we were able to be seated immediately. The service was good since we sat on the inside instead of doing the outside self serve.   They have some interning cocktails, coffee, and mixes between the two but I didn't try any this time around. We ordered the chicken n biscuit and the breakfast burrito. Now aesthetically, the chicken biscuit was great. It's literally huge! Unfortunately, it really didn't have much flavor which was a bit disappointing. The breakfast burrito also could have used a hit of more seasoning. They weren't terrible, it's just for a $14 biscuit I expect it to be great. All in all an average experience.",

We probably wouldn't have got inside anyways but we were told the outside area was the best bet. We managed to fit about 13 of us at one of the large tables but it was a little awkward.  We had the following: some mimosas, the chicken biscuit, hash brown casserole, and the apple cider bacon. Oh and half of a grapefruit elderflower spritz which was really yum. None of the food wowed me but none of it was bad either. Of the three food items the hash brown thing was the best.   The last sort of annoying thing was they messed up the bill. We had kept a tab open and when the hubby closed it they forget to add the food and when he pointed it out the guy was like whatever basically, then later came back with the full bill and reran our card. I never did get confirmation they cancelled the first charge soooo yea.  Also parking was extremely annoying but I guess it's kinda nice that the lightrail is right there.",

She made it seem like our presence was bothering her. She did not even try to hold a conversation with us like she did with the previous customers  before us. While we ordered she seem bothered  and she was definitely rude. The food was okay the chicken sandwich had some tasty bacon on it. The chicken biscuit was okay also. I just can't get over the fact of how poor the service was. I can't even begin to explain how I felt, I hope no one has to ever feel unwelcome & uncomfortable because that's how I felt.

Two stars for the aforementioned location, satisfactory service and dirty chai. However, I came for coffee AND food. Here is a tip, don't advertise breakfast in your \"culinary cafe\" and put out a breakfast menu if you don't serve breakfast. When I asked about the food menu this morning, the answer was, \"we aren't very busy for breakfast so we we don't have one\". She then said we may have a small quiche with greens, but when she checked, you did not.",

    "text": "And I thought service in Miami, FL was the worst I had ever had. I stand corrected...  While visiting NC, my good friend decided to check out this place that she had heard nothing but good things about. Needless to say I was excited because I rarely get to have brunch.  We arrived and it had started to rain so we ran inside. My friend had put us on the waitlist through the app and when we arrived were told it would still be about 15-20 minutes. In my book, this was a good sign considering how packed the place was. We asked if it was possible to sit at the bar and the hostess said of course and the brunch menu would be available there as well.   We sat down and waited for a little over 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by the two bartenders working that section of the bar, and by that I mean the one with the evil mustache completely ignored us and the other bartender greeted us only because he asked the people next to us if they were ok. We decided to let it slide because they were slammed.  We got our menus and ordered my friend ordered instantly cause she was ravenous (she ordered the shrimp and grits). I on the other hand wasn't ready and just ordered a biscuits and gravy to hold me off till I was ready to order, we also ordered our drinks at the same time. The drinks came out quick and I gave my order right then and there so my food would arrive a little after my friends.  The biscuits and gravy ended up coming out at the same time as the shrimp and grits about 10 minutes later. We didn't mind and started to eat instantly, well at least we attempted to when we discovered we had no silverware. No biggie, except we again struggled to get someone's attention. We finally got his attention, again, while he took care of the people next to us. This was the last time we saw the bartender, and by this I mean we can clearly see him working along with his partner, who again, hasn't even looked our way, but no service was provided after that, to us at least. They literally served everyone around us.  Did I mention that my food didn't show up for over 40 minutes? I had ordered huevos rancheros. At first, just cause of my background, I let it go... but after describing what I went through ^^^ you can see why I started to get mad. My friend thought he forgot, and I thought he just didn't put it in because he didn't care based on the service we were receiving. At this point, it was time to close out our tab for the items we had received and get out of this place. It took a while to get someone's attention again but my friend got as mad as I was and went directly to the hostess and requested a manager.  When she got back, FINALLY, after giving up hope, received my food. Except, the food looked like dog food, and it was ice cold. I don't mean that in an exaggerated manner either, it was literally cold, almost like it was sitting in the walk in. The manager came by minutes later and we explained what was going on. He apologized profusely and for obvious reasons comp'd my meal along with the biscuits and gravy. Much appreciated but the damage had been done already.   The manager dropped the tab but didn't charge us for the meal, leaving it to us to again, to get someone's attention to charge us which took another ten minutes or so before getting a female bartenders attention who seemed annoyed at the fact that she had to take care of us considering she was on the complete opposite end.  I have nothing else to add.... this was terrible...",

Huge beer selection, including quite a few sour beers which I enjoyed.  Food was also really good - we had the perogies as an appetizer (very good).  I had the burger which was also quite tasty and my husband had the chicken sandwich which he also liked!  Minus one star for the service - it took a long time for food to come out (and several times the incorrect food was brought to our table).  Also took a really long time to get our tab paid for at the bar.  I don't mind ordering and paying for the bill at the bar, as long as their staffed for it...which they didn't appear to.    Will definitely be back for the cool vibe, great drinks, and tasty food :)",

I love the outdoor space and drink selections, and have always received great service from the outdoor bartenders. However, nearly every time I've visited, I've had awful service from their rude staff whether it be a hostess or a food runner. I'm not sure what goes on, but no one seems happy and seems put-out to help the customer. Yesterday was the first time I tried brunch (sat outside where there is a limited brunch menu, different from the inside offering) and I was pretty disappointed. My egg sandwich was mediocre and certainly didn't match the price. I'm not sure I'll go back after another bad visit, despite the awesome location right on the rail trail.",

    "text": "Two visits confirmed this as a South End staple, both for food and drinks. Glad to see the expanded portfolio from Hyde Brewing fully in place and was nice to have lunch here on a random Friday without I being too crowded. Liked an IPA I had and my friend enjoyed the porter.   Similar to Sycamore, this is a \"see and be seen\" spot for the neighborhood, but I particularly like the use of greenery with the lofty ceilings, also seen at Divine Barrel Brewing over in NoDa. Plenty of seating options to choose from, both inside and out, and the location right on the Rail Trail makes it an ideal location for urbanites or those visiting town making use of the Blue Line. That is also a subtle way of saying parking is limited.   My first trip I was very pleased with the veggie burger, certainly one of the best versions I've had around town. Second time I went the opposite direction and enjoyed the uniquely styled wings; don't worry, there really isn't any spice and they were not messy to eat, so user friendly.   Good service AND they leave a glass carafe of water on the table, always gets points in my book. Suffolk Punch is a place helping Charlotte definite itself and continues ie to develop a distinct personality. I'll most certainly be back and easily ranks as one of my favorites in South End.",

    "text": "Ok, so what's all the buzz about Suffolk Punch?!  We decided to go there, multiples times, to find out.  Our first trip was with a few friends to chat about life in general.  We had no trouble finding a booth by the window to enjoy each other's company.  The food was great!  Being a vegetarian, I ordered the veggie burger and was not disappointed.  However, I requested blue cheese crumbles because I don't like goat cheese.  I was quickly informed they do not carry blue cheese (GASP).  It's like a staple of every kitchen serving burgers.  What!!?   I assumed my overreaction would cause them to reconsider adding the item on their menu.  Coming back a second time, we had burgers (mine being veggie again) and like the first time it was super delish.  I think they must put crack in their fries because I can't stop eating them.  Welp, still no blue cheese.  Grrrrrr.   Ok, so surely a third visit would do the trick.  Nope.  I came back with a large group of friends this time.  Still no dang blue cheese.  I'm going to have to BYOBC (bring your own blue cheese) next time.  So frustrating.  Anyway, my only critique beyond the blue cheese is that they only give you tiny cups with ketchup in them.  You have to order tons of cups to get enough ketchup for your fries.  Their Bloody Mary is good (not great... it could be spicier).  They plenty of seating and lots of great outdoor space.  I highly recommend coming here to hang out and eat.  However, be warned that they don't have blue cheese.   Hahaha.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "After spending a week in Charlotte for work, I needed a beer (or 4). The Suffolk Punch mixed two of the best things on the planet: quality food and craft beer. The outdoor seating is hip and plentiful; long wooden tables and benches sit under a hanging of string lights. The tables have their own collections of succulents, and the benches give a community vibe. I ordered the Suffolk Punch burger and a flight of five beers. The burger came with a pretzel bun, bourbon mustard, gruyere, and pickles. Word to the wise: I ordered it medium rare and it was pretty close to rare, so order a bit warmer than you normally would. The burger was a little messy, and I've learned I don't like pretzel buns, but a solid burger. Friends got the shaved wagyu sandwich (with gruyere, jus, and horseradish cream) and couldn't say enough good things. If you want to sit outside, you'll only have access to a limited menu, but the inside is beautiful and inviting. I grabbed a five-beer flight, and for $15, I was blown away. The samples were probably 6 oz, and I couldn't finish all five. Definitely a great bang for your buck if you want to try multiple beers. Overall awesome experience!",

The steak was cooked perfectly and the chimichurri sauce was a great compliment. We also ordered the Pork Belly, Seared Tuna, Crab Croquettes and Wagyu Carpaccio. They were all good but not great. I would suggest going here for brunch over dinner.",

The hall is a spacious warehouse but had great decorations and layout with spaces for dancing, the bar in the middle and the tables in the back. Dinner was family style and the bbq meats were delicious, beef spare ribs, chicken and pork. They had sides of vegetables and mac & cheese. The appetizers were shrimp po boy mini sandwiches and pork wonton dumplings and some sort of quiches. My hubs liked their IPA beer and I enjoyed the Pinot Grigio wine. I really liked the design of the space and the layout.  Parking is crazy because of the neighborhood but be prepared to walk to the venue.",

My dinner was very good, however, brunch was extremely disappointing :-(  the menu is simple and very appealing but the food lacked flavor and seasoning.   Food: I ordered the crab cake Benedict on an open English muffin was sooooo dry. There was barely any hollandaise sauce which in my opinion is the best part. The egg was almost cooked through. Everything about it lacked excitement or flavor to be remembered. My two other brunch companions had the Steak and eggs. The eggs were super runny, one of them had their steak brought very well done, the other was medium, both of them seemed very disappointed as well. The roasted potatoes were good (I ordered them on the side). The beer was the best part of my meal quite honestly!   Ambiance: We sat on the patio on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. No humidity and the fans felt perfect. It truly is very pretty and pleasant to sit outside but the down side is if you want to eat you have to order at the bar and it's brought to you. There isn't full service. The bar servers are very nice and are eager to help. All that said, I would return for drinks and perhaps dinner. While weather permits I love the patio but suggest getting a table inside if you choose to eat.",

The outdoor space is a great vibe as well where many restaurants miss the mark.   When coming to Suffolk Punch, try the in house Hyde beer. There are so many great ones so if you're not familiar, at least ask for a sampling before going to your normal.   Also, I'm going to request this publicly to bring back The Mildenhall Treasure! Who doesn't love a great champagne drink but for me, I loved the name. My son was born in England while stationed in RAF Mildenhall so the name made the drink that much more delicious! I hate to see it's gone.   TIP: If you can use Uber/Lyft or the light rail, do it. The parking is limited. I'm coming from the Lake Norman area so we always have to pray for parking when coming to SouthEnd.",

Sunday around 1:30 the place was packed inside and on the patio, there was a band playing good music and the vibe was positive. There was a 45 minute wait for an inside table, bar was full. Tip- you can check your place in line through a link that they send you via text.   Two seats opened at the bar so we ordered  drinks or at least tried to, bartenders looked like they were changing shifts or trying to decide who to serve next. After about 10 minutes we were acknowledged and received a menu by a very nice lady. I ordered a bloody mary extra spicy, it was good but not spicy.   Once we went to our table to eat we were very excited that we still made it in time for brunch, it was 2:15. Our server was very pleasant, great personality and very honest when asked a question about a meal.   I placed an order for Crab Cake Benedict $16 and a side of roasted potatoes $4. Benedict's are usually my go to brunch meal and I was definitely looking forward to trying these since the crab cakes were house made. Once I placed my order, the waiter asked me if I was ok with poached eggs, I thought that was strange but didn't think too much of it.   Order arrives and it's a beautiful presentation and looks perfect. After my second bite I realized something was totally wrong, I was eating an egg that was close to being hard boiled and definitely not poached. It made the meal kinda dry and it was just ok. Crab cakes were absolutely delicious and seasoned well.",

As we were going about our business clusters and intrepid solo travelers wandered through, mostly getting their morning beverages and going their merry ways, a few lingered in spacious hall working in the strong morning light.

The assorted pastries were not in public display, but the barista opened a Tupperware container to show me some muffin options.

The food has been pretty good every visit.  We have enjoyed the burgers and the sauteed NC shrimp as an appetizer. The beer has gotten better & better over the time they have been open. Our favorite is the Suffolk Punch- Don't Threaten Me with a Good Time IPA. On Thursdays and Sundays there are $3 Suffolk Punch beers which doesn't get better than that! There is plenty of inside and outside seating with a bar, TVs, and games outside too. Stay tuned to their social media pages for events and live music!   The only reason why I am giving 4 stars is because the staff can be \"stand-offish\" for lack of a better term. There have been numerous occasions when we have visited the bar attempting to buy a drink when the bartenders have basically ignored or have been disinterested in serving us. We visited at different times of the day and night and it is all the same. Hopefully this will change in the future!",

This review speaks to two different times I visited within a one week.   Visit #1 - Showed up shortly after arriving in North Carolina. My buddy has a soy allergy which means that he cannot eat out many places. Suffolk Punch, however, has a menu full of soy free options.   If soy is somehow the delicious ingredient everyone uses to make their food taste better, this place knows how to make the food to taste great without it.   Visit #2 - My buddy works within walking distance of this place. As a result, while he worked one day, I wandered over here at about 9 in the morning.   The espresso was on point and they had plenty of seating where one could work, read, or chat with your people.   There was an interesting vibe. It seemed to be half young professionals working on their home businesses and business executive types, in suits, meeting with clients/coworkers.   The beer is excellent. They must have at least 40 choices and they have something for everyone. Plus they do daily deals for the food or drinks. On Thursday, it's half price on all Suffolk Punch beers. That makes each craft beer about 3 bucks.   Can't wait to be in town again to visit this place.",

The outdoor seating it first come first serve and you order from their little outside food truck.   The brunch menu is not humongous. They have a few things that they perfect. About 10 adult options with a mix of salads, sandwiches, starters, and breakfast food.   I ended up getting the Chicken- N Biscuit which was fried chicken, scratch-made biscuit, scrambled eggs, and peppercorn chive gravy.   It was DELICIOUS! and a very large portion. The chicken was so fresh and fried perfectly they were stomped all over Chick-fil-a biscuits . Definitely recommend and I will be back and will enjoy the outdoor patio next time.   Only downside: Parking is very limited. Unless you live in South End and can walk there I suggest Ubering or even taking the train if you have access to that. I don't living closer to the Steele Creek area.",

The chicken biscuit looked amazing but we ordered crab cake Benedict and steak and eggs.   The crab cake Benedict was delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the crab cake was well seasoned. I was skeptical about the steak.  It looked dry but it was not.  No sauces needed for the steak.    There's an extensive drink menu.  A friend ordered a mimosa.  All champagne with a splash of orange juice. No one complaints about that.   I will go again for brunch or dinner.",

    "text": "The best part about this place is the spacious outdoor seating area. There are a bunch of cafeteria-style wooden benched tables with greenery in the middle which looked great and accommodated our huge party of 14 people. Unfortunately there weren't a lot of other strengths.  The food was just okay overall. I ordered the chicken biscuit with scrambled egg and gravy which looked better than it tasted. First of all there was not nearly enough gravy. And it was the unanimous decision of everyone at the table that the salt was sorely lacking. We also ordered a side of bacon which was decent and a side of hash brown casserole with pimento cheese which I must say was exceptional. Definitely the highlight of the meal.  I found the outdoor ordering process to be unnecessarily confusing and apparently the staff agrees, as there was a huge mixup with our bill. It eventually got worked out of course, but it was a headache I didn't really want to deal with on a lazy Sunday morning. The parking situation was also a nightmare. More negatives than positives IMHO.",

I felt heard and like they were genuinely shocked by my experience.  Today, it was a complete 180 from last time. It's hard to gauge because it was not nearly anywhere near as busy as last time.  I had a flt of beer, which I highly recommend. They do generous flt pours and you can pick any four from their full offerings. Also, on Thurs & Sundays they have $3 Suffolk Punch pints!   I also had their reuben, which I am a bit of a snob about. Theirs was definitely tasty, w/excellent meat to kraut to dressing ratio. Fries are def the recommended side for this dish as well.  Service was 1000% better this go round. Not only did I get my drink order taken right when I sat at the bar this time around, but my food order was taken and came out quickly! I wanted to have the espresso creme du pot on their dessert menu, but they weren't making it tonight. Instead I drank my dessert w/the tasty coffee cocktail \"Whiskey Business\".   All in all a completely different experience than my first, which I am more happy to share!",

If that's you, give it a try! It has a brewery/Coffee/food vibe. Which is chill, relaxing and comforting.    During the day you can bring your laptop and get work done while enjoy a sip of delicious well crafted coffee, and even grab a beer if that's your style with a great menu to choose from.   From the menu I definitely recommend the veggie burger! Very delicious.  The reason I'm not giving it a 5 and taking away a star is because one time I came with a bunch of friends and we ordered a dessert, which had nuts in it (not listed on the menu). My friend took a bit and has a slight allergy to peanuts (slight meaning tickling/stinging sensation in the throat but not anaphylactic). When we stated that to the waiter, he was angry that she took the bit because he could have reused that dessert for someone else! Wait what? Someone else? Then proceed to tell us they only have a limited number of desserts because they are frozen.   It made me really sad that this event occurred because I had high hopes for this place.   I still enjoy the vibe and drinks. But definitely won't be getting any dessert anytime soon, and be double checking if there are nuts in anything, especially if you have an allergy!",

Well I really couldn't care less about the beer, even though that was good as well. It advertises as a restaurant so I am writing based in the actual food. I ordered a salad with field greens and roasted beets.  Its was pretty small for a salad and the beets were not roasted at all. Definitely came straight from a jar out of the fridge.  The taste of it was ok despite not being as advertised. I could see someone not liking it because the greens were very bitter.  Stronger than arugula.   I ordered some wagyu steak on the side and it came out pretty much raw-- rarer than rare.  And about 5 small squares or meat. I was never asked how I wanted it-- but none the less it was ok.  Not the best flavor.   It was not even hot.  They could have added some more pistachios and lettuce to the salad.   Maybe some extra lemon dressing.   But for the price they charge I would not eat here again.   Definitely not worth the high prices. But I will come back for the atmosphere and a drink.",

    "text": "Check out the new kid on the brewery block. This brewery is across the street from one of the best breweries in Charlotte, Triple C. The bad thing, parking is now terrible around here. I drove around a lot before finally deciding reluctantly to part in front of one of the buildings that didn't have a sign saying they would tow your car away. My suggestion, since this brewery is located right next to a light rail station, is park in the train lot and right the train here.  This place was absolutely packed when we arrived around 5 pm. I'm amazed that there are that many people available! given the number of breweries. I think because they have a great food option as well, it makes this place like a super brewery. They have a large outside area and a large inside area. I think they kick people out of the inside tables around 5 pm and it begins to be used exclusively for sit down table service. We got on a waiting list and it took about 45 minutes to get a table, fortunately, we got an outside table. Less noisy and the weather was really nice. They also have an outside tap area, so you can get a beer outside, and sit at the outside picnic tables and avoid the crowded inside area. They weren't brewing their own beer yet when we went there, so have to wait on that. They had lots of other local craft options and a full bar service.  This remains me a of a wicked weed style place. A little higher end business feel, with lots of beer and food options. Its not your typical brewery feel. Its good, and will always be packed I think because it offers so much, but it doesn't really have a brewery feel either. I'll be back, but might stop by the real brewery, Triple C first, first for a beer before crossing the street to get some good food!",

    "text": "Understandably, this place is new so it's PACKED on weekends. My friends and I went on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. We had a party of six and about an hour wait as they only serve food inside. The good news was, they have a huge patio to hang out on. Downside, you have to wait inside to get drinks before finding a seat outside. I'd recommend they add waiters/waitresses for drinks outside too especially with the long wait times for tables. Plus more tips for them right?  Anyway, we enjoyed a couple rounds trying a few of their different drafts - the selection is a little overwhelming because there are so many unique options. After about an hour, we were finally buzzed for our table (they text you btw. Or you can track progress via a link to Yelp after you put your name in).  I was a little disappointed at how small their menu is, but figured the burger as seen on other tables looked sufficient.   We started with the pickles which btw are not fried - we assumed they were. For $5 you get a small bowl of homemade slightly dill pickles. They were fresh and tasty at least and came out quick. Next, several of us (4 of 6) ordered the burger and fries, one friend got the bacon and tortillas and another got a salad and the potato croquets.   The burger was delicious as were the fries. The bacon was more like strips of fatty pork belly served with grilled tortillas (I'm so happy i didn't order it because I would have hated it). My friend said they were good enough.   Overall it was okay. I probably wouldn't be a frequent visitor for dinner due to long waits and small selection, but it'd be a great hangout spot to grab drinks and catch up with friends on the patio. Plus they have a killer location right at the light rail.",

I'm finding this is becoming a problem in many establishments (or it's because I'm getting more life experience, aka older ;) )  Our server was very friendly and helpful in walking us through the menu and making some suggestions. We had 2 different beers both brewed by Hyde, I wish I remembered the names, both were delicious.   We shared the tuna, fried green tomatoes, and deviled eggs from the small plates, and the pickled grape salad, added shrimp. Everything we ate was outstanding!   Despite being a converted warehouse with industrial decor, the place felt warm and welcoming, probably thanks to the plants hanging from baskets throughout the restaurant and the warm colors used on leather booths. Kudos to the designer(s).",

I ordered a Bloody Mary from a female bartender and she barely put a splash of vodka in it. I thought maybe I had missed something so I said nothing. But after tasting it it was clear she made it really weak. I asked her to throw some more vodka in there but she gave me a nasty look and said shes not supposed to do that. I gave her a nasty look back and told her if she made it right in the first place i would not have to ask. She threw another splash of cheap well vodka in. It still tasted like mix only but I'm not looking for an argument so I walked. My advice to management is tell servers dont go cheap on the mixed drinks. I mean, what's your motive? Well alcohol is cheap anyway. Make the customers happy so they come back and give you more money.",

Said they served food until 11pm and then when we went to order a cheese plate at 10:45 they threw a huge hissy fit. If you're going to serve food until 11 serve it til 11.   The south end needs a place to grab drinks and food late night. This isn't it. Don't come here for that.",

    "text": "Checked out The Suffolk Punch on opening night with the wife and (1.5 year old) kid...  Great place! Awesome atmosphere, A+ service, fantastic large patio right on the rail trail, great beer selection even before their own brews are available. Food was also delicious, though my only complaint is that some of the portions were a little light for the price point; but hey, that's what you get for a place that's definitely a grade or two higher in class than most of the other brewery options around town.   We got a bit busy trying to keep the toddler busy as the food came out, so I only managed to snag a photo of the potato croquettes, all the food looked as great as it tasted though.   We will definitely be back to sample more of the selection and enjoy the patio sans-kids.   ...went back for coffee/breakfast and it was also fantastic. Loved the draft coffee \"hoptail\"",

The menu has a lot of classics but they are served with great presentation and great flavors. Got a flight of 5 beers of my choice which was great since the list is so long you want to try them all! They also have great cocktails. Atmosphere is fun - people stand at the bar inside and out, and they also have big tables for large parties and booths for smaller parties. High ceilings and really cool decor make for a cool place to hang out. Gets quieter around 9 or so but is definitely a great place for happy hour.",

Loved all the green plants and pristine bar. Plenty of beers on tap and not the same ol beers you see in every bar around Charlotte. We tried the fries, mushrooms, and potato croquettes. Fries were fine, but nothing special. Mushrooms were oily and not so great. But the croquettes were awesome! The hosts (3) seemed to have no clue what was going on and some of the staff seemed a bit unprepared. However it was their first night so I can't really hold it against them. I will definitely be back for some prime patio sitting and diving more into their menu.",

I realize that your restaurant doesn't officially open until this weekend (by the way amazing restaurant atmosphere), so I understand there should be some leeway in terms of service/food, etc. Unfortunately, real money was spent. I went with my girlfriend and another couple, three of us got burgers and one got the grouper. This was in addition to a few rounds of Hyde beers and shishito peppers. Between my gf and I, the bill was $71 after tip! It's just burgers and beer! There are A LOT of places to get that in Charlotte, and not spend half that, AND you're brewing beer on site. On top of that, the fries were lukewarm, the other couple said the foie gras popcorn \"tasted like regular popcorn but for $6\", and the burger was so, so, so salty. We're an easy crowd to please, and we all agreed it was a forgettable meal. I hope you can work out the kinks, because the location and atmosphere are great. The food, not so much.",

He made my last two experiences there awful and I might not come back. Another thing they might need to fix is the chef with all of the hoops in his ear probably needs to learn how to be somewhat quiet and respect his staff some more. He was a little scary and seemed disrespectful. Hope some of the staff gets fixed so I actually might enjoy myself when I come back.",

Kind of weird. Anyway, we get in there see that there's a coffee bar, then a beer bar around the corner. Plenty of people working, not a single person looked up to say hi, or welcome in, be with you in a sec... ok, so we sit down, after sitting there a bit we realized people don't come to you so we went to the bar to order drinks and food. Again, I came here for the food after reading reviews and seeing pics. We ask for a food menu and the bar tender says, \"we don't serve food anymore.\" And we are like, what? And then he says \"well, we don't serve food until 5pm.\" Uugghh! The whole reason I came was to try the food. I was pretty disappointed. Atmosphere is cute, customer service is pretty bad, and it's lame that food wasn't served until 5pm. I won't be going back.",

I was with all beer drinkers, so they ordered a combination of local beers and beer from Hyde (which is apart of the restaurant). I'm a wino - so I perused the wine list and ordered a sauvignon blanc.    We ordered 2 appetizers, the bratwurst and the bc shrimp. I don't eat sausage so I can't speak to the brat, but the shrimp was well cooked and flavorful    For dinner, I ordered the vegetarian nachos with shrimp. While this is an appetizers, it's absolutely huge and makes a great entree! Recommend that!   I feel like the whole coffee, bar, restaurant concept is really growing here. I can't say I've actually ever had coffee here before though.   The ambience and atmosphere is cool. It's a huge space. We sat on the elevated tables near the back of the restaurant. I like that you can see right through to the brewery. It's really neat and different. The outside area is really cool a- I look forward to spending time there this summer!",

There's indoor restaurant style seating and bar seating or outdoor tables for some fresh air. The setup is open and modern. A great place to chill if you have down time. Suffolk Punch has great food, excellent coffee , and of course beer.   Lenny Boy brewery is a couple blocks away for Kombucha or draft beer, as well.  Triple c brewery is next door. Olde mecklenberg brewery is 6 minutes away by car.   The light rail stop (new bern stop) is right behind Suffolk. Hit up the next stop or rent a bicycle (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcharlotte.bcycle.com&s=05f4f984957ed24fe7406cb5f0ce1dee1e04637b2cbfe95863b910b1a277a1af\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">charlotte.bcycle.com</a> ) and try Futo Buto if you want some legit ramen.",

My husband and I stopped in on Valentine's Day to check this place out for the first time. I immediately fell in love with the vibe inside. All the plants just gave it a great atmosphere feel. I also loved the patio area.   We grabbed a seat at the bar. My hubby ordered one of the Hyde Brewing beers and I got a mixed drink (don't remember the name but it had whisky, raspberry puree, and club soda). Both drinks were good. The beer list was fairly extensive and included beers from other local breweries. We ordered the Wagyu beef with dipping sauce as an appetizer. Absolutely delish. I loved the dipping sauce and the meat was so flavorful!  Service was so good! We even got candy for Valentine's day! Absolutely will return!",

I got excited when I heard they were going to have a morning coffee window, and then quickly disappointed when it was fancy, extremely over-priced coffees.  Food was good, but they are small plates and having a meal gets expensive there.  I do like their patio, it's a great space and they have done a great job with the space both inside and outside.  Very unique and different.  To me it just does not have the feel of a brewery and they serve more beers from other breweries than their own.",

Other outdoor breweries don't typically do that.  What got me to write this review though was their care of their customer. I have a somewhat embarrassing story to explain this. After a long day in the South End with some friends and a family member who was visiting I couldn't find my car. We parked at Suffolk Punch in the morning and to everyone's memory we had not moved the car since, we walked from place to place. It's now 1AM and the Suffolk Punch lot is empty so my first thought was \"It was towed or taken.\" I went inside to Suffolk Punch and the night manager there was more than helpful, he could have just said \"no we don't tow sorry now get out\" but he came out to the lot with us and waited for the police to show up to try and figure it out. On top of that he actually sent one of his bartenders in their car to search for my car.  End of the story, the bartender found my car some blocks away at another brewery. To all of our memories, I blame the long day, but I thank the Suffolk Punch for all their help in what could've been a really bad end to a good day.",

There could have been some miscommunication about what we wanted, but at first we had a waiter who was going to take drink orders and then they never came back so we just went to the bar to order.   Anyway, this morning's brunch made up for it. First off, I LOVE the space. I love the plants hanging and along the bar. The fresh green mixed in with the wood and metal is really nice. I'm also a sucker for cool logos and incorporating the designs around the place, which Suffolk Punch/Hyde does really well. We got there at noon and had no wait getting a table. Two of us opted for the omelet and one got the French toast (which looked amazing). Omelet was also yummy! The side was fingerling potatoes, which are actually just French fries but they were pretty good as well. I got a side of bacon- DELICIOUS. I will say the coffee was $3 and then there was an additional charge for another cup. They brewed it fresh, but kind of expected a coffee refill to be free.   Otherwise, service was great and the food was also really good. We will definitely be back to try other stuff on the menu, including the cocktails!",

Since we were sharing I was able to look past this because I only had a small piece.   30 min later our drinks came. After asking numerous times for them.   Another 30 min later our food came. I ordered the hash. I was expecting seasonal veggies as the menu said but it was 95% potatoes. I had a few bites of quartered Brussels and maybe a slice or two of carrots. And by slice. I mean a literal slice of carrot. If you want veggies don't order this. To make it worse, my over easy eggs, were overly cooked. As far from over easy as you can get. You might as well call it a hard boiled egg in over easy display. So extremely disappointing.   I don't leave bad reviews. But I wish I had a warning about this place before going. So many good options in Charlotte and I hate I missed out with this stop before heading back home to Michigan. Next time. Definitely won't be a stop here.   I told our waitress but of course she didn't really seem to care as she was obviously exhausted from The day and only could concern herself with clearing our dishes before the 4pm Crowd came.",

    "text": "Excellent service,  ambiance, and food! We came here on a whim for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was myself,my mother, sister, and my 11 month old daughter. We sat outside as the weather was perfect. I love that you can seat yourself, order your food (and drinks) at the bar, and then they bring everything to you. The vibe is very laid back! There are high chairs for babies which I loved. The outdoor seating is also pet friendly. I noticed they even put out bowls of water for dogs which I thought was sweet.  The bartender made EXCELLENT drinks. I left having 2 drinks and felt NICE (lol) after leaving. We ordered a carafe of mimosa and then I had a cucumber mule which was AWESOME! For breakfast we had shrimp and grits, and also the suffolk breakfast  (eggs, bacon, sausage, and grits (my mom got hers with potatoes).  We received our food quickly and the servers were kind.  I loved that my daughter could people watch and walk around the outdoor area freely without feeling like we were bothering anyone or in the way. She loved looking at the dogs and walking around the picnic tables.    After brunch we walked alongside the light rail strip for a bit and then headed back to our car.  It was a great afternoon. We will definitely be back as I want to see what Hyde Brewery has to offer!",

    "text": "Suffolk Punch is a great option in South End and not too far from the light rail. Parking can be challenging as there are no lots and it's all on-street parking. We parked near a friends home and walked over so we had no issues.   The vibe is relaxed and trendy with a slight industrial feel. We had a fairly large party but they were able to seat us right away. Their largest table was taken, but they were able to squeeze all nine of us in a to a six-person table. We appreciated not having to wait.  Water was already set out on the table. And drink orders were put in quickly. They have an extensive beer menu. That night it was only $3 for any Charlotte beers on the menu. There are cocktails, but they don't have a full bar. From what my coworkers said, the cocktails were very good. And there's a few wines on the menu as well. It's definitely a great place to grab a drink.   The menu has both small plates and meals. So you can decide if you want something small or a meal for yourself. I ordered the F.L.T. sandwich with a salad. The F.L.T. was a fried green tomato, bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich on toasted wheat bread with a herbed mayo. I loved this sandwich.  It didn't feel overly greasy, and the fried green tomatoes can be a dish on their own. They were crisp and flavorful.  I wish there was a little more mayo on the sandwich, but it was still satisfying. The side salad was so fresh with green lettuce, raddichio, carrot and red pepper. Normally I order dressing on the side, but they had a very light vinegrette mixed in and was still delicious.    I'd love to come back for drinks and small plates. I regret not getting the charcuterie plate and would love to go back for that.",

    "text": "Separate review from Hyde Brewing - but go check them out too! Great beer!  I've eaten at Suffolk Punch twice, and have been impressed by two dishes: the potato croquettes and the veggie burger. The Goose had never had a croquette before (I lived in Spain for 6 months so those things are my kryptonite). The croquettes at Suffolk Punch lived up to the dish's expectations! Creamy and perfectly crisp on the outside. Nom.  The veggie burger gets a shout out because it puts a different spin on a pretty standard dish. The patty is quinoa/black bean, which is pretty normal, but they jazzed it up with a tangy BBQ sauce and goat cheese. It was surprising and delicious! The hand cut fries did pretty well too :)",

Good Atmosphere-check.  When you first walk in, it's a little confusing.  I'm going to The Suffolk Punch, but I think I might be at Hyde Brewery?  I walked in the door and after finally seeing a sign to go to the back of the restaurant, I found the hostess stand.  We put our name in on the No Wait app, so we only ended up waiting for about 15 minutes (vs. the quoted 30-45 min).  As I waited, I looked around at the beautiful plants hanging from the ceiling, the games that were playing on the TVs throughout the inside and the large outdoor space with patio tables.  I thought to myself, this would be a great place to come with a group to watch football!  They can certainly accommodate large groups.  We stopped at the bar to grab a drink first.  Might as well!  Their cocktails were refreshing and their beer list was extensive.  The bar was also really long and they have a ton of taps, so the bartender struggle a bit with remembering drinks as he was running back and forth.  I also noticed that they have a little coffee bar off to the side.  It's pretty hidden, but I wouldn't think to come here in the morning for my caffeine fix.  Once we were seated, we went through the menu.  Starters were the Heirloom Tomatoes (came recommended by the waitress), Summer Squash and Potato Croquettes.  Everything was very good and super fresh!  I loved the Potato Croquettes because, I mean, who doesn't love fried potato balls in a yummy tomato sauce?!  For entrees, we had the fish and the roasted chicken (which was slightly overcooked, but still tasty).  Overall, great new spot!  Food and atmosphere are lively.  Perfect place for a group of people to meet for drinks.  Service was slow all around, so plan to be patient.  Their menu is very inventive, so I'll be back to try more!",

    "text": "Short version: Go for the beer, service and ambience. The food left much to be desired and there is no coffee or tea past 4pm on weekdays and 5pm Friday-Sunday.   Long version: This place had been on my list for months and finally the hubs and I got to check it out. There is a small gravel parking lot on the right side of the building and some random street parking on the block.    On the Saturday night that we went, they had guys at the door carding patrons before entering. Once we walked past the bathrooms and hallway that passes the brewery, we got to the hostess and they seated us right away. Our waitress came over promptly with a glass pitcher of water and glasses. I love when restaurants do this because my hubby goes through a lot of water so it's nice to just serve yourself a glass. I saw tea and coffee on the menu with a note that said the full menu was not available after 4pm on weekdays and 5pm on weekends but what they actually mean is that none of the options are available...zero...no regular American coffee, no tea of any kind. This was unfortunate for me because I really wanted something warm and part of the reason we went there was to try their coffee.   I ordered an unsweet tea with no ice. My hubs ordered a beer. We also ordered from the small plates: Pork Belly, Charred Wings and Crab Croquettes. My tea came with a paper straw (yay for them doing good for the environment) but it tasted mildly fermented and had thin layer of foam/head on top that I was not a fan of.     The best food item we had was the charred wings. Those guys were really tasty and well done. Not sure where they get the wings from because they are tiny but meaty and tasted very good. The pork belly left much to be desired, it was bland and the rice cake it was served with was also very bland. The Crab croquettes were cooked really nicely, and definitely had plenty of crab, but also left a lot to be desired. The elote with cheese that came with the crab was also pretty tasteless.     It was so disappointing. Honestly, the service was great, the food looked very nicely presented but the flavors just weren't there. The place seemed very nice to just hang out and drink beer. The bathrooms were clean and even the guys carding at the door were super friendly but if it's food you are after; I cannot recommend.    Who knows? Maybe it was an off night?",

First off, the space is incredible. Very open, lots of natural wood, and a huge patio. From the front you would not have guessed the size of this place. In addition, I like the idea of combining a brewery, coffee bar, and restaurant all in one - and right off the rail trail!   Full disclaimer before we go further, I only had a few beers here and an appetizer - not a full dinner. That being said, I tried 2 of Hyde's beers (FYI Hyde brewing is part of the Suffolk Punch, that confused me for a while) and enjoyed both while my wife had a mixed drink. We also ordered a Wagyu beef appetizer with dipping sauce and found it to be excellent. I'll be excited to come back once the weather warms up a bit and sit on the patio to try more of their menu and beer selection.",

The only thing remotely close for me to eat was a steak. The steak came with truffled potatoes. I don't eat potato's because it messes with my blood sugar. I asked to substitute the potatoes for a salad. We waited ten minutes to order to give the waitress time to inquire whether it is possible to make the substitution, we watched her. She never went to the back to ask the chef or manager. By the time we order, I asked if she could accommodate, she quickly said, No! Ok, I'll order nothing!  I understand making substitutions is not ideal but, make the effort. If it cost more money ok, give me the option. The waitress was the problem here, unless it is the  restaurants decision to not allow substitutions.",

I say that because they are a brewery that has an extensive menu with beer and coffee. While that may be okay for some, I'd much prefer they advertise as a restaurant. I had no idea they had that much.   Overall the interior is beautiful, green and spacious. The bar is good but they also have coffee. Although good, a few of their items are definitely overpriced considering it is a brewery. The staff was attentive but on the first visit my Fiancee's burger wasn't done (twice) and we ordered food that they actually didn't have that night. There seemed to be a bit of poor communication amongst the kitchen and FOH staff.   I'll definitely go back but most likely just for drinks.",

This is the type of price I would expect from a rooftop bar like Merchant & Trade but not from this place. This isn't Punch Room... come on. The staff seems fine but they have only one speed... slow. They are nice enough but again, very, painfully slooooow and appear to be lacking in service industry experience. When it is busy, as it usually is, this makes for a long frustrating wait.

The drink  menu is fairly extensive, and the staff seem more than willing to give you recommendations and small samples to find something you'd like. As i didn't want beer that evening, the bald, bearded bartender suggested a cocktail that he was able to whip up which was very good. He and the rest of the staff were very friendly and welcoming despite being a bit busy.  I I'll definitely need to return to try some of their Hyde beers as they continue to roll them out.

    "text": "I came here the other night as I had been hearing really good things about Suffolk. To start, the decor and ambiance is incredible. Its very open and a great place to hang. The outdoor patio is even more incredible and has plenty of room so it never really feels crowded. I started with one of their beers think it was the Donington - one of Hyde's own brews. Really enjoyed it. Then I checked out their cocktail list - even MORE killer! I had come to try the beers but ended up falling in love with the inventive craft cocktails they had. I would recommend the Lime in the Coconut or the Hyde Daisy. Whether you are a cocktailer or a beer drinker - you cant go wrong with the beverages here. We also got a few bites to eat - peppers, potato croquettes and the smoked heirloom tomatoes. All of which were stellar. Lastly, but what I consider to be most important was the service. Regardless of how good the drinks, ambiance or food is, if the service sucks, it can ruin a place. However, Hyde/Suffolk comes out on top in this department. When I first arrived, the bartender working - (Mike? i think was his name?) helped me find a beer he thought I would like and then introduced me to that tantalizing cocktail menu! Not only was he helpful and kind but he was very attentive even with the busy night he had been having - he's also easy on the eyes ;) I also met another bartender who said she had recently started with Suffolk but has worked in the industry for quite some time - just by watching her work and seeing her interacting with customers and the bar staff, you can tell that she knows what shes doing. She was very professional and on top of her game. Also was another incredibly nice person (Rachel? or Reagan?). Both of them were a class act & really worked hard to make sure everyone and everything was taken care of. No question, I will be back and am adding Hyde/Suffolk to my regular spot rotation :) Looking forward to enjoying many more nights here! Definitely a place to check out!",

My mom and I shared the mussels and steak and it was all perfectly cooked and tasted even better. We all loved the interior decor. It does get a little crowed as the night goes on but other then that it is a great place to sit and have a meal with family and friends . RJ the chef is an amazing cook!!!!",

    "text": "Went to try out the new spot last Saturday. Very cool place. Hung outside for awhile, while waiting for a table to eat inside. Bartenders outside sucked and were sweating profusely. They had a water container that was empty 99.9% of the time and they couldn't provide water any other way which was ridiculous on a 95 degree day. When we finally got sat by the 8 year old hostess who has never worked a day in service industry in her life, the service was embarrassingly bad. Food was good but way over priced. The best service we got was from the food runner! Most of the beers they claimed to have were all sold out. Clearly new places have bumps in the road while opening but I doubt I'll be back despite the cool atmosphere.",

    "text": "It's hard for me to understand how many reviewers for this brew pub could give it a good  rating. There was not one acceptable thing I could say about our experience. From the start with sloppy bartenders; actually had to ask for napkins to clean up their mess, untrained wait staff,  an inexperienced and bit officious hostess, 3 guys hanging by the hostess stand doing nothing and looking like the 3 stooges.  7  diners ordered 5 appetizers and 7 meals. Meats were dry and over cooked, fried green tomato were to thick, too green and poorly fried, French fries too done in bad oil.  The chef and expediter need to look at what is coming out of their kitchen.  It was an awful experience.  Not planning on a second visit.  Too many other good proven choices.",

    "text": "Had our first experience at The Suffolk Punch.  I really only have one tip and one complaint for anyone who is visiting. Parking is TERRIBLE. I get that comes with the location, but it was difficult to find a spot on a weekday at 6:00. I really wish they would offer flights - there are so many great beers! (take note, in order to get samples you have to go to the bar, your server will not bring it to your table) Now on to all the great things - what an awesome atmosphere. Good food options and again, nice beer selection. The croquettes were very good and the burger was amazing and flavorful. The creole shrimp didn't give the \"kick\" I would have hoped for, it was almost watered down, so I would probably pass on that in the future.  The burger, shrimp, and croquettes were perfect split between 2 people. Great crowd, and the service was OK. Overall, we will be back for sure. Glad to have found this spot!",

    "text": "Giving 4 stars because I went on their 3rd night open so giving them a pass on some stuff related to just getting started. The atmosphere is the best part which is meaningful in charlotte where a lot of new places are built in a spec space with minimal upfit. The food was OK. Mussels and shitshito pepper were a 8/10. Burger was over salted so a 5/10 relative to all the good burgers in town. We got a blue gin cocktail that was sent back. They did take off the bill and replaced with a nice rose at no charge. Service was good not great but most hiccups just new place kinks expected with large crowds. Staff was high quality probably just a little overwhelmed. Will go back in a few weeks with hope the food and drink are a bit better. At worst it's a good place to hang and drink the beer and wine.",
