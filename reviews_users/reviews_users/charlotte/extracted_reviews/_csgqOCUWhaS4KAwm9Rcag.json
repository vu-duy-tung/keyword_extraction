The unique thing I saw with this location was a floating \"island\" where all the ketchup, napkins, straws, and anything else you need (minus the sauces) reside.  There is a fairly large dinging room with fresh flowers (the happened to be daffodils) on each table that is well maintained.",

I always just stand at the register and no one helps me, even though I've made eye contact with them. I counted 9 people behind the counter and one was a manager just walking around. The one kid that helped me  was cleaning out the ice cream machine and had to stop doing what he was doing since no one else was serving us; His name was Wisdom ( great kid). This has been the third time I've gone inside that store and no one seems to ever assist me. I shouldn't have to flag someone down and ask them if I could order, I could understand if there was 1 or 2 people working but 8 or 10 makes no sense. Customer service is at the top at my workplace but this place doesn't really seem like they care.",

You can go in with a bad survey for a free meal and they will screw that up too. They get lazy and leave the chicken in the bater too long and it makes the chicken all clumpy and crunchy. When you take it back they give you another one with the same problem. Not impressed with this location. There are two others near by. One North and one in Baxter. Go to them but avoid this one. Problem is too many people go there and don't complain so as long as they are making money...you guessed it....they don't care. So I won't care either and won't be going back.",

Luckily I was able to use the WiFi that Chick-fil-a offers (A Great Thing) to complete some work while I waited.

I've also noticed a dramatic shift in their employees  :-(  I understand one can only hire those that apply, but try to remember that chic fil a has a higher standard than most so whomever you employ needs to be held to those standards.

I have come here at least 100 times in the 2 years I've lived in the area and have had way more negative experiences than positive. Tonight, for example, I ordered a Grilled Cobb salad and a 8 count nugget meal-with a larger diet lemonade. I get to the window to pay and the young man who took my order tries to hand me a regular sized lemonade. I told him it was supposed to be a large and he looks at me like I'm crazy.  Whatever, it is what it is. Then, we got home and sat down to eat and my salad is missing it's dressing. Now, I could get over a missing dipping sauce for the chicken nuggets (which we were missing) as you can eat them without it. However, a salad is typically much better with dressing. Obviously it's much healthier without, but it sure tastes better. I've tried to call the location no less than 3 times to no avail. No one will answer. Not that there's anything they can do now, as I'm not driving back to get dressing, but it's extremely annoying.  I'll be driving to another location from now on, I've learned my lesson.",

She even had the audacity to hold her phone up as if she took a photo of it. She continued to laugh uncontrollably each time he was in front of her.  I didn't get her name but I know she wore glasses and had a ponytail (light brown hair). She was sitting with two other guys on a break. Luckily my husband convinced me to walk away from the situation because I was ready to catch a case. This is not the behavior I expect from Chick-Fil-A employees! The owner/manager needs to do a rehire of the staff there because I've never experienced such rudeness at any Chick-Fil-A location like this one!",

Personality of  rock) Manager printed out another receipt and gave it to new girl, who told me she added the charge back on my card. Two days later I still don't see a credit. I asked the cashier to just please give me back the 2.99 plus tax in cash and call it done, but she looked like a deer in the headlights. Geez, gotta drive back over there, go inside and talk to someone about a 2.99 refund. Frickin pain in the ass!",

After getting in the long line that I soon would realize wasn't moving, I physically couldn't get my car out of it since they had it between a row of cars. When I got to the ordering system, I had to wait another 5 min before the girl came back on the intercom to take my order. After a total of 30 minutes of being in line, I finally got to the window to pick up my food. The staff member at the window did not say A WORD to me, even after I said thank you for my drinks. Then another staff member handed me my food (I think she was the manager) and did not give an apology or a guest card. This is not the Chick-fil-A service that I have seen at other restaurants and this has happened in the past at the same restaurant. I hope this location gets their act together before they start losing customers!",

When a restaurant is popular a lot of people ant to visit at all the same time.  This store can get crowded.  In fact, they have 2 auto lanes going at all the appropriate times, as well as the meandering walk-in line.    The food, of course is awesome.  They have all my favorite bites, but it's the traditional Chick-fil-A Sandwich that keeps me coming back for more.  I'm also a huge fan of their fresh squeezed lemonade. It doesn't get any better than that.  I usually go for the diet because the sugar in the high octane version makes me bounce off the walls.    Recently they discontinued their Coleslaw.  That was a huge disappointment. I used to top my sandwich with their slaw. I considered better than most homemade styles at local establishments.  Fortunately they made the recipe available to the public online. Yes, I've learned to make my own.  Thanks Chick-fil-A.  Best bet with this store is to avoid the drive-thru and head inside. Moves quite fast and they have a very nice eating area.  Use their App to order ahead if you can.  Makes everything much easier.  Kudos to the staff. Very helpful and always smiling. Love the food.",

    "text": "I've eaten here multiple times - at least once per week. This place has constant issues in the kitchen. Prior to Feb 2019, the place was frequently out of stuff during the lunch and dinner hour. I ordered breakfast burritos on three separate occasions but they couldn't fix eggs due to not having the ability to cook them (was told the grill wasn't working on all 3 occasions). On another occasion I ordered a breakfast item 20 min before they transition to lunch and they didn't count their breakfast orders correctly and had to substitute items when I finally got through the drive thru line. Lemonade has been out four times, during the 5-7pm dinner rush in recent weeks. Since mid-March the service has slightly improved but it still needs major work. Staff turnover is part of the problem - which I think boils down to poor and disrespectful management (I'll get to that point next). Food has been more consistently cooked since summer began, but the wait times vary and can exceed 20 minutes sometimes, depending on who is stationed at the drive-thru window and working the drive thru line. Wednesday mornings are some of the worst times to come here per my experience. Not sure why.   More recently, I've witnessed two awful staff encounters with a female manager whose name begins with an \"F.\" She is so rude and unprofessional toward her staff it's appalling. This manager is on some sort of power trip - one morning she ripped a young girl with glasses who I thought did a fantastic job under the busy circumstances. This past week, this same manager scolded a teen male with longish hair for something ignorant - it was ridiculous and it bothered me so much I almost said something to her. The one employee (teen guy) is always working hard when I'm there. Another employee witnessed the scolding and shook her head over the encounter. It was upsetting to watch. This female manager shouldn't be there especially given how bad the turnover is at this place. I'm surprised anyone can tolerate working with this woman given how she behaves toward her staff. There's another African-American male manager who is very professional and does a great job each time I interact with him and he interacts with others. Upper management needs to reassign \"F\" to do other tasks or let this person go altogether, and when this occurs I think staff turnover will likely decrease.",

I have seen other locations that send out employees to take orders in the the drive thru line, and this is faster and more efficient.",

The wait is soooooo long and most times my order is wrong or I'm missing some things which in turn I have to have my daughter go in since I ordered in drive thru which having to do that defeats the purpose of going thru drive thru. Most of the time u hear the teens talking and laughing on the other end of the speaker. I just don't get it. 3yrs algo this place was fast and had great service! Never got my order wrong! Now some of them don't even say hello at the drive thru either. Please fix it! I see so many what look like managers and workers that I don't understand the wait or mess ups.",

Other Chick fil A restaurants have good food and fast service but, not only is the service  S L O W at this restaurant, the food is hit or miss. Plan accordingly if you're trying to grab quick fast food on your work break!",

EACH time I get something simple, a sandwich or strips, and after I pay I'm told to park at the front so I don't hold up people behind me and that my food will be brought to me ASAP. I see cars leave the drive thru and I'm waiting, and waiting. I usually time at being a 3 minute wait or longer. When I finally receive my order I'm not given an apology or a \"guest card\" like other locations provide to customers in situations like that.  I don't understand why this happens, and it seems to happen only to me.  Food is excellent but the service is not what I have come to expect from this chain.",

The manager came over and spoke to us and apologized for our wait (we didn't wait long either). They had something break but still kept composure and hospitality! Very nice and they definitely deserve being recognized for the customer service (the food is always great)!",

We have been to this restaurant several times and each time we seem to have an issue.They have been serving dried up breakfast biscuits in the morning. One time we went they said they did not have any salt packets and we asked if they could loan us a salt shaker in drive-through and they said they did not have any of those either. How does a restaurant run out of salt?  A week later we got there chicken strips and they ran out of Chick-fil-A sauce. These are basic things that you can stockpile that you should never run out of.",

It's time to truly reflect on practice because this location is really falling out. Chick fil a is known for quality service and this location needs to improve!",
