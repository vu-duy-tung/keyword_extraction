    "text": "Wow, this has to be the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant, and I've been to places that no human being should ever set foot in, around the world.  We waited here for over 15 minutes, and not one person came to take our order.  That doesn't even happen in Manhattan!  You can see the workers here play favorites, though: I don't know if it was the the manager or just some worker running the show that day, but he had a long conversation in Hindi with some family with their kid, and then let them in and serve them....all the while pretending that we and some other patrons were not there.  Whoever owns this place: this took place at lunch time on Veterans Day, 2013.  I think you need to fire or deport some people here.  One person who was really nice was the lady up front.  She was really kind and welcoming,  and it looked like she was angry at the servers for being slack, but they were disrespecting her.  It was sad to see.    This place looks nice and has nice decor: but 15 minutes with no service?  Maybe they think they are in India, and patrons need to bribe the servers for service?  Seriously, do NOT go there if you are starving or on a date with someone you care about.  You will be utterly humiliated.  It's like that episode of \"Seinfeld\" where they go to a Chinese Restaurant, but never get seated; the only difference is that you get seated, but then forgot about and left to die.  lol.  We just walked out and got great service at Mellow Mushroom a few doors down.  Great vegan pizza there.  We were visiting Charlotte and whenever we return, we won't be coming to the Blue Taj, which should be renamed the \"Ewww Taj.\"",

It's a great place: cool looking, in a neat indoor/outdoor mall, the service was great, and the food was exceptional.   We had two apps, red wine, two entrees and naan. All were fantastic. Bill was c. $50.   We will go back anytime we have a reason to be in Charlotte.  It'd be great if you could open a location in Columbia.",

We arrived with no reservation on a Thursday evening, around 8:00PM and were greeted quickly and cordially. We were seated within five minutes. The atmosphere was very nice, quiet and our table fairly private. The wait staff were attentive and knowledgeable. I mentioned my vegan requirements and suggestions were quickly made to accommodate me.  The food presentation was great. Plating was clean and simple, food looked great. But the best part of the taste and quality of the food. It was perfect in every way. Spices were exactly as ordered. Mine was modestly spicy. My table mate's was much hotter, as requested.   Vegetables were fresh, tender, cooked perfectly. The sauces were excellent. Our food was hot, but not too hot to enjoy immediately. Everything was delicious!  Prices were very reasonable and fair. Our overall experience could not have been better.  We both agreed that we would return to Blue Taj. And I would recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for excellent, authentically Indian cuisine and courteous service.",

    "text": "We went to Blue Taj after a movie, and I'm glad.  First, there is clever usage of heavy curtains to partition off sections- it creates a very intimate setting to not see the entire restaurant from your seat. I have no idea if there were 20 tables or 200.  The host and hostess at the door were warm and friendly, and our server was engaged as well.  There is an extensive wine list which surprised me, but I just ordered a glass, and my friend ordered a Kingfisher beer. My wine was a generous pour.  We started with a cauliflower app. It was a little more tomato-pasty than I liked, but the textures were varied and it still was pretty good. We also ordered the Cod, Saag Paneer, and garlic naan. We ordered everything medium heat, but it was not really hot at all, so next time I might try at least one dish hotter.  The naan was very good- warm and garlicky...yum! Unfortunately, the cod was quite overcooked and dry, which is why I didn't give 4 stars. Even the sauce it was served with couldn't save it.  I dont get to Ballantyne that often, but I'll keep Blue Taj in mind when I do. I'd like to try some other menu items.",

I asked for yogurt and the waitress said that she will check and let me know and I didn't even get any response. When I asked her again she said she didn't understand what I asked her for. The sheek Kabab or the lamb curry were empty the whole time I was there... I just have lot of things if I go on keep writing.. Please avoid going there for Indian food..

I would suggest just parking and asking someone where the restaurant is because you will never find it just driving around.....it's around the corner from Terrace Cafe. I loved the decor of this place and the service was grand. I started out with samosas which were good but I felt that there was an ingredient missing from the actual turnover pastry itself(not that I'm an expert on Indian food:-). I tried the Kerala Style Seafood which was very good, with naan and a salad......again, I felt there was something missing from the naan......I dunno, but I would like to try the Sunday buffet or dinner at some point. Overall, I think I like Copper better.",

    "text": "Today for Lunch: Dessert first!  Kulfi: Malai Kulfi: mmmmmmmmmmm.  Last time I had one before the meal and a second one before the entree.  Today I only had one.  Kulfi is a Frozen Indian Dessert and few places in Charlotte have good Kulfi (Copper has Three).    The Blue Taj makes their own (many places do not) and it is Fantastic!!!  This Malai version is: Rich and creamy flavored with Saffron and Rose water.  I'll Guess the other ingredients (Sugar, Almonds, Pistachios, Heavy Cream)?  Fantastic!  Next a Very Special Salad (so special I spell it Zalad) called Kachumber - This is a simple dish with simple ingredients when mixed offer a wonderful experience:  Here's the breakdown of this amazing salad: Cucumbers, Tomatoes, RED Onion (red is a plus for me), Lime juice, Cilantro and a mix of Spices called Chaat Masala.  Chicken Jhalfrazie: Chicken breast and thigh cut into chunks, sauteed with carrots, ginger, onion, red and green bell peppers, simmered in a zesty tomato base sauce.  This is very good and my third time having this dish. It is quite filling served with Basmati rice and Naan bread though not anywhere as heavy as Tikka Masala.  So I think this is a dish many will enjoy especially in the summer.  I prefer the taste of Tikka Masala though the Jhalfrazie is a great dish and change from the usual!  I ordered it medium spice level and it came out perfectly!  Each course was timed perfectly and the service was fantastic!  They remember where I like to sit and ask if I would like the same table I had the last two visits - Amazing!  About half the restaurant was full at lunch time today (a Monday)!  They play so cool Indian Music - all Modern, all upbeat, some Techno - Yeah!!! Today was my 9th Dine at the Blue Taj.  Chicken Tikka Malsa is one of my favorite Dishes (out of ALL Cuisines and Restaurants) and this is one of the BEST!  Tikka Masala is a \"Gateway\" Curry!  Yeah!  Your Sun will be Brighter on the cloudiest day!  Ahhhh!",

We really enjoyed the mix of styles , but I was in the mood for indian. Everything was made from scratch, even my chai soda, which was awesome. What we ate: Peri Peri Cauliflower, apricot thyme tandoori bread, Norwegian Salmon, Chiken new deli style (which is the best tikka masala I've had in Charlotte), and a mango moose cake. I wanted Chai tea so they made me some from scratch off the menu.  I really appreciated that touch.  Execellent all around, but if you have something against indian or asian food you probably won't appreciate it.",

SO i went in expecting to be disappointed because come on ...Im indian and a pretty bad ass cook.  But to my shock this place was REALLY good and had unique stuff I'd never seen in any Indian restaurant before.  FIrst and foremost was the fact that it had specialty indian inspired cocktails. If you frequent indian restaurants you'll know that the drinks menu is usually not very extensive if even in existence at all.  So we got two cocktails that were not only good as \"indian cocktails\" but I would Truely rate them as some of the best cocktails Iv ever had....sadly I cant rememebr what the were called and even looking back at the menu now they dont have them list! ARGH!! Im starting to sound like an alkey! so ONTO the food dang it... we got chatpate tikki chole as the appetizer, he was skeptical as it was vegetarian....but i told him that doesnt matter with indian food! And boy was i right cuz it was sooo yummy we practically licked the plate.  For dinner we got chicken makhani and lamb curry with some rice and naan. I know boring but it was his first time trying indian food (double gasp!!! - he was dating an indian chick the situation needed to be rectified ASAP). ok back to the food.... it was excellent and very good portions of everything. We had to take some home, mainly so that we could still get dessert ;) We got a tried and trusty Gulab Jamun and it was exact yummy finish that was necessary to such an awesome meal.",

I recommend the sweet lassi (I'm sure the other flavors are great as well). It was a little pricey for what we got but still a great spot to go to if you are craving (North) Indian food.",

    "text": "Maybe we were there on a bad night?  Our first time there, and it was so highly recommended.  It was crazy busy, no problem.  We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks while waiting for our table.  When our table was ready we closed our bar tab and went to the table.  It was insanely warm...like sweat dripping down our backs warm.  Our waiter was very nice and made recommendations. The waiter kept stopping by our table and apologizing and saying \"only 5 more minutes...\".  It took well over an hour to get our food.   Finally it arrived and while it was not bad, it certainly was not great.  Definitely not better than the much cheaper take out we usually order.  Then came the bill.  My husband noticed the drinks we had at the bar were on our table bill, even though we paid the tab at the bar.  My husband explained this to the waiter.  He then comes back with the manager who demands to see the receipt.  My husband pulls out the receipt to show him...it was very embarrassing.  Finally he agrees to take it off the bill.    Then, my husband hands the waiter his credit card to pay.  The guy comes back and hands it to my husband.  There is no place to sign.  When asked, he said it was because it was a \"reprint\" due to the drinks mistake.  My husband asked \"ok, but it's paid right?\" He says yes.  We leave.  We get halfway to our car and get chased by the waiter who says we have not paid our bill!  Granted...there is some language barrier here...but was hugely embarrassing.  The waiter was very polite and apologized over and over but the whole experience was pretty awful.    Between the heat, the mediocre food, and being embarrassed not once, but twice...I doubt we go back.  Two stars because the waiter was friendly and the appetizer was good.",

We crashed and burned on our first choice and thought about The Blue Taj.  Ballantyne Village was hoppin and we didn't think we'd get in on this chilly night.  We walked in and were asked if we had the dreaded reservation.  I pretty much figured we were going to have to drive down to Showmars at this point but were ushered to their outdoor seating area which was awesome.  They had these heaters on and it was like we were dining in Tahiti!!!  We started off with the vegetarian appetizers which had samosas and other stuff that I couldn't really identify but they were all good.  They had a homemade sauce served with them which couldn't have had any more flavor!  YUM.  I had a lamb dish suggested by our waiter which was both full of flavor and had just the right amount of heat.  Sweetie had a shrimp dish that she enjoyed also.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of the dishes, but just going off the recommendations of the waiter we did really well.  Oh, I forgot the NAAN, holy crap get the Garlic Naan.    Service was a team effort and we stayed taken care of the entire night.    Great experience and We'll add The Blue Taj back into the rotation",

We requested some tamarind chutney and the waiter finally brought it out. When we got the bill, they had charged $1.99 for a tiny amount of chutney. We complained because the waiter never mentioned there would be an additional charge but he said it was out of his hands. It's a shame...the customer service used to be much better.",

I have had Indian cuisine in several cities and countries around the world, and have never been as happy with my meal as I am at The Blue Taj.

I usually order Chicken Tikka Masala because it's so good, every time I think I want to order something else, I come back to it.  It really is THAT GOOD.

It was dry and hard, not the type of quality you expect from a such a fine dining restaurant ! I was worried as I had already ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala for our entree and onion paneer naan bread and the quality of paneer was the same in both. To add to our woes, it was bland ! The cocktail drink we ordered with our appetizer took ages and finally I asked the waiter to cancel it.  Il not recommend anyone to come here considering  the price we paid for our experience !",

The waiters and hosts are cordial and treat you very well. They help you to make a decision based on what you would like if you're indecisive and will make adjustments to the food/type of meat/level of spiciness as needed. They usually make good recommendations for new things to try and accompanying wine as well. The food is always delicious. The portion sizes are respectable when it comes to your meal. A little small with the appetizers. But the food is consistently flavorful and filling. We usually get some version of chunks of chicken in the various delicious sauces (i.e. Chicken tikka masala), garlic naan, rice and a nice white wine.

Blue Taj is located in the back part of Ballantyne Village, where there used to be a pizza place. The interior has been modified to be more Far East themed, but with a modern twist. In particular the space has been carved up into 'rooms', some which work better than others. Unfortunately, for those sitting by windows or outside, the view is of the Ballantyne parking deck and the dry cleaners. . .  Service was inconsistent - long waits for service and food, but interspersed with really positive interactions with our waiter. In particular he was very good in explaining some of the menu options and also upselling the Sunday brunch buffet, which sounds like a great deal ($12.95 pp)!  We ordered a fairly typical Indian meal - Chicken Tika Masala, Saag Paneer, Chicken Vindaloo, Raita and two different Naan's (plain and Pashwari). Overall, the quality of the food is excellent - top notch ingredients, well spiced and not greasy (a common problem with Indian food that isn't prepared carefully). While the standard spice level is mild, if you ask for hot you will get it. I was especially impressed with the Saag Paneer, the cheese was homemade and I'm fairly certain the spinach was fresh.   Regarding the Naan - it was fluffy and crispy, a great contrast. I LOVE Pashwari naan and this didn't disappoint. We did not have desert (opted for frozen yogurt later).   My biggest concern with Blue Taj is the pricing - simply put, the cost per dish is fairly high for what it is and the size of the order. Perhaps I am biased, having eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants throughout the world, but the price points ($13-$16 per dish) seem high given both the market and competing Indian restaurants. I suspect the owners are pricing based on what the market used to bear when the economy was better versus what the reality is today.   As a result, I recommend this restaurant for the occasional date night meal, but not for regular visits or takeout.",

The place is located in the Ballantyne Village, but it's a little hidden in the back under the escalators. There is some outdoor seating but it faces the parking garage. It was also pretty dark inside, which if I was on a date, may have been ok, but for a business lunch, the mood didn't need to be set :)   All the lunch entrees were under $10. Ordered the popular chicken tikka masala, which came with soup/salad. The salad didn't sound interesting, so I went with the the coconut tomato bisque. It had great flavor and set the stage for me. The entree came separate with rice and the tikka masala. The tikka masala was good, but not great. My only issue was that the flavor of the soup and the entree were so close (red cream sauce) that it felt like a continuation of the soup with some change . May not make sense, but a different soup choice would be nice especially since the tikka masala is so popular.",

    "text": "This is our favorite spot for Indian food in Charlotte.  We used to live in London and had top notch Indian there regularly, so our expectations our high.  I know everyone says Copper is the best, but I have always had bad service there and just don't think the food is as good.    The lamb chop here is great.  It's a main course item though, so if you are trying to get curries and dishes for the table to share,as is customary with Indian restaurants, just know that.  We love the tikKa masala and the korma is great too.  We always get the garlic naan and raita to go with everything.  It's great for take out.  The restaurant itself is comfortable and the decor is a little funky, the service has always been good.  I havent tried their Sunday buffet but would love to.  It's always a great way to try new Indian dishes that you may not normally order.",

The Chicken Tikka Masala is a great entree. Try \"Indian hot\" if you want a bit of a kick. Their friendly staff remembers me and always makes me feel welcome. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Upon arriving at the Blue Taj, you are met with an ambiance that could be mistaken for a yuppie martini bar, with the fancy pastel lighting, weird fiberglass chairs and tables, etc. I usually steer clear of these types of places, feeling that they are trying to be too trendy and contemporary; This is where the management usually focuses their efforts on...form over substance, and the food is generally given a seat on the back-burner. And let's be honest, we are in Ballantyne, NC...not LA, NY, or Miami. However, we were here, and hungry, so I decided to put my misgivings aside and dive on in.   Turns out, my initial worries were quickly laid to rest. The food was amazing and authentic. The Tomato Coconut Bisque had the perfect blend of sweet, spicy, and salty...my three favorite culinary attributes. For the main course, my wife chose a safe bet...Chicken Tikka Masala, which she said was out of this world. Me, being a little more daring, went with the Lamb Vind Alho (sp?). The rich spice in this dish was amazing...but at the same time, not the most overpowering, burn the roof off your mouth, Vind Alho I've ever had, which was actually a pleasant surprise.   Service was great...run like a military operation, but with much more personality. Perfectly timed drink order, appetizer/entiree delivery, and check presentation. Our server took time with my wife (an Indian food first timer!) to explain certain dishes to her, even though he was clearly slammed on a busy Friday night.   Price is the only issue with this restaurant...it runs a little high for Indian food. If want to keep more of your hard earned greenbacks in your pocket, but want the same quality food, I suggest Cafe Nirvana, right down the street from Blue Taj...all the same great food, with half the pretense of a trendy hangout!",

We shared the Mango Chickpea Chaat appetizer which had a nice full flavor and for dinner had vegetable korma and shahi paneer. The korma was very good, not overly creamy but I preferred the shahi paneer probably because I'm a big fan of Indian cheese plus it had a delicate flavor balancing out the sweet (raisins) with the creamy, delectable sauce.   Just remember to order it according to your liking, i.e., mild, medium, spicy. I was expecting less and got way more than I bargained for in taste, atmosphere, and service.",

In fact, their chicken tikka and chicken tandi korma are absolutely delicious, make sure to get a 3 level spice if you can handle spice.   The best curry I had was in Mumbai based on a local friend's recommendation. That set a tremendous standard. I will say this, Blue Taj's curries have come very close to what I had in Mumbai. The curry was well-balanced, well-spiced, and appropriately flavorful. I know it has the same owners as Blue Taj, but it must be the chef or something because It's leagues beyond Copper in terms of authentic food quality and taste.  Truly the best Indian restaurant I've been to outside of India!",

Right from the moment we stepped into this restaurant his behavior was rude and unacceptable. Being an Indian he took us for granted and was not bringing our beverage for at least more than 10 minutes. This behavior is totally not accepted considering the reputation of the restaurant.

You can order the dishes in the spice level that is personally preferred.  The cauliflower appetizer is delicious.  I had never had anything like it.  The sauce is so flavorful and full of dimension.  The chicken tikka masala is the best I have ever had.  I order it at the spice level 3- which is spicy yet tolerable.  The garlic naan is the best to soak up the leftover sauce.  It has diced garlic on it to add more flavor to the already flavorful meal.  I do not think anything ordered would disappoint.  The staff are very friendly, great at suggesting wine pairings, and overall  very genuine.  The atmosphere is casual  with a soothing ambience.  The lighting is dim, there is music playing softly, and the decor is clean and trendy.",

It was absolutely worth the drive and the extended time on the babysitter clock.   The biggest shocker of the evening for me was that this restaurant is the sister restaurant to Copper. What? How did I miss the memo? I am not a fan of Copper - too fru-fru for me when I just want good, authentic Indian. The Blue Taj is the answer to that problem. Delicious food. Traditional dishes. Optional spiciness... everything I miss about my favorite Indian restaurants back home in Boston.   We enjoyed everything we ate ... cucumber salad, samosas, naan ... for starters ... chicken tikka masala and a delicious scallop dish for the entrees. We devoured our rice and our server promptly refilled it. Love that. I can't wait to go back and try some more dishes!",

    "text": "Blue Taj, I have waited for a year to find you here in Charlotte, and now I feel more complete.   I've always thought the best Indian restaurants are in Boston, where I went to college and where my in-laws live.  But no more.    The decor is dark but bright and uber-modern, and frankly I wasn't sure if this was one of the more overrated restaurants that's all about decor, and rate low on taste.  Instead, the food is seasoned extremely well, prepared authentically, and the servers are very helpful explaining any unfamiliar menu items.   I highly reccommend getting the appetizer sampler (vegetarian or meat) which is tiny, but just right to get a taste of many of their starters.   Instead of ordering the usual chicken tikka, I asked my server what he recommended, and I ended up with a delicious shrimp, scallop and fish in a curry-coconut spice sauce...divine!   The nan here is puffy, tender and crisp in the right places too.  Our server explained how he likes to get it out at the right time so it's served fresh and hot like it should be.   My husband's kabob medly too was some of the best tandoori chicken I've ever had.  Not tough and overcooked like other white chicken dishes, but just right.    For dessert, we took some gulab jamun to go, which were tiny balls of dough, soaked in a honey syrup.  It was ok, but a nice ending to a large meal.   Service: The first time we went, it was ultra slow, but the second time, we asked for expedited service so I could get back to work, and our server was spot-on and got us in and out of there in about an hour.   Can't wait to go back!",

The appetizer (chaat) had cold potatoes, served with various generic cold chutneys which had a bottled aftertaste. The butter chicken was swimming in a thick sauce which was obviously old (cream was curdling and tasted rancid), the chili chicken was not spicy and drenched in oil (I'd suggest the chef goes over to Cafe Nirvana a couple of miles down the road to see what chili chicken should taste like), the dessert was a sooji halwa (cream of wheat with butter, sugar and raisins) often considered a poor man's dessert in Indian circles and never served in restaurants, and a sad looking chocolate souffle of some sort which had not set.   Disappointing, to say the least. If you want better Indian food, try Cafe Nirvana down the road, or Woodlands, or Fu Lin (for Indian hakka Chinese). If you want less expensive Indian food, try any other Indian restaurant in Charlotte except Copper, which is owned by the same person.",

    "text": "Unexpected flavors. Wonderful service. I'm not a big fan of Indian food but they definately showed me what a great Indian meal can be. The Naan with garlic and butter was to die for. The meal (veggies in some type of cream cashew sauce) was delightful. The host helped guide me and he was a joy. The dessert was a sampler with some type of mango pudding, a frozen spicy dome (my least favorite), rice pudding and a \"donut.\" I am so glad for the experience. The ambiance was warm, friendly and relaxing. There was outdoor seating and a band was playing. Too loud for my tastes but others might love it.",

Our server,Harvin, took such great care of us (heck everyone did).  I asked about Vegan options and they had heaps! I went for vegs in a coconut ginger sauce. Husbae had chicken marsala. Both were delicious!  Like I'll be dreaming about your food good!  Thank you for being so kind serving us delicious food!",

Despite having the address and Google maps, we couldn't find it. I had to call as we were walking aimlessly around. It's underneath the theater far in the back corner.   Service was prompt and efficient. Not sure it was due to the fact we were there early and the only ones there or if that's typical. We started with the masala-chili cauliflower florets which were quite good. Had better but these were good. The menu is more limited than many other Indian restaurants but adequate. It's also a little pricier than most by a couple bucks per entree. It's rare to see entrees priced at $15-17 but here it's normal.   I had the chicken mehti curry extra spicy and it was quite good with great spice level. My wife had the scallops which were terrific. I'd recommend them.   Atmosphere is cute for a strip mall environment and the food is worth the trip.",

They are super busy so plan on a reservation or waiting for a table. We had a reservation but they were packed so we waited about 10 minutes for our table at the bar.  It worked out because we were able to eat outside and it was a perfect fall evening. Parking is in the garage nearby and it's usually easy to find parking.",

    "text": "Where have we been to have taken so long to find The Blue Taj.  It is cleverly hidden behind the movie theater in the Ballantyne Village shopping center that has the tower thing and Mellow Mushroom.  At the junction of Ballantyne Commons and Hwy 521/Johnson Road.  We went for lunch and here was the conversation with my wife:  wife:  This is wonderful               me:  munch, munch wife:  The naan is exceptional    me:  slurp, slurp wife:  These sauces are delicious and unusual      me:  gobble, gobble glump, glump  To say the least we were very impressed.  This just ain't the chicken curry and tandori chicken joint so regularly found in town.  Taj is classy, serves unusual sauces and combinations that we have not found around. It is pricier, but the unusual offerings make up for the price.    The lunch menu had one choose from appetizers, which included an excellent tomato soup flavored with coconut, and then you could go with an express lunch or regular lunch.  Express offered 5ive sauces, so pick one, then what meat or veggie you wanted with it.  Included were rice (and a decent portion it was), naan (we got a basket with four wedges of it) and dessert.  Other than the express one could choose delicious entres which also came with rice, naan and dessert.  Wife had leek kofta which was croquettes of potatoes and leek with cashew tomato sauce.  Scrumpcious in all respects.  I had the methiwaala korma consisting of chicken chunks in a creamed cashew and onion sauce with fenugreek.  Ummmm...got you with fenugreek, eh?  Fenugreek is a mild form of tarragon.  The sauce was so flavorful that we never found our socks that got knocked off!  It was so flavorful, dotted with little bits of leaves and seeds and spices that each mouthful (amplified with chunks of chicken with rice or naan or all of it together) had your tongue serving as a  dance floor for on which the flavors danced.  When we mentioned this wonderful sauce on checkout, two of the wait staff smiled and hardheadedly agreed that it was also their favorite sauce.  You might not be able to pronounce it, but the wait staff knows what you are asking about.  We concluded that this is the best Indian restaurant we have found to date in Charlotte.  May the search continue, with many stops back into the Blue Taj.",

I noticed the last time I was in there that one of the girls took the fork I was using for my appetizer right out from underneath me as we were still eating -and I snatched it right out of her hand. I think it's rude to assume that people are done eating and try rushing them. Maybe ask patrons if they are finished before taking their dishes and flatware? Another thing that should be fixed are the chairs. Oh. My. Word. I cannot tell anyone how annoying the chairs are. I feel like if I bring my chair out from under the table to sit in it everyone starts to stare at me or something -they are so loud! I would suggest putting something like felt pads under the legs. Other than that, I think everything is good. The food is great, the decor is pretty, the manager is awesome. Oh, and I suggest making a reservation to anyone who wants to get a table for dinner.",

(one of the servers was joking  when i was telling him about similar taste in multiple dishes--he said \"this is the gravy made this week; try coming next week and you might get different tasting gravy\"!!!!); good and attentive service staff though whenever we go for dinner but gets very loud at busy periods. malai kulfi is their asset and so is shahi paneer (we sort of go there just to eat these two things).",

I ordered the chicken tikka masala both times and was not disappointed either time.  The chicken itself is tender and flavorful, but the sauce is unbelievable!  The service is somewhat interesting, and the only drawback.  The first time, I went with a female friend and was basically ignored.  She had superb service, but it was as if I wasn't even at the table.  She had to basically order for me!  I am just gonna chalk that up to my dinner guests distracting beauty. The next time I went, I was not ignored at all, and the wait service was adequate, a little slow with the check but overall friendly and helpful.  The strange part of the second visit was the wait to be seated.  We went on a Friday and had no reservation, but I counted literally 15+ open tables that remained open the entire 20 minute wait time to be seated AND the entire time my guest and I were actually eating.  I can understand waiting and can be patient if there are no tables open, or if there are actually a lot of people coming in with reservations, but come on, 15+ tables that remained empty the entire hour and a half including WAIT TIME?  The food is worth the hassle of the service, I just hope maybe they read this and do something about the problem.  I definitely will be visiting again though.",

    "text": "I went with four other co-workers to try this place out at lunch.  We arrived at around 12:30.  First off, when we arrived, the lady at the front was working on ringing up some checks she looked up & told us she would be right with us.    We thought it was a bit odd that she left us all standing there awkardly while she continued to ring up at least 5 checks.  Tick-tock, tick-tock... we felt our lunch hour creeping by as we waited to be seated.  There were plently of available tables, so that wasn't the problem...  but, finally we got seated.   I tried the tomato-coconut soup, which was good... but as Todd points out, if you end up getting the chicken tikka masla, the flavors are much the same. It would have been good to have another selection for the soup.   I did order the chicken tikka masala which comes with a little side serving of vegetables (in a separate bowl) that looked a little mushy and over-cooked, but actually tasted good.   The basmati rice was served in big bowls for everyone to share.  I thought the chicken tikka masla was average - not the best I have ever had, but not the worst either.   They didn't bring the naan out until our entrees were served. It would have actually been nice to get that up front along with the soup/salad course. The naan was delicious -  hot,fresh, and tasty.   At the end of our meal, they brought out a rice pudding for everyone. It was tasty but by this time, I think everyone was really too full to enjoy it.   The biggest problem during our entire visit was the slow and sluggish service.  Also, we were not pleased that our waiter brought out one check.  When we asked for separate checks, he was too lazy to do it properly and asked if he could just split it 5 ways. I didn't really appreciate that, but went along with it just to get out of there.   Overall, I thought the food was pretty good but found the service to be sub-par.",

Spice level was wrong, it was for my lunch guest & that happened all lunch. When I said something to the server he ofcourse said that I ordered it that way. I had to remind him that wasn't so and that from the 1st course our orders were incorrect. He must have been new because he had no customer service skills. From telling us he wasn't our server at first but then taking our order to literally forgetting about us.  No  one checked on us at all.

    "text": "This is only the second time I've had Indian food let me start off with that. But, the food taste and quality was AMAZING! I'd only previously eaten at a great little Indian restaurant in NYC and that was phenomenal, but ,my only point of reference.  I'm happy to say that The Blue Taj was equally as impressive. Everything from the service level to the food's taste/quality to the ambience was top-notch. Our waiter was extremely helpful in answering our food-related questions and even made a few recommendations - both of which were spot on!  For an appetizer we shared the Chatpate Tikki Chole which are potato patties on a bed of seasoned chick peas with wonderful sauce poured over, with a crunchy flat bread to top it off. The flavors were wonderful and the potato patties were very well cooked, soft and flavorful.  Next up were the entrees. My wife ordered the Saag Paneer, which is one of the many vegetarian dishes they offer. Sauteed spinach and cream sauce cooked until it's almost like a porridge with chunks of homemade paneer (soft white cheese) which is flavored with fenugreek and is savory in every bite. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala, mild, and I was in love! The chunks of white meat, cooked to perfection in a bowl with the Masala sauce poured over stewing away with all those amazing middle eastern spices....my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  Both entries come with Basmati rice which is as delicious & flavorful as it is aromatic. Additionally, I recommend to anyone reading this to ask for an order of Garlic Naan. Naan is a flatbread that is fire-roasted and served up warm. The garlic version kicks it up a few notches, especially when you dip it into the variety of sauces served with each entree, it's to die for!  Finally, feeling extremely full but wanting to have a little something sweet, for dessert we ordered Malai Kulfi. Essentially this is Indian ice cream that is homemade with Saffron and Rose Water and is very creamy. I wasn't too impressed at first since it was still a little too cold to eat, but as it slowly set to room temperature, I was able to appreciate this as the perfect compliment to an Indian meal, especially since some dishes can vary in spiciness from none to extremely hot. The cream-base helped to dull to flame from the Tikka Masala and the honey-like flavor was a nice end to an incredible meal.",

The restaurant is divided into sections, one is dark with pink and orange sheer curtains, a small dining room off to the side has stark white tables with blue chairs and tiny blue glass bread plates, the dining room in the back is dark wood with green chairs and green glass plates.  I thought about changing some plates around, but decided not to aggravate the nice waiters.  Service is stellar and very pleasant.  I think the great service is going to carry them.  The food is very good, I am so bad, I ordered the chicken tikka masala, just like I order at Copper!  It is so yummy.  If you like heat, make sure you remember to tell them spicy.  I think it is pretty tame unless you specify!",

The basic concept of Indian hospitality is to treat every guest to the best, whereas the concept for this restaurant seems to revolve around ignoring the indian customers and ensuring all their white customers are provided with all the attention. Make your pick if that's the business you want your dollars supporting. The owner should be ashamed at such a racist culture being the prevalent focus of this restaurant.",

Very delightful and would 10/10 come back again. Customer service was superb and we were never left without a drink.

    "text": "You will leave feeling blue and a little green.  The overpriced appetizer, the Tandoori Platter, consisted of two bite sized shrimp, two bite sized chunks of chicken and two bite sized pieces of, \"lamb.\" At 2.17 per bite, this was SO not worth it. The prawns were rubbery and fishy. We could not even cut them with the edge of our forks, that's how rubbery they were. The chicken was dry and flavorless, I left about $1 worth on the plate and the lamb was undetectable as lamb, tasting more like overboiled beef.  None of the delicious fatty, gamey lamb flavor.  No salt or pepper on the tables either so, could not help it with seasoning. The entrees we ordered were Lamb curry and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Two soup bowls were brought to the table and a dish of rice.  Again, my lamb very well could have been flavorless beef, there was no way to discern that it was actually lamb.  The sauce had a slight hint of coconut but, not much.  The chicken, likewise, was dry but, at least the sauce was a little better.  The naan had a good texture but, some portions had a fishy taste that had me worried the were handled incorrectly after handling seafood. To their credit, the fried bananas and ice cream was tasty and actually edible as was the Perrier. However, we were up for hours with nausea and stomach cramps.  My guess is those fishy prawns and the fishy naan. Save your money, find a recipe on the internet, and buy fresh ingredients to cook sanitary food at home.  What a shame this restaurant has such inflated prices and inflated ratings, so many people will be disappointed.",

It was such a good dining experience.  First off, this restaurant is so cute inside and has a great lunch OR dinner date vibe. I could take my mom here for post shopping lunch or my husband for a romantic dinner.   Second, the service is fantastic. The hostess greeted us warmly and seated us right away. Our water was constantly being refilled as soon as levels were low. Our waiter was very kind and helpful.   Third, the lunch is a great value! You get a salad or soup to start. I had the salad, it came with a mango dressing that was Devine. Then you get your choice of meat with your choice of sauce. I had the chicken tikka masala and it was fantastic. My mom had the curry goat and it was so tender. You receive a generous basket of naan with your meal. To finish it off, you get a dessert. I had rice pudding and my mom had a mango mousse. My meal was $10 and my mothers was $11. What a great deal!  I definitely plan on coming back!",

The funky coloring and design inside makes for a trendy environment. Everything I have eaten here has been delicious.  This last trip we tried the non-vegetarian appetizer platter that had a selection of tandoori meats. Everything on that platter reflected the wonderful light smoky flavor associated with the tandoori.   This time I decided to branch out and I ordered the tawa scallops and the waitress was kind enough to suggest the sauce pairing. The scallops were light and amazing! It was great to find such subtle flavor especially for someone like me who is still a novice with many of the spices used in Indian cuisine.  The other dish I usually get here is the chicken tikka masala which is the best I have found in Charlotte. The kitchen also has some great variety of naans if you order off the menu.   The experience here has always been great but I can't quite justify 5 stars for the price. You could order one chicken or vegetarian dish and a side of naan and be out over $20 before drinks.",

But if you park anywhere near Terrace Cafe, then follow the walkway to the right of it, it's right behind Terrace Cafe and the Escalators. You can also park in the Parking Deck and walk right up to it.   I came right after the lunch rush on a Tuesday so there wasn't a wait to be seated. The hostess greeted and seated me right away! I was also poured a glass of water immediately. I didn't need to scan the menu much because I already knew what I wanted but it's a pretty simple lunch menu with very reasonable prices. I ordered the Daily Express Lunch of House Spiced Curry with Chicken. He then asked me how spicy I wanted it which I thought was GREAT that I could use my own heat index. I said I wanted about medium heat spices and he understood. The Daily Express Lunch specials come with Naan and Rice with Soup or Salad. I opted for the soup of the day which was Tomato with Coconut Curry.  First up was my soup which came out quickly. First sip, melted my heart!!! It was absolutely delicious! Very smooth texture bursting with flavor and you can tasted all the herbs and spices in it. To be honest, I wanted more! My waiter came by and asked how I liked it, and I could barely look away from it to answer! Just as soon as I finished my soup, my lunch entree came out. A nice Bowl of the curry with just enough chicken, 4 pieces of Naan, and a large portion of Jeera Rice. I was pleasantly surprised!!! The Naan was soft and warm! I found myself dipping that in my curry as I ate. I'd never had Jeera Rice before but I loved it. It had a nice, light aromatic flavor cooked just right. Where it wasn't overly cooked and wasn't under. The curry was delicious! I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it but I just went with it and i'm glad I did! You could definitely taste all of the herbs and spices in it and they got my medium heat just right! I was so happy... then sad... because I got full only a few bites in lol.   Before I could ask, my waiter, whom had been very attentive and friendly the entire time, came and asked if I wanted a box, which I did of course! When he brought my box he explained how to box it. Was it necessary, no... but did I appreciate the extra concern to make sure I properly boxed my food to be able to enjoy it to it's fullest potential later.. DEFINITELY! He told me to pour my curry in the large section, the rice in both of the smaller section, and then take the bread with the paper holding it and place it on top. Great! No soggy bread here! He brought my check, I paid cash and I exited. Great meal at now my favorite Indian restaurant!!",

However, when go with a group and two of your friends are LITERALLY from India and they are ordering for you based on your tastes, you get to try some new things.  I hesitate to say this, but I actually enjoyed my dinner (don't tell my friend who for years, had to listen to me say how much I hate Indian food).  I ordered a glass of Pino Noir.  Pretty solid wine for $9.  Everyone else ordered an Indian beer that came in a huge bottle.  The cold glasses for them were a nice touch.  We had a bunch of apps, from cauliflower to a spicy shrimp/veggie dish to samosas.  The samosas came two to a plate and were shareable.  Next for dinner, I had a chicken dish that came in a bowl with a ton of sauce.  I am pretty sure it was the Chicken Makhani, which was more of a tomato based sauce.  Paired with rice and naan, it was delicious.  The most unique item was the cherry naan.  I would recommend this place to anyone just looking for good Indian Food...period.  They have a good size patio outside, and nice decor inside.  I'm not going to full on say that I love Indian food now, but Blue Taj has certainly changed my mind.",

We have so many options and choices up North that are awesome and once we got to the QC there were slim pickins for GOOD Indian cuisine.  We frequent Ballantyne Village for various restaurants like Terrace Cafe and Jade, one night we looked toward the back and noticed the sign. I pulled his place up on Yelp to bookmark and started reviewing the reviews and took a mental note. A couple of weeks later the hubby and I decided to go out for a date and that is when o suggested this place. I made reservations on OpenTable.  Upon arrival the hostess greeted is and was extremely pleasant. Once seated we noticed Indian families gathering and eating. My husband and I have a theory that if you are having a cuisine from a certain country and the natives of that country aren't eating it, that insist that the food is still good or authentic. Seeing this made us happy and the waitress was very knowledgeable.  We ended up with two dishes that the chef made up according to what we explained to the waitress that we liked :-) The sauces were full of flavor and the naan was fresh and flavorful. I look forward to our next visit.",

I didn't give it five stars because our table was so tiny the food plates had to overlap, giant plates, tiny table. Service was good, I had a very hard time hearing and understanding the waiter but he was very nice and attentive but not over attentive. Didn't feel at all rushed even though it was a busy Saturday night.",

The atmosphere was very upscale but still cozy, the food was delicious, but what really made it for us was the service.  We made a reservation which I would recommend, and the service was amazing from the moment we walked in until we left.   I wish we could remember our server's name but it was forever ago.  He was so helpful (which is why I would definitely recommend this place to anyone unfamiliar with Indian cuisine but curious) and even suggested a dish that wasn't listed on the menu.  It was quite possibly the most delicious entree I've ever had.  Ever.  The Blue Taj is definitely an excellent date spot, however they did have accommodations for large parties.  I would recommend this restaurant for just about any occasion that calls for awesome cuisine and super friendly service.",

I have been here as a party of 2, 4 and 8 on different occasions and I can't remember anything but stellar service. I will say that most of the wait staff may recognize me or even know me by now.  Our waiter usually makes suggestions and guides us through the menu based on what we are looking for that evening.  I have never had a bad meal here, but I do usually get the Vindaloo and I am up to 5 out of 5 spicy.   I really need to try different things on the menu for myself, but the wife and I usually get a vegetarian dish to share and each get a meat/protein entree, so I at least get to try hers. Always got to get naan bread to pick up all the sauces that come with the entrees and they give you all the rice that you need for the table.  We usually have enough left over from everything for at least lunch the next day.  I highly recommend Blue Taj for anyone looking for an Indian food fix.",

Indian food is one of constant top three favorite types of food (though don't ask me the other two, they're constantly rotating...) While it's far from the best Indian I've had, it's a relief such places exist in Charlotte.  I took my family here after Xmas, since most had never had Indian. Everything looked pretty good, but the Chicken Curry had a bit too much fenugreek flavour for my liking, and the chicken looked a bit dry. The Shahi Paneer was a bit too saucy (all the Paneer had crumbled, and didn't see signs of Cashews, which would have been nice). But when I asked them to make it \"Indian hot\" - they did. And it made my very happy.  Rankings      # of times dined here: 2nd     Cost of Bill incl. Tip: around $100 for 4ppl     Food Rating: 7/10     Service Rating: 7/10",

I still believe it's expensive, and may be not entirely worth the money you pay , but it's not complaint worthy. It's worth visiting at least once, specially since I haven't found or heard of any other good Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area.",

On my first visit, I started with a tomato and coconut bisque.  It was delicious: smooth, creamy, and just the tiniest hint of coconut under the tomato and spices.  It avoided overwhelming sweetness.  For my entree, I had saagwala.  It was tasty: tender lamb and good flavors.  I might order it spicier next time, though.  I specified a \"3,\" and it was pretty mild, although certainly not bad.  The interior is fun as well.  Red and blue contrast and various designs decorate the wallpaper.  The only criticism I have is that the waiter took quite a while to return our check.  He was apologetic when we flagged him down, but when you're on your lunch hour, you notice things like that.",

What I do is view deals on Groupon/Living Social and then read Yelp reviews to see if I should purchase them or not. The Blue Taj had mixed reviews, some complained of the spicy food, the crowds, the swanky design. Those who liked it lauded the food selection and price.  I took a chance based on this and wasn't dissatisfied! I visited during lunch, so it was not as crowded. Bim, our waiter made my friend and I feel as if we were the only ones in the restaurant. His service with a personal touch added to the ambiance. This is definitely not your normal Indian restaurant with good food but Big Lots decorations! It's tucked in the back under the theatre.....but once you enter it's like stepping into a new world. The food is good, not great. To be honest it's an amercanized version of Indian food.....so if you are an Indian food fanatic you have to request your food be made spicier. I had the Curry Salmon.....and my friend had the Mata Paneer(sp?) We were both statisfied with our dishes and LOVED our mango lasis! All in all a great place, great service and good food!

We came in tonight celebrating a family event, I made reservations for 4 people for 5:15 (cold and rainy day in Charlotte).  Before I start the review....for the love of all that is Holy..PUT SOME SLIDERS underneath your chairs...everytime someone moved their chair it sounded like nails across a chalkboard.  Service: At 5:05 we walked in..bar was open, one other table was seated, but hostess said they needed 10 minutes to get ready before we could sit as restaurant was not open.  My wife noted hey, it's freezing out there and instead of suggesting even waters at our table the hostess shrugged...we went to a different restaurant for a cocktail.  When we came back 15 minutes later, 4 tables were already seated.   We ordered a cocktail, and of course it was 15 minutes before we got it.  We were then given 3 menus, when we had 4 people .  We asked for a fourth menu and were asked why...your kids can share.  Really?  Even my kids were mad, their waters were never refilled, the waitress seriously grabbed the appetizer plates from underneath them mid bite.     Food: We had the Veg and non-Veg app, non veg was nice but overpriced....all the Veg was deep fried with little differentiation in flavor....  My wife ordered currry, and it looked like an oil slick...my lamb ven de alho was very good, except the rice they brought stuck together and looked like it was day old leftovers.  Both dishes were $17...again overpriced...and na'an was $6 even with 2 entrees.  I hardly ever give 5 stars, nor do I ever give 1 star...but what an incredible discrepancy.  Maybe I will try it again for lunch....but I will never come back for dinner.  My wife thought I was crazy for even recommending, and she is very easy to please.  I cannot remember a time when I just wanted dinner to be done with so I could get the heck out of a restaurant....  Net...food quality suffered tremendously, service was rushed and awful, food came out slow, ambience was incredibly bad....and $108 I will never get back.  Did I mention...PLEASE PUT SLIDERS ON THE CHAIRS...three Advils later and I'm still haunted by the noise!",

The complexity of the flavors, both meat based and vegetarian, was surprising.  The cauliflower gaat was fantastic.  The curry goat and another spiced lamb dish (the name of which escapes me) were very tender and spiced to perfection.  My only complaint was that the bartender poured an extremely skimpy glass of wine that tasted as though the bottle had been open for some time and the wine had soured. I knew the label so it was not the label itself.  Perhaps the bartender poured the last of an old bottle...anyway, I would avoid ordering wine by the glass there.",

Most likely because she had too many tables.    My beef, again, is with the hostess stand.  I've now commented on this twice and I see at least one more review with similar feedback.  This visit, the hostess seemed frustrated at our arrival.  I walked up to the desk and said \"Hello, I'm Zach, we have a reservation for 2 at 6:30\" to which the hostess replied while rolling her eyes \"Everyone has a reservation tonight.  Please follow me.\"  So not only was it an inappropriate comment, if I could fully interpret what she meant, but she proceeded to sit us at a table that had yet to be cleared and seemed bitter the entire time.   Provide some customer service training to the hostess staff and I'll most likely give this place 5 stars.",

    "text": "We tried the Blue Taj as takeout one night at a friend's house. I trusted their opinion because they're from the United Kingdom, where some of, if not the best Indian food outside of India can be found. I ordered the Korma (which I always order) and garlic naan. We probably ate our food an hour and a half or so after it had been cooked, Even still, it was delicious! This was the best Indian food I've had outside of England. My husband also feels the same way (he's from England). We've gone back many times since then (including for my birthday supper). I love the restaurant itself. Its got a great atmosphere and I thought the service was great! Love this place.",

    "text": "Holy lunch deal, Batman!  In an ornately dressed and dimly lit space, Blue Taj offers up a lunch special that is not to be missed! $9 for your choice of salad or soup, entree, rice and naan! And the best part is that it's super delicious and comes out fairly quickly - perfect for a work lunch! Here's how it went down...  1) Salad: 3/5: A small serving of bright greens with a strange but flavorful strawberry dressing. The dressing was a bit a la strawberry smoothie, but good nonetheless.  2) Chicken Tikka Masala: 5/5: Spicy, rich and creamy. Perfect with the complimentary rice. The big chunks of chicken are delightful and the sauce is filled with tons of flavor. Spice level three was a nice amount of heat, but nothing to set a fire to my mouth.   3) Naan: 4/5: Yeeeeah free naan. Four triangles between my dining partner and I. And it went very well with the tikka masala.   One other note...if you're headed to the restroom, be careful going around that corner! I almost smacked right into a server carrying a very full tray of eats. Moral of the story - hit up Blue Taj for a quick, tasty, and affordable lunch.",

The serving sizes are so small for the price, when they brought out the appetizers, I almost thought it was a joke! The interiors are okay, and are very un-Indian, so it feels different, rather than having Indian style art everywhere. I was impressed the first time I walked in. It feels like you are in a French restaurant or something. The last time I ate here, we wanted to sit outside because the weather was good. But we regretted our decision owing to their lights. I don't know who designed the place but the continuous yellow-red-green-blue lights are completely unnecessary. This is a restaurant, not a discotheque, you know! Another problem I have is with how snotty these guys are. I once dropped by 15 minutes before closing time and all I wanted was a drink (chai or soda, not a fancy drink), but the guy at the counter told me they were closed. Come on, there's still 15 minutes, what's the whole deal with making a chai? I'm Indian and I know how much effort it takes! Given the average taste of the food which is typical of Indian restaurants in the US, I wouldn't bother going out of my way for this place. I'd much rather pick up food from Bollywood Bites or just make it myself. It's just as good.",

I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first since it seemed like a swanky place, and that can sometimes be red flag #1, but also I was concerned because it was tucked back into what Brian F. fittingly dubs the \"doomed corner\" of Ballantyne Village. But this place is nothing close to doomed. Before I get into the dishes we ate and give my recommendations, I'll just cut to the chase and say it: this is the hands-down best Indian food I've eaten in Charlotte.   For our appetizers, my husband ordered the Tomato-Coconut Bisque, which was outstanding. Not being much of a coconut fan I usually don't like when I can taste it too strong in the cooking but there was the perfect amount of it in this soup. I went with the Mango Chickpea Chaat, a starter that was so out-of-this-world I want to make this the next time we have a party. It is a cold appetizer, with mango, potatoes and chickpeas tossed with onions and cilantro in a tangy tamarind-yogurt dressing. It was simple and packed with flavor, and surprisingly priced at $5.    For my entree I went with the Saag Paneer and on behalf of all of my tastebuds, you HAVE to try this dish. It was as if the Indian version of that girl from the Fiat commercial rose up out of the creamed spinach and slapped me in the face with a piece of paneer. Fan-TAS-tic! My husband got the Kolmino Patio, which was jumbo shrimp sauteed with spices and tamrind glaze and ginger. This dish was also great, but we both tried to play it cool as we fought over the Saag Paneer. Both meals came with rice, and we ordered garlic naan for dipping of course.   When we finally put down our forks we were so happy and full that we felt \"food drunk.\" We learned that the owners from Blue Taj also own Copper, which I could not believe - no offense to Copper, but while their food may be \"prettier,\" the taste and quality does not come close to Blue Taj.   Overall it was a great experience and we will be back for sure. The only thing I would do differently is to order only one main dish instead of two, since they definitely do not skimp on the food here.",

Here's what we normally order: -Kachumber Salad -Tossed house salad -Seared Tawa Salmon (salmon and roasted veggies with an amazing creamy red sauce which I normally order on the side. They have a tendency to slightly overcook the salmon so you may ask for it a little more rare if that will bother you.) you can also do this dish with scallops which are great too. -Chicken Methi Korma (2 spice level) -vegetable korma (sometimes we order this) -garlic naan -or the naan with potato inside  Great food and great prices. Service is usually pretty good depending on your server. Sometimes things can lag a bit. The chairs are a bit noisy which can get annoying if you arrive early and you have to listen to the place fill up with patrons. With that said, the beautiful decor, great food, and great prices should be more than enough to keep you coming back again and again.",

The first time we went to Blue Taj was for Valentine's day dinner 5 years ago, it was my first time eating Indian. I let the server know that I had never had Indian and have no idea what to order, he asked what kind of meet I like, I said seafood, he said I got you... He got me when he called \"seafood Miti Korma\", which is not even on the menu, and it was the best thing I ever had. I actually order the same thing every single time, while my wife has tried all their chicken entrees, loved every singe one. The service is a hit or miss, would be nice if they can work on that. The servers themselves are not bad, they try really hard, but every time we get a new server I get the feeling that they are not trained properly and they are setup to make mistakes, so I hope management takes note of that. By now we have tried pretty much every indian restaurant in town, and none compare to Blue Taj, not even close.",

They've done well with a small space.   Service: 3.5 Our server was very nice and attentive. The hostess seemed entirely uninterested in helping us however so we waited a while before she even spoke to us, kinda strange since we were standing right in front of her.   Appetizers: 3 Your standard indian appetizers, nothing special.   Main course: 3 We ordered 2 dishes. They were unmemorable and made us regret spending as much as we did for the meal overall. Just very uninspired cooking and not as flavorful as most other places we've been.   Probably will give it one more shot simply because it's a great vibe, but the food needs to hit the mark next time or we're done with them.",

The good:  lots of veggie options (including several I hadn't tried before, and the most amazing cauliflower), spot-on flavors, quick replacement of empty buffet dishes, and very tasty naan.  The could-be-better:  expensive for a Sunday lunch, an awkward set-up, making it difficult to carry a plate and bowl at the same time while navigating back to ones table, no saag paneer on the day we visited, and tip added to parties of 5 or more.  For delicious, authentic Indian food, the Blue Taj nails it. For pricing, service, and logistics, there's a little more work to be done.",

I informed the waiter that I am accustomed to eating very spicy food and requested 4 stars, reassuring him that I would not send it back for being too hot.  It was cooked perfectly, and the meal was outstanding.  Today I returned for lunch and wanted to try the vegetarian biryani (also four stars for spice).  The lunch menu stated it came with choice of soup or salad, and a piece of naan.  I reminded the waiter to ensure the food would be served spicy enough just as I had on my first visit.  I got the soup first, and the biryani arrived seconds later instead of waiting for me to finish my soup.  The biryani was VERY mild, not even close to four stars of spice.  The waiter had the cook add more spice, but it was still too mild.  The dish had ONE piece of cauliflower and only TWO pieces of broccoli, a few peas, and a bit of onion.  I felt like I paid for a bowl of seasoned rice.  It was very very poor quality biryani.  There was not enough spice and no where near enough vegetables.  Furthermore, they did not bring the naan.  When I informed the waiter, he said it didn't come with it, but it said on the menu it did.  Upon pointing it out, he did have fresh naan brought to our table though we were nearly done with the meal.  Needless to say I was very disappointed.  The first meal was so good that I was truly shocked at the difference in quality this visit.  I don't know if I will return again.",

It seems they are not able to seat just one person without difficulty. After a short conference that involved 5 of the staff I was seated at a small table for 2. Since it was Sunday, they had the buffet. I got the Chole with some samosas, mint chutney and raita. For my second plate, I selected vegetable saag, curried prawns, a piece of tandoori chicken and minced lamb kebobs. I was not awed by the selection. VERY limited. The quality of the food was simply not good. I felt as if I had gone to a golden corral. No spice, nothing tasted fresh, it was just not Indian food. There was absolutely no heat in any dish, there was no subtlety of flavor, everything was just completely bland. The Highlight of my meal was the fact that not a single person came by my table to bother me. I had to get up and snag a lady who was cleaning a table to ask her if i could pay for the meal. I went back to the table and waited. After giving my card, the wait staff left and took approx. 8 minutes to bring my ticket. The inflated price was 19.47!!!!! If you want bland tasteless food with no service please feel free to waste your money. For my part, I will find another place to go.",

I can understand $15 for curry goat, being that it's meat and not a common meat compared to cow, pig or chicken. I will not be returning unless it's for buffet or if I have a coupon.

Called to ask was last seating was and the owner/waiter (Vikranth)  says 9:30 pm and kitchen closes at 9:45. We got there at 9:28 as we wanted to eat a quick Indian meal for dinner. He says - that they don't follow Apple iPhone universal Time and he uses his own time and so it is already closed. So we had to argue our way to get seated. So for future customers - just be warned that this man is the self proclaimed leading authority of Cesium time clocks and will follow his own time schedule and as a customer you mean nothing to him. They think this is India and the behavior of the owner/waiter is pretty much equitable to Mumbai Slum street vendors.   Now moving to the food : we ask about Mango Chat and the owner/waiter says it's pretty good. We ordered it - it was stale old food. He noticed that we didn't it eat and then he himself declares that this item is terrible and he doesn't like it and not sure why it's on the menu. This man said he is the owner and then he is NOT sure why this nasty item with a beautiful sounding name is on the menu. Maybe he is not the owner or maybe he shouldn't be the owner if he can't figure out his own menu. Wonder what the kitchen is like - should probably vote this place for \" Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen nightmares \" TV show.   Next professionalism : apart from the rude behavior, this owner/waiter needs to look at himself in the mirror and tend to his attire properly. In a restaurant, wearing a dirty untucked shirt; the lower three buttons are open and we can see his lower tummy/hair - and this person is serving the food. Seriously - is this what an owner/waiter of the restaurant presents himself to the public ? Shows a lack of any basic decency.  So how much would one tip this person?  Good luck!",

I placed my order at approximately 8:55, and just walked out because no one seemed to know about it. The other reason I am writing this review is because the man at the front who was taking my order was constantly coughing. In this deathly flu season, someone unable to stop coughing is not who I hope to be exchanging credit cards or taking money. I ended up asking for a refund and am leaving without the Garlic Naan bc it no one knew about my order and I can't afford to spend more time waiting while is coughing. SN: I do fully recognize it is Valentine's night, but 30-40 minutes for a to go order of Garlic Naan is not a huge or complicated.",

My first week in town, an Indian colleague of mine suggested that I try The Blue Taj, and since moving here, my husband and I have been back The Blue Taj 4 or 5 times, if that tells you anything about how much we love it. Every time we think about trying a new restaurant, we end up going back to Blue Taj because we know it is amazing. Before trying Blue Taj, I liked Indian cuisine, but didn't crave it. Now, I am hooked. The Chicken Makhani paired with Garlic Naan is TO DIE FOR. The restaurant itself has a cool vibe, is clean and the waitstaff is excellent. I've never had to ask for a water refill or clean flatware. Five stars! I would even recommend this restaurant to those who aren't sure about Indian cuisine as they have many dishes that are great for 'beginners.'",

Food was out of this world! We had the fried-ish cauliflowe for an appetizer... excellent. Main course was braised Lamb and a Chicken Tikka Masala with a coconut sauce. To die for!!!! Definitely recommend, and WILL be going back!",

We have never had a bad meal there, and we've been dining there for years. When the weather is cooler, we enjoy  sitting on the patio which is nice and less noisy.   For appetizers, we love the the Vegetable Samosas,  Masala Chili Cauliflower Florets, and an order of their Dal and garlic naan.  Be sure to ask for the green mint sauce--wow is it good! Super flavorful!  Favorite drinks include the Karmic Bliss and \"Hazy\" Mumbai.    Favorite entree's include the Chicken Makhni, Vegetable Korma and the Lamb Curry.  If you are new to Indian food, try the Chicken Tikka Masala which is great, and the chicken pieces are huge and tender.  They have a great Sunday brunch, that allows you to try a ton of different dishes.  Sometimes they have great kheer (Indian rice pudding) and a dish of fruit and lightly whipped cream which is just the perfect way to end your meal.    Definitely a great choice for those new to Indian food, or folks like us, who just love it and could eat there once a week!  pk",

Ambience still nice, dark and candlelit.  Ordered chai masala and a mango lassi to start, and both were quite tasty, though the mango lassi could have a been a touch less sweet.  Paneer pakora was our appetizer.  This dish consists of chunks of paneer stuffed with spinach and fried.  It was ok, and the main \"taste\" was that of the mustard (cheese itself was bland).  Had lamb vindaloo, seafood Kerala, and garlic naan for dinner.  Seafood dish was good, and the cream curry sauce was tasty.  Lamb dish tasted like a lamb-filled pasta sauce - almost no kick, even though we asked for a four (out of five) on the spice scale.  Naan was good.  Nice that they included rice for free given that the dishes are quite pricey - we spent $53 before tip for the two of us.  All in all, decent food but overpriced.  Hopefully something better can be found in Charlotte!",

I started with a shrimp appetizer that wasn't on the menu.  It was drowned in this super oily red sauce that tasted like Ragu pasta sauce from the jar, but really oily.  For the entree, I had a lamb dish that was way too creamy and lacked the distinct Indian spices.  The worst part: the lamb didn't taste like lamb at all.  It sort of tasted like dried beef cubes.    I wanted to try a new place, which is why I came here.  Now I know that Bombay Grille in Pineville and Saffron at Arysley are two of the better places in Charlotte, for Indian food.",

That said,  when you order something so many times it is easy to notice if something has changed.   The last two times there was very little seafood in it and it was mostly sauce.   This was the least so far.   One scallop that was cut in half and two smallish shrimp and two very small one inch  pieces of salmon.  Given the price it was a problem, especially since it wasn't the first time.  My daughters goat and husband's chicken were more reasonably sized.   Four stars still for flavor though.  We ordered 5 on the spice scale.   We love spicy.  Mine was very spicy but perfect.   My husband's was very very hot and he was almost crying.   So beware!

I was in awe when I took my first bite of his dish and was envious throughout dinner lol. He shared his but I knew I had to finish my own. On out second trip, we both got the chicken tikka masala and was very happy. Their naan is the best naan i've ever tasted. So fluffy, moist, and crunchy toasty on the bottom. It was good! We had to order two so we could finish as much of the Chicken Tikka Masala sauce as possible. The staff was very attentive and kind. They'll always get good tips!

    "text": "Joke of an Indian restaurant - gimmicky and pretentious at best, which is probably why many Charlotteans starved of decent Indian cuisine think this place is awesome.   Today was my 2nd visit to the restaurant; first was a pick up order while today my wife and I decided to dine in without reservations.  At the front counter we expressed our interest in being seated outside - 2 out of the 3 ladies standing at the counter said ok/yes, while the third disapprovingly nodded her head and said \"no no, its too windy, no.\" I thought that came out a little rude specially as 4 tables were seated outside, so asked my wife if we should simply leave. She said we'll give it a try, so we agreed to be seated inside.  We then were ushered to a table for 2, right behind another couple who were comfortably seated. Instead of cramping behind them, I asked if it was ok to sit one more table down which was empty. She seemed unsure and said ok after I asked if it was ok twice, then continued to say that if they get a table for 6, they would prefer to use this table to join to the table for 4. I, once again, considered leaving, but was again told to give this place a chance.  The next group of 3 that came to the restaurant asked to be seated outside and were seated outside. What changed in 5 minutes?  Anyways - my wife read the menu in dim lighting and decided to order chili chicken appetizer and a karhai lamb extra spicy entree with onion paneer kulcha and 1 roti.   The chili chicken (4 tiny pieces in a huge, square plate) came out rubbery while the sauce was good. We had one piece each before deciding to wait for the entree.  The karhai lamb with kulcha, roti and rice were brought out to our table a few minutes later. I, once again, thought the gravy of the lamb curry was decent  - but neither of us could chew through even one of the lamb pieces. I have had enough lamb dishes from many different cuisines to know that this was probably how chewing on rubber feels like. We left the curry, all lamb pieces and rice untouched - we both had one piece each of the roti.  We did contemplate if we should speak with the manager, but decided against. I had just had enough and simply wanted to leave. I wonder why many of my colleagues rave about this place; even why yelpers rate this place highly - I can only attribute it to the lack of authentic, Indian restaurants in the area or being mesmerized by the dim, blue, gimmicky interior design of the restaurant.   Passage to India, Spice 9, Cafe Nirvana, Maharani Indian Restaurant are all better choices.",

We took two steps from the hostess podium and were seated.  (I told you it was close to the door.)   We received our entrees at 8:45.  We received the complimentary appetizer Naan bread soon after.  So...you tell me how our first experience was?  Our server did make sure our drinks were always filled, and the food (once it arrived, out of sequence, and all at once) was very tasty.   I had the Scallop Nilgiri Kurma (Sea Scallops simmered in a herb-spice paste flavored cashew curry sauce with scallions.)  It was green and flavorful.  I hadn't had scallops in such a long time and I was impressed that they were (for once) reasonably priced at a restaurant.    Would I go back?  Hmm...probably not.  I'm sure you can guess why.  I just don't have enough hours in the day.  We were glad that we weren't doing dinner and a movie that night.",

    "text": "My second visit to The Blue Taj was every bit as good as the first almost 4 years earlier. The food, drinks, and service are all exceptional.  I ordered the Hazy Mumbai to drink. It had such a unique flavor. I mean how often do you see cumin in a cocktail? The service was perfect...attentive, friendly, and the food came quickly.  My wife and I shared the lamb curry, chicken tikka masala, and daal makhani. The lamb curry was the star of the show. The lamb was incredibly tender and the portion was way more generous than expected. The chicken and daal were fine but somewhat paled in comparison.  The Blue Taj gets 5 stars because, whereas there may be a takeout joint or two with better Indian food, the service and cocktails make this place the total package.",

    "text": "Wow! This has got to be this best Indian food I've had so far. I absolutely love curry and The Blue Taj perfects the flavors and spices in all of their curry dishes. While some entrees can be pricer, you get your price's worth with the impressive and rich flavors of each dish.   First off The Chicken Tikka Masala ($16) was unlike any other chicken tikka masalas I've had before in the best way. The flavors and consistency of the curry and chicken were both spot on. The creamy tomato base was perfectly balanced with the chicken and rice. The lamb curry ($17) was also very tasty with a very bold flavor and cook on the meat. The vegetarian dish that my sister ordered called Marat Mushroom Corn ($15) was also amazing! My sister texted me a few days later saying \"I'm still thinking of that dish from the Blue Taj because it was THAT GOOD!\" There are tons of delicious and flavorful options for vegetarians as well.  LAST BUT NOT LEAST the Kerala Style Seafood Curry was EXCEPTIONAL. It was the best tasting seafood curry I've ever had and honestly probably the BEST curry I've ever had. It was perfectly balanced with the taste of seafood and spices as well as a very rich and intricate flavor. While at $21 it is a bit pricy it is 1000000% worth it because it is very delicious.  The Garlic Naan also paired well with everything as expected and our server was very polite and attentive. The restaurant is also beautifully decorated and has a very nice higher class ambiance. 10/10 one of the best eating experiences you can get in the Charlotte area.",

    "text": "Wanted to try a new place for our anniversary so we decided to check out the Blue Taj. We were there shortly after opening so we had the place to ourselves. Lovely interior with nice curtains, lighting and soft music playing in the background. We were seated promptly and given our menus. Not an extensive menu but that's okay as long as you do the few things you do well. The next thing we noticed were the high prices. Generally speaking, the food was on average 3 to 4 dollars higher than other Charlotte area Indian restaurants. They only offered one larger Indian beer (Taj Mahal of course) and it was 10 bucks! We always try to get a Gobi Manchurian app. and theirs was just okay. We could not ask for a spicier version (very surprising for an Indian restaurant) and the portion was small too. It had more of a chili/tomato base and less sweet than other places. No complaints about the rice or garlic naan. My main beef was with the entrees. Goat curry was simply the fattiest goat I have ever eaten. If I had to guess, my goat meat was about 60% fat. I showed this to the manager and he blamed the supplier, not the chef. But I'm thinking that if that's the case than you probably should change suppliers. Also a chef worth half his salt,wouldn't send that garbage out of his kitchen. Final gripe about this dish would be that I ordered it on a level 4 out of 5 and I didn't even break a sweat. Wife's Paneer Tika Masala usually comes with vegetables. Her version consisted of soggy paneer chunks and no vegetables in a way too mild sauce.  Service brought rating up to a 2 but we will not be back.",

Shrimp methi korma is my favorite and you can tell that they use good shrimp also. We usually get some kind of vegetarian dish also, like the kofta. The Masala naan is incredible if you can handle the spice. You can't go wrong with any dish at Blue Taj.",

I I loved the spice level at three which wasn't too hot. In fact, next time I might go with a 4 for a little more kick. Everything was great, but I have to say the Chicken Tikki Masala was my favorite. We had the Chili Chicken for the appetizer and it was solid as well. I would definitely recommend this for an authentic Indian experience.",

As we were seated and got comfortable it was actually pretty nice.  The arrangement makes each table feel pretty private.    We had an appetizer and two lunches which was a tremendous amount of food.  Neither my wife nor I were able to finish it all, even though we really wanted to.  My spicy chicken curry was phenomenal.  It had great flavor with a nice heat.  The rice was cooked perfectly and had a great aroma.  The Naan, oh my goodness was it good.  My wife's southern Indian curry was also very good.  I would either of them again without hesitation.  We really enjoyed our lunch.  The food exceeded our expectations and has ready for many return trips!",

Although much smaller than I had initially thought, the place is quite exotic and chic...as expected.  Also, I loved the fact that the place was well air conditioned.  From my past experience in Indian restaurants, bad AC was always an issue (for me).  Although I'm no connoisseur of Indian food, I thought their food was amazing.  From its Garlic Naan to the Chicken Tikka Masala, everything was fresh and well seasoned ...not to mention perfectly presented in stylish plates, bowls, even silverware!  Honestly, I think this might be the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to (though I haven't been to too many).  Considering I was with a group of 6, the service was good on the most part.  My waiter forgot to accommodate my request to bring my appetizer dish WITH the meal (not prior to), but he was fine otherwise, and the refill service was quick.  In short, both thumbs up!",

    "text": "Best Indian Cuisine in Charlotte!  For starters-you have to try the Masala Chicken Cauliflower (vegetarian, but so full of flavor you won't believe it's cauliflower...), and the Assorted NON-Vegetarian platter. The flavors of the grilled meats are OUT OF THIS WORLD. You'll be drooling about the dish every time you think about it in the future, I promise!   I have tried SO MANY of their dishes, as I always go with a group and share. My favorite? The Kerala Style Seafood-Jumbo prawns, scallops and fish stewed in a Kerala style curry sauce with coconut, spices and tamarind. So creamy, the seafood is so moist, the flavors robust... a nice heat and a little bit of sweet lingers in the background... this dish does NOT disappoint! I am pretty sure I have dreams abou this dish, I wish I could replicate it in my kitchen!! The first time I ordered, I got a 3. It was a WARM 3. The second time I ordered, I got a 2. It was a WARM 2. So-depending on how \"warm\" you like your curry, be warned.   The next favorite is an oldie but goodie, the Chicken Tikka Masala-which you can never go wrong with. Creamy & tangy curry goodness surrounding extremely tender chicken that will keep you going \"mmmmmmmmmm\" all night!  The best part about Blue Taj-is that if you have no idea what to order, your server will order you the perfect dish. Just ask for help-tell them what meat you want and flavors you know you like-or think you like-and they'll take it from there.   Don't forget the garlic Naan!  Great for groups-but you better be sure you call ahead or you'll be waiting quite a while. Take a group of your friends and share-it's the most fun AND you get to taste EVERYTHING!",

It was superb and for dinner I enjoyed  the Kerala  Style Seafood with just jumbo shrimp (*my preference) in a Kerala style curry sauce with coconut, spices and tamarind paired with garlic naan and aloo parathas, again delicious. Perfect place for a date, dinner with friends or a more casual business meeting. Love it! Will definitely try again.",

I've only had one disappointment there, and it was recently. I had to use the lady's room for the first time there and found myself in an unkempt, dingy, dirty room that was gross to use. How easy and inexpensive it would be to upgrade the bathroom, make it cheerful, clean the stalls (and toilets!). I was not able to continue eating my dinner after using the room. Had it wrapped up for another day. Such a nice looking restaurant with excellent food and service, a dirty icky bathroom that doesn't even live up to some of the roadside rest stops can affect business. Some cheerful colors, decor & a cleaning person would do wonders to keep this place on top Maybe most men don't care about these things, but most women do.",

    "text": "Last night was my third time at Blue Taj.  My only reference for Indian in Charlotte is Woodlands and Jaipur.  I convinced a few friends to drive down with me from Plaza-Midwood because I think Blue Taj is worth it.    We had the Paneer Pakora, Punjabi Chicken Curry, Lamb Curry and (of course) Chicken Tikka Masala.  I try not to order the Tikka Masala because I want to try new dishes but it is ridiculously good at Blue Taj.  Your entrees are always served with rice but Naan is a little extra.  Worth it though, need the Naan to soak up all that delicious sauce.  My friends poked fun at me for asking about the amount of sauce with the Punjabi - I ordered the Lamb Kadahi previously and it was very light on the sauce, which I should have expected from the menu description.  My boss is vegetarian and loves the Aloo Gobhi.  Also they have Tiger Lager (among some other beers - all bottled).  My only issue with the restaurant is the service.  The staff can be a little rigid and not very friendly.  Its just that they don't really speak very much to you.  Also last night we were slow to be waited on after we initially sat down and towards the end of our meal  couldn't get our water refilled.  From reading other reviews I would say the staff seems to be the biggest problem so maybe they can whip that into shape.  And if you don't really care about a little weirdness from the staff (I don't really) then I've really got nothing but love for Blue Taj.",

He was a little surprised and we said that we trusted his judgment and he could surprise us.

When I arrived I was greeted by a friendly smile and an employee willing to give his suggestions which I always love to hear what the employees like best. So I went with the chicken tikka masala, vegetable somosa, and garlic naan. It was by far the best I've had! The chicken was tender but not mushy and with just the right amount of spice. The rice was even amazing!  Now I know I shouldn't grade them on their service since I did take-out but they were the nicest group of gentlemen. They offered their bar for me to wait. Every server who walked past asked if I wanted something to drink. The manager came over to acknowledge they are preparing my food. I can't wait to come back to Ballantyne and take my husband here. He's never had Indian food before but I'm confident anything he eats here he will love!",

The tables were nicely set with very interesting, \"modern\" silverware and plates. The first glass of water poured was pretty tepid, but that's okay. We ordered, and I have to say, I've never had naan better than here. The naan was the best, I wanted to take a basket home.   I had lamb in a garlic sauce, which was absolutely delicious. However, it didn't sit right with me, and I've never had that problem in any other Indian restaurant. I didn't get like super sick or anything, just a little stomachache. It's not a huge deal.  The price is okay. I couldn't spend what I did every day. Oh, and there is a pretty great wine selection.   I guess I would probably go back, if I was in the area and everything else was closed or packed. I don't know. I'm indifferent.",

Colorful lighting illuminates all over the place from the red accent lighting in the bathroom to the color changing ceiling on the patio.  The background music fits perfect, an Indian inspired electro mix.    Many people in the area may not be too familiar with a lot of the entree selections.  Our waiter was very helpful in making recommendations.  Most of the entrees are about $14-18.  The vegetarian is a little less and there are some specialty entrees that are about $25.  I do not quite remember what I ordered but our waiter asked if I liked a couple things and adjusted my meal.  All I know is I had some goat in a red sauce with peppers and onions.  This was the first time I had goat.  It was similar to the lamb but a little more tender, probably because of the bones.  If you are very familiar with Indian food you can order anything you want.  The garlic naan is outstanding!  It is a must get.    There are a couple Indian beers on the menu and specialty cocktails.  I tried one of each.  The Haywards 5000 beer was good, a little more full bodied than a traditional world lager.  The recommended cocktail (I believe he called it a Dizzy Mumbai or something) had whiskey, absinthe, ginger, cumin seeds, and maybe a couple other ingredients.  It definitely paired well with my entree.    I do not see myself dining here often but I am looking very much forward to my next visit.",

Had to move because it was too chilly especially whenever someone opened the front or side doors. It was no problem to move.   Great veggie dishes! Delicious rice, flavorful okra dish, and some cheesy dish in red sauce. The garlic naan was a nice touch with the entrees. Definitely order a couple dishes and share because they are very flavorful and may be too much to eat one dish only with the same flavor.

Ok, a lot of businesses in this center have been doomed by the recession and other factors.  But, Blue Taj is the only restaurant I have seen in this particular space that has been busy - even at 8:30 on a Tuesday evening.  The decor is very nice.  I guess I would label it \"Modern Indian.\"  We sat outside on the small patio with a view of the color-changing fountain.  The colors above us in the patio also changes.  I was almost beginning to imagine that I ingested something I should not have due to all of the changing colors near me :)  The service was mostly good.  We had one main server but at least 4 different people waited on us.  The food was very tasty.  The vegetable samosas appetizer was almost bigger than my entree - actually it was.  That's where there place loses a star.  The chicken tikka masala was a pretty weak portion with no more than 10 small chunks of chicken.  The sauce, however, was flavorful, and the basmati rice was good too.  The naan was also fresh and delicous.  We used a discount from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> too, which took the sting off the wallet.  I definitely would not pay $15 for the small portion entree I received - no matter how good it tasted.  The presentation was nice, but that will only go so far.  They have a ton of vegetable options, so if you're vegetarian, you will probably like it.  I'll go back again, but maybe for lunch when it's a little cheaper.",

    "text": "Went last night with a group of 6. We had reservations and got seated right away. Service was very attentive and friendly. Our server was a young guy who was quick on his feet, nicely explained the different menu options and helped everyone decide what spice level would work best for them. I had the non-vegetarian appetizer sampler first. It was a combination of some Tandoori items (chicken, lamb and salmon I believe). It was good but probably a bit much for an appetizer, would be perfect for two people. I then had the much reviewed Tikka Masala and it was very good. I've had Tikka Masala before at some places on the west coast that I liked a little better, mainly because they included chunks of tomato and onion. Overall a very nice place, great interior design, great service and very good food. It was very busy on a Saturday night, so you want to make sure you got reservations.",

I usually get the chicken in a cashew cream sauce which is to die for, or the paneer (cheese) tikka masala. My husband will try the lamb dishes or more exotic fare...I stick to the same things because they are just so good! Love the appetizers as well and the naan is fresh and flavorful. Definitely worth it if you're in ballantyne! Or even if you're not :-)",

The plates used are conducive to being handled by hands. The presentation is good. The portion looks small, but are larger sections.   Cons:  My biggest complaint to this place is the arrangement. The entrance to the place [where the hostess is] is closed off, and there is a sign for people to enter from the side door [covered by an unheated tent] This is very awkward, and can cause conflict for people leaving and entering. Another issue is due to this setup there is no buffer between people eating and the air coming in from the door. I saw a couple refuse to eat there because of this. The flavor of the chicken tika masala, wasn't very out standing. It was a sauce, but it wasn't very complex. I asked for a 4/5 spice level, so I expected there to be a kick to the dish. There was none.",

Luckily, Blue Taj was open on Christmas day, offering a full menu of Indian goodness.  We started our meal off with a mixed grill appetizer which included lamb, shrimp, beef, pork, and chicken two ways.  It was very tasty, though a little scant for the price.  However, dinner itself was superb.  Our waiter asked us our preference on level of heat--mild, medium, hot, or India hot.  We weren't up to India hot, but my saag paneer was nicely medium spiced and creamy.  My husband went a level hotter with the lamb kadai, which had lots of fresh vegetables and as the name would suggest, succulent lamb.  The garlic naan was buttery and toothsome, and we got a big bowl of rice for the table.  Gulab jamun for dessert--there were only two, but they were really good.  There was a bit of a wait for the food between each course, but it was Christmas day, and the tables were all filled, so that was likely the reason.  We plan to go back.",

    "text": "If not the Queen City's classiest, Blue Taj is without question one of the city's hippest Indian eateries to date. Its coolly lit, swanky-modern interior but echoes the style and panache associated with Ballantyne Village, in which the restaurant resides.  For some, prices may be BT's Achilles' heel. A dining experience smooth and polished as the restaurant offers justifies comparatively premium costs, but whether or not menu items admittedly simple in nature like their 'Masala-Chili Cauliflower Florets' or 'Mustard Tawa Lamb' need require a $5 or $9 decrease in one's wallet, respectively, is understandably debatable.  It must be affirmed, however, that food taste and quality are consistently outstanding. Though non-appetizers offered below $10 are virtually non-existent, both lunch and dinner menu selections are more than substantial [despite opposing reviews]. Looking past the $13-20+ price range, nothing disappoints... each and every dish utilizes a considerably more robust complex of ingredients compared to those presented by competing Indian restaurants. Moreover, portion sizes are satisfactory.  One aspect worth highlighting is BT's selection of drinks and cocktails. Prices are expectedly high, yet the sheer uniqueness of each drink due to its fusion of traditional Indian herbs and spices far outweighs any initial pangs. Execution has always been flawless, and said reason is why I've swiped too many a card on alcohol alone.  FYI -- (1) the restaurant's front door is situated \"within\" the shopping complex's ground floor... NOT INSIDE, just not on an exterior wall that's visibly seen from the street/parking lot; (2) if there's a wait, fancy cozying yourself up at the bar located to the left upon entering; (3) SUNDAY BUFFET for $30; (4) first-timers beware Ballantyne Village's ever full parking lot at any hour past 4 PM... if need be, a garage is available.  Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... - Overall recommendation = 4.25 - Food taste and quality = 5 - Portion size = 3.75 - Price = 2.75 - Atmosphere = 5 - General service = 4 - Waitstaff = 4.5 - Location = 5",

I am back in Charlotte and my first buffet this time was in Blue Taj today but I was very disappointed with the food, servers and the billing process.  We arrived at 11:35 am (open time was 11:30 am) but door was still locked up. When knocked, one person opened and left as though we had forced him to welcome us. :) Food was not ready that time and they were still ordering their dishes.  About the food: mediocre food, nothing close to Indian for starters, main course (veg/non-veg). Goat curry was smelling bad, chicken had no taste and not very hard as though taken out from freezer and put in gravy. Desert (Rabri) was ok for consolation.  Servers: I had asked for some roti for my kids and they said they will bring if kid ask for it. Believe they know more than parent as what all each kids eat and when.  Billing process: I went to bill at the main counter and he charged for my 2 year old along with 7 year. when asked he said they charge for 3 year and older so I told them that my little one was 2 years. The person said that so what kid was eating  a piece of nan and some food in a plate. He said we have to clean the plate and it should be charged for that. I asked him so you are charging for washing an extra plate. He then removed the charge and said fine but we normally charge.  I said next time would be too much to be here. Better head to Peacock instead :) It was a big show off. The hospitality is bad and food was not authentic Indian at all. Last time here.",

    "text": "Working under the assumption that a restaurant is only as good as its most recent reviews, I feel I need to update my previously glowing review of Blue Taj to reflect the experience I had at lunch there today.  Unlike most local Indian restaurants, Blue Taj serves off a menu, not a buffet, for a weekday lunch. They also have some of the best Chicken Tikka Masala in town, so I stopped in today.  I was seated by a gentleman who appeared to be the manager, and throughout my meal it was never clear who my waiter or waitress actually was. After seeing me wait for several minutes with no one coming to take my order, the manager came by and took my order.  My food was brought out in a perfectly reasonable period of time, but the issue today was water, plain and simple.   I'm an easy customer at Blue Taj. I know exactly what I want, and I pretty much just drink water with my meal. Keep my water glass filled, and heck - just glance over at it once in awhile to check, and I'm happy.  The two women who were waiting on all the tables around me, couldn't be bothered to look in my direction once. Every single time I needed more water, I had to wait several minutes, try to catch someone's eye, and flag them down. It was a different person every time.  What really sealed the deal for this one star review was when I flagged the server rushing past me without a glance after dropping off someone's check and asked her if I could have some more water.  \"Sure, I'll get that,\" she said. And as I sat in full view of the cash register and water pitchers, I saw her walk up to the register and start talking to a friend who came into the restaurant. I don't know if my request never actually entered her mind, if it slipped her mind the first second after that, or in the 10 seconds it took her to go up and socialize with her friend and forget all about her job, but I was annoyed.  After that failure, I had to wait for the manager, who was outside talking on his cell phone, to come back in, finally turn around after 5 minutes and glance at the tables, and flag HIM to bring me some water. It's not rocket science to keep a glass of water filled.  After today's experience, I plan to just keep going for the buffet at Hyderabadi Biryani House down the road for lunch when my Indian food craving hits. Sure, buffet chicken tikka masala isn't as good as a freshly prepared individual dish, but at least they can keep a water glass filled.",

    "text": "Located in the heart of Ballantyne is the Blue Taj Indian restaurant.  I've been here several times and each time has been a great experience from the service to the food. If you've never been to an Indian restaurant, it can feel somewhat daunting but here everything is explained in a clear to understand manner on the menu so you know exactly what to expect. You also have the choice of which spice level you're looking for from none to the real deal, I personally prefer the spiciest level and it's delicious.   I'm still learning the menu, so I can't make a good recommendation but the Chicken Methi Curry seems to be my go to choice thus far. The prices are slightly higher than you'd expect but the food is worth it. Definitely, a must go to spot in Ballantyne. The location can be a little hard to find since it located inside of the common shopping area but when you smell the alluring aroma of the curry then you've arrived. Also, the noise level is higher than I expected on the occasions I've gone, so wouldn't recommend this a quiet romantic venue for dinner. However, by far one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.",

Also, the service was sporadic...we were either being bombarded or the girl was ghost or the one girl that was very available didn't speak english so she would have to go find someone to interpret what I was asking so that didn't help in terms of service.   The most disappointing aspect of dining here on the weekend is that they don't serve that little appetizer that most indian restaurants serve for free before the meal.  I have NO idea what the technical name is but it is like a thin cracker served with mango and mint chutney for dipping.  I was told that they don't offer that on weekends.  BOOO.  My tip---go to Blue Taj during the week.  I have been a huge fan of theirs but I was pretty disappointed by my first weekend visit.",

We probably eat here once a week now and I take clients here when they let me pick the place. I'm eating some leftovers from there right now, which is why I'm inclined to write this review.   You will clearly realize that the Tikka Masala is the bomb. We get it with chicken. The naan is perfect and the rice is delicious. At lunch, you get a tomato coconut? bisque (that is my choice every time, even when it is hot outside), naan, and a small dessert for one great price. Go for the 4 spice level - you'll be able to taste it without it being masked by the creamy tikka masala sauce and it's really not that hot. You can use more rice to offset it if you think it's too hot, but I doubt you will. Also, the service is always friendly and helpful. Give it a shot and try my suggestion...you won't be disappointed.",

It's a little hard to find because it's tucked away in an alleyway of the shopping center and you can't see it from just walking on the sidewalk - literally a hidden gem. I love that you walk in and the entire eating area is hidden by a dark curtain. It sets you up for a pleasant surprise when you see the awesome decor behind it.   I had the chicken tikka masala for lunch with a friend. It looked a little small but after I was finished, I was absolutely stuffed. The naan bread was to die for and I was ecstatic when the waiter asked us if we wanted more after our bread basket was empty. Also, we weren't too sure what spice was added to the rice but we weren't huge fans of it. But because the spice flavor is drowned out by the tikka masala sauce, I didn't mind it too much.   Lastly, when your done you get a complementary mousse to cleanse your palate. Honestly, it tasted like my friend's room (funnily enough, she's Indian too) - mango and coconuts. If I didn't feel like I was licking the air of her dorm room, then I'm sure I would have loved it haha.",

I think he could tell that I was the \"virgin\" when it came to Indian food.  I looked up at him with a \"please help\" look.  My food was awesome.  I had a seafood curry dish that was awesome.  I could have jumped in the bowl and ate my way out.  So good.  Patio area was nice and soothing.  A tad too dark when dining at night.  The waiters and the staff were all pleasant and so welcoming.

    "text": "Sunday Buffet review only.  We decided to come here earlier today because there isn't that great of an Indian food selection near Carolina Place, we have heard Blue Taj is good (but pricey) and they offered a Sunday lunch buffet from 11:30a to 2:30p. The two of us walked in and were able to sit down right away, I would call in earlier for a wait time if you have a larger party. Lunch buffet is a little over $13 per person, our bill was $33 with tip. The ambiance is a little dark, they have a red curtain that is pulled out near the door to block the natural sun light.   I really enjoyed Blue Taj's buffet because of the quality of food followed by the selection.  Our favorite dish was the Chicken Tikka Masala, just as our fellow Yelpers have found. I must admit the Chicken Tikka had a great earthy flavor just as it should have but lacked heat. Very tasty dish and safe for those who don't like hot food. Actually, none of the buffet offerings were hot, just flavored with traditional Indian spices like cumin and coriander. I also enjoyed the chili lamb, it was especially succulent. The Shahi Paneer and fried Bhindi were also delicious. This was also the first buffet I have seen that included Gobi Manchurian, it wasn't as crispy as it would be right out of the fryer, made to order but, it was still somewhat crunchy, kudos. Dessert included a cream/fruit dish and Gulab Jaman, I didn't try the Gulab Jaman I wasn't looking for anything heavy after that meal. The fruit and cream salad was actually really refreshing and crisp with apples, bananas, grapes, melons, strawberries, and watermelon. It was the perfect end to a heavy meal.   I was not a fan of the Pav Bhaji, it looked right but didn't have flavor. I also didn't like the pakoras (possible attempt at Vadas), they were way too doughy. I did not attempt to take on the Pani Puri station, I was pretty much stuffed and looking for tea at that point.   The staff was very attentive, they quickly picked up empty plates and refilled water as expected. Definitely a very good experience. I won't come back for dinner service but count on me for weekday lunch and Sunday buffet. YUM.",

The ambiance was quite nice, dimly lit and cozy, good for romantic dates or a small group.  I had the Tandoori Lamb Kahari which was very tasty and nice chunks of meat.  I wish it had more of a sauce to spread across the rice or naan, but a good tip is to share with someone who has a curry or saucy entree to get the best of both worlds.  The garlic naan was great, warm and flavorful.  I could eat this all day.  This was my first visit and was happy with the little I tried. The menu is plentiful and I would like to try more of it. It's a little pricey but great for some good ethnic diversity in this area.",

The Kerala seafood was just fantastic with it's slight sweet sauce. Then the Rogan Josh had tender lamb chunks in a rich and spicy sauce. Overall we loved our dinner, enjoyed the decor, the atmosphere, and menu choices. There is something for everyone, and the staff can make great suggestions for those who are new to Indian cuisine.

The restaurant is trendy and the wait staff was very pleasant.  Definatly will return.",

Chicken tikka masala- divine, cauliflower and potato- amaze, samosas- yum and garlic naan? Yes please!!!  We will for sure be coming back for more. This is a must try!",

Second, I blew out the candle at my table because it was giving me a headache. Someone rushes over grabs and with a forced polite notion \"you don't want this?\" And let's out a heavy sigh in disappointment as if I dropped a $15 dish.   Third, I asked for a bag  for my to-go boxes. He doesn't look at me as he keys in the order and say these words with pure irate: \"please go back to your seat. We're very busy! You should have asked for it when you asked for boxes.\"   They also added a mandatory gratuity for 5 people. Pretty sure gratuity is charged with parties of 6-8 or more.   This was all tonight, but for the record NEVER cater from these guys. They forgot the deserts and half the guests didn't get any. The food was cold. The naan wasn't fast enough for people. Their food is good in house. Don't cater from here.",

I'm not a huge fan of Indian food generally, but perhaps because they toned down the spice for us (you can specify the spice levels) I found myself enjoying the food a lot. I really liked the palak paneer and the chicken tikka masala, which actually had fairly tender pieces of chicken in it. I was a bit disappointed that the much raved about cauliflower dish ended up being not quite as interesting or tasty as I was hoping. But all in all, probably one of the better options for a late dinner in the Ballantyne area.",

    "text": "I have been waiting to go to The Blue Taj for over a month..the first time we couldnt make it because of the snow fall in Charlotte. Last night we went..I wish it would have snowed! The atmosphere is eclectic Indian, thats is interesting, the menu online looks good, so we ventured off to try it. When we sat down we were served an \"Amus Bouche\" It is just a one bite little appertif. It was the tinest speck of pear with a golden raisin and a sprinkle of curry powder on top...Okay...not anything spectacular. We started with Appetizers, My husband had the Wok Stir Fried Filet with Peppers and  I had the Tomato Coconut Bisque. The soup was the best item of the whole night! I wish I would have had three bowls of it. My husbands stir fried filet was good and spicey but for 13.00 it was less than  1 ounce of meat. We went on to order our entrees. I chose the Lemon Chive Corvina with Leek and Wild Mushroom Stew. My husband had the Scallops Sczhuean Peppercorn Sofrito with Chinatown Green beans. My fish was a flat filet, no lemon chive sauce on it, I called the waiter over and asked him what kind of fish was this..it did not look nor taste like Corvina..he said..\"Oh no we cant get Corvina so that is Halibut!\" Nice of them to tell me before I ordered...It was dry and tasteless, I asked for a chutney or sauce, the waiter said sure, He brought me a bottle of Sriracha Hot Sauce. As far as the mushroom stew..there may have been Mushroom broth underneath the fish, but I saw nor tasted no mushrooms. My husbands Scallops were okay, 4 med, no flavored scallops...The meal for four of us ( the other couple had almost identical items as us) with Two glasses of wine apiece came to 204. Not worth have of that....I was so very disappointed, and hungry when I left...Just not the fusion cuisine that they advertise...No flavor...anywhere...Save your money..dont go there!",

    "text": "We tried to Blue Taj a couple of weeks ago since we are planning a trip to India and were inexperienced with Indian food. First, like others had mentioned, the decor is bright and mod and I think it added to the enjoyment of our meal.  But what I really enjoyed was the FOOD!    We had a great waiter, his name is Vikrant (I don't know if I spelled that correctly) and we asked him what we thought we should order. He asked us how spicy we like our food, did we like chicken, fish, beef etc. And then he planned our meal.  I highly recommend this method when going to a place (or traveling) where you are outside your comfort zone.  Waiters know what food is good and they often do a great job with recommendations. We had the chili prawns to start (I don't think they are on the menu) and I couldn't get enough...just spicy enough. Then we had Chicken Tikka Masala--make sure you get some garlic naan to dip into the creamy sauce. And we had a lamb dish which the name escapes me but it was also great.  It was cooked in a tandoori style and very flavorful.  I have been craving the Tikka Masala and Naan (and the chili prawns) ever since and am looking forward to going back.  Vikrant was very friendly and helpful and I would ask for him again.",

I was never quite sure who my actual server was because our table got waited on by three different people, when somebody could be bothered to wait on us.  The staff seem to be more interested in speaking with each other and with customers. The food was decent but still high in price compared to other Indian restaurants in the area, however I don't mind paying a little bit more for fresh food rather than a buffet.  That said, our food was room temperature by the time we finally got and we could never catch servers I just send it back within five minutes after I arrived at our table.  Just a bad experience.",

I went around to check how busy it was, and less than 20% of the tables were occupied. Do not know what the problem was.

This is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to, and that includes restaurants actually in India (helpful note: do not eat at any restaurants in India if you ever happen to go there-- jk, why don't you try expanding your cultural horizons, douchebags!). We ordered the lamb kabob dish and it was probably the best meat I have ever had (non-sexually speaking).* The only problem I had with the food was that there wasn't enough of it -- all of the dishes were really, really small, especially for the price.   The service was pretty friendly, as I learned when I was waiting by myself for 15 minutes while my brother and his girlfriend took their sweet ass time getting there after they were looking at a house they might buy (aww they are so cute). Not that I'm going to read too much into this but I think it says a lot about where I'm at in life when my brother is looking for a house with a person he's in a stable relationship with while I'm sitting by myself drinking a beer and pretending to text my friends and then saying fuck it I'm ordering some samosas for myself. Anyway the waiter was really nice and I think he sort of felt bad for me and probably thought I was lying about people meeting me there because he really chatted me up. He told me I should hella move to North Carolina (I swear if one more person tries to get me to move here SO HELP ME-- it's not happening, you guys! I haven't alienated everyone I know in the Bay Area and failed at life out there yet, but when I do, then OK I will consider it.) because he thinks North Carolina is tits or something and also people don't say hella here. My friend James tells me the word hella sounds retarded and that dude speaks with a genuine Southern accent, k? Let's think about that, Bay Area friends.   And just in case someone at Yelp HQ gets a wild hair to make this an ROTD, let me just add that my newest sexual fantasy is to lick the chicken tikka masala sauce from here off of somebody's dick.** OMG my mouth just hella watered.***  *If you can already tell that I need to get laid soon, just keep reading because it gets worse.  **I told you.  ***Also, please do not PM me about this.",

Reviews are 100% accurate. Not cozy or intimate. You sit at tiny tables way to close to other diners in a very open setting. Awkward. Modern decor but just plain awkward seating arrangement with sounds bouncing around everywhere and ridiculously noisey chairs making loud farting sounds every time you move them. Ridiculous for sure.  The place is hard to find, directly across from mellow mushroom hidden in a sidewalk \"breezeway\".  Understaffed seems the norm. You will get your water refilled but definitely not your drinks.   The garlic naan is yummy and the white rice is delicious. I would still prefer whole grain options on both. Dinner was good, small expensive portions but just enough to take a little home. If you want an extra drink or extra bread definitely order it with your meal.   One attractive waiter serves too many tables with the assistance of a bus/water girl and a food expediter both of whom speak little English and can do very little for you. I would go back if I had another free gift certificate but would try even harder for off hours and I would keep my service expectations low and order extra garlic naan and a drink refill early. Get reservations too.",

They just loved it and I have to concur - blue taj has solid Indian food, and I've eaten at most of the Indian places in Charlotte. For appetizers we had samosas, mango chaat, and chole chaat. The mango chaat was excellent - everyone kept reaching for that dish. Samosa was tasty and the chole chaat was beautifully presented (and also tasty!). We had chicken tikka masala (can't go wrong w this one, spice level of \"2\"), shahi paneer, and lamb rogan ghosh. The lamb blew us all away - it was so tender and flavorful. My only quibble is portion sizes are on the small size for price. Service was excellent and attentive, and I can tell you this is typically a weak point for Indian restaurants, but blue taj clearly trains staff well. Atmosphere is quite nice as well. If you're looking for an Indian restaurant to take guests, you won't go wrong here.",
