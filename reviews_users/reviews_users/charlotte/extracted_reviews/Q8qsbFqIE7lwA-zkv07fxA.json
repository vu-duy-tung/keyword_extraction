The employees make you feel at home and they look like they love their job.  Very positive vibe!!  The owner John and manager Dave definitely have come a long way and it shows how much pride and care they put into their business and how much they value their customers. It's always nice to get food delivered by these guys but we love the new place so much, its worth to get out and dine in!!  Wishing them the best!",

Last nights dinner was a large pizza with 1/2 sausage (can you slice the sausage any thinner?), 1 children's spaghetti and 4 sodas. $35 BEFORE tip! WTH? The food was good but geesh not $35 good.  Your pizza is good but it's not consistent. Last nights pizza was good. I would suggest asking for the pizza to be prepared well done on the bottom.  Your hoagies (not Subs) are good. But for the love of GOD please train your staff NOT to put Mayo on an Italian hoagie. If you were in NEPA you would be stoned in the town square for putting Mayo on an Italian hoagie.  Your entrees are OK. The side salads are very weak.   The garlic knots are good and your service is fine.   We would frequent more often if you weren't so pricey.",

Meatballs (we ordered as an app for my son) are also good, and would be fantastic on a freshly baked submarine sandwich bun.  Great teasers for the 'Za.  Fresh dough, fresh toppings, and the sauce is a hint on the sweet side, which isn't my cup of tea, but it's still delish.  I would love to see them figure out how to crisp up my pepperoni, but they're not stingy with the toppings so I'm not complaining.  My one complaint however is an important one - it's expensive!  This place is easily as expensive as Hawthornes, if not more so.  Side of meatballs, large pizza with 'roni and fungus = $26?  Yikes!  That was just for take out too, forget about adding on two $5 beers... If they knocked down the price tag by about 15%?  not only would their yelp rating improve, but they'd have loyal brand advocates all over south Charlotte.",

I grew up going to Mario's and I always knew them as the place I go for great pizza and garlic knots. But they have stepped up their game! It was a tasting menu to match with the beer but also to show off what the chef cans do. First course was bacon wrapped shrimp which adding bacon is always a good thing and it was quite tasty! Second was a delicious salad featuring duck on top. Next we had some tasty bruschetta with smoked tomatoes and a balsamic reduction that really rounded out the favors! For the main course, we had a Cajun rubber pork tenderloin with a sauce made from the beer that the dish was being paired with along with a sort of au grated potatoes and asparagus. And for desert, we had creme brulee with a Belgian chocolate sauce and raspberries. I've never had a creme brulee with chocolate on it before but they nailed it. Overall great experience to really highlight for me that Mario's is a lot more than just great pizza and garlic knots!",

    "text": "We were very disappointed with the new location.  We frequented the old location many times for kids spirit nights, birthdays, etc. and always enjoyed it and felt welcomed.  But tonight, we felt like it was no longer a place for kids.  The kids menu is no longer printed.  The place has smaller rooms, more closed off.  The t-shirts and deserts that used to be right at the door of the old place were nowhere to be seen.  Parm cheese, red pepper, pizza stands were all gone from the tables.  Less TV's (only noticed one).  Cloth napkins instead of paper, but they kept the plastic 'glasses' ...confusing!  The best description we could come up with for the new location was \"sterilized\".  The old place felt like walking into a family run pizza joint.  We have no plans to return to the new location for a family dinner.  Service was very poor tonight.  We must have had a new server.  She was not aware there even was a kids menu (another server helped after I complained about them taking it away).  We had to ask for garlic knots, tea was warm with little ice, ask for refills and plates. The other servers in our room took better care of us as they passed by.  I'm used to Dave stopping by to check on us.  Whoever was managing tonight was only seen standing in the hallway or not visible at all, and never smiling.    The window shades did not provide ANY shade from the setting sun.  If you are offered a table in direct sunlight, refuse it.  It really put a damper on the ability for adults to converse.  More thought should have gone into this for a new location.  Food was still good!  It is the only good thing I can say for the place right now.",

    "text": "We have been going to Mario's pizza for the last several years and it has always had consistently good food and some of the best pizza in Charlotte.  My wife is from NYC so it was a requirement that we find something relatively close to her home-town pizza, and Mario's fit the bill.  Over the past year or so, it seems that Mario's has slowly been changing the pizza to the point that now, I may rank it below one of the many chains.  I can't put a finger on any one specific thing, but it has gone way down hill.  The crust seems to now be thicker and less crispy, the cheese is lower quality (though they seem to be putting more on, which means worse taste and more grease), and the sauce is not quite as good as it used to be.  I hope this changes but until then, i will be looking for a new pizza joint.",

    "text": "I have lived in the neighborhood across the street from Mario's for 8 years now, but just now getting around to writing a review.  If you asked me 5 years ago about this place, I would have rated it 2 or 3 stars.  However, I'm pretty sure they tweaked the recipe to their pizza, and it's now my favorite pizza in Charlotte.    Overall, I think the prices are fair, but I do think $1.75 per topping is a little steep.  If you eat there, the complementary garlic knots make up for it a little.  I would say 80% of the time, the garlic knots are cooked to perfection (warm and doughy), but the other 20% of the time, they have been luke warm and a little stale.  They will swap them out for fresh knots if you ask nicely, however.    Not sure if anyone has seen that Family Guy episode where they poke fun of \"Every Pizza Place\" and how they ruin a salad, but Mario's is slightly guilty of this.  The salad being put in a lasagna tray on top of a hot pizza box is not uncommon.  I don't eat at Mario's for the salads, so no big deal for me.    My main recommendation would be to change around the draft beer selection every once in awhile.  They've had the same draft beer for as long as I can remember.  The only thing they seem to rotate is the Sam Adams seasonal.  They keep the beer on the \"John's Place\" side, which is a bar owned by the same guy who own's Mario's.  The cool thing is there is a small hallway connecting the two establishments, so you can always decide to go sit in a more adult friendly area (no kids allowed in John's Place).  One final kudos ... fantastic fried pickles and above average chicken wings.",

It wasn't as bad as Dominos or Jets but we will not be back.  You know that feeling you get when you first see the pizza and you realize it is not going to taste good? That is exactly what happened. They must realize this happens so they don't have the pre-maid slices behind glass so you cant just walk out before ordering. I ordered some pepperoni slices and they just added the pepperoni to a cheese slice and heated it up. Not cool, it's not the same and you can taste the difference.

My take out orders were always delicious and hot still by the time I got home. Made it really easy to pick up a good dinner for my family after work.  I took my dad here this past Sunday, and inside the restaurant, I was not really that impressed. Our waiter was okay, but not that attentive. We came pretty late in the day, so it wasn't busy. My one complaint is the TV situation for the booth seating. You CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. No point in having football on if only tables across the restaurant can see it. They have these huge round table lights that obstruct both TVs on both ends of the restaurant. No matter which way you turned, you could see a corner at best - and our table was right by the TV. This appeared to be the case for all booth seating. I'd suggest moving the TVs, or take down the lights. It just made it really frustrating to have the game on, but not being able to see it when you're sitting right there under it.",

I called in an order for pick up and was \"greeted\" on the phone by a very uninterested male who didn't even bother to fake interest in customer service. Honestly, I should have hung up and gone elsewhere. I went to pick it and it was ready on time (hence the 2 rather than 1 star) Their food is not cheap, and my relative paid (even tipped!!) and I could not have been more embarrassed when we got home and opened the bag.  A lot of the food had leaked out of their containers because they were not sealed well (despite being held upright the whole way home) The lasagna piece was minuscule, the salads were measly, the spaghetti and meat sauce was good, but greasy. The bread was pretty hard. Very sad dinner.  The great thing about Charlotte is that we have a lot of good food option and there is no need to frequent inconsistent restaurants. Sadly, Mario's is now off my list.",

The entire experience was a pleasure, the staff is very attentive, the food comes out in a well timed manner, and everyone in our party really enjoyed everything from the appetizers all the way to desert. We will be going back for sure!!! Highly recommend the place! I have dinned at much higher priced restaurant and this one really hits it out of the park and it's not too bad price wise either.",

These days we love Johns new location on weddington rd. We can order delivery or grab an evening to ourselves at Johns place to watch football games. The food and service is always warm, friendly and consistent. I know a lot of previous reviewers harp on the new location, but I commend John and his family for making such an investment in the matthews/ stallings community. We are grateful for their efforts, food, and sense of community. Keep up the good work. We will always be back.",

Pizza is very very salty. I eat it knowing that  I'll have to get up in the middle of the night and gulp down a couple glasses of water. Prices are high for slightly above average quality.

Despite clarifying that I simply wanted grilled chicken breast and NOT buffalo chicken, they still sent me buffalo chicken ... with ranch dressing all over it. Barf! To top it off, this pizza wasn't cheap ... $53.17 to be exact, including a $3.00 delivery fee. I think the delivery fee is new and it made me not want to tip the delivery guy. I gave him $5 bucks. So, $58 total for two pies that no one wants to eat. Its time for Mario's to close.",

I'm visiting from San Francisco, where just the concept of parking is a luxury, but the service and food here is so good I had to review it before I flew home.  We had a room pretty much to ourselves at first (we were a pretty early group), but the server took really good care of us. When a member of our party wasn't delighted with her drink, the server let her share my bottomless-Bellini order (it helps that neither of us is much of a drinker!). The kids loved the garlic knots, and they got more of both knots and sauce promptly, without asking twice.   Our party ordered a mix of lunch and brunch dishes, but the brunch dishes were AMAZING. I had the Bourbon Street mac & cheese, and two days later I'm still longing for it. We ordered donut holes for the table: they were so light and warm and tender. They were dusted with cinnamon sugar and something else, something bright and almost fruity. You could taste the butter in the sauce. That's what brunch should taste like. That's love.  The next time I visit my sister in Matthews, I bet we won't be able to get a reservation here. Go while you can still get in, and take the kids. Everyone will thank you for it!",

    "text": "$25 lunch with no service.  The food here is great, I've been three times. But twice now, I've sat outside at lunch and been basically ignored.   At lunch, you pay for your food at the counter when you order it, and the receipt has a tip line on it. I don't carry cash, so I either have to tip before I sit down or stiff them. Don't like that.   I ordered a medium pizza for lunch, which was larger than I needed. I'm pretty big, and I only ate half of it. I should have ordered by the slice, but they didn't have the one I wanted that way. The pizza and a drink came to $22 and some change. With a reasonable tip, that's over $25 for one person to eat lunch. I thought that was kind of steep for a medium pizza.  They have a great patio, so I sat outside. The food came pretty quickly given that they had to make it. After they dropped off the pizza, I finished eating and had plenty of time to write this review and read several pages on Quora before she came back out (not to check on me) to clean off another table. That guy had come and been long gone in the time since I saw the waitress. I had long since finished my drink, never got a refill. I asked for a box, and that took another ten minutes. By this point, I was wishing I could give the tip to the cook and not the waitress.  Since this is the second time I've had this kind of experience, I probably won't be going back. Which is a shame, because the pizza tasted great. I've had their eggplant parm sandwich and it's really good.  All three times I've been there it was almost empty. I like the food, and the patio is nice. It's a shame the service is so bad.",

I've been to Mario's a handful of times and each time the waitress just never came by again after bringing the food.  We were there for an hour and got 0 refills until we asked for one after we were already pretty much done with the food.  There were only 3-4 tables occupied the times I was there and the drinks on those tables didn't look like they were filled either.  The pizza here is not very good, but the other entrees are pretty decent.  I've been here for the steak night several times and the steak has always been cooked to spec and the sides are pretty tasty as well.  I will come here if I don't feel like driving but there are plenty of better options for the same price.",

Good experience overall and the quality of the food was great! Happy to have found this place.  Over the weekend, I ordered a medium veggie  pie which was also very good. I do have to say that I find them to be expensive. My spaghetti Alfredo dish was $15 and the medium pie was $22.  This might become a \"special occasion\" place to order from.",

Chicken Parm was frozen with canned sauce, lasagna was floating in grease, again with canned sauce.  Garlic Bread and cheese was ok, but the sauce was once again canned.  The food surrounding us for the other diners had no aroma, plating was messy.  No seasoning, bland.  Wait staff was fast and attentive, shameful that their tips will suffer due to the food quality and taste.

She was very personable and we were never waiting for long.   FOOD All the food was delicious. We ordered the Stromboli, which takes a little time to prepare so we ordered a variety of appetizers. We tried the garlic cheese bread, which was a perfect combination of garlic and cheese. We also had the complimentary garlic knots with fresh tomato sauce.  I had a Caesar salad which was good (the croutons were made from the garlic knots!) we had Philly cheesesteak egg rolls that were so tasty and gambino shrimp scampi which was my favorite and I highly recommend.

First off were greeted by a friendly face and seated right away our server Amanda was great very attentive and helpful with any questions. Back to the food it was delicious and the portions were a good size. The complimentary garlic knots were awesome too. We will be going back to try other items for sure.",

    "text": "Still being new to Matthews we have been looking for nice places close to our new home.  Mario's fits the bill in more ways then one.  Just set back a bit from the road, this restaurant has a ton to offer.  Nicely landscaped they have a few gardens for fresh herbs and vegetables they use for menu items.  In the front it has a really nice and tranquil pond and rock feature. It is also worth mentioning they have a nice outdoor section for larger parties.  On the inside the charm continues.  We have visited  twice now, and each time we have been greeted by friendly staff.  It feels a little smaller on the inside, the dining rooms are broken up a bit.  The benefit to breaking up the rooms is that even though you may be closer to others enjoying their meals, conversations don't travel.  We have tried a few different items on the menu.  The spinach artichoke dip was extremely satisfying.  The ingredients are fresh, and I could be wrong but the spinach might be from their garden.  We also tried their garlic bread which was also very tasty.  Both times I went I ordered the Seafood Fra Diablo.  On some of their menu items they give you the choice of a half or full portion.  Honestly I couldn't tell the difference in the two.  Both good portions, only thing I really noticed was more pasta on the full order.  Either way it was outstanding.  My wife enjoyed both her meals, the most recent was the lasagna. It was really good but tasted like it was missing something.  Not sure if it was the sauce, it was still really good but needed something we couldn't put our fingers on.  They also have a really good drinks menu.  My wife has fallen in love with this strawberry shortcake drink.  She won't stop talking about it.  The beer menu is solid, I'd like to see a few more local IPA's but it was satisfactory.  So if your in the area and looking for a place to try, or even a bit far away this place is worth the trip.",

The first excuse was that he was traveling. His workers can't refund mistakes?      This is NOT the first time I've been overcharged here in take out. I don't like to write bad reviews for restaurants I frequent weekly but I've had enough of the lack of integrity. Twice I was told I'd be refunded. And wasn't. I wish I had listened to other reviewers several months back. I ordered a kids pizza (got charged a larger size and charged double for toppings I didn't order), $2.50 a topping?? Ordered  a large salad and got the one in the photo with dirty lettuce. Then I ordered the larger sized ziti and they halved the size. You tell me if you think that photo is worth $34 in food. Ridiculous.  Not only that, their rolls tasted like dish soap. Can't get money back for that though. Really is a shame. I won't order take out again here.",

This is your place for New York style pizza. Lovely selection of wine. And the desserts?! Fogetaboudit! Coconut cake, yum! Limoncello gelato, heaven!! If you're visiting, this is a great place for a home cooked meal. If you live in the area, this will become your new regular joint. John and Martha will make you feel like family.

We also brought in our own cupcakes and were charged $1 a head as a cake cutting fee. Go to Bricktops by south park for better food and value and at the very least some atmosphere!

Casual place to take kids, especially when you want to watch a game.  They have HDTV'S.    We ordered a couple slices of cheese pizza (very good flavor) and a couple of subs (a turkey & an Italian-#3) per their recommendation.  Hard to beat these when you can order it your way.  The only complaint...the provolone was left off of one.     Dine indoors/outdoors, pick up, order on line, have it delivered, or catered.  Adults looking for something a little more upscale???  Visit John's Place next door.  They serve Mario's anytime the bar is open!",

In our experience, the young girls who take your order have a hard time hearing you over the phone (it's quite loud in the restaurant); but once you get past that, you're good to go.  I despise chains and cheap-o pizza (Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's etc) and love Mario's. It tastes very \"New York\" to me, but is not quite as crispy as a good NYC slice. I recommend Mario's White Pizza, it is delicious. Also recommended in the entree category: the Baked Ziti Sorentina.   However - beware of their salads... their Greek salad is a joke for $8.99. It should be more like $5.99 for the size and ingredients.  I definitely think that Mario's a bit overpriced no matter what you get... c'mon $35.00 for two (simple) pizzas? (one medium, one large). It's a bit much.   I don't believe we have ever had any issues with delivery. In our experience it always arrives quickly and is usually still piping hot.  We happily pay the $1 or $2 delivery fee - even though we live within walking distance of the \"other Mario's\" in Matthews, in Matthews Festival.   I guess the fact is, in the Charlotte area, we are deprived of really great pizza, especially those places that deliver, so Mario's fits the bill quite nicely. It's not perfect, but it will do for now.  ~",

    "text": "Marios consistently serves excellent food with fast and friendly service.  To start, the garlic knots with marinara are totally addictive as another reviewer has pointed out!    If you are in the mood for something light, go with a salad and a slice.  My fav salad is the Mescalun (with candied walnuts, dried cranberry, and goat cheese with Italian dressing).  For the slice, I usually get chicken with mushrooms and black olives - but you can choose whatever you like.  The crust is just right - not too thick, not too thin. The sauce is good and the pizza is never greasy.    But, if you are in the mood for something a little \"heavier\", they have excellent pasta and other traditional Italian entrees.  A couple of my favs here are the Eggplant parmesan, Chicken Marsala, and Seafood Fra Diavlo.  Also excellent is the Spinach Stuffed Shells!  The entrees come with a salad and garlic knots and are large enough to have leftovers to take home, which is a nice bonus!  This is one of my fav go-to places for a great meal at a great value.",

Mario's has gotten it together and aside from a few hiccups, food and service has been vastly improved. The service is quicker, and new menu additions are superb. ( I held back one star because recently we placed a pizza order and what was delivered was clearly a \"not fresh\" pizza...hell lets just say it - someone decided to box up an old pizza and deliver it...now when I order I specifically ask for a pizza made to order and it's been fine)",

If you want a pizza that tastes like it was made with real ingredients and fresh, you can't go wrong here.  When the kids are away and wife and I want pizza, we get takeout margarita pizza and it's probably the best in town.",

I love pizza and would probably pay anything for a great one but sorry Mario, it's average at best. Their 2 slice lunch special is fair but that's it. Hopefully some day they will realize how much business they are losing with rediculous prices for so so quality and service.",

They charged $8-10 for a small plate of noodles and plain red sauce for kids and extra for kids drinks! Unbelievable! You can cook spaghetti noodles for a whole family for $2! For 4 kids this added up to whole lot of wasted money and the biggest tab we've ever had at an average quality restaurant such as this. We felt totally ripped off and will not be returning.",

    "text": "We were excited about trying their advertised double pork chop. We got sat down in a nice booth eager to try the food and we waited... and waited.. It took about 20 min before someone came around to take our drink order. and we waited.... and waited... Finally got our drinks and the waitress took our order for appetizers and meal. The wings and Arancini. Both good. Then came our main meal. I had the Seafood Arrabbiata (1/2 order) and my hubs had the double pork-chop, specifically ordered as well done.  The pasta dish was ok. Nothing special, overcooked shrimp and barely there clams. The scallops were cooked well, but the calamari was rubbery. The double porkchop was beautiful on the outside, but when hubs cut into it was raw. Waitress took back and came back a few minutes later with still under-cooked pork (this time it was pink, with a bit of raw) The second trip back to the kitchen with it and finally a manager asked, where is your chop? Told her we sent it back again and she flitted away. 3rd time was a charm and the chop was finally cooked to order. Although by this time I had nearly finished my pasta & keep in mind we got no refills on beverages offered to us either. The waitress was very apologetic, but surely the manager who came by the table and took our check would have apologized as well and even offer to take something off the bill??? Nope! The meal for both of us including one cocktail was nearly 75$ too. High prices, bad service. Sorry Mario's I really wanted to like this meal, but no joy.",

But on Friday I found myself too lazy to drive and pick up the pizza so delivery from Mario's it was!  I had pizza the day before so I ordered pizza for my nephews, a stromboli for my dad, who definitely does not need to be eating that and the chicken marsala for me.  It comes with a salad and over spaghetti and a side of garlic knots, its really too much food.  Delivery was much quicker then they estimated.  As I remembered the pizza didn't look good, its just too saucy and not a good sauce either.  But a 3 and 6 y/o could care less and they devoured it.  My dad complained that they didn't make a stromboli properly and he would never get that from there again.  I knew what to expect with mine, its not an extraordinary chicken marsala, but it hits the spot when you have a craving plus it was enough to provide me with leftovers for lunch the next day.  Overall, I would probably not rush back to order Mario's again.  I prefer Tony's pizza and when I want other Italian dishes I have a few other favorites around Charlotte.",
