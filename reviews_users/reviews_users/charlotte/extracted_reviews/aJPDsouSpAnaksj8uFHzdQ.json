The menu gave a lot of choices and I decided to try something that should have been familiar, teriyaki chicken with fried rice. My dinner was anything but familiar. The chicken had very little flavor, and the flavor the rice had, was bad. The best thing in the box was the candied carrot. The ginger sauce was very good. The service was relatively fast but I was disappointed in both the quality and taste of the food.",

    "text": "After a failed attempt to get food at the other new place in Belmont, Jax, we ended up at Sake Express. They are definitely a very welcome addition to Belmont eateries.  This was our first visit to any Sake Express. It starts out as a normal fast food joint placing your order at the front counter, but then you pick your seat and a server comes and brings you your drinks and then your food. This place was a perfect fusion of fast food (got our food fast) and sit down service (more attentive service then 90% of sit-down restaurants). As far as the food, we ordered the vegetable entree and 1 eggroll and the teriyaki chicken. With 1 drink and a water the total came out to $13.21 plus a few dollars tip.   The vegetable entree was superb. A mix of zucchini, mushroom, onions, carrots, squash and broccoli were cooked in a soy sauce which added just enough flavor without taking away the full flavor of the vegetables. \"Deeeeee-licious\" -wife The teriyaki flavor of the chicken wasn't outstanding, but the carrots that came with it were. The generous 4 ounce cup of shrimp sauce mixed with the chicken and rice made it a solid meal. The menu seemed like a good selection, however no sushi in case you were wondering.",

Typically you pick your grilled meat of choice (chicken/steak/fish) which then will be accompanied by rice and sweet carrots.  Although you can switch up the rice/carrots with other veggies/noodles.  This place simply makes great food at a very comparable price of other fast food chains.  I have also noticed that their chicken is very tender and juicy versus other fast food Japanese restaurants I have ate at who tend to over cook and dry the chicken out. Go check it out!",

But WOW how their service has changed compared to Gastonia. It's awful. The one manager there is arrogant and has no idea about customer service. We called in an order and asked for no mushrooms. Go home and it had mushrooms.  Called them and that manager said you have to request no mushrooms. We did. Went back to the store after arguing with him that we can't eat it they were going to make it again. Got there and he asks for the receipt. Gave it to him and he says \"see it doesn't say no mushrooms \". Now if you have ever ordered from there you know that they out the order printout on your order along with the receipt. I told him that and that the server didn't give me that printout. That's where the no mushrooms would be. He shut up. Never going back.",

Also she never came back and checked on us for drink refills or to see if we needed to go boxes.  In fact no one did.  However she did seem to enjoy eating her own meal at a table while doing something on her phone.  When we pulled up there were 4 staff sitting on the sidewalk on the side of the building and four more sitting at a table outside.  Must be this business pays its staff to sit around and do nothing.  Staff spent more time socializing with each other than they did the customers. I will not return to this location but will drive out of my way to go to Gastonia to eat in or the Mount Holly drive thru.  Bad customer service makes good food not worth having.

I'm sure that's a flat out lie!!! They close at 10:00PM and all food should be available and served till closing time. I walked out ticked off and you just lost 30.00 in sales in a food order. I will never step foot in this place ever and I will let other know of the unacceptable service and to be lie I was told by the irreplaceable employee. The lie upset me more than the food from this wannabe sushi restaurant. They have sushi but they where in early clean-up and didn't want to make it!",

I walked up to the cash register and waited for someone to take me order.  NO ONE CAME!!! The workers just kept walking by and not even acknowledging that I was even there.  No... \"I'll be with you in once sec\", \"Hey how are you doing\", \"Hey we have a customer up front.\" This went on for 7mins....7, I counted.  All of this is just compounded from my previous visit when my order was sooooo messed up because of bad customer service. I'm just surprised at how customer service has dropped off so much here!  They really need to fire a couple of staff members and try to revision their great service again.  Until then I will not be wasting my hard earn money on bad service!",

    "text": "Fast food meets wok cooking, Sake Express has worked out how to combine a bunch of ingredients and make it into a double dozen number of entrees. Pick your protein (chicken, steak, shrimp, scallops, etc), pick your veggies (mushrooms, snap peas, etc) and pick your starch (noodles, white rice, brown rice or none) and a few minutes later, it's brought to your table. If you're looking to filly your belly for only a handful of dollars, this is the place. The noodles and rice take up most of the space - so if you're eating low carb you might be disappointed with the quantity.  Here's my complaint. They have a wait staff who brings your order to the table and they are also responsible for refilling your drinks. There is a big sign over the soda fountain (Pepsi products) area that it's \"employees only\". Which is a problem because our waiter spent ten minutes talking to two customers at one of the outside tables instead of checking in on us. Bruce gets thirsty, donchaknow?",

Or let's just be real about this, if your live in gaston county u learned that a cup of shrimp sauce, rice and sweet carrots is perfectly acceptable meal lol. Shrimp sauce, has absolutely nothing to do with shrimp but it's like crack cocain, once u take that first hit. Baby I hooked! I've been eating at the Gastonia location since I was 6-7yrs old n discovered shrimp sauce lol, 20 years later they are still the top restaurant in gaston county. Me living in Belmont my whole life n having Belmont location open, I was excited. I even decided to work at the Belmont location for a veryyyy short period of time. I'm better at eating then working lol. Since the addition of the sushi menu I have to say, I love the options! Get some sashimi or tuna tataki to munch on first then go ham on your hibachi.

I mean, I could understand if I had pulled up at 8:50 and they said that, but there was almost a whole hour before they closed. Disappointed, but still hungry, I ordered the teriyaki shrimp and a sweet tea. The boy taking my order said they were out of sweet tea and not making any more tonight. Again, why not just keep everything stocked until the very end of the night. Guess if I want sushi and sweet tea I'll have to show up hours before closing next time",

I love going to the Japanese restaurant the only thing I don't like is having to wait for all of your meal to make it to your plate. With this place you don't even have to get out of your car! (What ) Sake has a drive thru!!! You do have to wait 5-7 minutes after you order and pay to get your food. Someone brings it out to your car. Not a big deal in my opinion for the amazing food that's in that white box. Whenever we go there my six-year-old always yells mom don't forget the Yum Yum sauce!",

I was a little annoyed but didn't say anything because I knew they had been busy. However, when I arrived at home I realized that they had given me a Bento box with no sushi. I called before coming back to ask that it could be ready since I had already spent so much time waiting. When I got there, it was sitting on the counter with a note that said pick up for sushi. I had no apology(come on!) and no offer for a discount or refund... I had hoped that they would at least give me a full order of sushi to apologize, but I got a half order.   Long story short, some improvements need to be made for mobile orders on busy evenings, this was a mess and it will be a while before I come back.",

I recommend the teriyaki chicken and egg rolls which are more like spring rolls.  The chicken is not dry like some of the other express Japanese places I've been to in the past. Oh and their shrimp sauce is amazing too.  They have you order at the counter and sit, then a waitress comes around and ask for your receipt which I've usually already thrown in my purse. That part seems kind of backwards to me. Why they don't get number cards like mccalisters, idk.   Bottom line, food is great, price are super reasonable, customer service could be better.",

I'm all for giving chances because I do believe in \"off days,\" but it seems to be an ongoing trend at this location. I got chicken with soba noodle and the Sake Dragon Roll and was very disappointed in food quality. Nothing tasted good. Sushi had a strange texture and smelled and tasted fishy. Good quality sushi, though made with fish, doesn't smell or taste as such. The noodles were tough and chicken had no flavor. Very disappointed. I paid over $22 and only took maybe 5 bites of food before throwing away. I got my food in the drive thru so I was not present for them to fix anything, not do I think they could have without a full refund.",

The hibachi steak or chicken are my go to since the teriyaki is just additional sugar I don't need. There's other options like veggie only or shrimp, scallops, noodle bowls, kids meals, edamame, spring rolls, seaweed salad, and sushi.   The interior design is modern and casual with fun colors and cool wood design. There's a fountain that kids love but it could use a good cleaning. Service is fast and friendly which is a good sign since it's tons of teenagers there must be a good manager involved.",

Drive thru - convenient, never heard of that concept before and how is the food done that quickly? I had teriyaki beef upgrade to filet, needed more teriyaki, a lot more sauce. Good shrimp sauce, fried rice was okay/average. Going back in future for convenience of it.",

    "text": "Sake Express is an interesting concept as it is a fast food modeled sushi restaurant.  I was skeptical at first as I have never witnessed sushi made in a fast paced environment such as this but I was pleasantly surprised for the most part.  Sake Express has a wide variety of items on their menu, many of which are not sushi. This can come in handy when your companion or children don't particularly care for sushi.  The quality of the sushi served can be improved, however, Sake Express is aesthetically pleasing on its interior, and the staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  If you're in the area, stop by and give Sake Express a try!",

I've been here 3 times now and I always get the veggie hibachi entree.  It comes with an awesome mix of broccoli, squash, mushroom, onion, zucchini on top of fried rice and topped off with sweet carrots.  The portions are huge and there's always plenty for leftovers.  The food and service here have been consistently good.  This location is brand new so it's nice and clean.  When I'm starving and don't want to cook this is a reliable quick and delicious meal.",

I mean, it's not that hard to put teriyaki sauce on the meat when I ask for it, also the rice and meat just tasted, bad, like it was burnt and old. Carrots are always good, but I can't just survive on carrots. Maybe they've been having an off month? But all I wish is that my food be brought to me how I ask (and since I usually get to go I can't just get them to \"fix it\") and that it be as good as it used to be!",

I then asked him to ask someone and find out, and i could here him in the back ground \"hey, so there is no way to make a salmon noodle right, no way!\" \"yes mam, i can offter you a side of salmon and noodle with no veggies\"....i dont understand, i work in a resturant and this is something we could have done!
