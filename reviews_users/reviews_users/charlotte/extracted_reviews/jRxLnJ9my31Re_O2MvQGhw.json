It was amazing!!!  I had two meals from the small bowl...lot of food.  The lady at the counter offered me various sauces to try before ordering. Great service and efficient.   For those of you who need to cater  office lunches...this a great option for something different in the workplace.  I will be back and bringing some friends !",

If the staff in this \"mom & pop\" continue to execute at this level, this wonderful, unpretentious little joint will become a destination spot. The location is a little tough... Seek it out!

But today a really sweet girl came into my work and gave me a menu and it was filled with my favorite go-to lunch - chicken pitas! The prices were also slightly under what I'm used to for this area so I decided to head over and give it a try.  I had a really pleasant experience. The food was fresh, hot, and fast. In addition, the owner took the time to ask me where I worked and he even gave me a sample of his Thai sweet chili rice bowl and it was AMAZING! The sauces are homemade and everything is so fresh tasting! It was topped with pico de gallo and a layer of shrimp sauce - both of which were obviously homemade. The owner was kind and generous and when you combine that with fresh, delicious, reasonably-priced food - this place is destined for success!   Don't be afraid to try a rice bowl - I honestly wouldn't have ordered it but after trying the sample, I have no doubt I will be back quite regularly to chase down that fresh, saucy deliciousness!  **UPDATE*** 18 days and more than five rice bowls later, I can officially say this is one of the only places in Steele Creek that I CRAVE! Im so happy to see this place always busy...hopefully that means they will be around for a long time! It's definitely something delicious, unique, and really good quality in the area and was much-needed!!",

This place has a deli vibe but they serve not just sandwiches but also rice bowls with different sauces to choose from. The owner is super nice and will let you try a sample (rice and pico with the sauce you want to try in a decent sized cup). I've gotten the jerk and the teriyaki, and I have to say I do love the teriyaki. The jerk is also good but I thought it didn't work as well with the pico. Would recommend the chicken over the shrimp since they use the teeny shrimp that isn't the best.  Their fries are also AWESOME and just how I like em. They actually forgot to make ours so they threw in some onion rings which was very nice. Prices are reasonable and seating/parking is plentiful! Great quick lunch spot.",

You get how passionate he is about what he is doing.  I told him I had never been there before and so began the train of samples. It was unreal. \"Try this, try this, try this\". I was stuffed when I left and my order was to go.   The rice bowls are different. They like to play with flavors. It's like going to you buddies house that everyone says should open a restaurant. We'll this guy did.  My wife is celiac, so he ran through the ingredients he uses and made her something we both felt was safe for her to eat. She loved it. It was a buffalo chicken bowl.   I ordered the gyro, which was very good. I ate even though I was stuffed. To be honest, I bursting at the seams. My fault for over eating.

But my bowls were both good I bought 2. Asian Thai and jerk chicken. Excellent! And the staff are so charming and friendly. Go here!!!!!",

    "text": "I came here from a recommendation from a co worker. Let's start from the beginning. I walked in and am immediately greeted. I walk to the counter and inform them I've never been here before. They asked me my comfort level with spicy food. Told them and before I could say anything else, I had a sauce sample and a rice sample. And these samples aren't small. Think syrafoam ice cream bowl size full. Yep! He said we can make anything on the menu or we can whip something up. I let him do his thing and whip me up something. Excellent decision, he made me a mango habanero bowl. WOW WOW WOW!!!! So good. There are three different sizes I opted for the regular which was plenty enough for me. Roger is extremely friendly and wants to make sure everything is perfect to your liking. He is open to suggestions and criticism, which is awesome because it makes you feel as if your opinion matters. The price was perfect. Honestly $11 for my meal and a drink is great. Especially since I couldn't finish it and will finish it for dinner. So two meals for me for $11. I'm okay with that! Let's get into the flavor. Everything is so fresh and flavorful, it will linger on your tongue after. So so so delicious. I will return and I absolutely recommend everyone come out and try this. They close at 4.",

The first two times I ordered the Mexican chicken rice bowls and they were delicious. The regular size is huge.  Could easily cover two meals.   Today I tried the Jamaican Jerk Shrimp rice bowl which is a 9/10 on the heat scale. It was so delicious! The heat scale is no joke, it really did make me sweat. Sometimes spicy food can be so spicy it's unenjoyable but this was just perfect. Tasty to eat and left a nice kick of heat. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and you definitely get a ton of food with whatever you order. Can't wait to try the other flavors!! The owner is super nice and friendly as well.",

He said, the Curried Jerk is about a 8 spice level and Mango Habanero is about a 5.   I had to wait for a few short minutes for my to-go order and the quantity of a regular bowl was more than sufficient for one.",

Many places list an item as spicy and it barely has any spice, but here spicy really does mean spicy which I can appreciate. Everything on the bowl tasted fresh and was cooked to perfection. The rice, which a lot of places slightly over cook, was absolutely perfect. The prices are SUPER reasonable for the portions that you get. I'm a big guy so I got a large thinking that's what I'd need to get full and I definitely couldn't finish it all. I ordered takeout via yelp so i didn't eat inside but it looked clean. The owner was super friendly and had me in and out in a jiffy. I'll be going back",

The chicken in the bowl was not seasoned at all and was a real let down! The other ingredients were okay but the chicken being boiled with no seasoning was a complete let down for my husband and I, so much we threw our food away!!!

I decided today for lunch im going to finally try this place i have a good feeling im going to love it. Low and behold i called to place a order so it would be ready when i arrived and Raja who's the manager answered and he could tell i was unsure of what i really wanted i heard so much about the jerk chicken bowl when i mentioned it to him he asked did i like spicy food? I told him yes to a certain extent so he took it upon hiself to say hey tell you what when you come in ill give you a few samples so you can decide which rice bowl you want to order,surely when i arrived he said i been waiting on you, he did as he said he would and fixed me up a sample to make sure it wasn't to spicy for me if thats what i really wanted,well it was a winner and i was sold! Noticebly i realized Raja knew alot of the customers by name which let's me know he engages alot with his customers, now that i think about it he even asked me what my name was when he gave me the sample, also i noticed him walking around asking everyone how was their food etc, he will go very far, with all of that being said i ordered my Jerk Chicken Bowl and was on my merry way!",

I work in Uptown Charlotte, so this was about 20 minutes away, and after reading all of the rave reviews I did not mind the drive at all.   I decided on a regular sized Curried Jerk Chicken Rice Bowl, and I am so glad I did! The host said that it was a 6 out of 10 on the spice scale, and to be honest it was the absolute perfect amount of spice. Still gives that heat kick while remaining very flavorful.  Although this is a bit of a distance away from my work, I foresee myself returning here for lunch again and again to try all of the different sauce options they have. So happy I found this place!",

I looked at the menu and figured I would give it a try since they offered both Jamaican and Curry jerk rice options. The prices vary by the size, but my regular rice bowl totaled a little over $9.   Again, most places say their food is spicy and they somehow disappoint but this did not! Not only did I receive my food quickly (5-7 minutes), during the lunchtime rush, but it was GOOD! It was fresh, healthy and hearty all in one! But they have Philly's that look and smell delicious if you're not opposed to mid-day 'itis.   I will be back!",

    "text": "The Tasty Bowl Subs and Such is truly a  hidden gem of Westinghouse Blvd. I ran across this restaurant playing around on Yelp and I'm glad I stopped in with a friend and my mom for lunch.   Being our first time we were full of questions. The owner Raja was very helpful. He asked what flavor spiciness we liked and created a few samples for us to try. I let my mom try one of the samples and she said it was too sweet so Raja created a new sample for her and it was a winner.   The concept for the rice bowls is very simple. You get rice, choice of sauce and meat (chicken or shrimp) and pico de Gallo. The menu is a little misleading cause there is a miss print but you only get one meat choice with the price on the menu or you can have both for an extra charge.   The bowls were amazing. What's really impressive is the size. We all ordered the small bowl and couldn't finish. We ordered a Sesame Ginger Teriyaki, Mexican and Thai Sweet Chili bowl and 2 orders of fries. The fries are very crispy and seasoned well. I'm not a fan of pico but I was very trusting of Raja and the mix of rice, chicken and pico was outstanding.   Raja came by our table to make sure we were all satisfied with what we ordered. He made some spicy sauce for my friend to add to her bowl. He's very personable and we learned he even remembers his regular customers choice of spiciness.    I will definitely be back. There are so many flavor options and I want to try the subs and their wings!!!",

BLAST OF FLAVOR! I was planning for a pita but the rice was too good. Maybe next time! In the end we got the Jamaican Jerk and Mango Habanero rice. I LOVED the Jamaican Jerk, and the spice lvl 8? was no joke. It built up haha. My bf preferred the Thai sweet chili but everything was delicious nonetheless. No lack of spice at all but I will definitely get more pico de gallo and we are super excited to come back next time to try the other flavors.   Hidden gem. People who work in the area have probably known about it for awhile but for newcomers, this is a place you won't regret :)  We will be back for the owner's friendly/inviting gestures, rice bowls, and maybe their homemade fudge too!",

I have no idea what's  in it other than steak and shrimp  but it's always  flavorful. It turned out to be a Teriyaki Jerk rice bowl that wasn't big on heat & spice but rather on flavor. It made a nice change to my spices from hell voyage that I had been on since I knew about the place. Tasty Bowl is branching out from the rice bowls and now offers soups, chili & pasta dishes. Every day there's a different special. If I could I'd eat there every day but for now I have to limit myself to one or two days at most.",

You can choose from the many options with the rice. You can choose white rice or brown rice. Then you can add proteins including chicken, shrimp, and I believe steak.   I also noticed that they have traditional subs, salads, and Nathan hotdogs on their menu.   We beat the lunch crowd, arriving around 11:45a. The restaurant is in a busy park area.

As other reviews have pointed out the service is awesome- they're clearly passionate about the food they make and want the thing you order to cater to your preferences, and they offer samples to make sure you're getting what you want.   The rice varieties are varied and span a lot of different flavors/cuisine types. They offer three different sizes for bowls, and honestly the small is plenty but for hungrier times/if you want leftovers the other two options are nice.   Also super reasonably priced for what you get! We spent less than $20 between the two of us for lunch and that included some drinks.   Stop in!

    "text": "It's about time I give these guys a much deserved review. They've got some things down pat about the food business. Service is where it's at these days. I visited for the first time months ago and made it back again just recently. They were certainly worth a second visit (and a coupon in the mail didn't hurt either).  At first it's a bit overwhelming - lots of flavors make the menu seem like too much to consume in a short moment. But if you're new and there's not a line forming behind you, they'll give you a sample taste of any of the many flavors mixed into a few bites of rice. On my latest trip I couldn't decide between the Indian curry and the Thai. So they just said \"Hey we can mix the two together.\" Sweet! And spicy! It made for a good mix. I got brown rice - trying to stay healthy y'all - but white rice is an option. There are three sizes and I gotta say, the smallest is enough. They package them in plastic take-out style bowls and give you a lid just in case. They know you will probably end up taking some home.  Now of course there must be some downsides to counter act all the good press. The prices are a bit high, though it's about the going rate for comparable types of food these days. The location is a bit out there and inconvenient but, I know they're doing good business at lunch with all the companies close by. And the chicken in the bowls left a little something to be desired. It was cooked dry and without seasoning. Nothing that the excellent sauce variety can't make up for. Last but not least, the staff here is incredible. Family run for the most part but even the non-family staff have always been friendly great to talk to. They make you feel welcome and have tapped into the next wave of brick and mortar business: good service!",

I wasn't too sure what sub to order so he asked me how much I like spicy...well I LOVE spicy stuff so he said go for the Bull Rider and I will make it extra spicy for you. That sandwich was on point. Nice and spicy (they can make it not spicy if you want too) and a really good amount of food for the price. He was even hanging out with some regulars at another table while I was eating. Very cool.  The other time I came I went for one of the rice bowls. Curried jerk and grilled shrimp. It was awesome. I got the regular and it was a ton of food (especially for the very reasonable price). Both times I stopped in I had one of the mango juice drinks...super tasty and from some company in Jamaica. Not something you can get everywhere!  Its easy to pass by the place..in a random office complex in a mostly industrial area. The inside is simple with a good amount of seating. Hopefully I get another work trip to the area because it was awesome!",

Everything was awesome from the moment we walked in. The owner came out from the kitchen and asked if we had been there before. When we said we hadn't he asked us our preferences on spice level and flavors and then brought us each a different sample to try. The samples were delicious and he continued to provide recommendations based on the other questions we asked.   I got a large chicken rice bowl with a Thai/Curry sauce combo. He ended up giving me an extra large bowl instead and it was so much food! I got multiple meals out of it. The food was amazing and flavorful. I also got a side of fries which was not necessary, but also delicious.   You order your food at the counter and they bring it to your table for you. Everyone's food came out pretty fast.   I cannot recommend this place highly enough! I will definitely be back in the future. It's worth coming out of your way to try.",

The food was pretty phenomenal. I was able to try their wings with Carolina Reaper sauce and those were extremely spicy but still quite a bit flavorful. The mistake I made was trying those before I actually had my chicken rice bowl with Thai chili sauce. It tasted really good but I couldn't catch the spice in it, most likely because my tongue was numb from the reaper sauce. Definitely a note to self to not have that sauce before trying anything else the next time I come. But the bowl was really tasty overall and I love all the sauces and vegetable they add to it. They also give you a large amount of food as well. I was so full off barely eating half of my bowl and two wings that I was able to save plenty for dinner later that night. And because my taste buds had recovered I was actually able to get more flavor and spice from the Thai chili sauce! Try it if you get a chance to come here. It's pretty tasty.",

    "text": "First of all, #YelpCLTTop100, check out the list if you haven't, because these guys made it all the way to #2 on the list! So how in the world haven't I heard about them or been here yet? Probably because since I'm a North Charlotte guy, Steele Creek might as well be Narnia as far as I'm concerned. Even if you're well versed in the area (my office is only 4 miles away) you're liable to miss it or pass right by. It's in a bit of a weird spot in a commercial office park and on a lower elevation than the rest of Westinghouse, so you really have to know exactly where you're going.  All that being said, when I saw this place so high up the list, I had to give it a try. Since work isn't too far away, I ventured up here on Friday afternoon and walked into a very simple but clean restaurant. It was off-peak lunchtime but there were still about 6-7 tables enjoying their meals as well as a handful of people picking up to-go orders. There was one REALLY loud guy behind the counter running the show: Expediting, cooking, taking orders, talking to regulars, etc etc. If he wasn't the owner, he was clearly the mastermind of the day. When it was my turn at the counter the first question he asked was if I had been there, and when I said no, he had a quick questionnaire to see what I was in the mood for. After a quick-fire Q&A, he gave me a small sample of some rice with seasoning and it was honestly the most dynamic combination of flavors I've had in a LONG time. I told him whatever was in that, I wanted a regular portion of it!  I find out at the register that I was getting the Thai Sweet Chili Chicken rice bowl, which was perfectly fine with me. The wild guy behind the line (who I later found out is Raja) was a delight. He has one of those personalities where he can relate with pretty much anyone and has you literally eating out of the palm of his hand!! After a 5-10 minute wait I was out the door a mere eight dollars poorer with what I already knew was going to be an delicious meal thanks to the sample.  When I got back to the office, I could really appreciate all the work and creativity that goes into The Tasty Bowl's food. First of all, a \"Regular\" sized rice bowl is still huge! You get a generous helping of perfectly cooked rice, huge chunks of chicken, and topped with the sauce and veggies of whatever style you choose. Everything just worked so well together. There were both creamy and spicy components of sauces (it looked like two different sauces), crispy and fresh aspect thanks to the shaved veggies on top, moist cubes of chicken, and all in a piping hot package that was just incredible. The spice-level was exactly what I was hoping for. The questions that Raja asked are spot on for pinpointing exactly what you want.  I mean, how can you not give a place five stars when after meeting someone just once, you'd eat literally anything he put in front of you without question? With this food this good so close to work, I'll be back again, and again, and again! In fact, if it wasn't for the fact that they're closed on the weekend, I would have come back the next day!  Food so good you'll get goosebumps. Great prices with an amazing team that show their passion quite clearly in their trade. I'm sold!",

    "text": "Some of the friendliest counter folk, perhaps ever. At least some of it could be due to the location - despite knowing where you are going, you need to be on the lookout, as they are not only in a business park, but the park itself is a bit downhill from the road, and there is not a ton of signage, so be prepared.  Once there, you also need to figure out how to get in. They are located on the corner, but the \"main\" door is over on the one side, and there is a back door (somewhat like the back door at McDonald's, that is by the bathroom), and you can go in that way, but you'll end up in the back. The front door is a bit better.  Regardless, once you are there, they ask if you've been. Since it was my first visit, I don't know if they do this for everyone, or if it was just me, at which point they asked if I wanted to try some rice (or perhaps if I liked rice, but the idea is about the same). Since I'm all about the rice, I went with it, and then proceeded through a few other questions to try and find a good menu option. Several tastes later (and rapidly getting filled up already), their suggestion was a jerk chicken.  It actually was tasty, but I'm not a huge fan of jerk, so I decided to go a different direction, with something more Asian/Thai inspired. Again, the flavors were good, but a couple of things did just not hit the taste buds quite right.  The rice was a bit wet. This isn't a horrible thing, but it meant that it wasn't like a fried rice. The other thing is that the Thai Chili (closest I can come to describing the sauce) was more of a sweet sauce, with little heat to it. They did add some homemade hot sauce, but it wasn't a Thai sauce, more like a Tabasco or Texas Pete.  Since I was rather full already, I saved half of the regular (?) - the medium sized bowl and ate it later, at which point the flavors had mingled nicely. Ultimately it was a nice experience, but for those particular flavors, I think I would go elsewhere, and perhaps choose a different direction.",

The place is casual, efficient and clean.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.

I was greeted immediately, was given 2 samples to try and the woman who was helping me explained all about how the restaurant worked, how I could adjust the spice level and various other options. I ended up having the beef curry rice bowl and it was delicious. The small size was good for lunch. After I started to eat the chef came out to talk with me and he was happy I was enjoying my meal. He proceeded to talk to me about how he wasn't quite satisfied with the beef he was using and that he is experimenting with different cuts to make sure his customers only get the most tender and flavorful steak. He invited me back to have the same dish in a couple weeks after he finishes experimenting. While I ate he periodically came out from the kitchen to talk with diners and make sure they were happy. He had friendly conversations about travel and food which was nice to see.  One of the best indicators of the restaurant's hospitality is that the staff knows many customers' names and the customers know the staff's. Clearly these are people who return to eat here often. I will be joining them!",

He is loud, gregarious, coarse, and funny as hell. He hands out samples in sizes that make eating lunch harder. I had 4 samples and could have gone home happy but I stayed for a shrimp bowl with reaper buffalo sauce, grilled veggies, pico and who else even knows but him and it was fantastic.

After having an opportunity to try some samples, I settled on the least-spicy teriyaki sauce on top of a chicken salad. I know that sounds like a weird combination, but just put your trust in the staff's suggestions and you won't be disappointed.   As for the service, the head chef identified early on that I had never been to the place and so he took the time to explain the menu, offer me some samples, and make suggestions based on my personal preferences. Considering that this was during lunch hour on a weekday, I think that's pretty awesome of him.   I do have to warn that he sometimes uses language that isn't what I'd consider \"family friendly\", and at times it could be downright offensive depending on who he's speaking to, but something tells me he doesn't really care what you think about how he talks. Overall I appreciated his straightforward style and even got a few laughs out of it.   Based on my experiences so far, this place is certainly worth a visit if you're in the area.",

    "text": "All of my orders have been deliveries via FOODSBY so far but one day I plan to make a visit. There are only a few menu items available using the service but everything I've tried from Tasty Bowl has been prepared well. Even though I haven't been to the physical location, I will attest that customer service is awesome, I recieved a phone call and text from Tasty Bowl regarding an order once just to clarify what I wanted. They didn't have to do it but they did and I appreciated it. Rice bowls and wings are good. Im not a big rice eater but the flavor of the meat and added sauces were really good. This time I tried the gyro and I was pleased. I always use Showmars as a guide and this one was up there with them if not better. I will definitely continue eating from Tasty Bowl when possible.",

    "text": "Not bad at all. A friend recommended that we go here on her lunch break. She's a big fan.   The staff was awesome. Even before I ordered my food one of the people ( I believe the owner ) walked up to me and my toddler and asked if I'd like him to put something on the TV for her. He was really friendly and went out of his way to bring her a drink.   The food was good and fast. I got the bourbon sauce with the chicken and rice bowl. Not the best bourbon sauce I've had but definitely not the worst.  Im a big fan of Asian style bourbon sauce. The pico de gallo they put on top was very good! Both friends are regulars at this spot so needless to say they also enjoyed their food.   I would recommend Tasty Bowl. Will definitely be going back, hopefully will my husband. They have a mango habanero flavor that I'm sure will be calling his name. Wish I knew about this place when I worked over that way. It's a great place to stop for lunch if you work in the Charlotte Premium Outlet/Steele Creek area.",

    "text": "I recently started a new job in Charlotte and noticed my coworkers all coming back from lunch break with these deliciously smelling boxes of food over and over again. I thought I'd be nice one day and pick up one for myself and my coworkers, I told the nice lady on the phone my order and her customer service was phenomenal, asking on a scale of the 1-10 how spicy do I want mine. Who does that? I told her 7, and it was fantastic. The real treat was meeting the owner, Raja. He took time to introduce himself and tell me if I need to more or less spicy to let him know that way he can pretty much custom make my bowl for me. What! Once again, who does that? NOBODY IN TOWN! He was super friendly, asking what flavors did I get and then making some suggestions. This man genuinely cares about the people that come his restaurant. I can't wait to go back tomorrow and tell him about my review for his awesome restaurant!",

    "text": "I noticed this restaurant about a month ago and thought to myself \"what an oddly placed restaurant\" as it is in the middle of Westinghouse between South Tryon and 160.  I went back to my office and googled to see what they had to offer. Then today, based on those reviews, I decided to try it out. OMG I am so glad I did!!! Holy Moly, that was delicious! I walked in and was immediately greeted. After staring at the menu blankly for a bit trying to figure out what to order, I was asked if I had been there before. The moment I said no, I was asked if I like spice. I described the level of spice I can handle and bam, I had a sample handed to me, a good size sample.... and it was delicious. I ended up talking to Raja for a while about catering and the different offerings they have. He had asked for my name for my order and actually used my name several times rather than just to shout out my order was ready (which would have been odd anyway as it was ready within the time we were still talking and I was standing right in front of him lol). I ordered the Sesame Ginger Teriyaki, size regular, and sadly ate it all when I returned to my office (I could have stopped at half but it was so good!). If you are in the Steele Creek area looking for a new lunch spot, I highly recommend this place!!!",
