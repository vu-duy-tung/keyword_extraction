    "text": "The first two times I wanted to have dinner at this restaurant I called and no one answered the phone ... no answering machine either. So I figured it was permanently closed. I called a third time and they were open! Not very far South East from where I Iive but it feels like it's in the middle of farmlands, well at night it does. Inside, surprise it a bona fide Japanese road house. Cool. It was a personal celebration and we went a little nuts ordering sashimi, nigiri and rolls : the dinner ran $150 for two but we took home enough to have a full lunch the next day. Plus the house offered us a number of complimentary samplings.   Most of it was very good to excellent -with a couple of hiccups, like for example the yellow tail was still nearly frozen but overall it made for an excellent sushi house on the outskirts of Charlotte of all places.   FYI no you can't get fresh fish in Charlotte nor in most other cities either. It HAS to be frozen first, but that doesn't make it bad. In Miami the charter sport fishing boats used top show up at local Japanese restaurants with fresh Wahoo, Mahi mahi and others, but they've over-fished the area to complete near complete extinction. Welcome to the 21sts and enjoy it while you still can.",

I wasn't sure about Osaka, but decided to give it a shot one lunch hour about four months ago - I'm really glad that I did!  I've definitely become a repeat customer.    The sushi is fresh and expertly rolled - it doesn't fall apart.  The crunch roll is VERY yummy.  I usually get the sushi and sashimi bento box, it runs about $11 and comes with salad and soup, and more than enough sushi and sashimi - I've never gone away hungry and more than once have been unable to finish it all!    The service is decent, it's never been bad.  I absolutely recommend this to my friends!",

After a year of nigiri in Japan, a girl just needs some kind of ludicrous fried and eel sauce laden roll, you know? :)  We ordered a spider roll, a tempura shrimp roll topped with eel and avocado, a fried roll wrapped in another roll, and a spicy tuna roll, and I tried to get a salmon skin roll but they were out. They were huge! The fried components were nice and crunchy, and there was a nice mound of undyed pickled ginger on our dish, which is always a plus.  The green tea they serve was the nice toasty tasting kind with the rice.  While we were waiting they brought out two free apps for us, a heart shaped rice patty topped with something (I didn't catch what he said, but it was good), and a flaming plate (!) with a scallop shell filled with cheesy crab and seafood. Amazing, and they didn't even know it was our anniversary, although my SO accused me of telling them when he got back from washing his hands and the dishes were on the table.",

The sushi was OK, nothing out of the ordinary definitely not something that will bring me back to this place, the hibachi lunch was horrible, my chicken and veggies were swimming on oil, so was my husbands steak and shrimp and the \"fried rice\" was not fried rice at all it looked like rice cooked on beef broth for some color, needles to say I am suffering from the worse heartburn case I had in a few weeks.  The service?..... we were rushed from the moment we walked in, so much so that we got our check before we got our lunch, right after our sushi roll, it took a while for the waitress to notice that we were still sitting and when she came to check she figured that we were still waiting for the food. She did apologize many times, but by then I was wishing I had canceled the order instead of receiving the hibachi. I would not go back :( sorry.  PS... I did like that wooden door, that was a nice touch.",

When we complained that cream cheese was not in the description of ingredients, they said the rolls are subject to chef discretion (actually the explanation was not that simple or precise, but that is what the server was trying to say).  We gave then a second chance. All was well for 2-3 other orders.  This last time was a to go order.  We tried the tempura seafood for the kids.  12 pieces of seafood was the menu description.  We had 16 pieces of fried broccoli, onions, carrots, zucchini, 2 pieces of shrimp, and 6 pieces of something else.  Also, it was not tempura.  It was breading like you would find in your local grocery frozen fish section.  I called back to complain. I was polite, really I was.  I asked them why I had all then fried vegetables when I ordered seafood.  I was told,\"I just work here, I will ask my boss\". She came back and said, the order was correct.  If I was not happy, I should come back and they will give me more seafood.  I ask for them to credit me back the \"seafood\" tempura.  She said they would not do that.  I asked her if the \"shrimp\"tempura came with fried broccoli as well?  She said\"no it does not\". I then asked, \" why does the seafood tempura come with it then\". In the end, I took everything back to a very nice young lady who seems to completely understand my position, but she \" just worked there\".  Horrid customer service.  And it starts from the top.   Stay away.",

    "text": "After deciding to buy a new home while still owning one, I write my first Yelp review, after the very long and tedious wait. After a few months of being frugal, for once in my life, I told my wife it was time for our much needed date night. Of coarse she picked my favorite... sushi! I have to admit when she said lets just go somewhere local I was a little weary at first. If you read some of my earlier reviews, not only do I love sushi, but I can also be a bit over critical on sushi restaurants. I typically do not like your local downscale sushi joints. They tend to be, lets just say.... quantity over quality. I am really pleased to say that after the dinner I just had, I was completely 100% wrong. After my first few bits I looked at my wife and said \"I am going to Yelp the crap out of this place when we get home\".  At first sight, Osaka is certainly not eye opening place, but it is certainly a diamond in the rough. In this case, great food and service in a small, older strip mall. We were definitely well greeted and well treated from the start. The restaurant wasn't super busy but it did have a good amount of people there. We sat at the sushi bar and all of the wait staff served us throughout the night. I miss that type of service from restaurants when all of the servers work as a team. The sushi chefs were extremely pleasant and were very talented as well.   As soon as I started seeing the sushi coming out, it made me start to rethink my position about the food. It appeared to be quality and quantity. As usual I ordered a bunch of different rolls and appetizers. They also sent us out a couple of appetizers on the house for us to try out as well. They gave us a tuna carpaccio and a crab salad app that were both to die for. The crab salad came out on fire as very aesthetically pleasing. We also got their volcano roll, tuna trio, the godfather roll and the kiss roll. All of them not only looked amazing but also tasted out of this world. I completely loved all of them. I am not a huge fan of cream cheese in my sushi so I was only able to eat a couple pieces of the godfather but it was really good. The one huge kicker about all of the amazing sushi is that pretty much all of their rolls are under $10. That quality of food, specially for seafood is almost unheard of.  Ultimately, I was happy my wife picked Osaka. I am also glad that I broke the local sushi bar stereotype as well. Certainly, I am excited that we found such a great sushi restaurant near our new house. Definitely give it a try if your east of the city one day.",

Most likely a cheap cut. After I got home, I found that they forgot to put my soup and salad in the bag, so I had to go back. They were nice, but the food overall was under seasoned, and the quality of the proteins were below average. Smallish shrimp and bland, small, strips of overcooked steak. The miso soup was so-so, and the salad was pretty bare bones (iceberg lettuce with three shavings of carrot). I won't be going back.",

We had sushi and hibachi and both were great. The prices are phenomenal, we will come again for dine in and take out. Clean and very friendly! Well done.",

    "text": "Despite what I've heard about the sushi at Osaka, my first visit was fare from the kitchen, and I was pleasantly impressed.  They offer the expected hibachi entrees, as well as a nice selection of tempura dishes. I opted for the tempura chicken and vegetables - very crisp and tasty! The ginger dressing used on the salads is not the spicy, tangy dressing you normally find, which provided a nice change. The chefs were experimenting that night and brought us a sample of an appetizer not on the menu near the end of our meal: a jalapeno concoction that was quite good.  Another plus for me is that they include tofu as a protein option, and they actually cook it well.  The staff are very quick and incredibly friendly. I'll be visiting again pretty soon.",

The sushi was definitely not fresh and the assembly and presentation were lacking appeal. Operators should be careful when selecting restaurant names and not have the ability to live up to them. I will keep looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant with authentic and more traditional cuisine.",

Unlike your typical Japanese cuisine, Osaka is your hole-in-a-wall type of restaurant, it isn't fancy and doesn't have much of an atmosphere, but who cares?! The sushi here is GREAT for the price you pay, PLUS Osaka probably has one of the fresher selections and quality sushi/sashimi in Charlotte. I don't care for much of the hibachi items at any Japanese restaurant so I never tried theirs but it just looks like your typical hibachi you order anywhere. I've had no problems with service, staff is friendly and attentive. One of the main reasons why I LOVE Osaka is because the staff will throw in appetizers and little dishes on the house for customers to try. The extra effort Osaka shows to their customers sets Osaka above many places I've been to (hell I can't even recall many times where I got added-value items on the house, even at nice \"5-star\" restaurants).  I'm super picky when it comes to eating sushi, so trust me when I say Osaka is among the best when it comes to sushi in Charlotte!!",

Osaka is a nice little restaurant tucked into probably the wrong strip of stores--it should relocate to an area with better stores or more traffic.  Either way, really nice young guy sat us and was our waiter, very polite and brought us a crab tempura-like appetizer for free to try.  We ordered about six rolls and some sashimi and steamed dumplings. They have really unique rolls I must admit!  I've not had sushi with all the different little sauces they top the rolls with.  Fresh and well made, not too big, not too small.  We sat outside which was nice and quite.  I think we will add this spot to our sushi rotation.",

Not so much for the decorating and interior of the place, which honestly, isn't all that hot but because the food is just delicious. The group I went with shared 4 of their specialty rolls and everything about them was perfect from presentation to taste. Another thing to note is that they serve little complimentary apps before your meal so you start out with some free seafood salad as well as rice with a spicy sauce on top. These apps are very small portions but it's just one of those \"value added\" treats that a lot of places do not bother making the effort to do for the customers. We did also order some Edamame as a additional appetizers but I was a little let down on the portion size here. There must have been a uptick in the soybean market or something to cause them to have to cut back on their Edamame portions because usually places will load you up on these. But I digress. Anyways, if you are a sushi person this one is a \"must hit\" so be sure and give it a try.",

The sushi was decent, the few pieces of hibachi steak were tiny and the smallest portion I've ever had, same goes for the scallops and the sweet carrots were way too sweet.

Then I ordered the dinner combination hibachi steak and chicken which comes with fried rice, salad, mixed vegetables, sweet carrots, miso soup, and shrimp sauce on a huge plate everything was cooked perfect and tasted great. My friends got sushi, I didn't so I won't comment on it other than to say they enjoyed it and it was pretty. My drink glass did go empty for quite some time and I did have to ask for a refill as did my friends. I would only give service 2.5 stars, across the board it was a delightful evening.",

    "text": "Everyone has their little neighborhood hot spots and THIS is mine.  I feel like a proud mother right now as I review this place because I live right down the street and we don't have much else to offer in this east charlotte/sorta matthews/mint hill area.  I'm proud to call Osaka my own.    Osaka is our claim to fame.    The atmosphere is not that great, the service is just okay and if you are ordering take-out it will be somewhat of a chaotic mess when you arrive.  They are clearly understaffed but I drove by yesterday and saw a \"We are hiring\" sign so that is a good thing!  Whenever I pick up my take-out the cashier sifts through a TON of receipts on the desk and somehow pulls out the right one.  It is actually quite impressive.  As far as the food...very fresh, consistent and great flavor.  They have excellent sushi.  I even love their vegetable roll for all the vegetarians out there....typically a veggie roll will have a cucumber and some carrot--bland and pukity.  But, Osaka takes it up a notch--they have asparagus, ginger relish, cucumber, carrot and you have the option to add cream cheese.  ***Insider's TIP: No matter what roll you get, they throw in a few free pieces when you order take-out!  They typically throw in something similar to a spider roll with eel sauce drizzled on top.   I've also had their vegetable teriyaki over rice and that was also excellent.  The veggies were fresh--broccoli, onions, zucchini, squash, mushrooms, peppers.  They are not overly saturated in soy sauce but rather tossed lightly in their teriyaki sauce.  It comes with a side salad and a side of their ginger sauce.  The ginger sauce is awesome.  The location is inconvenient for so many people and it isn't like you are going to make a night out of hanging out in Mint Hill...but if you are in this area, it is worth the visit.  Heck, if you DON'T live in this area, it is worth a visit.  It is actually worth the drive!!  See you there!",

The dressing was definitely house made. It was tangy and citrusy and very good. We even received a complimentary radish roll...that was a nice surprise.   We tried 4 different rolls and all of them were very good. The service was the best part. We pared ways with our previous go-to sushi bar because the service had take a decline, so this was a refreshing surprise.   We'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "Just finished my flavorless hibachi steak entree.  I have a favorite sushi spot in town but they don't have the hibachi plate type I love to each (non-bento).  I sought Osaka out since it was close by and the photos look ideally good.  The staff greeted me and helped me with the menu for a takeout order.  There are special prices for sushi if you dine in.  My order seemed to be fine as I left.  The sushi (kani) was okay.  I like the two pieces that came with it which was like a bagel/fried style better.  I was thrown off wondering if I was charged for it.  No description about those pieces included from the menu.  A little pricey because I usually order Eel Avacado for the same price of $4.50 anywhere and it taste like a $6 roll.  The wasabi was REALLY fresh (moist) and made me question if other sushi spots use was REAL wasabi.  I chose hibachi steak as my single entree because that's usually the protein to order.  It was a helpful serving with sweet carrots and mixed veggies.  The steak and veggies were totally not seasoned.  Just cooked with oil and looked like pepper but no pepper flavor.  No smell of flavoring and quite a bit of water in my plate.  My cat who always stares and begs for food didn't want the piece of steak I gave him.  In fact, he sat down then left the sofa.  I absolutely loved the ginger sauce and would love it in my salad if I was to return.  There's a good hint of pineapple and orange in it!",

The service was fast and friendly, but the food, which is the main reason for going to a restaurant, was really pretty poor.  I got a seaweed salad, which just didn't taste right, even though I've had them at Osaka before and thought they tasted great in the past. V2 Sushi orders, a California roll and a salmon roll, we're fine. But the two plates of chicken teriyaki tasted like something I would get at a public school cafeteria. The chicken was overcooked, the vegetables were overcooked, and not fresh cut, for example the carrots obviously came out of a large can of cut cooked carrots, and tasted like those hard things I remember from school days. Unfortunately that flavor infected the rest of the vegetables so the whole meal really tasted pretty bad.  I would give it a one-star, but like I said the service was excellent and our waitress very friendly and accommodating. And the sushi was okay.",

The miso soup is really good too! The sushi always rocks. We've taken down an ungodly number of Godfather rolls & crispy philly rolls. And for dessert, fried green tea ice cream. Always leave this place very full & very satisfied. Staff are super nice too. And at leas for this year, they're doing an all you can eat special, $20 (sometimes $15) a person, whole menu is all you can eat. The catch is if you order too much sushi & don't finish it, there's a penalty for each piece not eaten. So bring your appetite if you wanna try it out.",

The hibachi menu is pretty cheap for lunch and the portion sizes are HUGE! I normally make 2 meals out of the $6 dish. Great deal, right?! I always get the Teriyaki Chicken with Mixed Vegetables. It comes with either fried or steamed rice. In case you were wondering, Teriyaki sauce is a little bit sweeter than Hibachi sauce. It depends on your preference, but I like the teriyaki sauce more.  Last time I went, the host informed me that they have a sushi special on Wednesdays (Dine-In only). I can't remember if he said Buy One Get One Free or Buy One Get One 50% Off. Either way, I'm tempted to come back to try the sushi (since the Hibachi dishes are pretty good).",

The menu was large and extensive.  They have Japanese style hibachi food and sushi.  I ordered the miso and salad to start and then had a teriyaki tofu dish.    The tofu was large and a bit soggy.  The flavor was good, but it was definitely too soggy/wet for me.  The veggies were tasty, like I said the sauce they used was flavorful and perfect.  The miso was ok, just average.  The salad, the same.  Overall, nothing special.  I would come back and maybe try something different next time, with the same sauce!",

    "text": "So I've passed this place in Matthews many times but never actually got to try their food until his past weekend.  After running some Sunday errands, made our way over.  This place is a little tucked into the shopping center so you may not see the sign right away.  I still have fond memories of the drive through subway that used to be on the corner of the shopping center, but the Osaka shares the same building as Pizza Spigga which has been there forever as well.  Walk into a large restaurant space... sushi bar on the left and lots of tables on the right.  There's an outdoor seating area with a garden area (not just generic tables with umbrellas).  We were seated promptly (it was 5:30) but some tables were occupied.  One large group and a few scattered about.  Started with a godfather roll as an appetizer and my friend got a Miso soup.  The Godfather roll is indulgent:  tempura crab, cream cheese, alternating tuna and salmon on top, drizzled with aioli and a sauce.  The chicken hibachi (single) was awesome.  I'm used to just having carrots, but they give you zucchini and onions as well which is an added bonus in my book.  You could ask for extra sauce, but I'm a one saucer hibachi-goer... start dipping and then halfway through I pour the rest of the sauce on my remaining hibachi.  Overall, service was friendly and the food was even friendlier to the stomach.  If you leave hungry from this place, there might be something wrong (ask your doctor if you have a possible tapeworm).",

She rushed us to a table and told us our server would be with us shortly. A male waiter took our drink orders. Another guy served them, then our hostess was back asking what we wanted to eat. We placed a sushi order and asked for more time to look at the menu for our meals. She can back as soon as she put our sushi orders in and again we asked for more time. About 5 minutes in total after our sushi order was placed we ordered our meals. Less than 5 minutes after that our main courses were already out and the sushi wasn't. Half way through our meals (that you could tell were pre made) our sushi arrived. We were very displeased with the service we received and the quality of the food. We paid almost $50 for two lunch specials and two rolls of sushi, one of which had broccoli in it and was horrible, we only had one slice each. We were never asked how everything tasted. Drinks went unfilled. Never again.",

The last 3 times I went I was presented with spicy tuna rolls that were not even rolled ! The tuna was falling out everywhere, did not look appetizing or appealing. Also a huge fan of the yaki udon noodles, but those as well were undercooked and the veggies were still hard not soft. Staff is nice & friendly but I just can't come back.
