I loved the atmosphere and the bar decor, it was all very welcoming! I highly recommend this establishment to anyone coming here looking for good food.",

Atmosphere was nice and warm. The only issues we experienced were my chicken pasta had bacon in it and I don't eat pork but they corrected the issue right away. Also my friends steak was really fatty and tough to cut. I am not a big fan of grilled steaks so I couldn't really judge, it looked tasteful to me. But I will say, the chicken pasta was awesome! The manager came and chatted with us and made sure we were satisfied. I would not hesitate to go back to this place, if I ever come back to Charlotte.",

We started with cocktails and they were both great (I got the pineapple martini which was so refreshing and not overly sweet).  We started with the lobster queso which was so good. Not super thick but a perfect consistency and there were nice chunks of lobster. We then both got the spinach salad and every component was delicious. Lastly we both got steaks (me the ribeye and the hubby a chili-rubbed delmonico). They were both cooked to perfection and so tender and buttery.   We were too full for desert but will try them out the next time. We will definitely will go back and try out other items.",

AND I'M OLD!! But--- and that's a big butt in my case---the cheesecake was absolutely fantastic.  A crackly top like a brulee on top of fantastic cheesecake on top of superb crust.

We both ordered burgers.  The wait for the burgers was longer than expected but they were served exactly as ordered and hot off the grill.  I had to say that because several restaurant kitchens on the same caliber as Firebirds refuse to prepare burgers as specified or the server is not writing down the order correctly because they are either served barely warm, the bun is not toasted, the meat is not cooked as ordered or something else is always wrong.    On this occasion of dining at Firebirds, my burger was good but not great like it usually is.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the entire burger because it was good and juicy, it's just that something was missing and I don't know what it was but I'll return and order another burger.  I enjoy the mellow atmosphere Firebirds Wood Fired Grill and the servers are always pleasant and attentive.",

Bread service, etc, but what sets them aside from others is their service. From host stand to dropping the check and the goodbye, they're all there because they want to be. We went there with 8 people a couple weeks ago on a busy Saturday night, it was flawless.",

But to be honest I'm not here to talk about the food, I'm here to make light of the female dress code. The staff is forced to wear silver concho belts that are distractingly trashy. It throws off the entire \"expensive\" vibe they're going for. Whoever makes the women wear these western dangly belts should be shamed. I know you're reading this thinking, \"who cares?\". Well, I cared enough to leave a review about it. I didn't have the guts to tell the manager how unappealing it was. It makes you feel like you're right in an Outback Steakhouse. I really hope the manager reads this and removes the belt law. I'm sorry for being judgmental but we are leaving reviews here.",

This has happened over the course of several months at various times of day. For example, called and asked for a table for 3 on a Thursday. Hostess asked \"For tonight?\" in a very non-friendly tone. I respond yes, to which she goes \"We don't have anything unless you want something for 9pm.\" in a very rushed, irritable voice. I've eaten here a handful of times and like the food okay, but it's a real turn-off when they act like your phone call is such a huge inconvenience. It's honestly prevented me from considering dining here as I've called other restaurants nearby and they are always very friendly even if they're busy. Just know what to expect when you call.",

    "text": "Hey fellow Yelpers, I wanted to write a short review for Firebirds Wood Fired Grill at Stonecrest. My family and I decided to have a dinner out for the first day of the new year here and it was as expected a great time with great food. I say as expected because we've been here many times and only once have we had a issue which was quickly resolved. The food has always been cooked as ordered which is important because I like my steak rare or medium rare and my family enjoys the burgers, salads and seafood. On this evening even though they were busy, our waitress Veronica was excellent, timely and made sure everything was good.  Sometimes it good to make a reservation especially on the weekends otherwise the wait time could take approximately 15 to 30 minutes. The atmosphere and ambiance is very nice, the sound level is average for a steakhouse. The food and appetizers come in big portions so don't fill up on appetizer and bread otherwise you'll be taking a box to go which isn't really a bad thing. The service has always been great and any issues that arise the management has taken care of it quickly and professionally.   The prices are slightly pricey but again the portion sizes are plentiful and you will not leave hungry. Finally, while I can't put Firebirds up there with Mortons, Ruth's Chris or Del Frisco's Double Eagle, etc...Firebirds does well for itself and what they offer. Hope you enjoy your visit.",

If you haven't tried the Pineapple infused Vodka.. you need to do that immediately! It is amazing. Parking can be an issue, but they now have valet at night which has made it much easier. Only drawback is on weekends you are going to be waiting a LONG time for a table, and they struggle a bit with estimating wait times.

    "text": "Living a short skip away from the Stonecrest Firebirds, I have been a frequent diner for many, many years.  Many dates, celebrations, gab fests, Secret Lunch Club meetings and \"I can't believe he did that, what a jerk\" meals, drinks and desserts have taken place at this very restaurant.  I LOVE the Firebirds.  And as with all relationships, great days are easy to weather, it's the fights that test the love.    Today, me and the Firebirds had our first disagreement.  Firebirds is easy to find within the Stonecrest Shopping Center.  Parking is ample and well lit, and it's a short walking distance from the Regal Cinema if you are doing dinner and a movie.  I typically eat dinner here and usually have either the prime rib or the filet, which have always been cooked to perfection and delicious.  Firebirds is a few dollars more than your typical chain steak joints, but your intestinal tract will thank you for spending the few extra dollars by not seizing up from the tenderizers and other chemicals that other places use to make bad cuts of meat taste better.  The BLT salad is delicious.  The 'butt bread'  (delicious warm bread served with butter that looks like a booty) is warm, soft and good.  The onion rings are thick cut onions coated in a seasoned panko crust and served with ranch - YUM!  I don't care for seafood, but my friends swear by the Lobster Queso dip.  Treat yourself and get the loaded baked potato which tastes fresh and not like it has been withering in a steam bath for hours, and is topped with butter, sour cream, cheese, BACON and green onions.  My parents love their crab cake salad.  Spiced green beans with pecans are good, sweet potato waffle fries and steak fries are well done too.  Many years ago they had a pork chop with herbed butter special that I still daydream of.   Big Daddy Chocolate Cake is huge and rich, creme brulee cheesecake is AMAZING creamy goodness and the brownie sundae is yum.  I have never had a bad meal or item here - ever.  Until today.  I took my mom and dad to lunch for my mom's birthday.  Firebirds'  fall lunch specials are a crab cake sandwich and a chicken fried steak.  Both of the parentals got the crab cake sandwich, one with a side of the sweet potato waffle fries and the other with steak fries.  I got the chicken fried steak w/ the gravy on the side, served with the spicy green beans w/ pecans and poblano cheddar mashed potatoes.  I said I wanted the gravy on the side to our waitress twice to make sure that they gravy was indeed served ON THE SIDE.  (you see where this is going, right?)  So the food comes to the table with the gravy on the steak, but whatever, I'll try to eat it.  Normally I am a big fan of gravy, but this was a brown peppercorn gravy and the peppercorn flavor was overwhelming to me, I couldn't even taste the meat (some folks may like it, but I did not).  I looked for our waitress and another young woman came to the table and asked if she could help.  I explained, she took the plate away and returned a moment later to let me know the food was coming right back.  Our original waitress then came over and said she didn't know I wanted it without the gravy (she may not have heard me say it twice) and said it would be out momentarily.  The manager then came over and said it was coming right up.  All very friendly, not pushy or accusatory as if it were my fault.   It was no big, stuff happens.  Mom and dad were happy with their crab cake sammiches and that is the most important thing to me.  Meat came back with no gravy on it, poblano mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious and the green beans were cooked well, not terribly spicy and the pecans gave them an interesting crunch.  I ate it all, life was good.  When the check came, they had taken my chicken fried steak off of the bill, which I ate ALL of on the second try, so they didn't have to do that. I told the waitress that I ate it, so it didn't need to be removed, and she just said it was taken care of.  It's excellent customer service and the immediate correction of a disappointing dish that will keep me coming back to Firebirds for years.  Consistently good food and service have made me a loyal customer.    If only I could find a boyfriend that was so delicious and always treated me as if I were right...",

It can be a bit pricey, but there are a few options that aren't too expensive. I usually get the Aspen Sirloin - It's a lot of meat, very tender, and an excellent choice for the price conscious person that loves steak. Also you MUST try the Lobster Queso dip for an appetizer. No joke, it will literally change your life! And then to top it all off, go with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake! The service is usually very good, but there are always going to exceptions. Overall Firebirds is one of my favorite restaurants, it has great food and it's perfect for romantic dinners or celebrating a special occasion! Also just a side note there is an open kitchen in the back of the restaurant (all stainless steal), where you can see the chefs prepare the food. I personally love this layout in restaurants... Perhaps it just gives me greater comfort that my food is being cooked in a sanitary environment.",

    "text": "Mark me down as unimpressed.  We went on a late Summer evening, arriving about 6:30. The inside was a wait, but the outside was available, and for good reason: The outside pilars and ground was crawling with some sort of beetle infestation. They weren't poisonous or anything, but when we ate we could see them through the metal lattice table, strolling on the underside of the tabletop.  Our server was very good, but the kitchen staff was not. My wife ordered a shrimp salad with \"light dressing\", something the server repeated back to us from the order she had written down, and the salad arrived, soaking in salad dressing.  When the server came back to check on us, my wife mentioned that the salad was swimming in dressing. Our server immediately said she'd have the kitchen make a new one with light dressing. About 5 minutes later, the manager arrived with a new salad, with lettuce on top lightly dressed. Problem solved.  Or so we thought. It turns out, the kitchen staff had simply placed new lettuce on top of the salad my wife had originally had. When she got past the new layer on top, there was her old salad, still awash in salad dressing.  The manager returned, and offered another, new salad. My wife declined, saying that she was full at this point from the earlier appetizer and the lettuce and shrimp she had eaten from the first two iterations of the salad and couldn't possibly eat a third. Nonetheless, the manager returned about 5 minutes later with another salad, which we wound up taking home--she didn't really want it, but there was no sense leaving it behind, even though she said at the time they didn't need to make it.  A measure of a good restaurant is how it deals with mixups and mistakes like this. I confess, I thought the restaurant would have taken the salad off the check--we had ordered an appetizer, my meal and a couple of glasses of wine, so there was still a tab to be paid. But when the check came, the salad was on it. In their eyes, I suppose, their three attempts to get a simple request right was sufficient effort.  As for what I had...I have no recollection of what it was. That is how forgettable it was. I think it was a pasta dish. I know I was eating most of it alone, as my wife's food was off the table twice in the attempts to get her order right.  This restaurant clearly has pretensions of being an upscale dining experience. From what we saw, it has a long way to go before it can claim to have reached that goal. Both of us spent a lot of time that evening looking across the patio to the seating for Cantina 1511, wishing we had walked in their door instead.",

I love the crusted salmon with the fried spinach - enough for dinner and leftovers. The triple diamond martini is insanely good (and at the price they charge, it's good that one drink is all you need). The prices are a touch high, but the food is consistently good and there's always leftovers. I will note on my last trip, I ordered the crab cake salad and discovered the crab cakes, though good, had been changed since my last visit. Too mushy and too much filler now for my taste, but other than that, go, eat and enjoy.",

One of our favorite selections  is tender & delicious Filet Mignon and loaded baked potato. Way better and way cheaper than Ruth Kris. Staff is excellent. Bread board is superb and wine list is decent. No complaints from us.",

It is soaked in pineapple for 21 days. I always start with the Seared Ahi Tuna. The Chile Rubbed Delmonico hits the spot. If you are a big eater, they have lobster tail too. Leave room for dessert. I like their carrot cake.",

Be careful though, I've tried to go over lunch a few times and the place gets packed. During dinner I got a filet which was fantastic. The service was great. I honestly don't have anything to complain about except it gets quite busy. Which obviously is a good thing in general!",

The place is gorgeous both inside and out. The waitresses were all super friendly.   We got the lobster spinach dip as an appetizer...amazing! I got the Durango burger. It was cooked just how I asked and was delicious. One family member got a steak that was fantastic and the other got the Parmesan crusted flounder and an extra crab cake. I tried the crab cake and was amazed at how good it was. The flounder was also amazing, light, full of flavor and moist. Nothing about this meal was disappointing!  The only downside other than the parking was the cocktail menu. A little high and not what I would call a great selection. However, I'm sure that anything from the bar would have been great as the bar was visibly stocked with everything under the sun.  I will DEFINETLY be going back!!!!!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying this review is not about food quality. It's an average of four star food, two star prices, and other typical dining factors.  The food at Firebirds is great, but for what I spent for two steak dinners and a few drinks my last time there with my girlfriend, it cost more than my upcoming tenth anniversary dinner cruise without the cruise.    The waitress was excellent, but nothing special. She was a stereotypical waitress.  The restaurant itself is always busy.  In fact, last time we went we had to go elsewhere because the wait was an hour and a half.  I typically don't mind a half hour wait, which is what we ended up waiting last night, but in that time several staff members stared at us craning our necks to see a spot open at the bar without ever asking is we would like a drink or menu while we waited.  Considering how small the bar is, it is just always an issue there.  We did eventually get a table in the bar, which cut down on our wait time, but then we saw other patrons, who were just arriving, getting drinks and appetizers around the big fireplace.  Why didn't anybody ask us about doing this while we stood by the door looking rather irritated for a half hour? I am somewhat relieved that they didn't, though, because at either $5 for a beer or $9 for a liquor drink, we could have spent the entire budget at the bar in twenty minutes.  I must sound cheap or like an alcoholic, but that is not it at all.  Restaurants with congestion like this need to have options for patrons who will almost definitely have to wait.  Those options should include a light cheap appetizer menu, where the average price isn't $12, wait service for the waiting area, which already has tables for drinks, and a drink menu that will not break people before they ever sit down.    I understand that it is near a rich area, but it's still on the fringe, and by a theater and a Wendy's.  It's not Ruth's Chris, but they sure want to pretend that it is.  In case I am just beginning to sound cheap again, let me reiterate that we could have eaten uptown at McCormick and Schmick's for the same price, and had options like the Belk Theater for dessert as opposed to Front row seats for Jurassic Park 3d across the parking lot.  My suggestion, if you plan to eat at Firebird's, is to have a reservation, be there early, ask about drinks and appetizers while you wait, because they won't offer, budget to spend around $40-$50 on two mixed drinks for two people, order a burger, because it is the only thing priced reasonably on the whole menu, then leave quickly because they don't hide that they want to free up the table after they have gotten $120 out of you.    Bottom line, for me anyway, only go there to get burgers with friends or other couples, don't be starving because you will be starving a lot worse after the wait, and don't go there for drinks or the bar scene.",

FOOD * Appetizer: Lobster Spinach Queso - FANTASTIC. You can really taste the lobster in the cheese dip. The tortilla chips that come with it are just aite.  * Appetizer: Onion Rings with ranch dressing - classic. It's got a nice crunch and the ranch dressing goes well with all that is fried.  * Wood Grilled Salmon - really nicely cooked salmon that is crispy on the edges, firm on the outside, and tender/moist in the middle. Came with DELICIOUS parmesan mashed potatoes with pieces of the potato skin adding a nice texture to the creamy mashed potatoes.   ATMOSPHERE * Reminds me of a mix between a pintrest elegant ski cabin with dark woods and grey rocks, a seasons 52, and a pinch of Cheesecake Factory. So.. quite nice. * Slightly too noisy to be able to hear the person across the table. Had to raise my voice a bit.  SERVICE * Disorganized. One waitress came to get our drink order and share the dinner specials, then another waiter came and did the same thing. Even though we had two waiters, they still managed to skip over taking down someone's drink order. Overall, service was slightly awkward.   RANDOM * Plating was awkward. It seems like they just put the food on the plate in clumps. The presentation was not very appealing. Some plates were too big for the amount of food on it.  * It was happy hour when we got there, meaning cocktail drinks were only $5. Win!",

My wife enjoyed a delicious Colorado Chicken Salad and a glass of wine from the restaurant's impressive selection. There's also a decent menu of local craft beers, although the options were a bit disappointing, considering the wide selection of breweries in and around Charlotte.  Firebirds is a decent spot for dinner and drinks in South Charlotte, although the beer menu could use some work. Definitely worth another visit.",

The coconut shrimp was tender and not greasy with a delicious sweet tropical  sauce. My prime rib was cooked to perfection  with a creamy horseradish sauce  and my dining mates strip steak also cooked to perfection. The salmon was tender and moist also topped with a wonderful sauce . I ordered mushrooms in port sauce as a side for a potato substitute, very delicious.  We would definitely return for another  enjoyable dinner",

I understand it can get busy during peak hours but not one server was courteous enough to ask if we had even been waited on. I expected better service from a more upscale restaurant.",

At last minute I was calling around looking for a restaurant that was willing to cook for my party of 25. We are celebrating an engagement and wanted to celebrate somewhere nice in the Charlotte area. The location is outside of downtown and it happened to be a little further than what I wanted but they were willing to accommodate such a large party at the last minute. Great service as they were willing to take on the task of cooking for such a large group and the food was fantastic. The ambience was great as well. The prices aren't that bad as I would consider this fine dining.  **Please pardon my mistakes as I'm using Siri to dictate",

    "text": "They must be making a killing.  This is in a stand-alone building near the mall, in an upscale area and the interior decor is very upscale, they call it \"polished casual.\"  The menu is oriented towards steak and seafood prepared with a live fuel or wood-fired grill.  I really did like the setting.  It also has a little bit of the outdoors or Pacific Northwest feel to the decor with the stone and wood as well as the giant Elk head above the entrance. The menu has a wide variety of options with a lot of bold flavors like \"chile rubbed\" and \"au Poivre,\" \"key lime butter,\" etc.  My lunch entree was no different, a basic turkey club served on \"jalapeno bread\" with roasted red pepper mayo and applewood smoked bacon.  I also started with a cup of the everyday tortilla soup with sour cream and scallion.  The soup was excellent, I really liked the flavors and the tortilla's remained crisp.  Portion size was good for a \"cup\" of soup, really it was more like 12 ounces and nice and hot through and through so it contrasted well with the cool sour cream.  I did not think it was particularly spicy, but it was \"bold.\"  The only disappointment was the sandwich, and that was with the jalapeno bread.  I expected a little more boldness out of the bread and possibly that it had jalapeno pieces in the bread itself, but it may have been dusted with jalapeno spice or such as you find on the jalapeno flavored potato chips at the grocery.  I really did not pick up the jalapeno flavor in any noticeable way.  The portion size of the sandwich was generous and cut into quarters, unfortunately, the ingredients were not distributed within each quarter in a consistent manner so it was like eating a slightly different sandwich from quarter to quarter, mainly with the amount of turkey, tomato and bacon in each (if any).  So I re-assembled and it was fine.  The tater tots were great, crispy and plentiful.  It likely is the case that upon serving the chef grabs a handful of tots out of the bin and dumps them on the plate in a scattered about way.  My guests had the smokehouse burger and the American Kobe Beef Meatloaf - both cleaned their plates, and reported it was very good. Servers all wear black shirts and jeans presenting a polished look for the wait staff and everyone was friendly.  Bill was about $20 per person. I'll have to visit my hometown location, just never have gotten to it due to traffic avoidance at its location.",

    "text": "I am fairly new to the area, moved in in November. I just want to shout out a restaurant for such Amazing, Incredible, Above and Beyond, Five Star Service!!  Firebirds in Stonecrest is that place!!! I recently planned a 30th birthday celebration for my daughter. All she wanted was a taco truck for her birthday! After weeks of searching we finally found one that was available. We booked him and continued our planning. The day of the party just 3 hours before he was supposed to arrive he calls to tell me that the suspension on his truck broke. Disappointed but not upset i told him i am sorry about the truck. I know it is his livelihood. He offers me a taco bar in place. Ok so now i need to add a table to my last minute to do list. As I speak to Mike I realize that something isnt right.  He offers me 2 proteins for the Taco Bar (but we would have had a full menu with a truck), he now wants to charge me $100 per hour to have one person serve(caterers dont charge that much), vegetables for our Vegan guests are now an extra fee. When I question as to why all the extra fees and if he can waive the server fee, his response was \"i am already discounting you the delivery charge, and not charging you for the veggies.\" My confusion is this would have all have been a part of the truck service! Food would have been delivered, in the truck, someone would have served the food, in the truck, veggies would have been included with the full menu, in the truck! After asking about all this he says that \"Unfortunately at this point I don't feel I have the ability to make you happy. I'm going to have to respectfully withdraw my offer. I have refunded your food truck deposit. I apologize for the inconvenience. \". In tears because now my guests will be there in 2 hours we start to scramble. Thank God for Firebirds!!!! They totally Came through for us!!!! They gave us enough food for all 50 guests!!! Victoria and the crew there Rock!!!!! Taco GreenGo you need to learn from them!!! I just feel people should be recognized for such amazing deeds!! Sorry so long !!",

For starters we order the ranch rings which are like onion rings. They are fantastic. This is also one of those restaurants with great bread and butter. For my lunch I get the turkey club. The only thing I've been upset with this establishment is the stopped serving the sweet potato waffle fries which were my favorite. They were the perfect side dish for a sandwich at lunch. I recommend this place as well during dinner with a date. The environment is fantastic.",

    "text": "I got into Charlotte after a long day of work, then flying.  So, I was ready for a drink and something yummy.  My girlfriend brought me here, my first visit, her second.  It was definitely hopping on a Thursday night.  It was full except for 2-3 tables in the restaurant, 2 cocktail tables in the bar area, and one bar stool. We jumped on an open cocktail table gladly not having to wait.  They had quite a nice drink menu, several different cocktail, martini choices.  I just went with something simple, and friend with a draft beer. Our cocktail waitress wasnt exactly cheery, friendly, or attentive.  After sitting several minutes with an empty drink, she came around, not to ask us if we'd like another drink, etc, but to let us know that she was leaving and we needed to pay.  I can't remember exactly how she worded it, but both myself and friend are/have been in the industry for years, and we were both shocked at the way she'd said this to us.  While of course we said we'd pay her out if she was cut, I just wish, after her already not-so-great attitude, that she would have worded it differently/approached it differently.  On top of that, lol and I know this might make me sound bad, but it had been a LONG day, and it was chill time, we ended up waiting almost another 5-7 minutes before we even saw our next server to get another round of drinks.  This is something that I feel strongly about, especially during these transer/server-takeover situation, that the customer not be able to tell because the transition is so smooth.  Either way, our next server, Debbie, was great!  She quickly picked up and made the rest of our evening Great!! After my friend telling me several great choices, I decided on the Wood Grilled Salmon with a baked potato, and steamed veggies.  Even though I had several changes to make to the dish bc of dietary restrictions, the waitress said several times,  \"We will make it however you want us to.\"  I really dont go out to eat all that much, because it can be such a hard time trying to get something I can eat, but not make the kitchen have to do too much.  She was definitely the most accomodating I've dealt with, concerning ordering.  My friend decided on the Fried Chicken Salad, no honey mustard, sub Balsamic. When our food came, it looked so appetizing.  My salmon, though completely plain was absolutely the tastiest salmon I've ever had, and cooked to a perfect medium, per my request.  Friend said the salad was great, the balsamic was a great choice.  Oh, and they had brought us a nice round of bread to start with.As we finished up, Debbie boxed my food for me.  We finished up with getting a dessert to go, and another round of drinks. Overall, the whole meal was super.  The building itself has such a warm feeling; the colors and smell from open cook line and the fireplace in the bar definitely added to that glowing ambiance.  I will be back here the next time I'm in town for sure.  It was swanky, yet not expensive for what we got. And of course, I recommend our waitress Debbie, who totally rocked it.",

Don't go for a gourmet experience, go for a great steak and their best dish - a regular old baked potato that they somehow make into something great.  Salads are good as well.  Service is OK, perhaps closer to a chain than a high end restaurant but you never get ignored and problems are dealt with swiftly.  My kids love the \"Big Daddy\" chocolate cake.",

    "text": "Loaded with son, daughter-in-law, wife and two grandchildren we are frequent diners at Firebirds.  Given the children we come early, prior to 6pm and have no problem getting seated immediately.  We leave after dinner moving through the crowd in front waiting for a table.  Service is great.  Kid menu is better than average and they will get the children's meals ready quickly.  Helps keep them quiet and happy.  Portions are wonderful.  Food is well prepared and excellent.  On one occasion I ordered the prime rib which came over cooked.  I can handle medium rare to medium, but not more or less.  This truly beautiful piece of meat came in rare enough to quiver. I hated to ask them to cook it more, as I knew that it would come back too done.  So it was, but I ate it and appreciated that they did re-cook it.  When the bill came, they comp-ted my meal.  I talked to the manager telling him that I wanted to pay for it as it was excellent and that I did not want to see a good piece of meat thrown out.  He insisted that the meal was on the house.  Unnecessary as far as I am concerned, but  that is the culture and policy of Firebird.  Their BLT salad is worth being a meal, and sometimes my son and I do just that.  The portion is generous and if you order it with your main course you will not finish your main.  Suggest you split the BLT salad with someone.  But baby, it is really a yumilicious treat.  Baked potatoes come with lots of toppings. But be aware that the spuds are rolled in heavy salt while baking and though I love the skins I just can't take the salt, even if I wipe it off.  But the potatoes are great.  We have not had a bad meal and have really worked through the menu so can confidently tell you to order what you want as you will not be disappointed.",

I told the server. I did NOT ask for a replacement or for it to be taken off my bill. I discretely told the server to let the bartender know in case there was an issue. A manager came over (interrupting a conversation) to inform me that I must be mistaken, because HE tried the tonic water, and it was just fine. Well, thanks for telling me that I was wrong!   I have tended bar, managed a bar and worked in the hospitality industry. As a paying diner, I LOVE being told that I am wrong! Thanks for letting me know that I must have IMAGINED my watery vodka & tonic! Next time I will know better.  BTW, the drink in question wasn't removed from my check. I was with guests so I just shut up, paid up and will vote with my wallet next time.",

Last weekend we made an opentable reservation last. I think they don't understand what reservations are because we got handed a buzzer just like everyone else and we saw multiple people going up to the hostess desk complaining about this very thing. People don't make a reservation just to be given a buzzer as if we had just walked in the door. This place was packed even at 830/9pm. I thought for some reason thought this was a more high end place but there were people wearing sweatpants and t shirts while dining. Once we were seated things were fine. Our waitress (Steph) was seriously so sweet and personable and attentive. Spicy shrimp appetizer was SO good. We had two nice glasses of wine. I had the Mahi, good but I won't rush back just for that. My husband had a strip. Ordered medium but came out more on the rare side (cold and red). We hate to do this but just aren't comfortable eating it cooked that way, it had to be sent back. Our waitress was wonderful about it and when it came back out more pink than red he was happy. Also we did see managers bussing food and pitching in which is always nice to see and appreciated. Overall OK experience but I can think of other places I'd rather spend over $100 on dinner for two.",

People ordered variations of pastas and steaks and salmon, I had the key lime butter salmon with a crab cake and sweet potato waffle fries as well as a BLT side salad (don't judge we were celebrating anyway) everything was cooked to perfection and full of flavor and you could tell how fresh everything was. I didn't have room for dessert but I wish I had it looked to die for.   Parking is easy they have a semi private lot. Good for groups but I can tell they get extremely busy.

The service was exceptionally attentive, our food was cooked to perfection, and each course came out at the perfect moment. Never too soon or left us waiting too long. The hand crafted drinks were incredible and really captured the season we were in.  (mmmm.. Bourbon and Peaches!)  The food was just as exceptional as the service and while side dishes were somewhat steakhouse standard familiar (Mac and Cheese), they had special little twists to set it apart (Green Chile Mac and Cheese!!)  The only slight disappointment was the dessert. We ordered the Warm Brownie sundae and the brownie was ice cold It was still soft and yummy, just not hot/warm or gooey. When we commented on the temp to the server (not complaining since we ate 3/4rs of it), he apologized profusely and removed it immediately from the bill.  I've been to dozens of local and chain steakhouses across the country like The Palm, Wolfgang's, Capital Grille, Sante Fe Steakhouse of Killington, etc... This is by far the best \"chain\" steakhouse location you could ever want to visit. Worth every last penny spent!",

The hostesses, waitress, and the manager all seemed like this was their first time working in a restaurant. They weren't bad by any means but I weirdly felt like I was eating surrounded by high schoolers.   Anyways I got my usual sesame crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and pecan green beans. My mom got the meatloaf with the same sides I got. We waited for awhile, probably a good 20 minutes, when one of the managers came over. She seemed very nervous and told me that our food was taking longer than usual because they burnt my salmon. They said they'd like to give us a free dessert as a result. When the food finally came out it was good, not great. I definitely don't think the high prices reflect the quality.  Even though I felt like I was in a high school work study it's still a decent place to get dinner on occasion. I give them three stars because when compared with other places in the same price point they fall a bit short.",

    "text": "I have dined at FB's several times in various states over the years. After my last lunch there, I have to say that the quality and service at this particular location have gone  way down. I went here for lunch the week before Christmas with two other people. Initially two of us ordered soup and salad combo and added a crab cake to the salad, for an additional cost.  The other party got the chicken tortilla soup and I tried the soup of the day which was Black bean.   When my soup arrived there were very few black beans in it, mostly onion, celery and tomatoes. I had to exchange it for the chicken tortilla which was tasty but could have had more chicken in it. The salads were okay but the crab cakes were very small and very bready, not much crab taste.   The third person in our party ordered the the portabello mushroom sandwich. She expected he mushroom and tomato and onion garnishments to be grilled and warm. They were not.  The sandwich was cold. Also there was supposed to be feta on the sandwich and she tasted none. She sent it back and got a soup and salad combo.  We attempted to follow up with or waiter but he was not very attentive. Finally we contacted the manager. He was apologetic and took off the sandwich and did not charge her for the combo which we appreciated. He tried to make it right, and I give him credit for that.  We had dined here earlier in the year and had a disappointing meal. It feels like FB is cutting corners but not the prices. The food is not cheap but it is not of good quality. And there is really no excuse for poor service. You have to train your people to come back, check on diners, ask if everything is okay, refill glasses etc.  Our server was absolutely clueless. If serving is not your thing, you need another line of work. We typically tip 18-20% but this server was lucky to get the basic 15%. I don't see us returning there any time soon.",

The atmosphere, customer service , food and drinks were outstanding. While I'm not a steak person...next visit I will indulge as there steaks and potatoes looked very tasteful.

Instead of giving you a buzzer thing, they take/confirm your phone number and text you when your table is ready. (Hint: Make sure the number they have is for the phone you are carrying!) Anyway, kind of a neat idea... first time I've seen that. There was a good crowd there, especially in the bar area, so things were pretty noisy. We had trouble hearing across the table. Zack, our server, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and competent... he was quite good.  I had the American Kobe beef meatloaf with parmesan mashed potatoes. The meatloaf came to the table piping hot, and covered with a good mushroom sauce that had a bit of a spicy kick. It was delicious! We appreciated the gluten-free menu and choices for my wife. She had the grilled shrimp and strawberry salad and it was excellent. She said she would absolutely get it again.  We would definitely return to this restaurant. My only negative (one star off) was the noise level.",

What was Above Average     - The house side salad was very tasty and the pecans were awesome     - The Ranch Dressing with the Onion Rings & salad was very very good     - The Southwestern Au Gratin Potatoes were awesome!   What was Okay/Average     - Spinach Crab Dip was so-so.  The tri-color chips looked nice, but the taste was bland.     - Liked the fresh baked bread, but the butter was hard as a rock and was impossible to spread      - The Steaks were average, cooked as ordered, but I am just not a big fan of grilled steaks.  The others with me really enjoyed there steaks though.   What I really Thinks Needs to Be improved - the noise level.  My gosh, we had 5 at our table and couldn't hear anyone but those at our sides.  Our poor waitress had to walk next to each person to take our orders.  Would  seriously recommend they hang some tapestries or something from the ceiling and/or add some decorations that will help absorb sound.",

    "text": "3 stars for the service, 2 stars for the food.   Seems there's a quality control problem in the kitchen.  1. Pretzels with beer cheese: took over 25 minutes to come out and the cheese was so watered down you couldn't dip without it dripping all over.  2. Ribeye: ordered Med-rare. Server confirmed warm, red center and husband said yes, almost bleeding. Came out Med-well and tough as nails. Tough Ribeye? Hmmm 3. Caesar salad: drowning in very garlicky dressing. Shaved parm on top was great, as were the croutons. Could have used less than half the dressing.  4. Parmesan mashed potatoes: Bland. Like so bland. Had to use salt. ?? 5: side veggies: well seasoned and still a little crunchy. Very good 6. Baked potato: asked for everything on the side but it came on top - luckily bacon on side as it has clearly been sitting around for some time. Cheese tasted fake- like shredded velveeta, no butter as promised- only sour cream. And chives.   Will give it one more shot since everyone from the bartender to server to two managers we had contact with were very nice. One nasty hostess, but hey, it's cool. Everyone has an off day.",

Tuna, Shrimp, and Wings. For the main course I decided to take her up on the encrusted Prime Rib. The rest of my group ordered a mix of meats and fish.  Food didn't take too long to come out and let me tell you, everyone quieted down when the food came because it was very, very good.  My prime rib was done to perfection and I ate the entire thing.  Dessert choices were made...chocolate cake and pumpkin cheesecake.....recommendations again.....good ones!  Everyone left fat & happy. I would recommend this place!!!",

Food knowledge low, we had 3 staff members service us as we had a bit of food from the regular menu. Folks just didn't seem engaged and focused although they are running a contest for their \"club- promotions.\"  Hey many better choices, so that is what we will do. Sorry.",

While we waited for a table we grabbed a drink from the bar, the drink was not what we expected and this was expressed during the visit. Once we were seated we placed our order immediately due to the large volume in the restuarant at the time, and it still was well after 9pm before our food arrived. I ordered the ribs or so I thought because what I was served most definitely did not look like ribs. The food was absolutely horrible especially for the amount of money that I spent. The best part of the meal was the salad that I could have gotten anywhere, and saved myself 40 bucks. The customer service was fair for the most part, but the overall experience will result in me not returning.",

    "text": "First off, restaurant was clean and inviting.  We got there around 4:30 PM and was seated immediately. Even when we left around 6:30, there was still plenty of seating available.  Hostess was pleasant and friendly, server was exceptional.  Her name was Victoria and she did everything you would want from a server and more.  Didn't have to ask for drink refills, took our order and made sure everything was served to our preference, friendly, courteous, professional and yet kept everything real.  Victoria did not rush us, always asked if there was anything else we wanted/needed, and made sure we were satisfied. Stayed to talk about her and the restaurant at our musing but still kept a lively pace throughout the evening with all the other tables she was serving.  Watching the rest of the staff do their thing, this place got crowded and busier as the evening progressed.  Saw multiple servers serving an almost packed dining room and they didn't skip a beat.  The only negative I could give this place, if I had to, is that I didn't notice a manager or person in charge.  Maybe they don't need one, if everyone is doing their jobs so efficiently. It would have been nice for him/her to come around and say, \"Hello\" and see how satisfied we were with everything. We were ready to give rave reviews on every aspect of our visit!  As far as food is concerned...it was beyond words. We all wanted to try some prime cuts of meat so we ordered the ribeyes and, at the recommendation of Victoria, the prime rib.  Ribeyes were delicious.  Cooked to perfection, juicy, just the right amount of rare/medium rare you want to get the juices to work with the marbling of the cut.  Outstanding flavor and a good sized portion.  The prime rib...I don't know how to explain it.  I got the smaller cut because I also ordered the Caesar salad and a bowl of the clam chowder and had dessert before the meal.  Wish I had ordered the larger cut. It was out of this world delicious.  I have never had a cut of beef that was so tender, so juicy, so flavorful, so incredibly mouthwatering, so easy to cut (I was cutting it with my fork), so outstanding that I know where I will go out for steak/prime rib every time I am in the Charlotte area.  I didn't have to, but reluctantly shared a bite with my friends of the Prime Rib that they said it was hard to go back to their Ribeyes. The Prime Rib was so incredible, along with everything else about this visit that my friends and I joked about the Prime Rib is Victoria's Secret!  Absolutely, the best choice we could have made for our meals and the fortune to have Victoria as our server.    Not only do I recommend trying this place but if you have the good fortune of having Victoria (or any of the servers, based on what we saw), you will have an incredible evening and one of your most fantastic meals of your life!",

    "text": "I've been to this Firebird's a few times but this review is based on my most recent visit on May 11, 2010 for lunch.  There were 8 of us for a business lunch.  4 of us are larger than normal men.  We were placed at one of the round tables that may have fit 8 smaller people comfortably but we were all uncomfortable at this table as there was no room to move once we were seated.  The should say something when they give your drink orders that it's going to be a while until you see a refill.  Eventually everyone received a refill except for me.   What's so hard about refilling unsweetened iced tea?    On the meal, i asked for a side green salad without the pecans that came with it.  I watched the server write this down so something got screwed between typing it into the ordering system and the preparer because the salad came out with pecans on it.  I'm allergic to pecans but I picked them out anyway the best i could.  I should have sent it back.  At this point I'm still waiting for a refill on my tea as the rest of my table gets refills on their drinks.    Finally the meal comes out and I am able to snag another server to refill my tea.    I ordered a pasta dish.  Well the penne pasta was undercooked.  At this point I feel I'm a customer at Hell's Kitchen.  So I drink my tea.  Wrong move.    The server came around to check refills on drinks and was noting everyone.. Twice I had to tell her to refill mine as she missed it the first time she marked it down on her mental list.  Finally a refill.  But it was gone in no time.  Do I dare ask for another one?  Well I wasn't paying for this meal but I were, I wouldn't have tipped well and it only instance of bad service for me to stay away.  This may be it for me.",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend here for his birthday because I heard they were known for good steaks. The ambiance here (Rea Road Location) is real masculine with the dark wood and dim lights. He really enjoyed the decor and felt it was fitting for the occasion.   We got the Lobster Spinach Queso and OMG it was so freakin good! I pretty much ate the whole thing myself! He got the 14 oz Ribeye and I got the Wood Grilled Salmon. Yum to the salmon. It was cooked to perfection! It came with parmesan mashed potatoes which were creamy and good. Nothing like I have ever had before. My boyfriend enjoyed his Ribeye of course and it was cooked Medium just like he wanted it. He claims it was one of the best steaks he has ever had.   Overall Firebirds is great and the service was awesome. Fine dining at its best!",

The garlic potatoes were a little dry for my taste and I did not like them. The chocolate cake delicious . We will be back. It was worth the trip from Rock Hill.",

    "text": "Here's something weird.  I love Firebirds.  The food is usually very good, and the prices are not ridiculous.  You can get a great steak without paying DelFrisco's prices.   Last night, my girlfriend and I dined at this Firebirds.  We had the lobster queso, split a BLT salad, and I had the bleu cheese filet, while she had the chicken pasta.   Everything was spectacular.  Bottom line.  However, a couple hours after eating there, she started feeling nauseous.  About an hour after that, I started feeling the same way. Her suffering was much worse than mine, but something we ate simply didn't agree with either of us.  I'm blaming the lobster queso, simply because it's incredibly rich, full of cream, and we both ate a lot.  Plus, besides the bread and salad, it's the only thing we shared.   Another thing I should mention is that we both had a double black-diamond martini; these are absolutely heavenly.  I sure hope they didn't have anything to do with the GI distress, as I'll certainly have more in the future. I'm treating the stomach thing as a fluke, as this is my 5th or 6th trip to Firebird's, and I've never had a problem before.  I'll add another star after my next pain-free visit.  :)",

They had Dogfish Head and I said \"60 minute\" or \"90 minute\"?  The waiter said \"Dogfish\".  I said \"which one?\"  He said \"Dogfish\"  So I said \"Who's on first, what's on second and I don't know's on third.\"  And then I ordered a lemonade because $1 went to finding a cure for cancer.  The lemonade was awful.  Just a cup of sugar including sugar drizzled on the rim of the glass.  Desserts were good.  But they gave us a really long skinny fork that was more like chopsticks.  Ever tried to eat ice cream or cheesecake with chopsticks?  Uh, yeah.  My co-patrons ordered steaks and reviews were mixed.  I ordered some kind of encrusted salmon.  OK.  The fried spinach was good but too salty.  Back to the huge portions.  Michelle Obama would not be a happy camper here.  They could change the name from Firebirds to Obesebirds.  It was too much.  I'm still in a daze from going here.  Sorry, but there are so many better restaurants at a much better price.",

Have you ever wished for a restaurant that has the perfect atmosphere, perfect service, amazing menu, huge wine selection, did I mention perfect service, great prices...THE place to go when you want the best of the best???  Well my foodie friends, THIS IS THE PLACE!  I have been here probably 40+ times with as few as two people, and as many as 8 people, and have never ever had bad food or service.  In fact, it is always SUPERIOR!      The food is fresh, hot and delicious, as well as inventive and portioned generously.  The atmosphere is fantastic....want a bar with food and tv's...they have it.  Want a softly lit dining room with a fireplace and good music...they have it.  Table, booth..it doesn't matter.  The servers are always super attentive, professional, courteous, friendly, and fun.  The wine selection is incredible.  The steaks are fresh and always cooked how you order them, the chicken is juicy and fresh, the hamburgers are mouth-watering, the seafood tastes like it was just caught, and the salads (especially the Colorado Chicken salad with goat cheese instead of blue) are huge, fresh, and tossed with the perfect amount of dressing every time.  Now, for all this, you would think the prices would be really high...they are NOT!  i have spent more at Chili's for far less!!  Whether it is a romantic dinner, casual dinner with friends/family, or a special place to take visitors from out of town, this is the one and only place I have been to in Charlotte that excels in every category time and time again!  Hats off to Firebirds for allowing me to spend a generous amount of my income enjoying the best food in my life there!",

The first night, I had some sort of pasta dish; I can't remember what it was called right now, but it basically tasted like a poorly executed Thai panang curry, except instead of using noodles, it had ziti and it had bacon in it.  The second time I ate here, I tried the ribeye steak because my dining companions raved about how great the steak was.  The ribeye was definitely flavorful, but it wasn't at all tender.  It was pretty tough.  Kinda disappointing, actually.    The highlight of my meal at Firebird's was the creme brule cheese cake.  That's gotta be the best cheesecake I've had in a while.  So, if you like cheesecake, give this place a try.",

Ordered take out when we had company, called at 6:30 and was told 25 min, arrived at 7:00 and was told by the hostess our 'server' would be with us shortly. Stood there until 7:10 and asked the hostess about our food and she seemed surprised no one spoke with us yet (while I was standing in front of the hostess stand the whole time).  Finally got the food at 7:18, paid and left, we ordered two of the pineapple chicken entrees - got home and saw it was just plain grilled chicken - they forgot the pineapple salsa on the pineapple chicken! I wish I checked it before I left but after waiting almost an hour for a take out order that was supposed to be ready in 25 min I just wanted to get back home. Meanwhile the food was COLD so I'm pretty sure it was ready when i got there at 7:00 and they just didn't get their act together to bring me my order. It was so embarrassing serving cold food to our guests and 'pineapple' chicken without the pineapple!",

They were quick to replace them but the taste just wasn't there for me. We also had the coconut shrimp for an appetizer and they were little overcooked and I need to get very much for almost $12. To put this in perspective my main dish which were the ribs were only $12 as well. I do believe in giving places more than one opportunity to impress me so we will try it again hopefully it was just an off day.",

I decided upon the 9 oz. filet & crab cake special, but when it arrived the filet was slightly cold and tasted of smoke, although the meat was very tender.  What really disappointed me was the crab cake being about the size of a silver dollar, easily the smallest I've ever been served, and even at that size it was somehow light on crabmeat.  The accompanying mashed potatoes were also quite cold and lumpy.  Had the \"special\" been some kind of reduced price then the ridiculously small portion might have been understandable, but it was quite expensive.    The one positive I will say is that the service was very good, as the waitress was very attentive and came by to check regularly without being obtrusive.  Still, it's definitely not somewhere I will ever dine again and I will discourage any friends from doing so should they go to that particular theater.",

    "text": "Well, I hadn't been to Firebirds in a few years and never had visited the location in Stonecrest before, but it was an easy and convenient choice before we saw a movie earlier this week. Really, you can park at either the theatre in Stonecrest or in front of Firebirds and everything is walkable. Really dig that about this location.   The interior: Awesome. It's like walking into a swanky lumberjack's den. There's exposed wood, firewood, more wood....and wooden things. Dimly lit, high ceilings, lanterns....or \"man\"terns, for that matter. Just a really cool feel. I really like the split level, too.   Our service was VERY attentive. I really can't stress how much this guy wanted to serve us. His name was Brett and he was thorough, nice, educated, and well-placed throughout the meal.   We started with their signature cocktail -- Black Diamond Martini. I have to say it was a total letdown. Their infused citron vodka was like dull pineapple juice. It housed no kick and was just....meh. I mean, I really dig pineapple juice, but $10 pineapple juice? Think I'll pass.  I have to comment on the bread they serve pre-meal. What IS that loaf? I've never seen that shape, structure, or texture in bread before! Coated in semolina...which gets all over you and the table, by the way, and is almost cracker-like on the exterior with a slight chew in the middle. It tastes just fine, but man....what a strange recipe/method.   I ordered the coconut shrimp for an entree. I've been on a kick of ordering things I normally wouldn't on a given night. Sigh....it was just boring. 10 semi-large shrimp, a cabbage slaw with tortilla chips, large steak fries, and an awful mango-habanero dipping sauce. The shrimp were fine au naturale, but that dipping sauce totally ruins everything. I'd rather have ketchup and that's really bad.   I love the decor and the service. The food and sig cocktail....not so much. I'd love to come back and just sit at the bar with a beer before a movie, though! I'ma get my plaid on, kick back and enjoy that wood-laden ambiance!

    "text": "Lots of good memories in this restaurant.  I know it tends to get crowded at times, but I think my family and I have lucked out (or we either plan for an early dinner when we come here).  Our server Nadie was awesome on Friday.  We had a large group of six and she was very knowledgeable about the specials and also the wine list when we asked for recommendations.  I had the Chicken and Pasta... which she warned me about the spice.  I told her to \"bring it on\" and the pasta, chicken, and sauce were excellent.  Our table also tried the lobster queso - which was scarily addicting... watch out or you may fill yourself up with bread and this appetizer dip.  It comes with chips, but the bread dipped in it was the best combination ever.  I don't know what came over me, but I finished my entire portion.  I did run a 5k the next morning, and felt a little on the heavier side when I woke up, but it gave me some good fuel to burn off.",

With Java bbq sauce, applewood-smoked bacon, cheddar, and red onion on a fresh baked bun this burger is probably the freshest burger on the planet and makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The bbq sauce is divine, the cheddar is freshly crumbled, the bun is so fresh it comes out with flour still on it. Take one bite and any burger aficionado will see the simple ingredients and attention to execution make this one of the Best Burgers in Charlotte.",

The manager noticed me eyeing the steak this time, and he insisted I let him take it back. They cooked some of it to mid-rare, but the rest came out medium, which I was afraid of. My wife's salad with shrimp and goat cheese came out without goat cheese. They corrected it. This is a good restaurant, but I can cook a way better steak at home. I'll stick with the meatloaf from now on.",

Part of our order was a piece of key lime pie (theirs is great) which the manager threw in as a sort of a gift and he also honored the coupon.

    "text": "I loved everything about this place. The delicious sounding menu, the ambiance and especially the customer service.   Stopped in when it was busy. There was a wait for a table but hubs and I were able to score a couple of seats at the bar. Upon being seated we ordered a couple of brews and started debating what we were going to order.   I love that the menu is not overly complicated- there are plenty of selections but not enough to make your head spin like some other places. Even though there wasn't an overwhelming amount of choices everything sounded so good that it made making a decision difficult.   Ended up ordering a burger and after what seemed like just a few short minutes (love when you have good company to make time fly!) the food arrived. The burger I ordered was supposed to come with bacon but it was missing. I didn't really mind this so I didn't say much. I then asked to see the menu b/c in my debating on what to order I thought I remembered seeing the burger with bacon option cost more than what I had received.   I expressed my price question to the bartender as I was looking at the menu and realized that I had mixed things up in my head and there was, in fact, no price difference. She was quick to verify there was no price difference but also quick to offer to go and get me bacon from the back to eat with the remainder of my burger, which I declined.   I was ready to move on with it and was feeling a little embarrassed that I asked about the price b/c I had mixed things up when the manager showed up, apologized for the missing bacon and offered to buy us desert.   We finished our meals and were too stuffed to think about desert. The bartender then insisted we should take it to go and I have to tell you, I had the most delicious breakfast of  chocolate cake the following day that my mouth still waters thinking about it.   The way that we were treated after what was basically my mistake for reading the menu wrong and a little missing bacon has made me a real fan of this place. It is refreshing to see places take pride in what they are serving and caring how the customer is treated when so many places seem to not care anymore and this will make me a repeat customer for a long time to come.",

    "text": "Yesterday I surprised my husband with a date night to your Stonecrest location. With small kids, and three home businesses, this is not a normal thing for us. We were greeted sincerely and warmly and shown immediately to a table. Our server, Casey, was sweet and genuine. She was informative and attentive, even as more people were seated in her section. My husband ordered the chile-rubbed delmonico, medium-rare. When it came, with its huge loaded baked potato side, he got a few bites in and realized it was quite rare, more than he was comfortable with. We never send food back. Ever. But it was just too rare. We asked Casey if it could be cooked for a few more minutes and she could not have been more apologetic, even though it clearly wasn't her fault. When it came back out, the manager Matt brought it to the table with another loaded potato, and asked my husband if he wouldn't mind checking the center for done-ness. My husband said it looked great, even a little bit overdone, but that it was totally fine. Matt checked the inside himself and said it was definitely now overdone for medium-rare and offered to make another. We declined, as this one was still bound to be tasty anyways. Matt insisted on compensating us with dessert, since the order had been wrong twice. We told him that wasn't necessary. However, when our bill came, he had actually removed BOTH of our desserts, something we never would have expected!! What he couldn't possibly know, is that eating at this restaurant is a financial stretch for us. I had been saving change out of my coin jar for months just to do this, and with drinks and dessert the total came to $2.00 under what I had to spend, and that was without leaving a tip. When he removed the desserts, it brought the total down enough that I was able to leave our amazing server, Casey, a much larger tip than I normally give, because I was also once a new mom serving tables. She was also just that good, and she deserved it. My total was now less than $2.00 over my budget - something I could totally live with! It made me so happy to be able to tip a great server like that. Matt and Casey are great assets to your place of business. The next time we are looking for a great place to eat, you can be sure we will be looking back there again, but only if I can be seated in her section!",

The service cancels out the good food in rating the dining experience.  It should be noted, that it is not the servers who have customer service issues, but the management! 2A. They are constantly surprised when they have a crowd. It seems to catch them extremely offguard and their response is to become snide and neglectful of their customers. 2B. They also will not seat you - no matter no matter how many open tables there are - until the kitchen has caught up with the orders. I thought that was very selfish of them. My conclusion: just order to-go. LOL!",

    "text": "One certainty about this wildly popular lodge-like restaurant is that, unless you get there early, you will wait. Another is that it will be full. While most every other restaurant has been turned over at least once, including its current neighbor Cantina 1511, Firebirds is one of the area's few constants. It is such because it has constantly delivered excellent food along with attentive service. It's that simple.   It's also hard to ignore as the aroma of its wood-fired grill seems to permeate the air of the entire Stonecrest Shopping Center parking lot. Once seated in its beautiful log cabin themed dining area, order anything, you can't go wrong; however, their specialty, of course, is anything grilled so that is the route I'm always gonna take here.   I have ordered the American Kobe Meatloaf and enjoyed it.  At $19 though,  that's some expensive meatloaf. The wood-fired salmon is  also superb but a bit pricey at around $25. They offer a steakhouse-like lineup of beef cuts that mostly run from $25 to $35. You also can't go wrong with salads.  As you might be able to infer, this place is pricey because it can be. Considering that, they're just too many other restaurant options for me to be a regular here. If I'm going to spend a hundred bucks for meal I'd rather do so in a fine dining restaurant. Still, it's always a treat to go here and I recommend it.",

We placed our orders (2 beers, 2 salads and a kids meal) and were offered bread, we said that would be great.  It took almost 10 minutes to get our beers and 20 minutes to get bread at the table.  Our meals didn't arrive until after 8:35.  Meanwhile at the next table, a party of 5 that was seated after us had drinks and bread before our server even took our order.  Our server was observed to talk for long periods of time with another table.  When he finally came to check on us a little after 8:30, we asked where are food was.  He went to check and claimed it had just came out.  It was past 9pm (with a tired kid) before we were able to get out check and pay.  The saving grace of the night was that the food tasted good.  This is not the service we are used to from Firebirds..... And unfortunately I'm not sure we will choose to go back.",

When my condiments were questioned, I requested ketchup and yellow mustard which were brought out in small receptacles. My burger then arrived without lettuce and tomato, which I though was odd, but apparently that's just how they designed that burger. I flagged down the server and requested those add-ons, and politely obliged.  We both enjoyed our meals. I also enjoyed the strawberry basil lemonade.  I would return.",

    "text": "I can't believe I have not given one of my favorite restaurants a review!    Firebirds provides a great balance of quality, options, class, and price.  It's not a high end steakhouse, but provides a more relaxed approach to a similar meal.  Their prices are also closer to that of an Outback, though they cost more, the food can't even be compared to the standard chains.  The service at Firebirds will be great - they have the place overstaffed with very friendly and competent servers that will stop by just frequently enough to ensure you have what you need.     For an appetizer, get the lobster queso.  It has chunks of claw meat in it, definitely worth grabbing to go with the warm bread that comes out.    Their steaks are good, the wood provides a nice flavor and they get the temperature good, you won't go wrong here.  Their fish has always been tasty, flaky and well prepared.  I have not had a piece that had a fishy taste to it yet.  Sides are standard - baked potatoes, tasty salads, fries, etc.  One thing unique is Fried Spinach - it's definitely worth a try as it's crisp and melts in your mouth, but not very filling, so I'd order it as a la carte for the table to sample.    One of my favorite things to do is to stop by for lunch and get a burger.  For the price you'd pay at Hickory Tavern/Chilis/etc. you get a large juicy burger that barely fits in your mouth with a side, AND you get good service!  Wish they had slightly better beer prices, though they do have half priced bottles of wines one day a week - how about half priced pints?",

    "text": "Went back to Firebirds for the fourth time this year and I'm beyond pleased with the food, service, attention and commitment to quality customer service. My first visit was a disappointment but they have been consistent in every area ever since then.   Earlier this year I went on a date and everything was over salted and overcooked. A manager did respond to my review - which I greatly respected and appreciated - but I try to stay under the radar for integrity of my reviews so didn't accept a personal invite to come back and give them another chance.   Very happy to say that I gave them a second chance actually three chances, since that visit. They were that good :)  Got to give them kudos and five stars just for the commitment to quality and focus on customer satisfaction. My absolute favorite still remains the carrot cake and we continue to go just for the desert at least once a month. Yes folks the carrot cake is THAT good!  I absolutely love their sesame encrusted salmon had it twice before and it was cooked perfectly, very large portion. This particular visit my salmon was undercooked and a friends burger was over cooked.  We Haidet to complain but is she sad she knows how good the burgers are because the meet is Hannah ground on site and cooked to your temperature. She ordered it medium rare and it came out well done. Otherwise she said she wouldn't of said anything but she comes jobs for the burgers as I come just for the salmon.  So why do I still give them five stars you ask? Because the flavor, portions and the sides were absolutely wonderful. Love love love their wings. When we very politely asked if we could have our meals - in my case salmon cooked a little more and her burger replaced -  they didn't even blink an eye folks.   Not only that but yet again the manager came out and quickly rectified the issue and even comped the meal - which we did NOT expect nor did we ask for.  Got to give this location five stars for service - our waiter was only 18 years old but he knew the menu, he knew how certain dishes were cooked and he (after the hiccup with the dishes) stressed how committed to quality they were. Truly was a pleasant surprise and shows how well they hire and train!!  Five stars for customer service and commitment to quality, in addition to having a great menu - I would say 90% of the time by my own calculation based on five visits in ten months - The food was without issue. Love this location not sure if they're all the same but the staff and management here is consistent they stand top of what comes out of the kitchen and they guarantee the quality of your meal.   Will always give them the benefit of the doubt going forward based on the integrity exhibited the two times we had a hiccup. We feel comfortable politely and quietly voicing a request if something is over or under done to an extreme (if it's Med rare versus Rare we wouldn't have bothered saying anything).",

Steaks were prepared perfectly our salads (blt salad with dressing on the side) and the burger were all great! The lobster queso super yummy but it only had one little piece of lobster in it :( and the deviled eggs!!! Sooooo good !!! Oh and the bread ... crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside. The chocolate cake was ok I've had better but wasn't bad just not anything to rave about! It would have been a perfect dinner if we had better service so that kinda sucked but atleast the food was on point!",

Three things I absolutely love here are the salmon, mashed potatoes, and the creme brulee cheesecake! It doesn't get any better than this. Last night we came to celebrate our parents 29th anniversary. Our server was so kind and attentive. My husband really loves the chicken pasta. My parents rave about the Colorado salad. I have never had a bad time at Firebirds. The ambiance makes it a nice romantic setting for date night or a great place to come together with family. My family also could not get enough of the pineapple martinis that uses pineapple infused with vodka for 21 days. It's divine. While I think the South Park location is my favorite, this did not disappoint!",

    "text": "I hate giving a bad review. I do. I research. place before we go. And usually not disappointed. I'm giving 2 stars because the service was 5 stars. Which will tell you how disappointed I was in the food.  the bread came out and I was curious if it was some kind of flat bread. Cut into it and the crumb (inside the loaf) was gummy. I bake break at home--either their yeast had gone or they didn't let it proof long enough. I was starting out unimpressed. My husband wasn't super hungry and just got the tortilla soup. He said it was good.  Then my chicken came out. I ordered the pineapple chicken. As soon as I saw it I was concerned. The breast was ridiculously thin in some parts. It also looked dry. Since it came off a wildfire grill I decided to give it a chance.  I ate one bite and I was done. The flavor was great. The chicken was way too dry. I have only ever sent food back 3 times in my life. And this was one of them.  The worst part is that it was the manager who had brought me that plate of chicken.  I wouldn't have ever let that leave my kitchen as a home cook. You could tell by looking it shouldn't have left the kitchen. They did not charge me for the bowl of soup I had as a replacement. And since the bread is complimentary I never even addresses that. But If I am going to leave an honest review I have to put it all out there. I also got the tortilla soup. the flavor was solid. The chicken was again dry. I just ate around it.  I won't be going back. Good service isn't enough to take me back in the door.",

The drink specials you can get all day, and throughout the restaurant, but the bar bites are only available from 4-6:30 in the bar. Because food can be pricey, I was glad we found a table in the bar area to squeeze in to.   We ended up ordering chicken tacos, loaded tater tots, pigs in a blanket, and pretzels and beer cheese.   There is a spicy sour cream on the tacos so beware. The tater tots were by far my favorite food, so if you have to pick one go with these. They were hot and crunchy and loaded with toppings including green chili. The pigs in a blanket were ok. Definitely made in-house but kind of lacking for me. The pretzels and beer cheese were good, but a little bland.   The drink specials include all of the martinis and mixed drinks on the bar menu. A lot to choose from and I definitely made sure I got my moneys worth. My favorite was the blood orange drink. I can't remember exactly what was in it, but it wasn't too sweet and it had blood orange liqueur which was awesome and different.   I think we will definitely be back!",

Update: We tried the Southpark location twice as it's closer to us but were very disappointed. We came back to this location  again and the steak was outstanding! This is now our benchmark for steaks in Charlotte. Morton's, Fitzgeralds, and BLT are pricey but the closest flavor wise in our opinion is BLT.

    "text": "Had our 49th anniversary lunch today at Firebirds (Stonecrest) and ordered a filet mignon, medium/rare, and it came to the table almost mooing. My husbands salmon was perfectly cooked. I asked to have my steak done the way I ordered it and the kitchen put it back on the fire. My husband likes his food hot so he proceeded to eat his meal. I sat there while my steak was re-fired. The manager, Zeke, came by and apologized for the inconvenience and offered us a free dessert for the end of our meal which was appreciated. It was several more minutes before the manager came back to our table with my steak. He asked me to check to make sure it was cooked to my desire and when I cut into the steak it was still raw inside. The manager apologized again and took the steak back to the kitchen. By this time my husband had eaten most of his meal while I was sitting there with nothing to eat but bread. The manager came to our table again and said my meal will be \"on the house\" and it will be ready soon. When I finally received my steak it was dried out from re-firing on the grill twice while cut opened. The manager came back again to the table and I explained that a good steak should never be re-fired after it has been cut opened because all the juices will be exposed to the flame and dry out. He offered to remake the steak and/or send one home with us but I declined and said I was fine. We go there quite frequently and have had several times where the steak was not prepared to medium/rare and was sent back but this time is was beyond redeeming the quality of a good steak. Yes, I will return and am still a fan of Firebirds. If it wasn't for the manager making things right by deleting the cost of my meal and the free dessert I probably wouldn't be returning there again. Firebirds did the right thing and took responsibility for the mistakes in our meal today. BTW, our waitstaff was Austin and he was extremely helpful and apologetic for the mistakes that were occurring during our visit. Hopefully next time it will be a 5 star meal..!!",

    "text": "You know, the only reason why this isn't getting 1 star is because the service was friendly. Not fast--but friendly. My husband and I had visited before. But not in a while, and probably never for lunch.   We walked in and the hostess was talking to another customer on the phone, and didn't even acknowledge us with a nod or a hand covering the phone and a whispered \"I'll be right with you.\" Fine--sure. No one else was around and it was lunch time. No big. But telling for things to come.  Everything was clean, and we placed our order after not too long of a wait. Things went downhill from there.  The salad was positively COATED in dressing. They brought me out a cup of ketchup, then, inexplicably, someone came out to the table, grabbed it without saying anything, but left it there (?). They never brought us the bread they asked us if we wanted (and we responded in the positive). To their credit, they did ask us if they ever brought us bread out, and asked us if we wanted any (but this was after they brought us our meal out), which we declined since our food was already there. Then the food itself--granted, the price was low (11ish for burgers). There was a small (tiny) pile of fries on each plate with our burgers (I'm guessing sweet potato waffle fries are more expensive than steak fries because my husband had maybe 5 on his plate). The burgers themselves were literally dripping with grease. I took mine off the bun at one point--and the bun was completely brown for soaking up all the grease it could possibly stand. When I went to hand my plate to the server at the end of the meal, the bottom of the plate was also coated in grease.   Not sure if it's because it's a holiday weekend and the usual crew are out at the beach or something, and not sure if because it was lunch, they put their \"C\" team on, but it's very unlikely we'll be darkening their doorstep again.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here for lunch on a Saturday. Our goal was to have some good food and conversation. The restaurant was so over the top loud that we could barely hear each other speak. We almost left after we were seated because of the noise. From the outside and other reviews we had expect a nice-ish adult type restaurant. The place was filled with children including several that were running around the table next to us. I am a mom and I have no problem with family restaurants, but that was not what we were expecting or wanted for the afternoon. We stayed because we were starving and heard the food was good.  My husband ordered the mahi special which he greatly enjoyed. I ordered the French Dip. The first half of the sandwich was OK, not great, but not bad. The fries were delicious. The cider slaw was not for me but was not bad. The second half of my sandwich was not edible. The meat was too chewy and full of gristle. All of the meat on the sandwich was well done which would not have been my preference if offered a choice.   The service, however, was excellent. Our waitress was attentive and the manager took my sandwich off the bill.  I doubt my husband and I will return mainly because of the noise level and lack of ambience.",

    "text": "One way to asses the quality of a restaurant is if it stands up to what I call the Advertisement Test. ... Allow me to explain: if the food shows up and looks like what you would see in a magazine advertisement or television commercial, then you know you have a winner. Firebirds is a champion. Look at my picture and judge for yourself. The picture almost appears to be staged. The steak looks so juicy and perfect. The baked potato looks so deliciously prepped, you'd think I staged it. But no - this is real. It's how it showed up at the bar for me. I mean, I took the picture with an iPhone. Imagine if I was a professional photographer. A stranger next to me asked, \"Does that taste as good as it looks?\" Hence, the Advertisement Test.   Yeah, it was delicious. So good. As good as it looks. I've been here twice, and both times were a 5-star experience. I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "We typically love this place and usually receive great service. However!!! Omg! The server from the other night was a True nightmare that evening. I'm unsure if she was new or what the situation was but the sounds of her dripping a tray of drinks should have been an indicator of the level of service we were going to receive. So... I ordered the soup and the server gave me the saucer and bowl without warning that they were burning hot. As a result, I scorched my index and thumb fingers. When I shared with her, she didn't show any empathy. She said, \"oh, I'm sorry- I guess I'm use to how how it is. Would you like more bread?\" I was appalled! You burn me- halfway apologize and then offer me bread? Shaking my head. I was overly done with her at that point. When it was time for our entree, I asked for the firebird pasta without chicken and mild since I can't eat super spicy food.   Well, I received my food- of course it was super spicy. I asked the server if she ordered it mild as I asked and she said, \"yes, I told them, I don't know what else to tell you, they can put more sauce on it.\"  Are you kidding me? No! I should be offered a new one immediately. When I told her no, I don't want anything, then she asked if I wanted a new one. At that point, I had enough. I didn't want to deal with her anymore due to her poor service skills and uncaring attitude.   Again, this was my first poor experience at this location, but I assure you, if and when we go back- I will dodge her at all costs!   Note to Management staff: This woman was either having a bad day or she is a subpar hire- either way, she has tarnished your reputation.",

I would say it was pretty packed in general. When I left around 7:30 they had a wait it looked liked.   I got the ranch onion rings for an appetizer. My main dish I chose the spicy asiago pasta and my partner got the steak and shrimp seafood special they were currently having and parmesan mashed potatoes.   I will say menu wise they have something for everyone and a good mix of price ranges you can spend $13 on a burger or $30 on a steak.   The onion rings were battered nicely and the ranch dipping sauce was cool. My pasta had a nice flavor and a small amount of heat. I also tasted my partners steak and wow did it melt in your mouth. In that moment I was upset I didn't get a steak and would hands down get that if I went back.   Overall, the atmosphere was nice and I enjoyed the food. The customer service was on point and I would recommend.",

The raspberry chipotle dressing was lip smacking good.  Our server was attentive and kept the tea refills coming, which I always appreciate.  The weather was just perfect for their outside patio. Prior to today, I may not have realized that they offered outside dining. So, I am a new fan of Firebirds. It's not a hole in the wall, but it is sure operating at the top of its game and I respect that!     Yippee!",

Best point of the night.... wife orders a filet... comes out looking like two hockey pucks and tastes like dog food. We ask... you guys sure this is filet? Manager comes by and says.... we butterfly the filet so it cooks.quicker... could take 30 minutes for a filet.. confusing.  Poor servers are obviously understaffed and managed by someone that thinks hockey puck filets are ok.  Finished it off with a Luke warm cup of coffee... I digress.  Go to chick fil a around the corner you will leave with a smile and a bill 80 bucks cheaper.",

It was tender enough. You go for it if you are a steak lover. Grilled chicken salad is a healthy option. The spicy chicken pasta was the best one for me. Their spicy creamy sauce is awesome! Also the portion of the pasta was big so I couldn't finish. Oh, I liked their bread that comes before meals! If your server forgot to bring it, ask it. We ordered kids meal and that was great.",

Firebirds is definitely one of our 'special occasion' restaurants, and we've eaten here several times over the years... it's very close to home which makes it extremely convenient, but these days the Ballantyne/Piper Glen area is getting so congested, that I'd highly recommend reservations before you go!  Last night I met with my family for a birthday dinner... My younger brother had just played a very rough soccer game, and was getting hangry... our wonderful waitress brought us plenty of bread and butter and got him a caesar salad double quick while the rest of us were still deciding on drinks.  I'm so grateful that she was so sweet and thoughtful!  To be 100% up front, I've never had a bad drink here, never a bad steak, never a dry or over cooked salmon or vegetable, never a bad experience ever.  If you need an excessively creative menu, this is not the place for you.  It is a very nice steakhouse.  The fare is made up of high quality foods that are well prepared.  I love it!  I'll keep coming back as long as their doors are open!",

The pineapple chicken is also good. The blt salad is a family favorite. I really don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. Also, the service is always great!",

I was disappointed now our server was great but bar bites I wont do again.  We ordered the beef sliders, crispy cauliflower, philly steak egg rolls, fired up shrimp an chile dusted beef tenderloin medallions.  The beef sliders were good 3 of them for 5. The steak egg rolls were good an big but the sweet an sour sauce was to spicy for me. The same sweet an sour sauce is used for the crispy cauliflower.  The cauliflower is lightly battered great but to me that sweet an sour sauce ruined it. The fired up shrimp lightly battered but again that sauce was to hot. The tenderloin medallions if you cant prepare meat correctly take it off the menu. First when it says dusted chile on the medallions they really mean rolled, dipped an rolled in it 5 more times lol It was so spicy it ruined the meat an my friend loves spicy even for her it was to hot. The meat was over cooked as well we told our waiter he sent it back for us.Funny thing 2 managers came up to us an looked like they were scared to speak to us lol They remade the entree cooked perfect but that chile powder on top to much. Don't ruin a great cut of meat with sauces or seasoning ughh It would be great with just some butter an seasoning poured over it after its cooked. Our bills were all over 20 I realized I should have ordered my chicken sandwich.  Plus there are no drink specials except for Wednesdays.  Great place but better for just lunch or  dinner.",

Apologies for comparing it to Outback, it's definitely more upscale and with mostly higher quality ingredients.  Spinach lobster queso dip is just one of those things you can't mess up. I've had few places botch this one up, definitely something I would get again if I'm looking to fatten up a bit. The wings were ordinary.  The shrimp skewer (add $5) and lobster tail were tough; eating them is like gnawing on rock salt. Totally not worth the extra money, but it's all good because it was sponsored by my company (YEAUHHH BOIII). 0 stars for this one.  The creme brulee cheesecake was like crack - a huge portion of awesomely rich and creamy  cheesecake, topped with a thin layer of crystallized sugar. Could not stop gorging myself on this. If you like Key Lime Pie, you would love the one here, creamy and tangy, also served in generous portions. The brownie a la mode was decent, just stay away from the chocolate cake (dry and just bleh!).  Overall, great service, (mostly) great food... don't forget to try their pineapple cocktail! Points deducted for the horrendous wait for a table and that they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 8.",

The shrimp and strawberry salad is really good but it was over top mostly iceberg lettuce with a few pieces of spinach randomly thrown in.  I really don't care for ice burg lettuce and it definitely wasn't what I was expecting because on the menu said over top of mixed greens.   The Bbq chicken had excellent flavor but something was wrong with how it was cooked or it was old.  The skin was very tough on most pieces, to tough to chew and on some of the pieces the meat was dried out like it was freezer burnt or something.  I gave 4 stars because most of the time the food is on point.  Be careful with their carry out though.  Not as much care goes into it as when you dine in. BUT management is awesome and always fixes complaints plus gives you next meal on them for your inconvenience.",

The server and manager both corrected the problem and my second attempt was very tasty. We sat at a bar table n the ambiance  was still intimate.  Fried spinach tastes like crispy grease - really gross. I recommend subbing (try the green beans) I'd definitely go back but schedule reservations ahead.",

    "text": "Shame on me!! I've been to this restaurant a few times and I forgot to review it. I have to give a shout out to our server Victoria she,  was a doll!! First of all the ambience is really nice and cozy and pretty. Get your ass early there because you will have a wait or you won't even get in. The bar gets packed and the drinks are flowing and they are delicious and make sure you get the double diamond martini that comes from the giant pineapple that sits on the bar. Ok, they bring out some bread and butter on your table and it's homemade and it's delicious and soft and crusty but way too small for my fat ass bread appetite. You have to order the prime rib. This prime rib is succulent, meaty, a little fatty in the right spots and it comes with an au jus and horseradish cream that is to die for! You get a choice of garlic mash or a baked potato or roasted vegetables,  but choose the garlic mash. I just started a low-carb a hydrate diet so I had to spinach salad with the bacon and the little tiny bits of tomato in it and I think it's some type of a balsamic vinaigrette. I I added on some salmon to mine and it was scrumptious. The piece of salmon is a little bit on the small side that they give you however the salad is so big I didn't even end up finishing the salad or most of the salmon, which by the way they ask you how you want it cooked. The salads are a big deal here my friend had the fired shrimp salad and hers was delicious and my other friend had the fire grilled chicken salad which was delicious as well. The apps are always good. Nobody can make a crabcake like BRAVO for some reason but theirs here aren't bad at all. Overall it's a great place to have a cozy dinner or romantic meal,the service is great, the servers are friendly and informative and the place is just so pretty.",

LAST TIME WE WENT THEY DID OFFER \"CALL AHEAD\" SEATING, which saved a LOT of time.    Food is standard fare mid-range \"steakhouse\" with loaded baked potato, house-made yeasty bread loaf with crazy-big Australian Steakhouse style knives.  Good selection of steak rubs.  The coconut shrimp app makes for a satisfying dinner.  Ribs nice too.      Bar area is almost always jammed.  Wine selection is ok; could be better could be worse.  The price mark-up for champagne obscene, but they carry veuve-clicquot. . .so what can you say?  Lots of martini drinkers.    Managerial staff goes out of their way to be friendly.  Friday and Saturday nights are exceptionally busy; but, it's a fun people watching location, with a lively clientele where everyone seems to be having a good time talking, laughing and catching up with one another.",

I have now been here a couple of times and have tried the Pecean Encrusted Trout and the Sesame Encrusted Salmon.  Both are fabulous. If you are a fan of starchy sides, definitely try their parmesan mashed potatoes - yummy comfort food!    Dinner entrees range between $16 - 28... so if you are planning to have an adult beverage (or 2), appetizers, and an entree, you can easily drop $40 - $50 a person (before the tip).    However, if you are on a budget, this is also a great spot for lunch or to meet friends for appetizers and beverages.   They have a nice little patio too when weather permits.",

    "text": "I started coming to Firebirds around 1999 - 2000, you know, back when I had hair.  Firebirds was the best place IMO to eat in Ballantyne back then.  Well, here we are 13 years later and I am about 40 lbs heavier, and my hair has fallen by the wayside and Firebirds still is a righteous choice for dinner. I still remember the 1.5 - 2 hour wait so it was about 5:15 Friday night and we waltzed in and were seated promptly, I like that.  We were greeted by Debbie our server who was very attentive and took great care of us.  Appetizer of the Lobster Spinach Queso AKA \"App of the Gods\" which was chock full of lobster and cheesy goodness, it's a bit steep at $11.95 or so but well worth it. As a purist, I ordered the NY Strip, loaded baked potato and Firebirds BLT Salad.  Being a customer 10 years ago, I remember certain things...the BLT Salad is one of them.  It's not the same as it used to be.  It was still good, but it was MUCH smaller than years ago and the $4.95 add on charge is way to high for less than $1.00 worth of salad. The NY Strip was also tasty and the inside was cooked perfectly.  The grill was a tad bit hot and the outside of the steak was a bit charred for my taste but overall it was a solid steak that I enjoyed.  I enjoyed the potato also and it rounded out the meal well. One of the highlights of this place, which hasn't changed is the freakin' awesome bread that is served with the meal.  it is an individual loaf of hot, doughy perfection and to cut out a middle slice and smear the salted butter that accompanies it is something I imagine I will be doing in heaven, if I ever make it there. In summation, I must say I enjoyed my experience last night.  I realize some places change and restaurants must adjust to stay competitive, but Firebirds still offers a great meal",

The food was awful.   We had the Lobster Spinach Queso, which tasted like it was nothing more than melted Velveeta, completely absent of any additional flavor. For my entree I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Fillet (medium-rare) and the Southwest Au Gratin Potatoes. The potatoes tasted just like the queso with the only difference being the excessive pepper they mixed in for flavor.   As for my steak, I knew I was in trouble when I asked for Bearnaise Sauce and the waiter responded they don't have that on a regular basis (although to his credit he did ask if they would make it special). When the steak actually came the piece of bacon that was wrapped around it was actually 100% fat (yes I know bacon isn't the leanest cut of meat- but they could have used better) and the medium-rare was actually closer to blue-rare (110 degrees F not the 145 degrees it was suppose to be).   To summarize, I am sure it is a great place to grab a drink at the bar, but as for the food- there is a Wendy's right across the street.",

The lodge setting gives this place a feel unlike any other Charlotte restaurant I've been to as it's an open area with wood decor throughout. It's a stand along restaurant in a shopping center & a really nice treat if you don't mind spending the money.  I went here for lunch with work one day & I would definitely recommend this as a dinner/date night place if I were the one paying. But the food is worth the price you pay. Their menu selection is full of red meat, but also has enough other options for everyone. Portion sizes are huge, so bring your appetite along with your wallet.  The portions are huge, the food is great, the atmosphere is intriguing, & the check is big. I recommend Firebirds as a date night place where you don't mind getting your fingers & face a little dirty from their huge portions.",

    "text": "My family and I had a great dining experience on Friday night from the moment we walked in until the time we left. Moments after we were seated, our server Hailey came to the table and took our drink order. We skipped appetizers and opted for salads instead. The BLT salad was delicious. It was fresh, crisp and flavorful just like a wedge salad. I ordered surf and turf and it was cooked to perfection. It came with a bacon wrapped filet, 1/2 pound lobster tail, and loaded baked potato. I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor. My wife had the 12 oz prime rib, which came with au jus and horseradish sauce. She thought it was very tasty and had a baked potato with side toppings. My kids had the coconut shrimp and baby back ribs and were more than satisfied. The desserts were fabulous as well - creme brulee cheesecake, flourless chocolate cake, Big Daddy chocolate cake, and Key Lime pie. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for the menu choices. I would also like to mention that their service was par to none. We haven't experienced this level of excellence in food service since we moved to Charlotte 10 months ago. The manager, Ian, came by to chat and we told him how pleased we were. We can't wait until our next visit!",

They're smoked so they have the smoky taste you usually get at a BBQ place but they also have the buffalo wing flavor you want in wings.   I'm not always a huge fan of wings but really enjoyed these and would be back here for some wings and also check out a meal.",

If you ask for any suggestions or what new menu items are like, they're always right on.    One of my favorite items to order is the Lobster Queso for starters!  It's yummy...nuff said.  I also always get the BLT salad with my meals, it's one of the best!  Bread is always fresh and yummy!!  I usually order the Prime Rib dinner and it's always cooked to perfection!  I have also tried their burgers and many of their sandwiches and they are always good too!  The most favorite thing I love about Firebirds now is that you could make reservations online!!  I always avoided Firebirds on weekend nights because I knew there would be at least a 90 minute wait (if not longer) before we were seated!  Now that's fixed and it's always my first pick when asked \"Where should we go?\"!",

The food and drinks are consistently good and I have yet to find something I didn't absolutely LOVE!  Tonight, my friends and I went out for dinner and drinks and we had a wonderful time!  I tried the Passion Punch and it was AMAZING...It's definitely a sweet and sour blend of SKYY Infusions ,All Natural Passion Fruit Vodka, St. Germain  liqueur, fresh squeezed lime and fresh strawberry pieces. Would I like another?! Yes please! You will not regret it! It's very refreshing and delicious!  For Starters we tried the Lobster Spinach Queso-A spicy blend of lobster, baby spinach, tomatoes and pepper jack cheese with tri-colored tortilla chips. YUM!!! Nice large pieces of lobster mixed with spinach and the pepper jack cheese make this a great starter! It's wonderful!   For my meal, I had the sesame encrusted salmon which comes with ginger mustard aioli, Parmesan mashed potatoes, fried spinach. OK....where do I begin??? The aioli is too delicious for words....its so full of flavor and with the sesame crust on the salmon it offers such a great compliment to the fish. The Parmesan mashed are delicious as well, but that fried spinach is so unique! It literally melts in your mouth. Our waitress called them spinach chips....and that is so True!   All in all, this has become one of my new favorite places and I look forward to coming back again....VERY soon!",

I liked how the chicken was flavorful and almost shaved. The green onions added a great touch. Boyfriend got the steak and he wasn't very fond of it. He got a really fatty piece and asked for medium rare and it was still really tough to cut. He wasn't impressed with his steak. But I will say, the chicken pasta was awesome!

I was seated quickly to a table right up front next to the entrance even with a reservation and told all seats are first come first served. A little odd with a reservation, but not a deal breaker. Service was quick, efficient and very lively by Laurin who I dubbed \"The Goddess of Hospitality\". She could work any establishment and enable you enjoy it and appreciate her attention. I ordered the kabob medium rare with added side of grilled Shrimp and Fat Tire Ale. Bread was presented with butter. The bread was crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy inside. Unfortunately it was too crisp outside and sawing a slice left chips scattered all over the table. It was good with butter but the outside crisp was a bit too much. Maybe some butter melted on the outside just after baking would have helped. The plate arrived within 20 minutes, was nicely prepared and looked like a magazine photo. The steak was tasty but a little chewy with  too much gristle. Fat I am good with, the incredible gristle is unacceptable. Filet should not be this gristle rich but the perfect medium rare made up for the extra chew. The vegetables were perfect! The mashed potatoes were good but could have had a splash of heavy cream to soften them up. The Shrimp were cooked about 1 minute 30 seconds too long and that was unfortunate. They tasted great, just way too chewy, a common theme. Shrimp and steak both were exercises in chew, but with great flavor. I never went thirsty as Laurin was expertly attentive. The title Goddess of Hospitality is not easily earned! Did I mention the place was jumpin! It takes a skilled, caring and intuitive person to be great when business is booming at a place like this. So a few beers, allot of chewing and a glass of water later and I am satiated. My jaw may be sore tomorrow but my belly is full and I am glad I visited. Management checked in on me and I reported all was well. Sometimes great service just makes it tough to complain even a little. Hospitality makes up for mistakes. Thank you Laurin for making the starry night meal much better, a great dining experience with her attention. Without her perfect customer service, this would have been a 3 star review. No biggie, it can be improved on very easily.",

We sat, and we waited for 5 minutes before our server came over. It wasn't a server but another service staff asking what we wanted for our drinks and your sever will be over shortly, which was good team work.        We ordered our meals and the server ask if we needed bread, not if we wanted bread. Any way we requested the bread, to discover it was the frozen butt bread, not made in house. So the bread was not good at all, and should not even been offered.      My children's food was not prepared correctly and we did not receive our requested condiments and we had to ask numerous times. Our meals took 30 minutes to come out, never saw a manager, speak to any tables at all to see how his guests were enjoying their meals.     Table Maintence was terrible with 3 different staff coming by, and not clearing unless I handed it them. This probably stems from lack of policy implementation.   So we will mostly likely not return,  with the poor service standards and sub par food.",

We had a group of 10 and when two people couldn't attend, the staff kindly rearranged our table to have the remaining 8 of us all fit more intimately together at one round table.   Menu has a good mix and variety of options from salads, meats, fish and appetizers. The side salad options are good portion- definitely try the side spinach salad if you like bacon, hard boiled egg and tomatoes.   The baked potato was done just right and lightly salted. The simply grilled Mahi Mahi was fresh and grilled to perfection - slight grill marks on the outside and tend meat on the inside.   Others in the group had filet, Prime rib (huge portion!!), sirloin and chicken. The crowd seemed pleased with their dishes.  The staff was amazing at constantly re-filling up your drink! I think I had 5 club sodas during my meal!   We sat inside, but the outside seating area looked private and cozy. There was also an enclosed porch area to dine that likely has heaters.",

I won't go into detail on the atmosphere it was a crowded Saturday night but it was clean and had a cottage in the woods type decor.   They have a good drink menu with speciality cocktails. My fiancee ordered the siesta sangria which she loved. The food received mixed reviews from the two of us. I ordered the surf and turf--filet and lobster--which I thought was prepared perfectly and had good flavor. The size of the lobster made up for the fact that the steak wasn't quite 7 oz. I would choose a different side next time the French fries were the worst part of the meal. The lady ordered the prime rib which was a little tough and bland. Overall it wasn't a bad evening and I'm sure we'll be back.",

My partner got a baked potato and a steak. The baked potato was the star of the evening. How can a baked potato shine? Well for one thing it has to do with the preparation, the cooking and all of that. They wash and roll the potatoes in salt it seems, and so when baked they get a crispy sheen to them. Interesting. The steak was prepared as ordered and was a nice cut of meat. My meatloaf was good, as was the mashed potatoes. The green beans were ... well, you know, just green beans. The pecans did nothing to add to the taste. But the thing is my plate was like covered with food. It was more than two people could have eaten ... I mean really. It was good too, if you like that sort of food ... I was feeling cold, and wanted something to stick in place for a while ... that was a success in that department. All in all a good outing.",

You HAVE to try the fried spinach, too. This place gets pretty crowded during peak hours. I personally don't think it's worth more than a 20-minute wait, but I'm impatient. One thing I have to say is that they are very customer service conscious. During our most recent visit, when the manager came to our table to ask how everything was, one person in our party mentioned that her steak was a little overcooked for what she had ordered. He took one look and offered a new one. When she refused, he had 2 desserts ordered for the table instead. Also, sign up for their emails and you get discount coupons in the mail and something special on your birthday.",

Of course like most popular restaurants there was a little wait. #WorthTheWait  They brought waters out for both of us while I started with a mixed drink called the Mango Mojito. Absolutely amazing. The alcohol was mixed so well that you couldn't even tell it was in it. Thought about getting two, but I was driving.  For my appetizer I tried the smoked Chicken wings and they were delicious but then again it is somewhat difficult to find a place with bad chicken wings. There were about 8 of them, perfect appetizer size and I myself prefer almost everything spicy, the wings had enough kick in them to satisfy my heat cravings.  And for my main entree I had the Pepper Crusted Sirloin, prepared medium well... absolutely amazing. They prepared my steak just the way I requested and the pepper seasoning made it an absolute delight to my taste buds. By far one of the BEST steaks I have ever eaten. A very highly recommended meal in my book.  The service was fast, and friendly. They had friendly smiles on their faces and answered our questions with knowledgeable responses and expertise. Overall I five this restaurant get a 5.0 out of 5.0. They will definitely be seeing me again.",

I was told our table was ready and we were taken to a large round table in the middle section.  The restaurant was so noisy we were unable to carry on a conversation with one another and the large round table made it impossible to talk to anyone seated across the table.  Very disappointing.  Other larger parties were seated at long rectangular tables that were not as wide making it easier to talk to one another. Unfortunately we were not given that option.

Immediately the chef appeared with an entire new dinner for the me and the steak was beautiful and cooked to perfection.  It became  a PERFECT evening when the desert came.

    "text": "Ate here once thanks to a recruiter, the interior is very swanky.  Even though it was during lunch time, the place was packed and dimly light inside, creating that atmosphere... though I don't think that's needed for that time of day.  Anyway, I ordered the Aspen Sirloin with seasoned steak fries (wasn't paying for it).  After an acceptable wait of 15 minutes, the order was on the table.  The steak was perfect: medium-rare that cut like butter with the knife.  The whole steak was consumed, as were the steak fries.  It was a fantastic steak.  Would go again if I can rope someone else into paying for it. ^_^",

    "text": "I have worked in restaurants for more years than I care to admit.  I have worked casual to upscale and everywhere in between.  I know good food and I know good service.  Firebirds never ceases to amaze me.  The steaks (particularly for the pricepoint) are expertly prepared and the sides are on point.  Wine and spirit selection will please any pallette.  As for the service, I am always impressed.  We've been a few times and most times have been greeted by a manager at some point during the meal to inquire as to our satisfaction. In other cases I found the servers to be engaging and friendly without being annoying.  I've been to both the Southpark and Stonecrest locations and the consistency is precise.  You really can't ask for much more from a restaurant!",

I had the 7 oz filet with the pepper crust two weeks ago and still can't get it out of my head- the pepper crust is perfect! I'm a fan for sure, but the pineapple martini I had was overpriced and not very good. I'll be back for the food for sure, but will stick with beer next time.",

    "text": "I've eaten here several times and have had negative and positive experiences.  The food has always been pretty good, albeit a bit expensive for what you get.  If you're into steaks and grilled fish you'll be happy- they cook them to order and fit the bill.  I've had been quality at the same price, but overall its acceptable.  Perhaps my favorite thing on the menu is the loaded backed potato.  They salt the skin and load it up with sour cream, cheese, chives, etc. It's pretty awesome.  The bar leaves a bit to be desired.  The cocktails are very syrup-y and generally fairly unauthentic.  Don't order a specialty drink like their version of the old-fashioned- its awful.  The wine list is a bit weird- there's some good stuff on the high end but the by-the-glass options are lower quality and overpriced.  The service side has been inconsistent.  I once showed up with my kids having called ahead for a table. They told me they'd have one waiting on my arrival, which was early evening on a weekend.  When I arrived they told me I'd have to join the wait queue, which was over an hour.  Not exactly what I wanted to do with 2 kids and grandparents from out of town.  So we left and had to get Chinese take-out as every other nice restaurant around this area was packed. On another visit I was seated fairly quickly and have a very personable waiter.  So I guess its a crap-shoot- you don't know how well you'll be treated.    Overall its a pretty expensive restaurant for its inconsistent service, but the food is acceptable and its a nice environment.  Its very crowded Thur/Fri/Sat, so go very early or plan on waiting.",

That said, if you're big on steak or grilled chicken/fish you'll probably be pretty happy with this place. I myself opted for a burger, which was cooked perfectly and delicious. Their side salads are great as well, and the soup is also recommended.  On the whole a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "I am normally not a fan of chain restaurants but Firebirds is definitely one I cannot stay away from too long.  When I first moved to Charlotte I worked at the Rae Road location for a few months.  I have pretty much sampled the whole menu and for the most part it is all top notch.  A few items I might stay away from would be the meatloaf (salty, nothing impressive) and the coconut shrimp.  I highly recommend the steaks, burgers (can get them medium-rare! Yum!), Salads, Salmon, and so on.  Of course anything is better when topped with Blue cheese and mushrooms.  I'm not sure why but they stopped serving the Blue cheese potato chips which is a huge bummer.  It was a great way to start the meal.  And if they don't bring the bread make sure you ask for it or you'll be sorry you didn't.  Very warm, tasty bread!  The service is great (should be because they only get like 2-3 tables per person) and the bar is fairly efficient for how busy it usually is.  Biggest recommendation is to call ahead.  It doesn't matter what night, they are typically on a wait and if you don't you will be waiting along time!    Enjoy!",

    "text": "I have lived and worked close to the Ballantyne area for at least five years and have yet to actually dine in Firebirds until tonight. (I have gotten to-go a few times.) I think it may be because their menu is pretty expensive and not so extensive and the restaurant seems a little uppity, however I had won a gift card in a contest so thought tonight would be a great night to try it out. Love the atmostphere, not uppity at all, on the high end of casual - I imagine it may be a little more formal on weekend evenings. We went in around 7:30 which was towards the end of their peak time as the tables were full but most were paying their checks - the hostess was nice, and the waitress was nice also. Then a big group came in and took a lot of our waitress' attention and therefore we did not receive the beer we had ordered and the bread she told us was coming until much later. TOTALLY not a big deal. We received our food - the AMERICAN KOBE BEEF MEATLOAF, SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS and PORTABELLA SANDWICH all of which were really good. As we were getting ready to pay our check, our original waitress returned (others had assisted us with bringing out the food, etc.) and we could tell she felt really bad thought there really was no need to. The manager (I'm assuming), came over and informed us that he would be taking the beer off the check and he was really sorry for the hiccups, even though the beer and bread were long gone in our minds. A+ for service! We most likely will be going back, but I feel their prices should be slightly lower.",

We had a great booth for just us girls and we  just kept ordering more wine...why not? we were celebrating! We all ordered the filet mignon cooked to medium rare. We kept on talking and drinking and never realized we were waiting more than an hour for our food to arrive. We only noticed when the manager came up to us to apologize for our long wait and he would grant us a free dessert. At first we were like \"really? for what\" and that's when we realized so much time had flown by. I give the severs props for being the first to admit their errors, without us asking for the manager directly. We really didnt care much though as we were having too much of a blast to even notice :)  I'll definitely be back to this place when i return to Charlotte!",

    "text": "I really liked this place. I couldn't even tell that it was a steakhouse or a chain. It felt more comfortable and much swankier than your regular Outback. The lights are low, the kitchen is open and the patrons tend to be a bit more on the sophisticated side. No screaming kids and no birthday group chant-and-claps.   We did wait - even though it was a Wednesday - but not for terribly long. They also have Happy Hour Wednesdays which means their delicious pineapple martinis are only $4. Well drinks and beer(?) are only $5. Snap!   We started out with the lobster queso which was quite tasty. They serve it with tortilla chips though the bread is also a tasty accompaniment. (This is random, but the bread they serve looks like a butt. Like a human butt. It's weird.) My friend and I both had the salads. They were fabulous. My server was more than wiling to put up with my custom order. (Add this, take this off.) Be careful, though - they automatically mix in the dressing instead of serving it on the side. It got a bit drippy towards the end and I couldn't take my leftovers home.   We also indulged ourselves with the Lemon Big Daddy cake. They have a chocolate version too, but since we're in the south we went with the lemon. It's a delicious, light cake served with fresh blueberries and whip cream. I'm pretty sure a choir of angels started singing the moment it hit my taste buds. I was all, Michael? Is that you? You want a bite?  Although Firebirds gave me food coma, I would say it's top notch as far as chains go. I must now find some fat pants to wear as I lay on the couch.",

    "text": "Just went to Firebirds for the first time.  Food was terrific - party sampled soup (smoked tomato bisque), french dip sandwich, baby back ribs, wood plank grilled salmon, cheeseburger and creme brulee cheesecake.  All were outstanding!  For the first time in recent  memory, all plates were empty at the end of the meal.  Thank you fellow Yelpers for mentioning both the bread and the burger.  One suggestion to the restaurant though - if you serve ribs, you should also serve up a warm wet towel or something else to aid cleanup at the end of the meal.  Even a little wet-nap would have been nice.  Decor was beautiful - rustic but high class cabin-y feel.  Noise level was a bit loud at lunch but the place was busy - no emply tables - through the entire lunch hour, until close to 2 pm.  Lighting in the ladies' room was a bit dark for lipstick application though.  There's a huge woodburning fireplace in the bar area and outdoor seating available.  Flyer on the table was promoting half price wines (both glasses and bottles) on Mondays.  Not sure if this is a seasonal promotion or permanent - but I'll try to get back there to indulge!  Comparably priced to places like 131 Main or Maggiano's or Red Rocks.",
