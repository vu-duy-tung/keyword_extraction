Not being familiar with mediterranean cuisine, a patron and server informed me of some of the dishes. I ordered hummus, meat pies, chicken/lamb swarma, baba ganush(?), and a salad. The salad had some sort of vinegarette dressing, cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes. Very crisp and fresh. The hummus was great as was the rest of the meal. Service was a little slow as there was only two servers for 14 tables and to go orders. Overall great place!",

I'm slightly apprehensive about writing a review so that others don't go there and make me wait for a table. But, the food is so freaking amazing and the people there are the nicest and super accommodating that the world needs to know and they deserve all the business. I've eaten Halal food many many times and in some of the top places in North America where there are large Middle Eastern populations (NYC and Toronto mainly). From everywhere between the street carts on the corner of 53rd st(those \"guys\") to fine dinning establishments drinking Arak cocktails. And, with out a doubt, Jasmine Grill has consistently been the best halal/ME food I've eaten to date. Tip: You must get the hummus and baba ganoush, both are some of the best I've had.",

For the main course I had the shrimp kebabs and my husband had the chicken, beef and lamb shawarma.  Both dishes were full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  Definitely get the house salad and yellow rice pilaf as sides. The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  This is now my new favorite restaurant and we will return frequently.",

Garlic sauce--it is sensational!  eat it in the pita w/some shawarma and a bit of tomato (from the salad) and ooh la la delicious!  My husband got the beef & chicken kabobs--he was surprised--actually surprised how deliciously tender they were. Again, chose the same sides w/no rice. and the price was very fair. We'll be back--!!    PS. Our first take-out order a few weeks ago was the lamb chops---LOVED THEM!",

I ordered the chicken/steak kabobs with rice and hummus. I also ordered a side of falafels. The meat was good, nicely flavored but not very tender. Both the chicken and steak were a bit tough but not to the point that it was bad per se. The falafels were really good which is why I'd prefer giving 3.5 stars but since that's not possible I'll round down. The hummus I didn't like... Not even a little bit and the pita bread was hard and not very fresh. The rice and veggies that came on the side were good but I would have liked more veggies!! All in all it was a decent dinner but probably not one I'd repeat.",

Only one suggestion which is to go a little lighter on the salt.   It felt like each dish was personally prepared by a chef who cares about their craft.   Lovely and courteous staff give this place a nice family feel.  Jasmine has the best baba ganoush in town (nicely smoked eggplant) and the saffron rice is addictive.",

But we were stopped halfway to the counter and told to go ahead and sit anywhere. My only complaint was the service was very slow as far as placing the order and getting our bill. The food came out quick once a server came by to take our order. I would come here again for their lunch special, but only do take-out. You really can't beat the $6.99 lunch special which consists of chicken kebabs, yellow rice (can sub for white rice), greek salad, and lentil soup. You can upgrade and get the kofta lunch special for only $7.99.",

We had to think of basically all new things to order, which was fine but we were told couldn't get the plates with rice and two sides- as it says on the website (please update if not True!). When the food started coming out, the sides for almost everyone were wrong by one degree or another. Most of us got the chicken kebab plate with sides and the hummus is great (very stale pita though)! Like I said, the food was good but the service was sub par and I would have liked to have been able to get what was printed on the menu on their website.",

They used sumac (not the poison kind dont worry) on it as well as my white rice. That was a real treat. The waitress and runners were excellent, trying hard but not bothersome. Every single thing was great. I'm blown away. Much nicer inside than it's strip mall location.",

It's cheap and affordable but the reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because the service here today was not great at all it took about 5 mins to ask for what we would drink and we was the only people in here. My water wasnt refilled until we was getting the check and getting boxes for the food. That's why they got 3 stars",

With a ton of togo orders and an almost full restaurant it was not enough to handle the crowd. The togo orders seemed to take priority. We didn't have drink refills for most of the meal and it took 20 minutes for the veggie platter to come out. They were out of the grape leaves so it was just hummus, baba ganoush and falafel.   However, I really enjoyed the food! The hummus was great, and I loved the lightly dressed fatoush salad. My boyfriend got lamb and beef schwarma and I got beef kabobs. Both were huge portions and the meat was well seasoned although not very warm. I loved the sauces that it came with. They have some great lunch specials too.   Heard from others after the fact that the service is always like that but the food is always great. Will go back again, maybe get takeout, or just expect to be there awhile!",

Well, I finally got to try it today for lunch, and I'm really happy I did. The food was great! My group split a hummus plate and some falafel, and both were excellent. I ordered a chicken kebob with yellow rice, and it was super flavorful and a very large portion. The house salad was a bit..odd I guess would be the right word with all the spices. It wasn't bad, just very different than expected. Also, the lemon garlic sauce that comes with each plate is fantastic! The service was a bit slow, especially for lunch time, but the food quality, portion size, and price all make up for that easily. I will definitely be back!",

The falafel is very light and it's the straight chickpea kind (not the green ones with parsley added).  I will also try a dessert next time.  We just ordered so much food I didn't have room!  It was comfortably busy on Sunday.  Service gets a little slow at times because there are only two waiters for the whole dining area.  But for the price and taste it's definitely worth it.",

They have a bit of an identity crisis, whether it's a True sit-down dining experience type restaurant. OR if it should be a great place to walk-in with gym clothes on, past all the seated diners, and take out pre-ordered food. Depending on the night, the place can get busy with both diners eating in and take out, the service can be slow and intermittent with only one person as the server and cashier. So we try to go on random week nights to avoid it.  Did I say the food was pretty good?! Because it is.",

The yellow rice is always one of my go to side items and is always perfectly seasoned and cooked. They have some amazing lunch combos during the week and the hummus is a must with every meal eaten here.

I have to admit, the lunch meal started with the intention of going to Crispy Bahn Mi across the street... but the small detail of the bread shipment not making it in that morning caused us to wander across the street and try Jasmine Grill out.  Totally a fan.  Their hummus was delicious (as well as beautifully plated).  I had the beef and lamb shwarma, which I inhaled.  Each entree had 2 sides included (even though I searched high and low on the menu to see how many sides you were allowed).  Baba ganoush and white rice where my sides of choice.  The menu is not too big... so you won't get overwhelmed and the staff are super friendly.  A couple of us had questions due to dietary restrictions, but our waiter answered everything in a friendly and calm manner.  It was Saturday so there were a lot of folks in the dining room, but the food still came out super quick (in my opinion).  Some of my friends tried their wrap options and fries.  Next time I make it out here... I will have to try their falaffel.  They totally lived up to their 4.5 star rating on Yelp.  :)",

We ordered the humus, the equivalent of dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), house salad, chicken kabob with white rice, braised lamb shank with yellow rice and kunafa for dessert.  All the dishes were on point... seasoned nicely and plentiful.  Chicken kabob grilled with a nice char but still very tender and the braised lamb shank was succulent. The yellow rice you can have by itself it was nicely seasoned.   This is not a fine dining establishment but if you want good and simply prepared Mediterranean/ Middle Eastern food... enjoy this place! Oh,  yes... the service,  the night we were dining in the place was 75% full and there was a constant flow of customers picking up the take out orders.  The two waitresses working that night did not miss a beat attending to their dine in customers and take out orders.  I asked for a mint tea to have with my kunafa and the waitress said they didn't have mint tea bags. Instead she came out with standard black tea bag in cup piping hot and fresh mint on the side to flavor my tea... very clever!  My colleague that dined with me the first time went back to this restaurant a few days later with his whole family and they all enjoyed their dinner.",

Here's the general protocol:  Once a table is seated, the guests must be greeted-acknowledged less than 3 minutes.   Serve Drinks-ladies always first Selling -suggestive sell isn't order taking  Bring bread, plates for appetizers or salad to share and not wait to be asked Clear dirty appetizer plates for guests before the entrees are brought to the table  Checked on the guests within 2 minutes after entrees are served  Refill beverages before guests ask, half empty and not half full, servers! Maintenance tables, ask if guests would like their food packed and clear table of everything except their drinks Suggest- homemade desserts  Bring check & thank your customers!

It's in a little strip mall next to a dominoes and a tax preparation establishment...  Two dudes were behind the counter, and both were subdued yet friendly.  Cool atmosphere, good crowd, yet quiet and low key.   I started with the Vegetable Delight, which is an appetizer made up of grape leaves, hummus, baba ganoush, and falafel.  It was excellent...  And a ton of food.  It was at about this point that I begun questioning my decision to order so much.  After a twinge of food guilt, I powered through and readied myself for what was coming next.    Main course was a shwarma platter, which was essentially beef, chicken, and lamb grilled and served over rice.  It too was most excellent.  The lamb was by far my favorite, once I got past the fact that I was eating baby sheep.  This momentary pang of animal life-robbing guilt quickly passed, and I crushed the entire pile.  I love animals.  Paired that up with Blackberry juice, which was nothing short of awesome.    In summary.  You should probably eat here.  I plan on returning this week...  And, I found $20 in the parking lot.  Win.",

LG placed a carryout order for us and we went to pick it up in about 15 minutes, but was disappointed that it took some time even when we got there.  Such a lag - I was chocolate-wasted and in need of some grub.  If you plan on carrying out or something, giving them ample time to prepare the food is your friend (and worst enemy... I want to eat NOW).  We ordered a bunch of dishes, and frankly, I don't remember all of them.  I just remember that the lamb was juicy and tasty.  The chicken was equally good.  They were dishes with rice and choice of protein... it wasn't terribly memorable, but served its purpose.    Owners are nice and attentive.  Despite me sprawled out across the chairs and looking demonstrably bored (bc of waiting for food), they offered me some water and acknowledged me saying that the food was almost ready.    So, while solid, not entirely inspiring.  If anyone can recommend a good quick spot to hit up for some Middle Eastern grub, hollatchaboi.  dmo out.",

They seem to know what the word vegan means, so that's good too. Super friendly, so we don't mind waiting a little bit for the food. Small joint, so get it to go and take it to one of the breweries.

I had the beef and lamb shawarma plate, it was only $11 and it was a huge plate of food. the meat was so tender and full of flavor, and they give you this amazing sweet garlic mash that pairs perfectly with any dish. sadly I didn't take a picture because I was too excited to eat! My partner got chicken kebab that was charred perfectly, seasoned beautifully and the chicken was so tender and delicious. I can't believe the fantastic customer service we received either. the waiter , Amine, was so sweet and happy to help us, answered all of the menu questions that we had. he was amazing and we can't wait to come back. I am so happy with this place!!!",

The best thing I can say about this place is that they really care about what they do. The ingredients are fresh, the dishes are well prepared, the waitress really wants you to enjoy your order and the manager makes sure everything is clean.

Everything was well seasoned and the portions were a nice size.   But, the icing on the cake for me was the delivery service. I'm staying at a nearby hotel and ordered through their third party, door dash. My food arrived in less than 45 minutes and was still piping hot.

Small little restaurant where you can order at the counter to go, or dine in and order at the table. The waiter was very friendly and welcoming. You can see the kitchen station from the tables.   I ordered the Chicken Kebab plate and it came with generous portions of chicken and rice.  You also get to pick a side - so naturally I went for the side salad which was good. Dinner is super affordable here too, coworker and I ordered the same meal and a piece of baklava to share and our bill came out to $25! If anything this place should charge a little more. Great value!   There are some TVs in the table area - so would be a good spot to come by if you are eating alone. Also, plenty of parking.",

My favorite place is Le Kebab Grill near the University area.  I will say the flavor of the chicken at Jasmine grill was better than Le Kebab.  The salad they served us was not crispy and fresh. It looked like they had it sitting in salad dressing for hours and it wilted.  The tables were not properly cleaned-- restroom area is pretty scary and gross. With boxes of restaurant supplies stored right near the restroom area. Not sure if that is a health violation but should be!   The main eating area just looks like a basic run down fast food place. Dark lot, dingy, no music and the waitstaff did not smile.  Back to the food,  it was good, chicken was excellent, everything else I had was bland.  Their garlic paste was nowhere near as good as le Kebab.  Even the texture was not right.   Just for comparison I ordered Baklava and it was ok. It was slightly burned/ overcooked. Presentation was boring.  I might go back if I happened to be in the area but Le Kebab will continue to be number one in my book.  They have great food, decor, music and the people are at least friendly. Never had a bad thing to say about Le Kebab.  Clearly this place is not hurting for business with the great reviews-- but I am scratching me head. Maybe all of you have not eaten elsewhere? Idk.",

It was very easy to find since we knew where to look, thanks to GoogleMaps.  We arrived just after opening at 11:00 on a Monday.  No lunch crowd yet, though people trickled in as we ate.  Service was prompt and friendly.  We received our drinks very quickly and were told of the daily specials.  We ordered falafel for an appetizer.  My wife ordered the special, chicken kabob which came with a salad and soup.  These three items came very quickly.  I ordered the chicken shawarma with yellow rice and hummus.  The hummus came with the appetizers.  Honestly, we could have stopped here.  The food was great and there was a ton of it.  The main meals came out shortly after I finished the falafel.  Oh my!  The rice was amazing.  My chicken shawarma was moist and very flavorful.  The two sauces which came with it went very well together and added great flavor.    The service remained great for the whole meal and we left so stuffed.  The restaurant smelled great, looked great, and created two very pleased customers today.  I could eat their falafel everyday.  The perfect texture inside and out.  A wonderful lunch for under $30 for two!  We cannot wait to go back!",

Yesterday, we were displeased with the customer service at \"JASMINE GRILL\". We were greeted with no issue from the Host. He went to validate our table with the manager or owner who had not looked at us at first. Once we were taken to our table, the manager or owner saw us and refused for us to be seated there. He stated there is a reservation for 50 people attending dinner. The restaurant was not even at a 1/4 capacity. We were told there would be a 15 to 20 minute wait to receive service. My family and I were appalled. We left for another restaurant. It is sad to be treated that way. My family is bi-racial. We have been a lot places in the world. It is sad  to feel un-welcomed in my home Country.",

I was in mood for something else, but when I looked the pictures of this restaurant, I had to check it out. I'm glad I did!   It was short drive from my hotel, and I arrived here around 7pm. There were a couple of groups were dining in.  The staff greeted me and told me to sit wherever I liked.  I sat down, and the staff brought me the menu. The menu was very simple, and all entrees came with a side or two sides.  There were some sides that I wasn't familiar with, but the staff was nice enough to explain to me. I ordered lamb kebab and sides of baba ganoush and fatuch.   The staff came back with my fatuch after five minutes. It was nicely presented and seasoned very well. Lots of diced cucumber and tomatoes which I really liked.  I waited 20 more minutes to get the rest of the food. My food looked delicious.  Baba ganoush was salty as the staff mentioned; however, I couldn't stop eating it. It was addicting!   My lamb was cooked medium and very tender. I've never had lamb this good before. It was cooked with grilled veggies.  Their homemade pita bread goes well with the meal. My meal was so good that I just kept eating.  After I finish my meal, I realized I was very stuffed.   The restaurant is very cozy. The staff is nice and friendly. The service is also good. The prices are generous, and the portions are good. Ample parking.  I'm glad I found this restaurant and will definitely be coming back whenever I'm in town.",

Previously they never had a take-out menu so I never thought about it when I wanted to eat out.  However, now they do and I'm there more often than I'd like to admit. The guys behind the counter work hard all the time putting out orders. And it pays off because you get quality food at a great price and time.  They have an excellent lunch special and it's definitely worth coming back for dinner. My favorite is the chicken Schwarma but my parents got an all veggie dish and have not stopped talking about it.",

The people who were working were all incredibly friendly, and our server was able to explain everything about the menu items, which is great for people who are unfamiliar with Middle-Eastern cuisine.   The food was DELICIOUS. Not one bite lacked flavor, and the chicken was incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned. For only $7 for hummus, pita, salad, rice, and chicken, I was BEYOND satisfied.

When I picked up some show banners today at American Signs, my friend Chris highly recommended it.    I choose their chicken kabob special, which came with a salad and soup.  I have to tell you that was one of the best seasoned salads I have ever had.  It's a simple olive oil and lemon based dressing, when you try it you'll know what I mean.    The chicken kabob was very tender and again the seasoning used makes it stand out.  Served on a bed of onions and green peppers with a supersized serving of rice.  I will definitely make this one of my new favorite places to eat on South Blvd.  Note:  It is a little tough to find.  When I drove into the parking area I noticed Toppers and Baby USA but glanced right by the Jasmine Grill sign.",

I ordered the chicken sharwama. So good. Yum.   Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because they added a 18% tip since it was 8 person group. I usually tip 20% or more. I used to be a server. I didn't know it was added so I tipped 23 dollars and I was charged 21 dollars already. That pissed me off when I realized this later in the evening. I was going to call about it but I let it go. Anyway the price was decent 117 minus the two tips added.   For 8 people it was good. My chicken sharwama was 6.99. Mango juice was fresh but it was tasteless. I guess I'm used to sweet juice. I'll def go back might even go back today but I'll  just have to keep a close eye on my receipt next time. Lesson learned.",

Unfortunately they lost a star on the front end. No one was there to greet us and we were worried we had somehow walked into a closed restaurant. We stood near a table for like 5 minutes in a completely empty restaurant debating leaving or sitting down. Eventually someone came out to seat us and sat us at a super sticky table. Not a huge deal I guess but first impression was not great.  What was great was everything that came after. I ordered the chicken kebob with hummus and fattoush as the sides. I was super excited that I was able to pick 2 sides instead of 1 side and rice. I am not huge on rice.  They brought the hummus out first with freshly made bread. Both were yummy and it was possibly the best hummus presentation I have ever seen. It was so lovely and I was pretty much full after eating it with the bread.   The chicken kebob was super tender and well seasoned. I shared some and ate the rest and left the restaurant completely stuffed (the fattoush came home with me so I could have an easy lunch today).   All this deliciousness? Only $8. You heard me right. $8 for a delicious somewhat healthy meal where we both left completely full. We will definitely return!",

I LOVE Mediterranean food, so menu options made it hard to choose.  I had the chicken kebab with yellow rice and fattoush. The meal was absolutely superb! The kebabs were cooked to perfection with a wonderful mix of Mediterranean spices. Yellow rice was delicately cooked with just the right hints of spice. The fattoush was perfect mix of herbs, spices, fresh veggies and a \"just right\" mix of crispy pita prices and oil.   Jasmine Grille will certainly become a place that I frequent and recommend to others.",

I love Mediterranean food and was hoping to write a five-star review after a sit down experience.   I finally got a chance taking my husband there for a sit down lunch on a weekend when we were in the area. I ordered the Veggie Delight, which includes falafel, hummus, baba ganoush and stuffed grape leaves, and he ordered the chicken kabob plate.   We both agreed the falafel was among the best we've had, the hummus very good but the baba ganoush lacking the smoky flavor I like. I had to ask for the yogurt sauce for my falafel since I wasn't given any but I didn't realize the stuffed grape leaves was missing from my plate until I got home. Dang.   The chicken kabob was pretty good though a little on the dry side.   I was not thrilled about the service we got when the place was not packed. We had to get our own silverware and napkin since the wait stuff didn't notice there was none on our table. Our ice tea didn't get refilled once until I asked for it at the very end. Did I mention I didn't get my stuffed grape leaves and had to ask for the yogurt sauce?",

It was quite busy at 12:30 today but they quickly wiped off a table and sat us down. The waitress gave us menus and told us about their amazing $6.99 lunch special....lentil soup with a salad and then either chicken shawarma or chicken kabobs with their yummy rice. (I added the yummy part). We both went for the lunch special, but I substituted fries for the salad since me and most vegetables don't get along. The meal did not disappoint! The lentil soup was flavorful. The chicken was probably the tastiest chicken I've ever eaten. The rice was delicious. My fries were alright, but I'm not judging a mediterranean restaurant on their fries. Overall the meal was amazing and I'm thrilled my new townhouse is less than 2 miles from there.  Oh, and the staff there is awesome. The waitress seemed to genuinely hope that I enjoyed my meal since it was my first time. They didn't rush us at all even though it was busy. I will definitely be going back there soon!",

I ordered up the special of the day which was the Chicken Kebabs.  We also ordered the Baba Ganoush as an appetizer.  While we waited for our meal, the waiter brought out a fresh Mediterranean salad and Lentil soup.  The lentil soup had a great consistency and awesome flavor.  The portion size was nice (about a cup).  The salad was very fresh with juicy tomatoes and cucumbers and lightly dressed.  The Baba Ganoush had a nice smoky flavor and was well seasoned with hints of garlic, lemon, and garnished with olive oil and parsley. It was served with fresh hot pita triangles in a cloth lined basket. The jasmine rice was some of the best I have ever had.  The portion was very large.  The chicken Kebabs took me by surprise.  With the impressive grill marks, I worried the chicken would be dry.  Boy was I wrong.  Very tender and flavorful.    My only regrets are not asking for a to go box for my leftover rice.  I was stuffed for less than $10.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.  Fast service, plenty of food to eat while you wait for your main course.  Good customer service.  Jasmine Grill can be a little cramped considering the size of the dining room and the amount of customers they seem to receive during lunch.  A few more visits like this would likely raise my scored to a 5.",

The chicken was marinated and grilled and also comes with a yummy garlic sauce. The restaurant is a bit small and cozy, you can easily order ahead and pick it up. Sometimes they're a little slow, but just give yourself enough time and you'll leave full and happy! This will definitely be on my rotation of take out restaurants!",

    "text": "If you want good traditional Mediterranean food, please give Jasmine Grill a try. The owners are a family from Jordan (brothers and sisters) and are the sweetest people. My husband and I have been there at least 6 times since they have been opened which is only a few weeks. I always get the chicken kabob and I love it. It comes with salad, rice, grilled tomato and onion.  I opt out for the rice (I'm not a big rice eater) and get the hummus instead. Their hummus is fresh and they garnish it with parsley, olive oil and cumin and that's what I like about it. It is the traditional way to serve it. I will try the tabbouleh next time and if it is as fresh as the hummus, I am sure I won't be disappointed! Also I would like to mention that it is listed in Ballantyne, but it is in Southpark/Southend neighborhood. South Blvd between Tyvola and Woodlawn. Give it a try!!!",

    "text": "Exceptional kebabs! The bill was about $13.00 out the door (LEAVE A TIP) for a combination kebab plate including chicken, kufta (ground lamb + beef and herbs mix), and beef (sirloin maybe) kebabs. The plate was massive and the kebabs were served on thick bed of rice with a grilled onion and a grilled tomato on opposing sides of the plate. If that isn't enough, they offer you a side item! You may choose from hummus, baba ganouj, salad, and about 3 other options I can't recall.  The baba ganouj was lacking... it wasn't the best I've ever had. They also serve it with a home made pita bread which is thinner than the pita to which I am accustomed, but it was good. I would have liked the pita served warm, but it was served at room temperature.  So why 5 stars after the previous paragraph? Because the entree was absolutely flawless. The beef was served in 4 glorious morsels cooked to a remarkably moist medium rare that was more medium than rare. It was also seasoned perfectly. You could taste the seasoning but also relish the succulent quality of the red meat.  The chicken was also exceptionally moist and tender. Seasoned to perfection, and the seasoning/marinated penetrated the chicken rather than simply resting on the surface.  The kufta was one of the finest examples of kufta which I have experienced and I can not say enough of wonderful things about it. If you've never had kufta, ignore the name and go for it! The name always put me off but it is absolutely my favorite meat on any menu.  The chef (and presumably owner) came to my table three times to inquire how my experience was, and asked how I'd heard about the place. I informed him that I'd heard about it from Yelp, and that I was just passing through on business. He was so grateful for the business and concerned about my experience that I felt compelled to write up the review.  The inside is certainly no frills, and the tv was a bit on the loud side (it was entertaining though), but this place was unfortunately empty on the Monday night I dined here. This place certainly needs your support. Get in there and give them your dollars. The food is spectacular and the owner(s) conscientious.   It's worth a try and at $13 OTD (not including tip) for a combo plate that could feed two, it's absolutely worth every single penny!",

When I opened yelp to look for a restaurant, their yelp ad was at the top. Apparently it was the first day of their ad run and I was very glad to find it. The food was fresh, made to order and very good. The hummus was lemony, just the way I like it. The Falafel was tasty, served with the sauce that was delicious. The staff was attentive, courteous and as a first timer to the restaurant wanted my dining experience to be good. The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing.

A landmark from south boulevard would be Panda Express.  We sat down and the waiter was nice. Very welcoming. The place wasn't packed, but it wasn't empty either. We ordered appetizers , falafel and hummus at the same time as entrees. The hummus was out quick, but the wait for the falafels began.    The waiter then brought out two out of the three entrees. So my wife and son started eating and I loaded up on hummus.  Then came my entree without the French fries I ordered. Out came the falafels, and then one out of two orders of French fries we ordered. It was just weird. Now we have everything we ordered.  The food was good. We've eaten traditional middle Eastern food in the Middle East and I have to say it was comprable. the falafels were freaking awesome. Made me even more mad that I had to wait so long for them.  It wasn't cheap. About $18 per person for lunch. It did feel nice supporting a small minority owned business",

I get the yellow rice because im Chinese and asians love to eat rice all the time, but also because the rice is yellow and it makes my food pictures a lot more vibrant. The chicken kabob and lamb chops are delicious. The chicken is juicy and flavorful. The lambchops are cooked well with a nice crust on the outside from being grilled over the open fire. Flavors are as bold as the colors. The garlic sauce and the hot sauce they give you is great for dipping as well. I like to dip my meat in both sauces combined. Great little spot.",

Again we were there before them, they were not even busy at all, the server were way more worried about clean table than to check on the customer. Not going back to eat and sit down there.

As a lover of Greek food, I saw the good Yelp reviews and thought I would give it a try.  I ordered the chicken shawarma with yellow rice and baba ganoush. My fiance ordered the beef and lamb shawarma with yellow rice and hummus. Everything we ordered was fantastic and very UNIQUE compared to other Greek/Mediterranean places I have eaten at in the past. I'm not sure if this place was more authentic or if they just did things differently than other places but they definitely know how to cook food.  The hummus was super creamy and the baba ganoush was very smokey and delicious. All the food comes with a little cup a spicy chili sauce and a cup of \"garlic dip\" that honestly looks like lard with garlic mixed in. Great service and food. Don't miss out!",

Like the last reviewer said, definitely don't judge the book by its cover!   Tucked away in an older strip mall and its exterior sign don't do it justice.  The staff are all so friendly and welcoming.  They have TVs playing the news.  Definitely a good spot for a mid-day break, or to even get some reading done while you're eating (if you're out on your own).",

It took a good 10 minutes to even get a menu.    I ordered the lamb shank. I love Lamb shank. I just don't like this Lamb shank as it is completely devoid of Any flavor.  How it is possible to make a shank tasteless is beyond me. However, everything else we ordered was very good.   Get it together Jasmine Grill.  This level of service is unacceptable.",

Ful Medamas, a fava bean dish served with pita bread, started me off and all by itself was a delicious and memorable meal. So many different flavors, all of them great. Followed wit tabouleh, lamb and shrimp kebab on yellow rice and a house salad, along with a cold, pink jasmine drink, and I realized I had two problems: I couldn't leave anything behind and there was too much beautiful, delectable food! I had a square of baklava to finish, although I was more than a little concerned that a Mr. Creosote incident might occur. It didn't. I rolled back to my room to sleep it off. Wonderful!",

The chicken kabab it one of the best I've eaten in the US. They serve lentil soup in the beginning and I don't know why but they serve it with a piece of lemon to be squeezed so that the juice goes in it. It hardly makes a difference because the lemon-like taste disappears in the soup. Anyways, it still tastes good - high in protein content.  I don't give a damn about sanitation ratings of this place. In my opinion, this place could be just as filthy or clean as an American/Indian/Asian/Italian restaurant.",

The owner was very hospitable after he came from the back room and he said he would have no issues if I wanted to order and/or eat-in at the restaurant (even though it was their closing time).    I had ordered the combination plate.  Everything such as the chicken kabob, hummus, rice, etc. tasted good and flavorful, except for the lamb kabobs, it was very well-done to the point it was black, hard and not edible.  When he asked me about the food, I told him that everything was good, except for the lamb was overcooked and he said he thought I wanted well-done because people of my origins (Pakistani/Indian) want well-done meats.  The portions were huge!  The bread was not what other customers were saying, homemade or fresh, because it was cold and dry.  Maybe they were out of it.  But I'm giving four stars for the customer service and other portion of my food.  The owner was very nice, friendly and catering -- allowing me to eat in at their closing time, and the portion of my meal was very big.",

I know how to make it and I know what it supposed to taste like and I haven't had at this good in Charlotte ever! The service was prompt and very friendly place appeared to be very clean the only thing I was a little bit disappointed in but it's OK is that their menu seemed a little limited. I like a more broad spectrum of offerings, but they are not a huge restaurant so if your hungry for a treat then they're a great place to go. They have some really nice appetizer platters that would be enough for me and my mother for two or three meals.  The amount of baba ghanouj that they gave me was twice as much as another place in Charlotte and half the price, And just as good if not better! Just one more reason for me to come to Charlotte all the way from South Carolina.",

It was very chewy and kind of gray.   Next came the salad, which was fresh, granted, but the dressing was a little bland. I also ordered the kofta platter, which came with rice. The addition of peas and carrots to the rice was nice. The kofta was pretty good, but over salted.   A valiant effort, but I would not recommend.",

The chicken was juicy and well cooked.. The wrap was tasting great. I was quickly done eating that fully and ran upto the desk ordering one more... The person at the counter also served a small Baba Ganoush as complimentary...   This being my first meal in Charlotte I would say it was Overall a really best welcome to me here. :)   Only 1 point about the shawarma was the quantity... it was a bit moderate for a price of ~$7. It can be filled with some more chicken.   Recommended if you are searching good food in Charlotte...",

    "text": "My wife and I had a late lunch here today, our first visit to this \"Mediterranean\" restaurant on South Boulevard. We found the our waiter to be most courteous and friendly, and very knowledgable about each item on the menu (adequate without being lengthy). The restaurant is fairly small, though pleasant, with bright colors and wooden chairs and tables. The noise level was a bit too much, thanks to the loud exhaust fan over the cooking area (at the rear of the room, open to the customers). This made normal conversation a little tough for us 60+ yr olds.  The salads were fresh, with pita chips and a simple but delicious oil & vinegar dressing. I had the lamb kabob, with hummus on the side, while my wife had a falafel wrap. A basket of warm pita bread arrived with our entrees--terrific, especially with the hummus. My lamb was perfectly marinated, though over-cooked, I thought (I like mine rare or at most, medium rare). Nonetheless, absolutely delicious, with peppers and onions;  the accompanying yogurt & cucumber dipping sauce--not tzatziki, but actually better!--was the perfect complement to the kabob, helping me forget the lamb's lengthy stay on the heat. My wife spoke very little during the meal, a sign that she was busy enjoying her food too much to converse. I'll let her review her meal herself... Wonderful iced tea...period. I am a Southerner through and through, and appreciate fine iced tea: they have it at Jasmine. Had the lamb not been too done, I would have given 5 stars. No time for dessert. We will be back.",

    "text": "We love coming here! We've ordered both sit down and take out since we discovered Jasmine. The first experience I'm sure was a little off as staff was trying to send out a big catering order when we walked in. We waited patiently for someone to take out order, no biggie. I ordered the Fatoush salad and an order of falafels while the bf ordered the chicken shwarma plate with hummus and yellow rice. The food also took a little while but it was worth it, I think we both agreed that Jasmine trumps Kabob Grill. The prices are just right and the quality of food is great. The Fatosh salad was fresh and crisp with little bits of fried pita instead of croutons, its basically the house salad + fried pita. The falafels were also good as well, six large pieces for $3.99, pretty good in relative terms. My bf loved his chicken shwarma, good pieces of meat and it wasn't rubbery or dry. The rice was surprisingly flavorful.   We ordered the same items last night for take out. I was a little disappointed with the salad, clearly it was sitting out, the greens were wilting and the pita crisps were soggy. My bf plate was consistent with out sit down experience. I advise not to order salads for take out. Other than that, we will definitely be back, our favorite Mediterranean place in Charlotte so far.",

    "text": "Delicious. FRESH. Family owned. Open late. Delivery available.   Yes, it is True! I now have my favorite go-to Mediterranean restaurant on the SouthEnd/SouthPark side of town. It won't break the bank and you'll have plenty to eat.   It's a newly established restaurant taking the space of the latter Las Palmas Restaurant. The menu has a lot of dishes in Spanish as a way of honoring the Las Palmas crowd. Be like me though and skip over to the authentic Mediterranean dishes. The baba ganoush is the best I've had in Charlotte. Its smoky flavor almost had me licking the plate clean. My flexitarian side came out and I had to order the mixed plate with the beef, chicken, and lamb kofta kebab. OMG. Grilled to perfection. The dish comes with a fresh salad filled with cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce topped with freshly squeezed lemon juice, EVOO, and pepper.   As of now, there are a few things lacking because it's a new start-up place. For instance, it's not too vegetarian friendly. They only serve flan and cheesecake, but eventually want to have baklava and other Arabic desserts. In a week they'll serve breakfast and sometime in the future they want to add Hookas.   For those wanting to score a great lunch under $10, this is the place. For $7.99 on Tuesday, Wednesday, & Friday you get most anything on the menu.   I almost cried tears of joy when I saw that they offer delivery. Now my lazy self doesn't even have to leave my home or office as long as I live within 7 miles of the place.   The service is great. It's family owned. They don't serve alcohol (but the bar next door does).  Try it out and you won't regret it. They are open late until 9:30pm during the week and until midnight Friday and Saturday.",

In fact, almost everyone from my office has become a regular too!  The food is genuinely tasty, and at $6.99 for the lunch specials it's a steal! Lunch special includes salad, lentil soup, choice of grilled kebabs (usually chicken and beef kefte), choice of rice (white or fried with onions and peppers). It's a lot of food for a small price!! I usually skip the rice and get a plate of babaghanouj (smoked eggplant and spices, ground to a consistency like hummus) for an extra $1.00...it's the best I've ever had, served with warm pita bread.  I highly recommend this place...can't go wrong!",

Humus, grape leaves and baba ghanoog were ok. Fatoush salad looked like it has been sitting around and dressed for at least an hour. Lettuce was wilted and cucumbers/tomatoes transparent looking and soggy. That salad was disgusting. I believe owner and cook standing in front talking loudly in Arabic. I speak arabic and did not really want to know their issues. Server was horrible, chicken came after we were done eating. Some food sat on glass waiting for someone to bring to our table. I believe owners just stood there looking at food for at least a few minutes until they told the waitress who was sitting down playing with her phone  to take to her customers. Only reason this place has 2 stars is some food items were ok but not great, service was horrible, fatoush salad disgusting . Will definitely not be back. Had much better, and shocked at the reviews. Charlotte locals who commented good reviews really need to check out other locations.",

The service and quality of the dishes is always perfect. You can't go wrong with a chicken or shrimp kebab, their hummus, and I love the white rice. The sauces they serve with each dish are perfectly hot and sweet. The staff is always kind and quick, they know when you want to linger and enjoy a meal, and when you're really needing that take out order fast. It's a small spot, so be patient. I'd love for them to take over the empty space next door!",

So I'll get to it when I get to it. ''Ummm. What?! Excuse me. I didn't order anything out of the ordinary. ITS ON THE MENU and you don't want me to enjoy something this place sells. Nahhh. We walked out and as soon as we did this service rudely snatched the menus off the table and stormed away. Lmfaooo. Please get servers that know and can handle being a server. I know it tough, I've done it. But trust me. Your customers will pay you for your hard work. As a former manager of a restaurant I tend to tip mighty well because I know how hard it is.

The hot sauce on the side is really hot, but a nice flavor.  Then I saw something I'd never heard of, or at least remember... a dessert called Knaffeh.  I expected it to be a custard or flan.. it isn't.   The texture is unlike anything I've eaten, and the flavor is subtle.   Nothing like I expected, but it is great.   It's made to order so give yourself 20 minutes.  While I was enjoying it, my server brought out some baklava to try.   Arrggbhh   I only ate half the Arab, and will be struggling to finish the Knaffeh.   I think I'll force myself.   This is not a to-go item...  gotta eat it here.  Tee Hee... just went through my review... \"only ate half the Arab\"  that's a sentence I never thought I'd put on paper ;-)",

I don't consider myself overly dramatic but the fact this place has 4.5 stars is insane and a testament to the inaccuracy of Yelp ratings. I could write a book about everything wrong but here are the highlights:   -Terrible service: drinks, orders, food all took very long and it seemed like our presence was an inconvenience to the staff. Whole meal took forever -Place was dirty: many tables filled with dishes, when we entered it was unclear if we should seat ourselves, wait to be seated, or order at the counter -Food was not good: the chicken \"shawarma\" seemed like it was just sauteed in a pan and was dry, the salad was insanely tangy like it had way too much vinegar or lemon, the rice was meh, and the lentil soup was thin and room temp  Please avoid this place. I had high hopes as I love Mediterranean food. I have eaten it all over the US and in the middle east. Trust me, this place doesn't deserve your business.",

This place is situated in an inconspicuous, older strip mall that really needs to be revitalized. Don't expect anything spectacular in terms of atmosphere. It's small, usually warm inside, and could use an overhaul.   Prices are fair and you get a really nice sized portion for the money. The menu is simple and of course has all of your favorite Mediterranean dishes.   The food is great. I typically get the chicken kabobs, with yellow rice, hummus, and a side salad. The chicken is grilled very well and has a great flavor. It's never been too dry or bad tasting, in fact, none of their meats are. The rice is great (for rice) and the grilled vegetables are really tasty.     You won't be floored, but you'll be motivated to come back again and again. A solid 4/5.",

From the moment we walked into JASMINE GRILL I knew I was not going to enjoy my lunch. The seating is awkwardly situated and the decor falling apart. From the start it didn't seem like table service as the food appears to be cafeteria style, but a friendly gentleman greeted us and offered us a table immediately. They were pretty busy for lunch so I was hopeful that perhaps the local yelpers are right and the appearance is insignificant.   The menu is confusing if you're never had \"Mediterranean Food\" so we chose a couple of familiar items such as the Chewy \"Lamb\" Kebobs with bland white rice and bag frozen French fries and the Rack of Lamb w/ Yellow rice FULL of peas and vegetables accompanied by an unenthusiastic unknown soup.   The prices weren't horrible, but the food is definitely subpar at best! At a restaurant called JASMINE grill, you'd think they'd at least serve some Jasmine rice instead of that Uncle Bens poor excuse for rice. I'm not sure what the yelpers in Charlotte were thinking when they gave this place a 4/5 star rating.",

    "text": "We rushed to the Jasmine Grill for a fast lunch on a break during a one day conference on a Saturday. The restaurant wasn't crowded, and we were able to communicate our time constraint with the waitress. She was quick about taking our order and asked the cooks what items could be prepared quickly. These are the best falafels I've eaten. Better than any I had in the Middle East. They were green on the inside. Spinach? They were fresh, crispy on the outside, and tastey. I do like pitas but most places don't have special pitas. I asked about Jasmine Grill's pitas. The waitress said that they make the batter for their pitas. I would have to believe her, but they were taking pitas out of a bag. These weren't special like the falafels and humus, I'm sorry to report. There really isn't much by way of atmosphere, but the food is good and the staff we met were open and kind. Humus was plentiful, fresh, and tasted great. I liked the spices they sprinkle on, and I appreciated that they make a neat, line decoration with the spices rather than spreading them all over the humus. The waitress kindly offered us a to-go cup. Thank you, Yelp, for the helpful reviews that I read in choosing this restaurant, and thank you Jasmine Grill for a great, fast lunch!",

I'm wondering if it was there and I never saw it?  Anywho, in the last 5 months, I have probably been there 4 times and it keeps changing so I assumed that it was still new.  I was just there last month and today I went in and there was a new menu and new decor - again.   The first few times, they were not that attentive (verging on ignoring us - especially when we arrived) but the food was outstanding so it warranted more visits. Now, however, I can say that their service is staaaarting to match their food.  I have never had a bad meal there and their hummus is one of the best I have ever had (and I have been to the Middle East several times).  I'm not a huge fan of their baba ganoush, however.  Their lamb shank is a total steal at $9.99.  (It used to be $12.99 which is still pretty cheap.)  I'm a huge foodie and I think that this place is pretty darn good.  The oil/garlic/salt mixture is fan-freakin-tastic and I could bathe in it!  Typically I have gone for dinner and today I went for lunch.  It was only $6.95 and it was great.  I'm going to start adding this to my weekly rotation of places that I go since I really like it.",

I ordered my platter with jasmine rice which was fantastic. All of the meats were cooked well and seasoned perfectly. The kefta was a little over done but still very good.   I was a big fan of their hot sauce and the garlic paste. Their garlic paste was probably the best I'd ever had. It was not over powering at all. It was a perfect compliment.

For the past 2 years I can't visit Charlotte without stopping by Jasmine Grill. We have some comparable places in Atlanta, but their garlic sauce always falls short. Jasmine Grill's garlic sauce is PERFECTION with delicious kebabs/schwarma/yellow rice to match. The hummus is more savory than most places and I personally find that delicious. I may have to take some pints of garlic sauce and hummus back to Atlanta with me the next time I'm in town. You won't regret visiting this gem!",

    "text": "What can I say about Jasmine Grill? So much! I lived in Berlin, Germany and love small places like this one and eating Middle Eastern food. The prices vs. Germany are quite high, as they serve to an American crowd,  however, this type of food costs anywhere in Europe three times less. A Sharma sandwich with french fries costs EUR 4.50 (approx. USD 5), here it costs USD 9 plus taxes and tip. BUT!! it is so good and if you as I miss the Middle Eastern food from Europe or even from NY, you will come here often. And another fantastic thing is that the staff is incredibly! incredibly!! friendly. I always have almost tears in my eyes how kind and attentive they are. No matter if they are busy or not.  The place has plenty of parking upfront, it has approx. 15 tables and plenty of space for large groups. It is usually very busy on the weekends, but the waiting time is totally fine. The problem for many people who drive by is that it is not quite visible from the street as this place is located a bit lower than the street.  The owner cooks often and is quite involved in business and talking to guests personally, which is very nice.  I gave it five stars because it is a wonderful place with good tasting food and I understand that I cannot compare the prices with European prices, but it would surely make me stop by more often if I can just grab a Sharma sandwich to go for much less. Thanks for being in Charlotte!",

On my first visit there on yesterday, I had the mixed Kebab grill, and they kindly substituted lamb instead of beef (I also got the shrimp and chicken).  With this, my 2 sides were yellow rice and hummus.  Having used the Yelp app to check in, I also received a free drink offer, and was able to take advantage of that.  Lastly, I decided to also order their falafel appetizer.  Everything was great and very flavorful.  The price was exceptional.  I was thoroughly pleased and quickly realized that this place would be added to my rotation of yummy places to eat.  However I didn't know that I would be returning so soon!  I went there for lunch today with a co-worker.  We enjoyed the special for $6.99 (we chose the chicken Kebab with yellow rice, and that comes with salad and lentil soup).  Terrific deal...I appreciate that they don't skimp on the portion size though the price of this deal is amazing.  Like my experience on yesterday, today's visit did not disappoint either.  I thought (especially after reading the reviews) that it may be packed during the lunch hour, but thankfully (today, at least,) that was not the case at all.    Very satisfied with my experiences with Jasmine Grill... I will return again.",

But I'll have I admit, I saw the reviews commenting about the homemade bread, and I think they must have stopped making it in-house, because ours was cold, a bit dry, and pretty tasteless.    But the other portions of our meal were quite good, including the veggie plate, shrimp kebab, and mixed meat kebabs (chicken, beef, and lamb).  Their rice isn't the standard basmati rice - it's a fragrant and flavorful yellow rice with peas, carrots, and I believe, cardamom.    I love hummus and theirs is especially good.  They top it with olive oil and spices, which really add to the flavor.  Their baba is a bit chunkier than I've had at other places, and I enjoyed both the texture and flavor.  Their shrimp are large and seasoned really well.  My hubby loved the meat kebabs, and said the chicken was his favorite because it was so juicy.  You CANNOT get a meal here without ordering their cucumber-mint-yogurt dip on the side.  It's like raita, but better.  They make this fresh daily and slice the cucumbers into small chunks.  The flavor is AMAZING, and it really adds to the meal.   Jasmine isn't in the nicest shopping center, but there's plenty of parking because some of the other businesses have closed.  Despite the bread and location, we'll likely return.",

The food portions are quite large, so I ordered an entree and an app and shared it, and left stuffed. They have some pretty simple, safe options for those that are less adventurous in foreign foods. I was very pleased with the quality of food, including the meats. Doesn't seem like they cut corners on quality. I'll definitely be back!",

First off, get the hummus! It is amazing! I am not a fan of hummus but I was practically licking the plate to get all of the hummus I could. The hummus had olive oil in it and was very creamy.  I also had the lamb kebab and rice! Oh my gosh I highly recommend it! The lamb was tender and very flavorful and the rice paired great with it! Overall it is not an extensive menu but the things they offer seem to be really good and the price is very reasonable. My fiance ordered some kind of beef schwarma, which was also good. Both of our entrees came with 2 sides and each of them cost about $12-13. They are very generous servings. I had to get a box for mine. I definitely plan to make this a place that I will visit regularly.",

Accommodating - We ordered something that unfortunately they were out of but since we ordered online, they couldn't reimburse use without going through the online provider, so instead we asked if we could supplement out what was available that equaled the same price  Food was missing - the only reason they are not getting 5 stars. The veggie delight was supposed to have grape leaves and they weren't included (was so looking forward to those!). We were also told that our baked pies would be a mix of meat and cheese/spinach. Being a vegetarian, I was very disappointed to see they were all meat, just 2 different kinds...",

    "text": "If you want a dressy experience with copper and mosaics and pretty decor with high-paid and well-dressed staff...this isn't the place for you.  If, however, you want exceptional Mediterranean food at a very reasonable price made and served by some hard-working people, go to Jasmine Grill. We have bounced around from Mediterranean place to Mediterranean place and found good to very good food but I doubt we will look elsewhere now.  The owner is Syrian by birth, so some of the food was a little different from the predominately Lebanese recipes we have tasted for baba ganoush and hummus. Both were the best we have had in the city. We watched them make the tabbouleh fresh (and boy did it taste it), and had to wait for the knafeh to bake because it was also scratch made. Knafeh is one of my favorite desserts and what we had before simply doesn't compare to the quality of Jasmine Grill's.   For the carnivores, my husband raved about the lamb and beef shawarma and my chicken kebabs were delicious. The yellow rice that accompanied both was moist, perfectly seasoned and replete with veggies. I honestly don't know how the chef manages such creations in so small a kitchen and boy, does he work his backside off.  I subtracted one star because, yes, the place is a little down at heel and could be cleaner in spots and yes, the service could be a little absent-minded. But if you get takeaway and don't give a hoot about either of those things, consider this a solid five stars.   We will be back, and very soon.",

The location is small and in the middle of lots of closed businesses, might be easy to miss.   This place serves Middle Eastern cuisine - a sign in the restaurant specifies the owner is from Syria I believe. It's a casual environment, nothing very fancy. You can dine in or take out. Falafel, chicken, yellow rice, Kababs - they have the works. While the menu isn't huge or extensive, they cook some middle eastern favorites. I tried the falafel special, which comes with a salad and a lentil soup. The soup was okay. The falafel and rice were okay.   It took well over 25 minutes to get my food, and no one even stopped to ask me if I needed anything or explain why there was a holdup. Totally my personal opinion, but I believe they were a bit understaffed for the size of the crowd. I've since been notified they've hired 4 more employees, because it gets pretty busy in here! The owner promptly realized there was a bit of a hiccup with our order, and graciously attended to us personally and even threw in a free dessert to apologize. I appreciate good service, and that they care about the customer experience.",

Note, my review is actually 2.5 stars, details to follow.   Located and tucked away in a strip mall off South Blvd, near Tyvola, Jasmine Grill is easy to miss. Once you visit once, you won't forget.  The restaurant is decent sized, but gets so busy it seems tiny!   Came on a Friday, for lunch and it was packed! We ordered hummus to start. I got the falafel platter with fatoush salad and rice. My BF got the falafel wrap with fries.  The hummus was fantastic.  Creamy, rich, just enough smoked paprika and olive oil on top. The rice was cold and underwhelming. The fatoush was good, cucumber heavy though. My BF's wrap was good, but lacking. There were 3 tiny falafel broken into pieces,  it was child sized.   The service was bad. 1 server for the entire restaurant. Really y'all?!! He ran around like a chicken with no head. I watched my salad sit on the counter for 10 minutes.   The main reason for the 2.5 stars is..... THE SANITATION SCORE! 87, B. That only is a reason for me to pass on a second visit.",

We were ravenous and as soon as she brought the baba ganoush and the fattoush which were sides we devoured them. The food did finally come out and I had ordered the shawarma plate with yellow rice. The rice was absolutely delicious! The shawarma was good too but the rice was something else! Hubby got the kofta kebab which to me looked dry but when I tried it, it was moist and delicious! I did get a free fanta by checking in on yelp!  I would try this place again but would hope that the service is better!",

But,  it's a testament to how good this food is. Here are my recommendations:  1. If you have not had the fried Koba,  do yourself a favor and just try it once.  2. The hummus is really good.   3. The fatoush salad is really good with grilled chicken.  4. Im super picky about eating meat. The chicken here is always fresh- not like a lot of restaurants where you can literally taste the chicken losing freshness. Must be because of the high demand for the food here. It's packed every time I come.  4. The pita bread is good.  5. Plenty of veggie options.  Get the mini mazza platter.   I'm Lebanese and to me this is better Lebanese food than other restaurants I've tried in Charlotte.",

The texture is smoother and the strong flavor of olive oil is yummy. The kabob options are a good way to go and adding lots of the garlic aioli type stuff is just off the charts. The pitas are a bit lacking and seemed old. The service is also a little mixed since our order came out in pieces and there was also some serious confusion when ordering.

It was right around lunch time and the restaurant was filling up so I place my order to go.  I ordered the mixed kebab with chicken and lamb, my two sides were yellow rice and hummus(which comes with pita bread).  The salad looked really good, so I ordered that as well.  There was a short wait for my food and everything was delicious, and very fresh. The lamb and chicken were seasoned and grilled extremely well, melt in your mouth good with grilled onions and peppers served on the side.  I don't think I've ever had hummus so creamy and flavorful, but the side of pita was just ok but not the best. The rice and salad were both great.  They serve a few sauces with the food but I didn't need any of them, everything was perfect without having to add anything.  I will definitely visit again soon.",

Some things that happened tonight that I took a star away:   When we walked in, the tables were dirty, even if cleared. They ran out of regular Coca-Cola (on a Friday night?!). It also took a really long time to pay our bill; I got up and had to hand it to someone. Even then, the wrong cards got charged the wrong bill.   Tonight was a miss on the above, but multiple times before I've not had these issues. It seemed like maybe new management? I'll go back and see if it's a new norm or just a one-time miss.",

The food was great and the presentation was that of a high end restaurant, a very clean and colorful presentation. The service was very efficient and friendly. I hope I get back there before I leave town.",

    "text": "Two words: Lamb chops! We tried this  restaurant for carryout because I had a coupon and  it was not too far from the groomer where we would be picking up the dog. Serendipity!    The aroma from the carryout bag had both my dog and me ravenous by the time we got home. Opened the box and saw lamb chops with perfect grill marks fanned across yellow rice studded with veggies. Just had to pick one up lollipop style and take a bite-- tender, perfect medium rare, and flecked with an herb mix that enhanced the meat and gave it just a hint of heat. Don't miss the garlic yogurt butter spread-- nice addition to rice. The bright, citrusy dressed salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, feta and mint added a summery balance. We even opted to open a nice bottle of red, given the entree quality! Later, yummy homemade baklava provided a perfect end to the meal. At $20 (inc tip) for one generous entree and dessert,  shareable by two with modest appetites, or as dinner for one with enough leftovers for next day lunch, a very good value!      Carryout service was swift and friendly. I was even offered a beverage while I waited.     Interior is simple--think fast casual-- and it has several big tables where groups or families would feel welcome.       Worth the 20 minute drive from my house for a return visit-- even if the dog isn't at the groomers nearby! In fact, planning in being a regular and want to try other offerings--IF we can ever pass up those yummy lamb chops!",

From Hummus to seafood and meat. Can't tell what we have ordered but I did take pictures. I even walked up to the chef who was actually the owner of the restaurant. Sure I'll come back again!  Todate, in June, my son came from SFO & we like to dine out.  As we knew this place close early, we came before 6:00 to avoid crowd.  We had the fruit juice even we could have free soda that I really didn't care.  We ordered the lamb kebob and lamb shank.  They were so delicious.  Besides the owner chef, I've seen 2 more chefs.  The food was very good as my son did like it.  The place had become popular now.  Hope they have more servers or servers have to work faster.  No reservation to share, good place to go for good food and the price is very acceptable.",

Really a good amount. Served with a basket of Pita Bread. Then all three of us got the Fatoush Salad with Chicken Schwarma. Great chopped up salad covered with big chunks of white chicken that was dipped in spices and grilled...tender and juicy. I wish I would have had room left for some Baklava but I was stuffed!

I was excited when I happened to see the sign for Jasmine Grill as I was driving down Cherry Road. I pulled in and got an order to go. I was surprised when I got home and found the portions to be very minimal and haphazardly thrown into the container. I had wondered why my bag felt so light as I was leaving. I wish I'd opened it before I left. It was barely enough food to qualify for a kid's meal. The small container that the hummus was in wasn't even half full. They had pushed it onto the sides of the container so that there was hardly anything in the middle. Very poor for an $11 meal (with tax). Rock Hill needs good restaurants, but this isn't it.",

The place is small and it was pretty crowded. Almost every table was taken. They were short staffed. There was one server working the floor for one large party and about 7 or 8 smaller tables. There was one cook and that was it for the staff.   From the time we walked in and sat down, no one greeted us, no one brought us a menu or a drink or took our order...no one ever came to the table. We sat there for about 25 minutes trying to get the server's attention, but he just rushed around without stopping at our table. We finally ended up leaving because we both had to get back to work.  The quality of the food has also started slipping a bit since I first came into their place  about 6 months ago. They have dishes with avocados on the menu, but are always \"out\" of avocados when I order something. They frequently forget items when I get a take out, and I have to check my order carefully every time I'm there.   I think the good reviews on Yelp have caused their traffic to go up, especially at lunch, and they just haven't been able to handle it. I'll probably go back once more, but if service and organization don't improve soon, I'm probably going to mark it off of my list.",

Wraps come with fries as a side. plates come with a side of your choosing & are so large you could easily feed two people. I went with beef & lamb shawarma plate and it did not disappoint.    Not sure what the white sauce is but dang it's good!",

The lamb and beef were ok, but it's more of a personal preference that I didn't enjoy them as much , nothing they did wrong. This was our first time there and definitely won't be the last.",

The chicken kebab was alright it was a little too dry for my taste. Same goes for the falafel. I have no idea what the white sauce that came with the order was, but it tasted amazing with the falafel. The rice that came with the kebab was also very very very dry I had a hard time swallowing it. Shrimp kebab, French fries, and the fatush salad were amazing esp the salad.   Customer service was bad. The waitress with too much lipstick was slow and lazy. She was rude too she didn't even bother to greet me or anything. Not even a smile. The dude with the beard that gave me my food took forever and didn't even hand it to me. I also ordered the baba ganoush which they ran out of and didn't even bother to call to tell me!!!!! I'm very pissed off by their service and I felt very uncomfortable the 5 min I was there. The service is why I'm never coming back here. Unless they fire that waitress.",

I had a chicken shwarma (?) sandwich that left me wanting more and needs something with a twang in it. Either a pickle or that plant that's pink that's found in Mediterranean food. Hope I don't sound ignorant. Long story short, it's a decent choice for lunch. I think I need to give it a second try dining in.",

It's not about the sparse atmosphere, it is all about the food and all the flavors.  My taste buds felt like they went to a party on steroids!  First started with the Fatuch salad, which I cannot even describe other than it had a light lemony dressing on it and was topped with fried pita chips.  Then I had the chicken kabob with hummus, instead of the rice.  Again, I cannot even describe all the flavors in either the chicken or the hummus.  The hummus was whipped up like potatoes, kinda.  The whole time I was eating, I was squealing with culinary delight.  I almost never order dessert, but just had to try what the next table over was eating.   It is called KNAFEH.   Apparently it is a dessert found in Palenstine.  If for no other reason you go to this restaurant, go for this dessert.   There just aren't words.   For a few moments, we felt as if we had left Charlotte for either a Middle Eastern country or maybe NYC.  We'll be talking about this experience for many moons.   I may not brush my teeth tonight because I want to keep the flavors in my mouth.   Double wow.",

The food is GOOD and pretty authentic too. I got to try a few things last night which included hummus, baba ghanoush, fattoush, yellow rice, lamb chops, kefta kebob, chicken souk, steak kebobs, and of course kanefh . All good but what stood out to me was the baba ghanoush, lamb chops, and kanefh. The baba ghanoush was super fresh and I love the smoked flavor. The lamb chops were surprisingly tender and delicious- will come back for! Oh and the kanefh...Well first it's a big portion so plan to share with your company and second they make it fresh to order so it will take a few minutes. Oh but so worth the wait, definitely up there with the best I have ever had! FYI the food reheats well too!",

We had the super family combo that feeds 6 people and comes w/yellow rice, beef, chicken, and lamb kabobs (we got the lamb chops, which has an upcharge to make sub) and an app of ur choice. Our waiter, who was a sweetheart, let us  split to get the baba-g and hummus. I was not crazy about the flavor of the chicken (but the rest of fam loved it), but that was not a problem since the beef and lamb were incredibly juicy, flavorful, and plentiful. I also had the \"jasmine drink\", which was a delish fruit smoothie-ish drink.   We also had the pistachio baklava and we discovered the Palestinian dessert knfa, which is just indescribably good! We had the coffee as well, and while very good w/the hint of cinnamon, it was not as strong as I would have liked and the little cup was almost half grounds. So, hoping that was a one off.  All in all a great experience. Though, be prepared for slow service, which is more a cultural thing than an issue of the quality of said service.",

The staff was very informative and friendly. We were so hungry which isn't a good thing when trying a new restaurant because we wanted to order one of everything on be menu just about.  We started with the Baba Ganoush which is something we both never tried. The server was very informative and told us that it's basically egg plant, the pictures looked like hummus so we were intrigued. He brought it out and it was DELICIOUS he then brought us the hummus to try just because it was it first choice (score). We also had a house salad appetizer which was so GOOD.  Main courses includes Garlic Tilapia with yellow rice and Mixed Kabobs (lamb, beef, shrimp & chicken). The food was good and this is definitely a place to grab a bite when in the area. They also offer fresh juice and I had a mango and pineapple freshly squeezed which was so refreshing.",

    "text": "Jasmine Grill is a fantastic casual Middle Eastern food joint with extremely reasonable prices.  We started with hummus, labneh, and baba ganoush. The first two were excellent, and the baba ganoush is the best I've ever had. Smooth, tangy, and smoky, it was a real treat. For less than $5, they are pretty as hell too!  We also tried their baked pies - four for $4. We wanted to try their entire variety but they were out of beef so we had two cheese, a spinach, and I believe a chicken (it had some heavily flavored filling and was my favorite of the lot).  For my entree I got the mixed grill kebob - chicken, beef, and lamb. All grilled expertly, tender, and well-seasoned. I got it over yellow rice that was just as flavorful as everything else. My wife got the chicken kebob over yellow rice and it was more of the same, and just as good.  For getting two starters (hummus and baked pies, the baba ganoush and labneh were one of the two sides that came with our mains along with yellow rice) and two entrees, of which the mixed grill is the most expensive thing on the menu at $15, and two drinks, our total came to less than $40. You can't beat that with a stick.  Service was great, and they have a really slick iPad-based ordering system. Food came out fast and we were never waiting long. I've finally found my Middle Eastern mainstay. Next time, desserts!",

I gave it a little extra time and arrived 20 minutes later.  It was pretty packed when I walked in and the servers were hectic; there was no one at the front counter and no indication of where to go to get a pickup order. Apparently they have tablets to swipe cards at the back by the counter and soda machine (and in the travel lane of servers). After realizing this I stood at the back until someone finally asked if I was picking up. There was some confusion. The cooks hadn't even started my order, so I got to stand around awkwardly for 10 minutes watching them cook other people's food first as I tried to avoid the flying servers. The girl trying to help me was very nice and apologetic, but she also put so much ice in my coke that I literally only had 8 sips.  If the food had been really good, I would give it another chance, but unfortunately that was not the case. Each side of my wrap had only two sad, tiny pieces of falafel, some lettuce, and what can only be described as salsa fresca. The fries were just OK- typical frozen variety.",

Upon arriving you are greeted by the hostess, owner, cook, etc.  who is friendly and accommodating.  Having only been to a few Mediterranean places, falafel was a definite must to try at Jasmine.  So, I started with the falafel appetizer, six amazing falafel balls, with a great dipping sauce. The falafel was by far one of the best of have had in Charlotte and have since been back to Jasmine just to enjoy those. That same evening I ordered the Chicken Kabob dinner, whoa a lot of food.  The chicken was cooked too perfection served with grilled vegetables and yellow rice.  Unfortunately, unlike others, the garlic sauce served with the dish was a little too much for my taste. I have also enjoyed the falafel pita and some other sides. Overall, Jasmine has great food.  Service is good, however, be prepared to enjoy your time there as this is a two man show, so food comes out one table at a time.",

Third was the state of the men's restroom. There were towel paper on the ground, the towel bowl brush was lying on the ground.  There were open trays of baklava, steps from the restrooms.

Thus, every time I want a good lunch option with a small bit of exercise when I am working from home, Jasmine Grill always pops in my head (usually it's a debate between Jasmine, Crispy Bahn Mi, or one of the million Mexican joins near there!)  Yesterday I called in a Jasmines Grill order for pick up. I have never actually sat down and eaten in this restaurant but typically all the tables are full, especially for lunch! My favorite thing on the menu is the hummus. Easily one of the best in Charlotte.   On this particular occasion, I ordered chicken kabobs and substituted hummus instead of rice. Always substitute hummus!! The lunch orders come with a house soup and house salad. They even threw a bag of pita in for me! I am not a huge fan of the house salad as it is more mint leave inspired. However, their soup (I think it is lentil???) is a pureed delicious concoction of a soup. They also threw in a side of this garlic paste like substance that was super tasty on the chicken! All of this for $8. Score.   Jasmine Grill is a bit hidden off of South Blvd (really just look for the purple gawdy Panda Express Building...it's behind that) but give it a try. Totally worth it!",

I am no \"mid eastern cuisine expert,\" but each time, the food seemed consistently great to me:  falafel, hummus, baba ganoush, foul madamas, lentil soup, and kabobs.  About a month ago, when I dined in, the dishes had not been carried away from most of the tables, and the  cleanliness appeared less than spotless-perfect.  However, the food was great.  On around August 25, I ordered dishes to go but did not call ahead.  The dining area was much, much cleaner and better kept, but the large  number of people waiting to pick up their to-go orders created a bit of a backlog for the folks fulfilling the to-go orders.  All in all, I'll be back but will call ahead.  One final thought:  no alcohol.",

The Kafta kabob  ($10)- mix of ground lamb, beef, spices- comes w/ yellow rice, grilled tomato and onion and a side of your choice. Simply excellent!  4 stars  I got the Humus as a side... it was interesting. It was presented with stripes of Cumin and paprika and a bit of fresh mint floating in a small wading pool of olive oil in the middle of it all. I liked the flavor the unusual garnish gave it but I thought the hummus lacked something ... maybe tehini? 3 stars  My companion had a falafel wrap, it comes with fries. The falafel wrap was very good but the there was no dressing in it. Again tehini may have helped but there's a number of sauces that would have worked. The fries were the standard kind but they were nicely crispy and we ended dipping them into the humus, which worked great. 3 1/2 stars.     We also tried the Cheese Burek, these were deep fried as opposed to baked, it tasted OK but honestly personally I much prefer the baked phylo kind.  The only bad note was the ice cubes had taste to them, they gave us fresh bottles of water to make up for it.  With Jasmine on the West side of town, Le Shish kabob on the East side and Kabob Je in Matthews, Charlotte certainly has Arabic food well covered.",

They lose a star because they looked like they were struggling to manage their crowd - it took us 5 min to be noticed and another 15 to be seated and there was confusion between our group and their group as to who had what table and the staff didn't help. In the end we had to negotiate with another seated party to change tables in order to accommodate us. Wait staff looked very stressed. That said, would still definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Had a party of 8 today for lunch and everyone at the table had a great time. Easy to find and tons of parking up front. Place had plenty of sitting with a decent atmosphere. Good service, even though our waiter could have use some help.   The food was fantastic (Kebabs,Shawarma Plate,Tahena Salad etc...)  I personally tried the Arab Style Shawarma Wrap and it was delicious, I highly recommend it if you haven't tried it.  The food took a while to arrive at the table, which does happen when the meat has to be grilled for a party of 8... that was really the only downside, every thing else was just perfect.   Will definitely go back again for lunch, probably next week and try different things on the Menu.",

    "text": "This place deserves as many stars as I can give.  I'm not amazingly familiar with Mediterranean or Middle Eastern fare, but this restaurant gives a great foray into the cuisine.  I enjoyed a Beef Kofka lunch, which came with lentil soup, house salad, and rice.  Everything was top notch.  I also had a side order of Hummus, and maybe I've been missing out on decent hummus my entire life because this stuff was phenomenal.  It was even presented in an aesthetic fashion.  The beef had a perfectly light crisp on the outside while still retaining a nice level of juicy meatiness on the inside.  Perhaps one of the better things about this restaurant is it seemed all of the employees here actually wanted to be there.  They were all smiles and genuinely seemed to enjoy their customers.   Bon Appetite.",

    "text": "I went here for lunch and ordered the chicken kabob. The waiter was very friendly and attentive, but the wait time for the meal was ~20 minutes (this was also considering that I was the only customer there at the time). With that being said though, the food was solid. The meal came with a thick and hearty lentil soup and fresh cucumber/lettuce/tomato salad in addition to the well grilled chicken kabob and rice. Do yourself a favor and mix in the garlic mayonnaise and spicy salsa, which adds a tangy kick to the chicken. For $6.99 + tax, this was great value.",

The beef kebab was fantastic. The hummus and babba ganoush were delicious, as were the grape leaves and the falafel. I have to admit, my babba ganoush is better, but theirs is pretty good. I was very happy with my food. Very, very happy.",

The lunch special is $6.99 and comes with soup, salad, and main course which I almost never am able to finish -- it's a good amount of food. The rice is particularly very good, I'm not sure why, but it is way better than typical american restaurant rice.  It is oddly empty every time I visit but don't let that deter you.",
