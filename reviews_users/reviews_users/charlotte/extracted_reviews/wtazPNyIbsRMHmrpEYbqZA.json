    "text": "I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and always received pretty decent service. The food is always tasty and never really found that service was an issue until my last visit. I had a Jamaican visitor and she want hard dough bread to go with our dinner. Now I could have gone a couple of different places but I chose the Bakery. I love this bread but I typically only eat it when in NY, Jamaica or Florida because I need my hard dough to be as fresh as possible.  While the seemingly nice woman was ringing me up I politely asked \"how old is the bread?\" Now I know this is called a bakery but everyone knows their baked goods are shipped in. She responds by saying \"the bread is fresh.\" I say your idea of fresh and mine maybe 2 different things. She became a maniac but in a calm way. She asks: do you want the bread or not? At the time I really just needed to get the bread and leave, dinner was waiting. But not before I explained that as a consumer and patron of this store I have a right to know how old something is in a darn bakery that doesn't bake anything.   After the fact, i was very upset because I could have gone somewhere else, and for her think that it was OK to respond in that manner bothered me. Why was she so combative in the first place? In the end, she told me their shipments come every Tuesday. So this would be the best day to visit if you need baked goods. I myself, will never spend another nickel there.",

On both occasions, I've had the dinner combo ($8-$10).  The food itself is pretty good.  I had the Jerk Chicken and the Curry Goat, both of which were not too spicy. The plates are served with generous helpings of rice and red beans and another side, usually steamed cabbage or collards.  The meat portions was kinda slim.  But the service?  A total take-a-number-and-wait-for-me-to-move attitude pervades this place.  The line was long and the staff were slow to move.  Geez!  My buddy and I sat in the back dining hall, which they closed off with a wet floor sign as they were closing in an hour.  RUDE!  I had to walk around it to get a drink refill.  If you want cheap Caribbean food for takeout, this might be a OK place.  I'm sure that there is a Caribbean joint with more personable service and exceptional food.",

I spoke to the owner and the pleasant staff and found out they have a new chef which they gave rave reviews. I was pleasantly surprised that the were indeed correct.

Walking into the restaurant it was extremely humid and hot so I assume the air condition was not working. My family and I proceeded to order since we were starving. We ordered the Curry chicken with rice and beans and cabbage, Oxtails with rice and beans and cabbage and Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and cabbage. We also added 2 spicy beef pattys, they did not have any more regular beef pattys, I was disappointed. With it being so hot in the restaurant I wanted a Large ice water BUT their fountain drink machine was not working and they did not have any bottle waters. The only drinks that were available were bottled juices that I was not interested in. So I walked over to Shane's to buy a large drink. After returning with my large drink in hand my family and I ate dinner. The curry chicken was my favorite out of all the entrees we ordered but I was disappointed in my plantains were very soggy and not fried long enough. The oxtails disappointed me the most. They were not seasoned and did not really have a taste. Overall my experience here was just ok, I hope Golden Krust improves the obvious issues and bring back the original Golden Krust.",

With that said, if you're looking for patties look no further because they're simply the best ever! Buttery, flaky, fat-laden pastry, filled with chicken, beef or shrimp! Yes, it is a chain and the patties are shipped in but they're baked in house daily and trust me they're addictive!  Now, the food overall has been fresh and pretty solid, but over the years it has been a tad inconsistent, but everyone has a bad day so I haven't held that against them. I had my very first oxtail here several years ago and I've been ordering them ever since, but I must say my favorite is still the curry chicken. The oxtails and curry chicken are both seasoned just right with plenty of gravy.........it's all about the gravy. I know most people think of jerk chicken when coming to Jamaican restaurants but since I'm not a jerk type of chic, I can offer no insight on that entree:-) Golden Krust has been serving up solid Jamaican food in Charlotte for years and though there are other decent Caribbean spots in the city, I continue to return to the Krust.......",

Then if you ask for more rice you get told \"no!\"  What kind of service is that?! I got a whole lot of gravy though! Ugh theyre rude too! Now the food Id rate a 4...maybe 3.5.

It's small and tucked away in the shopping center, but you visibly see the sign for the place.  The menu isn't that big, so you for sure will not be overwhelmed with too many choices.  I have gone here twice now and definitely recommend the Goat Curry or the Oxtail meal.  I don't know about you, but when I ordered these, I also asked for extra gravy.  It was great to have the extra gravy with the rice and cabbage. Note that when you order the meal, it doesn't come with a drink though.  Kinda a bummer on that part.   The place is alright, pretty small.  They have tables near the register, and also near the back.  I haven't been towards the back to see how many tables there are as I have only gotten take out.  The prices are a little pricey to me, but the food was worth it.",

In Brooklyn, Golden Crust is probably a last resort for Jamaican cuisine, but it seems that here in the Queen City it's the only place to get some decent stew, curry, and jerk. The patties are excellent too! Also try the bakery items like the sweet potato bread, they're always fresh.  The service is good enough too, I can't complain at all about this place. After a few months here, I thought I would be cooking all Caribbean food myself but Golden Crust has saved me the trouble.   Will be returning again and again!",

I have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite. And if you're looking for a cold bottle of Ting or a piece of rock cake, this is your place. Did I mention the spicy patties? Wow, they are delicious. Growing up in Miami, we had a favorite place to go for patties. Here in Charlotte, this is our favorite place.

    "text": "Right off the bat, don't go to this place expecting warm and cheery service. Just focus on the food to keep your satisfaction levels in check.  I met some friends here after work based on their recommendation. When we got there, it was empty (this was around 5:30 on a Monday evening) but definitely picked up as time passed.  This was my first time eating Jamaican food (I know!) and I wasn't all that hungry so I hemmed and hawed over the menu for a little bit. I went with the spicy chicken Jamaican patty and a pineapple-flavored Jamaican soda. There's a case of bottled Jamaican sodas or cans of American sodas (coca-cola, pepsi, or mountain dew). FYI - they don't always have all of the patties listed on the menu available to order so just ask before you get too committed to a particular flavor. The woman went into the back and came right back out with my patty. Nice and warm, ready to eat.  I went into the back seating area while my friends finished placing their orders. The patty was a fluorescent yellow color which threw me off a little bit but when I bit into it, my fears were long forgotten. The patty crust was flaky and had a little bit of a sweet flavor that balanced the mild heat from the meat inside. The Jamaican soda was very sweet, which should come as no surprise since its second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. It's definitely not anything I would probably have again but it was good enough to wash down my patty. I got to taste a bit of my friends' meals and I really, really enjoyed the jerk chicken. The chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful. It's definitely some I would order on my next visit. Also, the coco bread was/is a winner.  Overall, a good spot to get your introduction to Jamaican food and/or to indulge your already long-held affection.",

I actually think the chicken was left overs from a few days ago. The sauce tasted like barbecue sauce with hot sauce in it and the mac and cheese was very bland. They are always running out of things, today they ran out of plantains.",
