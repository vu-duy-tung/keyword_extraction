    "text": "I find it incredibly interesting that people will comment and leave bad reviews for places over things the business has NO, and let me emphasize, NO control over. I read a review here about urine on the floor in the bathroom. No it was not, it was water. I was there. If the reviewer had spent the extra moment to look around they would have noticed that one of the nasty guests left the toilet plugged and full. That is where the smell was coming from. I can only imagine what the house looks like of those guests, but of course, it is the restaurant's fault that these nasty people are allowed in public. Oh wait, maybe some of the other disgusting, nasty things that guests so in the bathroom should be listed too!  I don't even want to go down that road. I was in the restaurant on the day this person commented on what the kitchen must look like because of nasty guests in the bathroom. Nice comparison, but guests don't go in the kitchen so that stays clean. Did anyone let someone know the bathroom was in need of attention, nope, again, leave a bad review. Well, guess what, I did let the manager know and it was immediately taken care of! Most people on here have never worked in a restaurant and have no clue what it takes to run one. So what, the manager was at the hostess station, I guess this person knows they shouldn't be there?  Guess what, when I was a manager, I spent a lot of time at the hostess station. Why???? Because it is the first thing the guest sees!!!!  Some day, we will all wake up and realize that sites like this do nothing for anyone. Do you write a review EVERY time you have a good experience??? I mean, EVERY time???  Nope, only supposed bad ones. So, they forgot your potatoe, silverware, whatever. It is amazing at how incredible perfect all these reviewers are. Never forgetting something, never making a mistake. Did your mother not teach you to shut your mouth unless you had something nice to say?  Guess not, it is all about you.  So take my review and commentary on other posts as you may.  This Outback is the best one ever. Everyone from the hostess, cooks, servers, managers, and the owner, Valerie, are top notch. They create great food and they do whatever they can to make EVERYONE happy!  My hat's off to you all!",

It took 20 mins for drink orders and bread . Our waiter was visibly dripping sweat and in top of that Sat on the floor in front of our table multiple times too take our order and check on our table ..... super weird . Missing multiple items , overcharged my debit card by $20. Cold food , watery drinks .... Waiter asked to taste my watery drink to check for flavor .... I wish I was making this up ! Asked for a manager and was told this is the second complaint I've got about him tonight he really needs to step it up , never offered a discount an apology , didn't comp anything on our ticket . I'll never return , don't waist your time here guys",

    "text": "As an Outback fan, I have to say my visit to the Pineville location off Pineville-Matthews road in Charlotte was the worst visit in 16 years of visiting Outback.  I went Saturday night September 26th 2015 at 6:30 pm. I sat at the bar and the negativity and rudeness of the bar staff was appalling. My date walked in and slipped and fell on the greasy and slick floor. The entire bar area floor was slick and greasy. I was sliding all over the floor while walking. Due to the bartenders rudeness, I decided to grab a bar table as I anticipated bad service at the bar.  The guy waiter was not much nicer. He was rude and had no interest in serving us. I did order and once the girl brought my steak, she literally dropped it on the table and kept walking. Typically they ask if you need anything else but the girl seemed agitated when I asked her for A1 steak sauce.   The waiter finally brought it and did not check back one single time while eating. He did not refill our drinks nor did he ask or care how we enjoyed our meal.  I have been going to this outback for 2 years. I have seen a major decline in the service and management of this location. The manager seemed over her head, the staff all seemed miserable, and the cloud of negativity surrounding the staff is embarrassing for the outback company. I will never visit this location again and will also write outback personally.",

The coconut shrimp was spot on tasty which I shared with the wife and she agreed. The grilled shrimp and both steaks had way too much pepper (just a smidgen less than blackened) for our tastes. They were both cooked to our requested levels. We will probably come back here again but will absolutely tell them to lighten up on the pepper. They did have a salad dressing that I tried for the first time and found quite nice, Blue Cheese vinageret.",

Wait was 15 minutes or so, plenty of seating inside at 5:00 pm Seated-handed three diferent menu types, a little much to look at. Waitres did not have a smile, can't blame her. I order sirloin and grilled prawns. Steak was +A, I only got four prawns and they where puny. My son got a fillet which was good, but his bottom less prawns was so slow to refill that we had dessert before he could get a third helping.  My wife asked for an end cut prime rib and the cook substituted a seared prime rib enstead without telling her. They took it back and cleared it off the check. Over all, this was the woorst birthday meal in quit a while. So, blaEah, I wont be back for another decade.",

I ordered a drink and it arrived quickly but the bartender kept disappearing.   I had a question about the menu and had to wait over 10 minutes for her to come back.  I ordered and she brought my salad fairly quickly but then disappeared again.  She didn't come back until I was finished.  I don't blame the bartender because she seemed to be very busy with other work.  Management needs to schedule a bartender during the day that can actually tend to the bar customers and not have to be doing other duties in the kitchen.  Or, and here's a novel idea, managers need to help out instead of having the bartender do two or three other things.   I didn't see a manager while I was there.",

We ordered and once we saw other people getting their food first we started to wonder. I have patience but my company grew mad. I had a sirloin with veggies and he had chicken tacos. The manager came over and said she was sorry but the chef messed up a taco and that was causing the delay. She left and came back a few mins later and said not to worry about the meal as its going to be comped. Again, I wasn't mad or even bothered, things happen. Unfortunately, my company was. Okay, so on to the food. My steak was cooked to perfection. Tasted delicious. The veggies tasted fresh and the house salad was good. I enjoyed my meal. My company enjoyed the tacos once he got them. I think the only REAL negative complain I have was the air condition being on Arctic. Lol! Still a good experience minus the couple of mishaps.",

Our server was from Greenville and he was a total genuine host to us. Just loved his job and loved helping us. Kind, generous, (gave us extra bread). Thennnnn, our food was delayed (30 minutes). Didn't feel long because server checked up on us, but then the manager came and told us they had cooked the steak too much so they put a new one on and offered to reduce our bill. What excellent excellent service from the server to the manager. Impressed mostly from the service and equally with a delicious, medium sirloin, mashed potatoes and crisp broccoli, but most importantly an unforgettable experience. Seriously, won't forget this one.

The three of us got there around 11:30, service was good and everything was clean.  This time around I decided to try the double burger and fries, the burger was good but from seeing my coworker's bacon cheeseburger  it looked like they just cut a single patty in half to make the double.  I would probably recommend sticking to the steaks and if you want a burger go to Stone Mountain Grill.  I wouldn't wait to eat here but during the week when there's no line it's not that bad, only downside is trying to fight traffic to get back on the road.",

So far there has been a long wait for a waiter/waitress to come around for drink orders.  After receiving our appetizer 10 minutes ago, we're still waiting for silverware to be able to eat it.  We've been told that they are currently rolling the silverware in napkins and we will have silverware soon.  Still waiting!  The food is great but the service at this location couldn't be worse.",

When we walked in and noticed the chaos we knew what we were getting into and decided to proceed with requesting a table. The manager who was working the hostess station never raised her head to even acknowledge us.  Then it was an issue to sit us an a booth for two in a section where there three booths open and cleaned begind her. Mind you there was no wait...we were sat. My partner and I were seated, then the server who was to \"pick up\" our table (I guess we were in an open/floating section) made a scene that she got sat again(us).  The bathroom was more gross than any highway truck stop bathroom I've ever visited. The floor was soaked with urine. If that's what the bathroom looks like just imagine the kitchen.  This location was seriously understaffed and it appears their manager made a poor decision and made cuts too early this evening or too many people called out...  I couldn't figure out why the manager was working the hottest station when a hostess was actively working.  We will never go back.",

    "text": "(6/25/16)  My wife  wanted a steak for dinner  this  evening, never  mind  that  it's only  1600. So racking  my brain  for suitable  locations  I remembered  Outback on Hwy 51. There was a lot  of  parking  and we were seated  quickly  in the bar area. She had a sweet tea and I chose  lemonade. Bring reading glasses! The print on  the  menu  is  tiny and the lights are dim.   So in looking  at  the  menu I decided  to  order a loaded blooming  onion. It has cheese  fries added to it. It's supposed  to  be  the best of both but seemed average at best. The blooming  onion  is generally  a  tasty appetizer  that two people  can never fully finish. I think that the onion was smaller  to accommodate  the  cheese  fries. So taste-wise  it was greasy and under seasoned  though there were dipping  sauces available.  My wife ordered a 12oz  sirloin medium and I ordered the jumbo crab cake stuffed lobster tail. I am hoping for redemption. I probably  had a better  chance  of  winning  the  powerball. The crab was perfectly  seasoned  and the lobster  had been drizzled  with some sort of garlic  butter salt. Drizzled  is how it was supposed  to  be  done but drenched  was how it arrived at the table. I love lobster but not when it tastes like a salt lick for deer. What a shame! I had two managers visit our table. The first one asked how everything was. I could've said yellow for all she cared. The second one wanted to know how the lobster was and I told her that it was very salty. I told her that the cook probably put too much garlic salt in the butter sauce. I then told her that most of the people that ordered this dish wouldn't notice. I stopped before telling her that my palate was a bit more refined. The waiter told me that the lobster tails were 7oz but they sure looked like 4oz ones to me. I guess we'll wait another two years before seeing if the food has improved.",

It's the little things, like keeping soft drinks topped off?  It's the silly things like the Management leaving the to-go wait staff to \"fall on their sword\" with lame excuses rather than reasons for a Corporate app that makes food side offerings (green beans) available that are NOT available at Pineville? Obviously, something easily fixed if someone cared.   It's the BIG things like to-go orders being incomplete?  It's the BIGGER thing, a steakhouse that can't cook a steak to your requested doneness?  And probably the BIGGEST thing, GM \"C\" who may need to go back to a food service environment that tolerates her mediocrity?   At the end of the day, a generally solid restaurant choice but continued miscues may cause you to take your hard earned dollars elsewhere.",

Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.  My wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.  Only negative was the bread they served. It was a very dark bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.  My Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.  Service was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.  Atmosphere --- What can I say?  Typical Outback.  If you're in the Carolina Place Mall Area, this is a nice spot for Dinner and now Lunch",

Against my better judgment, I called again, waited on hold for 4 minutes, and then placed my order. They told me it would take 10 minutes. I got there 10 minutes later and waited in my car for another 10. The man next to me said he'd been waiting for 25 minutes!!!! An employee had been in and out of the building a few times and no one had helped him. I went inside the restaurant and everyone that I approached said they would help me in a minute.... no one asked me what I needed or what they could do for me. It was not busy in the restaurant at all - 1pm on a Saturday. I checked to make sure I had all the food I ordered and left. When I got home, I found out that none of the sauce we'd ordered was in the bag and the Aussie fries had no bacon on them... I like the food at Outback but this experience was very disappointing... 10 minutes just to place an order and another 40 to find someone and actually get my food.....",

One was the bone-in rib-eye and the other was their chicken quesadilla appetizer. Both came out fresh from the kitchen and were very tasty. I think other restaurants should take a note and if there's a long wait, give the guest something to munch on! It also helps make the wait for a table not seem as long!   Once we were seated, our waiter was prompt and attentive despite the fact that it was super busy that night. He kept the bread coming and our glasses full!   For the meal, I went with the Blue Cheese Wedge salad, Victoria's Filet and a loaded baked potato.   The Blue Cheese wedge salad was okay. I really like the balsamic reduction that add which gives it a really good flavor mixed with the blue cheese. My problem was the lettuce, it wasn't crisp and there were some brown pieces. The filet made up for the miss with the salad. It was cooked as requested and it was indeed a very tender. I may make this my go-to item when I return. The potato was classic.   All in all, we had a good meal with good service. And you really just can't ask for much more!",

We were seated too quickly I think, because he seemed a tad unprepared. But he quickly recovered and brought us our drinks after a brief disappearance.   This spot was our older son's choice for his birthday dinner. He really wanted the blooming onion. Being over 30 and the way my digestive system is set up, I knew to stay away. So our two sons engulfed it on their own.   Our food arrived quickly. Ribs for me and hubby. We were disappointed by the size of what was called a \"full slab\". It was more like 3/4 of a slab. But they tasted really good. Our older son also had the ribs and was pleased. Our younger son had the kiddie burger which was a rather decent size. He scored better than we did regarding portions.   Two bites into dinner and both boys complained of stomach pains. So much so that I had to leave with the younger one. We didn't make it home! Thank God I work for CHS and this spot is close to CMC-Pineville. We had to make a pit stop there for him to...well.. you know. And we DON'T use public restrooms like that so this was MAJOR!  The blooming onion basically went through the boys. Never again will we order one. Too greasy. You know how that still small voice tells you to stay away but you still do it? That's how we feel about the greasy, I mean blooming onion.   So I will give this spot a 3. Our service was good. Hubby and I enjoyed our food...although mine was enjoyed after getting everyone home and settled. Just think twice about the blooming onion. Free isn't always good!",

    "text": "Worst meal- EVER! My wife and I went to this Outback to celebrate my 62nd birthday on February 15th. I've enjoyed many great steak dinners for my birthday over the years, but this was hands down the worst birthday meal I have ever \"eaten.\" We started with a Bloomin' Onion for an appetizer and about a third of the onion was undercooked. I ordered a lobster tail and 6 oz filet cooked medium rare. The lobster tail was edible, but the filet was disgusting. It was so far left of rare that it looked purple. When I asked to speak to the manager she came to the table and did not seem surprised by the uncooked nature of the filet. She offered me a newly cooked filet, but when it came out 15 minutes later it was even more rare than the first one! I asked to see the proprietor and when she came to the table her response to my concern about the exceedingly rare meat made me feel like I was speaking a foreign language. When I asked her if she thought the meat was rare she gave me a vacant look like she did not understand why I was upset. Do yourself a favor, NEVER eat at Outback!",

The mashed potatoes were really creamy. I've had this same dish two days ago at an Outback in a different city as we are traveling and they were completely different and way better! She over charged us and said she even asked her manager and that was correct. When I asked to see the menu again she got a manager over and obviously I was right. Not only the waitress had got our order wrong but she wanted us to pay for it.  We are definitely not coming here again! Awful experience!",

But they could do the Ribeye. I that was ok. I ordered the steak \"rare\". Knowing it would probably come out a medium.  It was about 35 min later when the food came out. I checked my steak being a chef myself I could tell the steak was not rare. I cut in the middle to find out it was cooked to medium well. I put in a complaint and was told they cook cook another one.  But I told them it was ok, because I'm super hungry at this point and was not about to wait another 40 minutes to get another over cook steak. The server told the manager and he told me the same thing , that they could cook me another steak. I told him no thanks being I was half way thru eating my dinner at this point. The manager told me that he could comp me a free dessert. I am not a dessert eater. And I was in the impression that if I said no thanks to the dessert  I would receive some kind of % off my meal. But I guess they are cheap about giving discount for their mistake. When I heard that I got more upset then I already was. They need to learn a few things about having their guest leave happy when their order did not come to the table right the first time. There is a saying in Japan that \"if sorry was all you had to say we wouldn't need police \".",

A souffle cup with a lid that did not fit and I made a mess trying to force it on... she comes back and I ask her to bring me out some more...she brings it out and puts in my bag... today when I went to heat and eat my leftovers the sauce is completely wrong!!! You can't eat crab cakes without the sauce... I'm DONE!!!   Outback is one of the most inconsistent food chains ever. Today's experience proves just that! It is a cold 38 degree, rainy evening and they have the air on full blast! Our server who fulfilled my expectations informed management of our concern, who in turn relayed that he would need to call someone in Florida to get the temperature adjusted... R I D I C U L O U S!!! So when they finally bring my order, which was wrong, it was as cold as the air blowing on my back!!! This made for a very unpleasant dining experience and I definitely won't be visiting this location ( or any other if this a corporate situation) again through these winter months!  Disappointing!",

There was about a 15-20 min wait with that considered but we arrived around 8pm and there were still several families outside waiting for tables. I'll take a 15-20 min wait on a weekend, that's honestly, nothing.  Once we were seating our server, Ben, greeted us in a very timely manner. He was attentive, polite, and amiable. A great server experience and he earned a great tip. The best part about his hospitality is that this didn't seem like a job. Ben genuinely looked interested and showed real passion for his service. That's hard to find these days.  The food was on point. I had a Caesar Salad, grilled chicken with a baked sweet potato and of course, the amazing bread. My boyfriend enjoyed a 6oz filet with a sweet potato and cheese broccoli. We were both incredibly pleased. He ordered the filet rare expecting it to be cooked a bit longer and it was definitely a lovely medium rare to rare. No blood but it was seconds past that point. He also made a note about the cheese broccoli. I'm not big on most cheeses but he was very happy with his selection. My chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy. The BBQ sauce had a bit of a spicy aftertaste to it but I tend to be sensitive to even the slightest spice. Normal palates would probably hardly notice.  Ben brought our check and mentioned a survey and free bloomin' onion coupon for completing the survey in house. Not a bad deal, really. I filled out the survey and the manager came over to thank us for choosing to dine with them and shared the coupon for completing the survey. A nice personal touch.",

When we saw the promo for the steak & unlimited shrimp special, we had visions of those loaded cheese fries & that delightful warm bread...... fast forward to our visit this evening. The wait for everything was crazy - we sat quickly but our waiter was clearly backed up. It took 15-20 mins for our drinks to arrive -  He was plenty nice and he was busting his tail, but the food order took at least another 40 minutes. When our food came - it was not even close to being hot. I take that back, my green beans (suggestion from the waiter) were HOT and quite tasty. My fried shrimp was uber greasy (not strained at all) and ice cold. The meat was all room temp at best - I don't often expect piping hot at these types of restaurants, but it was notably cold since we were sat within view of the kitchen. I actually ordered chicken that had the worst consistency I've ever experienced. It was elastic and grainy (I have no other words to describe it and it looked like it was going to be SO good). The waiter was attentive when he returned and he was apologetic, but it wasn't his fault. He offered to have them cook a new one but honestly my stomach was turned by that point. More shrimp took forever (my family was done with their meals). The final shrimp (lemon garlic) was by far the best (and the hottest). Go figure. They were kind about the error and the manager tried to buy us a dessert but it'd have been wasted. We know we won't be back for probably another 10 years.  honestly it's a disappointment because we went in earlier than the normal dinner rush hoping we'd avoid any backups or lack of quality. Sadly, we were wrong. It's just not our kind of joint anymore. The positive? The mini really enjoyed his chicken fingers and said the barbecue sauce was the best he'd ever tasted!",

I've been to so many restaurants, especially franchises, where the hostess seems annoyed and bothered and unwilling to help and the servers just seem like they want to get out of there as quickly as possible. The folks at this location seem genuinely kind and friendly. Once we were there and the restaurant had a very very long wait, and multiple people, I think maybe bussers and other servers, offered us chairs and water and did the most that they could to help us feel comfortable while we waited. I was really impressed with that. No one asked them to do so, and I can't recall ever being at a restaurant and multiple people going out of their way to try to make you feel comfortable like that.",

Maybe the carry out containers need to be replaced with something that would work better? Ordered cheese fries with extra ranch. No extra ranch and no bacon! Both prime rib dinners came without horseradish sauce. Whoever expos the carryout food needs to do a way better job. With all of the restaurants around, no need to visit this one again.",

It took a little bit for the bartender TJ to speak to us even though we sat right in front of him, and he didn't make eye contact with either of us the entire time. We watched bare hands touching fruits to go in our cocktails, the bartender's personal beverage sitting on the counter beside customer beverages, fruit being sat on bare surfaces, my cup was sticky all over, etc. Luckily, the food was delivered in good timing & tasted delicious as always. But we've never had worse service or felt more dirty in this restaurant before.",

I was extremely disappointed with the quality of meat.  Even after soaking in au jus, the meat had the consistency of a piece of rubber with no taste.  Also they changed the bread recipe for the worse.  I shared a shrimp in cheese appetizer that was also disappointing.  Sad when the high-light of the meal was the salad. Still charged full price even though my dog was the recipient of half of the beef. Do not plan a return visit.",

They bring out complimentary bread and take your order. We didn't get any complimentary bread this trip until halfway through our meal when we asked for it. I ordered the filet with bottomless shrimp. You had the choice of garlic butter and shrimp or fried shrimp. I tried a little bit of both and the fried shrimp were nothing special tasted like frozen shrimp. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare. Don't understand when they got so stingy with their A1 sauce but I'm sure it's restaurant policy. Our server frequently forgot us even though when he was around he was extremely friendly.

I was tipsy off of one drink and my waitress was cute, funny and uber knowledgeable.

One thing I love is the call ahead seating or reserving a spot online. Every time I've used it we're seated right away and earlier than the time we said we would be there. And these times have been during a busy Saturday night.  Service is great at this location. Drinks and our appetizer came out quickly. The appetizer actually came out the same time as the complimentary bread. We were close to the kitchen, so managers and other servers constantly would help out if they saw we needed a refill. Our dinner was timed perfectly and it came out soon after we were done with our appetizer.   The food is pretty good. I love the bloomin' onion, but my husband doesn't. So we go for the sampler which includes onion, loaded fries and fried Mac and cheese. It is pretty greasy and I always feel guilty eating it. The onion pieces didn't disappoint and the dipping sauce is amazing. Fries were pretty standard and the Mac and cheese bites I didn't care for. They just seemed like cheese nuggets and I couldn't tell where the macaroni was.   For my entree, I got the Queensland shrimp and chicken pasta.  It was good, but very similar to dishes in other restaurants. The shrimp was plump and I liked it was grilled. The chicken was juicy but a little underseasoned. The pasta was good and the alfredo sauce was great. It didn't seem overly buttery or cheesy. And it had a kick of spice which I enjoyed. The husband ordered a porterhouse which he devoured so I guess he liked it.",

    "text": "I went here as a last resort after being unable to secure a table at Beef-n-Bottle, so my expectations in regards to meat quality that day were a little high.  The first thing to expect at Outback is a fairly long wait on weekends; if memory serves me correctly, the wait on a Saturday night was about 50 mins.  There is a small waiting area to the left of the door that has complimentary lemonade and they also pass out samples of appetizers.  This small space is a real life saver when it's really cold outside.  Regarding the food, I recommend either the Victoria Filet or the New York strip (rare or medium rare).  Since the prices are so reasonable, you're basically looking at a $10-14 steak if you get the sirloin and based on the comments from the table next to us, a $10 piece of meat is what you're gonna get.  While we enjoyed our filet and New York strip, the couple next to us was unable to finish more than half of their sirloins.  They said that the meat was kind of tough and dry.  I personally found my strip to be tender and juicy, however it was lacking in the seasoning department, let just say I needed a lot of steak sauce.  The loaded baked potato was cooked well, but the cesar salad that I had was very bland.  The dressing had almost no taste and the parmesan cheese was bland with an odd peppery taste.  The service was great, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  If you asked me if I'd return, I'd probably say no.  The food quality just isn't what I'm used to in the realm of steaks.  To be honest, I've had better steaks at some of Charlotte's local bars.  If you're on a limited budget and want a steak dinner for $20 or less, you can't beat the pricing here.",

    "text": "We went here for dinner one night early on a Saturday evening.  When we arrived at the restaurant it wasn't too busy and they were very efficient at seating us.  We ordered our drinks and looked over the menu --which left me with a couple of questions about one of their salads.  When the waiter returned he asked if we were ready.  So I asked my question: \"Can you tell me what comes on this salad?\" --the menu wasn't overly descriptive.  His response was: \"Erm, well, it's a salad, and it comes with steak!\" --good job genius, that's what a \"Steak Salad\" typically comes with.  Any way, so I order this 'Steak Salad'; I can be quite daring sometimes.  The food was served quite prompt --as I could see why when I received the salad.  This \"Steak Salad' was an iceberg lettuce, cut in two --they put one half on the plate, uncut --like, just a chunk of lettuce, with some dingy looking piece of meat which looked like it was from a 130 year old cow.  Though I will say the steak was halfway tasty, it really didn't look too appetizing, especially stuck next to a green rock of lettuce.  When the genius waiter said  \"Erm, well, it's a salad, and it comes with steak!\", I guess he wasn't screwing around --it really was just steak and salad.  The restaurant itself was somewhat dirty in appearance and everything, including the table, felt a bit grimy.  I will say it looked nice from the outside, however, though that doesn't mean much if the place is a hole on the inside.  The overall experience at this place was just all right --nothing special at all.  I would eat here again, but only if it was the only place left in Charlotte that had power and food.",

If you go in and there is a long wait, it is good to remember that the bar is first come, first serve.  I never wait longer than 5 minutes because I typically get a seat in the bar area.

I stopped into outback for dinner because of the Outback Bowl deal - free bloomin' onion with any purchase!  Yes.  Yes, please.  Because it was just me, I didn't call ahead or anything - but hoped for a spot in the bar/seat yourself section.  This place was packed full of people.  And they were like sharks over those booths, so I sat myself at the corner of the bar.  Mandy, the bartender, was very nice - and she didn't give me that \"oh, it's just you? Eating alone? Forever alone?\" look.  Thank you, Mandy.    I ordered the outback bowl onion and a Caesar salad with shrimp.  I heard Mandy tell one of the other servers that the bloomin' onions were being picked up left and right in the kitchen, regardless of ticket.  It seemed like Outback was having some trouble with the demand.  Mandy actually flagged down a server with an onion and told her to give it to me.  I really appreciated that!  Sometimes I get skipped or forgotten about when I'm eating out on my own.  Not this time!  Basically, everything was delicious.  Onion was crispy and hot, shrimp Caesar salad was perfect.  I took a to-go box for my onion, and forgot it when I left (like I usually do).  Mandy chased me out the door, onion in hand and asked if I still wanted it!  I know that she was crazy busy in there, taking time like that is impressive!  I'll definitely be back, probably sitting in the shark infested bar section.",

When I said something to the server who ran the food to the table, she said, do you want us to cook a new one? When I said no, I figured a manager would be sent to the table, as we would have done back in my day. No one ever revisited the table until their FOH manager did her standard rounds from table-to-table and I opened up about it. It was at this time that she recognized I had not eaten any of it and offered to take it off the bill. While she was at the computer completing the void of my dinner from the bill, I noticed our server approach the manager and do a couple of sideways glances with a mild scorn on her face in our direction. I will always be an OSI customer, but I may not visit this location again.",

After we placed our drink order she brought us our bread while we decided on an appetizer. We decided on the grilled shrimp and after about 5 minutes it came to our table. The presentation wasn't something to call home about but the shrimp were excellent and the dipping sauce definitely added to the flavor.   My husband got the house salad with blue cheese and he said it was good. He finished it so I guess I'll have to take his word for it.   I think we might have waited 20 minutes total for our food to get out. I got the Outback Special with a baked potato, and my husband got the cheddar bacon burger.

    "text": "I used to really like Outback in NJ but I'm in NC now. I ordered 18.99 10oz ribeye medium. Haven't they figured out how to cook a steak by now? It was dry and well done plus it was small for the price.  My dad ordered a sirloin and it was so well done it was difficult to cut. I am afraid to send food back to the kitchen ever see the movie Waiting? I denied the managers offer to send it back. Disappointing. Will never return. Sad too I used to love Outback. I guess the CEO who makes a million dollars would rather put it in his pocket than pay for a decent chef. It's a real shame.",

The seared ahi tuna and beef nachos (on freshmade chips!) were the highlight of the evening.  The main variation is always the server - sometimes they are terrific and other times they are forgetful and rude. The management at this location is quick to head off problems though!",

    "text": "I had a very bad experience with this location and with the managers and the owner of this outback. They say they care about there customers but in fact done care at all. We ate in this outback on a Saturday evening, first the bathrooms were trashed with puddles of urine on the floor and paper towels overflowing as well. Alerted the manager just to let them know. Our server was not attentive at all we could hardly find him and had to ask other servers for help. At one point the manager told us she would give us a discount on the check for the issues we were having. Well when the check came there was no discount at all. At this point we just wanted to get out of there. If you are going to offer something to customers and they don't even ask then they should follow thru. I emailed the managing partner who responded to me that she wanted to talk with me on Monday and also wanted us to come back and be her guest. She told me to call her between certain time at the restaurant. Well I was not able to call her and sent an email stating that and asked for a time u could. Well I never heard back from her. I have sent a few emails and still nothing. They claim they care about there customers but obviously they don't",
