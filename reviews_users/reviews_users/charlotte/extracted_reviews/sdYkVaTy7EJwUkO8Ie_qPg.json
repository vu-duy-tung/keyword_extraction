They have a many vegetarian options, but you can also add chicken or steak to them. Two of my favorites are The Great sandwich with provolone and bacon, and the Peruvian fried rice with chicken. They have fried yucca which is amazing, if you haven't had it before, get it. And I know it seems weird to mention, but this place has really good French fries. Go, try it, you won't be disappointed.",

Being an Elizabeth resident, I obviously knew this place was here, but I was kind of thinking \"eh, how great could chicken be?\" VERY GREAT, APPARENTLY.  I got a quarter chicken, white meat, with cilantro rice and plantains. Of course, I had heard all about the yellow sauce and had to try it. I intended to try the other two sauces but I ate so fast I didn't have time. Oh well, guess I'll have to go back! My food was AMAZING, I loved every bit of it. The staff was so friendly, asking me if I needed anything and clearing tables and restocking supplies. I messaged my friends to let them know I had finally tried it, and my message said \"I think I'm just going to keep ordering food and live here forever.\" I have a feeling that living there is against the health code, but they can't stop me from coming back until I try everything on the menu!",

The three sauces make just about anything delicious and we like to grab extra to take home. Our favorite it the verde sauce which is the \"medium\" choice between yellow and red. My go-to the taco bowl without chicken. Despite the name, I am very happy with the numerous vegetarian options. My husband loves the Inca wrap with a side salad. We have also enjoyed several of the entree salads and the sweet plantains are just perfect. This spot is great for everyone, solo diners grabbing a quick weekday lunch, families, or couples on a date. You can't go wrong with anything topped with the sauce, and adding a quinoa stuffed avocado to your meal is never a bad idea.",

Decent portions, nice plating, everything was hot. Not nearly enough seating at the Elizabeth location.  We felt rushed once we were close to being done, almost hovered over.    If I happened to be in the neighborhood, I'd likely try other joints out first.  If I were invited for business, I wouldn't object, it just would not be a \"have to go\".",

She was a young African American, and I believe she had glasses on.  When she brought our food out she didn't bring it all out at once, & when I asked for the silverware she told me I had to go get it inside the restaurant. I looked confused because I had never received an attitude from any of the employees. The Hispanic waitress must have heard the young lady direct me to go inside to get my fork. So the Hispanic woman instead quickly went inside the restaurant and brought out napkins and silverware out to our table.",

Our food came out quickly too!  I got a rice dish that had egg, chicken, and ginger in it. I could have used more of the sauce they cooked my dish in as the chicken was actually a bit dry, but still tasty. My husband got a different dish with cilantro rice, chicken and beans with pickled onions and avocado, it was good! They have a really tight set-up, as in not a lot of room. Their house made sauce station (killer sauces!) is squeezed in next to their drink machine in the corner so there is a line that backs up and blocks the main walking area, not a good idea. I would definitely go back.",

They are almost always busy, but they get the food out very quickly, which I very much appreciate. The wraps are great, and they can sub ingredients no problem. I appreciate they always get it right too, which sometimes lacks with quick food. The salads are my favorite-awesome, healthy ingredients. Thanks Viva!",

    "text": "So let me give you the insight on Viva Chicken.. Although it is obvious that they specialize in chicken, as it is in the name, it is also a great place for vegetarians to indulge in!!  In my pre-pescatarian days I would always get the half chicken that was cooked to perfection!! Now that I have eliminated land meat from my diet, I have ventured to other items on the menu that is just as good! The Naked Peruvian is a wrap that I enjoy grabbing for is I want something quick for lunch. I get it without the cheese easy on their special mayo and some of the green sauce to drip it into. It's filling, and simply delicious!  Now onto my FAV non-meat item on the menu.. The Arroz Chaufa w/ a side of green beans that I mix into the rice and top with the spicy red sauce!! OMG it is soooo good!!! I order this at least once of week for takeout. You can request it without the egg for a super tasty vegan dish. The portion is plenty and the container they serve it in when you order to go is super handy to hold onto and keep. Wash everything down with their herbal lemonade and you will not be disappointed!!  I simply love everything about Viva Chicken, from their quality food and friendly customer service. If you are living in Charlotte and have not eaten here.. Your Missing Out!!",

    "text": "I don't give my highest honors out recklessly. Viva chicken in my experience consistently delivers poultry (almost) perfection. The location in the heart of the trendy Elizabeth neighborhood is my personal favorite.   The interior is understated, with lots of tans, Brown's and wood, and muted oranges. Large front of house windows provide plenty of natural light, affording in the light casual atmosphere. The whole ambience says, \"we let our chicken do the talking for us\".  Bonus points for the approximately 458 outlets dotted along the indie dining room. They clearly recognize their proximity to the CPCC campus. Plus the convenience of the outlets is a God-send for Yelp reviewers who burned up their battery playing Pokemon Go, erm, not that I'd know anything about that...  My go to order is the half chicken with 2 sides. I can vouch for the yuca fries and the quinoa from my pre-low-carb life. I can also vouch for their arroz con pollo dish. The green beans are also bae.  Bonus for any Pokemon Go players: there is a Poke stop literally right outside the entrance! Pick a table near front of house if you're dining in, drop a lure, and catch 'em all while you eat!",

The food was great, and the cashiers were friendly. The setup needs a little work. We went at prime dinner time and almost the whole time we were there someone was filling up tea jugs (for catering orders I assume) so it was hard for anyone to get to the sauces and drinks which are all shoved into a tiny corner. Speaking of sauces-- mmm the green one. This would be a great option for togo food, they even have a seperate line for pickup orders.",

I'm looking forward to trying the quinoa stuffed avocados sometime, the Yelp pictures make it look amazing! We ordered the arroz chufa with a side chicken and rice soup and The Great sandwich with all white meat (its $2 to add chicken and 75 cents to add only white meat), they gave us a 20 minute wait. It was packed when we went in for pick up but thats ok, that means the food is good. I was surprised by the size and weight of the takeout containers, pretty big actually. The arroz chufa is a Asian Peruvian fusion fried rice, and it was delicious. I loved the addition of bell peppers and Peruvian soy sauce. This is definitely enough to share too. The Great was also an amazing sandwich, fresh and substantial. You can definitely order just the sandwich for lunch and be satisfied. Though not authentic, I love the ciabatta bread that was used. They used a generous amount of chicken as well. The side soup was great! Had big, flavorful chunks of chicken.   But my favorite part, has to be the sauce bar! My favorite, the green sauce! I can put that sh*t on everything! The cilantro and jalapeno really shine here. I actually think its more spicy compared to the hot red sauce. YUM. Will for sure be back for more!",

Order at the register and pay, get your drink filled and then your food's brought to you a bit later.  I chose \"The Great\" sandwich - a good portion of pulled chicken with the usual lettuce and tomato on a toasted ciabatta roll. It was excellent. The chicken was nice and moist with a good flavor.

They have special house made sauces to spice up your meal if you'd like too. All very tasty! For the most part everything is very inexpensive, and worth the price! Would strongly recommend. Vegetarian options as well!",

I really enjoy their juices too.  They can be a little heavy so I would say make sure you eat enough of your food first so you won't get full off of the juice. The prices are decent too. I don't have a huge appetite so I'm always able to have leftovers from the Tacu Bowl.  I actually just saw the other day while driving they are opening another location near Concord Mills so that is exciting. Go grab a bite..you won't be disappointed!",

I wanted to branch out and try plantains although I must say they weren't my favorite. The rice, however, was yummy!  Service: Customer service there was equally as enjoyable. I liked how the owner came out to check on our meals and ask us how everything was.   Atmosphere: Mid-century modern style with an emphasis on recycling which was a plus. Their outdoor seating is very lovely as well.  I will definitely be coming back to this place to try out more of their menu!",

I thought that a place with \"Chicken\" in the name would have paltry fare for a vegetarian like me. Boy was I wrong. I've had the amazing Quinoa Stuffed Avocado that is surprisingly filling and flavorful. I don't regret trying it, but it didn't send me down this path.  My heart belongs to the Tacu Bowl. Now, Chipotle, I know you're trying really hard, but your vegetarian burrito bowl doesn't hold a candle to the Tacu Bowl at Viva Chicken. And that's why I'm calling it off.  The Tacu Bowl has perfectly executed rice, flavorful beans, a generous smattering of cilantro, and some amazing onion/tomato mixture to top it off that leaves my mouth watering more after every bite. Add a little of the Huacatay Sauce and there's almost nothing better in the world.  Speaking of reasons why my affections have shifted...the fried yucca. Oh so amazing. And I've eaten my share of uninspiring fried yucca. This yucca makes all my dreams come True. Dipped in the Aji Amarillo Sauce and Huacatay Sauce, it changed my life and expectations of food.  I know it's not fair to compare you two, and I hate to tell you in this way...but I'm moving in with Viva Chicken. Tomorrow.  We can still be friends, right?",

Not only is the chicken moist and flavorful, they have some great sauces to go with it.  I've had both their mild and medium, and they were both pretty fabulous (that medium packs quite a heat!).  All in all, it is rather reasonably priced.  If you dine in, you can get a quarter quicken and two sides for around $8.  Last time I got a whole chicken and three sides for $18.95.   My partner and I had plenty of leftovers the next day.  As far as the sides go, I've had their beans, yucca, and plantains.  My partner really enjoyed the beans and I thought they had a good flavor.  They have just a touch of sweetness to them.  Their yucca is seriously the best I've ever had.  They texture is much lighter than other ones I've had, so it did not taste too starchy.  Finally, their plantains have a great level of sweetness to them.  If you dine in, you can also order their sangria.  It was quite different than others I've had, but still very good.  I could swear I tasted a little tequila in it.    Oh crap...now I'm hungry for their chicken!  Viva \"Viva Chicken\"!",

I ordered the 1/2 rotisserie, which was amazing and put the orange sauce on my rice. My mom ordered the stuff avocado, which she finished in minutes. And my 7yr old daughter loved the rice.

    "text": "Holy crap, dude. Viva Chicken is the hero Charlotte needs and deserves. Is it possible to get cheap, ethnically accurate lunch with fresh, healthy ingredients prepared with a modern twist right here in the Queen City? Say it with me: \"Si, se puede!\"  I went ahead and got a quarter chicken lunch with plantains and salad, even though the quinoa-stuffed avocado was gently whispering, \"Aubreyyyyy...\" in my ear. The Peruvian chicken is seasoned with just the right blend of South American spices to give it that extra succulent edge, but without overpowering the comforting taste of chicken we all know and love. Plantains are a winner every day. Dat salad doe...the dressing they put on it was INCREDIBLE. I won't go into great detail to describe it; I'll only say that you have to try it to believe it.  Based on all of the above, I would give Viva Chicken a five star review. But they get extra bonus points for having alfajores (more common to Argentina than Peru, but I won't tell anyone..... except you), having a chic, modern interior, and for playing a trendy mix of loungy club music that would put almost all the shittacular clubs in Uptown to shame. I mean, epic shame, dude. Most of those clubs fucking suck.  So, let's see: five stars for food, extra stars for alfajores, ambiance, and music, plus a few more because I'm feeling generous this morning...  12 stars...?",

I yelp another restaurant and came across this one and I'm so glad i did.   This place wasn't busy and I'm surprised it wasn't. The chicken was so good. Super juicy and the meat fell right off the chicken legs. The white meat was also pretty juicy and not dry at all. We ordered the combo of $25 that came with the chicken, salad with avocado, sweet plantains, rice. OH, and their green sauce was delish! That is a super great deal i have to say. We didn't finish and packed the rest of the chicken home. While I was there I enjoyed a cheerwine that I Typically don't have access to living in Virginia Beach and while I was eating and the drink was almost empty a thoughtful employee by the name of Vadim came over and asked if I would allow him to refill my drink (WOW did that just happen?) and after I finished and was engaging my friend in some casual conversation another wonderful employee by the name of Yisenia had come over and requested permission to take away my plate that was obviously finished. I cant remember the last time I was in a fast food establishment that treated their customers so good! Next day, reheated the chicken in the oven and it still tasted so good. We ordered the corn and cheese for appetizer, which was something we weren't use to, and i didn't like so much.  Service was great, food was great, and loved the decor! I will come back for more!!!!!!",

I tried the Tacu Bowl with chicken and it was such a massive amount of food! Lasted for two meals. The chicken was so tender; and the rest of the dish added a ton of flavor that I didn't need any sauce on it. My boyfriend got the stuffed quinoa avocados with chicken and that was amazing. They looked awesome. The sweet plantains were perfectly cooked and there were plenty to share between the two of us. This is definitely a place we will come back to visit!",

I drive from Southpark frequently to get their fabulous roasted chicken and the amazing aji amarillo (yellow pepper) sauce that goes on everything - get one to dip sandwiches - SO GOOD.  Highly recommend: \"The Great\" pulled chicken sandwich with smoked pepper mayo - add avocado, very fresh crusty bread.  Don't miss the chicha morada - purple corn drink that cools your tongue after the spicy aji sauce.  Herbal lemonade equally delicious.  OH, the quinoa stuffed avocado is REALLY good, order with pulled chicken on top for an entree.  Service is always excellent and owners are friendly and welcoming.  Great patio.  Great for casual dates. Love!!",

I love Peruvian chicken places and our favorite is Pio Pio, so that is what we base our review from.  I ordered what I normally order at Pio Pio, a 1/2 chicken and a side, they didn't have my tostones,  :(  but they did have yuca and sweet plantains.  We also had the Chaufa with chicken.  The chicken was good, nothing to say I needed to have it again but  decent not what I expected,  thought it would be better after all the reviews raving about it.  The Chaufa was on the sweet side, didn't have the Peruvian taste I expected and besides picking out a few large bones it wasn't bad.  Once again I expected to be blown away by this place but just felt like an ordinary meal, nothing there we had would make me desire to return.   The yuca sticks were good as well as the sweet plantains.   The price also I thought was a little on the high side for what we had, even the area taken into consideration.   $22 for half chicken,  chaufa (fried rice with chicken).  For taste and price Pio Pio is much better in our opinion.",

Since I haven't had a bad experience yet, I decided my fiance should try it too! It's his bday weekend, so I told him it wasn't fancy, but it was good! Proud to say he enjoyed it as well! The location was pretty busy, but the staff was friendly and we got our food in good time.  I'm a creature of habit, so the only thing I have ever tried is the Arrroz Chaufa (with no red onions or red peppers) paired with a Dr. Pepper. My fiance said it looked bland (taking away the colorful veggies does that I guess! lol), but trust me... it is always very flavorful. Definitely give all of the sauces a try -- my favorite is the yellow sauce!  Not bad for the first meal of our trip!",

It was enough to fill us my husband and I up without being overly stuffed. The chicken was moist, the veggies and fries tasted fresh and the side dipping sauces, OMG!!! The fambam originally wanted The Habit down the street but they were SO glad we vetoed their decision. Everyone definitely enjoyed it!!! We will be back whenever we're back in that area!

Your getting Peruvian style food so it is relatively healthy with a good number of sides to choose from (hit the green beans and sweet potato fries quite a bit).   Pro tip: if it's your first time try each one of the sauces  (yellow, green, red). You won't know which sauce you want for your chicken and/or side till you've been a few times.

After going to Peru a few years ago, I've been jonesing for some seriously delicious Peruvian chicken and everywhere I turned, I was let down.   [[*Enters Viva Chicken*]]  We were looking for a quick fix, with flavor and a level of spice, so my friends suggested Viva Chicken. Knowing this was \"fast food\" I was seriously skeptical on how good this Peruvian style chicken would actually be. Much to my surprise, it was awesome!  My fiance and I split a plate because we had no idea what to order. We wound up with 1/4 chicken and two sides. Naturally one of the sides was yucca fries and the other was quinoa. Wow! I was blown away with the flavor, and I loved the additional sauces that you could opt for on the side. Be sure to get one of their spicy sauces because it will tempt those taste buds.   Since Peru, I've been craving the Chicha Morada. It's a sweet purple fruit juice made from purple corn. There is nothing like it. It's a refreshing flavor and Viva Chicken captures the sweetness. It's a little weird, but you have to try it.  I can't wait to come to make another stop here!",

    "text": "Last summer when I was here, I kept hearing about all of the hype at this place. My job ordered it in one day. And although it was good, I wasn't completely going crazy. BUT...this time, I was indeed! My mom was in town this weekend so I wanted to take her to a place True to Charlotte and I'm a cool area, so we went to the original location. At first we were overwhelmed by the amount of options. One of the employees behind the register realized and literally came around to point out each thing to us, explain each dish, talk about her favorites, and say all of the different options that we had. Just her enthusiasm for her job and the stuff that they make made us excited and ready to eat everything. My mom and I ended up sharing the stuffed avocado salad and then got a quarter chicken with two sides. One was this cold salad type dish with corn, edamame, and a few other things. My mom absolutely loved it! And then I chose to get yuka, which I only had one other time at a Cuban restaurant. We dipped that and the chicken in their mild sauce, which deserves a moment of silence, it was so good. I also tried one of their house made juices, which tasted just like Christmas. Everyone around us seemed to be eating the fried rice, so I definitely have to get that next time.",

Food is delicious like always. I'd never had Peruvian food but Viva Chicken made me fall in love with it. I love their taco bowl and quinoa stuffed avocado. The flavor and quality of food was amazing for a so-called fast food. Not to mention, I'm in love with their sauces as well!  4-stars because sometimes they put so much sauce on my quinoa stuffed avocado and the chicken in the wrap was dry. The price is reasonable for only some dishes.  I would definitely come back to try some of the other items on the menu.",

Though now that I've gone, I've got to get back and try the quinoa stuffed avocado or chicken plate with sides.  As a newbie, I stressed out at order time and just went with the viva chicken salad. It was still delicious but next time I'll branch out more. I was so impressed at how tender yet flavorful the pulled chicken was. Well done, viva, well done. The house dressing was fantastic, and is similar to a balsamic. In addition to the delicious house dressing, I also opted for some of the ajo amarillo (mild) sauce - I can see why it's a crowd favorite! The salad was pretty big, so you're getting your money's worth. Service was prompt, and each person I encountered was friendly.   FYI - they do have wireless in there as well, though I wouldn't recommend sitting in there to work during the busy lunch/dinner hours where table space is a necessity. Luckily, all Viva lovers in North Charlotte can be happy they also have a location next to Whole Foods Huntersville.",

They have traiditional appetizers such as a huacachina which was pretty on point.  Though, this isn't really a peruvian restaurant with traidtional peruvian plates.  Its more of a sandwich shop infused with Peruvian food.  At first, i was hoping for the latter, but after I took that first bite I knew this would be one of my favorite spots.  They do use pollo al a brasa ( rotisserie) and have lomo saltado, but basically this is just a banging sandwich place.  For the price this can't be beat. Great sandwiches, great taste, and inca cola mudda trucker.   Tip- always use the green aji sauce.  My god I wish someone would bottle this up and sell it like siracha.  I would buy a keg of it.",

Turns out my Inca wrap is cold, I got plantains instead of sweet potato fries and got 2 sauces I didn't order (ordered hot and the green sauce) and both sauce cups weren't even half full. Not sure I'll go back and definitely won't be visiting during lunch rush. Only positive is the sauce I got is actually good but I miss the green sauce. I can imagine the wrap is really good if its warm.  Edit: raising to 5 stars because I replied to my confirmation email about the mix up and they called immediately to resolve it. Lunch rush happens - might just stick with dinner next time.",

No one cooks rotisserie chicken like Peruvians do!  I was very impressed with the portion size and quality of the food. My half chicken with was cooked and seasoned perfectly with sides of fried yucca and green beans.  All were very good, but perhaps a little salty.  Make sure that you save room for dessert... Some of the best tres leches cake I have ever tasted!    And best of all, it is super cheap! I got a half chicken, two sides, a bottle of water, and a huge piece of tres leches cake for just about $20 with tax.  I like that the place was very casual, but there is not much ambience. We did sit outside in the covered area, but it was not super special.",

Options range from rice bowls and salads to quinoa-stuffed avocado with pulled chicken on top. It's all rich in flavor, and the chicken is so moist. There are 3 sauces you can put on your meal: mild, medium, and hot, and they are all delicious depending on your preference. My boyfriend's favorite is the Wow Lomito steak sandwich (though I can't stray from the chicken). My go-to is the Tacu Bowl, which is a rice bowl topped with fresh avocado, veggies, and a heaping pile of Peruvian pulled chicken.   Viva defines fast casual. The last 3 times that I've been, we order, walk to the drink machines and get our favorite sauces, and by the time we find a table, they are sitting our food down for us as we are sitting down ourselves. The timing has been flawless.   If you choose to go during lunch hour during the work week, be prepared for crowds and the noise level that comes with having many happy customers.",

I also got sides of all of their sauces because I had heard they were essential to the experience.  I don't know if it was them constantly telling me how good it was/going to be, or just my visit, but I was immensely disappointed. It was ok, but I would take normal asian fried rice over this any day. They were fast and the sauces definitely added a different flavor, but I wasn't over the moon with the Arroz Chaufa.

Between my girlfriend and I, we ordered the half chicken and the with green beans and chicken soup and the herbal lemonade. We then went to the sauce area to grab one of each of the sauces.Man, these sauces are A-mazing!! The chicken was cooked to perfection.  The sauces on it were a great combo. Next time, we are getting the full order! The green beans were nicely roasted. However, as crazy as it sounds, the winner of the night was the chicken soup.

My favorites are the Wow Lomito steak sandwich with extra mild sauce, the Viva Chicken salad (with mild sauce instead of balsamic), and the quinoa stuffed avocado with, you guessed it, more mild sauce.  You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches, which are served on soft chewy ciabatta bread.  Don't forget the mild sauce :)",

Our friends suggested we meet for dinner here before a show at the Visulite, and, not knowing a thing about Peruvian anything, I was a bit hesitant, hoping I'd find something I would know what it was. I took a chance on the Inca Wrap, with chicken added, and holy moley! It was so delicious. I got the Yucca as a side (not knowig what Yucca was either - yeah, sheltered life I suppose) and apparently the dipping sauce was supposed to be for the Yucca, but I thought it went on the wrap, which actually made it even more delicious. It was such a large wrap I only ate half and hubby got to have the other half for lunch the next day. He said even cold, it was amazing. I can not wait to go back! Only 4 stars right now until I try everything else. Friendly and quick service, too. Highly recommended, although I don't know why I'm sharing what should be my new \"secret\" go-to spot. Now there is another reason to go to shows at The Visulite Theatre!",

The line moves fairly quickly. I ordered my rotisserie chicken, side salad, and plantains to go. There were so many people waiting for their take-out, but no one seemed to mind. An employee began passing out free herbal tea lemonade to those of us waiting and apologized for the wait. It was green tea-y and delicious! I had to wait about 10 minutes, but i didn't mind. The food is well worth the wait and the extra attention to detail and lemonade was an added bonus! I'll be back soon, viva chicken!!",

The taste of the sauce was very slightly lacking in authenticity but I will attribute this to the location smack in the center of yup-ville. The employees didn't seem to care very much about..

The quarter chicken plate ($7.95, $5.95 for lunch!) is more than enough food for me. I love the sweet potato fries and salad. The feta cheese and sweet/tangy dressing make the salad.

Anyway, the decor is clean with warm dark colors.  The food arrived quickly. We also liked how you can see the cooks prepare. The beans looked like Northern beans, which was fine and tasted good. Not sure if they offer black beans, which we love. The cilantro rice is yummy with the added greens peas and carrots.  The chicken was moist, tender, and flavorful. My only problem was mine was red in some spots, which they quickly fixed. That happens in any place where they rotisserie the chicken. Plaintains were cooked perfectly. The prices were reasonable and moderate. We will be back for more.",

    "text": "I was picking up lunch on Elizabeth one day and accidentally spotted this place.  After reading all of the reviews I definitely had very high expectations (sometimes not a good thing).  However, this place did not disappoint at all.  I got the rotisserie chicken, plantains, and yucca.  The chicken literally falls off of the bone and is extremely tender and juicy.  It is also packed full of authentic flavor (I say that having been down there).  The plantains were amazing.  I could have had only those for my entire meal.  The yucca is rather bland, but that is how it is supposed to taste so it is cooked how it should be!  We also got the \"Famous Huancaina\" appetizer which is basically grilled potatoes with cheese sauce over the top.  Very nice appetizer to share.  The staff are all courteous, friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.  The atmosphere is inviting as well, especially the patio covered with flowers.    There were a couple of aspects of the experience that could have been improved upon.  The chicken portions are rather small, so if you are hungry get the half chicken not the quarter (I know, I know, the portion sizes are probably sufficient but this is 'Merica and we like our food portions huge).  The appetizer came out actually after our food came out, so that was a bit of a problem.  There were several of us there and we had nothing to do later so we wanted to more or less relax and not rush to eat.  If you want to sit and share a drink or two before dinner, do not order when you get your drinks, as the food comes out rather quickly (*note: This is not necessarily a bad thing if you are in a hurry, just something to keep in mind).  We sat at the corner table on the patio, directly under the speaker, and it was very loud.  Overall this is one of, if not my absolute, favorite chicken places that I have found in Charlotte.  Definitely recommend this to anyone. 4 1/2 stars.",

The chicken had great flavor and was oh so tender!   We sat outside on the super cute patio. The servers came out and refilled our drinks and were very attentive.

First off, I would just like to say the quality of their food is just perfection. I'm a very big fan of avocado and you can add avocado to any of your dishes for .75 cents. And perfectly ripen fresh cut avocados not the type of avocados that have been cut and mashed and left in the fridge for weeks.   Rotisserie chicken is what they are known for and it's amazing. I personally love the stuffed quinoa avocado with shredded chicken. Very filling and healthy.  \"The Great\" sandwich is obviously great as well. Finish everything off with the maracuya drink and that's a perfect lunch for you.",

Everything that they had is quickly put together on the spot. I had the tallarin saltado with beef and it was surprisingly good. Everyone seems to be enjoying their meal. The Peruvian rotisserie chicken is pretty good.    If you want a quick glimpse of what Peruvian food is with an American production twist, this is the place for you. Prices are a little high for my taste for an everyday lunch place.   Try the inca kola, it's what all Peruvians grow up with... The national soft drink.",

Instead of waiting in the long line, we decided to order our food through their app which came in handy.  The food was good but had a hard time giving it more than 3 stars.  I'd definitely go back but there are many other restaurants in Charlotte higher on my list.    I ordered the half chicken with 2 sides (cilantro infused rice, sweet plantains) and the Quinoa stuffed Advocado's.  The chicken was tender and went well with the two different sauces it came with.  The Quinoa stuffed Advocado was full of flavor and very unique - would definitely recommend ordering.  The sides were just OK.",

I would most definitely come here again the next time I visit Charlotte!",

Peruvian fast food who would have thought...  This place is packed at 4:30 on a Sunday. Families, college kids, old people, basically everyone was here.  definitely a cross section and diverse clientele..... great vibe.  The staff was very helpful and Jocelyn went out of her way to make some recommendations and also to walk me through the process.  The cashier recommended a sandwich, but I want fried rice, and also the 1/4 dark rotisserie chicken.  Eyewitness her recommendation for the green beans the plantanes, but when I sat down and was waiting for my food Jocelyn asked me if I had gotten the French fries. After trying the green means I probably should have gotten the fries.  The chicken was very tasty.  It's tender and has a very good seasoning. The plantain's were excellent, and perfectly cooked. But, the green beans were average at best, nothing special. As a matter of fact, trying them just before I left, they were better, so apparently they're better cold.",

The prices seemed a bit expensive.  I ordered the half chicken with solterito and cilantro infused rice.  The chicken was just ok... it reminded me of a grocery store rotisserie chicken. About the same flavor but maybe a bit more greasy.  The solterito was good and the feta cheese gave it great flavor.  The cilantro infused rice was bland but after adding one of the sauces it was much better.  meh.",

I tried the quarter chicken with cilantro rice and yuca. Nothing disappointed but everything is packed with flavor and a slight kick.

We stopped dining out or doing takeout, it's all been disappointing for the most part (and I'm talking about \"so called\" fabulous restaurants. We've heard about Viva Chicken many times, and all we could think about was \"what the heck could they do with chicken that I haven't already mastered?\" But I wasn't up for cooking. . .I'm from Manhattan, got married and ended up in Charlotte. So I suggested to my husband we finally order \"take out\" from them. Ordered the whole chicken with three sides. Chicken was cooked to perfection, the sides we ordered were the Peruvian rice, salad and chicken soup. Almost everything was SO DARN GOOD -- we dumped the chicken soup, it was nothing but heavily salted broth -- PLEASE don't make THAT mistake! Had we started with the soup we would have written off the rest of the food. VIVA, as a Manhattanite whose dined at some of the best restaurants in the world. . .please take that so called \"chicken soup\" off of your menu!!!",

Add to that obsession list- the fried rice. During my most recent visit, one of the workers brought me a sauce from the kitchen. Game changer. It's like a hoisin type and is absolutely delicious. Sadly, it was just a seasonal sauce they had for a salad. I'm a big fan of all the sauces here. They're all so different and tasty. The chicken is amazing. I don't think there's a wrong way to order here. The herbal limeade and passion fruit juices are made in house. Note: there's no free refills on those specialty drinks. So, show some restraint and don't chug your drink.   This place gets pretty busy, so I typically get my food to go. You can order online for pick up now. All the workers here are really nice. It's one of those places where you can't help but leave happy.",

Although I am aware that Charlotte is a major city and home to several global financial institutions, I still was not expecting to be so deeply enamored with a Peruvian restaurant in North Carolina.  Viva Chicken is somewhat of a local chain that serves up a fantastic pollo a la brasa (tender, moist, tasty, honest-to-goodness, rotisserie chicken rubbed with a mildly spicy seasoning). The arroz chaufa (China Peruana fried rice) with pulled pollo a la brasa is another hit. What takes all this deliciousness to the next level of awesomeness is the house made sauces. The roasted rocoto sauce is the spiciest but also packed with the most flavor. The aji amarillo is smooth and creamy with a slight kick. The huacatay is basically a blend of jalapenos and cilantro; spicy, but not that special.   The alfajores (chewy shortbread cookies with dulce de leche - caramelized milk - sandwiched between them), are a great way to finish off the meal, and the passion fruit juice and chicha morada are instant refreshment in the North Carolina heat.",

A lot of my patronage here has been through Postmates (due to the crazy holiday schedule), but having this Elizabeth location is super convenient to Uptown, PlazaMidwood, and Southend.  I highly recommend it and usually if I'm in a quandary of where to take folks for dinner, Viva Chicken always is in my wheelhouse arsenal due to it's flavors as well as vegetarian/gluten options as well.  I'm a big fan of the Inca Wrap and the Yuca fries.  OMG - ALL the sauces are pretty amazing and they do not shy away from spice (beware).  Probably my most favorite is the green (Aji) packed full of jalapenos and cilantro.  1/4 chicken is usually enough for one person and you get two sides!

The great takes some rotisserie chicken, puts it on a ciabatta bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, and an optional avacado.

Her chicken was a bit dried out, but the overall meal was very good.We both had the herbal lemonade with basil, mint and rosemary. This in itself is a reason to return. Prices are reasonable, so I don't know how anyone can complain. We were too full for dessert, maybe next time!

I also tried the yucca which I had never heard of.  I thought they were french fries at first but the consistency is a little different and they are a little sweeter than a potato.

I always  order a quarter chicken and then the plantains, after that, its always a toss-up between the yucca and the rice for my second side. I highly recommend trying the yellow and green sauces they offer. I am not completely positive what is in them, just the fact that they really elevate the chicken and rice.   Also, it may sound strange, but their herbal lemonade! If you haven't tried it yet, I definitely suggest it. There is something about it. I have never had it before and I have yet to find it anywhere else. Its a staple on my Viva Chicken list.   The only issue with this location is space. If you come during lunch in the busy hour, seating can be difficult. The seating area is not large and while they do have some outside seating, that is also limited. Parking can be a little tricky too with the lunch hour but I have yet to not find a spot in the lot across the street.",

I went with a friend and we ordered one whole chicken that came with three sides (yes, call us fatties). Honestly, we had no idea how much food we were about to be given.....But for the price? OH YAS PLS. Luckily, we went RIGHT before it started getting super crowded so we copped some seats. Our order came out within 5 minutes and we were extremely surprised at the amount of food that was set on our table: 1 whole chicken, courteously cut up for us, 1 full basket of sweet potato fries, 3 cups of fresh fruit, 1 huge mound of cilantro rice, and 4 different delectable sauces that I have imprinted on my tastebuds for the rest of my life.  The chicken was absolutely perfect--seasoned to perfection, cooked to perfection, and the cilantro rice complimented it SO well. The rice was so delicious it still makes me sigh thinking about it. It wasn't seasoned in the salt-and-pepper way, per say, but it was infused with cilantro that was seriously packed with flavor. It's not like the cilantro rice from Chipotle where they just sprinkle a few cilantro flakes on the rice--this is LEGIT cilantro rice. The sweet potato fries were FRESH and so good as well. The fresh fruit (consisted of chopped green apples, pineapples, and oranges) actually blew my mind as well: 1. They were ACTUALLY fresh, 2. this combo may seem like nothing special but oh gosh, you have to try it, and 3. it is the perfect fresh, citrusy/acidic combo that refreshes your mouth in between bites of the chicken and rice. The thing that impressed me the most here though was their sauces... I don't know what kind of crack they  put in that stuff but it is the BEST I EVER HAD. I can't.. like....wut?? Wut even?????? I can't even describe what the taste is like because it's just GOOD. like REAL GOOD. Like, you have to try once in your lifetime good. It goes soo well with the rice, fries, and chicken.. If they sold just the sauces separately I would totally stock up.  Next time, I have a bunch of other things I want to try, including their sangria. I definitely feel like I will become a regular here. Plus they are environmentally conscious!",

For my drink, the choice was a little easier because they let me sample the specialty beverages. The Peruvian passion fruit was quite tasty. The food was delicious. The chicken is seasoned well and I love the dipping sauces. The green one is my favorite.   I also got the tres leches cake for dessert. OMG. It was excellent. It was so moist and sweet.

    "text": "WHY IS THIS PLACE SO GOOD!!!??!  I usually don't come to this location since it is so far from me, but I will do anything to get my hands on some Viva Chicken! Every time I come here, I order the same thing. I get the 1/4 chicken (dark meat) with cilantro infused rice and fried yuca. The chicken today was so succulent and tender. Sometimes, they cook it for too long and it ends up being too overcooked but I'm glad today was a good day for them.  The purpose of writing this review is to tell you that if you are coming with others, don't order separately. I made that mistake today and I could've gotten a lot more food! If you order the whole chicken as opposed to just getting 1/4 or 1/2 individually, you end up saving more money and getting more food! They are able to choose not 1, not 2, but 3 sides! Keep this in mind next time you are making a stop at VC!",

    "text": "After reading all the other reviews on Viva, I was a bit skeptical.  How could anyone top my favorite Peruvian place but they did it.    The format here is a bit different than the other Peruvian places.  It's a fast casual format where you order at the counter, they give you a number and then they bring out your food.  I honestly think some of the other Peruvian places around town would do better if they switched to this format.  So what's to try at a Peruvian place to compare it to other places?  The rotisserie chicken, of course!  I ordered the half chicken with plantains and fries.  The chicken was amazing.  I could taste the seasonings and the chicken was very moist.   The plantains were great as well and the fries were the best I've had at a Peruvian restaurant.   And those sauces.  Sometimes that's the best part...dipping your chicken (and fries) in the yellow and green sauces.  Yum.  I love the decor of the place.  It reminds me of Crisp in Dilworth.  They also have a nice patio which is shielded from the neighboring parking lot with rows of plants.    The staff is very friendly here.  They kept coming around to ask if everything was ok or if you needed a drink refill.  Also, most of the paper/plastic products are compostable so they are quite environmentally conscious here.    The only things I didn't care for here are their choice in music...it was very club-ish.  Also the plastic fork didn't do well with handling the chicken.",

So I was visiting for the weekend and my cousin told me about this really good place that's better than Chipotle so I told her \"I'm down to try it.\" There's a lot of healthy options like sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. I ordered the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado which is basically two avocado halves stuffed with quinoa and red peppers on a bed of lettuce with a chipotle mayo drizzled on top. For a drink, I ordered the Maracuya which is a Passionfruit infused. The cashier thought I said I wanted a sample so she gave me one! Yay for not ordering a full drink if I happened to not like it! I ended up sampling all three which were the Herbal Limeade (Basil Infused) and the Chicha Morada. If you're not into cinnamon and cloves, don't order. I preferred the Maracuya over them all. We took our food to go and once I got back home, I devoured it. Super lite meal. Oh, and the Yuca fries are good. Didn't order them but I stole some of hers. It's even better when you dip it in the yellow sauce. Yum!",

It is not your average chicken noodle and I'm already craving it again. When I'm well I want it and if I get sick I'm going to hoard it. Also...that wrap! Fantastic! I'm sure the plain chicken is great. All for about 9 bucks I believe plus the sauces. If a to go order was this good I'm sure eating inside is even better.

Easily the best Peruvian chicken I've ever had (also the only I've ever had). Viva's sauces are great, but not even necessary as the chicken itself packs a serious punch.   The sides held their own as well. I'm not a huge green bean guy, but really enjoyed these. Pretty standard sweet potato fries (not at all an insult), and cilantro infused rice was well flavored and far from bland.",

Love some fried yuka Beans- Really great beans! Extra smoky flavor French Fries- They have really great fries here! Chicken- Chicken was good, but nothing better than your average Peruvian chicken place. We were disappointed that our chicken was not very warm.  Tres Leches- Way too sweet for me Passion fruit Juice- Delicious!!  The sauces for dipping were really great! The one bummer was the chicken.

The quinoa stuffed avocados (with Chicken) are to die for. They are actually on the appetizer menu, but I recommend getting it as your meal. If you get the full order you get a WHOLE avocado (cut in half) or you can opt for the half order, which is a half avocado. I hold food very deep to my heart and I'm telling you now that you won't regret ordering this!  Besides these god sent avocados they have other awesome dishes. I recommend first timers to try the plantains and the white rice with the yellow sauce. I have also had their fried rice with chicken and it was amazing! It's always on their lunch specials too ($6) and the portion size is HUGE! You can easily split it with 2 people.  Now I'm kind of upset that I wrote this review because I'm craving these avocados- maybe I'll head there for lunch :-)  ps. No matter what time I've came they have always been busy so be prepared to search for seating, but I promise you won't regret it!",

Very few times in my life have I smelled something this delicious upon entry.   After looking at the menu for all about 2 minutes, I knew I had to try the soupa de pollo. I'm handed a number and head on over the the drink station, where I run into Yaneth - an employee of the restaurant. As I went to fill my glass with pink lemonade, Yaneth tells me to stop! Because I'm dating a Spanish woman, I know better than to act as if I never heard her and continue filling my cup. She reaches over and makes me fill the other half of the cup with water, then proceeds to add a small collection of lemons. Speaking through my girlfriend in Spanish, she tells me to try this. Man... This stuff was delicious! Very light, but had just enough sweetness.   So, the waitress comes out and trades us our food for the number on our table about 10 minutes after ordering and our feast begins. My girlfriend had the Amazon Cesar salad and gave it two thumbs up. My buddy, Andina power food, which he literally inhaled. Let's just assume that was a good thing.  My food... Well, I scooped a heaping spoonful of the chicken soup from the bowl and shoved it in my mouth. I'm certainly glad I did, as it was bar none the best soup I've had in a long while - possibly ever! A caramel filled churro complimented my soup quite nicely for desert.   Keep doing what you're doing, Viva Chicken!",

The freshness of the ingredients really make the food. My wife ordered rotisserie chicken which is beyond words (amazing). It is buttery and pretty much melts in your mouth. I ordered the arroz chaufa which literally blows any fried rice in the area. The rice was cooked perfectly and the rotisserie chicken adds a great touch.   Another hidden gem and it is pretty good for a chain restaurant.   Order the yuca another fresh side.",

Emily has been my go-to catering professional and is the very best at what she does! Viva Chicken is my personal and professional favorite in Charlotte and has been for the last year+!  They never disappoint.  The chicken is flavorful, the salads are beautiful and fresh, the quinoa avocados are DIVINE, and the cilantro rice, yucca, and plantains are a welcome and refreshing change of pace! The signature yellow sauce and the balsamic vinaigrette are the best ever to complement your chicken, salad, or anything else!  I highly recommend them for catering or just for lunch or dinner!",

After perusing our Charlotte restaurant bucket list (yes, we literally have a list on our fridge), we decided to check out Viva Chicken. Turned out to be a great choice!  Since it is Elizabeth, parking is never good. However, we were able to snag a street spot in front of the restaurant. I did notice that they also had a small side parking lot. Upon entering, we walked up to the counter to place our order, passing by the delicious looking chicken turning over and over roasting.   Between my husband and I, we ordered the half quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken and the quarter chicken with green beans and chicken soup and the herbal lemonade. We then went to the sauce area to grab one of each of the sauces. Ya'll, these sauces are A-mazing!! The mild one was probably my favorite. The quinoa avocado with chicken was perfection. I love love love avocado and this was spot on delish. The sauces on it were a great combo. Next time, we are getting the full order! The quarter chicken was perfectly cooked and so tender. The green beans were nicely roasted. However, as crazy as it sounds, the winner of the night was the chicken soup. It was so basic (chicken, broth, veggies, rice) but so incredibly flavorful. Also, so glad I took the recommendation from a fellow Yelper to order the herbal lemonade cause it was delish!   Excellent meal Viva Chicken!",

I contacted the establishment via their website form to let them know about this and politely requested that they double-check their products. The email I received in response was callous and defensive; a denial that anything was spoiled/contaminated and indirectly calling me a liar about having food poisoning! Mind you, that was the ONLY thing I had eaten so far that day [plus I couldn't consume anything after that except drinking Pedialyte] and up until eating their food I had felt great. Needless to say, after the email I received from customer service rep Randy I will not be giving anymore of my business to an establishment that values their egos more than their customers health! Eat there at your own risk and be prepared for a \"It couldn't have been us\" response in case you do get ill from the food and inform them of it.  Update: the Health Dept did an inspection after I contacted them about this issue and found several violations! Feel free to look it up being it's public record.",

A hungry man could probably eat it for two meals.  For my little tummy though it's the perfect dish to stretch over the week. I also love their green (spicy) and yellow (kinda sweet/savory/mild) sauces they make.  Such a unique flavor.",

I have ordered the Viva Chicken Salad, which is delicious and flavorful, topped with their amazing rotisserie chicken, veggies, feta cheese, and several hearty slices of avocado. I have also had their whole rotisserie chicken with three sides - amazing deal to feed several people for only $22! The chicken was full of flavor and very tender, and I enjoyed all three sauces it came with (especially the aji amarillo sauce). You can't go wrong with their cilantro infused rice and canary beans, which go excellently with the chicken, but the star of the show is their sweet plantains. Amazing taste, perfectly fried and ripe. I'm anxious to try their other offerings at some point too!",

The green \"mint\" sauce was okay but I personally think the other two are much better! The yuca was yummy and the plantains were really thickly cut. My aunt got the same thing I did and my grandmother got a salad. Everyone enjoyed their meals! All in all the portion size was very filling and I would absolutely come back again in the future, but most likely for take out! The only downside in my opinion, and the reason for preferring take out is it's VERY loud. The music was up too high so everyone had to talk over it making the noise levels too much for me.",

High points are the maracuya juice and the maracuya dessert -- I like sour flavors and they are most delicious. The quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken is another winner. Most of the sides are pretty tasty. I would say that everything comes off a little more \"fast-foody\" than other Peruvian chicken I've had in town. It's something about the spice blends -- there's a lot of intensity on the salt and black pepper but some of the more subtle flavors are lost, and items that aren't peppery, like the various potato salads, can be just a bit bland. Which is not to say that I would not eat there again. It's an overall good restaurant experience, the patio is a lovely place to sit, and the sangria is delicious and not too strong to drink at lunch.",

I never thought I would look forward to a salad, but it always fills me, and I feel like I am eating healthy.  This place is a must.",

It's simple, but has all of my faves: feta, avocado, red onion, chicken, and the most addictive sweet balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I usually order extra dressing -- it's that good. There are three locations, and I only wish is that they expand to the South End. It gets so busy, but the staff is great about getting your food out quickly.   I'm new to Charlotte, so I can't wait to try the other items on the menu. But geez, that salad is so good it seems like sacrilege to deviate from my norm.",

I recommend the dark meat as its the most tasty but the white meat is good as well.  I don't think the meat by itself is 5-star quality, but the two sauces that come with it put the meat over the top.  The yellow sauce (mild) is my Fav, but the green (medium) is very good as well.  Where Viva Chicken really shines are the side items.  To date, I've had the green beans, sweet potato fries, and plantains.  All 3 of these items are excellent.  The sweet potato fries are fairly similar to what you get at other places, but great quality overall.  The green beans are very unique with an interesting/spicy flavor combination and they appear to be skillet cooked by their texture.  Overall best side item IMO.  The plantains are great.  I'm not an expert on plantains by any means, but I love the ones here.  The herbal lemonade is amazing (if you like lemonade) so I really recommend that as well.  Overall this is a a great lunch place and a good chill dinner place.  Overall very casual atmosphere, really love the porch.",

WOW.   The La Butifarra and the Classic Saltado share equal space in second place but can easily hold there own if I'm feeling like mixing it up a little for the night.

The restaurant offers a variety of vegetarian options for everyone from salads to sandwiches and wraps and even signature juices!  I had the Inca Wrap on my first visit and  highly recommend it! It's delicious! It's a tomato wrap with canary beans, rice, avocado and salsa. You can add chicken or steak to it if you're more of a carnivore.

The sweet potato fries were pretty standard, the beans were plentiful but bland, and the yucca fries were perfectly cooked, but we got so few. Oddly, the sweet potato fries came in a big basket, the beans came in a large plastic dish, but the yucca only came in a small cup. I would guess we had about 6 to split between the two of us. For comparison, they were so generous with the beans that we took half of them home with us. I would definitely go again, but I hope they start giving bigger portions for the yucca fries.",

The soup \"Sopa de Pollo\" was phenomenal because of its simplicity. The Yuca fries are my favorite fries of all, which is a lot to say for myself. They're larger than the typical fry-size, but the Yuca \"meat\" on the inside has a wonderful taste that's not bland and the batter on the outside wasn't too thick and lightly salted. I ordered the 1/4 Chicken and 2 Sides with the cilantro infused rice as my other side. Chicken was cooked to perfection; the meat wasn't too dry and the skin wasn't too greasy. Overall, Viva Chicken is probably going to be my go-to spot for simple, yet heart-warming dishes.",

My guests are still calling me to talk about how great that food was. Chelsea (the Catering Manager) was an absolute delight to work with.  She was so gracious, flexible and attentive.  She actually made the delivery and set up herself and was on time and had everything I ordered perfectly.  I have been in the F&B business for over 30 years - and I can say she is one of the best I have worked with!!  I would hire her in a minute.  Wondering what to order? I would say - order  more chicken than you expect you will need and for sure more quinoa avocados than you think your group would possibly eat.  Trust me - you will not have any leftovers!",

    "text": "Great food, Great experience!  Peruvian chicken was not on my radar during my visit to Charlotte, but this place was great!  In addition to the chicken, I had a yucca fries and a small salad.  The salad, which I anticipated to be lackluster, came with a great dressing and was a hearty portion of romaine.  I also had one of their drinks-chicha morada (it's only ten cents more than a soft drink?!), definitely a good choice.  It wasn't as sweet as I would expect something that color to be, which was a great relief!   The place was packed with a long line, but things moved quickly and our food came out to our table quickly as well.  We hung out here awhile after finishing our meal chatting and catching up but never felt rushed or that we needed to give up our seat.",

The chicken is so flavorful and moist.  The sandwich doesn't really need any sauce, but the accompanying sauce on the side really does add a new depth of flavor when added.  Customer service is impeccable as well.  My 5 yr old spilled his very full cup of fruit all over the floor.  They immediately came to help us clean up and brought another fruit cup free of charge.  I really appreciated this as it was totally our fault that the fruit cup spilled in the first place.  It's small, kind gestures like this that will make me a dedicated patron.  Thanks to the owners and management for a well trained staff and great, healthy food choices!",

    "text": "My wife told me that I would really like this Peruvian chicken place but I was perhaps more than a little skeptical.  Oh honey, you were right, I love this place, you were right (again). Each time I've gone I've enjoyed a quarter or a half of the Peruvian rotisserie chicken with either two or three sides: I've very much enjoyed the fried plantains, green beans and French fries.  I don't recall the other offerings but they were all tempting.  I enjoyed very much the ones I've tried and the chicken was superb.  I will never indulge in cost co or Grocery rotisserie chicken again. In addition to chicken dishes they serve a variety of quality healthful salads.  Sick of chicken, last visit, my father opted for s salad.  When they asked him, however, if he wanted an add on he inquired what were the choices and he ended up adding pulled chicken!  The salad (and add on) were ample, high quality, and my father said delicious. I also had one of their inventive (non alcoholic) specialty lemonade drinks and it was worth every one of the approximately 200 cents it cost.  Kind of half way between a lemonade and a smoothie. On one visit the service was slow and we were compensated with two different delicious deserts.  Their service is usually very good so I don't have much hope I'd getting a future reward for poor service. I have never picked up a to go order but it must be a good thing cause I notice them doing a robust pick up business.  I think you can also have your order placed in advance on your smart phone or computer.",

Appearances are deceptive, and it offers some of the most succulent chicken complemented by a bed of well-seasoned, cilantro-infused rice that has me wanting for more. As one who loves spice, this hits the spot. Top that of with the sweet, char-grilled plantains! What a delight.  Super affordable. Eco-friendly. Only complaint regards the often overly-eager employees that often request to dispose of plates prematurely. Still, the food has me coming back for more! 9/10!",

We ordered for 4 people the whole chicken with 3 sides: solterito, plantains and the cilantro rice. Ok, so the solterito is basically a salad with corn, edamame and tomatoes that is on point! Both the rice and solterito came in big portions, but the plantains were in a small container, so I'm not sure about that for the side portion size. Ok, I know this is weird but the FRIES are amazing. We ordered an extra side of these. I don't know what they coated them with, but they were crispy, hot and perfect. We weren't able to finish all the food with the 4 of us! So good portion size!  Chicken was really good, white meat was a bit dry but, nothing was too salty. I think it's a great deal. I asked about the drinks b/c I would have gotten them if they didn't have sugar in them butttt they did, so I opted out just b/c I'm trying to eat less sugar!",

    "text": "I've been hearing about Viva Chicken since I started traveling down here for work over a year ago and I only just now tried it today.  Why that is... I have no idea.  I feel like I've been missing out on life for so long.  I first attempted to order via Postmates, but the place was so busy that they cancelled my order and stopped taking new ones.  So... I hopped in an Uber and made the short drive over to the restaurant and picked up my phoned-in order.  The minute I walked into the restaurant I knew I'd made a good decision.  The place was insanely busy and it smelled amazing.  I was able to quickly pick up my order via the dedicated order pick up line.  Make sure you throw utensils inside because they didn't include any with my takeout order.  I ordered a 1/4 chicken combo (comes with 2 sides for under $9!) with a chicken soup and sweet potato fries.  The rotisserie chicken here is probably the best I've had anywhere, including a few Peruvian restaurants in NYC.  It was extremely flavorful and almost didn't need any sauce to go with it.  The chicken soup was also delicious, but for some reason all the veggies were almost raw - not sure if it's supposed to be like this.  The sweet potato fries are pretty standard and slightly soggy.. might taste better if you dined in.    They have 3 sauces with different bases, but you can choose from mild, medium, and spicy.  I went with medium, which was a lime/cilantro flavor with a kick as well as the spicy, which was more creamy and pepper based.  I liked both, but neither are like the green sauce I've had at other Peruvian places.  I saw a lot of people get their fresh drinks... may have to try that next time too.  Overall, an excellent deal for delicious rotisserie chicken and sides.  The menu is pretty clean too and nothing too unhealthy (you can choose all white meat, too).  YUM!",

We ended up with an order of chicken, rice, plantains, and green beans. I have to say I would have never picked green beans, but they ended up being one of the stars of the meal! They season them with something a bit spicy as well as soy sauce. The end result is a flavor bomb of delicious. The chicken was so tender and well seasoned. I didn't even need a knife to eat it. The plantains had the most amazing crispy caramelized edges! To the naked eye the rice looked quite plain, but was soooo flavorful!   I'm already dreaming of my next trip to Charlotte so I can visit Viva Chicken again. It's one in a million!",

I also sampled all the juices and they were all great but I went with the passion fruit drink. Loved it, will definitely be back soon",

The chicken was well seasoned and really could be eaten without the famous sauces. But the sauce....The roasted yellow pepper sauce (forget the name) is probably the best sauce I've eaten with chicken...or anything else for that matter!   The rice was nice and fragrant and refreshing, if that makes sense. It wasn't sticky or heavy at all. This place stays very busy. I'd suggest attempting to save a table before you order if possible. The only negative is that this location seems to have more tables than space. So it can get quite crowded. But otherwise, a great place for healthy and tasty food! Can't wait to get back.",

Now I understand it's lunch and a Friday, but come on guys. You are clearly fully staffed. Everyone appears busy, but your system is horrible. Unless this bird was piping hot (which means they just cooked the chicken) to the point of me having to wait until it cools before eating, there is no excuse for the time it took to prepare a very basic, and non modified order. Do better. Set a better standard for yourself. Until then, I'll take coin elsewhere.",

I grew up in Washington, DC eating authentic Central and South American chicken, and this is just as good! We really like to eat a healthy and balanced diet, but don't always have the energy to cook. Viva Chicken lets us be lazy and still get healthy rotisserie chicken and delicious sides.   Our favorite go-to is the whole chicken with three large sides. The salads come with amazing mixed greens, crumbled cheese, fresh cucumber, onion, and tomato and a not-too-sweet balsamic vinaigrette.  We also really enjoy the cilantro lime rice and the green beans which come with little pieces of red pepper.   The three standard sauces are delicious too. There's one in there for every taste. (Mild, medium and hot.)  As a bonus, for those of us who care about these things (like me!) the chicken is all 100% natural and free range, and cooked every 45 minutes. Nothing is ever old or of low quality. For this quality of chicken, the prices are incredibly reasonable!  For the earth-friendly nuts (also like me!), the cutlery, plates, straws and cups in the restaurant are all 100% biodegradable, and their take-home containers are extremely durable and very reusable. We have a stockpile of them and use them to pack our lunches every day. They even survive the dishwasher, dozens of times over! :) (Free Tupperware?! Yay!)  If you eat at the restaurant, they have beer and wine, which is a very nice touch.  All in all, we have been there many times, and we plant to keep going back on a very regular basis.",

The sauces are absolutely killer too. The lines can be long sometimes and finding a seat can be tricky but I have never had a problem with the food. Ultimately that is what you come here for, right?",

Almost want me to start driving as I am writing this. haha;  My wife who usually goes chicken? what chicken? fell in love with this place. The seasoning was perfect and cooked perfectly.  The wrap was nice too and the sweet potato fries were to die for wife says, and I agree. They are crispy on the outside, and tender inside with right amount of salt to it.  oh and if you are getting a drink, make sure to try their herb lemonade. It'll make you wonder why you never thought about making a lemonade that way.",

But this is more of a California type of fresh rather than a homey, hole in the wall type of restaurant. So actually, it is completely different from Pio Pio.  I had the aptly named, \"The Great\" sandwich and it was amazing and incredibly well priced.   The service was super friendly and the atmosphere matched the bright, fresh flavors of the food.  It is a winner for all these reasons and because it is a few blocks from my house.  Glad to see this place open because this unit has been cursed.. even Starbucks closed here.. They are here to stay.",

The food is delicious. We had the 1/4 chicken with infused rice and plantains and the classic saltado. Everything was cooked wonderfully, and absolutely delicious. There was also two types of sauces served with the food that were really different and insanely flavorful. We also had the maracuya juice- highly recommend it, as an islander. I also really liked that they served everything on biodegradable dishes. And to put that fifth star on there- the service was very gracious and attentive.",

I could feel myself getting sick and I knew I needed something more than tofu protein, so I bit the bullet. I do this about once every 6 months in an act of desperation. It never works. I'm home sick today writing this review, but I really enjoyed the chicken so meh it was worth the break!  After a couple of years being vegan I don't usually enjoy chicken but this was so good. The Peruvian spices were excellent on the chicken and the the rotisserie was fresh and tender, but the side sauces were insane. I especially liked the green one. I'm definitely going back on vegan days because they also had this amazing avocado stuffed with quinoa and tons of other sides I didn't get a chance at that look amazing. Ooh and dessert. I didn't get my dessert. Noooo! The tragedy of being sick! Viva Chicken we have business.",

It's a green sauce that is soooo good on everything.   The sides are wonderful too. If you get the fried plantains or yucca I suggest getting them slightly well done so they're super crunchy on the outside while still being tender on the inside. My WHOLE family loves the chicken and fries for lunch (even my very picky daughter). For about $6 you get 1/4 chicken, fries (or side) and a drink. Not only is it a value, but considering most of the serving utensils are recycled/bio and the food is FRESH with a capital F, it's a miracle they can stay afloat.   For an extra Peruvian feel, sit outside in the \"garden\" while you dine.",

I love it when something so simple is done so well and Viva Chicken has done it. while they offer a variety of menu items from stuffed avocados, to salads and unique sandwiches, My favorite is of course the 1/4 Chicken with 1 green sauce (on the spicy side) and 1 yellow ( milder) sauce. The chicken is seasoned to perfection and you can taste a variety of herbs and spices in  the sauces. I also love the herbal lemonade because of the fresh herbs including basil mixed in.My favorite side is the yucca which comes with another yummy sauce or the infused rice. I try to get the green beans or salad most of the time to keep it healthy but after an after work run the yucca along with the chicken hits the spot.    These guys have something awesome here and maybe one day they will open more locations which I think would be a great fast casual competitor to a Boston Market or something Like Zoe's kitchen because their food is definitely great tasting and fresh. the churros aren't half bad either.",

Walked over here from the hospital across the street and so glad we did.  The grilled Peruvian chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly, so tender.  The green beans were seriously perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The yucca, the plantains...yes, please.  And dont leave without trying the arroz chaufa...a fusion style fried rice...OMG!  The sangria was exactly to my liking, not uber sweet, nice and cold with lots of fruit chunks.  If i lived here, i would go back in a heartbeat!",

The corn salad is quite tasty and refreshing, and the bean soup was also very good.   I wasn't a huge fan of the plantains (too much sugary glaze), but my wife loved them. Overall, this is great food at a good price.",

I shared sweet potato fries & plantains with a friend. It's fair to say I've been craving all three items since my visit last week.  There was plenty of staff working here on a weekday evening & they visited our table several times to check on us & offer water refills.   Despite the summer heat, the covered patio in the evening, with the fans going was the perfect place to hang out with some friends.  The only drawback that gives me pause to make a quick stop on my way home from my uptown office is the parking situation. I ended up parking a block up the way on the street at a meter. My friends said there was some parking in nearby lots, but there's so much construction in this area right now & restricted lots for the hospital, I wasn't sure where I could park. Alas, a call to restaurant in advance didn't shed any light on available lots since they couldn't give me specifics about which lots were available for their diners.",

They are really yummy and they pull the meal together and make it unique. Its what I love about the place. It is also relatively healthy for eating out compared to most grab and go restaurants. Every dish is based with rotisserie chicken! They really do make it really well, and rather healthy too. Don't forget the sauces, though. That's the best part!!!",

    "text": "There are a number of things in life that I repeatedly choose to do even though I secretly know they're certain to end in heartbreak. Buying scratch lottery tickets comes to mind, as does going to see Adam Sandler movies. And on the food side, we have rotisserie chicken. It always looks so great with its glistening crisp skin, but when you get this at a restaurant, you are almost certainly assured to bite into something with the approximate moisture content of the Atacama desert.   Viva, however, has defied the laws of \"gastrophysics\". Let me count the ways in which this chicken reigns supreme:  1. Moisture: When I started at the breast, I seriously thought I had accidentally grabbed dark meat instead. But no, it was merely the juciest roasted white meat I have had the privilege to come across. Yowza.  2. Flavor: The Peruvian seasonings on this stuff are mysterious but deeply satisfying. While the skin is of course the best part, even the meat itself had a complex flavor profile.  3. MORE flavor: If the seasonings weren't enough, the chicken comes with two sauces. The yellow one is sort of mustard-y, and the green one is more garlicky, sort of like a chimichurri. I literally spent the whole meal alternating between the two and thinking \"This one's better. No, THIS one's better. No, the first one was better.\" If I hadn't eventually finished the chicken, this probably would have put me in an asylum.  Add to this experience a truly fabulous Peruvian response to chicken noodle soup, and you have an utterly undeniable reason to head over to Elizabeth.",

Quarter chicken is $8.25, so unless you really need 2 sides each, you have just saved yourself $5. I always enjoy the fried yuca & sweet plantains, but lately I'm hooked on the cilantro rice. Most importantly I like the green and yellow sauces that come with each dish. Be warned: it's garlicky, don't plan on kissing anyone afterward without a serious mint or mouth wash.  Recently we walked in right after closing time (9pm) and the manager waved us in. I always like to give credit to places for not turning away diners (next time I'll know better).   The patio is very quaint and a nice quiet spot to enjoy a conversation.  And oh, they just started a new reward program, it's on an iPad in front of the register.

The concept is good, but they tend to take whatever is present in the kitchen and shove it into the sandwiches/wraps.  They over-sauce the meats, literally drowning any meat flavor.  I really think when you're using too many ingredients, the result is confusing to your mouth and messy without being fun.  Perhaps the key is to request they hold a few of the items in your salad/sandwich/wrap and see if it helps.  Hopefully they don't drown it because the chicken is poor quality.  I think the overall ingredients may be fine, but the construction is overdone.  Probably won't eat here again, although it is reasonable price-wise.",

For the most part is was good, but I have had better at Boston Market.  My main issue was the fact that there was a portion of the chicken that was still pink and undercooked.  Some of the meat \"refused\" to be pulled from the bone.  The best way to tell if a chicken is well done is when the wing pulls easily from the breast meat.  The wing on my piece and her piece did not want to  pull easily from the breast meat.  In fact it did not release at all.  The part that was done tasted okay, but if I am paying it all better taste good.  You guys try it and tell me if you like it.",

I had this amazing Fried Rice dish with chicken. Savory, fresh and full of flavor. I also got the appetizer with fries and chozio that comes with three dipping sauces.   I think almost everything on the menu was ordered by someone at our table and we shared our food with each other as we caught up on our lives.   They have delivery and take-out is quick and easy, as is the parking right across the street. It's also one of those places that you can grab a quick bite to eat while your by yourself without feeling odd about dining alone. And speak of dining, the dining area is a little small, but there's a heated seating area that looked to be quite large and they welcome pets there.  I should have grabbed a menu so that I could be more intelligent about describing what we ordered, but you'll just have to take my word for it. This place is that good!",

This place is ridiculous and I am seriously upset at myself for taking such a long time to check it out and therefore depriving myself of this deliciousness for so long. First of all, I LOVE Peruvian rotisserie chicken and have been obsessed with it for over 8 years now. I went to school in DC and fell madly in love with \"The Chicken Place\" in Falls Church, VA. Ever since moving back, I have pretty much boycotted Peruvian chicken places since I didn't think I would ever find anything that could compete, but I was wrong.   Today my husband picked up Viva Chicken and brought it to me at work. I ordered \"The Great\" sandwich, with fried Yucca as a side and all 3 sauces that they have available. I believe that sauces are extremely important in Peruvian cuisine and without good sauce you've got nothing, so let me start with the sauces in order or spiciest to least spicy: Roasted Rocoto Sauce (also known as the Gringo killer) although I am not a Gringa, I do not think this sauce lived up to its name as far as spice goes, but MORE than made up for that in flavor. It is a little spicy, a little vinegary and completely full of flavor, I think it kind of tasted like a vinegar based South American BBQ sauce! The Huacatay sauce was also very good, it is dark green and full of different herbs, making it slightly spicy but full of flavor. Now, for the Piece de resistance, the Aji Amarillo sauce. It is not spicy at all, but I don't care and no one else should because this is the tastiest damn sauce on the face of this planet. This is the essence of Peruvian cooking, I just want to put it in a bag and inject it into my veins intravenously 24/7, its magnificent. It's the kind of sauce that makes you not want to brush your teeth for three days just so you don't lose the flavor!  The sandwich I had, \"The Great,\" came with pulled rotisserie chicken, onions, tomato, lettuce and smoked rocoto mayo on ciabatta bread. It was a really good sandwich, but once I put the Aji Amarillo and Roasted Rocoto Sauce on it, it because a fantastic sandwich. To be honest, Yucca normally always requires sauce because it can be a little dry, but this Yucca was perfect all on it's own. It was not dense at all, it was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and although it didn't need sauce, it was perfection dipped in a mix of the Huacatay and Aji Amarillo.  The food was just fantastic and I cannot wait to go back and try something else (probably tomorrow)... and drench it in unhealthy amounts of the Aji Amarillo sauce!",

They were packed during lunch hour during the week so would suggest to go for dinner if you want a quick grab.   I got their lemonade which was okay, not up to my taste buds but that's just me.   I'm definitely making lots of trips back!",

My only qualm is that the prices continually go up (which I understand to some degree is outside of their control) so what would have been $ is now $$.",

    "text": "Viva Chicken is the answer to the prayer you didn't even know you had. It provides high quality, inexpensive, healthy food muy rapido!  The casual restaurant has counter service and a sleek, modern interior with a large side covered patio with super cute planters in painted gutters (which is an odd thing to mention in a review, but it really does add to the airy ambiance).  This place had some formidable predecessors - anyone remember the institution that was Anderson's with their great down home $3 eggs or the Starbucks where there was never a line?  But Viva Chicken fills the void and more.  The menu offers Peruvian features with rotisserie chicken at the centerpiece.  You can always get traditional quarter or half chickens with delicious sides such as pan fried plantains, spicy beans or rice pilaf, and the chicken is delicious like Genaro's (better than Pio Pio). Or you can get the beloved quinoa stuffed avocado, salad or sandwich. The first time I went, I got the Naked Peruvian which provides perfectly ripe avocado with veggies and I neglected to order chicken on it. Well it was such a happy accident because it didn't need it- the smokiness of the grilled ciabatta compliments the veggies so much it is one of my favorite vegetarian meals! (Tip: the grilled ciabatta really is better eaten there and gets soggy if you take it to go)  The creamy aji amarillo (yellow pepper) complements the sandwich and just about all of the chicken dishes and adds some zingy spiciness without setting your mouth on fire.  In fact, even though I don't usually like creamy sauces, this is my favorite sauce I've ever had at a chicken place. The steak sandwich offers a more substantial option and is a house favorite.   Desserts feature the alfajores (powdered sugar dulce de leche cookies), tres leches cake and flan. I make tres leches at home and I have to say that this is the only tres leches cake in Charlotte that holds its own against mine if I do say so myself. It is super moist and delicious without tasting of preservatives. I look forward to trying the Sangria sometime.  I am a huge fan of this place because of the food, decor and service so it already earned 5 stars in my book, but it gets extra credit because Mondays they donate portion of proceeds to a designated local nonprofit, and they use eco-friendly corn-based \"silverware\".  I'm surprised they don't use actual silverware because that is the most eco-friendly, but happy with the corn-based stuff.   Tip: Go Mondays!",

We'll pick one up for carry-out, and every one is still moist and delicious by the time we get home.  The plantains are pretty tasty and their beans have a special place in my heart.  I'm not normally a big fan of that style of bean, but these just rock my socks.  Their sauces are what really set them appart though.  They have three different sauces all at different heat levels, but each also has it's own unique flavor.  My favorite is the light green one, but all three are great, and I don't find them to be too hot.     The combo will feed us both for a couple days, or we'll use the chicken in a recipe.  At that price it's pretty hard to beat.  I'm pretty sure Viva will remain our go to place for that lazy night when we just can't decide what to make or get.",

Me too, I  really needed some new lunch choices and something close to work and boy oh boy was I happy to find Viva Chicken.  If you haven't tried Peruvian food yet then this is your chance, and you will not be disappointed.   Thanks to JJ G.'s review I went for the Tacu Bowl (but with chicken) for me!  It's the delicious green sauce that really made the dish, I don't recall the name but I'll take a gallon of it please.  Fresh avocados and plenty of food to fill this hungry belly.  The menu has plenty of options even for the picky eaters out there.  I also noticed a summer menu at the register featuring some good looking salads.    While looking around the restaurant you can see just about every patron munching on the Pollo a la Brasa (Peruvian rotisserie chicken) I know this is the thing to get at this restaurant and I can't wait to get back to try it.  You can even order a whole chicken and sides to go walla dinner is served.   For lunch or dinner Viva is a great choice the outdoor patio is awesome and filled with plants and cute decor.  Even though it's counter service you still feel like your getting full service at you table.  Fast, healthy, and authentic just what I was looking for!",

Whoever did this you can't do that, that's wrong and you shouldn't have done that.\" The girl ringing me up said \"well it wasn't me!\" and the other girl glances at me and snarkily says \"well, she insisted.\" It was unacceptable for the one person to scold workers in front of a customer and the fact that the cashier lied and said I insisted it be pulled was so rude! I couldn't believe the unprofessionalism from a place that is typically so great - at least the Ballantyne location is. Very dissatisfied with the service today.  Of course, the food is amazing! Just wish the service matched.",

I got the Tiku bowl (which is easily 2-3 servings, depending on how hungry you are) which featured canary beans, cilantro rice, pickled vegetables, and I added avocado for a small upcharge. It was DIVINE!! I also tried the Yucca fries which are crispy and completely unlike french fries.   There are SO MANY vegetarian options, but I think the Tiku bowl is the best bang for my buck.   I highly recommend this place and plan to take everyone I know :-).",

For my first time I wasn't sure what to expect, there is a line and a chalkboard style menu on the wall. The girl at the counter was a little impatient. So maybe check out the menu  and have an idea of what you like before you go.  I had the viva salad and my husband had a taco bowl. Both very good.  Two Birdsong jalapeno IPAs to round out the meal.  Also couldn't resist a slice of tres leches. Very sweet and rich, enough to share.  Great prices for the quality of food.  Beautiful modern decor inside and a great patio. No music playing while we dined which seemed strange. I will definitely be back to try a rotisserie chicken, or maybe get it to go.",

    "text": "Experience: We had family in town from Canada. We had three adults and four children; two of them under the age of three. We ordered Arroz Chaufa, the Whole Chicken with three sides, and drinks for the table. The two youngest ones were busy being young children. The waitstaff was amazingly helpful to get us set up to eat by getting grabbing all of our plates and cutlery, the napkins, and even got all of our drinks and sauces at the station. Such kindness from the waitstaff to the point they were constantly attentive to ensure we were able to eat. I requested to speak to the manager and unexpectedly got the owner who was kind, personable, and extremely appreciative.  Floor and Ambiance: We actually eat at this restaurant every once in a while for lunch and the restaurant is super busy during those times. The restaurant is always clean and well stocked. The tables and chairs are always wiped down almost immediately after someone gets up from a finished meal so that you can sit to eat. They have a small covered outside patio that you can eat and the delivery of the food comes right to the table immediately after being cooked. The only slight drawback is that the sauce counter and soda fountain is a hotspot for foot traffic within the restaurant, but can easily be remedied.  Food: The food is excellent! From the rotisserie Peruvian chicken to the Arroz Chaufa, they blend the best combination of leveled savory tones which and cook it to perfection keeping the chicken soft and moist. I've not experienced one single dry piece of chicken yet. With a similar spice profile, the fried rice is exceptionally filling and plentiful. The salads are humongous and the sandwiches are hearty. I always take a to-go box home with me and share with the kids. We had a couple of the desserts and both the tres leches and churros will fill that sweet tooth longing, but not make you feel overly saturated with sugar or overindulged.   Cost: This, in my opinion, is the best part and a fantastic value for such a reward when you think about everything that you get with your purchase. One example is the rotisserie chicken and three sides.   Cleanliness, exceptional service, fantastic food, large portions, and low prices make this one of my favorite places to eat. I want this place to continue to be successful so that Charlotte can continue to expand it's culinary diversity and keep places like this around.",

To test this place out, on my first visit I went with the classic quarter white, beans and cilantro rice.  The chicken was very moist and well seasoned.  They serve it with both the mild and medium sauces...couldn't decide which I liked better.  I was also impressed with the cilantro rice.  Beans I could take or leave but tried a friend's yucca...crispy outside, creamy center, delicious.  Second visit I tried the Viva Chicken Salad.  A large plate of greens topped with pulled chicken, feta, avocado, a little onion and tomato and their house dressing which is maybe a sweet balsamic. I'd take this salad over one from Crisp any day. Aside from the food, the staff is extremely courteous and helpful, the prices are very reasonable, the restaurant is eco-conscious and it doesn't hurt that it's next to my favorite music venue.

Their chicken is all-natural,  free range and slow roasted.  I opted for the vegetarian selection of the quinoa stuffed avocado with a side of plantains.  Wow . . . I was incredibly impressed!  You are served the largest avocado I have possibly ever seen.  Each half ifs filled with well seasoned quinoa and topped with a chipotle ranch/balsamic drizzle and served over a bed of lettuce.  Due to the size, I ate only one of the avocado halves and saved the other for a different meal.  The plantains were rich and well seared on the outside, not too dry or overcooked like they can be at many restaurants.  We had nearly a dozen different dishes between the whole group and I didn't hear a single complaint out of anyone.  I'll definitely be back to visit Viva in the future!",

I got sweet potato fries and the cilantro-infused rice-- both were excellent.  I have to say the different sauces were a close second to the chicken itself. You order at the counter, and they deliver--paper plates and plastic silverware, but it definitely felt like a sit down place because the service was friendly and attentive. We sat in the lovely, closed-in, heated garden patio. I can't wait to go back again.",

The chicken has such great flavor and their sauces (my favorite is obviously the hot) add another interesting layer to it. I got the 1/4 chicken which comes with 2 sauces and 2 sides. The beans were not your standard sweet baked bean but more of a grilled flavor, if that makes sense. The plantains were like a secret dessert (hey its a side, technically) and were just tender and sweet enough. When you get the quarter chicken you can pick light or dark meat, and Jake, who got the half chicken, said next time he would just go for the light quarter since there was not a ton of extra meat on the dark section. A quarter chicken meal runs you $8, which feels super reasonable for all the food and flavors you get. I'll definitely be back to eat my way through a whole flock, one quarter at a time.",

    "text": "4.5 stars... My little family dined at Viva Chicken last evening on the recommendation of a coworker; I'm so happy we did. I just looked up the reviews while enjoying the leftovers, and was surprised to see so few reviews so far (though I know they just opened recently). We had a great experience, the people at the counter happily answered questions about the menu and were very accommodating (they're still working on a kids' menu). My husband tried the 1/4 chicken with fries and beans, and I tried the Arroz Chaufa, both of which were delicious - great flavors! We thought the prices were very reasonable and serving sizes generous (enough for a full lunch for me today, still yummy). It took a little while for our food to come out (not compared to a sit down restaurant, but perhaps for a counter-style place), but we were still very pleased with the friendly service throughout our meal (stopped by a few times to check in to see if we needed anything and to clear items from our table). Easy (and free) parking in the lot across the street. We'll be back...",

It was unexepectedly casual, order at the counter, serve your own drink, paper plates and plastic cutlery, but that was ok. The food was quite good. My wife and i shared avocado with quinoa which she loved more than i. However i had the fried rice with chicken. Big portions and a nice flavor that was even better when i mixed in the spicy green sauce that came with it. My wife got a quarter of roasted chicken with beans and great sweet plantains. We both got passion fruit, maracuya, juice which was delightful. All this  for 30 bucks. I thought it was a great deal for some tasty food. We will definitely be back.",

Let's start out with the staff...they were all superb! I was welcomed when I walked in with a smile, asked if I had any questions or needed suggestions and then given a reward card...it only takes 5 purchases until you get a free meal free!!! Whoo hooo!  I didn't have to wait long, and my food arrived. I loved the salad. It comes with cucumbers, tomatoes and feta cheese. And the dressing was delicious!!! My taste buds were very happy!!!   The chicken and fries arrived HOT. Very, very tasty! I loved the crispy fries and the well seasoned and very moist chicken. Yummy!!! I really enjoyed mixing the chicken and the fries in the accommodating yellow sauce which was a little spicy, just like I like it!   There are so many more things on the menu that I look forward to trying off their menu! I definitely can't wait to come back!",

It comes on a bed of lettuce, so it's essentially a small salad with a whole avocado and quinoa and it's incredible. Another great option is the Naked Peruvian Wrap w/chicken and get the Balsamic Vinaigrette to dip it in and it's essentially the stuffed avocado in a wrap form and it's slightly more filling, although both are very delicious and filled with the same things - you just get a tortilla wrap and a side with the wrap so that's why it's a bit more filling. But my go to is the avocado dish. It's truly incredible. Their herbal lemonade is so yummy too! You won't regret dining here. Take out or dine in :)",

However there seems to be a takeout order fulfillment problem at this store. The two times I've taken out the order has been wrong (I've only taken out two times.) First time I ordered a whole chicken (all dark which they'll do which is cool.) I came home and there was only a half chicken. When I called to complain they offered to change it if I came back. I didn't want to go out again so they ended up comping my food. Correct response.  Tonight I called in my order for a whole dark chicken and went to pick it up. Thankfully I checked my order before I left. This time they had given me an all white chicken.

Plain and simple it's just really freaking good.  Went for lunch on a weekday and it was packed. Almost a bit disorganized, but the line moved quickly and a table opened up on the patio. I got The Great sandwich like usual, adding bacon and avocado. And like usual, it was incredible. Tender, flavorful chicken, great bread, and the toppings all added something to the sandwich. The yellow sauce is absolutely out of this world and the green sauce is pretty darn good, too. Yucca fries were excellent as they always are.  The staff is always checking on your table and offers to refill water and clear plates--always super friendly. Parking was easy across the street in a lot. While I doubt I'll come back to this location anytime soon, I'll be at the one in Ballantyne as much as I can.",

I then proceeded to order the 1/4 dark meat rotisserie style chicken as the dark meat is always going to be juicer and more flavorful then the white meat. Anyways my two sides were yucca fries and canary beans which are similar to pinto beans and the way they are cooked is almost the same. As we were dinning several different staff members stopped by to see how we liked the food and to clear the empty plates. So another fantastic lunch in Charlotte for me today.

I got the dark meat with plantains and cilantro rice and my husband got white meat with fries and green beans. Everything was amazing! If ever craving great chicken this is the place for you!!!   Also got the lemonade....it's green. It's still good... But it's green.   Also Inca cola is not really cola... It's yellow bubblegum soda... So if that's not your thing....",

My favorite salad is the Limena Chopped ($6.95 + $2.45 for chicken) with chicken, of course! The Peruvian corn is a delicious surprise. This is a hearty salad that meets the standard of a \"meal\" with ease. I rarely eat it in one sitting.   My other go-to is the classic 1/4 chicken with two sides ($8.95). I get plantains and cilantro rice as my sides and properly use all three sauces offered on every single bite!   The stuffed avocado ($8.25) is another favorite of mine, and yes I add chicken to that too. And the sauces, of course the sauces.",

Before I tell you about the food, let me just say that the day I visited was so PACKED! I don't know if it's always like this, but it took me a good 10/15 minutes just to place my order. It was another 15 minutes to receive my food. Anyways, I ordered the Arroz Chaufa and my mom ordered the half chicken with fries and yuca. I also decided to get a cup of maracuya juice (my favorite) to drink, and it was very refreshing and delicious! The food was very tasty but the sauces really do make the food! My personal favorite is the yellow sauce but the green is very good as well! Overall, I recommend Viva Chicken's food to anyone, but if you're dining in remember that the place is packed!",

There is Peruvian chicken in the RTP area where I live, but this place was really fantastic.  The huge plate of my brother's chaufa came out first and I was impressed with how it looked.  Our half chicken plate with a side of fries was also fantastic.  Their fries are ridiculously good-- super unhealthy tasting and so well done.  I highly recommend.  Lastly, get the GREEN sauce!  You will want to put it on everything you ever eat.   I will come back next time I'm in Charlotte.",

Today while walking over from visiting a family member at the hospital I noticed one oft he viva chicken employees carrying over food. I was completely unaware that they deliver to the hospital. That's so great to know and hopefully, anyone that's reading this will know that for future reference. I'm not 100% sure how the process works, or if you have to meet customers at the front of the hospital. But to know they offer this service is convenient.   Ordering my meal, I wanted the fried rice with chicken and a kid-sized drink. So instead of getting a large rice which i knew i wouldn't finish, the cashier recommended that I get the kids fried rice and add veggies because it comes with a drink. This was PERFECT because I didn't want a ton of food as it was only lunchtime.   Lunchtime was super busy as exoected, but I would suggest that they had two stations that has sauces. With the location of the drinks and the sauces and this being the only location for the sauces it makes it extremly hard and takes a lot of time standing in line.",

    "text": "What to get: quarter chicken, cilantro-infused rice Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: fast casual Wait: 3 mins (Friday 4:30PM for 1) Parking: parking lot across the street  The Experience: One of the best places I got to eat while visiting Charlotte.   Parking is free and right across the street. You order at the counter and although there is a line, it moves extremely fast. I wasn't even ready when I was called up to order. Generally very clean space with two rooms to sit and eat in.  I tried the quinoa-stuffed avocado first. There were a lot of ingredients on top of both the quinoa and the avocado that I didn't really see either until I started eating. Not quite what I expected, but I loved having so much avocado at once. It's interesting to try, but I think one time is enough.  For my meal, I had a quarter chicken, cilantro-infused rice, and plantains. The chicken was juicy, tender, and flavorful. I also appreciated that it was dark meat. I was surprised by the cilantro-infused rice since I've seen other versions make the rice green, but this was more of a stir-fry with carrots and peas. I also love plantains, so you can't go wrong with those.  I ate this so fast and finished it all, which is unlike me. I honestly could have this multiple times a week and not get bored with it. I secretly wish I could get a slighter larger servings for the sides to fill the plate more, but I'm thankful for the pricing I got for the meal.  Highly recommend frequenting Viva Chicken if you're in town.",

I love the yellow sauce and the red sauce ( tongue torching, so beware!). The portion size for this dish easily serves two, so I'm able to take some home to have for a meal the next day or split it with someone! I've also tried the white meat chicken breast with sweet potato fries. Again, another great choice! I most recently tried a sandwich for the first time. This sandwich was called the Great. It is a pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread with a special mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, and onion. Though I enjoyed the sandwich, I will stick with my usual order, the arroz chaufa. If you're in the Charlotte area, there are multiple locations: Elizabeth, Concord, and Huntersville. I have been to all three... I believe they are equally great! Run, don't walk to Viva Chicken!",

While it's not the best layout for a busy restaurant, I can appreciate the excellent customer service provided. I have visited this location many times and the customer service remains warm, consistent and efficient. My order is always accurate--even when ordering online.   The food is amazing! The arroz chaufa is my favorite. Made with perfectly seasoned rice, Peruvian spiced and roasted chicken and veggies, you can not go wrong. I usually pair it with the herbal limeade....happy tastebuds abound.   A few things to consider if you are visiting during lunch: - Space is very limited; consider ordering online  - Street and lot parking available, but you could also take the street car which stops less than 1/2 block away - Enclosed patio seating available, but get there before noon",

I am very sorry for not having reviewed this wonderful place (specifically the Elizabeth location) before now, but today's efforts were Herculean.  No contest, you are my favorite go-to for catering ever.  Let me set the scene... It's 11:15am today, my director of HR comes over and says, \"Oh hai!  I totally forgot but we want lunch today for a meeting of 30 people, and we kinda don't want pizza.\"  ... Me: *blink, blink* *deep breath in, deep breath out* *send panic stricken email to Emily Ortiz (catering director at Elizabeth Viva Chicken) begging for immediate defcon 1 help.*    Knowing poor Emily is probably out delivering lunch to a ton of places who actually gave her 24 hours notice (ie: not me today), I call.  It's now 11:26am, and I get General Manager, Anthony Hartsell on the line.  He puts me on a SUPER brief hold just to ensure his kitchen can handle the excess order during (read: DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF) the lunch rush... then he comes back and says YES!!!  I get to Viva Chicken at 11:45.  I am pulling away with ALL promised food as well as all cutlery, serving-ware, plates, napkins, sauces, and a generally awesome package of necessary accoutrements and then some at 11:56pm.  I make it to my office, get it set up, and get lunch served by 12:15pm.    Dear Emily, Anthony, and your ENTIRE crew of rock stars over there, I love you.  I will forever be grateful to you for today, and you will NEVER lose my business!   To wit: May Viva Chicken forever be showered by blessings from the gods of catering!",

I ordered the 1/4 chicken and substituted my 2 sides for the recommended quinoa stuffed avocado. The chicken was juicy and tender, not dried out! It came with mild and medium sauces. LOVED them both!!! My husband had the Inca Wrap with chicken and french fries as a side. Wrap was tasty, but not as good as my roast chicken. The fries (which were recommended by the staff member) were like he said, probably the best in town! They were crunchy, not greasy at all! The food was presented beautifully and was served quickly!

No shame man, no shame.   What's cool about this place?  They are also very eco friendly!  Yay for trying to go green!  The servers are wonderful and everyone is so super nice.  When I had ordered at the register, the guy probably noticed I was a first timer and let me know about the dishes I had questions on and also informed me that they have a loyalty card.  Did I get a punch that day?  Heck yeah I did!  I plan on going back for more punches in my card!  I've definitely have to go back and try some of their chicken dishes too!",

The heart warming stuff- they work a lot with the homeless community. I cannot stress enough how incredible I find this. This makes me trust these guys. This is why local businesses are so important. They are INVOLVED in what is going on in our community.   The delicious stuff- the food is seriously good. The Quinoa stuffed avocado is a delight (IT IS HUGE). The chicken is always moist. The sauces are delicious (especially the yellow sauce). I absolutely love coming here and ordering a couple of appetizers, sides and chicken. We eat it for multiple days. IT IS AMAZING.  There is a little outdoor area that is very nicely done.  Oh- and they were open during the snow days. These people are serious about their chicken.",

    "text": "Weekday lunches, this is a packed place with a long line. You stand in line, order, and they bring the food to your table. This is that type of place.  The lunch crowd fueled by its proximity to the Paul Mitchell School, CPCC, the hospitals and numerous medical offices. Enjoyable, positive vibe inside the place.   Parking is questionable. No signs were visible as to the best place to park. Street parking (coin slot M-F) is there, and a few lots.   Having visited Peru twice, I wondered if any Peruvians would actually work there. This was answered quickly. I asked the cashier if he was Peruvian - he was. He gave me a recommendation: Quinoa-stuffed avocado with pulled chicken added.  And I was pleased to see Inca Kola available at the counter. Inca Kola is a yellow Peruvian soda tasting like cream soda which was safe to drink in Peru, and was a familiar sight anytime I sat down to eat in Peru. This soda isn't particularly wonderful. It's just that I'm a sentimental person.  I enjoyed the dish. And I was so proud at how healthy I was eating. \"Super food\" avocado plus the popular-as-ever quinoa, known for its healing powers and for empowering supernatural abilities in those who eat it. It's a good lunch. It works.  The dish included two stuffed avocados, but I was satisfied eating only one.  Cost...I don't know how to compare their prices, since I know of no such menu around town. Seemed slightly more expensive than it needs to be.",

We also ordered the taco bowl at the suggestion of the worker who took our order. We found seating outside which was quaint and beautiful with lots of plants and flowers. We had been traveling that morning and ate breakfast so we weren't incredibly hungry. But the food gave us appetite for more! The taco bowl surprised me the most, the soft rice topped with red onions, chicken, pinto beans and the side sauce for a little kick. The avocado was very filling though we got it as an appetizer - it could probably be a meal for one. Everything was delicious, customer service was great. Five stars in our book! :-)",

    "text": "Viva la chicken, viva la life! This fast casual style restaurant is a healthier, tastier alternative to the other mass produced crap you can find in any major American city. It is in a trendy location with a trendy interior that offers clean inside and outside seating if you don't want to take your food to go.  Ordering is quick and simple and service is even quicker. I ordered a quarter chicken with sweet plantains and chicken soup as the sides. The chicken soup was an interesting take on a classic. It was chock full of vegetables with very tender chicken and a hearty broth, but something missed the mark. Maybe it was a lack of grain that took away from the more traditional chicken noodle soup I am used to. The plantains were average, but the rotisserie chicken was above average. The skin was crispy, not really oily or overly fatty like many other chicken restaurants. It was spiced well and the meat fell tenderly off of the bone. Definitely one of the better rotisserie chickens I have ever consumed but you do get what you pay for and it is more expensive then what you can find somewhere else. Their signature sauces are an added bonus to the meal. Their mild sauce (with hints of garlic and a touch of heat) was the best. I did not try their medium (some sort of green sauce) and their hot was comparable to medium sauces at most other places. It lacked the dynamic flavor that the mild sauce had.  My girlfriend ordered the quinoa stuffed avocado with an added portion of chicken. It is definitely one of the more unique items on the menu and I was taken aback when it was served. They really do put a full avocado on the plate and they dress it nicely with their signature sauce and chicken. My girlfriend greatly enjoyed this healthy eating option, but for someone like me who is not very partial to large doses of avocado it was very overpowering.  If I lived in the area, I could see this restaurant becoming a go-to favorite for a healthy take out meal option.",

    "text": "First tried Viva Chicken as takeout at my job - we had it several times over the course of two months and let me tell you, everyone I work with adores Viva Chicken.  I went to the actual restaurant location last Saturday (wanted my mom to try it) and was even more pleased.  It is a little bit of a hike for me since I live in the Ballantyne area, but it was worth it!  I haven't branched out to multiple menu items (not yet!) because I typically stick to the rotisserie chicken and two sides whenever I order.  Viva Chicken is so delicious though and knowing that I'm going to partake in their tastiness usually improves my day drastically :)  I order the chicken with fruit (trying to be somewhat healthy) and fried yucca (yeah, there goes the healthy).  I haven't had good fried yucca since I ate Cuban food in Key West, but Viva nailed it - delicous and creamy with lightly salted and crispy exterior.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, with signature moisture.  My mom had the cilantro rice and of course we poured their signature sauces (green and yellow) over everything.  I enjoy it so much, I think I even dipped the fruit in it.  We finished the meal off with some cookies that I cannot remember the name of - sort of like really soft shortbread with powdered sugar on it and sandwiching some nutella like sauce - also amazing.  Service was prompt and polite and several times, people came over to ask if the food was good and to refill water/take plates away, etc.  Everyone there seemed happy to be there, which made for a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere.  In my opinion, this place is a gem!  Some people might think it is a little pricey, but we paid around twenty bucks for our meals - keep in mind this is a hefty portion of chicken, breast and leg meat with a hearty helping of sides as well - so I thought the price was fair.  I feel like I can't go out to eat for 2 people without spending close to twenty bucks these days anyway and with far less satisfaction than I had at Viva Chicken.  And I am very excited to report that I was told they are potentially opening a location in Ballantyne!  Woo hoo!  I might never cook again!",

Thanks.)  Walking in, it was busy with noticeably diverse customers. Queens University students, a few families, doctors, 3 hipsters, an elderly women's book club, some Wells Fargo employees. Don't know why that is noteworthy but it was noticeable; perhaps speaks to the wide market the place serves. Let's go with that.  Chipotle-y layout, plus a nice enclosed shaded patio. Approached cashier, who seemed new but was doing her best and was cheery & pleasant. (She recorded my name completely wrong. After a worker called throughout the restaurant for \"Savannah\" with the order, I figured as much.) Ordered a side of yuca fries. $3.90 or so. Ready in less than 5 minutes. Marvelous. Perfect. Fresh, thick and crispy, and the sauce was a perfect match. Yuca bet I'll be back.",

    "text": "Viva Chicken! Yes Long Live the Chicken! This Peruvian style cuisine fits the idea of great seasoning without the spice. Chicken is flavourful and embodies a richness of moisture and is well cooked. On the other hand, if you have spicy palate like myself you may want to order this chicken to go. The spicy condiments provided are 3 varieties of spice, but if you consider spice to be filled with a habanero, Scotch bonnet, or a ghost pepper then the 3 spices offered are not for you.  The Yucca (Cassava) fries are my favourite thing next to the chicken. It is crisp, crunchy on the outside and has soft inside.  After every bite, I felt I had both fried and boiled yucca (cassava).  Alfajore cookies should be made a tad bit similar with a high quantity. That would preserve a bit of authenticity to the cookies. Although, I know this place is sort of a fast food Peruvian spot.  Salad balsamic dressing has a sweet taste and bite sour bite to it. It is mostly cabbage, onions and tomatoes with cucumber. Juices are pretty extremely sweet, I found myself consistently mixing it with water.   Outdoor Patio area is a terrific place to get work done with a nice beer!",

I have been here twice and ordered the Wow Lomito each time.  WOW is right! This twist on the steak sandwich works well on many levels.  The ciabatta bread is soft and warm (wouldn't work the same if it was cold and/or hard).  The steak has a wonderful, light, grilled smoky flavor to it and the onions and tomato are the perfect complement.  You can't forget to add cheese and avocado as well!  We're talking down right, good food y'all!  My roommate is fond of ordering the 1/2 chicken with two sides for $11.50.  I've tasted it several times and I can also give this menu item my certified stamped of approval.  You can't believe how tasty this all-natural, free range, rotisserie chicken is.  This isn't what you pick-up at the Teeter or Food Lion.   You can tell a lot of love and time has been put into each chicken they serve.     It is a welcomed addition to the Elizabeth area of Charlotte.  I plan to continue to patronize Viva and hope to continue to explore this vast and unique menu.",

    "text": "The food here is soooooo good, but man do they need to work on getting their pickup orders right. Considering the taste of all of the food here and the kind staff at this place I wouldn't hesitate giving this place 5 or more stars. But I did have to dock it 1 star since the last 2 times Ive picked up takeout from here I got it home to realize it wasn't the correct order. Perhaps getting sandwiches for takeout versus just chicken and sides makes it too complicated for the folks that put the takeout orders together.   For the past couple of years of getting takeout ( and eat in) from this place I have never had an issue until the last month or so. About a month ago I ordered the naked peruvian sandwich with steak on ciabatta etc. When I got it back to the house the sandwich only had steak onions and tomatoes on it. I was so disappointed (since what I actually ordered is super yum) that I called in to the store. They didn't hesitate in offering me a corrected sandwich if I wanted to come back in or a credit for the one I ordered and paid for the next time I went in. I took the latter option since I was already in my comfy clothes in front of a movie at home. That couldn't have been any more painless.  Fast forward a month to last night when I got take out again. Called in on the way to place the order. We were planning on getting the sandwich we had a credit for and 2 orders of the quinoa stuffed avocado....I mean we all love those right?! We called in and the guy on the other end of the phone told me the worst news I had heard all day ....\"WE ARE OUT OF THE QUINOA STUFFED AVOCADOS\". Those words echoed in my head like a nightmare that would never end. What was I to do? How could I go on (with my order)? We settled for 2 of the naked peruvians. One with steak and one with pulled chicken, both with the bean soup, 2 herbal lemonades (liquid heaven) and a tres leche cake. We checked it when got in the car to make sure everything was there and it appeared to be that it was right and we had 2 naked peruvians, but when we got it home we noticed both the sandwiches had steak...no pulled chicken in sight. Didn't have the energy or balls to call again but considering the list they had for credits this isn't too rare of an occurrence. Both times the receipt said the correct order so had to have just been made wrong. Oh well...food sure was delicious though, as always.  One more gripe/compliment combo to throw in to the mix. Consider this a plea if you would like to. But why in the world would they get rid of the passionfruit mousse? That stuff was so friggin good. Please bring it back!! Ive tried all the other desserts at this point and while good they don't come close to the passionfruit mousse. Hear my cries.",

My go to is the polla a la brasa, cilantro rice, and side salad! Loved the plantains as well! On days where I want something different, I'll go with the stuffed avocados. I tried the Inca wrap twice thinking I would like it better the second time, however something is off for me (maybe the amount of onions?) but, hey, you might love it. If you're looking for something sweet, the churros are amazing!   Workers were friendly, although service might be a bit slow, especially around lunch rush. I bypass all of that just by ordering online! Definitely worth giving this place a try!",

    "text": "I brought my parents to Viva Chicken in Elizabeth on a Saturday for lunch. We ordered a whole chicken to share, which comes with three sides. We selected the cilantro rice, canary beans, and plantains. After seating ourselves, we treated ourselves to the sauce bar, and waited only a few moments for our meal to be delivered.   Our chicken was presented to the table in a paper-lined basket, and our sides in family-sized bowls. The rice was perfect and was the first thing to disappear from each of our plates. Very tasty. The canary beans were flavorful and had a slight heat to them. The plantains were excellent, but I wish there were twice as many! Note to self: grab a double-order of plantains next time.   The chicken was unreal. Served at the perfect temperature, it fell apart with hardly any effort when digging in with a fork. The seasoning was generous and mouthwatering. My father is watching his diet and as I watched him remove the skin from his portion of the chicken, I quickly snatched it up to enjoy for myself. So good.   I chose Chicha Morada for my drink, and it was delightful. The menu lists it as a drink made from Peruvian Purple Corn, Cinnamon, Clove, Pineapple, Apple, and Lime. It's a beautiful rich purple color. The drink teetered on the edge of being too sweet, but the spicy and fruity flavor perfectly complimented the savory chicken and sides. I'd order this again in a heartbeat. The cinnamon and clove make me feel as though it would be especially enjoyable in the wintertime.  While it was very busy during our visit, we received exceptional service. Everyone we encountered was kind, helpful, and engaged with their work.   My only complaint -- and I understand it's not specific to this location -- is the disposable plates and utensils. Granted, they're not cheap, flimsy pieces, but it would take a wonderful meal to the next level to enjoy it on a real plate with actual silverware.   After winning my folks over with such a great experience, I know we'll be back. Extra plantains for me.",

I decided to visit after lunch because of how packed it usually is but I guess the staff mentally zones out after lunch too. When I walked in I was puzzled to where to order and even what to get. With no assistance I looked for a menus and began to search for something to order.  The girl behind the cash register wasn't really any help on what to order when I asked, so I ended ordering the 1/4 Chicken, Cilantro rice and fries. Let's just say it was very bland with no type of flavor at all. I was very disappointed being that the customer service atmosphere was sub-par. I was really hoping that the food was going to be great.   I did order a drink as well and they didn't even have the sweet tea filled up. As I left I notice an older gentleman greeting people and asking them do they \"need assistance on the menu.\" I thought to myself \"where was this service when I walked in!\" I guess I caught them on a bad day for first impressions.",

I don't know how they can mess up that bad, I had to drive all the way back (about 20 mins) to get my correct order and they had me wait about 15 minutes to give me my order and they just came out with rice and fries and not a brand new plate. When I asked for fresh steak too (because by now my steak is cold), the cashier took my old steak as she rolled her eyes and threw it away and told the cook to make new steak too and had to wait about 45 mins for that. That was enough for me to say I'm NEVER coming back.",

I ordered The Great sandwich: rotisserie chicken with lettuce tomato and onion on ciabatta bread with special mayonnaise. Absolutely delicious! The bread was the absolute best choice, in my opinion, and was recommended to me by the cashier (over the wrap). My friend who has been dining here for years has never tried the sandwich; she tasted mine and said she will be ordering it next time.   I chose the Peruvian beans as my side that comes with the sandwich. They were definitely good, though I am not a beans person (so I don't know why I picked it). If this is what you're craving, good choice; otherwise, I might suggest another one of their side options instead such as the plaintains, yuca, rice, or sweet potato fries.   My friend ordered the arroz chaufa which is fried rice with vegetable mix-ins. She also adds pulled rotisserie chicken. Yum! It is her favorite dish, and she gets it every time. I tasted it and loved it. Would order it, for sure.  Of note, I personally highly dislike cilantro (I know; I'm weird) which really limits my food choices at this place. I thought about ordering the chicken soup until I saw it was made with cilantro-infused rice. For those who love cilantro, I'm sure anything on the menu would be a great pick!  I saw another customer have an order of the quinoa stuffed avocados. Wow, they looked amazing. I've heard they are one of the best menu items. Definitely intend to try some time.  When the food was brought to our table, an employee asked whether he could do anything else for us. After noticing we did not have any utensils, he brought those over along with extra napkins. We were asked by another employee later during our dining experience whether she could help us in any way. The staff here were fantastic!  Lastly, the place is clean, open, and inviting. Even the restroom was extremely clean. 10/10 would recommend this Viva Chicken location to anyone in char",

Whatever you want to call it, they have things that you won't find just about anywhere else (sure, Pio Pio counts but you aren't likely to see them on the menu at Bojangles anytime soon).  Some of that tasty Peruvian Chicken? Quinoa? Avocados? All of the above? Yes please, and how about we call it a Naked Peruvian? Well, I don't know... what the heck, let's go with it.  Perhaps the best thing - other than that tasty yellow sauce that I could bathe in if those little plastic cups were not so small - is that the staff is so friendly, from the cashiers who help with understanding what all the items are on the menu, to the people wandering the floor who help you with a clean table, keep the glasses full, and even pick up your dirty dishes. It's pretty darn close to a full-service restaurant, but it moves way faster.  This is especially important at this location, and even more so at lunch, with the hospital crowd and college crowd nearby, because that line can get loooong.",

    "text": "I love me some Viva Chicken! Haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't good! And the sauce bar just makes all the good food even better. My go to is usually the INCA Wrap add pulled rotisserie chicken, it's filled with cilantro infused rice, canary beans, salsa criolla (lime marinated onions and tomatoes), and avocado. Then I get the green beans and plantains. But let me tell you I'm not even a huge green bean fan but their green beans I sometimes crave! To finish my order I can't forget the Maracuya (Passion Fruit Juice) it is absolutely everything, yes I've been here and only ordered that before (I had already ate tho or else the smells would have taken over and I would have ate too). But you really can't go wrong here, the rotisserie chicken is delicious and the quinoa stuffed avocado is so bomb and add chicken to that as well.",

Places that everyone rants and raves about and so you just can't wait to try it and ultimately you're disappointed.    Viva Chicken is not one of those places.   The chicken is cooked beautifully, moist and delicious throughout every bite.  I thought the yellow sauce was my favorite, as that was the first one I tried, until a coworker turned me onto the green sauce.  My goodness.  Spicy and delicious.  Definitely my go-to from then on.    And that's not to even get me started on the perfectly cooked fried plantains, the moist delicious rice and the signature quinoa stuffed avocados.  Seriously, if you plan on going and not ordering the avocado; stay home.   This place is great; go try it soon.",

Quick and friendly service. They offered refills on my water a couple of time while I sat in the patio.  The food was hot, fresh & seasoned to perfection. The free side sauces they offer next to the soda machine are excellent. How do I invest in this restaurant?

There was a green and a peach colored one. The cashier was nice enough for me to sample both and she suggested they are good mixed. She was right!

Appreciate that they have a couple of vegan options and/or ways to make something vegan -- even though they aren't a vegan establishment. 3. While the non-vegans I dined with loved the cuisine, mine was just ok. The Inca Wrap was good...but I personally don't care for carrots & peas in my rice (yes, even though I'm vegan). 4. Last, but definitely not least, THE SERVICE WAS AMAZING! One girl helped right when we got in -- noticing that we had a baby with us. Made sure we snatched a table for 4, and brought us over a high chair. The bussers were there every time we turned around -- making sure everything tasted fine, cleared our plates, and grabbed us a to-go box. And I wanted to give a shoutout to Juan at the register. I told him I was vegan after placing my order, so he went through the individual ingredients to make sure they were all vegan...and recommended a side he knew was vegan...all with a smile on his face. :) So thanks, Juan!",

I got a side salad which was awesome (the balsamic dressing is amazing) and the white rice. They have a cilantro infused rice that I heard others order  but I am not a cilantro fan.    What made this place stand out the best is the service. I was thrown off a little at first because when you order you walk up to a counter and get a number and sit down, food is delivered and that's it. Not here the staff regularly walks around offering to refill drinks, get you a spoon and take your plate when you are finished. I also like the fact that most their paper and plastic products are recycled or are compostable.

Order at the counter,  eat out of paper plates with plastic utensils - they SUCK for carving roasted chicken- and....go, leave, please don't forget to clean after yourself!  In my book this type of establishment doesn't even qualify as a restaurant. Got no clue why people like places like these, assembly lines meant to get customers in and out asap, period.    As for the menu ... well no seafood whatsoever, none - which is funny because seafood is really what makes Peruvian food shine and so different from it's neighbors. The chicken was an OK plump \"Peruvian flavored\" chicken, but not the best while everything else was totally Americanized.   Normally the green hot sauce is so hot that I can only use small dabs of it, here they call it \"medium hot\" and I could gulp it by the spoonful. In fact I dumped the whole container on top of the tasteless Canary beans in order to be able to eat them.  The \"hot\" red sauce (aka \"gringo killer\" ) was mildly hot, not bad it went well with the chicken but it tasted a lot more like a hot BBQ than anything Peruvian. The sweet potato fries, again not bad but 100% American.  Not saying this place is bad, but it's like ordering from Pizza Hut, then claiming you've experienced great Italian cuisine.",

I've had the half chicken with the chicken soup and the cilantro rice. I've had the yuca fries, regular fries, house salad, bean soup,fried rice... omg I can go on and on! The sauces are awesome although I've only had the mild and medium (yellow & green) sauces. I put that $hIt on everything! I've started mixing the yellow and green sauce together to make a perfect sauce. Anyhoots try it you cannot go wrong!",

    "text": "I am ever-passionate about Peruvian chicken. I grew up eating the tenderly roasted delicacy and consider myself a True pollo rico fan. While I'm more accustomed to authentic, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, I was pleasantly surprised by the Viva Chicken approach.   Seemingly out of a cool California operation, with its eco-chic interior and practices. Celebrating sustainable and recyclable practices, Viva seems to care about its impact on the environment and clearly has a heart too. On a select weekday night, they'll feed someone in need for free.    To acquire some of the best chicken you're bound to ever eat, simply place your order at the counter and then patiently wait for your take out or dine in (should you choose to stick around, there's indoor and patio seating available). I opted for the pollo a la brasa (1/4 white meat) and 2 sides (cilantro infused rice with canary beans). While it plays host to fast food ordering, the dishes taste anything but rushed. For a mere $7.95, I dove in to my meal and compare it to the best of places I've visited. Were I to call myself a Charlotte resident, Viva would be in regular rotation.",

I always order the quinoa-stuffed avocado (a must try if you haven't had it!) with a side house salad.  The first time, my avocado arrived with chicken and had to be sent back.  The second time, I received a salad with chicken (no avocado or house salad).  The third time (which happened yesterday, 5/19), I placed an order online for pick up that, according to the confirmation email I received, was to be ready at 12:44pm.  I arrived at 1pm to pick it up, and the order had been lost.  I showed the email to the staff at the register.  I did not receive an apology from the staff, all I was told was that the kitchen was backed up and that they would try to push the order through.  I received it ten minutes later.    Will I go back?  Probably, because I love the avocado.  In the meantime, I think I will be taking a break so hopefully I'll have better luck next time.",

I have eaten here twice tried things similar to I would get at Pio and just have not been impressed. The sauces, the chicken, the drinks I would prefer to eat at it's competitor.  Easiest way to put it, this is a 3 start place and Pio Pio is 5 stars.",

    "text": "When looking for a lunch or dinner option that's out of the box and packed with fresh flavors from South of the border, not to mention easy on the budget and the schedule, Viva has become my new go-to.  The focus is on rotisserie-style chicken made in-house.  The outside is covered in seasoning and cooked to near fall-off-the-bone perfection.  And then you get your choice of sauces, all made on-premises, that are each show-stoppers in their own right.  One creamy with just the hint of a spice kick, one packed with diced cilantro, and another red with the chili pepper base and a smoky flavor with a just a bit of kick at the end.  All 3 very different, but somehow each work perfect with the chicken.  Most meals also come with a choice of sides, which are anything but an afterthought here.  Rice seasoned with cilantro, beans modestly spiced with a cumin and other herbs, and even a small green salad with red onion and a balsamic vineagrette all show the kitchen's skill and focus on flavor.  Even the regular fries and the sweet-potato fries are elevated due to a coating that makes them particularly crunchy upon presentation.  The same can be said for the fried yucca.  A great alternative to the fries, these wedges have a slightly sweet and earth flavor that pairs well with creamy sauce.  I've also found the sweet plantains to be well done here, with just the right consistency, not too mushy and not too firm.    This is not to say the other menu offerings are second-class citizens, however.  The Lomolito sandwich is quite nice, for example.  Thin strips of seasoned stake and vegetables are served an a super fresh roll that finds the right balance between crunch and chew.  Vegans and vegetarians can rejoice with the other options here, including the uber-healthy avocado stuffed with quinoa.    I also like the restaurant's decidedly green focus, using compost friendly plates and utensils while also making an effort to separate the trash to increase recyclables.  Even the patio in the back is earth-friendly, with hanging gardens of herbs and flowering plants.  The only ding I can find here is the music.  It's a constant club dance mix that's just a tad too loud, especially at lunch time.  While it is lively, its a little off-putting for a mostly-business lunch crowd.  Still, it's worth the fist-pumping beats to chow down on some of the best fast-fare you can find within earshot of uptown.  The quality is all there and the flavor quality is superb.  Here's to hoping for a very long life for Viva, a great addition to the neighborhood.",

I stopped into viva chicken because I was going to a concert at Visualite theatre, which is about a 30 second walk away, so convenience was a huge plus for me. There is nearby parking of the street is full, just drove around the block and you're sure to find one of the lots you can use.  I ordered a quarter chicken with the mild sauce, yucca, and canary beans. I didn't care for the yucca, which I would blame on personal tastes, but from what my friends who lived in South America said about it, it actually wasn't prepared particularly well, so take that for what you will.   The chicken and canary beans, on the other hand, were amazing. The mild sauce had a wonderful taste to it, but even the chicken with no sauce would've been great. I'm not sure what all was included in the beans, but they were also great.",

I tend to order the great sandwich- add provolone and add avocado, with fries. I love this meal and it will always be a favorite of mine since it was the first real food I had after giving birth to my baby girl.   My husband has ordered several other menu items, including the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado, which looked delicious and he confirmed it was and his favorite lately has been the Classic Saltado which is a delicious combo of beef, fries and rice. i have tried this and truly enjoy it- but still like to get the same sandwich b/c I am such a creature of habit.   Eating in has always been a pleasure as everyone we have encountered who works here has been super nice and helpful. I really like that all of the products they use are eco-friendly as it seems so many places tend to use Styrofoam and i am all about saving the planet and all that jazz.   Now that I have written this review I will have to remember to go there again soon.",

Incredibly nice servers asked us if we had been there before, they suggested I sample some fresh juice, and made recommendations on their specialties.   As mentioned below, Viva has a fast-food set-up but the food is fresh and lovingly prepared. I went with \"The Great\" sandwich with avocado and plantains and my husband went with the pork sandwich La Butifarra with sweet potato fries. The sandwiches are served on the best Ciabatta I've ever had (soft on the inside light and crisp on the outside). My husband's sandwich was the better of the two, but both were exceptionally good. The meat very much has that distinct wood-fired flavor that when combined with the sauces, veggies, and bread is heavenly. My plantains were nice and caramelized - I would definitely order them again next time.   They are very eco-conscious here and surprisingly have a large selection of veg-friendly options (I counted 8). They also have a lot of Asian inspired dishes which I can't wait to try.   The outdoor area would make a great place to grab a bite to eat with a friend/date, it also is completely covered in herbs/plants which makes for a very cool vibe. The only tiny suggestion I would make is to turn the techno-beats a tad down during the lunch hour.   My hubby and I both agreed we can't wait to return for another one of those mouth-watering sandwiches. SO GOOD!",

I had the quinoa-stuffed avocados. They were great - the bland mayonnaise sauce they were topped with was gross.   I tried all three of the sauces. The best is the mild (green). The medium (yellow) was greasy and loaded with mayonnaise, we couldn't stomach more than a bite. The \"gringo-killer\" hot (orange) sauce had a bit of a kick but plenty more mayonnaise limited its appeal.  The chicken was fine.   The plantains were decent, but tasted like it had been in a steamer tray for a while before being served.   The restaurant is self service with adult beverages and a nice selection of house made juices. They use compostable dinnerware which is cool.",

The chicken is moist, juicy and savory. The outside is cooked to perfection as well. Taking some if the chicken in a sauce and some white rice is the perfect flavor combination. They also have cilantro rice which sounds delicious but I haven't tried it yet.   The plantains I had were quite possibly the best I've ever had. Soft and sweet on the inside and crusty and sugary on the outside. It's not even fair how good they are. I've heard their fried yucca is amazing too; I believe it after eating their food. Seems like they're on point with everything.",

    "text": "I LOVE this place! Before coming here, I had not had Peruvian Food. But, how can you go wrong with rotisserie chicken? I usually get the 1/4 chicken and vary the sides. It is always enough food for me and I'm a pretty sizable guy. However, there is always the 1/2 chicken too if you are really famished. The two sauces (I only know them as green and yellow) are both delicious and unique. Great for dipping chicken or fries into or pouring over your rice. The stuffed avocados with chicken are incredible and worthy of an appetizer to try or get two and make it a meal.  Now, here is why I give them five stars. I came one time with my family and my mum brought her guide dog. They asked a few questions regarding the dog being in the restaurant. Being protected by the ADA and having several non-accommodating encounters over the years, we were not in the mood for a fight and politely but abruptly answered their questions and then went to sit down. A few minutes later they brought out a dog dish with water and gave us two treats for the dog for later because they understood he was working. We were blown away. Their questions, while bizarre in presentation, were actually trying to determine if it was appropriate to give the dog a treat. In 32 years, I cannot think of one restaurant that has ever done that for my mum. I have been in several where they just pet the dog without asking or try to secretly throw it a scrap or sit us out of the way or flat out try to refuse service. But never this.  And their customer service did not just shine then. Every time I've been in there, the staff is friendly, and seems to always do at least one thing that I'd consider above and beyond most places.  I'd go back for their food alone, but they are one of those places that simply deserve to be a lifelong staple n the Charlotte restaurant community.",

    "text": "I've been here five or six times, and I've loved it each visit. The 1/4 chicken is good, and I've enjoyed the fries, canary beans and cilantro rice as sides. All white meat is .75 cent upcharge, which is worth it. The green sauce (Huacatay Sauce) is good, but too spicy for my tastes. I recently tried the yellow sauce (mild, Aji Amarillo) and I'm mad at myself for not trying it earlier because it is yummy.   My favorite dish is the Arroz Chaufa (fried rice) with chicken. The Viva Tacu Bowl is good too, think like a Chipotle burrito bowl, but I wouldn't order it again because the canary beans got to be too spicy for me. I've only tried their Herbal Lemonade specialty drink, and it is cool and refreshing. I tried their lunch special today (the 1/4 chicken with 1 side and drink for $5.95) and it was a great deal! My sister tried their the Great rotisserie chicken sandwich yesterday and loved it.   I will definitely come back to Viva Chicken often and try out the rest of their menu. I highly recommend this place, and it's wonderful they are opening a 2nd location in Ballantyne.",

There is a patio that looks out to a parking lot, but you wouldn't notice because the sides are surrounded by clever planters suspended in front of the non view. It the temperatures are pleasant, outside is where you want to be. Now the food. Yum! Marinated Peruvian style chicken is the highlight of the menu. Your choice of whole , half or quarter chicken & sides. I got a quarter chicken because I wanted the appetizer too. The appetizer I chose was a composition of chicken salad covered with yumminess & garnishes. I think brides should have it instead of wedding cake. Lovely to look at & livelier to eat. The sides that we had were infuses rice, beans green beans (get this! So good!), & plantain chips. The beverages are worth a trip in themselves. 3 house specifies plus sangria, fountain drinks & beer. I only regret I didn't have room for dessert. They looked delicious. You should eat here and try everything.",

We had the 1/2 avocado appetizer to start. I had The Great pulled chicken sandwich with extra avocado and a side of fries. My wife had the 1/4 chicken with cilantro rice and green beans. Food:  very good We were happy we choose to order the 1/2 avocado appetizer. Since there were only two of us it was the perfect size.  We thought it was good not great. My chicken sandwich was good; but a little on the dry side.  The fries were very good.   The 1/4 chicken was also a little dry; but still had a good taste.  The rice was very good.  The green beans were our favorite. They were grilled and had a lot of flavor. Service.  We were disappointed by the service.  At the Ballentyne restaurant we received great service. At this location it truly felt like we were in a fast food restaurant. Overall I thought it was a good meal; but next time I will take the extra few minutes and drive to Ballentyne.",

    "text": "After seeing such high ratings and good reviews everywhere, I was definitely left disappointed after my visit. Maybe I had too high of expectations, but nothing seemed special at all in my recent visit.  I ordered a quarter chicken with fried yuca and sweet plantains as my two sides. The rotisserie chicken was very juicy and you could tell it hadn't been sitting around in a warmer or anything, but it didn't have a lot of flavor overall. The sauces were great, however. The aji amarillo (yellow) sauce was excellent, very salty but with flavors I couldn't quite put my finger on. The huacatay sauce (green) had a strong cilantro and mint flavor and a decent bit of kick; it was slightly similar to salsa verde and I really enjoyed it as well. The fried yuca was almost like a slightly larger potato fry, and they were fried perfectly. There was almost no seasoning or salt on them though, so they definitely had to be dipped in one of the sauces (but the sauces are awesome so I probably would have anyway). The fried plantains were a huge letdown for me. They looked awesome but they were undercooked and were still very tough and chewy. They were also a bit sweeter than I expected.  Overall the chicken and yuca were decent but really needed the sauces to be good, and I did not care for the plantains at all. I was also a bit disappointed in the portions. I received 4 yuca fries and 4 pieces of plantains, not to mention 1/4 chicken isn't really that much meat. I was also really let down by the time it took to get my food- exactly 20 minutes. I understand that it was in the peak of the lunch rush, but the gentleman at the table next to me complained to the manager because his food had taken almost 25 minutes.",

Prior to walking in the delicious aroma of this place swirls around you outside and sweeps you into the restaurant.  I had the 1/2 chicken meal with fried plantains and sweet potato fries.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  If I had a complaint it would be that it was so much food, but let's be honest that's not really a valid complaint.  The plantains reminded me of when I visited Belize and tasted very similar.  I can't wait to come back and try the stuffed avocados!",

Here comes the food, herb grilled rotisserie chicken with plantains and cilantro rice.

The plantains were awesome and extra fresh!  I didn't try the green beans. The best part of Viva Chicken were the sauces!  I loved the Roasted Rococo sauce mixed in the Arroz Chaufa.  I was so impressed with the food that I went back the next day and got the same thing for lunch and ate half of it that day and left the rest for the next day.  Ok...so I may be a little addicted but I'm sure it will die down eventually.",

I was surprised to find that the food here was very comparable! We ordered a whole chicken and 3 sides (yuca fries, quinoa and salad) between two people. The portions were huge, we ate our fill and had some to take to-go. The salad wasn't worth getting but their chicken was so very delicious. They also had all the great classic sauces (not sure the names- but the green one and the yellow one!). The place was very busy and crowded. I would probably choose to take my food to-go next time! but the server was also very courteous. Overall, really great food and I'll definitely be back!",

So glad we finally tried Viva and immediately felt remorse for not trying it out till yesterday, lol. The chicken is cooked perfectly ( please replace 'perfectly' with a better word, if you know one). we ordered all white meat and expecting the breast part might be a little dry (like most other rotisserie chicken) but to our surprise it was super juicy and came right off the bones.  Also the chicken breast size was normal and not too big ( I hope that's becoz they use all natural chicken and not ones grown feeding hormones for extra weight/fat).  The skin was perfectly charred and loved the taste of it, whatever spices that are rubbed on it - is just perfect. THIS IS our new go-to place for some yummy roasted chicken going forward. The sides - fried plantains were super delicious and with that hot sauce it was too damn delicious.  Chicken soup was just amazing, loved the taste (a lil bit salty) but loved it.  Even their sauce is magic, we took the hot sauce and it was god damn delicious. perfect touch to their yummy, delicious, soft, juicy Rotisserie. Now have to try the other items on their menu ;)",

Judging by the volume of people in the restaurant, it appears we were not the only ones who had this in mind! The takeaway is simple open-pit concept cooking that creates savory meals at a decent price.  When we walked in we were greeted by a wonderful aroma and the view of a 6' long rotisserie fire pit working it's magic on what was soon to become my next meal. I ordered the 1/4 chicken with a side of chicken soup and my wife ordered a quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection. Both my main and side dish were very simple, but packed a ton of flavor. My wife's dish had a few more ingredients, and packed even more flavor. Whatever you do, don't forget to grab the sauce. Even if you have a thing against condiments (it's OK, I will only judge you a little bit), this will take your meal to the next level. I recommend getting all three sauces as each has it's own unique flavor.   I see the appeal of having this as a grab-and-go lunch place, but they do have a fair amount of indoor and patio seating so don't be afraid to eat in. I enjoyed both the concept and the resulting meal, and based on the menu, I can't see you going wrong with any of the choices. I definitely plan on coming back!",

We got a side of plantains and yuca which came with a creamy queso fresco sauce. Everything was good but the only complaints we have are that the fries were cold. For me, the Yuca tasted weird.

We ate here for lunch and had the chicken, rice, and avocado.  It was the best rice and chicken I've ever had and I frequent five star restaurants!   The seasoning and marinade on the chicken are superb as are the flavors in the rice.  I will pay for that rice recipe!   :)  Again, delicious food and please open a restaurant in California!",

I'd give this place 4 stars if they served more of a plant-based variety!",

We took my husband here for his birthday because it's become our go-to spot for healthy, flavorful comfort food and it has never disappointed. NEVER.  Between us we've tried almost everything on the menu and each have our favorites. Arroz Chaufa is his, usually with chicken, and the stuffed avocado with quinoa is probably mine, though I would walk a mile through snow in bare feet to get to a fresh order of their plantains. He's also returned several times to the traditional saltado.  Then there are the sauces. Holy crow, the sauces.  What he does - and I started doing - when he gets the Arroz Chaufa is to put a stripe of each of the three sauces across the top of the dish so you can mix the flavors if you want or enjoy them separately. My favorite is the yellow sauce, his the green. If you get takeout, be sure to hit the sauce bar to get extra before you leave.",

The rice was sticky, as in slightly overcooked so that was a bit disappointing but it wasn't terrible. The plantain was tasty.  I enjoyed the assortment of sauces available.  The restaurant (including the bathrooms) was super clean. The staff was friendly which is always a plus to me!  I wasn't blown away but I had a very pleasant experience nonetheless and would love to go back to try some of the other menu items.",

Everything tasted fresh, lightly dressed and delicious! It's an order, get a number and seat yourself type of place... with EXCEPTIONAL service! The servers that deliver the food to your table politely smiling and in a non-rushed manner ask if there's anything you need. There were also 2 other employees (one may have been a manager) that asked if we needed anything. I don't get that kind of service at a formal dining experience. We were so happy and will be headed back every weekend!",

    "text": "Viva Chicken may be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte right now. The ingredients are so perfectly paired with one another and the atmosphere is light and modern. I've had two different things and the one I vouch for is the chicken taco bowel with avocado and a side of the spicy green sauce. Wow! I'm in love! It's a layer of rice, beans, moist chicken, and cilantro onions and tomatoes and I usually add avocado too. I think it's about $11 after you add chicken and avocado which for lunch I think is a great deal.   I also got the quinoa stuffed avocados and they were delicious but I didn't like all the spicy mayo on top. I'm not a mayo fan though so that's probably why.   The owner is a sweetie always helping and inquiring after his customers and the staff is receptive, timely, and helpful.  I also love all the plates and silverware can be recycled.",

    "text": "We didn't feel like cooking, but we wanted something relatively close. I was actually searching Yelp for someplace that served a killer salad, and the first result was Viva Chicken. So...  The place is smaller than I thought, though the outdoor seating was closed for winter. At first glance, the menu looks a bit limited, but there's actually a good bit of variety. We got a whiff of the chicken and I decided that a salad would have to wait for another time.  We considered the quinoa avocado simply because it looked great, but my wife dislikes the peppers and I'm not a big avocado guy. We both decided on the quarter chicken (white meat) and two sides. She got the cilantro rice and yucca, and I had the plantains and green beans.  The plates, utensils - pretty much everything - is biodegradable or Eco-friendly. Which is great. Except the forks are a bit flimsy. Found it hard to wrangle the green beans... Our meals were brought to our table.  There is also a sauce bar, of a sort. We both went with the mild, garlicky stuff and it was strong and tasty. The chicken is Peruvian rotisserie style and has a unique, lively flavor without being spicy. Very very tasty, both the meat and the skin. My wife enjoyed the rice, but was smitten with the yucca. I found the plantains sweet, which made us wonder if they were fresh. They were good, though. The green beans were pretty good too, especially with the garlic sauce.  My wife had water. I sampled the herb lemonade, and liked it enough to order it. It was very strong and flavorful as well as refreshing. Could do with a bit more tanginess, but that's my opinion. I quite liked it as it was, and am picking nits.  The portions were fine, but we did think it was just ever-so-slightly more expensive than we expected. Our meal came in just under $25 for the two of us, but the food was excellent. And we were not alone. The other restaurant in the same building was nearly empty, while Viva Chicken was jumping. And the food certainly deserves the attention. Recommended for anyone in the area of CPCC or if you're in Uptown and don't mind a jaunt. Note that the streetcar stops right next to the place.",

LOCATION Near CPCC, next to Earl's Grocery right on the \"trolley\" line. There is plenty of parking across the street. Don't be a noob and go for the side parking. If your car is even slightly past the white line, you will get a ticket.. plus, why would you want to pay for parking?   AMBIENCE Feels like a Peruvian Chipotle... except that you don't actually get to choose every ingredient that goes into your dish. There is seating enough for about ~50 people including the \"greenhouse\" area... but it does get very crowded. Try to avoid dining in during lunch and evening hours.   FOOD We like everything. It's all yummy. If it's your first visit, try the 1/4 chicken plate. That's a must. Try all three sauces (none of them aren't spicy... don't be deceived). Our other favorites are:  Quinoa-stuffed avocado  (add chicken) The \"Great\"  wrap with sweet potato fries (ask for these extra crispy.. sometimes they're just not great) Chicken Soup (small is enough.. the large is enough to feed at least 3)  They have an online take-out menu that you can order with. Use it. Do it to it, folks!",

We got 2 quarter chickens that came with 2 sides we chose fried plantains and cilantro rice (w/ green peas and spot pieces of carrots) it was all very tasty! My one complaint is the rice portions could be a lot bigger. I mean seriously it's the cheapest thing on the menu and it's barely enough rice. Definitely no leftovers! But still I will be back to try more. The flavors alone are worth it. Also tried a chicken wrap don't remember the name. But my fiance loved it.

Going there thinking there is no way this place will be as good as Pio Pio back in NYC but was I wrong. I am not saying its better than Pio Pio but it is definitely right up there. Viva does have Pio Pio beat on the free rang all natural chicken that they use. And their sauce, oh the sauce super delicious, all 3 heat levels but I must say the red sauce is definitely the best out of the 3. The stuffed avocado was also amazing and I saved the best to last, their tres leches cake....omg....omg...it is to die for. By far the best tres leches I've ever had. Took 5 slices home with me.

I got the Viva Chicken Salad and expected the chicken on the salad to be seasoned, but it was not. Very bland. The Sweet Plantains were the only good thing about this place, but you can get those at any Peruvian joint. Also, we sat out on the patio in the afternoon and they had really annoying club music blasting through the outdoor speakers. When I go out to lunch, I want a relaxing, quiet atmosphere. Maybe that's just me. Overpriced IMHO, and I think what we were paying for was the \"trendy\" atmosphere, NOT good food.",

It's not pricey, but not super cheap either; bottom line is that it's worth the money. I usually order a quarter chicken and two sides, plenty of food (but it is so good you may want more). Also, the patio is pretty cool with the plants growing around it and all. The staff is nice and friendly. It's not far from Uptown and is good for either lunch or dinner.",

Lomo is one of the best Peruvian dishes. However, the Lomo served here is not good. The meat was tough, very tough. The tomatoes and onions were barely cooked. The sauce was ok. I was very disappointed to find that one of the few Peruvian restaurants in Charlotte was this bad and this highly rated on Yelp.  As a fellow Yelper mentioned in their review, this place is, at best, a Pollo Tropical (South Florida).",

At one point, the two people behind the counter literally started talking about me as I stood there looking at the menu board. There was no one behind me at that point. But the guy taking the orders put his hand on his mouth and whispered to the other one \"He can't decide what he wants.\"  \"That is True,\" I said. The guy looks at me, and walks away.   Now, no one else was ordering at the time. I was alone in the line. So, why does this place need two people to NOT be helpful and offer to answer questions I might have about the menu or offer suggestions?   One unhelpful employee would seem sufficient and would be far more efficient.  At that point, I finally noticed that they have little paper menus also. So, I took one of those and walked away.  And while I'm looking over the little paper menu, I processed what had just happened. And I decided I didn't need to waste time or money in a place that didn't want my business.   Now that I'm writing this, I feel like an idiot for wasting that extra minute or so looking over the paper menu.",

The staff are so helpful and friendly. They walked me through the menu.  This is a great choice for a casual sit down meal or take-out for your family!  They also have some great beer to pick from!",

Rotisserie chicken not much different than the grocery store? Also I was meh about the sauces. I know - I'm a crazy person. I just feel that the hype led me to disappointment. The herbal limeade was way to herbal for me also.   Maybe I will go back and try something different on the menu and be blown away. I should've tried the stuffed avocado. I am hoping I can go back and change my opinion! It just wasn't anything to write home about.  UPDATE: I love Viva now. Such a great place for a quick, healthy-ish meal.",

    "text": "This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Charlotte. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and everything is reasonably priced to boot!  If it's your first time here, the pollo a la brasas are highly recommended as this is a \"Peruvian chicken place\" after all. The rotisserie chickens are incredibly juicy and come in a variety of different portion sizes ranging from 1/4 chicken with 2 sides to a whole chicken with 3 sides (\"family style\"). Yet somehow, no matter what portion size you order it always ends up being too much to finish in one sitting!  In addition to the rotisserie options, Viva Chicken draws heavily from \"chifa\" (Peruvian-Chinese) cuisine as well in the Classic Saltado and Arroz Chaufa options. Both are delicious, but I wanted to highlight the Arroz Chaufa in particular as it puts the fried rice in all the Asian restaurants in Charlotte to shame (and I've been to a lot of the Asian restaurants here). When I'm craving fried rice, I come to Viva Chicken for the Arroz Chaufa.  Last but not least, no visit to Viva Chicken is complete without the churros!! Though some conscious eaters may find these a bit too indulgent, these caramel-filled, cinnamon coated treats are definitely worth the guilt!",

    "text": "I've been here so many times and just realized I haven't reviewed it yet! I LOVE viva chicken. I'm so glad one of my co-workers told me about this place otherwise who knows when I would have come across it!   I'm a creature of habit so I haven't tried too many different menu items but I plan to soon! I usually get the whole chicken with 3 sides for dinner so that we have leftovers for lunch the next day. The chicken is so good, it's so tasty and far from dry. The spice blend is perfect. And don't even get me started on the yellow sauce...omg I could put that on everything and I may be guilty of getting a few extra containers to bring home every time I get take out!   We always get string beans as one side and then alternate the other two. We've had sweet potato fries, cilantro infused rice, side salad, and fried plantains all which are deeeelicious. My personal favorite are the plantains and fries, you can never go wrong with either! I need to try some new ones next time though! I've heard the quinoa stuffed avocados are amazing and I definitely will be trying those next time.   The few times we've sat in the restaurant and ate were rear. Super friendly staff and really accommodating. The guy walking around was refilling our waters and making sure everything was ok which I didn't expect since it's not really a \"sit down\" restaurant where you are served. I'm impressed every time I eat there and always look forward to going back!",

You can order online so your meal is ready when you get there which is fantastic because it tends to get crowded with long lines at the counter.   Whatever you do, don't forget to grab some sauces! The yellow (mild) and green (medium) are my favorites. If you're one of those picky chicken people, you can request all white meat in anything on the menu.",

    "text": "Viva el pollo, my friends!  Viva is located in the charming little section of Elizabeth nearby Earl's Grocery. There are two parking lots - one right across the street and one that is a little further down the street. I met my best friend right after work (a little after 5:00) on a Thursday and had no trouble finding a park.   When you walk in, you will be welcomed with the mighty aroma of Peruvian spices wafting off of the bounty of rotisserie chickens. It's walk-up/order-at-the-counter style. There are paper menus around the restaurant so you can grab one to look over while you wait (if there's a line) or a large menu right above the registers.  Since I had been looking forward to my Viva visit, I had already spent a good amount of time reading their menu online so I came in prepared and ready to order the quinoa stuffed avocados with pulled chicken and a sangria to drink.  Once you order, you're given a number and sent off to choose your own table. Since it was a nice evening, we grabbed a table on their patio which is enclosed with an array of potted and hanging plants. No sooner than a couple of minutes of us sitting down, our food was brought out to us.  I could tell from my first DELICIOUS bite of the avocado, that this dish was going to be quite filling. The avocados are topped with tomatoes and their house made sauces. It is literally a complete meal, even though it may not look like it. The sangria is amazing and something that I could happily drink a pitcher of without blinking an eye. It's served with orange and apple slices that are extra delicious after you've slurped down the sangria and they've soaked up the juice :)  Even though there's no typical waiter/waitress service, there are employees who come out to check in on your satisfaction and bring out anything else you may need to accompany your meal. Every single employee I encountered was extremely courteous and helpful.  Viva is Peruvian-inspired not completely authentic Peruvian food so don't come here with the latter in mind. What's most important is that the food and drinks are made with fresh ingredients, served efficiently and delicioiusly.  I happily volunteer as tribute to try every single Viva menu item between now and the end of the Summer.",

It is properly seasoned and so tender and delectable. It pairs well on a sandwich with ciabatta bread.  The chicken whether you get white or dark is going to be flavorful and moist. The skin is the best part but the skin is ALWAYS the best part.  This place is crowded. I mean crowded. I have never physically sat here to eat because I can't be bothered with the crowd and waiting for a table. The first time I placed our order to go without calling it in and I learned quickly that calling it in is hands down the best way to go. If you are going to take your order to go, calling it in is the ONLY way to go.  Skip the yellow sauce. Go directly to red and green. And I know it says their red sauce is really spicy but it is NOT hot but very flavorful. I almost always purchase a bottle of the green and red sauce every time and I use it on everything.

    "text": "Viva chicken lives up to the hype. Ordered a whole chicken +green beans + rice + fruit. Chicken was delicious, infused with herbs and spices. This came with three sauces. The yellow sauce, sprinkled with angel tears, is easily the best and reminds me of an aioli. Green sauce is spicy. Reddish sauce is tame. Green beans were fresh and had diced tomatoes. Rice was on the dry side, but with yellow sauce came to life. Fruit was made mostly with pineapple, apple, and orange. Fruit portion was enough for 2, whereas rice and beans could serve four. I also had their papaya juice. It was so, so. Sweet, but I'll get water next time.  The format is that you walk in, order food and pay at the counter, where you will be given a number and can seat yourself. Food is brought out to you. There were several staff members on hand and a nice guy whose name started with a V and had a beautiful Russian accent was very helpful explaining the menu items in depth and making recommendations. He also came over and asked if we needed a high chair for my baby niece. Thank goodness for helpful people.  Combos $9. Drinks $2.5 Whole chicken + 3 sides $21.  Only recommendation for improvement are bigger plates. I'm also not clear whether tipping is appropriate here. It's more self serve, but the staff was very helpful and kind of assisted when they saw fit. Overall, great value if you have a family.",

    "text": "Such a cozy find thanks to Yelp. My friends seemed to have enjoyed their meals. And this place seemed to be popular with the locals as well. I choose well!   I think The Great (aka chicken sandwich) was pretty tasty. The chicken was fresh, but it could use more seasoning as it was more on the bland side. You have the option to make it a sandwich or wrap. Mine was the sandwich form with ciabatta as the bread. It overall had a great mixture of both meat and veggies. That thing was huge too.  There's also a side option with this entree. I choose the yuka fries. It only came with 4 jumbo pieces. It was okay and nothing too wowing imo. The French fries my friends had was delish. It was coated with the right amount of salt, and the crispiness was just right as well. Okay. I'm partial to these fries. Lol. The sweet potato fries were okay imo.   There was a sauce that accompanied these entrees that was delish and had a slight spicy kick, very slight. I wasn't sure if it was for the entrees or side items, but either was a sound choice. The maracuyu (passion fruit) drink was delish. It had just the right amount of sweetness. If each member of the group is going for this drink then purchase the half gallon option. I think it's cheaper this way as my friend choose this option after two of us had ordered individuals drinks already. Lol.  Parking was unique. There is a parking lot, but it's only accessible from one end of the restaurant. The other side has parallel parking. It's free on the weekends though as my friend visited here last Sunday.",

    "text": "The rotisserie chicken at this hipster restaurant in Charlotte is bomb, you can also try a couple of things since its pretty cheap. Not only is it moist, it's also savory and the prices can't get any better. We tried one of the special drinks (can't remember what it was called but it was purple) and it was really tasty. The quinoa is delicious too, small side but if you can't decide get this healthy option. Don't leave without trying the Wow Lomito sandwich, the sirloin is so flavorful.   The only negative is the area it's in. It seems like it's a white neighborhood, so when me and my boyfriend stepped out of the car we got weird and passive aggressive looks from three white men and dozens of people in another restaurant on the strip.",

The restaurant is almost always packed in the evenings and on weekends. You can usually find a table, but you'll be dodging people and waiting in line for sauces. Parking is somewhat limited, but you can always find something within a few blocks near Elizabeth.   I usually get a quarter roasted chicken with green beans and sweet potato fries as my side. All of the sides are pretty great, but these are definitely my favorite. The chicken is tender and very well seasoned. The skin is absolutely delicious. The stuffed avocado on quinoa is also a very good and fairly healthy dish to go for.   The sauces are awesome. The yellow sauce is my favorite. I sometimes take extra home to sip other foods into as well.   They have a small selection of local canned beers along with fountain sodas and lemonades.   I always enjoy eating here and plan to keep it in my regular rotation!",

The chicken is out of this world, and if you're having troubling finding the right sides, the employees are your best friends. The chicken is an obvious staple, but make sure you get the fried polenta to get a sweet succulent taste of Peruvian goodness.

The chicken was broken down into 4 pieces (2 white meat and 2 dark meat pieces), which was helpful. The meat fell right off the bone. You get 4 sauces with the chicken as well. There were only 3 in our bag, so unfortunately, I didn't get to sample all of them but their mild sauce was my favorite. Ordered the plantains, yuca and Peruvian corn salad for our sides. Their plantains and yuca (like a more fibrous French fry) were good, but nothing quite as memorable as their chicken. Their Peruvian corn salad had less corn and more fava beans and tomato. I wanted to give it a try, but probably wouldn't order it again. Their fried rice was ok - a little on the salty side. Loved their passion fruit juice. I would go back just for that.",

Food: Viva is a quick service, rotisserie chicken restaurant serving up Peruvian inspired dishes. I always get the 1/4 chicken (all white meat) with sides of cilantro rice and plantains. Their plantains are phenomenal -- great flavor and a little bit of crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. They have a selection of dipping sauces -- I prefer the green sauce, which is medium spicy. They made an herbal lemonade that I highly recommend if you like basil.   Service: Service here is usually great! They are quick to get people through the line at the register, which can sometimes seem daunting. Once you order, you can take a seat and someone will bring your food out. They also bus tables if it looks like you're wrapping up.  Parking: Elizabeth has its own free parking lot and it's across the street from Viva Chicken.   I highly recommend Viva!",

The entrees sound really interesting, and if I actually lived in Charlotte, I'd probably work my way through the menu.  I can see how the restaurant would get SWAMPED during lunch considering its location across the street from the hospital. Parking in the lot is a little confusing, but I wasn't towed...YOLO?

The flavor was fantastic and everyone ate quickly. There were three different kinds of sauces you could grab from dispensers near the water/soda fountain and I tried all three although the chicken really didn't need it.   I had a quarter of chicken and two sides. My sides were the chicken soup and sweet potato fries. Too many onions in the soup for me to handle so I traded and finished someone else's green beans, which were delicious. Everyone had some of the sweet potato fries and quite enjoyed them. As for my drink, I chose to branch out and try something new: the chicha morada. Peruvian Purple Corn, Cinnamon, Clove, Pineapple, Apple, Limes. Tasted like Christmas. That unique flavor alone was fascinating.   This is a stand in line to pay at the counter and collect your number kind of spot, but someone checked on us often to see if we needed anything, took away plates, and filled up drinks. Impressive service. I'm a fan.",

However, my most recent experience was very underwhelming.   As soon as I walked in, it was evident that the cleanliness of the restaurant had decreased sufficiently. The bathroom was DISGUSTING! it smelled terribly, there was no toilet paper, and, most concerning, I was sticking to the floor. I can't describe it any better than those working there seemed to have a complacent attitude about everything from the cleanliness to the service. I am used to friendly faces at the register and, while there may have been something going on that I was not aware of, the cashiers were stand-offish and short. It felt like I was an annoyance to them.   When the food came out, my salad had a sprinkle of chicken and the sweet potato fries were mushy and luke-warm. The food was okay but nothing special or to rave home about. Also, one of the employees was clearly sick with a cold and sneezing as he cleared plates (while one of my friends was still eating). It was gross (as harsh as that may sound). He should have stayed home.   I can say confidently say that is has been much better in the past. It is like they took no pride in their restaurant, and regardless of it being a more casual establishment it is still a business.",

    "text": "I got introduced to Peruvian chicken over 20 years ago in DC area.  Ever since, I consider Peruvian chicken as best of the best hands down.    I had business trip to Charlotte so first thing I did was look up Yelp to see what's good in this town.  When I saw Viva with top rating, I had to try this.    Good thing I did.  I ordered 1/2 chicken w two sides.   Gotta have my yuca and tried their rice. (They don't offer rice n beans like most of other Peruvian places).  I got all three sauces from the sauce bar, and waited for my food to come out  It was as advertised, and actually exceeded my expectation.  Chicken was crispy and juicy, sauces were all excellent.  Definitely deserves 5 stars.   Hope they open one in Jacksonville.  Now I got something to look forward to when I come up to Charlotte.",

That was definitely a good sign.   I ordered \"The Great\" sandwich, which had pulled chicken, onion, lettuce, and tomato, and a side of cilantro rice. The sandwich lived up to its name. The chicken was moist and the veggies were fresh. I didn't branch out to try the sauces they had, but I'll be sure to try them next time. The rice wasn't my favorite, but I tend to be fairly picky about everything I eat.   We were able to grab a table outside in the covered patio area, but after we took our seat, there was no other table left for the people who came in after us. Lucky for us, unlucky for them.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  This was our first visit to Viva Chicken, but most definitely not our last.  When I compare this to Pio Pio, though (which we've eaten at half a dozen times), I think Pio Pio's quality slightly edges out Viva.  But, they are a sit-down restaurant and also more expensive, so they are in sort of a different category, although the food is similar.    We started with the quinoa stuffed avocado, which everyone has raved about on Yelp.  I know I'm in the minority by saying I wasn't a fan of this dish...it tasted too mayonnaise-y to me.  I would have preferred a simpler quinoa with just a little of the sauce on top, rather than sauce mixed throughout the quinoa.  For my entree, I had the quarter chicken (white), with cilantro-infused rice and sweet plantains.  The chicken was tasty, but a smaller portion than I usually get at Pio, and slightly less tender.  The green sauce was my favorite of the two that came with the dish, but it wasn't as flavorful (or hot) as the sauces served at Pio.  I loved the cilantro in the rice, but could have done without the peas and carrots.  The plantains were very good, and some of the best I've had.  My biggest complaint was that it was a little hard to eat the chicken with cheap, plastic utensils.  Viva would be better served to at least upgrade the utensils so it's easier to pull the chicken off the bone.    My hubby had \"The Great\" sandwich, with avocado, cheese, and bacon.  Her really loved this sandwich, as well as the beans he ordered as a side.  I usually don't get sodas at restaurants, but they had an interesting herb-infused lemonade that I had to try.  I'm not sure how much it cost me, but it was really tasty, and I'd order it again.  Viva's patio is really nice.  It's covered and surrounded by planters, so it's well-shaded.  But there are only about ten tables out there, so you have to get there early to snag a seat!  The mood music they play is also a welcome change from the pop crap that most other businesses play!  Another thing I really liked about Viva was the service.  Even though you order at the counter, the staff are very friendly and check on you while eating to make sure you are happy with everything.  We didn't see a tip jar out front, and so we left a small tip on the table as a thank you.  I've seen a few complaints about parking, but I've always been able to park in the lot across from Viva (it's free) without any issue.  There's also a large gravel lot next to the tequila bar on the other end of the restaurant strip which is designated for these businesses.  It's not far to walk from Viva from that location, so it's a good backup lot if the main lot is full.  Overall, we paid $35 for our meal, including a beer for my hubby.  That's a little more than I would have expected to pay at a casual place.  Regardless, we plan to return because the food is good and the outdoor seating is so nice.",

    "text": "So, I'm conflicted.   During my first two visits I ordered \"The Great\" ($7.50) (Pulled rotisserie chicken, onions, tomato, lettuce, smoked rocoto mayo, grilled artisan ciabatta bread) which was delicious both times. Most recently, I ordered the Quinoa Stuffed Avocado ($7.95) (organic quinoa, onions, cucumber, tomato, cilantro, olive oil, lime plus pulled chicken $1.95). The sandwich was delicious both times but the stuffed avocados, though pretty looking, just didn't impress me.  The chicken was dry and flavorless and the avocado was not ripe enough making it difficult to eat. Another at the table complained of dry flavorless chicken too and unfortunately for him he had the 1/2 platter. A big bummer because, until this trip Viva Chicken, was easily my favorite lunch spot in Charlotte.  I will still absolutely return and know to stick with the sandwich. PS: the sauces (don't know what they're called) are DELICIOUS. Also, try the Yucca!  I do love the interior and the patio with pretty gutter planters. Order at the counter, grab a number and they'll bring it out to you. VERY busy if you come right a noon, may even be busy if you come at 11:45, but the lines and food does seem to come quick.  So one mediocre trip out of 3? Viva, you're still a four in my book!",

Stopped by on a Tuesday to grab some lunch with my boyfriend. He had the 1/4 chicken with sweet potato fries and a salad. I had the linguine entree. His fries were tasty and crunchy. We both loved it. OMG I love the sauce that they used for the salad. That was the best part. The chicken was perfectly cooked and still had juice. It was delicious. My entree was good, but I wished it had a little more flavor. Towards the bottom, it became salty. I really appreciate all the chicken they used for the entree, though. We also ordered their passion fruit drink. LOVED it! We had to get a 2nd one. The inside was nice and comfy. The designs reminded me of korean restaurants in korea. I had no problem what so ever here.  We came back the same week on thursday and it was super busy. Maybe Thursday is one of their busy days? The cashier guy recognized us, which is good cause that show he knows his customers. My boyfriend got the same thing he ordered on Tuesday but this time, the chicken was a little dry and the fries were soggy. Of course the salad and the sauce were still good. I LOVE the sauce. I just tried the stuffed avocado that a lot of people were suggesting. It was really good. I'm guessing they used the same sauce as the salad dressing for the topping because it tasted and looked like it. Don't get me wrong, I love avocado and chicken, so obviously I liked the appetizer, but it's nothing to raved about. I was really good food though.   Really enjoyed the experiences here and will definitely come back again.",

A gem that everyone seems to be raving about!  This place is my guilty pleasure, as I can always find something on the menu that I enjoy. It's main focus is a Peruvian style rotisserie chicken. Who doesn't love chicken!? Some of my favorites are \"The Great wrap\" and the \"Quinoa Stuffed Avocado\". In my opinion, these are probably the most popular meals here. As for sides, I always get the Yuca fries. They're so addicting and pair well with all three of the homemade sauces. Also, Their prices are very reasonable. I never spend over $10 dollars, and leave full every time.   The food is prepared very fast, and the customer service is great. I alway get a good vibe from the workers, as they seem to enjoy serving the customers. I really like how they have it set up to place orders. It is very similar to Zoe's Kitchen where you place your order and they take the food to you when it's ready. Although you don't have a \"server\", there is always staff going around to check to see if you need anything. I recommend Viva Chicken to anyone looking for outstanding service and delightful food!",

For starters, the quinoa stuffed avocado with chicken... wow! It is the best form of avocado I've had, and that includes the very delicious guacamole! It is also rather filling so I just decided to have it as an entree instead of an appetizer or a side. Also, the chicken! It's mind blowing. I have no idea what they marinate it with, but whatever they use has to be made with something unicorns and rainbows! I'm a fan of dark meat chicken and my boyfriend loves white meat so the half chicken is perfect for us. Oh and the huacatay sauce! That's my favorite and my boyfriend loves the milder Aji Amarillo Sauce. I want that stuff on everything I eat!! This time we also happened to order the Arroz Chaufa which is a kind of fried rice which I'm definitely getting again next time! The sides are very delicious too... My favorite are the yucca fries and plantain fries and my boyfriend loves the cilantro rice. Oh and the Inca soda! It's kind of a cream soda.

The chicken is super delicious and tender and the dipping sauce just add a bonus to it! We also love their fries. My husband works at the hospital so we also get an extra 10% discount  on our meal. We have started making this a dinner meal every other week or so. Definitely worth a try! :)",

My wife thoroughly enjoyed it.   I had a quarter rotisserie chicken with canary beans and plantains. The chicken is moist, tender and very flavorful. (Get the half chicken if you're hungry, the leg/ thigh piece I had was a little on the small side.) The sauces that come with the chicken are very good also, the more spicy yellow sauce is worth the price to take home a bottle. The canary beans were cooked perfectly, tender, creamy and well seasoned. The fried plantains were great also, not greasy at all.  Fresh brewed iced tea was not too sweet.   The staff was friendly and helpful. Can't wait too go back and try some other menu items. If we lived closer, this would be weekly visit.",

Every visit I have shared the chicken and the classic saltados (stir fried beef, tomatoes, onions, and french fries in a vinegary soy sauce.)  My first experience was a solid 4 stars.   The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the saltados were on point.   I should mention that saltados would likely be my desert island food choice.  I love almost every version.   On visit two, the chicken was ok.  Not as flavorful as I remembered, but still good.  The saltados however were kind of dismal.  Dry, tough beef and completely disintegrated fries.  It was almost like it had been sitting for a while, even thought I know that wasn't the case.   I left just a little unsatisfied.    Round three was just kind of sad.  I was determined to relive my fist experience, so I returned again.   The chicken skin was cold and flabby.  The saltados had a weird, charred quality to them with no decernable sauce.   Even the dulce de leche cookies for dessert were bad; sandy and stale this time.    The service however is impeccable.  They really try to provide a great experience.  If only the kitchen had the same consistency.",

No need to be intimidated at first glance when you see Peruvian. Viva Chicken does a great job making the menu feel very familiar. Any trepidation will quickly vanish once the smell reaches you in the parking lot.   I have made my way through most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The taco bowl is one of my favorites as I am a sucker for pickled onions; and Viva knows how to pile on the onions. The serving is large enough that I always make two meals out of it.   Try everything once and discover your favorite. Each item has its own favors, making it a great place to frequent.   If all this wasn't great enough, they also serve some tasty sweets and juices. Also, Elizabeth creamery is just a block away - get some ice cream after your meal and enjoy a walk through Elizabeth.",

    "text": "I'm a long-time lover of Peruvian cuisine and anything that even hints at having plantains, yucca, rotisserie/grilled chicken, and South American pastries....or anything with \"Dulce de Leche\" in the name. I'm a sucker, I know, but Viva exudes all of the aspects of a staple in town for a quick-service resto. It was pretty astonishing to learn that this joint is totally Charlotte-based.   There are so many things that gave this experience 5 out of 5 for me.   Service: Holy cow. The woman at the register was super helpful. She gave me some background on everything I had questions about. I'm a firm believer that the more questions you ask, the more likely you are to find out what you'll end up loving. The gentleman working the line was equally helpful. He gave us some background on the housemade drinks, Inca Kola (tastes exactly like bubblegum, by the way), other processes, Peruvian cuisine, and the back story. They give you a number if you dine in and bring your order to your table. They were even so kind to spell everything out, give some info on flavors of the different Aji (sauces), and came back to ask how everything was. Top notch service indeed.   The flavors. Oh, my. First, The Great. This is the staple chicken sandwich under this roof and it's a force of culinary nature. It all starts in the \"Green Oven\" they have straight from Peru. It's a rotisserie/grill hybrid that gives the chicken immaculate flavor. Imagine pulled, tender, juicy chicken with charred flavor and absolutely no compromise in texture/chew. I was astounded. It is served on ciabatta with red onion, tomatoes, and a spread of some sauce. Add avocado and provalone. You won't be sorry you did.   The yucca and plantains were top notch. Dunked heavily in the Aji Amarillo and the green Aji sauce. I'd eat these with every meal.   We also ordered the avocado stuffed with quinoa. Sounds odd, looks odd, tastes AMAZING. Balsamic is a nice touch. Don't be scared. Just try it if it's your style.   The alfajores, shortbread cookies with dulce de leche, are incredible. Coated in powdered sugar and only beckon a tall glass of milk. Buy them in two or four packs. They make these suckers in-house, too.   Inca Kola. Loved it, so interesting, can't wait to have it again. Ever wondered what a liquid version of Bazooka bubblegum would taste like? Here ya go.   Prices vary on dishes. Some of the entrees are a little more pricey (as expected) and the sandwiches, sides, and apps are a bit more modest in price. Definitely a little more pricey than some, but you can get out the door with a meal under your belt for between $10-$15 no problem.  The whole experience was awesome. I loved all of the background on the concept, preparation, kitchen, etc. Such a nice dinner and I'm already planning a menu for my next visit. That chicken is just too damn good to not be in my life. Viva...Viva Chicken indeed!",

    "text": "Viva Chicken has become our favorite new place to go for a quick, delicious meal.  Our first visit, we went to the one in Ballantyne; on our second, the one in Elizabeth.  I'm usually not one to like a meal with chicken on the bone, but in this case, I'll make an exception.  Whatever Viva Chicken does to their rotisserie chicken works.   It tastes so delicious on its own (I get the all-white version), but when you add their unique yellow Aji Amarillo and green Huacatay dipping sauces to it, it's out of this world!  I also can't get enough of their yucca fries as a side (I wish they served more!).   As my second side, I've tried the chicken and rice soup and the canary beans.  The soup was good, but I think the canary beans were better.  I'm not a big fan of green beans, but I've heard that theirs are pretty amazing, so I'll have to try those next time as my 2nd side (I'll never not get yucca fries as my 1st side).    Also, all three of their juice drinks are amazing.  Skip the soda and water, and order one of these -- you won't be sorry.  Tip: Ask for a tiny sample of each and see which one you like best!  So far, mine has been the lemonade infused with basil, rosemary, and mint, but the other two are delicious as well.    The Elizabeth location has indoor dining and a BIG outdoor seating area, too.",

They give discounts to employees at local businesses like the hospital and us at Uptown Church.  I've not had anything don't love there. Of course. The Peruvian chicken (rotisserie) is the main thing. Just falls off the bone. I usually get a half or a quarter chicken with a couple of sides. But I will sometimes get the arroz chaufa, so good. They have great Peruvian sides! One of the best is the stuffed avocado. I will sometimes get a couple of these as a meal and I never regret it. Stuffed with chicken and quinoa, over lettuce. Other great sides are the yucca fries, the white beans, and the green beans.  Also, the sandwiches are great! You can't go wrong with The Great.  I highly recommend Viva Chicken.",

While I can still see the old Starbucks layout in my mind, Viva did a great job remoldeling this space & making it their own. The interior of the restaurant is warm & inviting, although it is very small.   The lady at the register was very friendly & clearly has a good memory. She knew by heart was Dion would order. I on the other hand went against chicken & chose the \"Wow Limito\" (sirloin steak sandwich) & fries.  We decided to sit outside on the patio - which is lovely, by the way. You're surrounded by plants all along the \"walls.\"   We didn't wait but about five minutes & all our entrees arrived.  My sandwich was perfect, the toppings fresh & the steak cooked thoroughly. The fries we hot, crispy & plentiful. The mustardy-yellow sauce that accompanied was delicious! It had a nice \"kick\" to it.  The prices are hit & miss. Some entrees/dishes seem to be a bit overpriced, while others are reasonable.  If you're a fan of Pio Pio &/or Peruvian food, do yourself a favor & head on over to Viva Chicken.",

    "text": "Mmmmmm...   The fella and I visited Viva Chicken after I heard about 37 different people proclaim it as their favorite place.  Even with high expectations, it didn't disappoint.    As others have said, it's in the old Anderson's building right in front of Presbyterian Hospital, and parking was easy on a Wednesday night right across the street.  I was worried about seating, but there were easily enough tables to seat 30 or so people inside and even more outside on the cutest covered porch I've ever seen.  If it hadn't been 93 degrees outside, I would've tried it.  The minute we walked in the door, a guy behind the counter enthusiastically said hello and welcome and gave us the rundown on the menu.  The lady behind the register was super nice and gave us some good suggestions on what to order, so I got the rotisserie quarter-chicken (all white meat) with plantains and yucca and sangria, and the fella got The Great sandwich with fries and white wine,  which is stored in a tiny bottle in the mini fridge on the counter along with some desserts and other beverages.  (Trust me that this is super cute and not bizarre.)    We took our number and our wine, found a table by the window and waited maybe 3 minutes til the food came out.  The chicken was hot and perfectly seasoned, and I had to force myself not to eat the plantains first; they were worth the wait.  The yucca was really good, but I'd never had it before, so I can't compare it to anything.  The two sauces it came with (on the side) were a little spicy for me, but the food didn't even need sauces.  Fella said the sandwich was really good and could've used more meat and less \"stuff\" (a.k.a. - lettuce, tomato and onions), but he's a serious carnivore, so that statement could be said about meat pie.  The prices are reasonable, the service is better than some fine dining establishments I've been to, and the food is to die for.  I can't wait to work my way through the rest of the menu!",

Go with the Chicken, the Viva Salad is not impressive - so go big with a chicken! For sides I recommend the Yuka or the rice and chicken soup. The side salads are great too, I love the dressing.

The green beans were crisp and had a vague Asian style/ginger flavor. The yuca fries were so tender! I'm used to yuca bring flash fried and have a tough, veiny exterior - a pleasant difference!  Everyone on staff was very working and would walk around cleaning, checking in with guests, and taking half a second to joke with coworkers. It's obvious they enjoy what they do. Bathrooms are clean, but single stalls. The music is an upbeat techno (do people even use that word anymore?) and low lights - I felt like there was a nightclub nearby.",

Every layer is always perfect from the rice & beans to the onion/tomato salsa to the shredded rotisserie chicken.  Don't forget to order extra Aji Amarillo sauce because you'll need it.  This is quite possibly the best \"sauce\" I've ever encountered.  I swipe my finger to pick up the remains every time, so that says it all.  As far as the sides are concerned, nothing is short of excellent.  I've had fried yuca many times before including South Florida (and one anonymous place down Central Ave here in CLT), but Viva consistently delivers the best I've ever had.  Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside.  Dip that bad boy in the Aji sauce and you're in business.  The fried plantains are also clutch.  I haven't ventured toward much else, but why would I?  I'm here for the Peruvian food.  Viva has a great product and they're booming.   They've got healthy, delicious food that you order at the counter.  Don't forget to wash it down with one of the eclectic Hispanic beverages, Cheerwine on tap, or local beers!",

Now, the Yuca fries were good as long as you don't dip them in the sauce it comes with because it taste like cheap nacho cheese.  Now, there was a secret yellow sauce they served both my wife and me that made everything alot better.  I ended up putting it on everything.  my wife's sandwich had chicken with it that was a little dry and very bland.  If we go back we will try the chicken alone because it seems like thar was what most people were eating.  All in all, the prices were great and the food was on the healthier side.",

    "text": "A great addition to the Charlotte food scene. The menu is original and the authentic Peruvian style cuisine is unlike anything you can try at most places, and at a good price ($10-12 per person). This place has great food, and big portions, but don't got there expecting much besides their specialties: rotisserie chicken, rice, sandwiches, and great ,great sauces. The place is well decorated and has a nice outdoor patio, and the service is polite and friendly.",

You might need to order an extra side of frys through. The regular fries are amazing, sweet potatoes frys are so-so.  The avocado appetizer is a favorite , and they have two in house sauces that I put on everything!",

    "text": "Tried this place for lunch today and it was my first experience with Peruvian food (though I've been to neighboring Ecuador, and they have many similar dishes).  I got the Sopa de Pollo (chicken soup) and Hey, Causita (best described as a little tower of alternating layers of chicken salad and mashed potatoes). The soup was OK, not overly flavorful, but not bad... Just kinda there.   The Hey, Causita was very good.  Chicken salad and mashed potatoes may sound like an odd mix, but it was delicious. The staff was very friendly and service was fairly quick.  I'd go back for the Hey, Causita.  Check out the little Elizabeth Creamery ice cream shop next door as well!",
