The food here is outstanding - I got a musashi bento box (probably should have went lighter on the soup and salad I had beforehand) with some sort of citrusy wine. Everything was excellent - it looks to be a family-owned business as well, and it shows with the excellent and courteous service (of course, the place is usually busy, so don't come here expecting fast food, but our order arrived within reasonable time). Do check this place out!",

The sushi set I ordered was a typical Americanized sushi affair. Not authentic at all.  I also don't know where they find their cooks, but I seriously doubt the Japanese guy behind the sushi counter was properly trained in the sushi making (at least not in Japan). Just because the guy is a Japanese, doesn't make him any kind of sushi master. It's a profession, not a nationality. He also was very slow in making his sushis. I had to wait at the counter for my sushi set for nearly 30 mins while the guy was chatting a bunch of lame stuff with other customers at the counter. Not only he doesn't seem like a proper sushi cook, his work-attitude was not professional at all. They need to hire somebody else before he pisses off too many customers.",

I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well. My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30pm and were the only souls in the place. Let me also say how hard it was to find this place. Granted, it was raining and dark, but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this strip/suite mall. I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold, rainy night and it sounded very comfortable, like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent. Overall this place was just ok. I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggies.",

    "text": "It took a few visits before I felt comfortable with the staff at Musashi - I don't think they're intentionally unfriendly, they just don't go that extra mile. Once you get to know them though, from waitstaff, to sushi chef to kitchen guy - they're super nice. But let's get to the real reason why you should go to this place - the food. I think it's the most legit Japanese in Charlotte (primarily because the place is dominated by Japanese patrons).  Agedashi Tofu - broth is to die for and the tofu so  delicately breaded Sea Snails - one again, boiled/steamed in sake and the shells put out a delicious broth on their own. Texture similar to conch. Dumplings - I usually don't love dumplings in Japanese restaurants, but these are delightful little morsels that are worth an order.  Sushi/Sashimi is outstanding - they have all of the standard stuff and prices are pretty reasonable. Soba/Udon - delicious noodles and clear or dark broth...haven't tried the cold Soba, but that's my next step.   There is a traditional Japanese menu on the back of the regular menu, and I told the waitress that  next time she can help me order from that non-Gaijin menu!! She said she would be happy to do so!  To heck with the strip mall atmosphere - this is just a great little gem in South Charlotte for sushi lovers who don't want to dress up like they're going clubbing don't want disco balls and sake bombs (sorry Nikko and Enso).",

I had some kind of vegetarian nabe (like a one pot dish) and beef tongue, my friend had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlets-- they gave more than one, which was a surprise), and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank (maybe about $30 a person with tip and everything).  The atmosphere is nothing special. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall, but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style (if that's your thing). Personally, I'd rather have good food than a beautiful restaurant, so I didn't mind at all.  All-in-all, I think I'll definitely go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food that's a bit tough to find in Charlotte.  The key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese, which is always a good sign!",

    "text": "Worst restaurant I have eaten at in a very long time.  I do not understand why this place has any stars at all.  They were out of basic sushi, like tuna etc. The servers were rude. Three of us were there for dinner on Wednesday, they brought out one persons meal, then after that person was done eating, they brought out the second persons meal, and then after that person was done eating, they brought out the last meal, (which was sushi, so should not have taken an hour).  So each person had to eat their dinner while the other two watched.  The sushi menu was stapled scraps of paper that looked like it was made by a kindergartner, and was very limited, missing even basic items, like salmon roll, tuna roll, eel roll, etc.  Salmon roe (Ikura) was dried out, so I didn't even eat it, and they only gave me a half portion.  (The Ikura can say a lot about a place.. it should be wet and firm, so they explode in your mouth when you apply pressure with your teeth.  If they are sticky, deflated, over-salted and mushy, they are no good, and the pace probably isn't either.)   My brother got the pork ramen soup and said it was the worst he has ever eaten.. the noodles were pasty, the broth had WAY too much salt, etc.  He said it was worse than the packaged stuff.  The place was also dirty, especially the bathrooms.  It was a horrible experience in almost every way a place can be horrible.  There is no chance we will EVER go back!  Stay away from this place, FAR AWAY!",

    "text": "With Musashi, as with other places I enjoy, its all about the food. I don't need a greeter with a plastered smile, or somebody doting on me every 15 seconds. If I have to wait 15 minutes for a table at Musashi, that's fine, cause I know the food more than makes up for it.  That said, I know this place is hit or miss. My sister and I absolutely loved the place, as did my Japanese roommates (always ALWAYS a good sign that your Japanese roommates love the same Japanese restaurant you do.) But, my brother and sister-in-law weren't too impressed. I think Musashi is good, solid Japanese food. Nothing too fancy. What they did they did well. Their agadeshi tofu is the standard against which all other fried tofus are measured. Light, crisp, with a flavorful, but not too salty, sauce. The katsudon is how it should be, hot, eggy, with just the right amount of gravy to flavor the rice. There is also a special Japanese menu, with \"snacks\" which make great accompaniments to beer and sake, or if you're in the mood for \"tapas\". I especially like the grilled cod and the beef tongue. There's also an excellent sukiyaki. The lunchtime bento boxes were also very good.  You gotta understand. When you're living in Charlotte, there's not much in the way of Japanese food. And when you've been to Japan three or four times, you start getting a taste for more than just the same tired sushi rolls. That's where Musashi comes in. They've got more than just the same standard sushi, udon, teriyaki and potato salad items that you find at the generic Japanese places dotting the US. And they don't try to get too fancy.   And try to remember, its all about the food. Not about the lines, not the lack of greeting when you enter, not the crazy eyed lady who doesn't call you \"honey.\" It's the food.",

    "text": "*I have given up on Japanese food in Charlotte*  Any restaurant that fails to acknowledge the customer for over 5 minutes is never going to be good in my book. Musashi makes it easy by serving average food to go with their incredibly crappy service.  We came in the door and waited by the register for over 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us. The place is pretty small so its not like they couldn't see us. The sushi chefs kept looking at us but never moved a muscle to signal the waitresses that we were waiting. After we sat down, we ordered beer which arrived soon but after that the service was back to crap.   We ordered tamago sushi which never arrived and we had to ask another waitress to get it because our original waitress simply stopped attending tables. The tamago was quite good.   I got the Udon which was basically chicken broth and noodles with a little green onions sprinkled on it. A monkey can be more creative than that and I certainly did not enjoy paying $9 for it. It had no taste, no spices, not even any soy sauce in it. It was literally broth and noodles. I showered it with their chilli flakes so I could trick myself into thinking it was eatable.  Oh and the service wasn't bad for all customers - these two Japanese guys came in and the wait staff fell over each other trying to please them. Every other table was being ignored but these two basically got personal slaves to take care of them. They never had to ask for anything, the waitress was hovering over their table every 3 minutes.   The service pissed me off and I would never go back even though their sushi is pretty good.",

That aside, the sashimi is serviceable and generally as fresh as Charlotte gets.  The specials will almost always be a fantastic deal. You will always have two options to choose from--and while people may hold subconscious grudges against the letter B, I can assure you that electing special B will not detract from your dining experience whatsoever.  My parents and sister love the mackerel here, if that's your thing; I have too many bad memories of those fermented fishies in rancid tomato paste to really care for it outside of raw sashimi slivers.  For those attempting to beat back the oppressive curtain that is the Charlotte summer, Musashi is one of the few places here that serves up a refreshing plate of chewy zaru soba.   I also remember the wines being spelled super weirdly.  Like Kabernet Sabigny-kind of weird.  That was sort of endearing.  Of course, it's plagued by the same service problems and dour server expressions that other Asian restaurants have, which still can be a bit of a shock in the land of sunshine and Southern hospitality.",

    "text": "First of all it must be said that this is a JAPANESE-style sushi house. If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture, this will not be the restaurant for you.   Japanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra, you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan. Americans and we southerner's especially, are not used to this type of service. This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese. If you eat lunch between 1-2PM you will have better service.  The food is also VERY Japanese. The emphasis is on the fresh fish and the rice. If you are not accustomed to Japanese food, then you may want a non-Japanese sushi bar like Sushi-101 (Mexican made) or Rusan's (Indonesian made) or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese. You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that's your idea of sushi.  I have eaten here every week for years. It is a small restaurant with basic rolls. They are very consistent and the food is always excellent. I have never gotten \"brown wasabe\" or fish that I didn't know what it was. The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll, a maki roll, soup, salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about $8.  I have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture. Now that I have explained it to you, maybe you will be able to enjoy Musashi's great food. If great service is most important to you, find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai House.",

Decent Japanese restaurants would put some grated daikon with grilled fish. Especially for these prices. Everything is so skimpy and jobs are sloppy.   Service? You don't have to take your dishes from/to kitchen. That's all about it.  This place used to be filled with Japanese business persons after work and Japanese families. Not many Japanese customers now. No wonder.  I keep praying for a decent authentic Japanese restaurant coming to Charlotte. For now, I just drive to the Triangle. It's worth 2.5 hour driving.",

At 12 pm, the sign flipped to open and a people started emerging from their car to walk in. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny. There were a few booths, two small 2-top tables, a few larger tables pushed together and a separate, traditional dining area for larger parties.  They had their lunch special A and lunch special B out to view on a table near the register. I ordered the lunch special A - rice with beef on top and a smaller bowl of pork ramen. The beau ordered the miso ramen. Overall, I enjoyed my food and he enjoyed his. It really wasn't anything to rave about though. Pretty standard. Definitely not the best ramen I've had, but hey... It was Charlotte good.   A few things I found annoying... The floors were slightly sticky feeling and the service was curt at best. I won't be going out of my way to return unless i have a huge hankering for ramen.",

Honestly I'm more scared of her than anything else. The other ladies are nicer, but please keep in mind language is a definite barrier (ex. asking for anything more than the basics will likely not get you any answer). Having a large party in that tatami room is nice, but it is not the best idea during Friday & Saturday nights peak time... let's just say it can be very chaotic.  With that being said, I love their food. It's my friend's favorite place for ramen and Japanese homecooking. They have some sushi but not a big selection. Personally I prefer nigiri and sashimi.  They have a Japanese menu - I found out from my parents' Chinese friends. Again communicating with the waitstaff is difficult but it's worth the work to order something different.",

I'm not a sushi fan, but I can eat teriyaki chicken and veggies anywhere.  He said he hadn't been in years and was curious to see if they were still as awesome as he remembered.  They were.  He got 4 or 5 different types of rolls and all were good, but he said octopus is one of the best tests of sushi.  He said it was a smidgen chewy, but it's octopus.  The teriyaki chicken was good, but it came with soup, salad and egg salad... no grilled veggies like I'm used to.  It was tasty though.    Our young waiter was super nice and accommodating (this Asian food nerd needed a fork), and he even bowed to say thank you when we left.  I would've never tried this place without the fella's suggestion since it's in a strip mall and the sign wasn't even lit when we got there, but it was very warm, inviting and unassuming with great food.",

    "text": "I finally found some legitimate tonkotsu ramen in Charlotte! It wasn't bland or watery and the pork (chashu?) was savory and delicious. I would definitely come back, though it is a little far out from the city (20 min drive).  You'll notice that the interiors of this restaurant make a particular effort to imitate a japanese home. There's a private dining room, which appears to be a small compartment with traditional tatami mats, sliding doors and pillows.The owners are also japanese, which is always a good sign in my books if you're looking for some lip-smacking ramen.   The menu offers a variety of delicacies from Japan, ranging from potato croquettes (with the delicious bulldog brand sauce) to gyoza and even mini fried crabs. Ramen is by far, the best dish on the menu and you even get a choice between the broths, soy, miso, tonkotsu etc.  The process for making tonkotsu broth is incredibly laborious and takes a lot of skill to perfect. I would say Musashi does the japanese broth justice by delivering the almost-creamy texture of the broth, filled with the rich flavor of pork. The soup also has a great milky-color. Unfortunately the noodles aren't hand made and you can tell they're more of an upgraded version of instant ramen noodles. However, this does not deter from the overall experience of eating a hot bowl. I didn't leave one drop!  The restaurant serves alcohol, but not past a certain hour (like 9 or 10), so you can enjoy a range of japanese beers and saki. Perfect accompaniment to dinner. Prices are very reasonable and the hospitality is fantastic. Food is served in a timely fashion and everything tastes phenomenal.   I'm already looking forward to the next time I come back!  4/5",

Both of which are truly amazing! Them miso ramen always has such tender pork in it, and the broth is fantastic!  My last visit (which was last Thursday), I finally got to sample their sushi. I have some Unagi (BBQ'ed Eel) and some Ebi (Cooked shrimp with some vinegar). I had NEVER had Unagi and Ebi that was this flavorful! The Ebi had the perfect amount of vinegar taste to it, and the Unagi had a wonderful BBQ sauce on it. The green tea they serve is always hot and a great way to compliment any meal.  The atmosphere includes a private section that is like a traditional Japanese Restaurant. it is closed off by some sliding doors. It also has  a hole under the table for you to place your legs when you sit.  The rest of the restaurant is brightly lit and a cozy feel to it.  The Staff is always friendly and kind, and you really could not ask for any better. They always feel very attentive to their customers. If your glass of tea is nearly empty, someone will be by in a few minutes to ask if you want more and then refill it.  Musashi is my favorite Japanese Restaurant in all of North Carolina. It is a shame it is so far away from me, but it's worth the trip when I am in the area. if you are looking for some fantastic sushi, tempura, or ramen, this is the place to go!",

    "text": "I used to like Musashi back in the days I lived in Charlotte. My Japanese teachers would tell me to go here and a lot of people who knew about the culture would recommend here. I remember my first time at Musashi I saw the most Japanese people in Charlotte ever and I started to believe that it must be the closest one to have the authentic taste.  Well so from my old memories I visited again with my mom but only to prove myself wrong.  The lady wasn't so friendly but I don't mind she was like that all the time. We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I don't remember, a tempura udon, and a chicken katsu.   I got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making? There was no delicacy. I was surprised when he handed me the dish. I obviously wasn't happy to see the result. The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice. It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab. The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri, or rice ball.  Then my chicken katsu and my mom's udon came out. The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting, nothing more nor nothing less. Rice, chicken, salad, additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad? and miso soup. It was good. Just normal chicken katsu. Not so crispy this time. The portion is pretty big. My mom liked the udon. The broth was clear and light color, the tempuras came out on a separate plate. Tempuras were just ok.   The sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine. I don't know if I'll comeback when I'm in town again. Maybe to get the katsu if I crave some teishoku style meal bc its my comfort food. But definitely no sushi at Musashi. I just want to say that just because it's owned by Japanese don't automatically assume that it'll be good.",

We were greeted by an older lady (assuming she was the owner), not the warmest greeting we had ever received. Few minutes had passed, the server came to take our drink order. We ordered large hot sake & a bottle of Sapporo. The Sapporo came out quickly but the sake came about 10 minutes after. Seemed like he had to heat the sake in a microwave. Fine, I thought got to myself since we were the 1st customer, maybe the sake machine wasn't turn on. We ordered edamame & fried squid legs. They were both just ok, nothing really stood out. For the main course, we ordered Tom Katsu Ramen & a sushi roll. For the ramen, this is legit!  The broth is light & rich (not thick like other place). Only complaint was an overcooked egg. The roll?  Wife ate all of it since it had eel & I didn't really care for.  She wanted to order more so we ordered maguro, ika, hamachi, spider roll, futo maki. Nothing was short of excellence!  Don't mind the way the sushi chef cut the fish, the quality was out of this world. This had to be the best quality we ever had (if you look at my review, we had also tried Nobu's Aspen. You know we are foodies!). We kept ordering like 4 round of sushi total, all of which were the best. Overall, if you rate this place less than 5 stars, you are crazy!",

It's located in a shopping center (with Food Lion).   The atmosphere is small with humble interior design. There are approximately 4 booths with high backs and hard bottoms with worn out cushions.   The greeting was all smiles. The service wasn't fast, but not too slow either. Our drinks were always full and the server was very friendly.  The sushi list was limited, but priced well. The spicy tuna roll was very good. Do not order the teriyaki chicken unless you like two marinated chicken breasts with sauce on top served with a cup of rice and a side of lettuce with ginger dressing for $12. Very disappointing. The restaurant was fairly busy, so I'm sure they have better dishes. I'll have to go back and try some of the noodle items.",

We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers [tofu was divine...not overly cooked], then a sashimi platter, a ramen, an udon, a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly w/kimchee dish [an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe it's a Korean dish, but wonderfully prepared nevertheless]. None of the dishes were too sauce-heavy or overly fried and the soups/broths were not too salty. As a result, you could actually taste the food...what a concept!",

Venue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.  Sushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.  Presentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.    Sake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum.   Ramen - the soup was very tasty.    Overall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you.",

    "text": "Upfront disclosures: I am a sushi snob, and am extremely particular about my sushi.  I am going to break my review into two parts - Typical Japanese food and sushi.    Typical Japanese food: We ordered some pork shumai that were pretty good, but was served with a brown-wasabi-type paste.  It tasted like wasabi, but why the hell was it brown? We also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi.  The kimchi was very spicy, but good.  The pork was a bit tough.    They have a whole list of special appetizers, but only about 4 were translated into english.  My girlfriend asked for more translation, but the waiter told us we really wouldn't be interested in them, so we dropped the conversation on it.   My gut tells me this place has very good, and very authentic Japanese food, but I am not experienced enough in non-sushi Japanese food.    On to the sushi:  We chose this restaurant due to the reviews on Yelp.  We eat a ton of sushi and were excited to try a new place.    Musashi has a very small sushi menu.  There are few rolls to choose from, and a medium sized menu for sashimi and nigiri.    We ordered salmon and tuna nigiri.  The fish was cut rather sloppily, and my girlfriend is not convinced that we actually had salmon.  The salmon was all pink, no typical white-fat lines....  why?  The rolls come in pieces of 3, which I find weird.  I am typically used to larger rolls with 6 or 8 pieces.  It really felt that the food was made hours before and then served up, as the rice was cold and solid - not like sushi rolled right in front of you.   We have not been back.  If you're looking for really, really, really authentic Japanese food, I would head here and try.  if you're looking for a great sushi experience, I would try other places in the area.",

    "text": "The reason I'm giving Musashi a 4-star review is because I love their ramen noodles, as well as their appetizers.  They taste amazing!  However, the sushi is down right awful.  It's cold and tasteless, kind of like supermarket sushi.  After eating sushi at Musashi twice, I gave up.  So the only reason I go back is to have their amazing appetizers, and ramen noodles.  The service is quite cold and unfriendly.  I am not the type to want any chitchat between customer and server, but the ladies there are quite cold, unresponsive, and slow.  I prefer efficient service, no chit chat, no upselling.  They tend to ignore you, which is fine, until you want to leave, and they still ignore you.",

    "text": "This place will always have a place in my stoma....errr...heart.  I have been coming here since high school, and I had graduated in '05 (woot!).  No need to worry about parking as this cozy restaurant is nestled in a shopping center.  I like Musashi as it's small and intimate in there.  They have booths, tables, a small bar, but what I really like is to sit in their room.  It looks like you'd have to sit criss cross apple sauce style the whole time cause it looks like your sitting on the floor, but there is openings for you to hang your feet.  Make sure to take off your shoes before going into the room!  I prefer to go during lunch as I feel like I can get the most bang for my buck.  When you go in during lunch, make sure to look towards your right and you'll see A, B, C lunch options.  Those options aren't on the menu and change daily.    My favorite thing to get here is the Ton-Kat-Su.  Man on man!  If I had to chose a meal I had to eat everyday for the rest of my life, this would be it.  It never disappoints!  And the salad that comes with it tastes so delicious due to their salad dressing!  If you think you can't get more salad dressing...YOU CAN!  I usually ask the younger guy server and he brings me a bottle to put more dressing on to my heart's delight!  The staff here is really nice and you'll always see the same familiar faces when coming in.  Come check them out!  I promise you'll enjoy their food!",

    "text": "Waiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before. It was rather salty instead.  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback? In any case, I'm not giving Musashi up yet since it's close to home cooking.   03-03-17 (A Friday Dinner) Disappointed. It was packed tonight. Had to wait about 15 mins for a table. Then, had to wait 45-50 for our food. But, the waiting wasn't the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile. WRONG.   The first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right:  cut thick n all the same size. I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA. No MSG. No thirst after the meal. And, the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi, not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco.   Tonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl, NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon. I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters? Hmm, I guess I'm ole fashion n lived in Japan too long.   I also ordered three uni sashimi. Hey! What's with the same price of $3.50 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi. This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi!!! But, I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi quality.  We were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG, lots n lots.   The tempura shrimp was perfect, not doughy or undercooked.   Still, since it's near, I'm not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next time.   06/24/17 Party of four n I was the one to suggest Musashi tonight BUT my tekka don came after everyone else finished their dinner. Granted it's crowded tonite got but still. Even the newly arrived ppl sitting next to us got their dinner b4 me",

I ordered the uni and salmon nigiri and that turned out to be barely OK. But what was quite off-putting was the $2.95 cost PER piece of salmon nigiri. I'd expect it's more like $4.50 to $5 for two pieces. So for $2.95 per piece of nigiri salmon to be rated as good, it's going to have to be pretty good, and unfortunately I'd rank it as even less than average. It's soft, pink, non-fatty and flavor-less flesh was sub-par compared to what I'm used to having. And I'll say that this one experience with this particular order does overall color my opinion. Perhaps there are things that are better choices here.",

    "text": "Super authentic casual Japanese restaurant.  Its accessible bento boxes and katsu dishes earn it plaudits, but the more rarefied fish (both grilled and rare) are what attract me.    The staff is Japanese and the walls are covered in Japanese baseball regalia near the sushi bar.  They take some time to warm up, but the servers and sushi chefs will eventually crack a smile.  The crowd is fairly brutal ordering a motley assortment of spicy rolls and fried dishes, but I suppose that's unsurprising.  Musashi is very casual, and so one needs to excuse the floppy menus, powdered wasabi and pink ginger.   Where they spend their money is carrying an assortment of fish.  Here's a rundown on what I had:  - Sashimi platter - I ordered a la cart a large sampling, but you can do one piece each so everything's very small portion wise.   As I said...authentic! - Anago - delicious, buttery - ika - squid was a highlight, very light and with a touch of crunch - surf clam - also delicious, I was feeling their bivalves.   They cater to the Japanese palette - tako - fresh and delicately flavorful.  I chomped on it with some shiso leaf and lemon which added zest   - ebi - slightly more flavorful than usual - saba - marinated and tasty - hamachi, sake, hirame, maguro - fairly standard although the salmon was better than expected - ikura - I got this sushi style and was delighted by the freshness and the sushi rice is great here.  A good touch of mirin and served slightly above room temperature.    I thought the knife work could have been prettier with the sashimi, however, the selection and relative freshness were both very good.  They didn't have any special fish such as toro - they said that specials come in during the weekends.   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently.    - hamachi Kama - very fresh, not previously frozen, cooked with some interesting spices  - mackerel - grilled and salted to perfection.  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty, juicy interior with a crisp skin - sanma - a little bit of a pain to eat, since I don't do the guts, however, some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fish",

Curry, I m suspecting that they use the curry blocks you buy from market, but nonetheless it tastes good.  But it's pricey for its serving.  Ramen is still not the best I had.  They use lean pork.  The broth is just ok.  The whole thing is average but not overly disappointed.  I m a big fan of ramen, and I rate this over yama in midwood and futo buta.  Need to try the yume bistro next.",

The staples to Japanese food are rice .which was good and seafood which was of mediocre quality. Most portions were small and pricey and not impressive. The limited lunch menu left a lot to be desired with many popular items only on the dinner menu such as teriyaki salmon, sushi, ramen etc. we had to ask for sushi menus which seemed to be a rare exception?   We may try dinner or carry out hesitantly and try to naviagate the good parts of their menu if they let us. Good luck to Masushi and their customers.",

And the lady didnt even give us water for frist 15mins and before we even finished eat she handed us a check... Not even buffet places hand yoh5check before u ask..... And we didnt even stay more than 40mins total. And didnt want to stay any longer..... I would give this place 0 star if i could....",

Musashi seated us promptly but soon thereafter was told any sushi or sashimi would take  a min of 40min!!! My parents of course said it was ok and ordered a bento box. I ended up eating nothing and felt like so bummed out that I couldn't order half the menu. Never eating Japanese in Charlotte ever again!!",

They have both tonkatsu ramen and also miso ramen. Buddy of mine has the latter and i think it is better than the tonkatsu ramen. The tonkatsu is good, but the broth of the miso ramen looked so rich and flavorful.  I had a few pieces of sashimi but the plan is to go back for more.",

Very clean restaurant, including the bathroom, which had a Bidet. Wow! I was in shock. The only tip I have for the restaurant is to lessen the amount of salt in the ramen broth and to make sure the pork is more tender. Otherwise an excellent option!",

Their fishes are always on point...when you eat a sushi roll or chirashi bowl it should blend together and give you a satisfying taste!!!  If you eat sashimi and the restaurant serve you with ice underneath then just leave cuz they don't know what the hell they're doing...  Yes, they deserve all 5 stars for their foods!!!",

My Hornet Roll was very good and the tuna and yellowtail rolls were also very good.  The staff is super nice and the quaint little paper room was great to have our group.

My grandparents came from China to visit me and i thought it will be nice to bring them to an authentic Japanese restaurant to have lunch. We arrived 10 mins before they open, and waited to get in. after its opened we sat down and ordered right away. I never thought about them being racist or any sort until today. People that arrived 20 mins after us got their food in 5 mins when we got the exact same thing, and still after that we waited another 20 mins til we finally got our food. I didnt believed grandma when she said they are being racist because of the histories and current events between China and Japan, but i have no better explanations. I'm super disappointed.",

I asked for shrimp sauce or white sauce, they didn't have any. I was kind of disappointed. Luckily my friend ordered some sushi and hers came with wasabi and ginger so I just stole hers. What it all really boils down to is, how good is that eel? Let me tell you, it's one of the most heavenly BBQ grilled things I've put in my mouth! The eel was cut to perfection, huge portions might I add. In fact, it's hard to find places that serve such huge pieces of eel that aren't cut up. Because it was cooked whole, it makes the eel that much more tender. If you've never had eel, you must try it! It almost taste like a flakey fish such as tilapia, grilled with eel sauce, and the rice just soaks up all the deliciousness.  But seriously, I need shrimp sauce or white sauce. Next time I may order it Togo and get shrimp sauce from somewhere else. Problem solved!",

There are fancier LOOKING sushi places to be found in this town for sure, but purist Japanese sushi that caters to a very Japanese and Asian crowd? You'd be hard pressed to find more than a few of these at all.  The lunch special is great, especially the Chirashi Sushi which is pieces of sashimi on top of a bowl of seasoned sushi rice. The tempura appetizer is perfect with just the right amount of coating and a real ponzu dipping sauce with daikon radish in it.   This is not a place for fancy Americanized rolls. Order traditional stuff or just watch what the regulars are eating.",

    "text": "I am sad to give this a 3 Star review, particularly as it is one of the few authentic Japanese restaurants in NC.  I recently went there for lunch and the service was harried and rude (very unusual).  The male waiter did his best, but he was overworked.  The older Japanese woman, would deliver food without even a word or eye contact.  I noticed a visually impaired woman waiting for her meal, she was there before me. And she was still waiting after I had finished my meal.  The employees ignored her and when she was finally able to get the waiter's attention, to say she was still waiting, he brusquely replied, \"we're busy, it's coming.\"  I was waiting for my check when she finally received her meal and she asked if they happened to have a To Go menu.  The Japanese lady rudely said No and walked away.  It was very uncomfortable. I wanted to order sushi with the Tenpura bento I got but was told it would take a very long time, so that was a bust.  Anyway, the Tenpura was good/no complaints as far as the food, but I don't plan on returning because of the way they treated a handicapped customer.  Disappointing and very unlike most Japanese people I know.",

He's been looking for authentic Japanese cuisine ever since (for 36 years) and found it here!  The Gyouza (pork dumplings) and Pork Katsu was great! I had the Tempura Shrimp; not as adventurous. At the next table saw the \"Bento box\" - a wonderful variety & looked amazing! Casual place, in a strip plaza; easy to miss.  Prices are reasonable, service was great and quality is excellent! We can't wait to return.",

I highly recommend coming here for lunch, which for me, means my Saturday lunches are usually here. They usually do 3 \"specialty\" lunch boxes: Box A, B and C. A is usually a unique, homemade-esque Japanese dish. Sometimes it is katsu curry. Other times it is ramen. Sometimes it's a little of both and other times it's a bento box. Box B is usually a bento box with a wide variety of sushi dishes and Box C is usually a chirashi bowl. My usually order the A as it is always unique, authentic and delicious. Other recommendations are: katsu-don (katsu with egg and onions over rice), grilled mackerel, chicken katsu and agedashi tofu.",

Maybe its due to its small, unassuming location in an aged shopping center anchored by Food Lion. More than likely though, it because of its close proximity to one of our all time fav Chinese joints, Taipei South. Whatever the reason, I am happy to be back.  The simply decorated dining area is small and tightly seated. The sushi bar seats four or five. Every seat was packed (primarily by Asian clientele which was a good sign) on our arrival and with virtually no foyer or waiting area, waiting inside can be a problem. Fortunately our wait was short.  Service was friendly and attentive. My wife and I both ordered the Sushi Bento Box lunch special for $11. It was accompanied by miso soup, and everything was fresh and delicious. Our favorite item was the spicey tuna. We plan to return much sooner this time!",

Cue to a few weeks ago when I found out that my new job's field office was only six minutes from here. Goodbye packed lunch, hello Musashi!  Yes, the inside is small, but don't let that fool you. The service is always reliable and the menu is satisfying. During my last visit I sat at the bar and ate the Tempura-Udon dish. It was simple, but still so perfect. The prices are reasonable for a lunch visit, but if you're looking for dinner this is also a great option. If you work in this area and want something different than just your average Chipotle or Panera I beg you to visit Musashi. I promise you will enjoy it!",

    "text": "This was my parents' favorite Japanese restaurant in all of Charlotte, so I used to be a frequent diner here. Since their passing years ago, I avoided this place because it brought back too many memories...but tonight, I decided to brave it out.  Despite the fact several years have passed by, the place looked about the same. Small, cozy...very old-school Japanese? Almost forgot how brightly lit the place was though!  My parents always used to say that this was truly good Japanese food...and I agree! You can always tell how authentic the food is by counting the number of natives. In the past, I remember that on many days we dined here (usually for lunch), it felt as if I was in Japan...as there were so many Japanese diners here. Well, things haven't changed. Tonight, there must have been at least 5 tables full of Japanese diners.   Honestly, I've never had a bad meal here, and tonight was no exception. Both my husband and I had their Tonkatsu Bento Box, which was amazing as ever...and quite a steal considering it comes with just about everything, including soup, salad, rice, fried tempura, dumplings, spring roll and even several forms of veggies...and of course, your choice meat! All this under $20!! My parents used to love their Udon dishes, and I hear their Ramen dishes are good too. And don't forget to try their Green Tea (or Red Bean) Ice Cream...THE best, authentic flavors in that as well!  This is a small, family operated business, and I noticed that the mom and son (possibly their dad behind the sushi counter?) were still here. This place has most definitely become one of Charlotte's staple...and I think it may be one of the oldest Japanese restaurants in town as well...again, with good reason!  Based on the consistent, high quality of the foods here, I can't give them anything less than 5 stars. Besides, they served my parents well...and kept them happily fed for many, many years. Anyway, now that I've revisited this old \"haunt\" of ours, am likely to return more often.",

    "text": "I've been eating at Musashi for 5 years and it's the best Japanese restaurant in all of Charlotte! First off, the restaurant is very authentic and their food is always consistently superb. Their sushi is the best sushi in all of Charlotte. Their sushi chef is amazing and makes all the sushi on the spot and the ingredients they use in the sushi is always 100% fresh.  Throughout 5 years of being a regular, I've had a large variety of items from their menu and I have to say their Katsu Don on their lunch menu is the best thing on there. The Katsu Don consists of fried pork cutlets with eggs and rice. It's a great deal at $8.75 and the portion is enough to fill you up.   Other great deals for lunch time are their lunch specials. Depending on the day you go, their lunch special may vary. But lunch A and B always include delicious ramen and some kind of rice dish at only $11. Their lunch menu is at such a great value that I almost feel bad for not paying them more for such high quality food!   For dinner, their portions are much larger and include sides but if you're willing to spend an extra few bucks for lunch or dinner the Una Don is my personal favorite. It has eel and rice and is definitely worth the price ($15 for lunch and $18)   I definitely recommend Musashi to those who love Japanese cuisine! Don't forget to try their legendary sushi too! Make sure to account for wait time on busy Friday and Saturday nights. Even with a wait time on busy nights, the 10/10 food is always worth it!",

Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback? In any case, I'm not giving Musashi up yet since it's close to home cooking.   03-03-17 (A Friday Dinner) Disappointed. It was packed tonight. Had to wait about 15 mins for a table. Then, had to wait 45-50 for our food. But, the waiting wasn't the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile. WRONG.   The first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right:  cut thick n all the same size. I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA. No MSG. No thirst after the meal. And, the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi, not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco.   Tonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl, NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon. I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters? Hmm, I guess I'm ole fashion n lived in Japan too long.   I also ordered three uni sashimi. Hey! What's with the same price of $3.50 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi. This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi!!! But, I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi quality.  We were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG, lots n lots.   The tempura shrimp was perfect, not doughy or undercooked.   Still, since it's near, I'm not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next time.   06/24/17 Party of four n I was the one to suggest Musashi tonight BUT my tekka don came after everyone else finished their dinner. Granted it's crowded tonite got but still. Even the newly arrived ppl sitting next to us got their dinner b4 me   02/14/19 Valentines  Amazingly not busy tonight but yet my Tekka Don was so tasty... u know that fresh sashimi tuna taste? Mmmmm. Tho, my sweet date's bento looked a bit scant but he says \"u know the Japanese only eat 80% full so that's y they live longer.\"  Anyway, I did enjoy my dinner very much. I'm also glad it wasn't crowded!!!",

Add appetizers such as the Agedashi Tofu or soft shell crab if you think you can eat more.

We were seated at the bar and ordered soft shell crab roll, donkotsu ramen and katsu jyu(pork cutlet with egg).   After soft shell crab roll was served first, we waited for 30minutes for other dishes. They said it was a little busy but they should have managed the kitchen in a better way on the weekend. The serving lady was kind enough to bring complimentary edamame while we were waiting.  The ramen was served and soup was very rich but salty.(or was my day bad as the cook put more salt by accident?!)I liked the noodle though. Katsu jyu was katsu-don in a bento box style. Katsu was okay, not that crispy enough. I maybe expected too much(authentic japanese ramen and donkotsu) as I heard the owner was Japanese. They can do better.  It leaves a lot to be desired. 3stars for the food and 2stars for the service.",

The prices at lunch are definitely reasonable especially for the ramen and the bento box's, but my last visit I indulged in some pork cutlets and miso ramen! The cutlets were perfectly cooked, having a crispy outer layer from the Panko, and a firm, but succulent interior.  The ramen never fails to disappoint and even though I may have gotten the miso ramen this time around, the shoyu ramen (soy sauce ramen) is definitely one of my favorites at Musashi!",

They piled up the salad (possibly to make the box look full) of a lot of romaine lettuce with some kind of soy dressing (which was not bad tasting).  The worst though was the miso soup.  Hub and I had miso soup and we each had only 3 tiny cubes of silken tofu on each bowl.  They were so scrimpy on the tofu that it was almost hilarious.  Just how much is a pack of silken tofu.  Terriyaki chicken was just so-so.  Will not go back again.",

Be aware that it's very small and the line for lunch often extends out the door and down the sidewalk by the time the doors open for lunch at noon, but the sushi is outstanding- very traditional, so no pineapple chocolate mocha smoothie rolls, just very high quality beautifully prepared sushi, sashimi, and a selection of other soups and traditional Japanese country and street food.   As other reviews have noted, the restaurant is small and definitely a bit dated, so be prepared for a pretty plain interior, somewhat crowded seating, and some supplies stored around the edges. Lunch is only served from 12-2, so it can be a pretty packed and hectic, but dinner is much less crowded than lunch, and much more relaxed. However, the people are great- sit at the bar and talk to Rocket while he's making your food- the food is great, and it's definitely worth putting up with some of the eccentricities of the place.",

I was originally looking for a more generic Japanese meal like teriyaki chicken with broccoli, fried rice and shrimp sauce. The food they serve was not what I expected but was still delicious. It seemed like more authentic Japanese and was very fresh and tasted amazing. The chicken teriyaki was served with soup,salad, rice and noodles. The most outstanding part was the service. They went over and above to make sure we were taken care of! I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "I acquired a taste for Japanese food during my frequent business trips to South East Asia and Japan. In India, it is impossible to find good Japanese food without paying eye-popping prices. When I moved to the US in 2009, I'd expected to be much better off. Columbia, SC where I worked was not exactly the big city I'd hoped to live in and dining options were very limited. So Charlotte is where I ventured for some variety.  Musashi is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte. I used to stop by here every time I drive through Charlotte or would come to the Charlotte airport to pick up my girlfriend. I moved to Charlotte in 2010 and thought that I'd be a regular visitor after that. The 10-11 mile drive from uptown where I stay meant that I actually visited them even less frequently than when I lived in Columbia.  I'd say that the Sushi has gotten better here from what I remember from my 1st visit in 2009. But the real treats here are the Ramen (love the Tonkatsu Ramen) and the Japanese menu (my faves are the Fish Liver and the Beef & Tofu). Ingredients are top-notch. For example, just try the fried squid - perfectly cooked and the best quality that I've had anywhere including Singapore.   My girlfriend had been very relucatant to try Japanese food because she was always worried about using chopsticks. One visit to Ippudo NYC convinced her that she needed to eat more Japanese food. We went to Musashi twice this weekend when she flew down to visit me :-) Sat lunch and Sun dinner! So now she is a convert too!  It is not cheap. But I'd say that it is great value for money - you do get more than what you pay for! Excellent service, nice traditional kind of ambience that is way more than the outside strip mall exterior might suggest. And most of all, fantastic food that I will miss when I move from Charlotte in April :-(",

Service is always good, server is always smiling and very friendly, she made a joke to my friends about how i will finish all the food that they dont eat if they ordered too much lol. however the price is not cheap 2 entrees and a appetizer can easily run ur bill up to bout 40 + tips and tax ur looking at around 50 at dinner time. but u know what? u get what u paid for, although i can't afford eating here every week but its totally worth it when i do come with friends and family  :)  on a side note, REAL japanese people eat there ALL the time. there is always atleast one table with japanese eating there. hey...if Japanese are eating japanese food here.... how bad can it be?

This was a huge letdown - seems another sushi restaurant with a different name is taking its place - will just have to wait and see how it turns out.  Anyway we went to Musashi as a second choice and it was not nearly as nice as Mizuho. Atmosphere is cluttered and tables are too close together for any privacy. I ordered Sushi Deluxe, which was OK and came with miso soup but no salad as most places serve, and a Kirin beer. Wife ordered individual nigiri with spicy tuna roll - also OK. And daughter ordered teriyaki chicken - poor at best (chicken breast apparently baked with sauce poured on top, very plain salad, small amount of noodles,and bowl of rice). The girls chose water to drink. Despite below average restaurant and food, service was very good.  $75! Sushi is expensive and that is OK, but this was too much for below average atmosphere and food. Add a tip and the meal was nearly $90 - last trip to Musashi!  So the search is on for good sushi in South Charlotte!",

Waitress were impolite, unfriendly wearing some dirty shoes which should be already a red flag sign, but I was hungry, and I thought \"not a big deal\". Well, it turned out to be a big deal. Where are the traditional appropriate for any type of services smiles? Where is the traditional Japanese hospitality you see in other restaurants? It was anything like that!!!  When a hostess found out that I am alone she set me at the small uncomfortable table while the restaurant was nearly empty.  I asked to be seated at another table, and hostess started arguing. I repeat, the restaurant was nearly empty, and who says, if you come alone you don't deserve a better seat? I looked at the menu, and asked questions about some dishes, but waitresses did not speak English, and they could not explain me anything. I ordered a CHICKEN TERIYAKI. The dish looked very unattractive: big chunks of lettuce, and  potato salad which I did not order, and nobody asked me, if I want one on a side; the taste was even worse!!! I ate CHICKEN TERIYAKI in many other Japanese restaurants before, and this is a delicious dish, but not in this terrible place. On the top of that I saw a bug crawling across the table. I killed it, and I called a manager. Waitress started arguing with me again!!  I did not see any smiles, and I did not hear \"I'm sorry\". Waitress/hostess was rude. I felt sick after that ordeal. I could not touch my meal, and I left this nasty, bugs infested place hungry, and frustrated about a horrible experience, and my wasted time.  I would rate this place the worst rating.",

While it is in a strip mall, once we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and told to sit anywhere. The first thoughts we had were of Japan while looking at the decor. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Absolutely no complaint about service here!   We have been here twice. The first time, we both got the tonkatsu ramen with a gyoza appetizer. The gyoza were perfect - served with a chile oil and soy sauce. The ramen was delicious and fresh with mushrooms, half an egg, three pieces of pork that were very tender, a piece of fish cake, and noodles with a lovely chewy texture. The broth tasted of every one of those things - a warm, inviting flavor.   The second visit, I got the tonkatsu ramen again, while my daughter got the tonkatsu bento box. Her box came with a whole tonkatsu, 4pc. California roll, 2 shrimp tempora, 4 pc. vegetable tempora, a seaweed salad, miso soup, a small salad, a shrimp dumpling, a pork dumpling, and an egg roll. Needless to say, we had enough food for lunch the next day. Those two meals, plus sweetened tea for two, came to almost 42.00. For the atmosphere, the friendly service, and the authentic food, I can't wait to go back and try the river eel over rice! Please don't pass this one by!",

    "text": "We decided to try Musashi on Friday night after reading some other Yelp reviews and I'm happy to say it was a great experience!  Everyone in there seemed like regulars (several were commenting that it was busier than usual on a Friday night), and some seemed to have \"their table.\"  Just like another reviewer said, I always take it as a good sign when I visit an ethnic restaurant and see it full of people from that ethnicity.  We were definitely in the minority at Musashi and so I knew the food would be very authentic (and awesome).  The service was a little slow and disorganized, so that's the only reason I can't give Musashi 5 stars.  I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner that came with rice and miso soup and it was fantastic.  We also had the vegetable spring roll appetizer.  My food arrived to the table about 15 minutes prior to my husband's sushi.  Would've been nice to eat together but it wasn't a deal breaker.  Like I said, a little disorganized but otherwise very good.    We will definitely go back to Musashi - great food, authentic experience and well priced.",

They don't answer their phone any time of day and don't return calls so it's nearly impossible to make a reservation unless you happen to be willing to stop by before your dinner engagement.    But it's a nice small restaurant for impromptu sushi dinners for couples or a party of 3 or 4.  That's probably their focal point anyway.  They do have tatami mat seating and a fairly broad, if expensive, sake selection.    I would immediately give them four or even five stars if service was a little more organized and purposeful and if the staff could be significantly friendlier.  There are only two servers even on Saturday nights during prime time, so perhaps that is the source of the problem anyway.  Be prepared for long waits during your meal if you go with a group of 5 or more.",

    "text": "Musashi's is our go to spot for authentic Japanese. The staff is owned and run by a Japanese family -- huge plus, especially nowadays where you've got all these \"japanese\" restaurants run by Chinese, Korean or the East Asian people. It's always a good sign when you see other Japanese diners dining there. The ambience is simple and unassuming, allowing the food to speak for itself. The food here is AUTHENTIC! The sushi chef is intimidating looking and very serious about what he does. The sushi and sashimi are all very good - chirashi bowl, sashimi a la carte (uni, yellowtail, salmon roe, salmon, tuna). Their rolls taste fantastic too. We always go with the spicy yellowtail, Cali rolls and soft shell crab with avocado. Their cooked items are delicious too: grilled mackerel and fried squid legs apps, any of their ramen and udon bowls or their soba noodles. Pair any of these items with some sake or beer.  FYI - They take reservations and have a large separate room (shoes must be taken off) with two tables that can seat 8-10 ppl each. For these tables, you sit on the floor and legs can hang below. They have set lunch and dinner hours, and never pick up the phone unless they're open and not too busy. They open at 5:30 for dinner and we've arrived at 5:15 to see a line outside.  Have an urge for some quality and authentic Japanese in Charlotte? Look no further.",

If you are looking to order fancy drinks and Americanized California rolls, this is not the place for you. Go to Nikko in South End for the Upscale experience and super expensive Sushi.  I believe this is now the only place in Charlotte where you can order really good Bento Boxes and authentic Ramen Noodle bowls. Mai Japanese Restaurant used to have good Bento boxes when they were at South Blvd. location but they have abandoned Bento Box since they have moved to Colony Road location.    Sushi here are very fresh and there are plenty of Japanese appetizers on the menu in English and Japanese. The service is typical of small family run restaurant.  They tend to get overwhelm when it is too busy.    Mango Mochi is our children favorite dessert. We try to go here once or twice a month.",

It is obviously a favorite of the Japanese-American population of Charlotte!  After many good Yelpers guided us to this spot, we decided finally to give it a try.  A busy spot and a small restaurant.  It did not appear that they took reservations; I'm not sure.  There are two American style kotatsu tables that appear to seat up to six.  Dress in layers; this tiny joint gets cozy.  We plan to try more sushi varieties; it's right in line with prices from other places.  It's very fresh, straightforward presentation.  Timing on food coming out is decent; we didn't wait forever.  We had a couple of rolls and they were good.  Noodle bowls could be a bit more generous or perhaps a bit less expensive.  My $11 tempura udon by itself would have left me wanting.  Next time I will probably try a bento box.  My husband had the tonkatsu ramen and was pretty satisfied.  The service staff is so very nice and cheerful.  If you know Japanese (my husband does) they love to make conversation.",

The food is awesome. The people are awesome. The place rocks!  To all the people giving this place 3 stars and complaining that the chicken was not great and the salad should have had ginger dressing.....this is an authentic Japanese restaurant. Not the American Hibachi down the street. Japanese is not a big room with large grills with guys flinging food all over the place creating small fires. That is an American Invention and THIS is what Japanese food tastes like and how it is served. But then again American Stupidity on what other cultures food tastes like knows no bounds....TACO BELL?  The service is always perfect. I love the staff there. They let me practice my Japanese and are always excited when I get it right. To the people saying the \"service is slow\", The service is slower because you are supposed to talk to each other and enjoy your company and not scarf down your food like a couple of baka gaijin. It's Japanese!  Again hands down the best place in Charlotte to get authentic JAPANESE FOOD like it is served in Japan in every small town and small food/bar in the country. This is NOT American style Japanese it's AUTHENTIC!  !",

In my first few months I found myself in Charlotte, all alone on Yom Kippur, which is the jewish holiday where we fast for the entire day, thats right an entire day. Basically, the entire day you dream about what you are going ot eat for dinner, which makes it even more excruciating. By 8pm (1.5 hours past sun down) I decided on Musashi after a colleague reccomended it earlier, she had told me of a secret japanese menu, and fresh fish.  Well I can tell you this place has BOTH! And the best part, is the head chef there and owner, is quite japanese, and began his career in my home city's (Toronto) first ever sushi restaurant in the early 80s. Suffice to say, I was pretty sold after talking to this guy   The japanese menu is off the chain and features japanese favourites like broth meat and raw egg in a hot pot (not sure what the name of that is),  they are a little hesitant to let you order off of it but I've been 3 times and just asked the waitress what she reccomended and have never had a bad item.   Probably one of the best Sushi places in the city along with sushi guru, yet to try new zealand which i also heard was great.",

I'm a bit of a food purist - I feel that if you are going to eat Japanese food, than it had better be at a Japanese restaurant with a Japanese chef. The same can be applied to other ethnic cuisines; I mean if you were on vacation in France, would you honestly eat French food in France that is prepared by an American? No.  Ranting aside, Musashi has the best bowl of Ramen I've had since leaving Japan. Period. The wife's a la carte selections were also equally as tasty including the homemade dipping sauces - the effort they put in really makes the difference.   I've seen another review here on Yelp and I'll echo it here - you have to flag down your waitress and this is to be expected as it is how Japanese restaurants operate.  Don't knock them on service without understanding the culture.   I'll end the review with this: if you think Hibachi is Japanese food, then Musashi may not be for you; however, if you are seeking an authentic Japanese experience Izakaya  style, then look no further.",

Umm if you even slightly know anything about Japanese food, go here! You will not be disappointed. Both their sushi and dishes are delicious!   Yes it is True that the language can be a barrier if you try to edit things, but there is a younger guy who works there that is helpful and speaks perfect english. I personally am learning Japanese, but I just go with the flow!  On the downside, trying to call during hours in between openings (i.e. 2-5pm) is to no avail, and so reservations (highly recommended) are harder to make ahead of time. I would suggest calling when they are open towards the evening.   Anyway, try it!",

Yes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)  This place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign.    TIP: Get the lunch special A or B.  You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  The special is $8 and is plenty of food.  (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.)   To the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.  However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good?   (If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact, it's pretty good, considering.)   I also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient!   TIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.  Bottom Line:  If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.  Just a solid meal, run by a family you can tell knows what they're doing.",

The Chicken Katsu is what I laid my eyes upon and I was pleasantly surprised when it came out. A good portion of chicken with many veggie and fruit options; highly recommend.  The place is small. The service is courteous but slow. Those are negative remarks that only hold it back slightly. If you enjoy changing it up on your taste buds, check it out.",

    "text": "I asked the cashier at Hatoya for an authentic Japanese restaurant, she gave me Musashi.  My friend and I immediately wanted to check the restaurant out, only to find out that they open at 5:30pm..  We came back at 6:35pm.  Place - The establishment is small, but gosh it was packed on a Friday night at 6:45pm. One thing I have learned is to make reservations! It looked like almost more than half of the tables had \"Reserved\" signs.  There were people behind us waiting for a table.. some left.  Food - - Tonkotsu Ramen: I was craving for some ramen, and the ramen I had ordered was alright. I was hoping for the one I had tried in NewYork or the one in Houston.  The flavor of the pork Tonkotsu Ramen was there, but just missed the mark on presentation and other ingredients. Definitely better than the others I have been to around Charlotte.  - Tonkatsu Bento Box: My friend's husband loved his bento Tonkatsu box.  - Katsu Chicken Entree: My husband had the Katsu Chicken and it was alright.   - Salad: The salad ginger peanut dressing was good. - Off the menu Shrimp Tempura Roll: Just shrimp tempura and the roll.. no.. other veggies - what?!  Service - They are good about getting to you, when you ask for their service..  When they are busy, it may take them just a tad bit longer to get to you.  Price - Was alright, not too shabby, and reasonable at best.   So bottom line, I like the food... but I am in no dire need to come back. I would be happy to have their food at the Japanese Festival though.   I felt bad for the people who waited around the door for the next available seat/table.  My friends and I quickly paid for our dinner after we were done so they could be seated.",

The bento boxes give you a chance to sample a little of everything and they are delicious. My personal favorites are the gyoza and pork shumai.

    "text": "This is my second time here and both times the waitresses have been rude. Especially the older cock-eyed lady. We've waited for over an hour the first time I went and 40 minutes the second time. When I came in today I saw the tatami styled table was available so I asked one of the waitresses if we could sit at the bigger table/tatami styled table because we had a party of 7. Her response was \"uh no. \" I didn't understand why so I decided to ask another waitress if the table was reserved and she mumbled an answer and walked away. The first time I went, after waiting an hour, one of the waitresses called us up to come and be sat but then she forced us to go and wait longer because another group that was already sat wanted to move to the table we were supposed to be sat at. It ended up being extremely chaotic because the entrance was already packed and the minute we moved to come sit at the table then the line moved up and we were forced to stand in the middle of the restaurant because we couldn't be seated. It seems as though they tend to favor other Japanese people more and try to get them seated as quickly as possible. They need a bigger entrance, a hostess, and better management. They didn't give us enough menus or silverware and didn't ask what we wanted to drink. The floor is extremely sticky, not sure why I guess they don't clean the floors. As for the food, I really did enjoy the food but I may not be back again because of the horrible service and rude waitresses. If you still decide to go, try the tenpura lunch or katsu-jyu. I tried to give them a second chance but I've never felt this disrespected before. Maybe I will try again far far far far far far far far into the future. Not happy at all. Not only that but every one at the table except one person got their food and he had to wait an extra 25 minutes for his. I also had to go grab a napkin and a pair of chopsticks myself because they didn't provide me with one. How disappointing.",

    "text": "Well, here goes my first review to chronicle my life-long love affair with food. I had in mind trying something new because how awfully long some reviews turn out to be - kinda like the length of this introduction. So, bottomline, I'm going to begin with a five words or less review.   Authentic. Attentive. Explore the appetizers.  This place fills me with nostalgia. The menu selection and execution remind me of my mom's dishes and the local mom & pop establishments tucked away in the underbelly of Japan.  You won't get a show with your teppan yaki, but what you will get is authentic, and delicious Japanese food.   If you are looking to get past the more well known dishes and expand your experience with Japanese food, I'd recommend the agedashi dofu, grilled mackerel (get a side of rice with it), and nabe udon.   All in all after three times here, I've left with a feeling of happiness - due to some part of not having a rice cooker here nor a car to drive to the Japanese market - that hasn't surfaced in quite some time, even back home in Long Beach, CA.  The only disappointment was the tonkotsu ramen. The broth needs some work.   5 stars.",

    "text": "Tried this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend.  We had the vegetable tempura, tonkotsu ramen, and chicken katsu cutlet.  I will update this review as necessary after trying the sushi side of their menu.  Pros:  - The food here is authentic.  I am not Japanese, but this restaurant's dishes taste identical to those I tasted when visiting Osaka/Tokyo.  As far as I know, this place is the only restaurant in the Charlotte area with authentic ramen noodle soups. -It seems they make their own tonkatsu sauce.  It was not as sweet as the bottled version that is available from Asian grocery stores.  The perfectly balanced tonkatsu sauce was a pleasant surprise.  -Service was good, and food came out very quickly.  The entrees came out before we were finished with the tempura appetizer. -Price is reasonable, perhaps a touch high.  Cons:  -The restaurant space is cramped.  Musashi crams as many 2 and 4 person tables into the space that they can.  There is a large area dedicated for tatami room style dining.  That area was not in use and made the restaurant seem like a suboptimal arrangement/floorplan. -The restrooms are single person restrooms.  They are located behind the kitchen and when I checked the floors leading to the restrooms were sticky, presumably from spilled food/drink. -The portion sizes are not consistent.  The tempura appetizer(notably no onion rings) was about 7-8 small vegetables, which I consider to be small.  The chicken cutlet portion was gigantic, containing two chicken breasts along with two generous portions of sides.  My ramen was just the right size.",

The ingredients were fresh and my Nabeyaki Udon tasted good and was hot and savory. It just had no spice at all to it. Once I shook in a lot of the spice they brought with it, it became a decent meal. If this was available at pho prices, I would be back. However, with that dish costing $15+, I'd rather pick up some fresh bok choy and some Myojo Udon noodle packets and DIY udon at home.",

It has a tatami room where you can sit to eat and feel even more traditional (usually for big parties). To most, the staff doesn't seem so friendly which I think is a standard Japanese way of just staying out of your way. For me it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them. The cook was even nice enough to make me a special order of curry soba - which was great! I try to come back here every two weeks just to be in that authentic Japanese environment. The only setback is that I live so far from it.",

There was a line out the door and only one server so we waited over 20 minutes before even speaking to someone.  We were seated but only received one menu so we shared it.   We were served after four other tables that arrived after us.  We ordered tea and water and our server forgot my tea.  The tea seems powdered.   Husband got Shoyu Ramen, and I wanted chicken katsu curry, but the chicken katsu is $8, apparently it's five additional dollars for the curry sauce.  So i ordered the Tempura instead.   It was very good.  We also got pork shumai, but there was hard bone bits my husband almost cracked his tooth on, and the consistency of the rest of the shumai was complete mush.  The gyoza I recieved with my Tempura was very good.   We ordered an additional side of gyoza and those came with barely any sauce and were burned black on the bottom.  His noodles were very good, firm, stretchy, chewy, delicious.   Very good flavor in the broth.    We will be back to give this place another shot, they just seemed a bit too busy and a little understaffed.  Also, we wont order the shumai again, it just didn't seem right to us.",
