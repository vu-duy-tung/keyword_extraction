My only complaint is service is a little slow.  Our waitress was friendly and all.....but then to have another customer at the restaurant come up to us and tell us that she was at the bar saying we were probably going to \"stiff\" her pissed me off!  Why she thought that is beyond me, but we left her a tip over 20% and I left her a little note on the receipt that we knew what she said.  Needless to say we probably will not return because she turned a nice evening of pizza with our 2 year old daughter into a not nice ending!",

Also ordered an antipasto salad that was the bomb.  Prices were all very reasonable.  Love the vibe of the place, loved the food, loved the prices, and they are open till 2!!  What more do you need.

I kindly let her know our order was incorrect, she started yelling over me and wouldn't let me finish. I did my want a refund nor them bring other food out, just wanted to make them aware that order was incorrect in case someone else's order was the same. I finally decided to end conversation as she was so rude. Very disappointed in our food as well as how this was handled. She refused for me to speak with manager. We used to order something every week, we stopped about 3 months ago due to quality of good, decided to give another chance. This was the LAST chance. I hope they can get it together, it's a shame how it's being run into the ground and no one cares.",

We go in with very very few tables occupied and we sit down at two dirty tables for our group of six. The bar tender comes over and takes our drink and appetizers order and it comes out fairly quickly and was good at which time they took the dirty pizza pan from one of our tables but never wiped either of them.  We place our entree order and after 45 minutes and watching numerous to go orders and other customers receiving their food I went to the bar tender who looked into our order and said it was never printed and given to the cook staff. We never got any beverage refills even though the bar tender walked by us several times. But on a good note the table behind us who were regulars evidently by the way the bar tender and them talked to one another, their pizza smelled great.",

I Came here for lunch today like I normally do as a frequent customer and ordered a Philly cheesesteak... I noticed one of the Hispanic females in the back making other people's food with her bare hands and not stopping to wash them not one time. She then proceeded to grab the raw steak meat for my sandwich with no gloves on her hands and place it on the grill then grabbed my bread with her hands and sliced it... I was absolutely disgusted as she put my pickle in the box... Loaded my sandwich with cheese and all and not once washing her hands or putting on gloves! Very unsanitary!!! I told them I didn't want the sandwich and another person decided made me a new sandwich with gloves!!! I will not be going back to this place... I cannot believe they touch people's food with no gloves and when the cashier told the lady to put on gloves she argued with her and got an attitude and still didn't put on gloves and proceeded to touch other people's food!!! As well I never got an apology!!! Very rude and disgusting experience!!!",

Also ordered wings to go when I placed my order and after waiting for 15 minutes after eating my lunch I went up front and my wings were just sitting there with no intention of them bringing them to me.  So there some more time I won't get back.  Wings were bland and I asked for hot and the blue cheese was the consistency of milk, not good to say the least.  I hate giving bad reviews but hopefully they can learn and improve. Best of luck and I won't be going back",

    "text": "When my colleagues said this place has good cheese steaks, my ears perked and decided to check them out.    I haven't been in this space since it was Bellacino's which closed a while ago.  Carmella's certainly makes use of the space.  They kept some of Bellacino's tables but also added bar tables, booth seating and also a small bar where half of the kitchen used to be.  The menu is quite broad with sandwiches, pizza and Italian items.  But I was here for one reason, the Philly.  Theirs comes with specific items so if you don't want some items on it, you have to tell them so.  Who puts mayo on a cheesesteak?  yuck.  Anyway, opted for marinara sauce instead of mayo.  That's how I grew up with Phillys.   It also comes with your choice of fries, chips or slaw.  I went with fries.  The best thing about this sandwich is the bread.  I haven't tasted such good bread on a Philly since I moved south.  The meat was good but there seemed to be a shortage of it and it was smothered in so much cheese that it was hard to find the meat, sauce, onions and peppers. I didn't really care for the sauce.  It was too sweet but all the flavors together were decent and it created a soggy mess of the bread which is actually something I love in a Philly and something that is very hard to find.  Despite the flaws and because finding a decent cheese steak is so hard to find in the south, I'd still rank this one in my Top 5 in Charlotte.  The fries were decent too and the people were really friendly in here.  It might be worth another visit to try something else on the menu.",

Spicy, chewy, slightly salty and delicious.Finger lickin' good. Well drinks, 5 bucks, bottled domestics, $2.50. This is going to be one of my new Friday or Saturday night go-tos!",

About 10-15 (4 seat) tables to the right. 1 long booth that has 2 tables to them. The bar.... Well that's kinda cray. It's one 5 seat bar in front. You get to the second bar by going into what one may consider the kitchen. We saw a few ppl sitting there. At 1st we thought they were employees because of the location of the bar.   Very nice servers. I think they were the owners. (Maybe sisters. Idk) we didn't order any food but noticed a guy in the Val Hand Tossing pizza dough. And a family dressed in church clothes eating. And a few young ppl in there munching it up.   Pretty good lunch specials and drink specials.   They deliver & open til 2.",

They know our drinks and type of pizza we like before we even sit down.

    "text": "We were heading to trivia when the boyfriend remembered Carmella's has a wing special on Wednesdays... Well, it's basically .50 a wing, so it's not that special, but it's decent...   When you go to Carmella's, you walk in and the cash register is directly in front of you... You order and pay for your food and then you can seat yourself where you like... I went in, ordered 10 wings and 2 beers, paid and went to grab a seat... After about 10 minutes, I went back to the register because our beers still hadn't come out yet... Apparently, the bartender opened them and just left them sitting on the counter instead of bringing them out to us... Okay... After another 30 minutes with no wings, we ended up having to leave because we were on our way to another place... I went back up to the register to get a refund for the wings because we clearly were not going to have time to eat them... None of the employees knew how to do a refund to a credit card... They finally find the guy that knows how to do the refunds, so it gets started... After a couple minutes, I offered to just take cash back because it was my debit card, but they just acted like they didn't hear me... Maybe they didn't... Not only that, when I asked for the refund, no one asked why or even apologized for their shoddy service... They basically acted like I wasn't really standing there until she had me sign the receipt for the refund...  They refunded the money for the beers, too, but I don't think that was an attempt to be courteous, I think they probably couldn't figure it out and didn't care enough to try... That's it... I'm over Carmella's... At least this location...",

I made the mistake of having my arm on the table for more than a few seconds and my skin started fusing to it. This pit obviously hasn't been clean since it was a bellacino's years ago.  Calling what they serve pizza should be a punishable crime.  I've had more appetizing pizza from a box from the grocery store. You'd think a place with Pizza in their name would actually know how to make one.    All I ordered was a couple of slices and fries - all of it was completely inedible.  The food was old and reheated.  F'ing shameful!!! Seriously, you should be f'ing ashamed of yourselves for considering what you serve food.  The food could be considered a lethal weapon if thrown at someone - or, worse yet, force feed someone this manure.  Listen very, very carefully . . . Do not waste your time or money on this place, especially when there are so many better pizza options in the area.  Namely, Portofino's and Luigi's!!!",

I immediately called back to the restaurant to speak a manager, to find out she knew Exactly the order i was speaking of when i called. I explained to her how unhappy i was and that a RAW pizza is unacceptable and could Not feed that to my family! She then proceeded in telling me that they had to put it back in the oven multiple times...\"MULTIPLE TIMES \"...AND ITS STILL NOT COOKED??? SOOOOOOOO... You (manager)knew something was wrong...yet you(Manager) sent it out anyway??? I asked could i get a credit or something being that this was not ok. There was nothing she could do she replied! She said i could bring it back...\"during Rush Hour...on a school night \" it was impossible, i replied!!! Being that i have small Children that needed to eat then get ready for school i could not just run out. Well...that was just it! Even tho...I did my Part and paid a \"Goods for Services\" all i asked for was Cooked Food in return...the Manager was not accommodating at All!!! Being in the Business of Customer Service an unhappy customer to this Magnitude is unacceptable!!! Never EVER..EVER Again...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE ONLY REASON THERE IS A STAR...ITS BECAUSE I HAD TO RATE IT AS SOMETHING...How Unfortunate!",

We had wings- really liked the Thai chili was so tasty- the Caesar and house salad both were good and a large pizza which was excellent. Service was reasonable and the staff was very friendly. The only real problem was that all the food came out at the same time even though I ordered the wings as an appetizer. By the time we ate the wings and salads and tackled the pizza part of it was a little soggy. I would also strongly recommend they invest in some spatulas to serve the 18\" pizzas. It would just be much easier to serve than using the small plastic knife. We'd go back again. I'd just make sure to order the pizza after the wings came out.",
