The chicken fried rice and General Tso's chicken are favorites of mine.  Their lunch specials are cheap and tasty.  Two of my lunch favorites are the egg drop soup and the wonton soup.  Both are very cheap ($1.50 and $1.95, I think) and just down right good.  I've had the Pad Thai here as well.  It's good but a little sweet for me sometimes.  I like my Pad Thai a little spicer, but it's still pretty good.    I give them a solid 4 stars for the entrees that I've had so far!",

The owner, Anna, is very personal and very nice, she can look tired at times but she does not let that affect her. If you want good Chinese food for a fair price you've got to come to Bamboo.

Since it was already after 8 and I was starving, I chose the chicken lo mein.    I was immediately acknowledged when I came in and quickly handed a menu, and give time to choose my order.  While waiting for the lo mein I found the location quaint, smaller than expected yet cozy, too.  Small nice bar in the front and the main dining separated from it by a screen.  Low lighting and cushioned chairs for the tables.  Very relaxing atmosphere with, of course a fish tank.    Then menu includes classic chinese, some vietnamese and japanese selections.  My chicken lo mein was piping hot, very savory and loaded with plenty of meat.  Glad I finally made it there.  I do wish they had a sushi menu and maybe a bit more japanese selections.",

They pay attention to detail and add little touches like cucumber with shrimp sauce on the side when you order crab rangoon. Pad Thai is excellent. Fried rice has flavor. Fried veggie spring rolls are small but are perfectly crispy. Order plenty-you will want more! Crab rangoon is the best I've ever had. Prices may be a little higher than other delivery places, but the food definitely tastes better than most Chinese/Thai takeout. So glad we found this place!",

    "text": "We went as a group to this place. The place was tiny and tight. For the price the quantity of the food was great.  Ambience not so great but the waitress serving the food was good and provided with needed service like brining up the food and also suggesting some good spicy side dishes.   Need improvement in the interiors though it is tiny. Ok let's get back to the food. My order was Vegetable dumplings and General Tso's chicken. The dumpling was not great I had better ones elsewhere. The dumplings layers were little thick they need to be thin. With regards to the chicken no complaints but with the fried rice it was little bit salty. I thought I was the only one tasting too much salt but I confirmed the saltiness with my colleagues too.  Overall great. Also with the name of the place, I don't understand why it was named bamboo 7 I thought only Bamboo could do. Business owner if you could share the story behind it then I would be happy to hear it.",

Rarely have I ever felt genuinely depressed about spending a substantial amount of money on food, but this seriously just brought me down to a new low and left me full of nothing but regret. Were it not for intense military training that left me a hardened and emotionless being, I might have wept after my experience. The food is not of the quality that anyone would expect for the dinner prices. Truly, the only redeeming features were the friendly delivery driver and my dog loved it after my wife dumped her hibachi chicken in its bowl (the same dog also likes to eat dirty socks and used dryer sheets for comparison).  I had General Tso's chicken with fried rice and crab rangoons, my wife had the Hibachi chicken and shrimp. Her Hibachi chicken was just sad, poor quality and dry, no flavor whatsoever. The vegetables that came with it were not hot and seemed barely cooked. My crab rangoons were the worst of any I've had and I always get them at every Asian restaurant. Frankly, I'm just sad and disappointed, not how any meal should leave someone feeling.",

Chose to try this place - we like spicey food so we got the General Tso's, hot and sour soup, and egg roll. Also got the crab Rangoon.  There was no spice at all in the food. Like they ran out of red chili peppers or something. We did not like the soup at all - was thicker than most and again, missing any hint of heat. General Tso's was average. Not good, not bad.. the egg roles were on the soggy side, but tasted fine.  We really craved Chinese and was hoping to get our fix. Not so much.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Bamboo 7 since they opened, and I was so considerably disappointed tonight that I must write this. I ordered take out: 1 egg roll, an appetizer order of the Salt and Pepper Calamari, and Shrimp with Garlic Sauce (sub-Chicken Fried Rice for white/brown rice).   The egg roll was dismal. A tiny offering compared to a normal egg roll and browned almost until burnt; incredibly mushy on the inside. One bite and didn't finish it. I will never order this again. The Salt and Pepper Calamari - which I have enjoyed many times from this restaurant - was horrible. Cooked almost until the coating was rock solid, the calamari had shrunk completely inside the coating. This left me with rock hard coating and small pieces of severely overcooked calamari which I did not want to dig for. Additionally, the portion received was probably 2/3rds of what is usually provided. I tossed most of it, no reason to eat hard coating.  Finally, we get to the Shrimp with Garlic Sauce and Chicken Fried Rice on the side (sub for white or brown rice). What I expect from this restaurant, based on previous experience, is crisp vegetables with a somewhat spicy sauce, and a considerable amount of shrimp cooked just until they are done. What I got was 100% the opposite. A total of eight shrimp in a huge container of vegetables, all of the shrimp had a mushy consistency. The vegetables were soggy and sad, and the sauce had zero taste. I ate a couple of the shrimp, hoping they would get better, but no. Most of this went into the trash.   Chicken Fried Rice....tiny scraps of chicken, no flavor, also ended in the trash.  So.....$24.00 for a meal of which the majority landed in the trash. I'm actually pissed off beyond belief that they would knowingly serve me this take out meal for that price. Never again. :(",

    "text": "I just discovered Bamboo 7 a couple weeks ago and I have literally been here like 5 times since. I'm an Asian food addict and this place is an amazing fix.  From the outside, you might not be too sure. To be honest, I wasn't sure if it was even open when I saw it the first time. I gave it a whirl and the inside was very clean and nice looking I knew it had potential. We've all been to that hole in the wall Chinese place that ended up being terrible but this isn't that place. Bamboo 7 is a gem.  My server is always so friendly and nice and at this point, she knows my order. I get the wonton soup and the pork potstickers. Sort of the same thing but they're my favorites. The wonton soup is so good. The broth has a great flavor and a lot of depth and the wontons are not falling apart in the soup either. The only thing I wish was different about the soup is that it had some veggies in there, but I know that' not the traditional way. The potstickers. DAMN, THEY ARE GOOD. These things are my favorite, I don't think I can come here without getting them. They even come in the authentic basket thing and even though they are steamed, hey are al dente and never slimy.   Someone said this place is the best Chinese in Charlotte - I believe it.",

I also love that they have a few dim sum selections on their menu.

The food was pretty good but not the very best I have had. For a small Asian place in a strip shopping center though, I thought the quality of the food was pretty good.
