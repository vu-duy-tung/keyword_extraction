Definitely not dissapointed with the bang bang shrimp and i ordered the filet with a side lobster tail. Both cooked perfect. Only down side is they forgot the tail so i enjoyed that after i finished the steak, potatoes and sauteed spinach. The waiter was really nice and was energetic. Big reason i always come back, good food, good service and good prices for what you get.",

Their fish selections are always great, and their French toast is the best I've had in the area!  In addition, I love their sangrias... I've actually feel in love with that drink because of this restaurant.  Lol.  The service is good, but you may want to make a reservation for brunch, as they can get busy quickly.  The only downside to the brunch is that I wanted to order it and pick it up, but was told that they no longer allowed \"takeout\" for brunch items because the quality might not be as good when you get it home?  That was too bad, because at times I can't sit and stay but prefer to grab food while I'm out or returning from church.  If they don't allow to-go orders on Sundays (or for certain selections), they force people to go elsewhere for brunch.",

I made my way through the dimly lit place to the bar.  I was greeted with an enthusiastic, \"well, hello there!\" from the bartender.  As I waited for my friend, I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  They were out of the one on the menu; however, the bartender poured me a glass of the wonderful Kim Crawford. My friend had chosen for us to meet there.  She did not realize that I am not consuming seafood at this time, but I am so good at being a vegetarian that I could make a suitable meal at Hardee's if that were the only option.  We both ordered the spinach salad without bacon.  It came with egg and what appeared to be French fried onions, tossed in a warm balsamic vinaigrette.  When the bartender found out that I was vegetarian, he gave me a little bit of grief about it.  Which is not cool, but I, being the professional vegetarian smarty pants that I am, turned his comments into some off color jokes, making those in earshot snicker.  On the bartender's behalf, he was attentive. For my entree, I ordered three vegetables:  potatoes au gratin, steamed asparagus, and steamed broccoli.  Generous portions, and I was even more pleasantly surprised that each was perfectly seasoned!   I didn't love it and didn't hate it.  I typically do not choose chain restaurants, but Bonefish Grill did the best that they could to please yours truly, Ms. Smarty Pants.",

I love eating here with them because they always order Bang Bang Shrimp for an appetizer. Not only is the shrimp yummy but so is the garnish it sits on, it's like a mini salad. The Corn and Crab Chowder is my ultimate favorite. Sometimes I get a bowl as a meal and dip the bread in it, yummy. This time I had the Chilean Sea bass blackened with a side of lemon butter sauce served with mash potatoes and veggies, of course I added the soup also. This was my first time having this expensive fish and it was delicious. I am a salmon fan myself but keep seeing this fish on TV. The wait staff, manager, and bar staff were very professional yet friendly and warm. I felt very welcome to be there and will for sure be back.",

I went to this location (been here lots of times) but this could be the last. I love Bonefish because it is a nice place to have a dinner date and service is always great. I also like that the manager will check on you to make sure all is well. Before I start this, it was a Tuesday night and we were 1 of 4 tables seated. Instead of a long drawn out story, I'll just make a list. 1- ordered unsweet tea  2- had to ask for sweetener 3 times(server asked what color of package did we prefer) 3-1 glass of tea is all we got the whole meal (asked for that 2 times) 4-saw server 2 times (only 3 tables now) he seemed to be standing around talking to the cute girl at the front 5-hostess had a room full of empty tables to seat a family of 6 with 4 very loud children (but decided to seat them right beside us)  6-server even made a rude remark to the family about them having that many children  7-asked to speak to a manger about these issues, but she seemed to make all excuses in the world as to why we haven't seen her or why we could not get anything to drink. I guess #7 is the worst. If the food is bad, the service is bad, the atmosphere is bad, you expect the manager to handle the issue. I will continue to go to the Bonefish, but not this location.",

I ordered a sirloin and crab cake dish with a side of mashed potatoes, but I upgraded the sirloin to a filet cooked medium. That sucker was the rarest steak I have *ever* seen. It was practically still mooing. Everyone at the table was astounded at how undercooked it was. Even the ones who like rare steaks thought it would be too rare for them. At any rate, I sent it back to be cooked. When the steak was returned to me it had been charred on the outside and was still pretty rare on the inside. I hadn't eaten 1/4 of it when I asked for a box. That was honestly the most poorly prepared steak I have ever eaten. It was absolutely terrible. Granted, I don't eat steak often, but it was seriously bad. My boyfriend was very disappointed in his dish as well. He ordered some sort of stir fry and it had been wildly over sauced. I would have only put that much sauce on a dish with twice as many noodles... The point is we had a terrible experience at this bonefish. The food was awful.  Maybe this bonefish recently hired a new chef who just doesn't know how to cook, maybe someone was having an off day, but when we complained we were brushed off. I am terribly disappointed and will not be returning to this location again.",

    "text": "\"I'll have an order of Bang Bang Shrimp with a side of discrimination\". Might as well have said that; both were served in generous portions.  I loathe writing negative reviews. Some yelpers' profiles are filled with 1 & 2 star reviews and one cannot help but wonder if they enjoy slamming businesses. Sure, I've had bad experiences. Most of the time I have no desire to revisit the details in narrative so post no review at all. Other times, I try to find some justification for pushing the review to at least 3 stars. Here was a rare time I struggled to push a review to TWO stars. I waited 48hrs to see if I'd feel different. I don't. I also detest long reviews. You've been warned.  After a rigorous workout, I was enroute home deciding what protein I'd eat & realized I could finally try the Bang Bang shrimp at Bonefish Grill. I'd heard it was $6 on Wed and was less than a mile away. I'd drove pass it for years and always admired the architecture. Upon arrival, the first oddity was the front door. For such a grand facade, the entrance door is single and calls to mind a tiny take-out place. I stood back for a moment, thinking perhaps this wasn't the main entrance, but it was. Hmm.  I walked in and was taken aback. It was shockingly dark. Like 'power outage' dark (minimal lighting).  The interior was in direct contrast with the exterior. The restaurant seems to be in an identity crisis. Attractively modern on the outside, barn-like on the inside.  I looked around to see if there was a better area to be seated, as my body ached and I just wanted to relax. No dice. All equally dismal. Would order to-go.   No one was at the front when I entered. It was 30min past opening and 3 tables were seated.  A young woman arrived within moments, greeted me, and answered questions about choices. 2 separate customers arrived to pick up orders. Each time, the manager came out, handed them the orders, thanked them, smiled & advised them that bread & pesto were in the bag. I was excited; I didn't realize bread & pesto were included in to-go orders. I make pesto at home and LOVE fresh bread. The woman at the counter asked him to help describe the kobe burger to me, which he did with satisfaction then left. I decided on the Bang Bang Shrimp.  I sat for a while in the waiting area, but the gloomy ambiance overwhelmed, so I stood looking out the window in meditative calm. I was bundled up, since it was chilly outside and my pores were still open from the routine. I heard a voice behind me say \"here's your order\", and smiling, I turned around, only to see her abruptly pause, pull the order slightly back & ask in a distinctly accusing tone \"did you pay already?\". (WHAT? Wait...WHAT? Ok...I'm sorry...WHAT?) The look in her eyes, her body language, just horrible.  Here I was, in this antebellum-like establishment, and despite the previous 2 pick-ups being hand delivered their orders personally by the manager directly from the kitchen, NEITHER WERE ASKED IF THEY'D ALREADY PAID. (The first put you in the mind of Joe Biden, the second, Jennifer Aniston.) They had both also ordered Bang Bang shrimp. It is a small reception area. The attendants who rang me up were right there! Zero excuse. Were I an indignant snob, I'd responded that 'yes, I paid with a card you may never qualify for'. But I am not. I stood incredulously.  It didn't end there.  No bread or pesto.  Nauseated with disgust but civil, I mentioned to the young woman I'd first spoke with and another young man who'd just shown up that I observed the last 2 pickups receiving fresh bread & pesto in their orders, and questioned why mine lacked. I imagined -hell, I HOPED- they would say it was because those orders were for more than 2 entrees or something, which would have been acceptable. (Still trying to put a positive spin on things. Still giving benefit of doubt.) They looked at each other, shrugged, and said they didn't know, saying it should have been included. I was done at that point. DONE.  You would think the manager himself would then have brought the missing items out, offering up some corporate style regret right? Nothing. No damage control or conciliatory effort from management. The young man brought the items and apologized.  The delivered missing items didn't erase the stain of the experience.   The shrimp was glorious; the portion was huge. The bread tasted fresh baked. The pesto wasn't pesto; it was oil with a pitch of pesto in it.   Business is a team effort. It pains me when those who put forth A+ effort suffer due to the recklessness of teammates. Why should the cooks not be celebrated? That bigoted young woman is a liability; those cooks are an asset. Only reason ANY stars were justified is them. Shame. Won't return.",

    "text": "Well...I can say that if you sit at the bar you are definitely greeted like long lost friends!  That was very nice.  Lee, Rafi and another girl were very friendly and helpful and made sure we had what we needed throughout.  We ordered the Pecan Trout and Grilled Tilapia.  My sweetie is trying to eat healthy, but I don't think he was satisfied with the Tilapia...not their fault though...it was very good, just more plain than I think he wanted.  The portion for that was a bit small...it looked as if 1/3 of it didn't make it onto the plate.  The Pecan Trout was huge and delicious.  Very well cooked and flavorful.  I ordered the rice with it not realizing it came with couscous.  I wish I had a double portion of the couscous or maybe tried another veggie...the rice wasn't that great.  Decent pricing and a good selection of drinks & beer.",

    "text": "Because I'm a vegetarian, this review should be taken with a grain of salt. I found the service to be good, the ambience nice and the food consistent.   The BANG BANG SHRIMP, of course, was a hit for most of the table. It was spicy, nicely fried and came with a decent portion size.   The free bread and herb oil was also very nice. The bread was soft inside and perfectly toasted outside, while the oil had enough flavor from the herbs to not be bland.   My TOMATO SOUP was nothing special. And the CAESAR SALAD was equally boring.   My husband's STEAK was perfectly cooked. He ordered two healthy veggie sides, and his overall meal was exactly what he was looking for. He travels for work and eats at high end steak houses all over the US, but he said this steak quality and cooking was on par with the best he's had.   The LOBSTER GRILLED CHEESE sandwich was enjoyed by another person in my group. I thought it appeared dry, but she liked it and said it had good lobster flavor.   The desserts were the most disappointing portion of the meal. The COCONUT PIE was recommended by the server. Beware that it is a warm cooked coconut pie with a thick layer of shredded coconut on top. The coconut was too thick to be nicely browned and toasted, so it ended up being hard to eat.   The KEY LIME PIE was the best of the three. It was tart and thick and creamy. But the crust was soggy - missed potential.   And the MACADAMIA NUT BROWNIE WITH ICE CREAM could not have been more generic. It was fine for a sweet bite to end the meal, but again, nothing special.   I find this place to be perfectly adequate, but not somewhere I'd crave or really want to return.",

The servers are kind, knowledgeable, helpful and well trained. At the other location, they act as though they are doing you a favor by waiting on you. The only disappointment was the strawberry shortcake. The biscuits were served cold, hard and stale. Didn't eat them---and for a nearly $8 dessert---it should have been great. The server did not ask how it was. Don't waste your money on it unless you find out first if the biscuits are freshly made or stale.",

Gena our lovely waitress gave my dining companion and me some recommendations for lighter versions of our favorite appetizers and entrees. These were simple modifications to menu items that made our dinners lighter in all the high calorie sauces and butter but so very flavorful that we didn't feel like we had sacrificed anything! I'd never gave known these options were available without Gena's input. Wonder why Bonefish doesn't  offer these lighter fare options on their regular menu? I'm certainly going to request these from now on when I dine here. Thanks,Gena, for being so informative and knowledgeable as well as friendly and efficient!",

So for this review, I'll just highlight some of my favorites:  Cerviche Appetizer- It's light, crisp and refreshing. I love the combination of flavors and especially the fresh avocado. I definitely recommend starting off with this dish!   Pomegranate Martini- It's my absolute favorite martini here. It's a combination of vodka, pomegranate and mango. It's sweet while not overwhelming and comes with three frozen grapes. Perfect!   Bang Bang Shrimp- Classic.Fried.Spicy...$5 on Wednesday!   Creme Brulee- Whoa...Oh my creamy goodness. It's ridiculous. (Warning: You may want to lick the bowl!)  Side Note: Our waiter Tim was AMAZING. He totally rocked it out with the service! But I would be remiss not to mention... that he's freaking hilarious!!! He had us laughing all night! Make sure you ask to sit in his section!   This place is definitely worth a visit!",

The only reason we want to write this review is to make sure the manager that night, Julie, gets credit for being amazing. About a week ago we went to Bonefish and unfortunately the service was not up to par at all. I told my fiancee we were sitting at the invisible table. We didn't ask for a manager because we know every night is not perfect. The waitress must have known that we were not happy with our service and our food. We didn't ask for a manager but the waitress sent the manager our way. I have had poor service at other restaurants and the manager may come over say I'm sorry and discount your food and go about their way. Julie had exceeded our expectations. She was so friendly and apologetic and she was so concerned with how we were treated and wanted to make sure we received the service that we always come to expect. It was like we were talking to a good friend. Kudos to you!",

For a chain their food is,especially the fish dishes, is well prepared and spot on every time. This trip I just had the fish and chips but it was some of the best I've ever had. Not too much breading, too oily or to over/under cooked. For appetizers we had some calamari and a stuffed dumpling with ginger sauce that was both prepared and presented at top notch standards. The little bread basket they brought out was even out of this world. Bread was super fresh and not stale or tough. Anyways, this is a spot you should for sure check out when you get a chance.",

Great date spot( I have already told honey that this is where I want to come for Valentines), nice low mood lighting and nice music playing(not too fast, not too slow, just enough to make you tap your foot).  Go on Wednesdays, Bang Bang shrimp-which is one of their signature dishes- $5!  We also had the crabcake appetizer.  Extremely yummy!  The crab cakes(2) were good size, very meaty with very little bread, and a nice remoulaude that really set the dish off.  The Bang Bang shrimp were very lightly breaded and sweet and spicy.  The portions are great for the appetizers and the meal.  Doing it over again we would only order one appetizer because we were almost too full for our main dish after having 2( and we are not bird eaters lol). Everything about our entree was perfect, fresh, and seasoned perfectly.  And then I had the chocolate creme brulee....LAWD!!!!  So good.  I considered driving back tonight and going to get another.  If you like chocolate this is sin on a spoon. My eyes were rolling in the back of my head.  To summarize...LOVED IT.  Not too pricey in my opinon, you'd pay the same as eating at redlobster- but get food that is alot less fresh.",

The second time we came with a purpose which was to see if their Waygu Beef burger was as good as a competitors . The manager had met us at the door and the conversation just lead to the reason for our visit which, of course, he stated that, \"Our's is the best hands down\" which I replied, \"That will be up to us to decide\". What a set-up. We both ordered ours well done with no pink and no bacon. What came to the table was  all but dripping with pink to red juices and two slabs of bacon on them. We were appalled. The waiter quickly came and removed our plates and after what seemed to be 30 minutes we received new food on new plates cooked to our original preferences. All's well that ends well. We will come back again with high hopes that they will do better. Still, they are still good enough to receive 4 stars as one incident doesn't deserve to take away from the overall. They are still a real classy place with great food and service. When they get it right.  ;-)",

The issue- my husband, who normally has an iron stomach, woke up in the middle of the night with severe GI issues, which have persisted through the day. Bonefish was the only thing he ate that day. Not sure of the offending agent between Bang Bang Shrimp and Lilly's chicken with spinach, but will not return due to food safety issues.",

He provided great suggestions on what to try (as I haven't been there in a while) and was so friendly and engaging.  I ordered the stuffed lobster w/asparagus and mashed potatoes with a glass of red wine.  Upon leaving, I introduced myself to Phillip, mgr. to express the warm front-of-the-house reception.  He was so receptive to my compliments and I offered to write this review of my dining experience.  It was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while in Charlotte!  I'm a major foodie and always looking for an elegant dining experience out. It was a clean, inviting environment, professional and friendly/engaging staff and the food was wonderful!  Keep up the good work and thanks for a wonderful dining experience. I'll definitely be back and bring friends. Ray Clark",

Bang bang had almost no sauce and was chewy rather than crispy. I had been hungry for this specific item....that's why I went. To make things worse, the ahi tuna sashimi was almost cooked THROUGH!   The bar tending staff fixed my drink, but they stopped talking to me after that, and I was kind about it. The icing on the cake was the elderly lady slurring her words (loudly) to someone at the bar.  I know they've had some changes in management here, but the food quality hadn't noticeably changed until now.... I guess I should change the location I go to. So sad because this was one of my favorites close to home.",

    "text": "I came here with a fellow yelper as she (Grace L.) told me that it was worth it. And surprisingly, she couldn't believe that I haven't came before. This place is located right next to the Guitar Center, right on Independence Blvd.   Anyways, lets get to the exciting part: the food. As I just ate at 2:00 and then came here at 5, I was thinking I wasn't going to eat that much. But seeing the menu I had to try out their Kobe Beef burger. Grace's hubby decided to just get appetizers so I had my fair share of their different types of appetizers.  We ordered the restaurant favorite: Bang Bang Shrimp, Crab Cakes, and the fried Calamari. Lets go through them.  Bang Bang Shrimp: Not bad. This I thought was actually the worse appetizer compared to the other 2. The problem of this appetizer was that there was just no flavor to it. It was just fried shrimp, with some kind of sauce and had a hint of spice to it. Almost like they sprinkled it with black pepper and that was it. The sauce, was just bland. Plain and simple. My friend told me that it was usually better than this time, but I guess I'll just have to find out next time.  Crab Cakes: I thought these were delicious. Even though crab cakes are usually pricey and usually no one gets them I thought they were very full and had a good amount of crab in them. The flavor I thought was better than the shrimp. It came with a sauce that went pretty well with it.  Fried Calimari: Not bad. Well, calimari was calimari, nothing crazy special. It came with an Asian sweet dipping sauce, sort of like a sweet and sour sauce, and that was about it. All fried calimari preparations taste the same this way, the only place that I like the calimari prepared is the one they make at Saigon Palace on South Blvd.  Kobe Beef Burger: I sort of killed this dish, just because I thought it was the dish of the night for me. It was big and full of flavor. The beef had a sort of sweetness to it and was very tender when I bit into it. So, yes. I recommend to try this dish. (And I know, it's a fish grill and I didn't order fish...but that means I have something to try next time!)  So. Why 3 stars? The price I felt didn't justify the means. I think they're going for a sort of high/medium class of food and service. But the location and menu just didnt seem like it. It's part of a department store, not an independent kind of store. The service wasn't bad and I thought if I give a 3, I have a chance to come back to it and give it another go at it.",

    "text": "I've been going to this Bonefish for years. Always excellent until yesterday. We went for drinks and appetizers. We sat at the bar as usual and started with drinks. My wife ordered a house wine that was $6.50 , when I got the bill it was $11.80 so I questioned it ? The bartender said oh ! I told her she should have informed us of the steep price difference and most nice places would have informed us or usually charged the house price. She went to the manager and after 15 minutes she came back and adjusted the bill. I was happy till I looked at the new check and he had GENEROUSLY ! gave us a FREE ice tea . Then the appetizers , OMG . We ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp  as usual , they were very small and tough , but we choked them down. Also the pot stickers , ice cold inside and slimy , told her to take them off the bill. Terrible Manager , Terrible Service , Terrible food , asked to speak with the manager and he never came !!! And they weren't busy !! It's been over a week and no reply ? Guess they don't care",

We are regular customers of this location but unfortunately have seen them overwhelmed on major holidays before . Bonefish will no longer be our choice for important occasions as they obviously cannot handle them and overbooked without caring about their customers.",

The steak was cooked to medium perfection and the lobster tail was moist and fresh.. I don't wanna get started on all the bread I ate with that oil dip it was amazing! My honey said his T-bone was the best he ever had and his shrimp were delicious as well. I wasn't to thrilled with my side salad and the bang bang shrimp was luke warm. Our server Michael was awesome..he made my bday dinner so much better! Great attitude, great service and never stayed gone too long but he wasn't hovering over us either! I will definitely be back to sit in his section and try the bang bang shrimp again because I heard it was amazing!",

Also, I felt the side portions that accompanied my fish were too small. I had to order an additional side of rice. Luckily, the rice was delivered quickly, so I didn't miss a beat. My husband had the fish and chips which he enjoyed.  The best part of the meal was the dessert. The key lime pie was delicious! Also, my husband ordered soda, but there was something wrong with the soda machine that night. The first soda was too clear, the next one was dark, but flat. He sent them both back. The service was great as well as the ambiance. Will return and order different items.",

    "text": "My fiance and I went here last night because we got a gift card from my mom. We decided to get a to go order. We placed our order and it was ready within 15-20 minutes. Not too bad of a wait. I order the bang bang shrimp tacos and paid $4 extra for steamed asparagus instead of fries. My fiance ordered the dynamite shrimp with fries and coleslaw. When we got our order, we immediately went to the car and checked for accuracy. Well, they forgot to put the fries and coleslaw in the bag so my fiance had to go back inside and get his sides. This took about 5 minutes. Again, not a big deal. However, I decided to try the asparagus in the car because I wanted to try it while it was \"fresh\" and \"hot\". Well when I opened the container, I was disappointed because it seemed like a very small portion considering I had to pay $4 extra AND the asparagus was not even hot nor did it have any flavor. My fiance tried his fries on the way home from the restaurant and his fries were also cold and subpar flavor wise. We weren't expecting much else from the food due to the underwhelming sides but we were both impressed with our main dishes. The bang bang shrimp was amazing, though the tortillas tasted like store bought tortillas. And the dynamite shrimp tasted alright as well. The coleslaw tasted spoiled so we didn't even eat half of that. Overall, it was not worth what we paid ($42.00) and we probably won't be back. Atmosphere seemed nice in the restaurant but the food was not premier quality.",

The other food - appetizers, main dishes, sides, desserts, drinks, even the bread are all very good.  The restaurant itself seems too small for all the tables they have in it. When it's full, people are bumping into each other at tables, the wait staff have to be careful to not have plates knocked out of their hands squeezing through the people/tables. It's just too cramped to really enjoy your visit. Week nights seem to be a little better but the holidays are awful! It is always absolutely packed.  The wait staff is always nice. On our recent visit we had a very kind waitress but she was so flakey. We had to ask for the same items over and over and she forgot to mention some of the sides they had (not listed on the menu). I'm not sure if she was overworked with all her tables or if she's naturally flaky & forgetful. Anyway, I recommend going on a weekday maybe for lunch or a random day not close to any holidays.",

The Bang Bang shrimp is a staple (both the app and the tacos).  I always go for the Chilean Sea Bass which is always on point.  I've gone with many that have opted for steak and I would agree, after they let me sample, it's well cooked and a nice cut or meat (bone-in ribeye).  The sides are a little bland.  I had the spinach and green beans.  I'm not a fan of the extra sauces and salt most restaurants out on their food so I am completely fine with the \"rawness\" of the sides.  They have some \"premium\" side options for about $4 more when paired with an entree; I think that is a little pricey for sides paired with an entree.  I'm never disappointed with Bonefish and will go back time and time and time again.",

I don't know if it's because we were there around 8pm when they're about to close or was it something else.  But, we got sick afterwards due to their undercook seafoods.  So, if you have children, don't bring them here to eat because they could get sick.  Beware for yourself as well.  I expected more from this higher brand from the chain.",

The kitchen can be slow but JAY delivers on expeditious, courteous and appropriate service.   I don't love the chowder due the corn and the base but the burgers made folks in my dining party excited.  Tried the 3 course with the 6oz sirloin @ 160degrees with augratin and fries. The fries have a little batter to them and crisp. The Au gratin was served with bread crumbs (which I personally never care for) yet the crumbs didn't distract. They kind of helped. Tasty and creamy. Dessert was as close to beignets as I've had in this town and I'd highly recommend. They are served two (2) to a plate with chocolate sauce and caramel sea salt. I'd prefer a cherry or raspberry but my word so flaky, so decadent, so PERFECT rolled in sugar (which I don't have to have).   The dumplings impressed the dining crowd as a burst of flavor. I'll try something else next time but I prefer Bang Bang shrimp without the sauce. Yeah! I said it.   Happy HOur still in effect. Give it a try. Ask for Jay.",

    "text": "We had come here because we had heard so much about it. We came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We were asked by the hostess if we had reservations and we said no, so she told us we would wait about 10 minutes (note to self, make reservations next time). There was standing-room only in the waiting area. About 25 minutes passes and our name is finally called.   We were pleased to see a wide selection of fish on the menu -- a very good variety and portion sizes. Prices are not on the cheap side (moderate) which would explain why the restaurant was so crowded. Food was good and service was mostly prompt. There was a time during our stay that our server seemed to forget about things we had asked for and waited for his return. The impression we had was that they were either short-handed that night or our server had too many tables, because we had to wait for him on a couple of occasions for a request we made.  We ended up having coffee and dessert too, which was excellent. Coffee was fresh and very good (a rarity for both in most any restaurant!).  One thing we noticed was how the servers were always courteous to patrons to let them seat first before walking by them, or they would give \"right-away\" to other servers bearing a load of dishes. Wow -- manners still exist in this day and age!  Overall it was a good experience, though I rate the general experience of food+service+timing as a 3.5.   I would definitely repeat again with reservations, or try lunch instead to see how the experience compares.",

However, I think the managers/owners should know just how good this team was.  As you can tell by my opening statement, I am already a fan of Bonefish.  I ordered two of my favorites, the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer, and the sesame-encrusted seared tuna  (in the appetizer section, but a large portion is offered, and this is commonly my meal).  The shrimp was spectacular as always.  However, when the tuna arrived (my coworker ordered the same thing because I recommend it) it was not seared. It was cooked through.  Not my favorite thing, but clearly edible.  My dinner-mate was disappointed too, and so I asked the server if they could have another version done. I hated to be a pain, but still...I like it seared - not cooked!  She was polite, and tried to help, but they were out. It wasn't the end of the world, but it wasn't the best we have had either.  Well, after the check came, the server had mentioned to the manager. She comped both Tuna entrees, which was very nice, and again it was edible, so we all made out okay. I'll for sure go back and order the same meal again. I know it will be just great.",

Not too spicy, just the perfect blend of heat and great meaty shrimp.  Can't beat it.    My favorite entree here (as hard as it is to really pick one) has to be the Ahi Tuna \"Tokyo Style\".  Rare, seared tuna served with Asian vegetables and Jasmine Rice.  It's a colorful dish and equally as tasteful.  Highly recommended!  This \"fishy\" likes Bonefish and it just feels like home!",

We had a 40 minute wait, but with a couple of beers at the bar, it passed quickly. Their draft selection of beers seems limited, with only 4 being available.   Jessie, our waitress, took great care of us and service was fast. They were running a non-RW affiliated special, four courses (appetizer, salad, entree, dessert) for $30. We chose to go this route, even though the famous Bang Bang Shrimp wasn't listed as an available appetizer. (Jessie told us it was on special on Wednesdays for $5 so we might come back then to try it.)  The food was very, very good. We loved the Wagyu Beef wontons. The Cesar salad was tasty, but a little too ice cold for my liking - it was hard to get any real flavor from it. I ordered the special filet, and my husband ordered the Ahi tuna, which arrived perfectly seared and rare on the inside.   Based on our great experience, we will definitely return.",

The place is a little dressier than the other venues in its immediate area, but it isn't too stuffy. It's relaxed in that particularly upper-middle-class way: I'm surprised that they're located on 74 instead of somewhere in Ballantyne.  Anyways, I digress from the main point of this review: the food is good. Really good.  Make sure you order the much-lauded Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer: it really is as delicious as everyone says, and it's half off on Wednesdays too boot.  For my main course, I ordered grilled shrimp and scallops with mango salsa.  The scallops were good, but the shrimp were definitely some of the best I've ever had in my entire life, and I have had a lot of shrimp.  They were little meaty flavor bombs.  I don't know if they're always that good, but I certainly will go back to find out.  Bonefish is worth driving on 74 to get there. I think that's the best praise I can give.",

The prices are a little more expensive but its totally worth it.",

I told her to take away this order and bring me an appetizer of bang bang shrimp, which was good, that I had for my dinner.  There is absolutely NO value for your money at this restaurant and I was so surprised that people in this town like to pay for so little food at such a HUGE price.

This particular restaurant is not too big in size compared to others but the ambiance is mixed in feelings depending on if you're sitting on the bar size or the restaurant size. The first time I went here, I was with a few friends so we sat in the booth on the bar side. I went with my family the next time and we sat at a table on the restaurant side which was a little quieter.   The Fresh Apple Martini is very good (Pomegranate Martini was so so).   Appetizers that you must try include Singapore Calamari and the Bang Bang Shrimp (the Mussel Josephine was okay, not great). You can also get the Bang Bang Shrimp Taco as a meal.   My favorite dish here that I always order is the Scallop and Shrimp served with Jasmine rice and some vegetable. As for the sauce, I like the Warm Mango Salsa but you can ask them to bring you other sauce to try such as the Pan Asian or the Chimichurri sauce. The one dish that I do not recommend is the Pad Thai.",

    "text": "This is the second Bonefish Grill I've been to in a few years. The other one was up north.  My overall experience was so-so but the food was pretty good. We went on Mother's Day. I believe someone in our group made reservations so there was no wait.  Here's how it went down from beginning to end.  1. We were seated at an \"extended table\" in an awkward location. Right near the front door and the \"extension\" seemed to be a small table that was shorter than the main table and tilted towards the floor the slightest bit so we had to be careful NOT to put anything near the join. Which was hard to remember because the whole shebang was covered with the same piece of butcher's paper (?).  2. Our drink order was taken. Drinks received soon enough but someone in our group had to ask for bread.  3. Food order taken. I applaud the staff for getting everyone's food out almost simultaneously. We were a party of nine or 10.  4. Wait staff was very attentive but forgot the side sauces some asked for.  5. Leftovers were boxed to go upon request but returned to the diners (me included) without a bag. Initially I thought they didn't HAVE bags. Then I noticed other diners exiting with bags so I asked and received.  (It just makes sense to me that a customer leaving one's establishment with... anything would be given that item in a BAG. A bag displaying one's establishment name or logo is also a means of free advertisement as I will re-use a good bag until it falls to shreds.)  6. The waiter knew to ask if  and how the bill should be split.  Peeve: The way their prices are displayed on the menu.   By the way, my meal was delicious. I wasn't in the mood for seafood so I ordered Lily's Chicken. It was delicious.",

Grilled scallops and shrimp - what was it, only 4 of each?- plump meat, nice and firm not overcooked by much but way too charred. I like charcoal but here it overpowered the seafood. A pity really. The mango sauce, what can I say I don't know what they were going for and I suspect neither did the cook. Don't remember the side veggies.  Meh, definitely meh.

It isn't breaded and grilled and soaked in butter (ahem...like the 'grilled' shrimp and scallops at.Carrabas!  grrrr!!)  But it is just great fish plainly grilled.  I love that.  They offer a choice of sauce - for those that need sauce.  The Chimichurri sauce is my favorite - simple and not overpowering  - mostly just parsely.  The grilled entrees come with a choice of a side - I love the scalloped potatoes.  It is a ton of food so prepare yourself to take some home!    The atmosphere is cozy for a chain, low lighting with booths and tables.  A little more upscale than you would think.    The Bang Bang Shrimp is a fantastic app, there is a bit of spice to it which I LOVE!!  I think Wednesdays they have a special on this app?  It is definitely enough shrimp to be an entire meal.  Huge shrimp, perfectly seasoned on a bed of lettuce.  Yum!",

Bonefish Grill in Matthews is spot-on every time I visit.  I have become a slight regular at Bonefish, seeing as how I work in the area. The ingredients have always been fresh and top-quality. Freshness only goes so far, though; it requires refined technique to bring out the flavors. Kitchen manager Sandra and her team do an excellent job preparing each dish to perfection. Table service is also stellar, with an attentive and knowledgable wait staff that is eager to help.   While not the cheapest eats in town, you do get what you pay for: incredible food and great service. The only thing better would be more room (so I don't have to wait for a table).",
