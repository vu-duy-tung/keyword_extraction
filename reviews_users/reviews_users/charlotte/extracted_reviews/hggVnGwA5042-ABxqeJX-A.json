    "text": "Many of my area foodie-cronies oft-hail Good Food as \"the best restaurant in Charlotte\". Though it's located but a stone's throw from my office, I had never taken the opportunity to dine there. Perhaps because of the heavy, universal praise it receives I had relegated it to some mythic status worthy only of an extremely special occasion. Through the birthday wishes of my esteemed friend Katherine, however, my hand was forced, and on a breezy Tuesday evening in October I finally cracked Good Food's threshold.   We had on this night a crew of seven, which pushes the limits of Good Food's per-table capacity - but though they take no reservations, they easily and quickly accommodated our party (just by glancing through the restaurant's open front glass as I walked up past the posh little stuffed-sofa lounging area on the patio out front, I had taken note of the bustling little bar and seemingly cramped dining space and pessimistically doomed-and-gloomed us to not getting a table any time soon - way to prove me wrong, Good Food!). We were seated in the back near rear the rear exit and greeted promptly by our server...  If I may break from my review narrative for a moment and go on a not-colorful tangent: Our waitress was extraordinarily pregnant. I'm not sure why I found this so troubling, but it vexed me greatly. While I completely understand an expectant mother's need and desire to continue working and earning money while gestating a child, that somehow doesn't gel well with a dining experience. In my mind, very-pregnant women should not be on their feet serving me food and drinks. It's odd. It makes me feel like a jerk. I wanted so badly to offer her my chair and maybe even go so far as to extend to her the courtesy of foot massage. Yet, circumstantially, most would argue that that would have been an odd thing to do. I felt like I was in a weird social trap with no chivalrous outlet. So, ultimately, I just sat up really straight and tried not to curse too much.   Back to the review: Good Food's dining area is nothing short of \"adorable\" - the quotes are for implying a sort of quaint/artsy/charming/small aspect to that adorability. It is dim and loud, with various eras of exposed brick lending their geometry to the perimeter, browns and yellows and old bronze colors filling the whole of the palette, and ornate crossworks of fused forks and spoons and knives creating the lightshades and wall-art. There's nothing exceptional about the decorations of the space itself, but it all coalesces into being very successful at establishing what it means to.   Drinks here trend toward wine and fancy cocktails, not surprisingly, but there are a handful of well-selected local beers available as well. I tried the elderflower martini - it burned soft and was cleverly earthy, but somehow felt unbalanced. On subsequent rounds I just ordered NoDa brewing's Hop Drop n Roll. The beer felt uncouth for the situation, but it's what I wanted.    Katherine, being the expert on Good Food's multi-round-small-plates ordering methodology, got us started with some pomme frites, a couple hot little dishes of steamed broccoli and battered cheddar, and a rather fancy cheese plate. All served quickly, all tasty, and all presented cleanly without pretense - I appreciate a subtle plating. Yet, I was not quite impressed.  For a \"main course\", my ladyfriend and I went splitsies on the seared scallops and a daily special of grouper served atop mixed veggies. Others at our table opted for the gnocchi or the garganelli pasta - which we all bandied about and sampled from incautiously, which seems to be the way of Good Food. Again, each dish was perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned, and promptly served... but I was still not quite impressed.   Katherine, now five martinis in and guffawing heartily at AJ's even silliest quips, was ready for more and so we commenced desserts. We all shared spoonsful of a decadent chocolate-and-peanut butter brownie cake type thing as well as a so-sweet-it-hurt strawberry cheesecake. With these I was nearly impressed - but I'm hardpressed to qualify desserts as a reason to elevate a restaurant's food-status.   After paying our three-hundred-dollar tab, we left feeling happy, not too full, and a little bit buzzed. Which I supposed is a very grown-up alternative to the stuffed-and-wasted condition through which my friends and I usually stumble our way out of a restaurant.   In the end my assessment is that while good, Good Food is not great. There are a dozen restaurants in Charlotte that, in my mind, are just as tasty for half the price and twice the fun. But I also accept that perhaps, gluttonous and ravenous that I am, I might not be Good Food's ideal patron. If you're sophisticated, overpaid, and perpetually on a diet... this is probably the best restaurant in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Go early or prepare to wait.  Go to Good Food when you are feeling patient.  If you do have to wait, walk across the street and get a drink at Park Lanes bowling alley/bar - Good Food will text you when your table is ready. The food is so good, if you aren't a patient person - try the restaurant on a Mon-Wed night.  Small space - Don't arrive with a big group - this a restaurant for smaller parties.  Also, don't expect this to be a quiet romantic meal - the restaurant is small and the table next to you is so close it's almost like they are part of your table.    Tapas style food - Depending on how much you want to eat this could be good or bad - for me the portions are perfect, for my 6\"5 boyfriend not so much .  For a more hearty dish order the Garganelli pasta which is very filling.  If you want something a little ethnic tasting, order the Paparadelle with spiced lamb cheeks which is a little sweet, a little spicy so watch out for the kick.    If you are prepared for the things above, you will no doubt be blown away by the food.  Everyone mentions the steamed bun, which is no doubt delicious and flavorful.  If you try one and split it, you will likely want to order a second so just go ahead and order two.  I've ordered the scallops here several times and they are always cooked to perfection.  The cheese plate was delicious, salmon was good and bigger than I expected but not my favorite item on the menu.  The corn risotto is the only thing I've had that was just ok - I would pass on this and leave room for more of the really, really good foods.  The gnocchi and the pomme frites (with some truffle oil) were very tasty.

    "text": "Seeing as this is the only sit-down restaurant meal I've eaten in Charlotte, my review may be a bit skewed, but I didn't think this was the most OMG-amazing-I-can-die-happy-now meal of my life. My dining companion, who is much better versed in the local eats than I, assured me that this was the best meal he's ever consumed in the city. Despite this praise and his expertise, I found myself smiling and nodding so I didn't insult his home town by saying that it was good, but *just* good. Had the restaurant been named \"Good food and not very good cocktails on Montford\" I may have given it five stars for perfectly fulfilling its name, but instead I read the name as \"The Best Food in Charlotte, Let Alone on Montford.\" Oops.  Since I've already stopped being polite, I'll go ahead and begin with those very cocktails. At this point in the evening, having spent nearly three hours waiting in line to see the McAdenville Christmas lights, I was damn near delirious from lack of food and being imprisoned in a car. I was a little wary of how sour the Montford Gin Sour (meyer lemon house sour, Plymouth Gin, St. Germain, egg white) would be, wanting something more akin to \"comfort drinks,\" so I went with the Mayflower (Plymouth Gin, agave nectar, basil, lime juice) which seemed like a safe bet. Though it was quite strong, it really lacked flavor from any of the elements other than the gin. How can you mess up \"safe\"? The Sour ended up not being terribly sour but did lack the body that the egg white should have developed in the drink. I can't speak to the quality of Justin's Good Old Fashioned, but he assured me it followed the trend of strong drinks and was well pieced together. The chocolate-chili dessert cocktail, the Hot Chocolate Martini, was the best composed of the four for the evening and I was a bit bummed I couldn't have more since I pulled the short straw and was driving back. Good Food's cocktail program may not be as sophisticated as I prefer, but it did one thing right: it easily got my boyfriend drunk. That's saying a lot for an Irishman who can hold his liquor, so ladies, take note...and take advantage.  We ordered the cheese plate to whet our palates while we browsed the rest of the menu, picking out more than enough to satisfy our hunger. The three cheeses were well paired with with honey/fennel, jam and truffle chutney, and overall was my second favorite part of the meal. My number one dish was the parmesan gnocchi with roasted chicken, mushrooms and arugula with porcini broth (which is a huge compliment as I generally do not like mushrooms), and I really enjoyed the green curry mussels. Justin liked the crispy Korean beef, the steamed bun was good, and the let down of the night was the scallops with grits.  As the reality of the amount of not-so-small plates we ordered was setting in...into our waistlines, we were offered the dessert menu. Never one to turn it down, we gave it a glance and I ordered the malt flavored cheesecake and Justin got the aforementioned dessert cocktail. At this point in the evening, we were the only diners remaining yet the girls helping us were still very helpful. The cheesecake had the consistency and taste of a slightly-malted flavored flan -- not your typical cheesecake but quite beautiful. It was garnished with crushed malt candies, i.e., Whoppers, which made it that much better since they remind me of my childhood.",

    "text": "The reviews here sound so good so I expect nothing less.  It met my expectations but I saw some items in the pics here on Yelp that aren't on the menu anymore (kind of a bummer).  Here are my dishes:  Sauted mushroom.... My fav of the meal.... cooking was done in super high heat to yield a nice seared exterior on each piece of mushroom.  Very hard to do at home and they did it well.  Scallop -   Not crazy about the complements (cheesy grits and a cooked Endive that tasted blah).  The scallop was fine.    Arugula Salad - didn't taste too special but hey, it's a salad.  Thumbs up for lots of pecans and chucks of goat cheese and a big bed of leaves.  Lamb Cheek tagine - this was a new item on the menu and I'm not too crazy about it.  tasted like a tomato based stew without  a lot of lamb flavor.  the meat is shredded and portion size pretty small given it's mounted on a bed of coucous inside a mini-tagine.  House Bread -  bread was cold.  Hate restaurants that don't bother to warm up the bread.   It comes with balsmic in olive oil.     Service - you have to flag down the staff to order more stuff but it was the right level of service without being too intrusive.  water was refilled several times without prompt... thumbs up.  Got there on a Tue night around 6:30 pm and the place was almost packed.  Wow, such a busy place.  People tend to sit for a long time at their tables so get there early or late if you don't want to wait.",

The first course-cheese came and was awesome. The second up was to be soup but pasta came next instead-no problem. But then as we were enjoying excellent pasta the soup came and was quickly followed by a steamed bun. We advised to slow down-we had too much too fast and things were going to get cold. We were told \"the kitchen sends things when they are ready\". 30 seconds later our fish course came too. Of the 5 items we ordered 4 of them, all the hot ones sitting on our small table at once. NOT HAPPY. We ate quickly to not have to eat cold soup or cold fish but after felt like we were in a hot dog eating contest. We did not get to enjoy 4 out of 5 items we ordered.  That being said, from what I recall actually tasting the food was good but the experience was awful. Past visits here were on weeknights when I was calling this my favorite restaurant, so I caution anyone coming here on a weekend as the focus is obviously on turning tables and NOT guest experience.

    "text": "A restaurant that truly lives up to its name:  Good Food, and one of the best dining experiences you can have in Crown Town at this time.  The space is a simple building that was converted from an old dentist's office, with the kitchen closed off in the back and a small, but very intimate feeling space inside that doesn't leave the host with more than a coffee table to take names upon.  Still, there is a mix of seating at both a bar, high top tables, and a long bench row of seats with regular tables to match.  You'll feel closer to your fellow dinners, but it adds to the ambiance.  The lighting is just a bit dark and there are nice accents, like the fork and spoon light fixtures that hang above the bar.  Speaking of which, any meal here should begin with a look over the small, yet thoughtful cocktail menu.  There is an obvious emphasis on using seasonal ingredients (which extends to the food menu) and creating unique flavors not found else where.  The wine list is also noteworthy here, not for its length, but for the depth of flavor profiles covered by the selections.  The wine by the glass selections are numerous, but don't miss the bottle section for even broader choices.  The menu itself is a single page broken down into different courses, though everything is served as tapas style portions.  This encourages you to sample around the menu to craft a full meal and you'll be well-served to do so.  There are some mainstays on the menu, but other selections will rotate with the seasonal produce available.  Pick and choose as your taste buds tempt, as this kitchen has obvious skill across multiple different cuisines.  Couple regular options you should give a serious look towards:  1) Steamed Bun: five-spice pork belly and pickled vegetables in hoisin sauce between the softest steamed bun I've ever had.  The flavors all work well here and the texture of the pork and bun literally create a melt in you mouth experience contrasted by the light and bright crunch of julienned carrots and celery.  This is no more than 4 bites big, but the overall package is quite satisfying.  This may not be one to share.  2)  The Cheese Plate:  Too many restaurants don't put enough thought into this, but GFOM shows 'em how it's done.  3 words to prove it: Truffled Plum Chutney.  Yes my gastronomic friends, it is as good as it sounds and pairs well with a buttery soft cheese such as the Camembert it's current paired with.  The plate also includes two other cheese selections, each paired with another flavor-enhancing side, such as local honey and a port-fig reduction sauce.  The cheese portions are comparatively small, but the overall plate is enough to have you going for every last flavorful crumb.  And for my single best insider tip:  3) The Green Curry Mussels with Truffled Pomme Frites (aka Truffle fries).  These are actually two separate menu items, but regulars and servers will almost insist you order them together.  The mussels are steamed to perfection in the most-heavenly green curry broth made rich with coconut milk and then packed with slivers of fresh green herbs.  Eat the mussels quickly and then move on to sop up the sauce with your plate of truffled pomme frites.  Flavorful with the earthiness of truffle in their own right, the fries are just substantial and moist enough to act like a sponge with the green curry sauce.  The taste combination is crazy complex but hearty and satisfying.  This is culinary excellence at work and makes for a most satisfying meal.  Once that's done, the house-made dessert menu will stop by and it's always tempting with fresh, seasonal selections that are right-sized for two to share just a bite, without being some gigantic mess.  Current highlights there include banana pudding cheesecake (perfectly flavored without being too sweet) and a brownie with Biscoff ice cream.  Saving room will pay off here.  So when you want to impress a date with a somewhat hidden gem, this should be a go-to for you in Crown Town.  Consistently great, with the right atmosphere for a classy yet casual evening.  A True must-try!",

The host and bartenders were so nice and very helpful with recommendations and assurance on getting us seated asap. We went pretty late since we were aware of the waits there. The restaurant was very clean, the food was superb, staff was super friendly, and location made the wait bearable. Looking forward to going back. No food recommendations here because everything was impressive. Seriously",

I experienced both the Smoked Lamb Belly confit and the Pork Bun. I'll have to admit that my southern tastebuds preferred the latter experience to the lamb, but both were served in a nice presentation and cooked to perfection. I prefer roasted or grilled lamb to this more roast-like lamb, but the combination with the lentils was quite satisfying. The wine menu was limited but selective in its choices.",

We (party of six) put our name on the list at 6 and by 7, we had a table.  TAKE NOTE- if you don't want to wait at least an hour here--- be there when they open! It's a gem on Montford and people know Good Food has Good Food!!! We had a phenomenal server and the food experience was to-die-for.  Honestly, we ordered almost everything on the menu, including all three seasonal desserts and everything was perfection on a plate.  My top favorites were the steamed mussels, the steamed bun (never had anything quite like this!), and the desserts.  I loved, loved, loved the small plates experience with a large group because we each tried everything that came out..... The food comes out as it's prepared so it's hot and fresh and it's like a new surprise for your palate! I can't wait to go back!!!!",

We ordered a few apps for the table and they were amazing. We then proceeded to order a few different dishes EACH and not one person at the table had a negative word to utter.   I couldn't believe what I was tasting. Each bite was almost orgasmic....almost.   I loved this place. We tried it because we heard that the chef/owner also owns Barringtons which we also rate as a place to go.   Check this place out if you get a chance but plan to wait because they don't take reservations unless six or more people.",

    "text": "I've lived in Washington DC for the past 8 years and, honestly, Charlotte is not one of those cities I immediately think of as a \"foodie\" town. This is my third visit to Charlotte, and every meal I have eaten there has been nothing short of amazing. On a recent weekend trip, a good friend recommended we try out her favorite restaurant, Good Food. When we arrived, we were told the wait for a party of four was 2 hours. Ouch. But, we were had planned on hanging at the bar for a while, and it really gave us the chance to get nice and hungry for the meal.  Our group was all about trying lots of different things on the menu, and honestly, at some point, I think I lost track of what we ate. The cheese platter was an awesome way to start the meal -- all three (four?) cheeses were a big hit. As everyone has said, the mussels are to die for. There was more than a little bread dipping happening in the broth. The smell of truffle oil throughout the restaurant was overwhelming, so we had to indulge. Every calorie was well worth it. I personally had requested we order the braised duck fettuccine. I only wish I had some idea as to how that was made, because I could easily make that my last meal. But, the real show stopper... the mushrooms. Oh god. I want to drive the seven hours to get them just writing this. Nothing will ever replace the sentimental value of my grandmother's mushrooms, but these were out of this world. A beautiful smoky flavor with a complex stock and butter flavoring dancing with fresh herbs -- oregano, we believe? Yum, yum and yum.  Good Food is definitely on my I'll be back list. A full 5 stars would have happened if they would take reservations. My one and only negative comment about this fantastic place.",

Before ordering, we asked to have the check split between two couples, a request which has never been a problem in the past. We know the bottom of the menu advises that they do not do this...so we have appreciated the accommodation and always ask first.  We were quite surprised by the swiftness, tone and finality of her response, so someone said, politely, \" well it's just that we have been coming here for a while and they have always done it, but we understand.\" The next response was more of a retaliation  - we were told that she has worked there for 3 1/2 half years and they NEVER do this. We did not say anything further.   We each ordered 3 items. The items come out when ready from the kitchen, in no particular order and we were busy talking. By the time we noticed that one person had only gotten 1 item, everyone else was almost finished eating.  She said the kitchen didn't have the ticket, but it was obvious it was her mistake. The missing items finally came, just as we were ready to say forget it. They comped one item, and we got a half-hearted apology from the waitress, no manager in site. Likely we won't be back....",

My wife is pregnant, so she of course had to use the rest room and we said we would decide whether we were going to wait or not when she got back. Without discussion, when she came back I declined their invitation to grab a drink and wait, stating that I had to feed my lady and little lady to be. The manager was standing near and let us know that there was a party leaving from the dessert bar and if we waited a few minutes, he would have us seated! Sure enough, he did.   Be mindful, we're not snooty, entitled people with a hidden agenda. It was no big deal to us that they were busy and we were amicable about going somewhere else and returning to try their food in the future. But they warmly accommodated us without having to do so.   Sitting at the dessert bar was a treat we didn't know we needed. The food was amazing. The wait staff was great. Chris, the dessert bar chef, was stellar. He gave recommendations on food, desserts, and tips on having our first baby! We were absolutely spoiled tonight and we could stop raving about this place on the drive home. 10/10. Thank you again!",

    "text": "Really good tapas, a really nice mix of classic southern and modern fare. The dishes are cooked and served immediately so everything is piping hot and each has a secret sauce that the dishes are smothered in. Green peppers are one that I'm still craving today. Same with falafel. Fish was incredible and peach cobbler with blueberry ice cream is something everyone should try.   Only negative is that it's so popular! There was a 45 minute table wait on a Tuesday at 6 pm so we sat at the bar and it gets noisy there because that's also where all food is prepared. They may need more staff too, but they are on point with dishes.",

I ordered A few items but let me just say this... the spring rolls were absolutely invigorating. I've never tasted anything quite like it. We ended the night with satisfied hunger for sure. Oh and by the way, the staff is on point. After I got back to my hotel, I realized I couldn't find my phone. I hear a knock on the door and look what's found...my phone. Jonathan (I believe was the name) brought my phone to me ... at the Hyatt hotel... which is a 15 minute drive from the restaurant. Thank you!",

For food we ordered: -Poached egg at the recommendation of the waiter---This was our favorite. Perfectly cooked egg with a beet and cauli/some root sauce with diced veggies in the middle. Every bite was a perfect taste of southern comfort! -Steamed bun- This was good but just not as good as I remember! -Pasta with pork cheek- Cant remember the name of this but the pasta was more like potatoes. The combination of flavor was absolutely amazing. -Grilled octopus- So well cooked, which is difficult to do! -Brownie- I am not really a brownie girl but my hubby talked me into it. The brownie was perfectly gooey and the biscoff icecream was the perfect mix.  Good Food, you out did yourself!",

The mussels are in a green curry ,coconut milk , with cilantro . Oh, and they bring out bread with the meat so you can dip the bread in the broth.  So good!   This is a tapas place with good sizes portions so why not get the steamed bun which is also a must in my opinion. Honestly, I came here for a work outing as well and was able to try a lot of the menu options and wasn't disappointed one bit. Not typically a sweets fan when dining out but even too the servers recommendation and tried s couple desserts.    My only suggestion is to change the name of the restaurant to Great Food on Montford as it better team good :)",

So my friends and I came on a Friday night for a send off dinner. The wait was short since we got here before 7. The dishes tasted fine - the fried chicken and mussel were great, but the pasta, lettuce wrap, Korean beef and octopus were poorly seasoned; some were too salty and some lacked flavor. The dishes were $10-13 each; we thought the pricing was reasonable until we saw the octopus, which we waited for over 30 minutes but ended up disappointing - the dish wasn't even half full on the plate and was cooked way too salty and even a little burned.   I know a two stars from one review won't make a great impact but I just want to make my case.",

The server literally told me that if I didn't like anything on the menu he would pull out his own credit card and pay for it...that's how confident he was at everything on the menu was excellent.   Bout to put that to the test:  Smoked bourbon and mint julep. 'Nuff Said! Now I'm in the South!  My first bite was the venison carpaccio.   What a beautiful balance of texture and flavor. This was like eating in one bite the season \"Fall\".   Next up is the Korean beef with crispy rice and scallion kimchee.  OMG!   This is perfectly seared beef, on a square of crispy rice. Don't miss this when ordering. I'm not kidding. There were more layers of flavored in the sauce than I could even start to count back. The Server said there were over 25 ingredients in the one sauce.   Next Seared sea Scallops:  The best was saved for last.  Two Scallops served over Grilled Cantaloupe, with Jalapeno and cilantro.   Seasoned PERFECT! Seared like a boss! This was so delicious. Though, If I had my way the garnish of sliced red Jalapeno could be less on the platting. It could easily overwhelm the other favors going on.   Service: Outstanding, VERY knowledgable.  Presentation: Top Notch.  Fresh local ingredients.   If I lived here I'd be a regular.",

It is the perfect date night location. The only downside to this restaurant is that they don't take reservations and it is common to wait an hour or more on a Friday night. I assure you though, the food is worth every minute waited.   My go to selections are the Sticky Bun, Korean Beaf and Shrimp. The small plates give you an opportunity to share among the table and try it all. Don't get too full though because the desserts are to die for. The brownie with cookie butter is AMAZING!   What I love about this place though is I always leave filled, but not too full. It is fine dinning eating experience but reasonably priced.",

There is often a line when they first open the doors and they do not usually take reservations, so plan accordingly! It is a tapas style restaurant so plan on ordering at least 2 dishes per person. It is not cheap, but the cost-quality ratio is spot on! It's full service at the bar if you don't want to wait! Usually the bar fills up so you might have to wait for a spot to open up.

Too much to chose from and you will get filled up quickly. The tapas allows for variety and sharing which is always fun.",

I perused the menu and decided to try the Green Curry Mussels. I absolutely loved the green curry broth and the mussels that were perfectly cooked. This was served with a side of toast, which was quickly gone as I used it to sop up that delicious curry. Thankfully, one of the servers noticed that my bread was gone and brought me some more so that I could enjoy more of the yummy curry broth after all my mussels were gone.   I love the decor of the place and on a quiet night, this would be a great date place.  However, since I was by myself on this visit, I chose to sit at the bar. On the night of my visit Jonathan the bartender was very attentive and made sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my visit.    I didn't try any of the cocktails this time, but I definitely saw some delicious looking concoctions on the menu.  If you have not yet been over to GFOM, you should stop in sometime to give them a try. If you want to avoid the crowds that were mentioned by the other reviewers, do like I did and head over there early.",

My favorite which I always have on my mind when I think of this place is the Pork Belly Buns.  Probably not the best choice for your arteries, but will find a way in your heart to melt in your mouth.  Okay, that was a little personal, but date night recommended for sure!",

    "text": "Food: 4.5 Stars  Service: 1.5 Stars After wanting to try Good Food on Montford for months, I was finally able to yesterday evening with my girlfriend. The food definitely lived up to the name, but the service was absolutely horrible. We arrived around 5:45 and got a table immediately (no reservations are taken), but the place was full by around 6:15-6:30. Since it's tapas style, we started with the beer battered broccoli. The beer batter was heavy and added a good crunch to the outside of the broccoli, but the inside was still soft and tender which was great. There wasn't much cheddar taste other than in the bechamel style sauce underneath. The pickled jalapenos added no spice either, but it was very good overall.  Once, the broccoli arrived, we put in an order for the pork belly steamed bun with our waiter. We finished off the broccoli, waited, and waited. Our waiter checked on us after about 20-25 minutes and I went ahead and ordered the parmesan gnocchi while we were waiting since the pork bun seemed to be taking awhile. From the time we ordered it, the steamed bun took 35 minutes to get to the table, and our waiter never came back before it arrived to check on us or give us an update/take more orders. The pork belly was very tender, had a decent bit of 5 spice flavor, and a strong soy sauce flavor as well. The steamed bun was soft and a perfect pillow for the pork. Very good overall! The parmesan gnocchi came out after a bit more waiting, and it was excellent as well! The gnocchi were so soft, and the cream sauce had a strong but not overpowering parmesan flavor. It lacked many pieces of chicken or mushrooms as promised but was still awesome.  Overall, the broccoli was good, the steamed bun was delicious, and the gnocchi were out of this world, but it took over 30 minutes for both the steamed bun and gnocchi to come to our table after ordering, and our waiter really did not visit the table often enough. We spent nearly 2 hours at Good Food just to eat 3 plates, and we were going to order one more but decided we didn't have time since we were seeing a concert later in the evening and everything had been especially slow.",

We went for my birthday and my fiance described it as \"the perfect place to go when you can't decide what type of food [cuisine] you want.\" We enjoyed a nice variety of flavors and styles of dishes. The green curry mussels and the gnocchi were the two stand outs. I would have drank the curry sauce if that were appropriate, it's that good. We ordered the pommes frites to dip in the sauce as well as some extra bread. The gnocchi were light and airy and the sauce was rich without being heavy, highly recommended.   The pork bun was good but just not our favorite. My fiance loved the quail lettuce wraps and being quite knowledgeable of the bird, thought it was perfectly cooked. However, neither of us loved the sauce that was on the place beneath the lettuce wraps.   The blackberry bramble was also delicious and not overly sweet.",

She did a great job, confirmed our food choices and suggested some really good food. We had the poached egg, the squash pear soup, lamb gnocchi, curry mussels, and lemon grapefruit cheesecake. I would order everything else again, there's such a huge focus on texture and flavor that every dish has its own unique characteristics without being out of balance. The restaurant was busy when we came in, with almost every table full, but still quite enough to have a conversation and talk to the bartender. Despite being busy, the place ran like a top. It was a standout dining experience I would recommend to anyone!",

    "text": "Truthfully I give this restaurant and experience a 4.5 stars! I've been dying to visit good food on montford for years and I'm ashamed to say it took me so long to go! When we arrived the place was buzzing and every table in the place was full. It's a very small restaurant with about 20 tables in it, most of them are 2 tops. My fiance and I grabbed a glass of wine at the bar and quickly got sat at the \"back bar\" which is bar sitting right in front of a cook, Chris. I am so glad we were sat here because Chris made our experience amazing. You could tell this man has a passion for culinary and it was fun to watch him work.   We were explained that everything on the menu is tapas style. Most people order 2-3 items per person. We started off with the steam bun and carpaccio. I was very prepared for small portions but the one thing I am taking off half a star for is the steam bun. It's literally one bun. I think this should be 3 smaller buns which would make it more share friendly, since that's what you are going for with the tapas style. Now don't get me wrong the flavors of the steam bun were amazing! The carpaccio was so lovely because it had a southern twist to it with the pimento cheese and fried pickles. Again I'll note that we got a smaller portion on this then many photos I saw online. I get they are going small but don't skimp!   Next we ordered Chris' favorite the poached egg and our waitress' favorite the Italian sausage pasta. The egg was beautiful, larger than expected and very deep, rich flavor. The pasta was also larger in size and my fiance even commented that it would have been enough for an entree if he ate it solo. The pasta sauce was so bright and the sausage was filled with sage!   Our server was able to suggest great wines to pair throughout the evening! The wine list does not match what is ok the website. I think that should be updated because I had selected my choice before going and that no longer carried it.   After dinner Chris heard me speak of my nut allergy and he order us a chocolate dessert that was nut free!   Overall this place is amazing!! I would suggest to go during the week and not on weekends because the wait can be awfully long due to the size of the restaurant and people tend to take longer when eating tapas. They also update their menu according to what they can locally source and what's in season so each time you go you can received a completely different experience!   My vote is this is one of my favorite in Charlotte, right along with Roosters! This is a MUST VISIT!!!",

    "text": "While the food is good, the service easily knocked this joint down from four stars to two. Let's recap shall we?   We get there before they open. Me and my homie are chillin on the deck, enjoying the weather...  waiting for our other homie to come (who we find out is chillin in the car, listening to The Read).  They open, we're seated and immediately greeted by our waitress (who we find out later is a manager). She gave us the specials and popular dishes, explained they're a tapas place, etc, etc. We're given our water and some bread and balsamic/oil dip. She leaves us to look over the menu.   She returns after a few minutes. I ask, \"what are your more bulkier or bigger dishes\" she flatly says \"all the dishes are small because they're tapas\"   You're kidding me right? I know that. Chick what are the bigger dishes out of the whole menu cause I'm hangry. (I didn't say this)  But she does say that the pasta dishes are heartier. That's all she should have said in the first place.   My homie says it could be a culture thing, referring to her off-putting attitude. Shit in my culture, i give attitude and dont spare feelings, but there are times and places where that's acceptable. She agreed.   We order...  The falafel had good flavor and texture and could have used a bit more mint and sauce for freshness. I didn't ask (and I'm glad I didn't. I'll tell you why later)   The pommes frites were okay. They were a bit salty and I like ranch with my fries. They didn't have any so ketchup made it a bit better.   The carnitas was the best of the three dishes I had. While I'm not a big pomegranate seed fan, I still thoroughly enjoyed the dish.   Back to the ranch. Another lady who was chipper and friendly comes to the table. We ask if they have ranch. She says no but they have another sauce that goes with another dish, and it's like an herb ranch. Okay cool, we'll try that. We get it. It's small. My other homie wanted one. The manager comes back and we ask for another one. She said there's going to be a charge. For one? For both? I'm confused. She leaves. The friendly lady comes back. I ask if there's a charge for the sauce. She says no. I said the other lady said there was. They're both at the table now. Confusion ensues. In the end the Manager says she'll have the chef take the sauce off the bill. Manager seemed dead set at charging until friendly lady cleared everything up.   Fast forward to the bill. We get one check:  Homie E: \"Can we have three separate checks?\" Manager: \"we don't separate checks\" Me: \"soooo\" Manager: \"you can write out what you had and I'll take the payments\".... walks away  Homie E: \"how do we do this? Do we add tax?l Me: \"iono man\" Homie M: proceeds to neatly write on the card with who had what and puts the card/cash accurately on top of each section  Manager returns... Homie M: \"so I just put what we had and the amount...\" Manager: rolls eyes, looks confused. Leaves  Me: blood boiling, thinking as a manger her customer service skills SUCK! \"She sucks!\" Manager: \"blah blah blah, next time you'll need to write the amount not the dishes. Blah blah blah, I'll do it this time for you. Next time you need to do it. Blah\" Me: Looks across at another table with a big ace bowl of mussels and bread. What in the ever-loving.... \"look at that big bowl of food. That's what I meant by bigger dishes\" I'm never coming back to this bi... place\"  The End.",

    "text": "Good Food on Montford is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  They have a changing menu that offers a wide array of tapas-style sharing dishes that can delight the palette of just about anyone.  Service is great, the atmosphere is lovely, and the portions/value of the food is excellent.  On service - all the employees were very friendly and helpful with menu choices.  There was a small hiccup on our order and they comp'ed the dish without any hesitation and without even asking.  Our waters were full and someone was always around to see how we were doing.    On atmosphere - it's tight, but not too tight.  The lighting is homey - not too bright, not too dim.  The noise level is just right - it's bustling and you can definitely hear how busy it is inside, but you don't have to scream across the table to talk to whoever you are with.  The tables are somewhat close together, but you don't necessarily notice the conversations of other parties, nor does it take over your own conversation.  On food - everything on the menu looks appetizing.  It was hard to choose just a few dishes between the two of us, but the waitress was helpful in telling us how much or how little to order and was honest about it when she thought we ordered too much.  Thus, the amount was just right.  Beef carpaccio - beef was sliced very thinly and was fresh, but the pimento cheese was very much overpowering and you couldn't really taste it.  Probably the only complaint.  Truffle fries - they ended up forgetting this until the end of our meal and comp'ed it.  The fries could have been hotter and slightly more truffle flavor... if I had to give any feedback.    Gnocchi - holy.... best gnocchi ever, and a huge portion.  The flavor here was impeccable - a must order.  Steamed bun - a giant version of a steamed bun from any Japanese place. They give you a knife to cut in half.  I actually preferred this one over several other pork buns I've had around the US.  Mussels - a different take.  It's in a green curry base instead of the usual white wine and garlic base.  I prefer the latter, but this was still flavorful and a nice take on a staple item.  Banana bread dessert - this was a little bit too filling for us and not so much a \"dessert\", but it was still flavorful the macadamia ice cream was exceptional.  Would definitely return!  It's not good food... it's great food! (So  cheesy...)",

    "text": "When I see 4.5 stars on yelp with over 500 reviews, I pay attention.  We were looking for a nice spot for date night and some time for conversation. So...Good Food on Montford.   First, the good... The food was very tasty. We had 2 steamed buns (amazing), the fried chicken (very good), mushrooms (ok).   The staff was very helpful and friendly. Our waiter could tell it was our first time right away and he helped us enjoy the evening.   Now, the not as good... It was very LOUD...perhaps that's just a friday night or maybe that's the decibel level every night, but we were overwhelmed by how loud it was. I think if we were there with a party or a double date we would not have minded, but as a couple, it was hard to think, much less talk.   It was expensive...I know it's small plates/tapas, but based on my math, it should have been $$$ on yelp rather than $$. I simply didn't feel that the portions justified the price even though they tasted very good.   I really wanted to like GFonM. And, If you love loud, small plates places where you need to like the food to feel good about how much you spent there, then Good Food on Montford is for you.   I don't think we'll be back.",

    "text": "Truly one of my favorite restaurants of all time! Good Food is an upscale tapas restaurant with a variety of delicious options for any type of eater. They don't take reservations so I definitely recommend getting there right when they open at 5:30pm if you don't want to have to wait. Tonight I went with four people and we ordered the following:  the pommes frites (truffle fries), garganelli (x2), pork carnitas, steamed bun (x2), Korean beef, mussels, and scallops. My favorites were definitely the truffle fries, the garganelli and the mussels (the curry broth is amazing). For dessert we had the chocolate brownie and peach cobbler. It was plenty of food for 4 people and the bill was around $130 which I thought was very reasonable. They also had a great wine list- we ordered the Amarone which I don't normally see on many menus. Definitely worth visiting next time you're in Charlotte!",

    "text": "This kind of spot is just my jam.  Small plates, long bar with creative cocktails, unique flavors in a trendy yet casual setting - I'm in.  I've had GFoM on my radar (AKA Yelp Bookmarks) for a while now.  So a stay in the South Park area was the perfect time to check it out.    They don't take reservations but arriving at 6:30 pm on a busy Friday night, we only waited about 30 minutes for a table for four.    We tried a variety of dishes although as usual, I don't agree that you need two to three dishes per person.  We ordered seven dishes for four of us and left stuffed.  The food was all delicious and beautifully plated.  Of the dishes, the Garganelli (Italian sausage and pasta) was one of our least favorites.  It was just kind of boring compared to other dishes we ordered.  The steamed bun (another recommended dish) was very good but cut into four pieces, one order was plenty.  Our server was really pushing us to order two of the steamed bun.  Instead, we went with an order of Korean pork belly with rice cake noodles and kimchi that we all agreed was the home run of the night.  The charcuterie (especially the foie gras mousse) and cheese plate were both well portioned and delicious.  I'd way prefer a different cut to the mortadella though.  It's like high priced bologna.   All in all we were really happy with the food and had a great time.  Four stars is reflective of an overall positive food experience with a few minor misses and a server focused on upselling our order while being MIA for large parts of our meal.  We were actually going to order dessert but it took her so long to swing back around, our companions needed to head out and so we just asked for the check.  I'm also surprised they start off your meal with slices of white bread.  Random.  It was dry and we skipped it completely.  I think a cute amuse bouche would go better with their menu and keep appetites intact for the good stuff.",

Of these I highly recommend the mussels, but the Korean steak and the squid are amazing as well.  It's tapas style, so be prepared to pay up (each plate ranges from $6 to $15), about 2 to 3 plates per person is more than enough food.

The first experience was great and the food was REALLY awesome.  The dessert this go round was also excellent as well and we all enjoyed it.  Here's what I don't like:  We had a party of 4 and they don't do seperate checks.  When our waiter told us this I remembered that from LAST time.  Even in small parties..they won't seperate the check.  A little notice before ordering is a good way to let folks know that.  It's awkwardly small inside and tables are closer together than they should be.  It's weird sitting close to a 2 top table that is ovbiously on a date.  Other than that...it's great and I'll always go back...the food is on fleek! (haha learned that word last week)",

Each bite of the garganelli exploded with flavor and the addition of the Italian sausage exploded with flavor. The muscles were so great they're still on my mind the next day. Not normally a fan of coconut milk but it really did elevate the muscles to a whole new level. But in my opinion the fried chicken was the highlight of my meal, a True gift from the gods. Each bite so juicy and flavorful I literally went home and smacked my mother for ever feeding me something that didn't compare.

    "text": "My dinner at Good Food on Montford was easily the highlight of my recent trip to Charlotte! I arrived early into their dinner service on a Wednesday evening and, while enjoying a Rosemary Collins on the patio, I watched as the entire dining room filled up before my eyes. Thank you, Yelp, for steering me here; I can tell I'm in the right place!  I sat down to dinner at the bar and ordered three dishes:  - The Pork Bun: a MUST! I could have eaten half a dozen of these succulent little wonders. Sweet, salty, spicy, pillowy - perfection! - The Korean Beef: a tasty marinade and an elegant presentation made this a close second favorite. - The Carnitas tacos: enjoyable, but my least favorite of the three dishes. The meat was well-prepared but the whole dish reads a bit dry in the mouth; it was missing something to balance the mouthfeel. A mango salsa would have put it over the top!   The service at the bar was great and I enjoyed my leisurely meal with great relish. You may wish to note: if you are seeking to eat a full meal here, you should plan on about 3 dishes per person. Honestly, I could have gone for four. This puts a meal here squarely in the $$$ category, alcohol notwithstanding. The small plates here would also be great for a drinks-and-appetizers date as opposed to a full dinner.   I had a great experience here and I wouldn't hesitate to return for another special meal when I am back in Charlotte!",

Everything is pretty good,   my only complaint is the size of the good for the price you pay for it.  Staff is friendly.",

They serve tapas style so it's better to bring a few people so you can share and try a little of every dish. The food consists of southern cuisine and a few Asian fusion dishes as well. It takes around 2-3 dishes to fill you up. Their desserts are truly worth saving room for at the end. Every single dish I got was delicious and cook to perfection. The only dish I wasn't fond of was the gnocchi but it just my personal taste bud. I would definitely recommend this place! Also, it's super busy so I recommend trying to get their early or get a reservation down.",

    "text": "It was an enjoyable evening & I'm glad we went.  It can be difficult to get seated as they don't reserve for any group smaller than 5.  The bar is first come first serve.  We ended up snagging a bar seat after about an hour.  It is extremely loud in this small space.  This is not for a romantic evening or quiet tete a tete.  The staff were welcoming & accommodating.  Every one that we came in contact with were friendly & helpful.  We started with the Montford Gin Sour & they were soooo refreshing!  The food is portioned well & generous for tapas, I think, but it's nicer that there is enough to share without feeling like you're giving up your bite!  We started with the Charcuterie Plate & it was definitely enjoyable.  Especially the Chicken Liver Mousse & the Mortadella.  We moved on to the Sweet Pea Risotto & it was lively & perfectly cooked, with plenty of yummy, fresh, young peas that popped in your mouth!    Next we moved on to two pastas... The Garganelli with Sausage, Garlic & Tomato - that was filled with sausage, not too garlicky & just enough tartness to the chunky tomatos.  The Pappardelle Moroccan spiced lamb cheeks, lemon creme fraiche, and mint was good, but it was waaaay to spicy for my palate.  I couldn't even taste the mint or creme fraiche and I ended up taking the Garganelli home to finish later, because after I ate the Pappardelle I couldn't taste the other one!  Last but not least we tried the Pork tenderloin. shnitzel style, grilled potato salad, poached egg and mustard.  It had good flavor, but it was a bit overdone, not quite burned, but getting close & that affected the texture & flavor.  The grilled potato salad was different and very enjoyable & I don't usually like potatoes.  The desserts looked good, but we didn't try them.  It is pricey to dine a la carte like this, but for a once in a while splurge, not too bad.  There wasn't anything we tried that we felt we would have a craving for (except may the gin sour), but we are happy this neighborhood gem is around.",

Its been a little while since I've been so I'm not really going to review the food.  I just saw that they don't hold the #1 spot as per best place in Charlotte and I thoroughly disagree, hope this bump helps.  An evolving menu and locally sourced ingredients all while being served in a non pretentious atmosphere.  If executed right, that's all I want in life.  Unless its an important date out I don't need the quiet candle lit vibe.  That is it, I'm cutting this one short.  I'll update soon hopefully.  Maybe you should read some other current reviews to get an idea of whats on the menu right now.  Heads up though, no reservations.  You have to go put your name on the list and it can take some time as this place is pretty small.  I'd recommend putting your name up and if its more the 45 mins or so grab a beer close by.  They'll call you.  But do buy a cocktail when you are seated.  Bat staff is spot on.",

Most impressive is that, even while the ingredients may not be your favorite, you can taste how smart the flavor combinations are.  Pro tips: 1. Always order the soup-whatever it is. 2. The mussels, frites and steam bun are house staples and I start battling with myself hours before we arrive to not order all three every time.  3. Listen to the server's recommendations.  4. Take a dining mate with whom you are comfortable-not a first date joint.  Atmosphere is close and cozy and the dishes are for sharing.    Everything that's going on here seems to be on purpose and, in my opinion, absolutely perfect.  I realize this sounds like a love letter but, truth be told, I love Good Food.  I imagine every restauranteur strives to have something this impressive.  Good Food is the best restaurant in Charlotte and anyone who tells you different has either never been there or they're telling you a lie.  ;)",

Generally, the wait staff has always been very friendly and attentive.  At this visit, it seemed like they were understaffed and just did not care about the restaurant patrons.  Also, some of the runners looked as if they just crawled out of bed.  Good Food is generally recognized as a good spot for an intimate dinner; as such, I would think their staff would care more about appearances and at least tuck their t-shirt in.    Onto the good (the food). We had the sangria, pommes frites, falafel, gnocchi, steamed bun, and the korean beef.  The sangria was excellent, I could drink those all night.  The pommes frites and the falafel are great apps.  The pommes frites were excellent as always.  The falafel was very tasty and the tzatziki sauce was wonderful, I wish they would put more of the sauce on the plate.  The gnocchi is very reminiscent of chicken and dumplings, it is delicious! I haven't ever had a bad pasta at Good Food. The steamed bun was really great, it's a Good Food staple and a must-try! The only bad part about our actual food was the Korean Beef.  It was fatty and we couldn't even finish the beef.  Such a disappointment as it has previously always been my favorite dish at Good Food.  Overall, not the best experience as we were looking to have a romantic intimate dinner.  I certainly won't go back when I want attentive service for the rare date-night.",

Anyway, we start at Duckworths (Duh) and work our way down to Good Food for dessert. Most of us have eaten at other establishments, and decided to get some of their awesome desserts!  So.....we order 3 things: 1) A Brownie with a homemade Biscoff (Belgian) Ice Cream (HELLO!), 2) A Red Velvet Cupcake with homemade crazy good frosting (Hello 2!) and 3) A \"hot\" (meaning SPICY not temperature) Chocolate Martini (HELLO 3!).  Well suffice it to say everything was FANTASTIC! Gotta love the Moffit brothers as they implement their vision of GREAT food in Charlotte!   I've eaten here before and absolutely loved it! So my 5 star rating includes those aweseome meals from before......  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

    "text": "Good food on Montford, was literally one of the best meals I've ever had.  Each dish seemed to get better!  From my first beer to desert I didn't want this meal to end!!!  We started with the Beef Carpachio.  SO GOOD!  For those who only eat beef well done, you are really missing what beef taste like.  The Fried Pickles & Pimento Cheese made this so perfect.      From there we had the Sauteed Mushrooms, Steamed Bun, Korean Beef, and the PEI Mussels.  Though I've seen the steamed bun on TV, this was my first time having one.  It was great!  I'm very picky about my pork belly.  Some places don't cook it enough and I just feel like I'm eating a mouth full of pork fat, but Good Food knocked it out of the park!  The Korean Beef was like a tapas portion of Bi Bim Bop, which is my favorite Korean dish.  I could have eaten 10 of these.  Not because the portion was small, but because it was so good.  The mushrooms accompanied both of these perfectly.  One of my favorite things in this world are PEI mussels of any kind.  My favorite curry at a Thai place is green curry, so this was a match made in heaven.  Best green curry I've ever had.  I literally finished the curry with a spoon when I ran out of mussels/bread.  Yes that may have been crass, but if you tasted it I'm sure you'd do the same!!!  Don't be weary of the fact that it is Tapas place.  The portions are good size.  I definitely left full.    We finished with with the Peach Cobbler.  OMG.  I generally go for a Whiskey for desert (truth be told I did), but I had to try the cobbler.  It was amazing.  My wife got mad since my desert was suppose to be the Bulliet Rye on the rocks, and I ate half her desert.  The shortbread crust was what put it over the top, but every component was perfect.  This was hands down one of the best meals I've EVER had.  I can't wait to come back to Charlotte just to eat here again.  Worth the money, wait, etc.  Service was impeccable, but even if the service was terrible, the food would have generated 5 stars!  Kudos Good Food on Montford!",

    "text": "FINALLY! *insert clap emoji here*  I always have the urge to come to this place on a Sunday but like Chik-fil-a  this place is CLOSED. I already knew what I was going to order so I just scanned over the menu to see if anything else was worth ordering.  Started out with the falafel. Who knew those tiny pieces of deep fried legumes would be so good. Emphasis on tiny. I really wish they were larger.  Had the pomme frites next. So underwhelming. Everyone raves about the fries but I didn't find anything special about them. If you want good pomme frites Lumiere is the place to go.   Out came the gnocchi and Korean beef. Both plates...delicious. I couldn't find anything that was off with either of the two.   I was rushed because I had somewhere to be at 8pm but I will definitely be back to explore the rest of the menu and fully enjoy the atmosphere and food. Also service was fantastic!",

The table next to us also had the same problem. We brought it to the attention of the manager and she was obviously embarrassed but very defensive about the whole situation. My issue is that if there's black mold on a bottle of panna, that is also kept in the same fridge as their produce (per the head chef) , how could there not be mold in the fridge or other food items. Not sure I'll come back. P.S. They did not replace the water.",

We had the charcuterie, sauteed mushrooms, garganelli, gnocchi, pan seared scallops and for desert the salted caramel cobbler. Literally everything was delicious! My favorite were the sauteed mushrooms, perfectly cooked and with a slight salty and garlic flavor but not overpowering. I also loved the garaganelli, I thought the portion was larger than everything else we ordered and the sausage was delicious ! Slightly spicy which I loved! Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Walked in and was a little slow getting seated so I was left standing there for a while. Definitely a great date place, with a little bit of a laid back setting. Open brick walls and Waitress told me about 3 items which have been on the menu since the restaurant opened. (Pei mussels, steamed Bun, and Garnelli), then gave me a little time to decide. Wow even the bread amazed me here!!!! Crispy crust, and warm and soft innards.  PEI (Prince Edward Island) mussels $12 - 15 small /mussels with green curry sauce and a pita. The curry sauce is amazing and I've seen people dip all kinds of things in it including the pomme fries, the bread , the rice from the Korean BBQ. Sadly the mussels were a little underwhelming. And definitely on the small side. I do love the idea of mussels and green curry sauce though and this is a must have.  Pomme Frites  $6 MUST HAVE - Holy Moly Guacamole! The fries are heavily seasoned so if you dont like heavily seasoned fries these aren't for you. Each bite of the fries is super salty and when dipped in the above curry, you get an unique taste.  Korean Beef with Rice $12 - This was probably the worst of the three tapas I got. Three different types of sauces, a small portion of fried rice, and a small portion of fried ribs. Ribs were soft and tender, but you can get better short ribs elsewhere.  Chocolate Cookie icecream cookie $7 MUST HAVE - This was by far the best icecream sandwich ever. Two white chocolate macadamia nut cookies with cajeta icecream (Mexican Caramel icecream) sandwiched in between the cookies. Then they dip the entire side of the cookie with white chocolate and macadamia nuts. They gave me a knife and a spoon to cut the icecream, but it was difficult and I suggest just getting one just for yourself. THIS ICE CREAM MADE THIS REVIEW 5 STARS!  Overall a great restaurant, with quaint decorations and country music. I would come again.",

Small plate and tapas restaurants offer a really unique and interesting business model. I appreciate the speed of service, turnover rate, and quality of food. Given the margins with the costs of operating, it's a highly under-noted form of genius.   With that said, the prices are pretty damn high. Portion-wise you're getting shafted, albeit not by a whole lot, but I'm not one that just loves paying $22 for 3 slices of rare beef that's the thickness of paper. The food and drinks are tasty though. We tried about 6 different things and all were notably well done.  Nothing bad to say about the service, but do not attempt to get a table any time after 6pm on Friday or Saturday unless you're cool with waiting for at least an hour.  This is a cool spot in an area with an identity problem. Worth checking out one time if you can stand to wait or eat dinner super early. The True score here is 3.5/5, but I'll give it a 4 because the food is...good.",

I think I raved about the mussels for a week straight after last time I came here. They are always on the menu too, although their menu is seasonal.  I could go into detail about the other menu items, but the mussels must be given their credit! 5 stars themselves.   ps. One time we came here we got the 'Chefs counter' at the bar and had a great time. The Chef was very personable and gave us a few freebies for tasting- can you say biscotti ice cream and pork belly boa buns?! Maybe not together, but they were both awesome! I think I was spoiled so much that next time I come back I'll need to sit at the Chefs counter again!",

Not only did I know this place was going to be a wait but just the simple fact of the sheer number of people who continually told me how good \"Good Food\" was as a restaurant .   The place is really cozy and really feels like one big dining room in a really expensive house with a bar. The reason I say that is because you feel right at home with the colors and decor that welcomes a sense of intimacy unmatched in most place in Charlotte.  Our services was very prompt and provided great  knowledge of the foods while along with great recommendations!    We order the cauliflower soup, assorted cheeses, gnocchi, lettuce wraps, beef with fried pickles and cheese.   I like the texture of everything I tasted as it was fresh and appeasing to my palate. My favorite besides the cheese ,because I am addicted to cheese, was the gnocchi.   The gnocchi had duck inside of it as it was cooked perfectly to give it a balance of just the right taste without being too overwhelming. The sauce was amazing and tasted homemade instead of out of a can.   Honestly I don't have anything bad to say beside be ready to wait. It seems sometimes good things are worth the wait . In this case Good Food is definitely worth the wait! Happy eating!",

Each dish comes out with a beautiful presentation and the taste of each dish is also on the same level as the presentation. We ordered a variety if items such as the Korean Beef, Creamy French Onion Soup, Gnocchi, Pommes Frites, Grilled Squid, Fried Oysters, and Ube Cheescake. There was not a single dish I did not like.   One of my favorites was the Korean Beef. Being really biased and picky with Asian food, I applaud the chef on this dish. The beef was cooked to perfection and was succulent and rich in flavor, melting on your tongue. The rice was not dry with the perfect crisp on top. The best part about this dish was the sesame sauce on the side. It paired amazingly well with the beef and was absolutely amazing.   In general, every single dish came out perfect. The seasoning was on point, things that were supposed to be crispy were crispy, and flavors paired well together. The Ube Cheescake was nothing like I have ever had, it is extremely hard to find a place that serves anything with Ube in the city. The flavor was slight but perfect and it was not too sweet. The service was impeccable, and our waiter, Craig, was beyond attentive and seems to be an all around friendly guy. I will definitely be back, no doubt!",

However, those are not the reasons why you should look somewhere else for great food and great service.  This is a restaurant with great food and good whiskeys for friends to have a great laugh and create good memory.  If you do end up visiting this lovely place, then I would suggest you go there a little bit early so you do not have to wait in line.   If you do end up dining there, then I would strongly recommend you to order their steamed bun and mussel. The steamed bun is not to share I would say because it is that good. And I do not think you will share once you take a bite of the sticky and sweet pork belly among with the soft and fluffy bun. If you still have bread left, don not forget to dip it into the light green curry sauce that the mussels were bathing in.  Oh... they also have a good list of whiskeys if you are into whiskey.",

Must tries are the steamed bun and Korean beef. The chicken liver mousse on the charcuterie plate is the best I've ever had.  I suggest saving room for dessert as they are always delicious.

    "text": "Service and host both helpful and friendly. Not a big place though, so our party of 6 actually had to wait 90 minutes for a table even though we arrived at 5:40pm. Everything is tapas style, so stuff comes out as it's ready. The fastest were the steam bun and the mussels, and the longest wait was for the gnocchi and the Korean beef. Everything was really delicious, but portions are not large, so expect to order at least 2 items per person for a full meal. My husband and I ordered the steam bun, the mussels, and the Korean beef and then we also ordered two cocktails (one each) and our total was about $60 (before tip)... and we were both still hungry. Dessert options all sounded good, but we saw they were similarly small portions for the price, so we passed.  Worth noting: they do not split checks, but they will apply multiple payments, so if you're with people, plan on pulling out calculators to do the math and tell your server how much to charge on each card. Also, they add an automatic 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more.  The food was good but not worth the wait or the price (for such small portions) in our opinion. In a city like Charlotte, there's too many options to bother with \"good but not great\".",

    "text": "So to wrap up a year long project in Charlotte, the team decided to hit up Good Food for our final team meal. I had been a few times and have enjoyed myself here and figured it was a good spot to celebrate everything the team had accomplished. We were able to score a table relatively easy on a Monday night and showed up with our group of 6. We were greeted promptly at the door with smiles and immediately brought over to a table with menus in hand. The servers were very attentive throughout the meal and I appreciate the \"joking around\" she was doing with the table as it certainly lightened up the mood.  We looked at the menu and we decided to order a whole array of dishes given the plates here are relatively small. That is something to note for people thinking of showing up in groups more than 4, is that sharing can be difficult so you will want to plan out how to share everything evenly. After perusing the menu, we went with the charcuterie board, the cheese board, carpaccio, falafel, pommes frites, the sauteed mushrooms, the garganelli, the gnocchi, pork carnitas, the steamed buns, the Moroccan spiced chicken sausage, fried chicken, Korean beef, and the scallops. We essentially ordered almost everything minus the seafood given the dietary restrictions at the table. The server was able to balance all the food as well as kept the drinks flowing with ease. As mentioned we ordered a few things twice because of lack of availability to share and focused on those that were extra good. The charcuterie board and cheese boards were nice dish to share with the table and was standard cuts across the board making it easy to eat. The carpaccio was DELICIOUS and had good flavor with the pimento cheese and we ended up ordering two of these for the table. The Falafel was good and the greek yogurt sauce was good but we ended with one helping as it didn't have a special kick or lacked that extra \"umph\". The pommes frites were good as well and standard fries with truffle oil which you obviously cant go wrong with. The sauteed mushrooms are absolutely delicious and I probably inhaled an entire plate by myself. Its just a simple clean dish with fresh herbs and sliced garlic but boy is it addictive. The garganelli was delicious with the home made Italian sausage being on point with the simplicity of the red sauce to it. We HAD to order two of this and it went fast. The Gnocchi is always a show stopper here and is really well made. It was another crowd pleaser and candidate for two. The Steamed buns are probably another top item and is better than some Asian restaurants I had been to. It's essentially a big pork bun and again a perfect candidate for ordering more than one order given the size. The pork carnitas was good but not something that warranted extra stomatch space so we moved on to the Moroccan spiced chicken sausage. It paired well with the tahini and we got a few orders of these as the meat was spiced and cooked really well. The fried chicken was good with the collard greens on the side and again another crowd pleaser. The  Koren beef was a good attempt at a fusion dish but ultimately fell short and the scallops were the same deal where it was good but not worth another pass.  All in all, this is a great restaurant with great service and certainly one of the better establishments in Charlotte. Some of the dishes are just really strong dishes with others being good. Definitely worth the visit so make sure to drop by",

Actually, everything we ordered was fantastic. I wouldn't change a thing. Our server was not overbearing, but made sure we had what we needed. What's more, the place doesn't have an ounce of pretension--unlike so many other restaurants in Charlotte. Bruce and Kelly Moffat know how to tantalize your taste buds.

It has been more than few months since I have been in to eat so I was hoping for the same great experience as I had last time.  I'm confused did they get a new chef because it seems something has changed in the food........ I might not have a ton of cooking experience but the tastes seem to excite me more than my recent experience. Like my favorite the steamed bun, which has always made my mouth water, it felt like it was dry and needed salt and the glaze was much weaker.  I was also hoping for some more seasonal options for a seasonal restaurant. The brussel sprouts in the gnocchi seemed a little weird for being almost summer and the bacon was not crispy, it tasted really undercooked, it just was not pleasant for a mouth feel.  Where do you even get brussel sprouts right now, besides Harris Teeter? I just felt that the love for the food wasn't there compared to my previous experiences.  I hope that my opinion matters some what to Chef because I think he is or was truly amazing. I definitely give Good Food another chance, it is still and will still be one of the best restaurants in Charlotte dining no matter what I think.  My taste buds are still sad though.................",

It wasn't too sweet which is how I like my mules.  We ordered the cheese plate and it was some of the best pairings I've had.  The gnocchi was to die for!  The garganelli was way too salty but other wise had a good flavor (I think it was a one off).  My husband wanted the octopus and it was played perfectly and tasted even better than it looked.  I'm saving the best for last.... THAT BROWNIE THO..... so amazing I didn't know a brownie could taste like that.  The atmosphere was pleasant, romantic, and had the perfect mix of music playing quietly in the background.  One warning...do not expect this to be a cheap meal.  In my opinion it was worth it!",

Needless to say I think Boston is an excellent food city so had to find a good place to hold its own, lemme tell ya Good Food did not disappoint! We started with the cheese plate which was excellently paired with jams.  Other highlights were the gnocchi and the steamed bun.  OH MY GAWD that pork belly steamed bun! Must have if you go!  Drinks were excellent! A few good local drafts and excellent service.  It was crazy busy, even for a Tuesday night (hey don't do reservations) so we sat at the bar.  Service was excellent and bartender was very knowledgeable.  For dessert we had the pot de creme which was a chocolate/espresso dessert and it was amazing as well!  Can't wait to go back to this place and will definitely be a go to for impressing out of downers!",

It came with two sliders, but the bread was not as fresh. My second favorite dish was the Steamed Bun. It was ridiculously good & is a must try for first timers.

    "text": "Having been to Barrington's and throughly enjoyed it, my wife and I decided to visit its sister restaurant.   We got there at 6ish on a Monday. There were plenty of open tables at this time, so we were seated right away. Our server was friendly. She explained that we could order anything we wanted in any order. She also said that if we knew everything we wanted to try, but didn't want to flag her down whenever we were ready for our next course, she could take down our requests at the beginning and spread out the orders for us. This was impressive, because servers at tapas restaraunts like this have to be busy constantly. She was willing to monitor our progress with each course and time when to have the next dish fired off. She was definitely a pro.  We started with the charcuterie dish. Mortadella, speck, soprasetta, and a chicken liver/foie gras mousse topped with sweet, minced, pickled shallots. This came with grilled toast points. Quite tasty. My wife, who isn't a big fan of pate, even liked the mousse. Some of the speck was too fatty, but it was a good dish overall.   Next, we had the Garganelli. The sausage was house-made (it had better be). The pasta and sauce reminded me of the Gnocchi I had at Barrington's, which is one of their signature plates. This was a solid dish.   Then, we had the Seafood Tortellini, which was actually ravioli. Not sure what that was about. This was the most disappointing dish for me. The lobster foam, pasta, and chanterelles actually worked really well together. It may have been the best-tasting dish for me, but I couldn't find any lobster or crab to save my life. If I'm paying $16 for a small dish with 4 ravioli that are \"filled\" with lobster and crab, I have to be able to find some lobster and crab. I wasn't expecting a lot, but there was practically none. Not cool.   We were pretty much full by the time our Vietnamese-stuffed Quail came. Our server told us that, although it didn't say it on the menu, the quail was actually filled with shrimp and pork. If she hadn't told me that, I wouldn't have noticed. (I did managed to discover a tinge of ham when I reheated my leftovers). The quail was fried, halved, and served on lettuce. It came with marinated cucumbers, which were pretending to be pickles. It sort of looked like a deconstructed chick-fil-a sandwich. My wife thought it tasted like a chicken finger. It was served with a tangy chili-lime dipping sauce rather than honey mustard.  I washed all this down with a pint of NoDa's Hop Drop 'N Roll, which is an excellent local beer. Good call on their part in having this in stock.   All in all, it was a good experience. We checked this off on our list of places to try and discovered a new love for lobster foam. If we do end up going again, I'll try the pommes frites and steamed bun. Those seem to be home-runs according to everyone else. I'll also be skeptical of any dish they have that claims to be stuffed with seafood.",

    "text": "Have been wanting to try this place for a couple of years and it was worth the wait. Small plate style service which is fun with small groups of 4-6. They don't take reservations so plan to get there early when they open for dinner or be prepared to wait for a good bit. They also don't do split checks but will split payment between a couple of people.  The pork buns are one of 3 dishes that have been on the menu since opening and we can see why. The menu changes so it's hard to suggest dishes but if the pork carnitas are on the menu GET THEM. They will give the pork buns a run for their money.  Suggestion of what not to get - cheese plate or charcuterie. Both are a little underwhelming compared to offerings at other restaurants for a similar price point. The charcuterie was passable especially with the fois gras and chicken liver pate.",

I sat a little closer to strangers than I usually like but it didn't matter because of the food. Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  It's a tapas place and they recommend 3 dishes per person. Not everything we ordered was on the menu that they have online so be easy on me as I try to recall what we ate.  We started off with fried broccoli  (which was by total accident, the waiter put in the order wrong so we got it for free). It was pretty good. The sauce is on the bottom which we didn't realize at first.  Next came our tiny little falafels. Tiny yet tasty.  Korean Beef with crispy rice.... yummmmmm!!!  I want to say we then had Quail lettuce wraps. They aren't on the online menu but they were amazing.  Followed by the Steamed bun- a piece of heaven landed in my mouth.  I know we had something else before dessert but for the life of me I cannot remember.  For dessert I had the chocolate martini and he got the brownie. The icecream served with the brownie tasted just like a teddy gram!!!  I am so pleased with Good Food and cannot wait to go back there!",

So it wasn't quite as busy. We opted to sit at the bar! I ordered a black punch and my friend ordered a bourbon mule. Both drinks were watered down. I wasn't sure if it was me or the ice on the drinks. My friend only had one. I opted for another to make sure. Yes by the time I had the 2nd one. It tasted water down.. The two plates I ordered was ok.. Fairly expensive. And I love tapas/small plates. I had the shrimp boil and the Korean beef. The shrimp boil have no flavors. Very bland. Korean beef was very good. Not excellent for the amount you paid for.. That night we met a couple of crazies.. Not sure if they believe in our personal space., and the ambiance was very loud and busy.. Hard time hearing.. If I want good food and a good place to chat with my girls. I wouldn't pick this place..",

Took one of the bartenders 10 min to differentiate or even recognize that we were wanting to order drinks. Then later after getting seated, the server we had we needed to flag her down each time we needed her (perhaps in the weeds, we'll give her the benefit of the doubt). That was not ideal.   Lastly, we were finishing up dessert and immediately noticed that the host was hovering and trolling over our table to push us out to seat the next group. Wasn't our fault that our server was MIA in providing us with our bill.  Be prepared to be patient with the staff.",

    "text": "One of our favorites in Charlotte, hands down! We love going with a big group and ordering tons of their small plates to share so we taste a little bit of everything their diverse menu has to offer. Equally fun is going with just your sweetie so you don't have to share anything! All the pommes frites for meeeeeeee!   Speaking of pommes frites... they're one our standby favorites along with the garganelli (that house made sausage, though), beef carpaccio and PEI mussels. The rest of their menu changes pretty frequently which is fun but also a little sad when a great dish disappears. (Please bring back the shrimp arepas for all that is good and holy!) Good beer selection, even better wine selection, one of the best cocktail menus.   I was on the fence about their deserts for a while and while we still order a dud every now and then (I don't love the cobblers or cinnamon rolls) overall, I think they've finally found their stride with the sweets! The pumpkin cheesecake is divine. I love the bits of candied ginger hidden on top in the whipped cream. The cannoli cheesecake and banana bread are also tasty. Even just a scoop of their ice cream (might I recommend the goat milk dulce de leche) and an espresso will treat you right at the end of the night.   Service is phenomenal. We miss Jeffrey who just recently moved away. Now that he's gone, we always ask for Jackie... One of the sweetest, most adorable humans on the planet!",

Just wish they had made it public knowledge that they changed the menu at Good Food, to test new dishes for his new up and coming restaurant in Plaza Midwood. Surprisingly, was not a fan of most of the test items. Most items were much more calorie laden and heavy than usual. Also, the quality was not there, but maybe why they are testing! I was also in the mood for what Good Food usually offers, which is why we decided to eat there tonight. However, still had great service.  Guess I'll take a break until the old recipes of the former menu come back. Sure hope it returns soon, even though I understand why they need to test.",

    "text": "As a native Charlottean, I have head about Good Food for a long time. We went for the first time this past weekend, and I certainly understand the hype! This place reminded me of the casual, elevated dining Ive experienced and loved in Columbia and Charleston. Exposed brick walls, warm ambient lighting, brown paper tables, great wine and cocktail service, attentive waiters, and a local, neighborly vibe. The food was delicious. Expertly refined with all the finishing touches. We had the falafel, calamari, gnocchi, and farfalle. We will definitely be back again, I certainly recommend it to anyone! Just be advised, the wait is pretty unexpected so I would recommend using the no wait app, which was very helpful! *Only reason for 4 star rating instead of 5 was because the falafel could have had a kick of pizazz, something unexpected or a twist on the classic combo, the calamari was great, but it was regular fried calamari with a mayo aioli on top, again could have had a kick of pizzazz for being a tapas plate, and the farfalle just needed a tiny bit of acid to balance the oil. I'm being a hard critic because each plate has major potential to being a knock out with just a tad more creativity!!",

They are \"small\" plates but really we were all WAY stuffed with one per person and maybe one to share. The staff was kind. Cons - The wait is always incredibly long so make a reservation. It's pricey but worth it and also quite loud.  I definitely feel the need to try it again soon!",

    "text": "After reading all the great reviews I figured it was time to try Good Food on Montford for myself. Seating was quite close to other diners so there wasn't a ton of privacy; it felt as though every diner could hear the conversations of the tables to the left and to the right of them. Not a huge deal but something to take note of. Service was polite and well paced and the menu was diverse. The curry mussel dish and pork belly bun were definitely our favorites. The desert menu was enticing. Unfortunately they were out of the cobbler only two hours into service so I was unable to order that which was disappointing. I settled for the brownie instead and it was very good. Ultimately, we left happy and full so it was a positive experience.",

    "text": "This is my go to spot to bring out-of-town visitors. Great variety of tapas, excellent service, and fun drinks make this a fun and delicious restaurant. There is almost always a wait, but they will take your phone number and text you when there is a table ready. Montford has some great bars in the area that are walking distance, so I would recommend checking out Moosehead or Barreled at the Lift if you want to get a couple drinks while you wait. I really enjoy the variety of the tapas. Whether you like seafood, meat, or are a vegetarian, there are plenty of great options. I would recommend about 1-2 per person depending on how hungry you are during your dining adventure.  Some of my favorites include: The mussels-not a big curry fan but the cilantro curry sauce is worth drinking or at least asking for some extra naan bread to dip. Steamed Bun-the bun is soft and melts in your mouth, and the pork belly is delicious. Great dressing and veggies on the pork bun as well. I would go here just for the steamed pun. Pommes Frites-great truffle oil taste with a touch of parmesan.  Garganelli- similar to a penne pasta with Italian sausage. Some of the best tomato sauce I've ever had, and I'm Italian! Very tasting drinks as well!  Parking is tough, but I typically will Uber or Lyft here so it makes it much easier. I would definitely recommend for anyone who loves tapas or great food.",

They were busy and I was pleased that the service was good! They have a parking lot but you can also park on the street.   I got the korean beef with crispy rice. It does take a while for it to come out but it is worth it. I'm usually not a fan of crispy rice but since the beef was so smooth, it was a good mix. Beef was melt in your mouth. I would definitely get this again. Two sauces with it were amazing! It was actually pretty filling!  I also go the udon noodles. You can tell the noodles were homemade which were awesome. Pork was really good. It's more on the fatty side which I like. Kimchi was spot on. The sauce really reminds me of kimchi soup. Perfect amount of sesame seeds.   I'm half korean and I would have to say the food was pretty spot on. I would definitely get those two items again next time!",

We gave in to the sunken cost of time and super glad we did. Food was amazing! This is a tapas type place where dishes are served appetizer-sized, and diners are encouraged to share. We started off with the usual warm bread and oil/vinegar dip. Ordered the pork belly buns, shrimp and lentils, curry mussels, gnocchi, and mushrooms. I highly recommend the buns and mussels. I could eat them all day. I love mushrooms, and the mushroom dish surprised me with the assortment. So yummy. I happen to love potatoes too, and gnocchi tasted like a loaded baked potato... but in gnocchi form, hahah. My least favorite was the shrimp dish. While cooked well, the lentils didn't seem to match the shrimp. Unfortunately, didn't have room for dessert, but there's always next time! Service was top notch.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews below, I decided to take a chance on Good Food. I agree with reviewers who says it is good food not great food. I'm usually skeptical when I see posts about a place being expensive because I cook at home and I know what real food costs. The plates are small. Like you have to be really-kind-to-share small. Give your fellow diner a lick off your plate and then no more. The restaurant has its own parking which was a plus and we got there right at 5:45p so no wait for us. I like that they've got seating outside with tables so if you have to wait someone's thought about your comfort while you do. The restaurant is cozy inside and I can see if it's packed you feel like you can't wait to finish and go.   Onto the food, we ordered the gnocchi, the Korean beef and the fries. I considered the cheese plate but then I saw it walk with tiny squares o' cheese. The gnocchi were good and the most generous of the three items. I would order them again. The Korean beef had about 4 slices of meat on a 3x3 square of rice with scallions on top. Spicy and cooked medium to medium rare. The fries were good, too but we are spoiled and we were looking for something to dip them in. Somehow fries always need aioli to dip.   The bill came to $53 with a $5 NODA on tap and a $13 sangria. I could've skipped the sangria because 1) it was more money than a plate of food and 2) it was more of a mixed drink than a sangria. I will say after two years of living in Charleston, I am biased but I know I'm not alone. So if you've only lived in Charlotte, you might love this place but I can't say we did.",

Nice guy and enjoyed watching him prepare the different dishes. Started with the beer batter broccoli. Not a fan as it really didn't have a lot of taste. Should have had the frites... Next came the Korean beef which was full of flavor. Also tried the shrimp and the gnocchi. Both did not disappoint. Since we'd already given up on counting calories decided to finish off the evening with a brownie dessert. Oh my! Warm brownie with a smear of peanut butter & topped off with homemade ice cream. Perfect way to end the caloric insanity.",

Ingredients felt really fresh, size was decent for a higher end tapas-style plate. I usually have 3-4 and a glass of wine. My average check runs a little over $50 which is not bad considering the quality and the taste of their food. Any plate is a safe bet and if you are disappointed from one (which I never did) you'll end up having 2-3 more that will make up for it. Nice ambiance too.

It's a refreshing change from the other Montford restaurants in my opinion.  I have been several times and usually enjoy it overall. This is a fun place to try but probably not a place to keep in a more regular rotation.  For what you get it's just a bit overpriced (I know it's small plates but portions are really small even for small plates at those prices). It's also usually hard to get a spot without a wait and the bar area can get a bit packed with people waiting for tables and therefore fight for space.  The waitstaff and bartenders are seem to have a rather nonchalant demeanor versus a customer friendly attitude which I find a bit frustrating at times. It's worth giving it a try for sure though...",

We sat at the bar as we got there at 6 (they open at 530) and there was a 45 minute wait. The bar was first come first serve. We ordered a couple of cocktails and looked through the menu. We ended up spending $96 on 4 tapas style dishes and two cocktails. But not before the bartender came over and remarked \"Wow! Food seems to go quick over here!\" and a waitress coming by and said \"Here, let me give you two the bigger portion\" ...it was ridiculous. Also, we were there for 2 hours. We easily sat for 30 minutes between our last small plate, and another 30 for the bill. The bartender had an obvious disdain for us. I made a Yelp just to write a review because I've never been made to feel worse by staff. So the Good Food on Montford I used to sing praises of now starts with \"I was fat shamed, the food was alright though\"",

The bar is usually pretty crowded so sometimes it's hard to find a place to stand and wait. I highly recommend waiting though. It will be worth it. I love that this place is all small plates which means you can order a lot, share and try different things. Not the best place to go on a first date if you want to have a meaningful conversation since it's usually pretty loud. Great place though for people watching. I'm not usually a meat eater, and would never order pulled pork on my own but after the lovely steamed bun lured me in, I was hooked on the taste of the sweet, bbq pork inside. There is a hint of caramlization and crispiness that makes it all melt in your mouth. I also had the scallops the other night with warm peaches and grits. I'm not a fan of grits usually but these were really tasty. Makes me want to make them at home although I probably don't want to know how many calories it took to get them to taste that good! I love coming here and trying new items. I will be back, over and over again!! GOOD FOOD!",

But that's why you should trust me when I tell you - Good Food on Montford is delicious.  It gets very crowded.  They do not take reservations, which is kind of awesome because you just go when you want to go - just be prepared to wait. The decor is unpretentious - dim warm lights, some high tables in the bar area. Not too casual and not too dressy. Not too romantic, but still a little intimate. Honestly - a great date spot or a good place to go with family or friends.  The bar is large enough to comfortably eat at.  The drink menu had some interesting and delicious cocktails. I had a pomegrante grapefruit margarita and it was wonderful.  Then they brought a wine menu.  They encourage you to try the wine - and when you make up your mind, they do a seriously heavy pour - the kind of pour you wish restaurants always did - the pour you give yourself when you open a bottle of wine at home.  They serve this delicous crusty bread with virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar - the olive oil has a fresh and distinct delicious taste of real virgin olive oil - they invest in the good stuff.  The menu doesn't cater to one particular type of cuisine. They have such breadth and depth in their menu - whether its pasta dishes, lamb belly, pomme frites with truffle oil and parmesan or my absolute favorite - the pork bun.  Everything was exectuted perfectly.  The pasta dish was a tad bit salty, but still delicious. It is a great place to go to share so you can try more than one thing on the menu.  We did not have dessert - we were too full.  but every single thing we ordered was fabulous.  It isn't inexpensive, but you feel you got what you paid for when you leave.  A completely wonderful dining experience.  I will go here again and again.",

Seating host says that we don't rush anyone who is finished with their dinner. Not even a table of 6 and 2 of the people left and the other 4 were sitting and talking, with their to go bags on the table.  Meanwhile 2 other groups of 4 left because it took so long..host did pick up our bar tab (2 drinks) but we left because management doesn't have control over their restaurant and obviously were not concerned about us who had been waiting over 2 hours. ..now will not go back and will be sure to let everyone know about our  experience. ..yes we did go to Braswells to have drinks, so they are happy about Good Food's crowd control problem and now Georges Brasiere even happier we came to them for dinner and an excellent meal. (By the way..read review from 5/9/14...had a problem with the seating host as well.)",

Some favorites of mine are the Green Curry Mussels (a fairly large portion for a tapas dish), the gnocci & the pea soup with crispy shallots (to DIE FOR).  The seating is somewhat small and there is a decent wait but that just goes to show how much people like it! The bar is always packed but it usually only takes a minute or two before getting a drink while you wait for a table.  There is also an outside deck out front to sit and wait for your table if the weather calls for it.  It is definitely a great restaurant to try out especially with a few friends that like to experiment with different styles of food.  Two thumbs way up!",

    "text": "Sorry to do this but I have to down grade my earlier review.  The food here is still outstanding,  but there was very questionable behavior by the seating host. Since this amazing restaurant only takes walk ins it really matters when you don't honor the wait list and we watched it happen.  We were waiting for a table by the host station when someone he knew came in. The couple 2 minutes before her got told  there would be a 30-45 minutes wait. He put her name on the list. We were just getting dessert and asked to be seated at the bar and waited 30 minutes too, which was fine. His friend sat down next to us with the restaurant still packed and a few minutes later was seated. There where several other parties still on the seating list. To me that's a big no no. I like this restaurant a lot, but there are so many great places that do take reservations in town and the clientele seems to be dressed to the nines lately.  So will I get seated faster if I dress better or no someone? It's very hard to get in and out of the parking and no I have to wear a dress and my husband has to wear a bow tie to get the hosts attention?  I might as well go to Barringtons. I miss the old Good Food. :(",

We tried the farmhouse cheese plate (delicious, but small), gnocchi, steamed bun, pork carnitas, and cinnamon bun cobbler for dessert.  We were truly impressed by the gnocchi and pork carnitas, the flavor was outstanding.  The steamed bun was good, but we both felt that it could use a more even coating of sauce for every bite.  Cinnamon bun cobbler was beautiful and quite tasty.  I would definitely come back.  However, be prepared to wait for a table on a weekend and spend a good amount of money on small-portion tapas.",

So, be prepared if you are one of those people that love to graze and order everything your heart desires!  Tonight I tried the pork bun and it was delicious.  I sometimes get hooked on an item in a restaurant and this is one of those times.  The pork bun was dripping with natural juices from the pork and hoisin sauce and then you would get a crisp bite from pickled veggies.  It was served on a cute little square cutting board, I would lift the cutting board to my mouth so it wouldn't drip down my chin.  YUMMY! One complaint is they do not do separate checks, which in this day and time with computers, it's so much easier.  If you haven't been to GFOM, strap your wallet on and go have a great meal!",

We added the garganeli, shrimp and andouille, and the mussels after.  My favorite by far was the seared scallops, my only regret was that we only had 1 order of these. Seared to perfection, juicy with flavors bursting out at every bite.   I highly recommend checking this restaurant out, the prices aren't too crazy but if you want to try the best items don't expect to walk away without spending at least $30-40 a person.",

Good Food is very popular and the reviews are great for the most part but I just don't see it. The food is okay I guess but the menu is very limited. That's not even it though. I can find something that I like to eat pretty much anywhere. So, we like to sit at the bar as opposed to a private table. The regular bartender has been there a very long time and I have had multiple encounters with him. I am not sure how to accurately describe him but in my experience he is surly and acts like he is irritated and annoyed every time I've been here. I tip well and do not think that I am too high maintenance but he comes across like he is doing me a \"favor\"to even wait on me. As someone that patrons restaurants all the time, I quite frankly feel uncomfortable here. We received a gift card to Good Food this past Christmas and I was disappointed that it was not for a place that I actually want to go back to. People go out and spend their money to have a nice meal, good drinks and enjoy a welcoming and inviting atmosphere and sadly this is not the place. In fact, we still have money left on our gift card but will not be going back here. This is unfortunate because Montford could benefit from a place that is more upscale from the typical bars. This is not the place.",

Everything on the menu sounded good and was very reasonably priced, but we limited ourselves to 1. delicious cheese plate with munster, chevre, and blue accompanied by fig paste, chutney, and local honey,  2. perfectly seared scallops over sweet potato risotto, 3. homemade pasta with divine tomato sauce and homemade chorizo.    Three dishes to share were the perfect amount for two normal sized people.    Great ambiance, service, prices, food, and beer on tap.  We will be back.",

There are subtle hints of truffle oil throughout the accompaniments of various jams, which is right up my alley.  The mussels have changed my life for the better. Even my non-coconutty mother raved over the green curry and coconut milk broth.    The highlight of my meal still has to be the duck fettuccine.  So creamy and delicious.  I could eat it every night!    Good Food is worth the price for a special night out when you really want to experience inspired and delicious cuisine!",

Food - Everything was flavorful and well balanced as far as flavor and texture.  There was a nice variety as well.  My only complaint was the portion for the price.  I get it, it's tapas but when I spend $100 for my wife and I, I don't want to have to get some food later, which I did. Service - Very attentive.  I noticed all the servers in the place were taking great care of their tables and the food runners were on their game.  I saw someone drop a dish and they had it replaced within 5 minutes...nice! Atmosphere - Nice decor, lighting etc.  We didn't mind waiting because we made some friends on the beautiful patio.  You can tell its an old building but the refit was excellent.  It is extremely clean and well maintained.  WE WILL BE BACK!!",

Off an interesting side street, Good Food matches its name with a nice atmosphere, dressy casual approach, decently long bar, and good crowd.  The wait was about 15-20 minutes for two on a saturday night, but the 100 degree heat may have kept some away.  Positives include comp. tasting of a new lebanese wine (which we then avoided...but you never know), steamed bun, corn risotto, and pommes frites.  The gnocchi had a great texture and good flavor.  The service was pleasant and informative, except for the end when she was a little grabby with the check once I had signed it.  The only negative was that our order of haricot verts came about 15 minutes after our first plate.  I know that some delivery spread comes with eating tapas, but to get a lighter dish that late on in the meal for two people was a little disappointing.  Interesting wine list with lots of international options, but all reasonably priced.  Very solid place and well worth checking out.",

Our server Paige had all the right ingredients to make our experience amazing, including but not limited to thoughtful menu suggestions, background info on the restaurant and the family that runs it, and an authentic and easy-going personality. We loved her.   Despite hearing reports of long waits for a table, we ended up being seated within 15 minutes. Luck? Perhaps. It was only Wednesday... But the place was full at 7:30pm!   Virtually everyone suggested the mussels, so of course we ordered them. Honestly? The green curry sauce that these perfectly cared-for mussels are swimming in, is one of the best things we have ever tasted. Seriously. Order them.  We got the pomme frites, also amazing, topped off by the suggestion from Paige to dip these crispy delights into the green curry sauce!!! Trust. Do it.   Next came the steamed bun, which according to my dining partner, is a play on the traditional Korean steamed buns. Rather than being a closed up bun with all the ingredients closed inside, the bun is folded over the sinful pork belly. Simply incredible. Texture, flavor... Wow.   We ordered the Brussel sprouts. Again, perfection. So much deliciousness.   Lastly, the garganelli. Literally tears came to my eyes at the first bite. Between the perfectly cooked pasta, the impeccably spiced sausage, and the sauce that tied it all together... It was sensory overload. I will dream of this dish.   The care and passion of the chef, staff and owners comes through in the vibe, the decor, the interactions between servers/staff, and most importantly... The Good Food. Highly recommend.",

Seriously, this place is FANCY and DELISH.  We shared a cheese plate that came with 3 kinds of cheese as well as honeycomb with honey, fig, a kind of pepper jam and seasoned bread. I can't tell you much about the cheese because I'm not an expert but every bite was illuminating.  Also tried their Korean BBQ wrap with some kind of tangy slaw - muy bueno! Warm, flavorful and well spiced, the only negative was that I ordered just one.  The only negative I can see here is that it's so expensive, I wouldn't be able to go much, and the serving sizes focus more on taste than quantity, so for those wanting a lot of food, prepare to order many items.",

But, it's fun to grab a drink at the bar - and perhaps a cheese plate - to whet the appetite. Who knows, you may end up sitting next to Hugh McColl, as he often comes in for a bite at the bar.  The menu changes every now and then, but my faves include the mushrooms, gnochetti (not on the menu right now), amazing Prince Edward Island mussels (with green curry, coconut milk and cilantro), steamed bun and lamb tagine. I love finishing the meal with a Hot Chocolate cocktail - hot means it has a kick, not a warm temperature! The wine list is short, but thoughtful.  There's been some service turnover, which was noticeable during my last visit, but hopefully that works itself out. In general, Good Food on Montford has consistently awesome food and service.",

I enjoyed both of these dishes.  I had the Confit Lamb Belly which was very good but when they say small plates they really mean small plates.  My girlfriend ordered a pasta she enjoyed also.  Overall, we both enjoyed this place and would recommend to anyone looking for a quality dinner in Charlotte.",

However, I didn't experience this restaurant alone; I was with my gluten/dairy-free (and practically vegetarian) wife.  There was NOTHING on the menu for her to eat.  When we spoke to the wait-staff about our predicament and requested something very simple (e.g., sauteed vegetables or something like that), the persons response was...sorry but, no.  So, I'm giving this restaurant a lower rating solely on the fact that I believe a \"gourmet\" place like this should be able to accommodate simple requests.  To make matters worse, the wait-person actually said to us, that next time we come, we should call ahead (around 2 or 3pm) and mention our needs to the chef.  Yeah....right.  By the way, I had the pork tenderloin with polenta.  Superb is an understatement.",

I also live a 5 minute walk from it so finally, one Saturday night, we came in for dinner. We didn't have to wait too long so we grabbed a drink at the bar. It took a little bit of time to get served and when I asked for a wine recommendation, the bartender didn't have much to say and seemed rushed. The wine I got was fine but nothing special. We were sat at our table, which was a nice booth table near the front. It took a bit of time for our server to come by, but he was nice enough.  We had the falafel, charcuterie plate, pork bun, curry mussels, and gnocchi with lemon and bacon. The falafel was very flavorful and was hot and crispy. The meat plate had a nice assortment, and the pork bun was cooked nicely and was a great size to share. The green curry mussels were very good, and had some tasty bread on top. The gnocchi was probably my favorite, it had a lemon cream on top that we stirred into the rest of the dish and it was rich and decadent. We finished off with the brownie sundae, which was good but not too memorable.   We really did have a nice time at Good Food, I thought the food was very good, but not as great as everyone hyped it up to be. I think the \"just ok\" service took away from the experience a little bit. We kind of felt like an afterthought. That being said I'll definitely come back to try more dishes.",

You wont find anything else like it anywhere. Very original recipe, highly recommend this one! Keep in mind, all the food here is tapas style so it will be smaller. Drinks were good too. I think Soul Gastrolounge has better drinks but this place comes close. The food alone merits 5 stars.   2. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. She didn't check on us too much or make sure we needed anything else, so I wasn't BLOWN AWAY by the service. The service alone merits 4 stars.   3. Plan ahead. This place usually has long wait times,  your best bet is to put yourself on the waiting list using Yelp (this was such a big help to my group of 4)... if you just show up be prepared to wait AT LEAST 1 hour.   4. Environment and ambiance: It isn't super upscale and dressy.... but ladies? I'd recommend some heels and jeans and a nice shirt. Dresses are always valid too. And men? I will say a collared shirt and some shoes will work.... this isn't a place I would come to dressed super urban or casual. The crowd is grown and classy. Match the vibes people.

There's the parking situation (good luck!), the tight seating arrangements (hi, join my wife and I in our conversation), and the no reservations policy (helloooo early bird)...

The menu rotates with the seasons, with the usual favorites remaining (do NOT skip the mussels or pomme frittes).  There is always a nice wine list.  Cocktails are delicious, but the prices are a bit inflated.  In fairness, aren't all cocktails overpriced now?   When my wife and I get out of the house, which isn't often, we usually dine here because it's our favorite place.  We always order the pomme frittes and mussels (use the fries to soak up that delicious left over broth) and then mix in some new items.  Although we've become quite the fan of the gnocci dishes.  Each time we've visited, it's a different dish, but the gnocci are so tender and melt in your mouth.   Some people don't like sitting at the chef/dessert bar, but my wife and I enjoy it.  It's that rare occasion where we can sit next to each.   Yes, it's a bit cramped inside and it gets really busy especially on weekends.

Just wish they would have more options for some of us who want to eat gluten free. But that's not surprising- Charlotte hasn't really been a place that offers much of that anyway.  So good job overall.",

Before I go on I just wanted to mention that I read a lot of reviews complaining about them not splitting checks.......it's written on their menu that they don't split checks!!! Maybe they added it after a lot of people complained? But yes it's there so don't be offended if they refuse to! The sauteed mushrooms are delicious, add some lemon and it will take it up a notch! The shrimp was good, nicely spiced. The naan went well with the lentils but not with the shrimp. The Korean beef was delicious! For dessert we had the brownie with biscoff ice cream which was oh so good!!",

The food was closer to five stars, but the service brought it down to four stars. Our food came out before our bottle of wine (really?) and we had to wait awhile to order as well.  For the food, the gnocchi was easily our favorite dish...at least until we got to dessert (more on that in a bit). I was also impressed by their cheese plate, one of our favorite orders on any menu. Each cheese came paired with some sort of spread and bread. Really outstanding pairings that I wouldn't have put together on my own! The Goose also really enjoyed his steamed bun, which is his standard for a good restaurant.  Normally I'm too full for dessert, but it is worth saving room at Good Food. Honestly, all of the desserts sounded delicious, but we were both in love with the brownie with biscoff ice cream that we ordered. They make the biscoff ice cream in-house, and the pairing with the warm, soft brownie was amazing. I'm really glad we tried it out!",

We each ordered a few items to try - I had the pasta (okay but not the best I've had), fries (overrated, in my opinion) and the steam bun (delicious!).   The service was terrible. Our waitress was the manager and she was super short when we asked questions. When the bill came, she didn't split it and said she wanted us to calculate how much to charge each card if we wanted it split up. Huh? So I wrote down what items to charge on each card and when I handed it to her, she was clearly irritated. When she brought it back to the table, she said \"Normally we don't do this so if you ask next time and we are busy, we will say no\".   While the food had some high notes, the service overall left a bad impression (although I will say, the other employees who brought our food or refilled our drinks were nice). I don't see myself coming back.",

Me and Baldie were trying to decide on where to go for my birthday dinner and originally it was Cafe Monte but because he's difficult and a stubborn Guinea and doesn't like shit outside of meat and potatoes for the most part,  I picked four other places to try and all four were booked except this place. I'm so glad they were all booked. This place was small and unassuming and had a kind of hipster feel. Small bar great bartender and my drink was Delish. We ordered carpaccio and arugula salad to start. Mind you it was delicious. However,  the other ingredients used, overpowered and totally obliterated the taste of the thinly sliced beef. A southern twist on this dish didn't work. It's to delicate for pimento cheese and fried pickles. Arugula salad was pretty basic, but good.  Pomme frites with truffle and Parmesan never disappoints. I was surprised to see just one pork bellysteamed bun come out, so we split it. Pork belly on it had good flavor, but a little chewy, but the slaw was awesome and had a nice crunch. The pasta dish had a decent portion and it's made with homemade sausage which was delicious, nicely seasoned and garlicky like I'm used to. It had sliced garlic that was really aromatic and Parmesan topped it off. BUT, it was SO SALTY. Wow, I love salt, but this was too much. It's a shame, tho. Because it was THAT good.  Dessert was cannoli cheesecake. It was good, that's all. We were really looking forward to the cinnamon roll apple dessert with ice cream on top. The cinnamon roll was so hard we couldn't get through it with our spoon and no one was to be found in order to get a fork and a knife  which was required to get through this hard piece of pastry.  I found the apples to be a little chewy and I was disappointed in that. Overall, I will say the food was good and I will definitely be back for drinks and apps another time.",

All he had to do was be a gentleman and tell us it would be just a few more minutes in a kind tone of voice. We totally understand everyone has a bad day every now and then, but this was the second time we have encountered this host. I am not sure why he works in the restaurant industry because he clearly does not enjoy his job.   Needless to say, we will not be back to Good Food.

I also love the simplicity of the name of the restaurant -- it takes balls to have \"Good Food\" in your restaurant name.  The steamed bun came first (within 5 minutes of ordering) and what really set this apart was the crust on the pork belly.  On part of the pork, it was slightly tougher to chew than I thought it would be but overall I really enjoyed the crust and the tenderness.  The garganelli was also excellent and it's also fun to say and I kept silently doing a Gargamel laugh (a villain from the Smurfs cartoon) as I was eating it because it was so good.  The ingredients here just worked together and the house-made italian sausage was so flavorful.    My only regret was that I wish my wife could have been here to enjoy these dishes with me, but alas I was here in Charlotte on a business trip.",

These tapas are tiny. Think $10- $11 for pork carnitas (tacos)...and the plate is two tiny corn tortillas with some pork. Eeeesh. The best part of the meal was the cheese plate and the carnitas (flavor wise). Also got trout which was good but nothing special, and the fried chicken which was so overwhelmed by an incredibly salty topping (sweet potato maybe?) that it was nearly inedible. I was so excited to try this place and I'm glad I did, but I wish we had spent the $100 elsewhere.",

Our group of three ordered: Pommes Frites - I'm a fries junkie, so had to get this. It was a nice snack before our main dishes came out Parmesan Gnocchi - my friends love this. I'm not into cheesy foods so I passed on this dish Steamed Bun - probably my favorite out of everything. This is a must. Pork Carnitas - Surprisingly good. Kind of have an Asian twist to it with the pickled veggies  Tega Hills Green - nice light salad Beer Battered Broccoli - again, not a fan of cheesy dishes so I skipped on this dish as well, but friends enjoyed it.  Definitely had better tapas in my hood of Atlanta and other bigger cities. I think the culinary scene is still growing in Charlotte, so until then GF will have to do.  Our group came around 6pm on a Friday night and waited about 20 min for a table. The dining space is small so come early if you prefer little to no wait as it gets filled very quickly.",

This can be a problem for some considering you don't get a ton of food for the price that you pay.  This being said, the quality of the food you get is incredible and you can easily get full from 2-3 tapas.  It's an amazing experience with plenty of unique and creative dishes full of taste.  Try the Korean Beef, the carpaccio, and the steamed pork belly bun to be sure (they were my favorites).  I would return in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "Ok, I guess a place like this works in Charlotte. I am between a 3 and 4 star for this place. I have been waiting for a LOOONG time to give the place a try, and just to show you how long I have been waiting for the occasion, I came on a Sunday, they were closed. I came after 10 one night on Friday they were closed. I live close to the south park area and have drove by the restaurant many other times. Last night though, I finally made it here.  I have several problems with this place. Space wise, it just isn't really enough to accomodate the customers. At first I thought this would be a romantic kind of upscale dining option with delicious food. WRONG. The place was SOO loud I could not even have a conversation with the person I was with who sits only ummm..10 inch from me?   Problem number 2. Our waiter(pale, heavy white male) was being pretty impatient with us. For an upscale dining experience, this is really not good. And he was pretty monotone and seemed bored trying to explain the fish of the day to us...  Problem number 3. Waiter was being pushy, for ordering more and for getting in and out of there quick. Well I guess maybe they just simply is having a space issue.   The parking. The parking lot is small, you will have a problem finding a spot. But the worse is, there is NOO way for my friend to back out, he had to reverse ALL the way out in order to drive out...the scariest parking experience ever. And my friend's car is pretty compact....This parking lot sounds like an accident bound to happen. The dumpster takes up half of the spot beside us so the lady could only park her car half way in...I wonder who's responsibility it would be if her car is accidentally damaged?  The food. It's definitely above average. Was it life changing? No. The portions are wayy too small for the price. Literally my friend was even like,\" ohh, is that it to the dish?\" For the price I paid I feel like I could have gotten more food and a less hectic experience at a better place.   The food did roll out pretty fast. But then again...it's not like we are ordering home made pizza or something that would take a while to cook.   The guy at the front who works as a hostess was awesome. The other person in my party had arrived before me. When I showed up, the hostess asked me if I was meeting a friend, I said yes and he answered \"I know exactly where he is and showed me the way\". On our way out, he also bid us farewell and wished us a nice night.   Decoration is pretty rusty modern. They cover each table with the paper tablecloth with the restaurant's name on it. Two glasses per person, one for water, another empty glass for wine. Every table gets complimentary sour dough bread paired with oil and balsamic vinegar and roasted garlic dip. The menu is just one side, not many options really...Make sure you are ok with that. This is like an upscale tapas place but a tad less fun. Oh, they also have a nice outdoor seating lounge area...but I don't suppose you'll want to have a meal out there, maybe a drink.   ONLY open for dinners Monday-Saturday. Come early or you'll have to wait.",

I was expecting flavors I haven't tried before but it was all the same to me.   The service was just okay. The people who came out to clean the tables and brung out the food had more interaction with the customers than the waiter/waitresses, which is a shame bc they get majority of the tips. The waiter was so focus on other things that he forgot about an order I placed. I had to ask about it 30 mins later into our meal where the dish was, I wish I hadn't cause it wasn't worth it. They can't split checks here, which is absurd. It doesn't make any sense! What is so hard to split checks and charge each individuals at the table for exactly what they ordered.   I tried the food once but I wouldn't go here again especially if you have to wait 30mins to an hour just to get seated. I rather get cheaper, better food down the street. Probably better service too.",

I loved the ambiance. We were with a party of eight and reservations are not excepted. So we went early and waited until they opened. Our table was set nicely and we had a great time. Everyone seemed to love all the dishes that they ordered. This is a small plate type of restaurant and after three plates my husband and I were both satiated.  The restaurant doesn't accept individual checks so only one is presented and you have to decide how it must be split up. That is the only negative about Good Food on Montford. I will be bringing out of town guests here often.",

We ended up waiting quite a while to get a table and was pushed back in line when a \"friend\" of the manager showed up (aka Nascar driver). We sat at the bar and enjoyed some great wine. The host and the manager were extremely apologetic about the wait and gave us drinks on the house.   When we were finally seated, we almost ordered the entire menu. There were 4 of us and we wanted to try as much as we could without duplicating plates. Some plates were def. larger than others. The two pasta dishes were great as well as the pork belly sandwich, and broccoli with cheese curds. There wasn't a bad plate to be had. Also, the manager gave us a few appetizers on the house for our wait.   Overall, great food, cool atmosphere, and a very attentive and graceful wait staff. Will definitely go back. Probably a little tight for a larger dinner party, good for a party of 4 or less.",

That's right, this place stands out among the crowded streets of CLT filled with corporate restaurant groups and chains.    What I like most is they are not afraid to be original with both the menu and the wine list... this is an independent restaurant at its best.  Been here 3 times and will be going back at least once a month or so.  I'd go back more often but I do like to torture myself by trying other sub-par places around town in the hopes that I'll come across a gem like this one.  First time I went, loved everything on the menu.  Each dish was just enough to give me a good taste, and each truly delivered.  Second time I brought a group of 6... I had to tell my friends \"trust me\" after one friend went to the website and was like \"dude where's my meat+2 entree\" and while I can't claim to have transformed them all into foodies (yet), everyone loved it.  Third time was a charm - yep, consistency was there, food quality - check, wine list - check, service - check, 5 stars - check.  I have a few more restaurants that I have not been to until my CLT tour is complete, but I imagine there will be no more than 5 or 6 places that get 5 stars.  I have high expectations because I don't think we should pay so much to dine out just to be underwhelmed.  Good Food will over deliver on all aspects.  Go there, now!",

    "text": "I've lived just down the road from Good Food for a couple years, yet had been deterred from dining there out of concern for the long wait times and inability to make reservation.  Well, after dining there this week, I'm regretting that I waited so long.  We arrived at 6:30pm on a Tuesday and were seated immediately.  The interior is cozy and well decorated with open views of the kitchen.    Roasted garlic cloves and balsamic vinegar were in small dishes on the table, and warm fresh bread was soon delivered.   The two of us shared five different tapas, which proved to be a good amount without leaving us uncomfortably full.  1. Arugula Salad: the combination of pears, goat cheese, pistachios, and balsamic maple dressing was an excellent start.  2. Mussels:  You get a large portion for the price and the thai curry seasoning is unique.  You'll want to ask for extra bread to soak up the indulgent sauce.  3. Lamb Cheek Pasta:  Oh my gosh!  The best dish of the night!  I read multiple reviews that stressed the incredibleness of the pasta, and they were spot on.  Rich, well seasoned, and the best bowl of pasta I've had in quite some time.  4. Crispy Quail Lettuce Wraps:  This was the only dish we ordered that I was not especially impressed with.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't all that special.  The quail was grilled, not crispy like I had imagined.  5. Sea Bass Special:  The crispy vegetable cake and fruit chutney were my favorite components on the plate.  The fish was just slightly dry.  $14 for a very small plate seemed a bit steep.  The menu is full over unique and delicious sounding small plates, and I'll definitely be back.   Given the size of the portions, I think it's best to share each plate between two people.  Trying to split things 3 ways would be tough.",

    "text": "Good Food stands True to their name.  All through my meal with four others, all we kept saying was, \"MMM!  This is so good!\"  I've been recommended by other Charlotteans to check this place out and decided it would be a great opportunity to go for dinner with some out-of-town guests.  The decor is super cute and welcoming and the host was just plain awesome.  He was funny and accommodating in a great, friendly way.  We were seated in no time, despite it being a busy Saturday night and proceeded to order 1-2 dishes per person and some yummy cocktails.  To some it up, their portions to me are just right (although probably small by other Southern standards), their cocktails are strong and their sauces are just plain delicious.  All of their pasta dishes were really tasty and would recommend if you're looking to just order 1 plate.  No doubt, I will be back there very soon.  Cheers to good, affordable food in Charlotte!",

They have a great wine selection and the service is top notch.  They don't take reservations so plan on coming close to open or hanging out for a bit to get your table.  The wait is totally worth it.  Parking is tight here as well.",

Little on the pricey side of $48 for one person but I ordered the chartruderie plate, Korean beef, glass of champagne and red velvet Twinkie. The chartruderie was average and didn't excite too much although it was delicious especially the foie gras with chutney but it lacked presentation. The Korean beef was out of this world!  Cooked to perfection, presented well and ate every last drop of it. The red velvet Twinkie was also different and well worth trying. Delicious and perfect for finishing the night with champagne",

I had the falafel - which was cripsy and warm and chewy on the inside, and well seasoned. The steamed bun was delicious. The pork belly was cooked well, there wasn' too much sauce or too much bun. It all complimented each other. Shrimp & Andouille was also very good. I'm a huge fan of garlic, so the hints of garlic with the creamy risotto really went well with the shrimp.",

    "text": "Good Food is a modest name for the culinary delights awaiting you. We ate at Good Food on Montford for the first time on a recent Saturday evening, arriving around 5:50 and were seated promptly at one of the last two-top tables (shortly after we arrived they started seating separate groups of 2 at one 6-top with a seat between.) We ordered a variety of small plates including the green curry mussels and truffle fries (thanks to previous reviews recommending this pairing), the steamed bun, quail lettuce wraps, shrimp arepas and parmesan gnocchi with pistachio pesto. Everything was perfect. It was obvious that every ingredient in every dish was perfectly thought out and expertly prepared. Even ingredients like beets which we typically avoid were transformed into something delicious. After all those plates you'd think we'd be too stuffed for dessert, but the chocolate brownie with cookie butter ice cream was beckoning me and was also delicious.  The restaurant is small, so as previous reviews have stated, you'll want to arrive shortly after opening. You're also sitting pretty close to your neighbors (especially along the right-side wall where we were seated - I know a little more than I'd like about our fellow diner's teenage children, and ended up with a little bit of wax on my foot when another diner knocked their candle off the table.) Arrive early, or you may be waiting or sitting at a 6 top with strangers. Because it is small plates and you order throughout the dining experience, I imagine it's hard for the hosts to provide an average wait time - you could technically sit there all night and keep ordering plate after plate (and you'll be tempted to!!)",

They also changed the entire dessert menu and the biscoff ice cream cone situation is on another level, we had a little fight at our table over sharing it.  So my advice, get two of them!!",

Most items $8-10 per plate, glass of wine starts at $9.  The service was good, a bit slow at times, but it was a very busy night last night. The main reason for my very low rating is that they do not split checks, and didn't tell us upfront.  This ended up being a nightmare for my group of 10 that left at certain times.  It was such a debacle, and you don't want to be the last person handing in the money, only to realize someone forget to add the tax on their amount.  It's so ridiculous that just about every restaurant in Charlotte will split checks with no issues, but not this one.",

I saw the yelp reviews and couldn't believe this place was that good. I was completely wrong. The inside of the place is so much more appealing than the outside.  Tapas style american cuisine is how I would describe this place. My friend and I asked the waitress what we should start with.  She told us the mussels were the best in Charlotte.  She wasn't far off.  Drenched in a nice smooth curry sauce the combination was unbeatable.  From there, I moved onto the scallops.  The scallops were pretty good, but the cous cous underneath was some of the best I had. Since the food was good and I'm fat I decided to order the pork tenderloin as well.  This portion was considerabley bigger and was just amazing.  The pork was cooked to perfection and the chorizo hash & chili demi really set this dish off.   I will be back and my friend has been telling me that he will be taking his girl here when she comes down.  Bottom line, looks are decieving and this place is a diamond in the rough.",

Besides the bread loaves, portions were very, very small compared to other tapas establishments I have frequented in the DC area. Realistically 4-6 tapas per person equates to a reasonable dinner, 1 or 3 for a snack assuming you are not filling yourself up with their nutritiously devoid bread / olive oil. Choosing not to implode on bread, we actually stopped for food on the way home. Auto gratuity for groups of 6+ is 20% of the post-tax total which I find questionable, there is no reason why I should be forced to tip on collected taxes. As a matter of principle, I always tip generously above and beyond even for reasonable service, more for great service but, please don't shove it down my throat. Asked the manager Brad about it who dismissed it as a new setting on their latest point of sale system, no interest in changing it.",

We were seated immediately and the first thing that we noticed was the overall atmosphere is great, the lighting was perfect, the restaurant is classy, but not too formal that you feel uncomfortable if you are not really dressed up and they play a nice mix of classic rock.  The menu had a great mix of choices and we started with salads, both were great with fresh, crisp greens. We also tried the Butternut Squash soup, AMAZING, what a great soup, we would go back just for that.  I had the Gnocchi, this dish was perfect, I could have eaten two more orders myself. the mushrooms were cooked perfectly and the broth was delicious.  Dessert was a very difficult choice, as there were many options to choose from. We decided on the cobbler and the cupcake. The cobbler was great, very nice crust and delicious filling. The cupcake was unreal, moist inside with a meringue topping that would make an old shoe taste great, I absolutely love this dessert.  The service was good, but I would have loved some more interaction from our server. As it was our first visit, we would have welcomed some advice on dishes and that little extra hospitality would really made the experience that much better.  She was efficient and the courses were timed extremely well, but she was pretty much an order taker who only stopped by occasionally and didn't really interact with us or make us feel at home.   I am looking forward to returning and am impressed with the food and atmosphere.",

Looked at the menu and noticed that all menu items looked like small plates. After confirming with the waitress/bartender we decided on three: the Gnocchi, Steamed Bun and the mussels. All three were very good. My wife loved the mussels and I loved the steamed bun.  Ordered one more pasta dish and it was good, although not as good as the other three.

When I first saw the $$$ rating here I was confused... the menu items range anywhere from 7-15... a price I would consider reasonable.  I ordered a beer, of which they have a respectable selection at common prices. I also ordered the parmesan gnocchi.  And then it happened....   my baby bowl of gnocchi arrived.  I am not letting the serving size alter my rating as it was PERFECT.  Yes there was less than 8 oz of gnocchi.... yes there was less than 1/3 of a chicken breast... but it was heavenly.  Still being hungry i was compelled to order a second plate, the steamed bun with pork belly and a Glenlivet 12 year neat for desert.    The steamed bun was also fantastic and of similar portion size to the first dish.  My one surprise at the end was the price of the scotch.  I was suspecting that a place with such a profit margin on their food would not feel the need to mark up their booze so much, but alas...  All in all, i would definitely come back.",

The Price Edward Island mussels in green curry, coconut milk & cilantro are one of my absolute favorites.  Dipping some of the dinner bread in the curry sauce is the way to go.  I could eat this everyday I think!  The braised lamb tagine with Moroccan spices & dried fruit is quite the treat as well.  It really doesn't sound that great but it's very tender and encompasses just the right amount of fruit and spices.    Can't wait to go back!",

Our party of ten tried over half the menu and  every dish was delightful.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and the grits with them tasty; the shrimp was a favorite and best of all the chipotle sauce with them wasn't too smoky tasting; the Korean beef was flavorful but a little too spicy for me. Others at the table thought it was divine.   The restaurant is small and a little noisy. It was perfect for a fun night out with friends. They don't take reservations so get there early. We went on a Saturday night. Our group of ten arrived at opening and others were also there waiting for the doors to open. The wait staff was wonderful, very attentive and knowledgable about the menu. The menu does change about every three months so you will never be bored.",

    "text": "Excellent, though potentially pricey.  Looks like the small plates craze is still going strong in Charlotte. This place is packed with ladies on a night out, but its good for anyone for a craving for delicious food.  We waltzed in on a Tuesday night at about 6pm - there was only about one other table of people. My coworkers joked that once again I had brought them to a place where no one else eats, but by the time we left, the place was just about packed.  Ambiance is good - a bit dark but we sat by the windows. Nice warm feeling.   We tried a bunch of dishes - our favorites were the much acclaimed pork bun, a big bowl of mussels in a green curry, and a fettucine dish. We also tried a charcuterie plate - the chicken liver pate was good but the meats were mediocre. I'm not sure if they make their own meats, if they do, they should look for a different supplier. Not horrible, just not interesting. Scallops over butternut squash risotto was good. I felt the dish was excellent but I guess its hard to make an interesting scallop dish. Pork tenderloin was juicy and had a nice smoky taste. The accompanying fried mac and cheese was tasty - its mac and cheese with a crunchy exterior. Once its on  the plate, its like any other mac and cheese.  No problem on the bread service - our waitress brought several rounds of bread for us to sop up the green curry sauce.  We ended with two deserts, a cobbler and a pear tart with avocado ice cream. The cobbler was traditional and delicious with vanilla ice cream. The tart was so so and the avocado ice cream was very avocadoish, which is I suppose a good thing.  I would have liked to have seen some lower priced wine, but the selection was interesting and we had a delicious bottle of pinot noir. The cocktails were also decently crafted.",

    "text": "Literally, one of the best meals I've had in Charlotte.  We went on a Friday night at 8pm, and since no reservations were accepted, there was quite a wait, FYI.  Given the quality of the food, it was well worth it.  I'll discuss the dishes we had, in descending order of \"Best\" to \"Still Very Good.\"   The star of the evening was the pork bun.  WOW!  The pork was seasoned impeccably, the bun was soft and fluffy and the garnishments were spot-on.  We ate it in silence, so that we could savor every bite without distraction.  Really, it was the best thing I have eaten in months.    The next best dish were the mussels. I couldn't get enough of the green curry sauce, and I agree with other reviewers who have complained about the lack of bread: with broth that good, two slices of pita won't cut it.  Baguettes for the broth, please!  Next, the Moroccan lamb dish.  Again, the seasoning was just spot-on.  The dish had wonderful spices (anise?) and fruit that all worked perfectly together.  If the other dishes hadn't been so good, I would have left the restaurant raving about this one.    Last place (but by no means bad) was the gnocchini.  Very good, just too rich for me.  If you like carbonara dishes, then this is for you.  My two cents, however, is that heavy cream-based dishes all kind of taste the same (i.e. quite delicious) everywhere, so it is worth your dollar and while to enjoy the other, more refined, dishes at a restaurant of this caliber.  So, GFOM gets my highest endorsement and will likely be my #1 recommendation for anyone visiting Charlotte.  I just wish there were more places like it.  Continue on.",

    "text": "Good Food on Montford... More like Awesome Food! The BF chose this spot for our date night. We arrived around 6:15 on a Saturday. We were informed the wait would be about 20 minutes. The host took our phone number and said that he would call us when a table was available. I prefer this to one of those buzzers that requires you stick around the place. It was a nice night and the wait wasn't bad so we sat down outside. He gave us a buzz and we walked inside. He informed us that there was seating at the Chef's table if we would like or we could wait for a table. I was starving at this point, so the Chef's table it was! We were taken to a roomy bar that overlooked the dessert/cold plate section of the kitchen. It's an awesome spot to chat with the chefs. Our server was attentive and the food rolled out at a good pace.   As for the food...  The bread was nothing to write home about but I loved the roasted garlic that came with it.   Pork Bun: The pork bun was phenomenal. Not a traditional steam bun set up but more like a little sandwich. The bun itself was made in house and a nice soft texture. The pork belly was perfectly tender and delectable. The sweetness of the hoisin sauce added a nice balance to the dish.   Scallops: The scallops were perfectly seasoned and seared. Two decent sized scallops sat atop a bed of Israeli couscous. The dish was very good but not life changing.   Quail Lettuce Wraps: Our favorite dish of the night! The quail was succulent. Just rich enough and the flavors were well developed. This was a nice light plate. So, so good.   Chocolate Brownie w/ Biscoff Ice Cream: Stellar... I mean it's a brownie but it was a damn good brownie. Warmed up and served on a plate with peanut butter, a scoop of homemade biscoff ice cream and a dollop of fresh whip cream. Amazing. Such a great way to end the meal.  I'm already looking forward to our next visit!",

My favorites on the asian side include deconstructed Korean short ribs on crispy rice, and the pork belly buns. Italian pastas are all excellent, distinct flavors, with beautiful home made noodles. Have never had a bad dish here.   However because they don't take reservations, and it's ridiculously packed all the time, I don't get there too often. Usually I go when I plan to eat dinner early (near 5) right when they open. Then I don't have to deal with crowd or line.  If you do have dinner early here, the place is child friendly.   Bottom line is the food is great, if a bit pricey. One of the restaurants that I feel comfortable taking out of town friends from New York or other big metropolitan areas to, and raising their expectations that they'll \"really like it\".",

    "text": "Get the mussels. Get the mussels. Get the mussels.  I love mussels and it's always about the sauce that they are cooked in. I love dipping bread into the garlic sauce. Good Food has done a great job of making their mussels unique with a coconut curry sauce. Not only did I ask for more bread to dip in it,  but if no one was around I would have drank what was left in the bowl.   Not a fan of  mussels the rest of their food was also great and the service even better. The foie gras & chicken liver mousse was the best I've had in Charlotte. However, I could have done without everything else it came with.   I'll definately be back in the near future.",

    "text": "On a recent visit to Charlotte to visit family I visited Good Food on Monford with my mother and grandmother.  We went based on my Mom's insistence since she had been on her last visit to this area and loved it.  After our dinner there, I definitely agree with her!  The restaurant looks odd and small from the outside, but is adorable on the inside with a beautiful bar.  Since they do not take reservations, we arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday and were seated immediately.  Our waitress was happy to explain the menu to us since this is a small plates restaurant and gave us some recommendations.    The wine servings are generous - they bring you a small carafe which is really two glasses of wine in one.    The food is definitely the stand out here.  They bring you fresh bread and there is roasted garlic and oil & balsamic on the table waiting for you - yum.  I ordered the mixed green salad and the Korean beef.  Both dishes were delicious.  My mother and grandmother really enjoyed their dishes as well.  I tried a bite of my mom's shrimp arepas and instantly got a case of food envy - delicious!  I justified only getting two small dishes as the reasoning behind ordering dessert.  My mom and I shared the malted cheesecake which was absolutely amazing.    My only complaint would really be the noise level in here.  I may have been more cognizant of the noise since we were with my grandmother, but it was hard to hear each other.  As more and more people started waiting for seats, they started to crowd our table since we were seated by the door.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in the area since I love small dish restaurants, and this one definitely delivered!",

Ok now grab your keys and head straight over to Good Food on Montford and order it!!!!! Go now and go quickly. I promise you will not regret it. This dish was by far one of the best pasta dishes I have ever tasted. The pasta was fresh, cooked al dente, the lamb cheeks melted in my mouth and the sauce was thick, rich and decadent. The dish was so good I ordered it twice. In fact I almost ordered it a third time until my husband quickly reminded me that we had 5 other dishes coming. Damn I hate when he interferes with my Epicurean encounters.    The other dishes were great but honestly the pasta dish was an out of body experience.  Next time I will forgo the salads and Falafel. The Salad was nothing special and unfortunately after being in the Middle East, I have become a Falafel snob.   The Korean Beef was great, the Steamed Bun with Pork Belly was good and the Scallops and Polenta was to die for. The scallops themselves were cooked to perfection.   My only gripe is the place is always crowded and rather loud but the good food usually drowns out the chatter.",

The preparation of each dish is creative and thoughtful. I love that the menu changes but the favorites stay. The mussels might be the best I've ever had. Having a lot of foodie friends in NY, picking something up to their standards when they visit can be stressful, but Good Food never lets me down!  The decor is simple but cozy, a kind of 70s chic chalet feel. My go to menu items are the mussels, the bun, any of the pastas and biscoff ice cream.",

Got there just after opening, good thing because soon it was filled up. I overheard the host tell other patrons that on sat nights they usually have a line out the door but Friday's aren't too bad. I sat at the bar that faces the cold prep area - the chef and waiters are super friendly and help you make decisions :). I hadn't eaten all day- had no trouble eating 3 plates - dessert after left me totally stuffed though! The food was wonderful, started with the citrus pear salad - lovely and not for sharing in my book! I had the Korean beef next because it was so raved about. Not totally my taste but I can see why people like it. So if you love Korean food you will love it and that plate is good for sharing. Next I ordered the gnocchi with roast duck, OMG loved it. Sublime. Definitely good for sharing as it is a rich dish, unless you have a big appetite that night like I did ha! Couldn't pass up dessert and coffee to wind down the meal. Had the cinnamon roll with homemade ice cream but almost ordered the brownie with brown butter vanilla. The chef must have heard me debating and gave me a scoop of the vanilla. Loved it more and would have that next time!  So yeah I ate for two and enjoyed the whole meal. Will definitely go back - a great date night or meet up with friends kind of place. Didn't feel awkward eating there alone though!",

The employees did everything correctly after the tree fell but it was just very surprising as my wife and my friends pregnant wife attempted to run and I attempted to catch the falling branch.  Beef Carpaccio: Very good, great balance with the acid. Pomme Frites: Excellent fries Braised Duck Fettucini: A  tad rich but quite tasty Crispy Quail Lettuce Wraps: The meat was a bit under(I prefer it this way but pregnant lady at the table) Steamed Bun: Great, can be a bit spicy in case you don't like that Confit Lamb Belly: Best bite of the evening the lentils were incredible. Korean Beef: The scallion Kim Chi is awesome  Fresh Catch: Monkfish over Oyster Stew The monkfish was great but the oyster stew only worked as a sauce.  The deserts were meager and I would recommend going elsewhere.",

It was only about 20 minutes this time around which is very reasonable for a Friday night during prime dinner hours.  The food was excellent, every thing was cooked perfectly and very well balanced from a flavor standpoint. Between the 4 of us we had the pomme frittes (X2), cheese plate, pork tenderloin, salmon, steamed bun, Arugula, falafel and the shrimp. We also did one dessert per couple. Service was good as well.  Advice for people with more robust appetites: Go get a smoothie or something an hour or two before dinner or you might still be hungry after wards. That's what I plan to do if we go back. We weren't seated until about 8PM and I hadn't eaten since about 1PM. I was pretty hungry by that time and even after the amount of plates we ordered myself and the other guy wanted to go grab a burger or something afterward.",

Like royalty in the Middle Ages, tax the \"peasants\" around your table. The ends shall justify the means. For this is Tapas on a whole new level with wonderful presentation and unusual takes on classic and not-so-classic dishes.  I have yet to find a dish here I would not \"tax\" again.

Now, I understand their concept, BUT, the 2 guys next to us ( who came in after us) got all their dishes delivered within about 20 minutes.

Started off with the Elderflower Pear Fizz - delicious! This place serves food tapas style which are small plates, similar to Dim Sum. If you're not into sharing, don't come here. Fortunately I came with my sister and cousin - double dipping is not a problem for us. We ordered several plates to share and loved them all except the gnocchi. The best gnocchi I've ever had was at Aria uptown and that just can't be beat. The pork belly bao bun was sweet and savory, topped with pickled carrots and daikon to offset the sweetness. I usually see the bao bun served with julienned cucumbers but the pickles were a delightful change. The pomme frites stayed crispy, even after sitting at the table for several minutes. We dipped them into the green curry sauce served with mussels. So yummy!!! We also had pasta with sausage and marinara sauce and Korean beef on crispy rice. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the Korean beef was so tender and moist. The sauce on both dishes were seasoned perfectly. We ended the meal with the cobbler which was more tart than I expected but the ice cream made up for it. Overall a great dining experience. The food was great, wait staff was even better. Even though we waited a while for a table, the food came out super fast. Can't wait to go back for more.",

I went with a date on a Friday night and anticipated a healthy wait time, but we were seated quickly at a high-top table that provided a great view of the bar and the rest of the restaurant. I asked for an allergen-friendly menu and was pleasantly surprised that the layout had been reworked since my last visit; the new design is much easier to decipher and clearly determine which items adhere to your particular dietary restriction.  We ordered a handful of small plates that were all marked as gluten-free, including the charcuterie, mussels, poached egg, and risotto. Everything was wonderful; the presentation was perfect and the flavors were top-notch. Our server brought me a plate of GF crackers for me to enjoy the chicken liver mousse from our charcuterie board, too, without me asking. It was a very thoughtful gesture.  Even though the place was packed, everything we ordered came out in a reasonable amount of time and we ended up with a few minutes to spare before heading over to Park Terrace for a movie.  The only negative I could come up with for Good Food is that the tables are a little small. If you're ordering tapas, the real estate of the table gets filled up quickly and diners are often left to perform some strange sort of Tetris to make everything accessible to everyone eating.  Good Food is absolutely worth visiting. The dishes are delightful and the service is marvelous.",

    "text": "Met a friend here for dinner...both being out of towners, we were up for sharing so that we could try more. Just a little shy of 5 stars, but so close. I'll start with the few downsides: the tables are a little cramped, which gives the impression that people nearby could listen in, and the parking lot was very cramped and does not have nearly enough spaces to accommodate everyone inside when all tables are seated. On a cold, rainy night, this was a little frustrating. Oh, and you know how people usually complain that restaurants are too cold? I don't know how the staff was still alive in this place: the heat was cranking!  But then the food and service made up for it. The purple sweet potato and apple gratin was delicious! Almost anything is good with herbed goat cheese, but this sweet/salty combo hit all the right flavors. The truffle fries were...truffle fries. The fries were cooked very well. Truffle is not my thing and the parmesan on these was a little much, but the cook on the fries was perfect! I thought the taco dish we got could have been a little better, but it was solid. And the favorite: udon. Wow. Delicious. We finished every drop and sort of fought (nicely) over the last serving in the bowl.   The desserts we didn't share, which is fine. I got the pot de creme and it was a little bowl of chocolate heaven. Imagine fancy, fancy pudding. Not too sweet, perfectly chocolate. And the waiter even iced down a coffee for me, which I thought was very nice. Basically, any time you ask for something not on the menu and they come up with a creative way to accommodate you, it's special!  All that and just $60 to split...not bad at all!",

    "text": "we came on a Friday and everything was pretty good. my favorite dish was the gnocchi. we had one issue where our scallops took a LONG time and were cooked improperly (basically raw on one side). disappointing as they were 2 scallops for $15, but we ate them anyways because they had taken so long and we were ready to wrap up our meal. our server asked how everything was at the end of the meal, so I told her about the scallops, but that we had eaten them, just wanted to give feedback, and she took them off the bill (was definitely not expecting that since we ate them).  It really meant a lot that they were taken off and I will always give my business to places that value their customers. I will return. also our server was pleasant and service was a tad slow but they were slammed so it was completely understandable.",

Our bartender was great, very knowledgeable about the food and wine, and provided great service. The food was good. We had the beef carpaccio, steamed bun, and Korean noodles (which I probably wouldn't order again). But spring for dessert at this spot. The brownie tasted amazing and everything looked fabulous! It is a tapas style joint so prepare to share. I recommend ordering as you go, rather than ordering all at once so you can relax, enjoy yourself, and judge how hungry you are. Definitely check this place out!",

We've eaten here no less than 10 times (it's Tuesday, let's celebrate! I had a good day, let's go to Good Food! Lol any reason is a good reason), and EVERY experience has been incredible. Recently, I had some beef carpaccio that was so good I literally had dreams about it. I made my husband go back with me several days later and ordered two just for myself....seriously, it was that good. Even the drinks are usually very good! It's a perfect date night spot and a good place to hang out with friends. Just be warned: if you think you're gonna show up here at 7pm on a Saturday night, then be prepared to eat your arm off while you wait about 2hrs for a table. Be smart, go early, or go on a weeknight.",

My wife and I eat a vegan diet and went here because Yelp tagged it as a vegan spot. Once we reviewed the menu and talked with the waitress, we realized that it was not set up for vegan options. The waitress took it upon herself to learn what we were looking for and go back and consult with the chef to see what they could do. To our pleasant surprise, the chef himself came out and talked with us to get an understanding of what could work for both of us. He whipped up some amazing impromptu dishes and said he would be happy to prepare something next time we come in, just give him a heads up. First class experience, and we will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Pro tip: Sit in the back bar!! *Person in back of crowd screams* \"There's seating in the back? I thought it was just cramped tables??\"  Yes. There is seating in the back. And it's spacious, intimate, and wonderful, and on a weekday, it means you can probably skip the wait 100%. And now you know.  The Lady and I went out for a nicer dinner, put our name on the list, and was told about 25-30 minutes, if that. And guys, that was fine with us. We tried to find a place at the bar where we could squeeze in and order a drink, and lo and behold there were 2 seats for us in the back. Score. Plus, that station is the dessert station, so you get to see the dessert prep throughout your meal. You know, if you're into that sort of thing.  Drinks: Wine for the Lady and Dark n' Stormy for myself. Food:  Parmesan Gnocchi. Fantastic flavor, super rich, good consistency for the gnocchi. Loved the mushrooms in it. Battered Broccoli: Wish that there was more salt, I suppose the vinegar in the jalepenos was supposed to provide that, but I didn't get that in a majority of bites. Solid flavors though, just lacked a bit of seasoning.  Steamed Bun: This is what I came for. Awesome. Much satisfaction. Go get one now.  Shrimp: These were surprisingly stellar!! I actually asked the chef about the cooking method for these and got a mini recipe, so I'm very thankful that they were willing to share that. The combination of the apple, sweet potato, and shrimp together made a fantastic dish that I want to try to replicate.   Great night. Great restaurant. And I feel it's a bit underwhelming to say that it's just *Good* Food. Yelp, it's GREAT food.",

    "text": "For those who don't want to take the time to read my full review: ORDER THE MUSSELS!! The green curry sauce is the stuff made of dreams.   Visited on a recent Thursday evening (1-3-19) and had a great experience. According to our waiter, we got lucky because we came on a 'quiet' night since there was absolutely no wait when we arrived which was close to 7 p.m. and is quite rare for them.  Because of this particular location, we chose to uber, but they do have a small designated parking lot. Upon arrival, we were immediately seated and our excellent waiter, Jonathan, took our drink orders and got us bread. I ordered a blood orange mule and was pleased with my choice. I will say, I wasn't that impressed with the bread. It was a little dry to me but it comes served with an olive oil dip.   For starters, we got the pommes frites and steam bun. The steam bun came out first and is the most-ordered and talked about menu item. The pork belly is very flavorful and the bun is light and airy. Then came the pommes frites (fries) which were crispy and seasoned just right. Followed by the calamari which were dressed in a sweet mayo sauce and fried just right. Bonus that the calamari was not served with the filler tails and such as done at other restaurants. Then came my absolute favorite of the night: THE MUSSELS. They were served with two slices of pita. If I were given a straw, I would have slurped up the green sauce. SO GOOD. MUST ORDER.  We completed our meal with an order of scallops which were buttery and practically melted in my mouth. We were stuffed, however, our awesome waiter said there was a kitchen mix up and brought us a serving of the lamb gnocchi. I am not a lamb fan but the gnocchi was delicious and the lamb tasted more like stewed beef. No worries of the typical lamb gaminess found in this dish.  Good Food on Montford is blatant about what they provide: GOOD FOOD. Seriously, I doubt you'll be disappointed with anything you order here.",

It looks more like a small doctors office from out front rather than a restaurant.   We ended up ordering the pan seared scallops, sauted mushrooms, PEI mussels, and steamed bun. My girlfriend and I enjoyed all the items we ordered, but my favorites were the mussels and scallops. There were more dishes I wanted to try but we were both full from an earlier meal.

Why not 5 stars you ask, unfortunately service can be hit or miss and depending on the time of night it is definitely loud, making it difficult to enjoy conversations at your table.  But, let's get back to the good things.  Good Food is located on Montford Ave with a great location and beautiful restaurant.  It is intimate and is a great spot for date nights or a girls night out.   The menu includes several tapas items and can change seasonly.  However, there are a few items that have been on the menu since opening because they are so good.   A few standout items for me are the Garganelli Pasta with Sausage, the Carpaccio and the Korean Beef with Crispy Rice...love the Rice. And, definitely save room for dessert. They have some great treats that definitely deserve a taste. They have a great wine list and offer several speciality cocktails. If you haven't been to Good Food, I suggest you bookmark it for a special night.  But, keep in mind they do not take reservations, so enjoy a cocktail or two while you wait.",

    "text": "Ok, WOW the name of this restaurant is an understatement. I came into this place with high expectations after reading the crazy high yelp reviews. I've had this place bookmarked for the longest time and finally made it here 2 years later. Well, the first time I came here on a Sat night they told us a 2 hour wait. My family and I were pretty hungry and decided it wasn't worth the wait. So a few weeks later we came back on a thursday, intrigued by how popular it was, and got to choose our table.  I'm not sure if I would recommend coming here hungry or just peckish. The food is so good and the portions are so small that I could easily eat everything on the menu. Unfortunately, each dish is around $10-14 and our server recommended 2-3 dishes per person. If the food was less expensive I would definitely come here more often, but for now, i'll stick to special occasions.   It is a tapas-style restaurant, so each person gets their own small plate and the dishes are shared amongst everyone. I'm sort of vegetarian (more like pescatarian) but I tried a little of the pork belly and the korean beef (2 of the most popular dishes) and they were both really really delicious. Super flavorful sauces and textures. The falafel, and the other vegetable dishes are probably the best value and also are not lacking in flavor at all. The scallops were perfectly cooked. I would definitely recommend ordering a few pasta dishes because they are the most substantial/filling.   Not only does this place have good food, but fantastic service as well. Our server was genuinely friendly and offered lots of tips on what to order since it was our first time. Didn't get to try dessert, which is my only regret.",

Presentation for this would be 0 stars.  -Poached Farm Egg: 2/5 What the eff is this dish supposed to be? It was a hot mess. Putting poached egg in a dish does NOT make it fancy. It looked like they just mashed up a bunch of leftover ingredients on a plate. No bueno.  -Garganelli: 3/5 Meh pasta. We barely even touched this. Nothing particularly special.  -Grilled Shrimp: 4/5 Probably one of the better dishes of the night because it wasn't trying too hard. The tator tots and shrimp were an odd combo though.  -Fitto Misto: 4/5 Small oysters, but at least they were crispy fried and not soggy. Cauliflower oily AF.  -Brownie: 3/5 Will give you cavities it's so sweet. This was also left primarily untouched.  Service was good, but in terms of food, this place is over hyped. The food combinations and presentation were odd, and veered on the side of trying too hard. Stick to your name and just make plain, old good food.   I probably wouldn't come back again.",

No reservations, so get there earlier or be prepared to wait. This is small plates style and the food comes out as its made. It flows out perfectly. Very top notch drinks and service. I have never had a menu item I didn't love, which is saying a lot. They make a great aeperol spritz.   Favorite menu items:   Beef Carpacchio- yum Pommes Frites- pro tip: dip these in your mussel sauce.  Garganelli- recommended by a waiter and I get it every time. Awesome pasta. Simple but with so much flavor Mussels- the green curry sauce is to die for Steamed Bun- pork belly, enough said.  Fried oysters- flash fried, delish  Pot de creme- rich chocolately goodness  Chocolate brownie with ice cream- also great",

    "text": "Going to a play at Queens University so chose this very nice restaurant for a pre-show dinner.  Very nice, indeed.  Unfortunately, we did not have a lot of time so informed Jackie our wait person and thereby received expedited service.  Would have liked a more leisurely experience, so will plan a repeat visit to do just that.  Good Food on Montford is a tapas place.  A surprise to us...although a pleasant one.  Great menu of unusual offerings and an excellent by-the-glass wine list.  You have a card whereby you can order your items and keep track of your grazing experience.  We had a very nice Bordeaux wine at $12 a glass.  The PEI Mussels were excellent and a decent portion at $11 and good for sharing.  One of my weaknesses is sauteed mushrooms and they were excellent at $8.  Wife took on the Spring Rolls and reluctantly shared a bite, just a bite, with me and those went for $10.  A bit expensive, but taking in the selection, service and atmosphere, not that bad.    We realized after a bit that we were most likely the oldest customers in the place at age 72.  The tables were full of people in their 20s and 30s, with some all female and others all male diners.  Just an observation on our part.  Wish we had had more time to enjoy Montford's more, but the curtain was coming up at the Actors Theater of Charlotte and we had to leave.  You will have a nice evening here, regardless of your age.",

    "text": "I'll start this review off by saying after two separate experiences at Good Food, I'm going to have to give it 4 Stars.  The fisrt time I went to Good Food I wouldn't have dared to say a bad thing about it. The experience was perfect. Perfect food, perfect, wine, perfect service. Everything was spot on.  Because of that first experience, i was SUPER excited to bring a Charlotte visitor to Good Food so she could experience the awesomeness as well. Unfortunately, this go-round fell a little flat for all of us there.  When we arrived, we put our name down and went next door to grab a drink while we waited. This was a Friday night so we expected a little bit of a wait! After being seated, we saw there were a few menu changes that we were excited about.   There were a few standout dishes - the Garganelli pasta with sausage, garlic, tomato, the korean beef and crispy rice, and the steamed bun. But there were just as many misses - the scallops with acquerello risotto and the fried oysters to name a couple. They just straight up lacked salt, something I hadn't seen from Good Food in the past. Our server did remove the fried oysters from our plate, which we appreciated.  Other than that, the service was a bit on the meh side. Most of the dishes were brought out by runners who would just drop the plate and leave. Because of the different dishes we were eating, it would have been nice to get a description of the dish as well as clean plates!  I'm hoping that this second experience was just a hiccup and whenever I'm back  I'll be blown away again like the first time.",

The chicken has a mildly sweet sauce on it but not sickeningly sweet and somehow it didn't impact the crunch!  Because I'm a fry-lover, I swapped the mashed potatoes for fries and I wasn't disappointed. They're double-fried and flavorful (especially with a side of ranch).   The French dip was fantastic and came with an added bonus--onion rings in addition to fries!  We couldn't pass up bonbons for dessert and it was the perfect way to wrap up a fantastic meal. We will definitely go back next time we're in the area.",

Let's talk about the cocktails, so delish!   The parking can be a bit difficult, and the wait can be an hour or more so enjoy a cocktail while you wait!  I had some pasta and asked for them to make an affogato (ice cream with an espresso shot poured over it) for my desert.  They didn't hesitate even though it wasn't on the menu.  Very accommodating!   The prices are very reasonable for the serving sizes.  Their wine list is awesome too.  They are always pushing to make the customers happy, and I'm hoping they add more vegetarian options soon.  Check them out but call ahead for wait times.  You won't be disappointed.",

I give the gnocchi, scallops, and pork bun 5 stars! The gnocchi was our fave... the duck was awesome, the gnocchi was cooked perfectly, and the sauce is fantastic! And the portion was very generous for a small plate. Scallops with the grits were also fantastic. Pork bun was nice and big and the Asian flavors with the slaw were great! However, the quail was a bit underwhelming because it was kind of like a quail \"chicken\" fried tender. I would definitely skip next time. The shrimp & andouille risotto was also underwhelming... I think the risotto may have been overcooked and was bland IMO.   The service was a bit slow, but the waiter explained that they were unusually busy for a Monday night. I will definitely be back! 4 stars b/c the food that was good was REALLY REALLY good.",

The wait was long on a Friday evening, but it didn't matter because they have a great little patio where you can enjoy a glass of wine and some delicious appetizers. After spending an hour on the patio we were seated at our table where we enjoyed some of the most wonderful food. Because the menu is tapas style, we got to try many items off the menu (which means we got to spend a lot of money.. servings are small, prices not so small!) and I can't pick a favorite because every one of the dishes was fantastic! From the quail to the pork belly, the tilapia to the kimchi beef, even the duck pasta and the scallops, were all amazing. Okay, I know that doesn't help you, so if I had to make a recommendation of the three bestest items, I would pick the quail wraps, pork belly and the kimchi beef!  I'm a pretty conservative meat eater, and usually stick to white meats, but I went in with an open mind, and gave everything a try, and I'm glad that I did.  This restaurant should really be called Great food on Montford, it is undoubtedly one of my favorite places in the city now :)",

    "text": "We visited GFoM, based solely on the yelp rating, while visiting Charlotte between Christmas and New Year's weekends.  All I can say is, wow.  It's not the best-looking restaurant I've ever been to, it was kind of loud (on a VERY busy Thursday night), and parking was a challenge.    But - the food was spectacular, the service was impeccable, and the wines were divine.  The concept of simple fusion foods served on small plates works to perfection here, and I can honestly say that this was the best restaurant experience my wife and I have had in the past 5 years.  The dishes themselves were obviously well thought-out, and the fact that they were as good as they were, on a very busy night, speaks volumes about the skills of the kitchen team.  The dishes are pared down to the necessary elements, which tells me that a lot of thought went into the menu shoices and recipes.  Nothing excessive or unnecessary was added - just the food.  Perfection on a small plate!  We were sufficiently impressed that we swung by on our way out of town on New Years Eve, around 6 pm.  Even better, if that's possible!  Tammy, the bartender, was fabulous, and her recommendations were spot-on.  As a sidenote to Jason S's review - I've read this review several times, and I just don't think it's a fair assessment.  If you know that your wife has multiple special needs when it comes to food, would it not be part of normal planning and preparation to verify in advance that a restaurant can accomodate her needs?  To expect that they can just 'whip up' something special (off-menu) on a moment's notice is naive, at best.  It's a restaurant, not your mom and dad's kitchen...",

The service was wonderful, portions were huge (especially the green curry mussels), the vibe was perfect for a special occasion without feeling stuffy. Our favorite dishes were the pistachio ricotta gnocchi (we ordered without meat, so my vegetarian husband could have some - it was even better when we combined it with the sauteed wild mushrooms) and the poached egg with beet puree and root vegetables. The falafel was also outstanding. Everything is so flavorful and well seasoned. Highly recommend!",

Anniversary dinner came expecting a wait but we were seated right away...sat at the \"chef's counter\" which may have been the reason our server wasn't around much. We had 6 plates to share between the 2 of us and 2 desserts...surprisingly the pomes frites were the most memorable of the 6....probably the best fries we've ever eaten. The steamed bun was good but not as amazing as everyone says in my opinion, noquis were good and the sauce was superb. Desserts were very good both the peach cobbler and the cannoli cheese cake were excellent. Our only complaint was our server was hard to track down and seemed to stretched way to thin to provide adequate service to so many people.. Sitting at the chefs table we had a front row seat to watching the chef get angry that he had \"12 plates and no runners\"...as he dinged his bell over and over...maybe we just came on the wrong night",

However, while a lot of the individual components of their dishes were good, most of their dishes as a whole didn't live up to my expectations. We started off with their beef carpaccio. The fried pickles overpowered everything else on that plate. Enjoyed my squash soup, but the brussels sprouts weren't crispy enough. The dish I found most disappointing was their Korean beef. Maybe it's because I'm Korean, and I've had lots of Korean beef in my lifetime. In fact, I've pretty much had the exact same dish they were serving at Good Food from a food truck in San Francisco, except the food truck executed it infinitely better. The beef was too undercooked for me. The rice wasn't crispy enough. The kimchi, which is usually a perfect balance of salty, sweet, and spicy, was just spicy and maybe a little salty.",

    "text": "Good Food on Montford is located outside of the downtown Charlotte area. It is one of the better rated restaurants on Yelp and Trip Advisor. I had reviews that seemed to indicate that the staff and patrons could be a little \"stuck up\", so I kept that in mind before going there.  It was raining fairly hard on the day we went, so I didn't expect there to be a long wait as the restaurant does not take reservations.  The restaurant has a small plates concept, which seems to be the norm at a lot of places now.  After being seated and having had a chance to look over the menu, we decided to try a few dishes and depending on portion size to add more as we went.  The Arugula Salad ($7) came with arugula piled high topped with bacon and onions, with red and yellow watermelon adding a sweetness to counteract the mint vinaigrette. The salad was a good way to start the meal, but had a little too much dressing for my taste.  The Beer Battered Broccoli ($8) came with a cheddar foam and pickled jalapenos. The broccoli was crisp and not greasy. Just wish there would have been more as this was a hit.  The Steamed Bun ($10) came with loads of pork belly, hoisin and pickled vegetables. The vegetables counteracted the sweetness of the hoisin. This is a mash up of a banh mi and Peking duck and worked well.  The Korean Beef ($12) was set atop crispy rice garnished with scallion kimchi. The meat was tender, and although fire red gochujang could be seen the dish was lacking in the bold flavors and spice that Korean food is known for.  The Salmon ($13) was a southern take on gumbo. The salmon was crisp on the outside, and tender and moist on the inside. The sausage added some \"meatiness\" to the dish. Perhaps the best thing about the dish was the fried okra. It was light, crunchy and not slimy at all. They were so good, we ordered a side of fried okra.  The Parmesan Gnocchi ($13) were light and fluffy. The chicken was cooked well. The cream sauce added a level of comfort perfect for a cold night.  The Crispy Quail Lettuce Wraps ($11) were a take on chicken lettuce wraps seen on many menus. Slices of quail breast were intermingled with cucumber and Asian pear for textural contrast. This was probably the least favorite dish of the night.  The Chocolate Brownie ($7) is paired with Biscoff ice cream (who can resist that?). The portion is rather large. The brownie was nice and fudgy, and had a slightly crunchy crust.  The Pot De Creme ($7) combined chocolate and espresso. Unlike most chocolate pot de creme's that I have had, this one was a little lighter in texture which I enjoyed. A layer of whipped cream also helped to lighten the dish. This was the much better dessert in my opinion.  Service was friendly throughout the meal. I did not experience \"attitude\" problems that have some people have noted. I would not hesitate to eat here again.",

But if you like quality and well-put-together dishes then this could be a place you feel comfortable. It's small. It's probably got a wait. Don't be that guy who gets mad showing up at 7 on a Friday night and wondering why they can't seat you immediately. Don't do that. Enjoy the noms",

My husband and I were driving thru Charlotte and decided to stop by for dinner based on all the yelp reviews. We ordered curry mussels, garganelli (can't remember the spelling-tomatoe sausage pasta), and the Brownie dessert.  Bill came out to be $32 + tip. It was the perfect amount of food for us. We felt satisfied, but not overly stuffed. The server was super friendly even though we came in with our \"comfy clothes\" and all the other guests looked like they were on date night.   I highly recommend this place. Just an easy place to run to for some good food.",

I was honestly hoping for a little more, but the item was a bit on the bland side and the pork belly was a tad burnt. The scallop was delicious, but the sauce is a bit too sweet for my taste. Additionally, we for the mussels, which was great with a nice green curry sauce. This honestly was the favorite.",

    "text": "Good Food on Montfort has basically become a staple restaurant of Charlotte. When I moved here everyone told me I had to go. So one of my fellow Yelp friends actually brought me in for my first meal about 3 years ago and I was highly impressed that it lived up to the hype.  Fast forward 3 years and my friend moved into town and I was insistent that she had to try GFOM. So of course we go... We arrived a little before they opened (the wait game here is no joke) and there were already about 4-5 parties ahead of us. The doors opened and everyone was immediately seated. Can't speak for anyone that came in at 5:35pm.  I had 2 newbies with me and our waiter Craig did a good job of breaking down how things work. We placed an order for the following:  Gnocchi  Green Curry Mussels  Steamed pork bun Beef carpaccio  Apple Cobbler Crispy Clam Strips  Bottle of Prosecco  Needless to say after 7 shareables not one of us was impressed. Rather, I was highly disappointed that my friends experience was nowhere near what I had. The one dish (gnocchi) I raved about the most was probably the worst. I assume because the menu is seasonal, the amazing gnocchi with lamb was replaced with an over cooked chewy version of whatever they served. It was horrible! The crispy clam strips were flavorless. So bad we asked for chili oil or something, anything to bring it to life. The Steamed bun (which was also one of my favorites) was super salty but otherwise ok. I mean...we literally could not stop saying how disappointed we were. With every dish we were hopefully but there was NO Good Food on Montfort!",

Within 15 minutes of me getting there, the restaurant was SLAMMED! I was seated and ordered a couple of small plates included the steamed buns and the korean beef. Both were delish and well executed. I loved the crispy rice on the korean dish. I also grabbed dessert which is a rare occurrence for me. I went with the brownie and ice cream, which sounds simple but it was the BEST brownie that i've have in Charlotte. I would go back just for it. Enjoyed the visit here.",

I came with 5 other people and must have sampled more than half of the small plates as well as almost all of the desserts. To drink I had a jalapeno paloma which was one of the better cocktails I've had recently.  My favorite dishes were the pork carnitas, mussels, risotto, and gnocchi. The goat cheese really took the carnitas to the next level. I was a bit wary to try mussels for the first time, but the green curry coconut milk broth was amazing. I'm usually disappointed by gnocchi, but the lamb in this dish made it anything but boring. There were a few relatively basic dishes (including a couple desserts) and I remember not liking the mushroom ravioli. Still, the success rate was more than respectable.",

We got:  the carnitas taco, the mussels, the risotto, the mushroom ravioli, the gnocchi with lamb, the fried quail, and butternut squash soup. And then for dessert: the pot de creme, the cardamon pound cake with yogurt and the brownie with biscoffe ice cream. I'll say the taco and the mussels were the standouts for me but most every single dish was delish! The only one I didn't care for was the ravioli. And for dessert I was obsessed with that pound cake which was extra surprising for this chocolate lover!  I love this type of small plates place where you can just have little bites of a ton of stuff. Would def recommend this place for some good eats.",

    "text": "This is a mid sized restaurant located on Montford drive. Good luck finding a parking spot if you arrive during the peak hours. This restaurant is extremely popular and has a huge wait time. We did checkin online through the Yelp App but little did it help. When we got there we were given the choice between more wait time or getting seats at the chef table.  After taking the seats we learnt the hard way to never say yes to the chef table. It was all the way at the corner of the restaurant and made us feel like we were literally sitting inside the kitchen! All noisy and steamy, we never got to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant. Looking at the rest of the restaurant it felt over packed with tiny tables placed close together. If you want some privacy this isn't your restaurant.  Our waitress showed up after some wait and we ordered soup, shrimp tempura, fried chicken and gnocchi. The dishes came to our table super fast in no specific order. The soup came last! The gnocchi was excellent and our favorite. The tempura was alright and the squash soup was overly gingerly. But not all dishes held up to the deliciousness that this restaurant was known for.   The fried chicken was extremely undercooked! Totally pink inside with the smell of fresh meat! Regretted having tried it. We waited for our waiter to show up but she only came back for the check.   The one undercooked dish has caused so much aggravation within us that we decided to never comeback to this restaurant. Again this is my personal experience and choice to not visit anymore - my experience has made it to be Bad Food on Montford!",

Once we came in the host (guy) did catch his name was very nice and was always hard at work and busy. When we got a table, we gotten our bread and water right away! I was impressed because it was pretty busy, so you know it was staff correctly.   Our waitress came over, she was very friendly and knowledgeable. Since it was our first time here she even went over the menu with us and the most popular dishes. She was quick and always attentive as well. She constantly checked up on us at appropriate times. She was great! Seriously, thank you for having great staff.   The food! Small plates but wow... delicious! I didn't even want to share any of my plates with my friend. The mushrooms and falafel was amazing!! I was beyond surprised. The prices were on the higher side, but that's any tapas places. It's normal. I will be back to try other options or maybe just to get the same plates! Ha. But even my friend was amazing, we will be back. thank you all, keep up the hard work! It doesn't go unnoticed.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this restaurant, I mean any place with a simple yet bold name like \"Good Food\" is one I clearly needed to try.   There were four of us that sat at the bar. We really wanted cocktails and the small plates were a later decision but the best of the evening.   The bartender did her job...the minimum expectation was met but there wasn't that fun bartender/patron convo I enjoy about sitting at the bar verses at a table. No big deal though. Of their signature cocktails none really stood out as \"must trys\" for us so we asked the bartender if she'd mix up a bourbon drink. She said no. I thought she was kidding. She wasn't. The drinks we had were ok.   The food was definitely good! Everyone enjoyed their dish. It's important to remember that the portions are smaller, but the quality is there! There are many places in the area to grab a great cocktail so that's not reason not to go here. I'll go back for the food, for sure!",

The top food items for me are the fettuccini in a creamy fennel sauce and the pork steam bun, but everything was seriously delicious. Including the bread which I indulged in before our guests even arrived because I was so hungry and our waiter, Jonathan, quickly brought more.   Jonathan was excellent. He explained the menu, made recommendations, and even brought out a specialty cider sample for my cousin to try. He laughed with us and made the evening even more pleasant.   The wine selection was great and Jonathan offered me tastes of two so I could decide which to order. The beer and cocktail selections were also well-crafted. Now I am hungry and I want to go back! Go here and you will not be disappointed, but go with a few people so you can try lots of tasty menu items!",

Plenty of wines to choose from as well as beer and cocktails. The food is family/tapas style which I love because you get to try a variety of foods. We went with the Korean beef, mussels and the garganelli pasta. All were SOO GOOD! Love going to a place where everything is top notch. The sauce around the mussels was good enough to eat by itself (we got extra bread to dip in there) and the beef & pasta were so good. Definitely cant wait to go back!",

I had a cider beer and my husband a bourbon cocktail. We had the frittes, Korean beef, garganelli first and the scallops and chicken adobo, secondly. I loved everything but the Korean beef, it was just okay. The collards with the chicken adobo were really good surprisingly. Now what I didn't like; The service. We ordered 3 tapas at once. There was a huge lag between our fries and garganelli dish. Upwards 20+ minutes. Also the chicken took a long time to come out. So much so we almost cancelled it. Funny enough the tables beside us got their food before us and we ordered the same things around the same time. So the food gets a 4 and the service a 2. I'll see what other tapas Charlotte has to offer before I go back.",

This is hands down THE best quality food in Charlotte that I've had. I was amazed at the quality of food for the price we paid. If you're in Uptown, take the drive here- completely worth it.   Things you have to get- *Calamari: It's so fresh and perfectly battered. I love the light drizzle of honey that gives the balance of sweet that you typically don't expect in a seafood item  *Sauteed Mushrooms: Perfectly cooked and high quality.   *Any of the pastas: All the pastas are so fresh, you can taste how soft and freshly cooked it is. The meat and cheeses that go into it are high quality as well. You can't go wrong with any of the pastas.   *Meats: The meats rotate through the most. I would suggest getting your favorite type of meat. The Korean Beef is fantastic.   *Dessert: I am not a dessert person, but I always leave room when I come here. My all-time favorite is the peach cobbler with lavender ice cream. However, it's seasonal The brownie with Biscoff ice cream is constantly on the menu, and incredible. The brownie is so warm and so soft, and the Biscoff ice cream melts on top. The pear cheesecake is also fantastic. Again, don't skip on dessert.",

The dishes are all small plates and the way to go is definitely just share a bunch amongst the table. All three pasta dishes we had were great, especially the gnocchi which was the perfect texture. The French fries were practically mind-blowing: a great Parmesan flavor without being overbearing or oily. The steamed bun has great textures and is light yet savory. It's a little hard to share but definitely worth the bite. The scallops and fried chicken were also wonderful, both had eclectic bases that complemented each really well. Would surely order all of them again.   The bread is slightly disappointing given how good the olive oil is and not all of the dishes are stellar -- such as the arugula salad which was just okay -- but most of them are.",

Those arriving a few minutes later had a more difficult time with parking and also experienced a wait for a table.  The three of us ordered Poached   Farm Egg, Garganelli, Steamed Bun, and P.E.I. Mussels, which was enough for an early light dinner.  The food was all fantastic.  The Poached Farm Egg was ordered because it sounded different.  The combination of textures and flavors worked well.  The Gsrganellei was well done - enjoyable, but not quite on the level of the other  three dishes.  In many restaurants, this would have been called a stellar dish - but here everything was top notch.  Even #4 in ranking is a winner.  The Steamed Bun was the hit of the show - clearly #1 among the items we ordered.  Delicious does not do the dish justice!  The P.E.I. Mussels were wonderful.  The green curry was the perfect compliment to the mussels.  Service was excellent - attentive, helpful, prompt - without hovering.",

They do have a waitlist when you go on the yelp app which is a bit nice. Parking is also a bit hard to find if you go at a busier time. The place in general is smaller but has a nice ambience. Because it's smaller its much more loud.  Food overall is not too bad. There were some stuff I loved and some stuff that were alright. The mussels, calamari and truffle fries were to die for. Everything else was a hit or miss for me.",

    "text": "As other reviews had mentioned, we got there around 9:30 on a Saturday night, and it was packed. For two people, they told us it was an hour wait, but we were seated within 30 minutes. It seems like the restaurant is geared more toward smaller groups because I didn't see any tables that could seat more than four people.   We ordered five tapas to share: the falafels, Vietnamese stuffed quail, Korean beef, pork belly bun, and parmesan gnocchi. Overall, the food was pretty good.   The falafels and Vietnamese stuffed quail were both cooked well. My least favorite was the parmesan gnocchi...the gnocchi and duck confit were good, but the sauce was just so heavy. It reminded me a lot of cream of mushroom soup. It definitely needed something to brighten it up, like lemon. However, I really enjoyed the pork belly soft bun and Korean beef on crispy rice.  The atmosphere was nice and cozy, albeit tables a little crowded together so we were pretty close to our neighbors. Service was fine--our bread and my one glass of wine came after we got some of our tapas, but it was also pretty busy.  With five different dishes and wine, our bill came out to be around $85 with tip and tax. I'm giving Good Food only three stars because while I enjoyed the experience and the food, I wouldn't say that I would come back unless someone else wanted to go. Especially considering the price point, many of the dishes at Good Food were not really unique to me--I can either make them at home or find at some of my other favorite places for a fraction of the cost (i.e. pork steam buns at Athen's The World Famous--3 equally delicious buns for $8).   Summary: Very busy on a weekend night so expect a wait, tasty but pricey food, cozy atmosphere, great place to just experience or go on a date but not somewhere I'd go again.",

We usually go to Montford for the nightlife, but I was so glad to find this restaurant tucked onto one of our favorite streets.  The restaurant is chic and inviting, we were greeted almost instantly and only had to wait about 5 minutes while they set a table for us.   While the beer and wine-by-the-glass lists were not huge, they were definitely very good for what we wanted.   We decided to do tapas instead of ordering plates for ourselves, and even then, we had a hard time choosing between all of the small plates. We went with the cheese platter, the mussels in the coconut curry and the Morrocan Spiced Chicken Confit. The cheeses were each paired with a sauce; honeycomb, truffle or chutney to spread on a piece of toast to really bring out the flavor. As many other people have said, the mussels and chicken were both amazing. The chef clearly has a way of playing with flavors, and each of the dishes tasted like nothing I've ever had before.   I had a great evening here and will be sure to go back again! I high recommend Good Food.",

Last week, I arrived at Good Food after work with a group of four friends. The time, 5:15pm. Weather, 90 degrees.   We tried the door and it was locked. I thought maybe the restaurant was closed for a private event so I waved to someone inside to ask if we should go elsewhere. The server (manager?) came over and said that they would open at 5:30pm and then closed the door.  No offer for water, no offer for menus to look over while we waited... outside in the heat.    5:30 came around....then 5:35...5:40.... We thought it was weird that they hadn't opened so another friend in our group went to check. Oh...they HAD opened and unlocked the door...they just hadn't bothered to tell us. Thanks, pal.   We were seated and the rest of the party arrived - table of seven. I can only assume that since they automatically add 20% tip (and will not split checks) for parties over 6, the server did not care about service. Unfriendly, impatient, inattentive.  This experience was a real shame.",

You will want to drink it when the mussels are gone... trust me.  The Moroccan Spiced Chicken Confit was also amazing.  The dish is served in a miniature Tagine and the tender and delicious chicken with a wonderfully crispy skin is served on top of a delicious bed of chick peas, apricots, and candied lemon zest.

Doesn't matter, the food, the service and the interior of this place more than make up for it.  I went here with my girlfriend for a late night dinner and was immediately impressed with the decor when I first walked in.  It wasn't overly crowded but we were also there late on a Monday night.  I love the unique lighting fixtures that utilize spoons and forks as decoration.  The bar is a stainless steel top which gives the place a bit of an industrial feel too.  Then to offset the cold industrial feel, you have the right amount of lighting to warm it up along with the wood ceilings with accent reveals to give it even more contrast.  Architecturally I am in love.    The service was fantastic, very polite, very attentive, knew the menu very well and made us feel like we were the only ones there.  We finished the night out on the patio with a glass of wine and although the view isn't one that will ooh and ahh, so to speak, the furniture is very comfortable and somewhere I could see myself spending a few hours easily.  Do yourself a favor, if you like tapas style food, pay this place a visit.  They don't call it Good Food on Montford for nothing!",

It just melts in your mouth. I could indulge in that all day.   Desserts are delicious and scrumptious.  Small and cozy place. Very intimate setting. More for couples or small groups.  Staff is nice and welcoming.  Highly recommend if you do have the extra money to splurge because it is well worth it.",

    "text": "Third time's a charm for Good Food! Yes, we've tried to eat here twice before and both times the wait was astronomical (2 hours, 1 hr 45 min). So, that's the first tip for everyone - the folks at Good Food do not take reservations, um, ever, I think?  But onto the evening, inside GFOM is simple, understated yet elegant. There's a pretty and low key bar, a fair number of tables and wonderful staff. Hubs and I were seated within minutes and tried a sampling of dishes. Before I get to the eats, I will concur with others - I think the plates (small and large) are a bit on the pricey side. So, perhaps it's not the most fiscally responsible move to head here when you're super hungry as the portions are small. Food time...  Mixed green salad: 4/5: A lovely salad, delicious and light with baby parsnips, cranberries and hazelnuts. Super light and a perfect way to start the feeding.  Smoked Salmon: 5/5: I don't even really like (or order) smoked salmon and I loved this dish. The fresh, smoked salmon with egg, potato & capers with dill creme fraiche was a perfect blend of flavors. The little chippers were great!   Seared Scallop w/risotto: 3/5: My lease favorite of the dishes as I was expecting more complex flavor. While the items reads beautifully, butternut squash risotto, shaved fennel & bacon, my scallop (there were 2 on the plate) was quite undercooked and lacked depth.   Steamed Bun: 4/5: Nom worthy. It's been a long time since I've had a steamed pork bun of this caliber. The five spice rubbed pork belly was perfectly tender yet crispy on the edges and I loved the hoisin & pickled vegetables.  Baked Cavatappi: 3/5: A good baked pasta dish w/fresh, gooey mozzarella. Coming from a family of very talented Italian cooks, I wasn't wowed by the sauce but I did really love the Italian sausage mixed in.   Pork tenderloin (the only large plate we ordered): 3/5: The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and intense with smokey flavor yet the fried mac 'n cheese triangles were underwhelming. I didn't taste much cheese!   Pumpkin Bread Pudding: 5/5: Drool. Sometimes I'm hesitant to order bread pudding because I get so disappointed when it turns out all French toast like. But this bread pudding was moist, bursting with delectable pumpkin flavor and topped with a gorgeous sliver of pumpkin seed brittle and some of the most delicious cheesecake ice cream I've had. Get it.   Since the menu is eclectic and certainly inspired, I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more good food from GFOM!",

But it's really because the food is just incredible - mmmm factor every time- better yet, with every dish!   Someone mentioned that the mussels in curry sauce was drinkable ...yes it is! Ask for more bread to really soak it all up - that makes it!  The other dish I loved was the duck fettuccine - holy deliciousness. Flavors melded to perfection.   The pork bun ....aaaaamazing. I am not a huge pork person but the hoisin sauce mixed with the pickled veggies - deeelish.   and just in case I wasn't completely in bliss my dessert sent me over the top, pear cake with avocado ice cream and salted caramel - I know it sounds odd but just get it!  Wish drinks were more reasonably priced and the checks splittable ( yes I had to write out each cost for 7 people- not just what they had....really ?) ....   but the food is so delicious it would be a shame not to give this place 5 stars! This place is a party in my mouth!",

Pork belly wasn't as crispy as I thought it would be Truffle fries: good, but again didn't live up to the hype Lobster ravioli: extreeeeemely small portion for $14 (only four tiny ravioli?) but the taste was awesome. The mushrooms on top were delish as well Saag paneer: tasty but not mind-blowingly good Shrimp - absolutely delicious, by far my favorite meal of the night. The shrimp was so tender and the garlic chili sauce was great.   All in all, it was a fine experience. The food wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't amazing either (except for the shrimp). The restaurant has a nice ambiance and our server was great. Definitely worth checking out but I would prepared to walk out saying \"meh\".   It's also worth noting that the portions are tiny. I'm no stranger to small tapas portions (and often prefer them!) but some of the dishes (ravioli, shrimp) were abnormally small.",

Good Food at Montfort is superb!  We were greeted by the host of the restaurant, very personable and smart who was as elated as we were that after a few minutes a table awaited us. He came back to speak with us to see how our meal was and  even helped with some travel plans The small plates are so fun, so very tasty and quite diverse.  Our server, Michael, was easy-going, knowledgeable about the food and gave us a brief run down of the most popular dishes.   Food servers were very friendly as well.  We chose the Telga Greens, Fried Chicken, Garganelli and the Pork Bun.  Outstanding!  The Biscof Ice Cream Brownie was especially delicious since the brownie is served warm.   Excellent.",

Menu is set up with apps, small plates and large plates and meant to be shared like tapas. Ordered 2 apps(Mixed Green & Salmon), 3 small plates (Scallops, Steamed Bun, Cavatappi) and 1 large plate (pork tenderloin) for the two of us. All food comes out as soon as it's ready, so if you want it delivered in a specific order, space out your ordering.   Service is spot on and you'll see multiple friendly faces at your table. My favorites were the Salmon, Scallop & Pork Tenderloin. Least favorite was the Steamed Bun, though this seems to be the most popular dish as I saw about 20 of them leave the kitchen while we were eating. We ended the meal with the bread pudding...so good, and the cheesecake ice cream was a perfect addition.   Definitely a place I'll return with family and friends! Great date place too! Expect to wait 1 hour + on weekends during peak times as they do not take reservations. Go on a Wed or Thurs and your 7pm arrival will be greeted with a quick table!",

    "text": "At this point, Good Food on Montford is just that, good not great.  We got there at 8pm and the wait was just over 2 hours for a 4 top.  I can certainly appreciate the level of popularity this restaurant has sparked, but the inability to make reservations surprises me.  We were meeting another couple so were in no rush, but when I go back, I will have to be strategic on when we go so as not to have to wait so long.    The bartender was excellent and attentive and we were able to enjoy a bottle of wine before being seated.  As a side note, I was disappointed that there was no available Chianti on the menu.  That's typically all I drink and not a rare type so thought it odd.  Our waitress was good but appeared overwhelmed by other service.  It took 10 minutes for her to first come over after we were seated.  My first order was the Pork Bun (because it seemed quite popular via Yelp) but they had apparently sold their last one minutes before.  Big disappointment.  I ordered the Charcuterie (foie gras & chicken liver mousse, speck & chefs selection [Excellent], Korean beef crispy rice & scalloin kimchi [Very Good], Arctic char chilled israeli couscous & dried fruit salad & apricot beurre blanc [Very Good], and a forgettable pasta of some sort.  We were two bottles of wine in by this point and had spent well over 3 hours there with slow service so we left in disappointment and ended up going across the street and munching on barfood over a few beers.  The food overall was very good and above the average Charlotte fare.  The overall experience was lacking and service was subpar.  It's quite expensive for what you get but I'm okay with this for high quality.  I'm a firm believe in 2nd and 3rd chances prior to writing off a place so I'm hopeful our next visit will warrant an updated more positive review.  The Yelp crowd seems to love it so I'm hopeful I caught them on a bad night.",

My favorite things are the fries (you need to order the fries), the mussels and the gnocci. My husband and I spend about $85 including tip and tax for a generous meal for two with dessert, but no wine. The only thing that IMO disappoint are the desserts. Not bad, but I've never had something and went WOW and I think I've had most items on the menu.",

The mussels were really small, overcooked maybe. and kind of disappointed me. The green curry sauce was phenomenal though and delicious soaked up with the grilled naan! Corn risotto, perfect and sweet and eaten after the curry cleansed my palate and left a refreshing taste. My favorite of the evening. The dessert was some sort of macadamia nut pie with banana ice cream. I didn't like it very much, tasted too much like a mashed up frozen banana to me, but my dining partners liked it a lot.

It was delicious, it had hints of sweet and spicy that I've never had in a drink.  We started out by sharing everything -   First the PORKBUN - sorry I get excited, but it's delicious, I'm sad that I had to share it, oh sweet regret!!   We followed the bun with seared scallops, Korean beef, and pork tenderloin. All juicy, savory and delicious.  Since we still had room we each ordered a dessert - my boyfriend got the apple cake - warm with vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup. I got the pecan pie with banana ice cream and caramel sauce.  Good Food had a great atmosphere, and a friendly attentive wait staff. It was a pleasure talking to the chef at the captains table, very informative, and helpful with all our selections.

    "text": "We had heard rave reviews about Good Food and were looking forward to our first visit on Friday.  Needless to say, they did not disappoint.   Items are server tapas or small plates style for sharing which is great as we wanted to try just about everything on the menu.  Our favorites were the steamed bun stuffed with a hoisin glazed pork belly, and the house made sausage and pasta (We ended up ordering a second round of each for the table).   The mussels, gazapacho, charcuterie and quail lettuce wraps were excellent as well.  This place is really unique inside, looking a bit like Herman Miller got his hands on an old 50's family style restaurant.   Cozy bar with seating for about 15, the dining area seats around 60 or 70 at most.   We enjoyed food and drinks for over two hours and never felt rushed by the very knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Parking is limited in their lot, but if you get their early enough there is plenty of parking across the street or on the street itself.  We are already making plans for our next visit!",

Next I had a portion of the pea soup - this soup would have been superior had it not been excessively salty. Last on my list: lamb belly. The small roulades look a little skimpy at first but, oh my goodness, they are so rich, I could not have eaten any more! It was a perfect portion of such a wonderfully flavored dish - very good, highly recommended.",

The hostess was friendly,  the atmosphere was great dimmed lighting gave a romantic feel but overall this place is just hip.  It's classy but comfortable and all of the staff will make you feel at home.  They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait especially on a weekend night.  I visited on a Thurs. night had to wait about ten minutes which was nothing plus I always enjoy checking out the bar in a new place.  The bartender was very friendly and did not go wrong when she asked my how dirty I wanted my martini on a scale from 1 to 5 umm 5 please and thank you for asking. Just when I didn't think my dirty martini could get any better yup you guessed it blue cheese stuffed olives I was already in heaven.    Now for the food.  What is great about the food is it's served tapas style so you have the opportunity to try all kinds of dishes.  A few of the dishes that I thought were yelp worthy quail lettuce wraps, the gnocchi with brussel sprouts and cream sauce this dish was addicting I think I could have eaten the whole order all by myself.  I also enjoyed the steamed bun with pork belly.  Save room for dessert because the strawberry cheesecake is so worth it (unfortunately I think it was a special so hopefully they bring it back real soon!)",

    "text": "My favorite restaurant BY FAR in Charlotte and maybe the best restaurant anywhere in the SE.  I know those are strong words, but believe me the food quality is out of this world good.  I can keep listing adjectives to describe the place, but they will simply not do it justice.  There are so many great dishes here, let me try to recap some of my favorites:  Gnocchi - I am a huge gnocchi fan in general and this may be the best I've ever had.  It comes with a great cream sauce, the pasta itself is perfectly soft, just enough cheese and chunks of bacon.  Simply incredible.  Just getting this dish alone is worth coming here.  Lamb Belly - Wow.  The flavors in this dish are amazing.  So many things happening here and the lamb is crunchy yet soft, awesome, awesome dish.  Pork Tenderloin - I have NEVER had pork this tender.  EVER.  Perfectly seasoned and perfectly prepared.  The chorizo hash that accompanies is really good as well.  This is a must order.  Pork Bun - You may not think this is the thing to get, but you would be wrong.  You have to order this dish.  The bun is puffy and soft and the meat inside is so flavorful.  Love this dish.  Pomme Frites - Excellent french fries.  Just thick enough, great crunch, great seasoning.  I LOVE their fries.  Are you starting to get the point.  This is a never ending list.  EVERY dish here is at the very least really really good and at most heavenly perfection.  Cool atmosphere, it's normally pretty busy, good service though as everyone is very friendly.  Good drinks as well, I actually really like their Pom Margarita...  I would literally go there once a week if I lived in Charlotte.  I will come back here EVERY chance I have.  Unbelievable restaurant.",

    "text": "Wow!  This place is appropriately named.  We came about a quarter after 6 on a Saturday night, which I soon realized was strategic planning on my friend's part because we managed to get in just before it got super busy.  We had no wait.  Score.  I took a peek at the menu and realized that I was being faced with the challenge of deciding which small plates to order (out of so many that all sounded delicious).  I let my friend, who has been here many times, take the wheel on that one.  Each small plate came out one at a time, so we had plenty of time to savor and enjoy each one individually.  Here's what we ordered:  The American farmhouse cheeses with truffle chutney and honey.  Served with bread.  I LOVE CHEESE.  AND CHUTNEY.  AND HONEY.  Yum.  I could have ordered another one of these but alas, we had a lot more food on the way.  The steamed bun.  I've had pork bellies one other time at a dim sum place up in the DC area.  I loved them there and I loved them here at Good Food too.  The meat was so sweat and so was the bun... a perfect combo!  Seared scallops.  They were ever so flavorful and cooked just the right amount.  By this point in the evening I was already entering a food coma from all the deliciousness, but there was still a lot more to come.  Some kind of pasta that was A-MAZING.  I'm currently looking at the menu on the website to get my food titles right, but I don't see this item on there.  I hope they didn't get rid of it because it might have been my favorite thing we ordered!  The fish.  We only added this to our order after hearing a nearby table rave about it.  Yes, it was good.  Everything at this point was good.  I was stuffed, but somehow managed to make room in my belly for dessert.  For dessert we ordered the apple cobbler.  It was warm and cinnamon-y and delicious.  Despite how full we were, we managed to scarf this down in what seemed like under 5 minutes.  I've eaten at a lot of good restaurants in North Carolina, and this one ranks among the best in my opinion.  I don't have a single complaint about the evening.  I had heard coming in that the service gets to be somewhat lacking when they get really busy, but the service was great the night I was there.  Overall, I had a perfect dining experience.",

    "text": "After hearing so many word of mouth raves about this place we decided to check it out during a beautiful summer evening.   The restaurant is located on Montford and has a distinct retro-modern natural vibe inside (think exposed brick and wood). There is a simple patio outside and a parallel bar area with high tables (which is where we sat). There is a lot of energy inside so don't expect a quiet meal.  As many have stated, the menu is tapa's style, with a number of small plates, along with entree's should you desire. The menu is seasonal so what we ate may not be available later in the year.   Everything from the arugula salad to the falafel to the seared scallops with corn was wonderful. The service is just right, attentive without being overly pushy and the wine list is lively.  Overall a great experience and fine night - both this place and Barrington's top my list of Charlotte's best.",

The cocktails are really well crafted. I ordered the 1701 Sangria and it was so good that I ordered another. We had about 4-5 dishes to share between two people and that was definitely enough. Everything we had was wonderful but one dish stands out to me- the beer battered broccoli! So yummy. We ordered coffee and the chocolate brownie for dessert- the brownie came with biscotti ice cream that they make in house and of course chocolate sauce. That dessert was seriously so good that I thought about it for days afterward. The service was very good and the place seemed clean, but the only reason this review is not 5 stars is because after I finished my meal I got up to use the restroom and walking over I noticed a large cockroach crawling up the wall (not near any of the food). I brought it to the employees' attention and it was detained immediately, but still a little disconcerting.",

When my GF graduated college I wanted to take her to the best restaurant in the QC and saw how highly rated this place was on Yelp.  Well they didn't disappoint.  The place is kind of neat because it is fancy and white tablecloth-y, but you wouldn't stick out that bad if you were dressed casual but nice.  The waitstaff didn't seem pretentious at all either.  They are totally down to earth and made good recommendations.  It is pricey, but actually the price per dish isn't that bad at all, although the portion size is quite small of course.  If you are starving and want to fill up it is going to cost you.  We got like half of the dishes on their menu and they were all very good.  They accidentally gave us someone else's Korean Beef, which was a good bonus since it was delish.  I thought it was one of our orders!  Good wine selection and fantastic decor.  The \"mood lighting\" is definitely dark, which makes it a little tough to see your food, but it's acceptable.    Parking can be pretty rough and if you want to take a walk around after your meal, your options are somewhat limited.  I tried to take a lap around the block and had to scale parking garages and jump puddles to take a loop, but hey that's Charlotte for ya.",

I finally figured out why, now I need to figure out why it took me so long to eat here.  So they don't take reservations, and we are told by the greeter at the door, who looks like a kinder, gentler version of Ted Nugent, that there is an hour wait.  We give our name and head to the bar trying to find a place to stand and order drinks.  Great service at the bar and not a half hour goes by before \"Ted\" comes over to get us to our table.  Rachel is our server and she explains the whole tapas style of the restaurant and makes suggestions as well as discusses specials.  She says that most people order 3 or 4 items typically.  Well by the time that we are done, we have ordered 8 items and while everything had great flavors and was expertly prepared, my favorites are the confit of lamb belly and the arctic char appetizer.  Also, the cheese plate was the perfect amount for desert, as we bypassed the typical desert fare to finish off the meal.  The wife really enjoyed the steamed bun and the scallop, but we both felt that everything was really well prepared.  This place is really a gem for Charlotte, and clearly they are humble as well.  Seriously, Great Food on Montford!",

When we first sat down they brought roasted garlic and balsamic/olive oil. The waitress suggested a great glass of wine and we picked our plates. We shared the frites, quail lettuce wraps, the gnocchi, Korean beef and the chocolate cupcake for dessert. The frites needed something, perhaps it was just missing ketchup? The quail wraps were spicy and gingery, the gnocchi was wonderful full of mushrooms and delicious chicken. The Korean beef was really nice on a fried white rice, like actually deep fried. The cupcake was really yummy. It seemed to have two kinds of chocolate in it and the meringue was light as melted marshmallows.",

    "text": "2.5 years later and this place is hitting the marks. This time the dinner party sat at the bar which was empty (we didn't RSVP). This is when I realize that there is no TV at the bar. You won't hear me complain about that.  Service was good enough. She kept our drinks filled and checked in occasionally. Food was still excellent. The charcutier plate offered 3 meat (3 slices each) along with a small thing of foie gras & chicken liver mousse and grilled bread. I never had foie gras before, it was very tasteful. The other person said it was solid and he had eaten foie gras everywhere. Next up was Korean Beef. It was a little small in portion, but another taste explosion. Beef were cooked medium rare and sliced and sat on top of a square crispy rice cake with the whole thing topped with grilled scallions and covered in spicy kimchi sauce. It hit the spot just right. We also mixed in the old standby PEI Mussels in green curry & coconut broth. This is always my favorite. I wish there were more than 2 pieces of pita. I swear I would pick up that bowl and lick it if I could. And lastly we had the steamed bun. It is one steamed bun for the record. It makes sharing a little difficult. But it was very good, the pork belly was meaty not fatty, and the flavor was perfect. I'm really glad to see that a place can consistently put out quality food. The price is not that bad for what you got. Believe me, I've paid more for worse which is nothing I like to brag about. GFOM, well done, and keep up the good work.",

    "text": "Good Food on Montford wasn't just good.  It was AMAZING!!!  Like in big, bold letters with lots of underlining and specialized font.  My hubby and I went there for a romantic yet chill dinner, and this place didn't disappoint.  It's got a trendy, dark, cool ambiance with lots of candles.  We were promptly seated at one of the cute high tops and had an awesome waitress.  Started off with the pumpkin mixed drink - and this is my only complaint really.  It was a little thick and hard to suck up the straw.  And the glass was FILLED with ice, which kept plunking in my face.  No so sexy.  But all of the food we ordered was divine!  The concept is small plates, like tapas. We got the butternut squash soup (which they thoughtfully divided up for us into two bowls rather than letting us make asses of ourselves passing the bowl back and forth) which was very sweet, dessert-like is what my hubby said.  The pork belly sandwich was great - not quite as amazing as what others had written, but still fabulous.  The scallops were INCREDIBLE!  I typically don't like scallops, but if they were typically prepared like this, I would ALWAYS order them!  They were fluffy and light, prepared with an incredible risotto like side dish.  Our final dinner plate was the garganelli, which was by far my favorite.  It was a little spicy, just enough for a kick.  The sausage was incredible!  We couldn't pass up on dessert.  I had a chocolate-espresso pot de creme - fabulously rich in a great way.  I had a tough time finishing it though.  It's a little heavy, but not in a fudge way where you can feel it from the first bite.  You think you can finish the whole thing, but then the heaviness slowly sneaks up on you.  Or maybe I just ate too much in general.  Hubby had the pumpkin cake, which was quite delish too.  Can't comment on the cheesecake ice cream as I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but judging on how he ate all of his dessert without barely offering to share, I think he was quite happy.  All in all, yummy, fabulous place for a date night.  Although I saw some groups of friends who seemed to be having a good time too.",

Montford Drive is a street with a long culinary history for me, with such favorites as The Ole Smokehouse, the Roasting Company and Luisa's Pizza. In contrast to those places, Good Food on Montford is more upscale, serving mostly small plates at fairly high prices. Several of the plates we tried were outstanding, including the ceviche, the mushrooms, the lamb tangine and the fried oysters. We also really enjoyed dessert, especially the cherry cobbler with ice cream.  My complaints about this place include the noise - so loud we could not hear each other despite being at a table for six closest to the front window - and the prices. Even my dad's \"large plate\" of fish was quite small and at $17, not exactly inexpensive. I am glad that Charlotte's restaurant selection is growing so rapidly, and certainly the food here shows a sophistication never before seen on Montford Drive. Although it's not a restaurant for everyday dining, I'd definitely return here for another tasty meal.",

If you are like me and have a hard time deciding between different options this is a great place to go. Smallish plates made for sharing. I love any restaurant that perpetuates sharing of food!! On top of that the food is amazing. The decor is nice albeit simple, and the restaurant is pretty cozy without being too crowded, at least that night. The drinks were tasty and our waitress/waiter were full of awesome recommendations and swift service. I can't believe it took me so long to come and I can't believe that I haven't been back recently.

As we settled in, our waitress informed us it was perfectly acceptable to order courses two at a time, or however we wanted. Cool.  For our first round, we got the cheese plate and the charcuterie. The cheese plate was great: nice selection of cheeses and interesting accompaniments like fresh honeycomb and truffle chutney. The charcuterie was more okay: it came with speck (kind of like fancy bologna, meh), saucisson (a step up from Pepperidge Farm) and an awesome fois gras and chicken liver mousse. Would love to see some other meats like sopprassata on this in the future.  Next we took a trip to Asia with the steamed bun and cold noodles. The five-spice-rubbed pork bun was packed with flavor and a nicely textured bun on the outside. It may have been a tad heavy on the hoisin, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. The cold noodles were an awesomely unique combination of braised pork, pickled watermelon, cashews and sesame dressing--a nice chefy take on a traditional dish.  By the time we finished this, we were stuffed, even though we wanted to order more. Loved the concept and the execution here. Only criticism: every time we laid our forks down, a waiter appeared and tried to snatch our plates away. It made us feel extremely rushed, but I guess it was Friday night at dinner time.  Can't wait to go back!",

There is usually a pretty long wait for a table if you come at peak times, so with a group it was hard to get in.  We decided to go by ourselves one night and grabbed seats at the Chefs counter by the bar. Highly recommended! It was a cool experience.

    "text": "After an exhausting day, we needed some good food. And lucky for us, Good Food on Montford lived up to its name! We arrived around 7:15PM and were told it would be about an hour to an hour and a half wait, which we were fine with since we read so many great reviews about this place. And the wait really was completely worth it!    The one thing that I ordered that I was not crazy about was my drink. I ordered the strawberry lavender margarita, because it sounded unique with the addition of lavender. While it tasted good, it was not worth $13, in my opinion. I much rather have spent the $13 on another dish and had more food. Because the food was THAT good.  So now, the amazing food: We ordered 5 dishes for 2 people. All of the dishes are tapas size, so they recommended 2-3 dishes per person. We ordered all of the food at once, but they staggered the dishes really nicely so that we never had too much food on our table. The first dishes to come out were the Pommes Frites and the Steamed Buns. After looking at the pictures on yelp, I knew I wasn't going to want to share the Steamed Bun, so we ordered 2 of that dish to curb any puppy eye begging from me to my husband. But my favorite dish ended up being the Pommes Frites. These are the best French fries I've ever had IN MY LIFE. I didn't even want to dip them in any ketchup because they were so good on their own. The truffle oil & parmesan cheese combination on them is incredibly delicious and addictive. Big big winner here. And the steamed buns were my second favorite. It is a must order as well. The other 2 dishes we ordered were the Gnocchi and Korean Beef. Both were excellent and flavorful! I can't wait to try more of the food here!  And since all of these dishes were so wonderful, we knew we couldn't leave without trying their desserts too. So we ordered the peach cobbler with homemade blueberry ice cream and cannoli cheesecake. Every bite of each dessert was heavenly!  You better believe you are missing out on some good food if you haven't been here yet. You may have to wait awhile for your table, but your taste buds will thank you!",

I had never heard of it but we decided to get it (and a Pot de Creme, just in case lol) WOW this thing was amazing, truly amazing! I don't even know how to describe it, it's just so light and fluffy. It really hit the spot. This has become one of my favorite desserts",

    "text": "We had an awesome dinner here after the game at Panthers stadium. There are many, great reviews about Good Food, and it definitely lived up to the hype. While it is expensive for tapas ($100 for 5 plates, 2 drinks, and 2 desserts for a couple), the food and service was exceptional. They don't take reservations FYI, and we had to wait 1 hour for a table Saturday night.   To start, I had a ginger Moscow mule, and it was very gingery and was really good, but definitely pricey. We started with the pomme frites, and wow they were amazing! For French fries just covered in truffle oil and Parmesan, they were fried and seasoned to perfection, definitely a must order. We also ordered a couple of stemmed buns with pork belly, and they were huge. The steamed bun was soft, fluffy, and not starchy tasting at all. The pork belly was tender, very flavorful, and not greasy at all. We also shared the Korean beef, which was cooked to a very nice medium rare and had a great spice flavor from the Korean spices and kimchi. It was served over crispy rice, which was very tasty and crunchy. Our final tapas was the gnocchi which had a lamb and pork thinly sliced throughout. The sauce was excellent, not too creamy, but smooth and flavorful with the pistachios. All of the tapas were good and I would definitely order them again.   To finish off dinner, we had the cannoli cheese cake and peach cobbler with blueberry ice cream. Both were excellent deserts I would definitely recommend. Overall, we had a great dinner here and I would highly recommend trying this unique tapas restaurant when in Charlotte.",

We ordered a little bit of everything and sampled not one but three desserts. Everything was delicious!!   We started with the beef carpaccio snd pomme frites. I loved the fried pickles on the carpaccio and the pomme frites were better than expected. Like several other reviews have mentioned...make sure you get an order!   For our meal, we decided on the Parmesan gnocchi, Garganeili and Pork carnitas. Each one was excellent but my favorites of the night were the Garganeili with the house made Italian sausage which was packed with so much flavor...and the pork carnitas with the pickled cabbage and queso fresco!!! Yummy!!!  For dessert we ordered the pot de creme (chocolate and expresso custard), the apple cobbler and the chocolate brownie with biscoff ice cream....all were so darn good!!! But my goodness that biscoff ice cream was heavenly.   Such a cool place, with excellent food. I look forward to my next visit.",

I've eaten at Good Food a total of THREE times as I had to wait it out to ensure consistency before providing my review given by a Food Service All Around Experience Snob such as myself.  My husband read about Good Food in one of those Free Charlotte magazines he picked up at HT. He decided to take me on our DateNight one month and to our surprise this place was PACKED, small & didn't take reservations which sorta threw me off but I decided to keep a clear mind and NOT JUDGE from that. We ended up finding seats at the bar and the bartender was extremely nice and explained the concept of shared plates. We jumped right in as we LOVE tapas style and are very familiar coming from BIG CITIES (Chicago and NYC) . We ordered a sleuth of items from mussels to salads to wine to cocktails I mean I lot of stuff and we didn't NOT enjoy any of the many items ordered. Like how often does this happen? So needless to say we enjoyed our Datenight at the bar and got over the chance to dine at a table.  The 2nd visit was the same and we even got there early in our eyes (6pm ish on Friday), we ended up at the bar again but the food was still good. My 3rd visit happened earlier this month (last week March 2,2016) as I took my neighbor to celebrate her 8th birthday (she is actually 32 but since her bday is leap year she has only had 8 birthdays so far :-)  We had a nice spread we started with the tempura broccoli with pickled jalapeno which was OK it lacked flavor such as seasoning in the breading or some additional pickled jalapeno which could've made it a perfect dish. Next we had the falafel which was super GOOD, my friend then went with the meat Ragu and rice stuffed cabbage (I don't eat meat/ land animals as I'm Pescaterian) which she enjoyed and I went with the Fresh CATCH & it was SOOOOOOOOO GOOD just PERFECT. My friend took a Fresh Catch to go after tasting mine and she was Soo full so she got it to go. For dessert we shared the carrot cake Twinkie which was AMAZING the cream cheese ice cream was undoubtably a perfect pair.  I'm sure to BE BACK",

The truffle chutney was outstanding with the cheese.  Gnocchetti was sumptuous with excellent sauce.  We were surprised at how good the Italian sausage was -- it was the favorite for two of us, while the gnocchetti was the favorite for the third of our party, followed closely by the rich and bacon filled potato gratin.  The steamed bun was a pleasant surprise. The server was engaging and knowledgeable.  The wine list was exciting and eclectic.

The bartenders took great care of us with FULL glasses of wine while we waited for our seat. Food is tapas style so we were able to order an eclectic mix of foods. My wife started with the green pea soup which was great. I had a salad and it was great but kind of a waste to get at this restaurant, should have been more adventurous. We tried the Korean Beef which I thought was excellent. A little too spicy for my wife but that's a personal thing. We had scallops which were seared perfectly. Our servers were very attentive and had good recommendations and thoughts on the menu. We'll definitely be back and recommend it to others.",

The servers here seem to very knowledgable, as well.    Some of my favorite dishes (so far) are the butternut squash soup, seared scallop w/ pumpkin risotto (yum!), the steamed bun pork belly, and the garganelli which features house made italian sausage.    They don't take reservations, so I prefer to go on a week night.  Can't wait to go back!",

The only downfall is that most likely you will be waiting for a while.  Luckily it was just dinner for 2 this night, and we immediately found a pair of seats at the bar.  The service was amazing and I think I would sit there again even if there was space in the dining room.  The star of the night was the steamed bun.  The pork was crisp, juicy, soft, and sweet all at the same time.  The green curry mussels came in a close second for me.  Two of the other dishes we ordered I would classify as \"just good\" - the falafels and the cavatappi.  I think the steamed bun and mussels set the bar too high.  We had a chicken dish that we didn't care for the flavor of, can't recall the name or how it was described.  I (solely, wife refused to participate) had the pot de creme for dessert.  Outstanding.  Not overly sweet so the True flavors shine.  Perfect dinner.",

    "text": "Good Food has ammazzzzing food! I can not gush about how awesome everything we ordered! From the scallops to the mussels there was nothing more a girls night out could ask for. The only problem we came across was the staff. We had a party of 5 in which two of the girls were running late, as it is on a busy Saturday night there was a wait in which the gentleman at the door told us 45 minutes. When the large party before us decided to leave our table came up sooner then that, in which the remaining two had not arrived yet. The 3 of us were standing there obviously anxious for them to get here, and the gentleman at the door kept making comments. \"I hope they get here soon.\" \"Don't want you to lose your table.\" \"OH, finally their here you can sit.\" In which he just pointed at the table we were standing next to. ONCE AGAIN, let me say it was a busy Saturday night, it was nice of them to hold the table an extra 10 minutes for the other two to arrive, but the comments were very unnecessary. Then once we sat down our waitress took our order, brought our drinks, and didn't return until she dropped the check off on our table. We did not see her throughout the meal and once the check was delivered and having a group of 5 women who were all ordering separately we wanted our check split. I know this is obnoxious for anyone in the service industry but it is something that you run into... at every restaurant! When she didn't return for an extended amount of time we wrote down what everyone ordered and split it ourselves! When she picked up the check we informed her what we had down she said \"thank you\" took then check and walked away. About 5 minutes later the gentleman from the door returned to our table with our checks and said that they do not split checks and that there was no way to do it in the computer.. and that we had to figure out how much to charge each card separately...  So to finish this review definitely go to Good Food for the food not so much for the service!",

    "text": "Upon our arrival, the first thing I noticed was how small the establishment was, but I actually found this to be somewhat endearing, and almost exclusive.  I found the wood and exposed brick to be appealing and homey.  We sat at the bar while waiting for our table, and within seconds it became obvious that it was unreasonably hot in the room.  It's not clear whether or not there was central air conditioning, but a hot summer's evening in Charlotte, NC requires at least the consideration of ceiling fans.  When we sat down to eat, we ordered the much anticipated almonds as well as a cheese plate.  The almonds were tasty if a bit oily, and a little over-smoked.  Marcona almonds have a delicate and subtle taste, and in my opinion, benefit from just a touch of salt and don't necessarily need a lot of extra flavors.  The cheese plate was reasonably executed, but the portions were tiny, even for a place that advertises small portions.  There were only 3 pieces of bread, which really doesn't make a lot of sense.  And I might add, all of the tables around us were receiving freshly warmed bread with some sort of olive-oil dip, and this never did materialize for our table.  Nevertheless, I was still feeling encouraged that a reasonably strong meal was on its way.  Our waitress took the extra step of asking us whether or not we were planning to share our plates with each other, and I made it clear that there were no plans to share.  We were expecting things to come out at the same time.  Which is why I was a bit confused when my husband's gnocchetti dish came out a full 15 minutes before anyone else's food, especially considering the fact that my sister and her husband ordered cold salads.  Why weren't the salads the first thing on the table?  The first course was delivered by a runner, and we didn't actually see our waitress again for at least another half hour.  The gnocchetti was okay, but drowned in a creamy sauce which totally overpowered what should have been light and fluffy potato pasta.  Next to arrive was my lamb tagine.  When I think of this Moroccan dish, I imagine tender lamb, braised until it is almost falling apart.  I received a small pot full of tough, chewy meat that was overseasoned and overly spicy.  Finally, the salads arrived, and my sister and her husband seemed reasonably pleased with them.  Next up was the wild mushroom dish my husband ordered.  This was essentially a chopped up mass of rubbery, flavorless mushrooms with extremely dull and muddled seasoning, and no visual appeal whatsoever.  We had envisioned a plate of whole or half mushrooms.  These essentially looked like sliced white or button mushrooms, with some dried herbs thrown on as an afterthought.    My seared scallop on beet risotto arrived in similar late fashion (no one asked us how our food tasted), and the scallop looked perfectly done.  Nice and golden and caramelized, as I was hoping for.  But one bite immediately overpowered my taste buds with fresh dill, and I was unable to taste the sweetness of the scallop that I had been craving when I ordered the dish to begin with.  The beet risotto, which should have been earthy and creamy, was a purplish mound of intermittently mushy and crunchy arborio rice, and after two bites I had had enough.  Even the potential drama of the dish from the purple risotto was lost in the overseasoning and overcooking.    My sister had the lobster fettuccini with chantilly cream and peas.  Surely, I thought, this dish should exhibit some richness and indulgence that I had so been craving when we sat down to eat.  It looked reasonably appealing in the dish, but one forkful of the pasta with a tiny bite of lobster once again revealed an overly creamy, flavorless mushy dish.  Bland and flavorless.  My brother-in-law had a salmon dish with a tomato and chick-pea sauce on the side.  I tried the sauce, which proved to be overpoweringly bright and acidic with tomatoes, and the chickpeas were undercooked to the point of near-crunchiness.    Finally, my sister's green curry mussels showed up.  I have to say that this was my favorite selection of the evening, although the bar was painfully low at this point.  The green curry was sharp and bright, and I could actually taste the coconut milk and curry.  The mussels were cooked correctly and were not fishy whatsoever.  This dish had me dipping my bread in the sauce.  The only knock on this was that it was served with small toast points, only 2 of them.  When my sister asked for more, after 20 minutes the runner showed up with 2 more tiny pieces of bread.  Seriously?  We tried 3 different desserts, all of which were reasonable.  All in all, I would have to give this restaurant a thumbs down, for uncomfortable temperature, awful service, and overpriced mediocre food.  Perhaps they should consider changing their name to \"So-So Food on Montford\".",

We started off with the meat plate and the cheese plate. They were pretty good, but honestly, I'll skip them next time. Next we got the green curry mussels, those were VERY good! Our final course was fried chicken over grits. Ours somehow came out under sweet potatoes, not a big disappointment, but it wasn't my favorite dish. The sweet potatoes were very bland and so was the chicken. Last was the pasta with homemade sausage..that, along with the mussels were my favorite. Overall..it was a great experience.

The dishes are well balanced and tasty every time.  Given that it's a tapas place you might expect some dishes to fall short.  And sometimes they have extraordinary touches that are entirely unexpected.  Like a drizzle of lemon oil on a delicious bowl of pea soup.  Desserts are also really great.

Good thing because they don't take reservations and apparently, they fill up pretty quickly...    I cannot think of one bad dish that we shared that night... I had the Korean Beef which was totally spectacular and served on top of crispy rice with a scallion kimchi... She ordered the truffle fries because she said she'd been craving them... One bite and I figured out why... They were light, crisp and but still managed to be filling... You could taste the truffle, but it wasn't overwhelming at all... A perfect complement... She also ordered the oysters... I don't eat those, but she said they were fantastic and I'm willing to take her word for it...   The server took quite a while to come back around... As I said, my friend came first and got the table, but it took about 20 minutes for her to come back to the table to get our drink orders after I arrived... That seems like a long time to me, especially when you already have a person at the table, so you know there's an active guest situation there...  The service picked up after the initial lull, at least... I'll definitely be back, though...  The parking can fill quickly if you don't come early and if you do come late, prepare for a wait...

We had the truffle fries, falafel, a pasta dish and shrimp and andouille. It was good. Nothing exceptional. I'd recommend it for something different but it wouldn't be my \"go-to\" restaurant. Our waiter was nice but wasn't super attentive (they were fairly busy though).   Overall, good food. Good experience. Ok service.",

    "text": "I live in New York City, and a client of mine took me here for dinner one night. I have to say, this is one of the best restaurants that I have been to-- ANYWHERE.   The drinks (I got some sort of Gin drink with egg white in it?) and wine list area great. But the food is the star. I can't remember EVERYTHING we got, but I cannot think of one thing that we got where I wasn't saying, \"Oh my GOSHHHH!\" every time I tried it.   Here are the things I can remember:  Cheese plate-- delicious Pomme Frites-- OH. MY. GAWD. Steamed Bun-- Delicious... very very good. However, the stand out dish for me was the mussels dish  (Green Curry, Coconut Milk & Cilantro). This is last meal of your life good. Like \"you are thinking about it when you leave contemplating how fat you'd appear to be if you went back after your work function and got 7 orders of it to go to your hotel room\" good.  The dessert, cappuccino, service, everything was top top notch and I've been to some of the best restaurants in NYC. To top it all off, the place is not even remotely pretentious. Friendly bar tenders, servers, even the manager/owner who knew the client I brought was talking us up the whole time. It's both laid back and upscale at the same time so you can put your elbows on the table and enjoy a good conversation while getting a great, upscale meal. That is, if you can fit anything else on the table along with all of the plates filled with delicious food.  I cannot WAIT to go back.",

Every carefully crafted dish was superior both in presentation and in taste. From the pomme frites to the Korean beef to the roasted shrimp arepas, seared scallops. Everything we tried was spot on.   The atmosphere is very tastefully decorated and although they were surprisingly busy for a Wednesday night, both the kitchen and wait staff had things very well under control.  Cannot wait to return to Charlotte as soon as possible to revisit Good Food on Montford. A very memorable experience.",

Place opens at 5:30 and I recommend you don't arrive much later than that as it gets PACKED, and its a pretty quaint dining area. Grabbed a beer on tap: small, but very good selection of local and popular non-local beers. The Korean beef was fantastic, but the star of the show here is the Steamed Bun. Think of a melt-in-your-mouth Bahn Mi, crafted by the hands of angels. It is THAT good. The pork belly is so tender and flavorful and that steam bun is criminally good. Hoisin adds a bit of sweetness and slight tang, and the pickled vegetables off-set the soft texture with a nice little crunch. Great idea, brilliantly executed. Next time, I might just order 5 and plow through them. Better prepare for the \"Oh are you expecting someone else?\" question...  But I digress; this place is really really good. Do yourself a solid and check it out.",

    "text": "\"Good Food on Montford\" is a pretty decent name for this place. \"Pretty Good Food on Montford\" must have been in the running as well.  I skipped lunch and ended up here early. But barely early enough. The wait here is ridiculous, I have found. We got there about 15-20 minutes after they opened and there was an hour wait. We ate at the bar, which was not a particularly bad place to eat, until later in the meal when other people waiting are ordering drinks over top of you.  Things I recall getting off of the menu: Charcuterie: Chicken liver was good. Generally pretty average. Potabella Mushroom Soup: Good, but about what you would expect. Parmesan Gnocchi: Ridiculously great food with some wonderful duck. The best thing I had there. Vietnamese Stuffed Quail: This should not last too long on the menu. It sounds great, but was so over-fried it may as well have been chicken. Korean Beef: It was OK. You probably should not order it, even if you love Korean beef. Seared Scallops: Not bad. I'm not a scallop fan, but this was pretty good. Once of the better things.  I think I got something else... but realistically, the Parmesan Gnocchi with duck was the only very memorable thing. The drinks were good, but for $160 for two people (after tip), all I thought was I have had better meals for quite less around Charlotte.   A little difficult to say if Asheville has destroyed my food expectations or not, but out of at least six things I tasted off of the menu, I only found one really good item. Other items were good, but were generally about as good as places half the price.",

Light with a bit of fruity sourness to it. Really could have eaten an absurd amount.  2. Smoked Lamb Belly Confit - the belly is rolled in to a wheel so every bite gets a perfect amount of fat along with the smoky beef and it's all very well accompanied by the lentils.  3. Arctic Char on Fennel  and Potatoes  - Textural contrast was excellent.  4. Gnocchi - Great softness to the pasta held together with cream and contrasted by crispy bacon.  5. Mussels in Green Curry - I'm a curry snob but the curry they used here, was nontraditional and extraordinary. There was a real ciTruesy sweetness to it.   We had at least 4-5 other things but these are the ones that really stood out to me.",

It was a Saturday night but the wait was surprisingly short though a majority of the tables had patrons. The only reason not to give this place 5 stars was the service. At times it seemed as if we were being overlooked by our waiter in regards to a long wait for our food, not checking in on us or providing us with refills timely. The hostess that seated us was also not the friendliest, tossing the menus on the table instead of handing them to us. Overall the food was good, atmosphere and parking/location were okay, not sure if we will return or not. What I did like was that we could walk right across the street after dinner and do some bowling.",

The Parmesan & truffle risotto might be one of the best things I've ever had, no joke it's that good. Their brussel sprouts are unlike any I've had, truly unique and amazing. The steamer bun with Pork belly was INCREDIBLE. The bun was so soft and light, it was like eating a delicious buttered pillow haha! The Parmesan gnocchi again was some of the best homemade pasta I've tasted to date.   Last but NOT least the pork tenderloin served schnitzel style with the poached egg on top was my FAVORITE. I was lost for words, so tender and so perfectly seasoned.",

Our waitress and the other staff ensured that at least one vegetarian plate was at the table at all times. We ate family style and had a great experience.   I believe we ordered nearly every dish on the menu. Some dishes were flawless, while others were a little less spectacular. Regardless, all dishes had at least one good aspect. The dandan noodles with pork cheeks, the steam bun, fried oysters, the falafel, the truffle fries, and the gnocchi with duck were by far the favorites. The sausage pasta that's been around all 10 years of their service was excellent but apparently really salty. The roasted beets were decent but lacked flavor. The fried chicken was mostly breading and very little chicken, but the bacon grits were delicious.   We ordered most of the dishes on the menu and one round of drinks, and our total was $260, just to give you a point of reference.",

From the outside, it's nothing flashy but a solid frame with floor to ceiling glass front windows. The interior is modern, contemporary and very tasteful. They nailed the minimalist and cozy ambiance. They have each table set and ready for your arrival.  I really like the small tapas plate concept. You can pick and choose various dishes to share with your partner. Awww, romantic. Tip: Get 2 steamed buns so you won't end up fighting over it; it is that delicious you each want your own. I'm going to make it my mission to try each item...the quail wraps and Korean beef were very flavorful. They focus on seasonal dishes using local and/or organic options. Fab. The wine selection was very good and the servers make great recommendations. Last, but not least was the dessert. They had the most fantastic blackberry ice cream (yes, it was a few seasons ago) paired with a cake or cobbler dish. Mmmm.  The service was fantastic! Just the perfect amount of attention balanced with privacy. The most perfect dining experiences are when you lose track of time, deep in conversation, eating fantastically prepared food, and dishes are each a work of art. You will get all of that at Good Food.   My favorite. Just wish they would accept reservations.",

I went with a group of 6 on a Friday and we were seated immediately. As long as you arrive within 30 minutes of opening you won't have to wait at all.  I recommend trying the pork belly bao (not too fatty), any fish dish, pomme frites, and parmesan gnocchi with rabbit (see photos). And of course, bring friends so you can try a little bit of everything!  ** Minus one star because they made a big fuss about separate checks. The waitress reluctantly allowed US to calculate each person's tab down to the included tip.  What if I don't want to pay for someone else's alcohol? I understand the concept of sharing but it should just be an option without question.",

The parking lots are also pretty small too, so finding a spot can take a minute.  I loved the Fig Smash cocktail - really yummy! but then I am a fig fanatic.   The dining room is loud but cozy. The plates are all small and share-able - really delish. I would have to call out the Steamed Bun, the truffle pommes frites, braised duck with fettuccine and the farfalle.  They don't take reservations, so you have to basically show up and put your name in.   I would definitely come back , but I think I will plan for less popular nights of the week. My last visit was on Friday and the place was crazy. I showed up early to meet a friend and put in our name for a group of 6- I sat at the bar and enjoyed some drinks while we waited for the table to be ready.   Special kudos to the server who gave us some of his \"secret sauce\"!",

Food: 5 stars- incredibly creative fresh and delicious (get their banana bread if they have it during your visit) Service: 5 stars- waitress was friendly and helpful, my glass was never empty and the table was never dirty Drink: definite 5 stars- try thier fig smash you will love it I will definitely be becoming a regular here.

Our server Gina was absolutely amazing! Friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  We started with a couple of cocktails, and I was a little disappointed in the pear fizz. When I order a $12 cocktail I want to taste a little alcohol. It had good flavor though. Decided to order a glass of wine for round 2.   The only thing I wouldn't order again is the cheese plate. With so many other delicious options on the menu, it just isn't worth the money for 3 small pieces of cheese. We impulse ordered it when they were out of our first choice. The pomme frites were delicious.   The Korean beef was just as good as everyone raves about. Perfectly cooked and the crispy rice cake added nice texture. The sauces on top were delicious. The gnocchi was another favorite. You can tell its homemade. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The sauce and crispy onions were delicious and different.  All in all it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back and try more from the menu!",

I like a place that will seat me for my party of five when I am the only one there. The waiter did not make me feel unwelcome at any point, and when one of our party did not show up, it was no problem. He was also very attentive!  This place is tapas style, you need to order approximately two items to equal a regular entree.  That showstealer for me was Korean style pork on a steamed bun with pickled vegetables. It was served like a taco, and it was scrumptious!  The sauce had many layers of flavor, and the steamed bum absorbed it perfectly.  While I enjoyed the plate of mushrooms, the oil was a little heavy handed.  For others at the table, the winner was the spring onion cream soup. One friend got it, and as soon as the other friend tried it, she ordered it for herself!  The dessert showstealer was a rich coconut cake with a meringue topping and a coconut cream. We all agreed at the table that was the best of the two desserts. The other one, a lemon marscapone basil cake, was a bit bland.    I would definitely eat here again.  Though I frequent the Starbucks around the corner, I have never been on this street before. It seems like there are lots of interesting restaurants and bars to try!",

My fave is the mushroom soup it's only place I'll have 2 Bowls in one night lol it's that good!!! Also a favorite go too is the gnocchi (flavors do switch up) they have great size bowls & encourage sharing.  So make an experience out of your time there! You'll get to know your server on a first name basis & you'll walk out full satisfied & feeling like you just had dinner at a good friends house only they're an amazing Chef    Go often & don't be afraid of the wait time!!",

We started with the Nashville hot chicken which was a sample from the menu for their new restaurant - it was awful. I've been to Nashville and had hot chicken which is why i wanted to try this dish, but it was just gross. It was like drinking oil as my boyfriend described it. We did tell our waitress who explained that's just how it's made. Oh well. We also had the gargenlli with the house made sausage which was delicious! Simple ingredients but really flavorful! We also had the salad with tabouleh which was good, nothing exciting though. At this point we were kind of done with the meal, but ended up getting the brownie dessert which was also really good. The brownie was not overtly sweet and balanced out really well with the biscoff ice cream. Overall - not impressed, but would consider giving it another chance since i did really want to try the lamb gnocchi and Korean beef.",

I loved the fresh thyme and fresh oregano. I thought the serving was too big for a tapas portion but the flavor was good. BUT THOSE MUSSELS?!? I dont even like mussels or curry and I'm trying to rearrange my schedule to get back to Charlotte JUST FOR THE CURRY MUSSELS! They were PERFECT! And the leftover curry sauce was great for dipping in their sourdough bread or even their truffle fries (also freaking amazing). Do yourself a favor and get the fries and the mussels!

Upon entering the restaurant, reception booth was empty, and no one, including bartender, waiters, manager, acknowledged us. That should have been a warning sign. We stood there waiting, because that's what you normally do upon entering a restaurant. Another group came after us, and just sat down without asking if we were waiting. A man who was wearing dirty pants and shirt finally came towards us. We asked him if we were supposed be sitting ourselves, and he seemed annoyed and said he was getting us a table. He sat us down at a high table by the bar, without asking if we preferred a regular table.   We ordered the steambun, korean beef, gnocchi and scallops. Here is a breakdown for you. Steam bun - please, if you can't make the \"bun\" part of the steam bun properly, better not to offer it at all. Korean beef - beef was good, but again it's hard to mess up a couple slides of beef. Didn't care for the rice at all.  Gnocchi - the taste of salt overpowered everything else. I wondered if the cap fell off the salt bottle Scallops - the ingredients just didn't go well together.   My overall impression of the restaurant is, they tried hard to implement a hip and trendy concept, but the execution of the menu items and the service did not line up with the concept.",

Waiter was nice and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  Overall, if we just wanted cocktails ($12 /glass) we might stop back in.

    "text": "Incredible on all counts. We went on a last minute recommendation from a friend while we were driving around looking for dinner. We had to wait, but no big deal.It was Friday night, we showed up at peak, and it was not as long as we expected. The decor was great. It was a smaller personal atmosphere with modern and rustic accents. The service from start to finish was EXCELLLENT. I had to wait at the bar to get drinks while we were waiting for a seat and the bartender comped a drink for our wait (which again was not that long). The tapas: They were all incredible and Korean Beef and the Country Fried Chicken were probably my favorite, but The Mussels and the Bun that was filled with pork (reminded me of Banh) mi were a close second. Everything was extremely rich, buttery, salty, and on *the upper end of spicy*. The atmosphere of the clientele was \"casual\" but very stylish. It was a bit pricey, but standard for the quality, service and ambiance.",

This is one of the busiest restaurant in the city. The service here is good, the staff is knowledgeable. The ambiance is upscale casual.   The cocktails (change seasonally) are ok the wine list is fair, nothing really to write home but good enough to try a couple.   The cheese plate had some very good stuff, though the portions were a bit small. The poached farm egg with root vegetables plate was well made, it was new on the menu as well. The fried chicken (new dish) was also very good - chicken coop good (Charlotte natives you know what I'm talking about). The dish you come for though, is the Asian style pork belly steamed bun. I would eat ten of those if it wouldn't give me a heart attack.   Now I'm not a dessert guy, but the desserts were ok. The best one is the cobbler - if you weren't full before you order it, you will be after.   If I was a millionaire I would eat here everyday, but again, I would have a heart attack after ten days due to all the pork belly I would have consumed.",

It's very small so expect to wait awhile on a weekend night. Our wait for 2 was 30 minutes but didn't get sat for almost 45. Luckily we went to the bar and got some drinks. I got a ginger mule and my mom got the Madison park punch. Both AMAZING but a tad pricey. We closed our tab prior to dining and the drinks with tip and tax was $35.   The food was spectacular. It is a tapas menu and they separate the dishes out in 5 different styles. \"Warm, chilled, pasta, sea and one more I can't remember the name. We got the pomme frites AMAZING, beef carpaccio was very very good, fried chicken and the steamed bun was superb. We had to wait quite a bit for the garginelli pasta but it was my least favorite of the whole dinner. We looked at the dessert menu but chose not to get anything.   Overall it was a great cute little place with really good food. Drinks were a tad pricey but they were amazing. Would definitely go again.",

We arrived around 7:30 pm on a Saturday and had about a 45 minute wait.  The wait seems to decrease after 9 pm. They don't take reservations so grab a drink and hang out on the comfy outdoor couches.   For drinks we tried Straight Outta Montford, the Mule, and the Montford punch. All drinks were flavorful and strong!  Tonight we had the gnocci and pasta dishes and both were excellent. We tried the pork carnitas for the first time and are fans. The fried chicken and grits was interesting and the chicken was perfectly cooked. I'm not sure tomato grits are my favorite, but the other flavors in the dish were yummy. My hubs had the steamed bun and said it was good, as always.   For dessert we split the new cinnamon roll dish. The brown butter ice cream was ridiculously good, but it was difficult to eat the cinnamon roll and get to the apple pie filling stuff underneath. The cinnamon roll was kind of hard and we asked for a knife to cut it up. Our waiter said it was the first night on the menu and that they were still tweaking the cinnamon roll recipe to try and make it easier to eat.",

It gets  ist fast, so you have to come at a good time, but the service is always good and the food is always spectacular! Chef Schreiber's small plate menu is constantly changing with the season using only local and organic ingredients -- and you can definitely tell, as the food tastes incredibly fresh. Good food is a good place to go out with friends in Montford or just have a nice date night.  I recommend the star of the menu: the steamed bun, which is a five spice rubbed pork belly dressed with hoisin and pickled vegetables. This pillowy bun is going to be a hit at the table so I suggest ordering more than one. The Poached Farm Egg is also really good, which is made with root vegetables, maitake mushrooms, and root juice. The flavor pairings in this dish are really nice and a good start to the evening. Lastly, I am obsessed with the braised duck gnocchi, which comes with greens, toasted pecans and is covered in a warm acorn squash puree. The gnocchi is nice and fluffy, and tastes very savory with the squash and duck.",

Here is the food rundown on what I ordered:  Asian salad - this was a nice green salad with a clean fresh taste...a bit of soy and sesame as well as a nice thick sauce on the side.   Poached egg with root vegetables - this was outstanding. It's True that a poached egg makes anything better! There is something about the combination of the crunchy veggies, the poached egg and the beet sauce. Delicious.  Steamed Bun - very tasty, nice soft bun with savory pork and nice pickles veggies.  Total bill with two martinis AND tip was $61.00, which was very reasonable for the quality of food. I will definitely be back next time I am in Charlotte.",

I have taken several friends there over the years and successfully converted but unfortunately quality I believe is going down gradually and tonight was the final straw for me.   Steamed bun which is their staple was below average. Bun was dry, pork belly wasn't tender and found a hair halfway through.   Below average Fettuccine.  Average service from a 'cold' bartender who couldn't even pretend to hear my feedback. Overall just a below average night. Didn't feel welcomed one bit. Aren't bartender supposed to have some personality or guess only to people he knew!  Well glad finally got to this point where I can finally say I am done with place instead of feeling disappointed Everytime.",

    "text": "I had an absolutely amazing dining experience at Good Food on Monfort.  I was on a trip without a rental car, and this was worth every penny I spent on an Uber to get here from my hotel.  First off the staff are first rate all the way through.  I was well taken care of in a friendly and welcoming waitress who made great recommendations and explained any menu item I had a question about.  The manager was involved in running the floor and made sure that everything was going well throughout the restaurant.  Now let's talk about the most important thing, the food.  The meal was simply amazing.  I ate way more than I should have and had three very unique and delicious dishes.  I started with the steamed pork bun which was first class.  The flavors were very traditional and the bun was steamed perfectly.  It was much bigger than a regular steamed pork bun so it would be good for sharing.  I then moved to the Prince Edwards Island Mussels.  This was served in a green curry coconut sauce that was amazingly flavorful without being too hot or spicy.  The flavors of the sauce were amazing and made the perfect backdrop for the steamed mussels that were meaty and out of this world.  Now, this is where I should have stopped but the dinner next to me was from Italy and he could not stop raving about the Garganelli.  Now when an Italian is raving about a pasta dish, you really should try it so I did.  I understand why he was such a fan.  The flavors in the Garganelli were fresh and bursting with complexity.  The sausage and the pasta were paired beautifully with the slightly sweet tomato sauce.  Mmmmm, it really was great.  I have been contemplating a trip back to Charlotte just to do a food tour because of this restaurant.  I was lucky to be eating on a Tuesday night and was able to get a table.",

We ended up ordering the Bahn Mi, Falafel, Truffled Fries, Southern Farmhouse Cheese plate, Charcuterie, and Garganelli.  We sampled a wide range of food and it was all delicious.

The atmosphere was intimate yet not awkward, the food was unique, and the server was personable. However, nothing about the food made me scream \"THIS is why I'm here!\"   My two favorite dishes of the night were the Morocco chicken sausage and the pork belly arepa. Both had great flavor, and had they been the only things I ordered, I probably would've given this restaurant five stars. The pommes frites, garganelli, triggerfish, and peach cobbler I could have done without. Their presentations were all great, I just needed an extra it factor in the flavors. Ordered the cheese plate and was given no explanation on types of cheeses...thanks!  In all, the menu and two of the dishes enticed me enough to warrant my return. Hopefully next time to some great food on Montford.",

Had I just had the Korean Beef and Garganelli  I would have given 5 stars but the Gnocchi was decent and the Peach Cobbler was terrible. The Cobbler crust was hard as a rock and the ice cream melts before you can even eat it.   This place is a definite must on your food journey through charlotte just skip the Cobbler and Gnocchi if you go.",

We went on a Thursday night around 6 and it was busy but we were seated immediately. If you're on a date or just catching a drink with a friend there are plenty of 2 seater tables in the middle of the restaurant or you can pull up to the bar. But if you have a bigger group, 4+, there are plenty of bigger tables too. The prices are ideal but be warned ... the portions are small. If you are super hungry be prepared to buy 2 or 3 dishes at least. Our waitress was super sweet and extremely knowlegable about all the dishes and drinks. The dishes are perfect for people who can't make up their minds and want to try it all. We tried 8 different dishes and 2 desserts. We got the Southern Farmhouse Cheeses, the Arugala, and the Beef Carpaccio for starters. We split the sauteed mushrooms, Gnocchi, Korean Beef, Pork Carnitas, and the catch of the day. No complaints on any of the dishes and they were great for sharing. For dessert we got the coconut cake and the cheesecake. AMAZING. We will definitely be going back. We also bought a bottle of Malbec and sipped on the BEST sambuca I have ever had.",

We went on a Saturday evening, and we were told an hour wait (as expected), so we popped over to Duckworth's for some drinks to pass the time. After killing some time, we went back to Good Food, only to find out that my name had been crossed off the list. Wait, what?!   I had given the host my cell number before we left, and no one had called. It turns out the host wrote my phone number down incorrectly. We were seated very quickly after that with a round of free drinks. Nice touch!   Our waiter was excellent, and had a great sense of humor. Some of the items we sampled included the mussels, sweet pea soup, steamed bun, quail lettuce wrap, poppy seed cake, and brownie. All were phenomenal, but I think describing some of the dishes as tapas or small plates is a misnomer. The portions were all ample to serve as individual entrees. Our waiter did note though that some past patrons have shared the soup. Nope. We had also debated about getting the brownie versus the twinkie for dessert, and our waiter definitely steered us in the right direction because the Biscoff ice cream was divine.",

My husband and I went on a Friday evening and the wait was just over an hour, but they were great about taking our phone number and suggesting we walk around or stop in somewhere for a drink while we waited. We popped next door to Braswells (tasty Georgia Peach mule) and waited for our call. We went back to Good Food on Montford when our table was ready and had an amazing meal with excellent service. I would highly recommend the Canvasback Cabernet - it's smooth and a perfect pair for the tastiness of the food. The plates are small..made to be shared. We shared (and loved) the arugula salad, squash soup, grilled shrimp, red snapper and Gnocchi. It was MORE than enough food, but it was all so delicious we had samples of each and eagerly waited for the next plate of deliciousness to arrive. Jessica, from the bar, was our server and she was awesome. She knew how to course our meals so we didn't have more than one plate at the table at a time. The atmosphere, the food and wine and the service were on point. I wouldn't say it would be great place for a group larger than 4. I would say 100% go to Good Food on Montford!",

I kinda like the fact that this place has been able to maintain their individuality as well as some inkling of a culture too.  It's tough to find places like this that can hang on to any of those precious gems, but you can see why when you've experienced it here.  Super crowded, expect a wait even if you show up early.  The restaurant's interior does an admirable job accommodating the queue of people, but it sure feels crowded when you're inside.  It also makes the place feel stuffy, loud, and quasi-forced and awkwardly intimate.    It's good, but the details for me were off a bit.  The waiter was fine, but seemed distracted.  Took forever to get our first drinks - which is a cardinal sin in my book.  The food was good, but didn't knock my socks off and left me feeling a bit underwhelmed by the execution, rather than its potential.  I'd come back, but sure would love to see some competitors pop up to distract me from doing so.",

I have been desperate to check them out but my husband isn't one for tapas so we never made it a priority.  This past Friday I was able to enjoy my tapas in peace because I dined with three other ladies that were more than willing to try everything!  It was perfect!!  We arrived on Friday around 7:30 and were seated within about 30 minutes, which isn't bad considering they don't take reservations.  The waitress was super helpful in guiding us through the menu and gave us some suggestions.  Some of the plates are really best for 2 people and others were enough for the 4 of us to share.  We tried so many different things I don't even know where to start.  I will just break it down dish by dish:  Broccoli Raab--Very good, refreshing, flavored well, served chilled, not too bitter Arugala--Strawberries, pine nuts, and goat cheese...can you even go wrong? Cheese plate--Meh.  I mean blue cheese made an appearance, really?  Come on. Falafel--Scrumptious...4 little falafel nuggets.  Left me panting for more..so good. Risotto--Not sure what flavors were combined to make this yummy goodness but it was on point  Gnocchi--With RABBIT.  Yup, I ate rabbit.  First time ever folks.  The gnocchi was excellent.  The rabbit was tender and flavorful.  It was not doubt gamey but blended well with the other flavors.  It was a table favorite.  Steamed Bun--This one has the most hype around it but it wasn't necessarily our favorite.  The pork was so tough and the flavors were ok but it wasn't THAT great.  Mussels--My first time trying Mussels!  I don't have anything to compare these to but the others were loving these mussels.  They were in a green curry sauce and they were served with soft, warm, naan.  We all started dipping the bread in the sauce afterwards...and we even ordered more naan.  It was very good!!  Pork tenderloin--Another group favorite..so tender, full of flavor, served with a soft piece of cornbread.  Very good!!  We wrapped up our pigfest by grubbing down a brownie served with biscoff icecream.  The brownie was warm with chocolate chips...it was thin, not very moist, just okay in my opinion.  The icecream was very creamy.  We licked the plate, don't let me fool you.  Overall--great experience.  Atmosphere is loud and crowded but energizing.  I love the hustle in this place.  People are eating well and are satisfied!  Prices are a little high but the quality of food makes it worth it.  I'll be back no doubt!",

My friend and I enjoyed Gnochhi, Steamed Bun, Mussels and Halibut.  Everything was delicious.  Excellent service, they didn't rush us through the meal.  I wanted to lick the plates clean.  We arrived at 5:30 on a Monday, right when it opened.  No wait.  I understand it's very hard to get in on the weekend, so I will try to go again early weekday.  Thanks for an awesome meal!",

I am happy to revise my review for Good Food to declare the food became Gooder. :) I have been a couple times in the last year and the food has been very delicious and the service has been good. The mushrooms side are delicious and I've enjoyed catch of the day and gnocchi tremendously. My friend Rachel loves the falafel too.   I only dock a star because I wish that they took reservations since it's always packed because of the excellent Yelp reviews. You really have to get there AT 5:15 before they open at 5:30 if you don't want a 1-2 hour wait. I've only had one time when we were able to walk in at 6 because it was really rainy on a Friday. If they had Open Table or another reservation system we would actually go a lot more often.",

I tried 1 chilled small plate - The mixed green salad with parsnip puree, and two warm small plates - 1. sauteed mushrooms and 2. PEI Island mussels with green curry, coconut milk & cilantro. They were all very good. The mussels with green curry with cilantro dazzled me. It made me want to have a bite of Jasmine rice with it though. But I had the slices of flat bread with it instead. The wine I had was a California Cabernet $9 a glass and it was really good too. I can sleep well tonight.",

It's also farm to table (I think...) so the menu changes.  We had gnocchi (pillowy potato goodness),  mussels (these suckers were HUGE!), charchuterie, and cheese plates (the jellies were DIVINE), shrimp and sausage (personal favorite dish!), a steam bun (no words to describe the light and fluffy bun filled with a sort of korean bbq flavored meat), desserts a sinful brownie and a cobbler.  I'm missing some dishes, but IT DOESN'T MATTER - WHY AREN'T YOU EATING HERE YET?!? We also had specialty drinks a blackberry bramble and margarita, with ports and tawny with desserts.  The table shared some wines - great selections even for one of my more discerning wine friends ;-) We had a few bumps through the meal - one being they are so busy there was a lag in the food coming out.  No one minded as soon as we had each first bite.  And a minor snafu with the tawny - we got a port instead but was quickly corrected.   they were able to accomodate our large party by spiltting us up but keeping us next to each other.  Bathrooms have a long wait, as there is only 1 for each sex (both are unisex, if you don't mind sharing with the gross boys). It was a pricey bill and totally worth every bite,  every minute.  They rolled this stuffed turkey out of there very happy!",

My favorites include the falafel, the Korean beef, and the gnocchi. We've brought out-of-town foodie friends here before and they were blown away. A must to try when you're in Charlotte if you're into high-quality, high-end food. It's not cheap, though, when you get carried away with wanting to try a myriad of amazing little dishes...if you don't exercise some restraint, it does eventually add up!

The lovely hostess for our Charlotte trip suggested going to Good Food as she and her husband had never been there before either. The menu sounded okay and the prices looked good.  The area was definitely a bumpin' night life scene with a pretty nice looking bowling alley across the street which was filled with people drinking and playing cornhole outside. Anyway, so, here's my breakdown of Good Food:  - Tapas style, but larger portions (2 dishes should MORE than suffice your appetite!) - Not too expensive (around $10 a dish depending on what you get) - I tried the gnocchi, salmon & pomme frites - all delicious! - THE SAUCES ARE ON POINT HERE. All of our different dishes had an excellent sauce that could be engulfed all by itself. - My drink was the Blackberry Bourbon Smash - super strong, borderline tasted like cough syrup, but I didn't hate it! I actually quite enjoyed it. - Soothing ambiance, nice decor, good & attentive service  Thoroughly enjoyed my experience here with superb company!",

We were all chomping at the bit to order each item that caught our attention (and trust me there were plenty). Their eclectic selection of tapas style dishes made for a pleasurable tasting experience. All of their flavors blended well together with none of them overpowered the other. It was a True show of their chef's vision. After all was said and done, the three of us were fully content.

    "text": "Finally made it out for an early dinner at Good Food. Can't believe it has taken me this long to check it out so I can write this review. Seeing as how this is one of Crown Town's more popular spots, the time was nigh to get in and sample the fare. A small, and plain building. Not too much going on inside. Just tables, booths, high-tops, and bar seating. Such close quarters that the aromas from the kitchen fill the dining area and inhabit your clothes. Not a bad characteristic.   First off, I have to express my love for these guys having Northcoast's Scrimshaw Pilsner on draught. Not a common tale for most places in town. This alone sets the bar apart from the rest. I can recognize that tap handle from anywhere....5/5 for this.   Ordered a smattering from the menu.   Cheese plate: 4/5. Camembert, bleu, honeycomb, fig spread and two others I can't recall. Served with grilled bread. No combination that was undesirable.   Falafel: 3/5. Rather plain, and the greek yogurt on top seemed to add to the plainness. 5/5 for presentation, though.   Pork Bun: Unreal. 5/5. Perfect texture, flavor and presentation. I was absolutely thrilled.   Corn Rissotto: 4/5 Sweet, and wholesome. Nothing over the top, but just right. A rather large portion, too.   Gnocchi: 5/5. Just perfect. Amazing flavor and all of the mushrooms were wonderful. I didn't want it end. The addition of the chicken was fine, but could have gone without.   Dessert: Apple cobbler with seasonal ice cream 3/5. Just nothing groundbreaking here. Presentation was fine, flavors were fine, but just didn't seem to have that special element.   We made it in at 5:40, right after they opened. I would emulate this again. Nice having an early dinner and missing most of the crowd. Service was incredible and so fast. Very knowledgeable about the menu.   Very much looking forward to returning!",

    "text": "If you haven't been to Good Food, you have to try them at least once.    We went very hungry, and shared six dishes between the two of us.  Here's what we had, in order of our favorites -  5/5 - Pappardelle with lamb cheeks - This is one of the best dishes I have EVER eaten.  The mint was a perfect complement to the absolutely melt-in-your-mouth lamb.  And the pappardelle was perfectly cooked and went well with the lamb. I almost ordered a second one of this dish, but held myself back so I could try some other things.   5/5 - Korean beef - If you like spicy food, this is one you need to try.  The beef was tender and very flavorful, and the rice cake was crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside.  I savored every bite.  5/5 - Beets - I'm not a beet fan, but my hubby is.  This was made with what appeared to be pureed beets, sliced beets, and goat cheese.  He said it was one of the best beet dishes he'd ever had.  4/5 - Gnocchi with chicken sausage - The gnocchi were small, soft little pillows. The chicken sausage was thinly sliced and nicely spiced.  The mushrooms were small, thin, and very flavorful.  The Parmesan sauce was a little too heavy for me, though, and I'm not a fan of peas.  3/5 - Scallops with couscous - The scallops were perfectly cooked, but I wasn't fond if the couscous.  It was flavored with red peppers, overpowering the dish.  I would have preferred polenta or grits to couscous.  3/5 - Pork bun - I heard this one was one of their best dishes, but it was my LEAST favorite.  We sliced it in half, and my side of the pork was quite fatty and inedible.  It was also too sweet for my taste.  Service is efficient, and multiple servers watch over your table.  The dishes are delivered quickly, too, so eat up!  I'm glad I read other reviews, because we got there right at 5:30, and the restaurant was completely filled up by 6:15.  There are more two-tops than four-tops, so if you are going with a group, you absolutely have to get there early if you don't want to wait an hour or more.  And the only place to really wait is outside (other than the bar, which is usually mostly seated with other diners).  In terms of the price, I thought they were very reasonable.  All of these dishes--and two beers--totaled only $76.  Not bad for the quality of food!  If you like a variety of flavors, Good Food is one to try!",

    "text": "Food is...food. It's pretty and mostly tasty, but it's not new and trendy anymore. Nothing pops or wows. And certainly not worth the price. (Tapas, tapas, tapas.) And the utter complete inability and refusal to split checks baffles me. I used to serve. I know what a pain it is. But it's a necessary evil. And one would think, since the servers don't have to split checks, that they'd be happy and more accomodating. No. Not so. Rude. Snotty. Bothered. Arriving with food we didn't order. \"You seriously didn't order this?\" Um...no. And I know it's tapas, but having someone's order come out 30 minutes later is...just bad.  If you're really into tapas and are willing to pay for it, there are so many places that are better. If you wanna' go to someplace just for the sake of it's trendiness...well, this is it. For now.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Good Food!  Great service every time we go and there's only been one dish that I didn't rave over (Short Ribs - I make them better at home).  The Steamed Bun and Mussels are an absolute must!  This is by far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  My only complaints revolve around the no reservations policy.  First, they closed the entire restaurant for a private event on a night we had planned in advance to go on.  We luckily found out through word of mouth, but had we not, I would have been highly upset.  Taking reservations would have solved this problem as I would have known at the time of planning.  Secondly, they DID take reservations on Valentine's Day.  Most regulars, like myself, would assume that they don't take reservations, and people were showing up without a place to sit.  I think the policy should remain consistent regardless of the date.  Luckily we went over the weekend and it was our Nanny that was left eating at the bar despite arriving shortly after 5PM.",

    "text": "In the top 5 best restaurants in Charlotte. A couple of stumbles on my visit kept them from getting 5 stars, but you can sense they are typically great. Also, a couple of flavor profiles did not deliver like I thought they would.  The Good:  - First, the restaurant. Incredibly cozy, perfect lighting, ambiance, all the touches in here are amazing. A lot of thought went into aesthetics and it shows. From the curb appeal to the restrooms, it's well thought out and well done. I probably would have put a knee wall between the lower tables and the bar height tables, but I did get to check out a lot of shoes.  - The menu, very well thought out, covers a wide range of both techniques and origins of products. The only thing missing for me was more shrimp or other crustaceans  - Lettuce wraps very well balanced, great flavors, perfect  - Smoked Salmon just right blend of oil, capers, seasoning. The egg mixture was ridiculously awesome  - Steamed bun in thought was very cool. The bread was perfect. I was expecting a bigger flavor experience though. The veggies gave a nice crunch but almost negated the softness of the bread.  Cool item (maybe being a little picky).  - Carbonara great flavor, but was looking for raw egg yolk.  - Ramen was beautiful and tasty, although a little light in flavor given the bbq pork.  I added a little salt and it ate very well.  The Bad:  - Service, our was not engaging at all, but we could see others had much better service. Hostess was much more attentive to us than our server. This was the biggest disappointment.  - Goat cheese and pear salad. The salad was really small but the mixed greens were really big with just a smidgen of pair. Ate poorly and struggled to get all ingredients in every bite.  Micro greens would have been much better. - Falafel, my 4th time having a falafel and by far the worst. The Greek yogurt had so much cilantro it killed everything else. Did not enjoy  - Chocolate dessert (can't remember name) was too gritty. Texture was not enjoyable.   We will go back again and again, but will make sure to get a better server. We saw the great ones, it just wasn't ours.  I would also just go back, drink a glass of wine and soak up the ambiance; truly awesome.",

We were seated right away, and the waiter was attentive and informative about the menu selections since it was our first time. Though we have had tapas before he explained the process and how many we should order per person since everything on the menu is in small plates. Everything we had was great, the korean beef was amazing, as well as the pork bun. The truffled fries were out of this world, some of the best I have ever had.I do not eat seafood, yet my fiance does and he had the seafood plate of the night that he enjoyed very much. The drinks were creative and fun, I especially enjoyed my beat cocktail- Yes actually the root veggie infused vodka cocktail! The food, service and space is great! Just get there early!

The food was great; we tried nearly every dish on the menu and the only things not to our liking was the severe amount of fat on the pork belly--both in the bun and in the wrap, and the fries were waayyy too salty; unedible. The gnocci was great, but the sausage pasta was by far the best thing we were served. The mussels were also amazing and there were lots of them!! Sometimes the service was slow...but we only had to ask for one water refill. My boyfriend had a glass of wine, as did our friend...they both enjoyed but I can't tell you what kind it was.  All in all, we would go back...but not for a full meal. For what we had, it was $175.00, and for the amount of food we ate (we only took 2 small leftover containers home), that was exceptionaly expensive.",

    "text": "Thanks to yelp, we went to this place since it was close to south park mall. What a good find! From the outside it is like a hidden gem.   Inside we were promptly greeted and seated. Our waitress was helpful and told us what to expect with small plates and large plates. We ordered the green mussels, scallops, morracan chicken and the chilled noodles for small plates. Everything was delicious, the mussels and the scallops were the best in my option but I'm biased since I love seafood. The mussels were cooked perfectly, although they did have sand in them. Scallops also were perfectly cooked. The chilled noodles came out next and it reminded me of Asian style noodles served cold. There was just enough pork to give it some flavor. The moracan chicken was lightly fried and served with chickpeas under it. A bit sweet but still delicious. We chose the  Grouper for the large plate. It is served with new England chowder. The grouper itself was cooked just right and tasted great. The chowder however was extremely salty. We finished it regardless.   For dessert, we chose the upside down peach With vanilla ice cream, it was a great mixture of flavors in my mouth. The sweetness was just right and the cake was so soft moist with a slice of peach on top. we savored every bite. Delicious in every culinary sense.  We will be back!",

    "text": "After hearing that GFOM had been named a semi-finalist for the James Beard award for Best New Restaurant, I knew I had to act on an acquaintance's recommendation and try it out.  It was not \"perfect,\" but it was very, very good.   There were two of us and we arrived at about 8:15 on a Thursday; by serendipity alone were we able to get a parking space - and a table for two without waiting.  The waitress commented on the fact that the servers would bring out everything \"as soon as it was prepared.\"  I think this is partly a pretty convenient way to keep bratty, moneyed folks from trying to arrange their experience -just so-., but also keeps anything from coming out unintentionally tepid.  Coming out first for us was a plate of (two?) cold, grilled artichokes with morels, parmesano reggiano and mache.  This was a spectacular dish, with the morels and artichokes on such a level that their flavor they matched the intensity of the parmesan.  It made the next dish, a tasty one in itself, seem muted in comparison.  Second was an arugula salad with goat cheese, pine nuts, fresh & dried strawberries and a balsamic that reminded you of subtly very good wine.  Everyone is bound to have a salad plate somewhere,  but this made the most of it.  Everything tasted very fresh and nothing was overpowering, with the arugula well- but not overdressed with balsamic.  Third was a cheese plate, which I have to omit from how I viewed the place.  There was a very soft cheese, a semi-firm and a blue, garnished with a port-soaked fig, truffle chutney and fresh honeycomb.  If you're a cheese person, I'm sure you'll love it.  I discovered through the plate that I wasn't.  The honey and fig were predictably delicious, the truffle chutney less so.  The pork bun was next.  I'm a bit spoiled by the buns by the Momofuku empire in NYC, but this bun was -not- worth the $10 that GFOM charges for it.  The hoisin was watery, the pork was good but maybe slightly overcooked, and the five-spice used in such a way that left the meat tasting slightly of cough syrup.  My suggestion to this place would be to make smaller buns, put two on a plate, drop the five-spice and pull the pork belly a tiny bit sooner.  Fennel soup came after.  We could barely taste the fennel, but we didn't care.  This soup had cream and probably pureed potato, was perfectly seasoned and was a welcome end to the savory courses, right down to the bread-and-tomato garnish on top.  We got a chocolate pot de creme and a warm cherry cobbler for dessert, and those two desserts combined could've likely satisfied four people in all.  As great of a way to bookend the meal as the artichokes were to open it.  Service was satisfactory if not particularly noteworthy, and since we didn't buy drinks I'm not terribly surprised.  If you have a date who loves good food and doesn't mind a noisy venue (or risking a bit of a wait), GFOM lives up to its name.",
