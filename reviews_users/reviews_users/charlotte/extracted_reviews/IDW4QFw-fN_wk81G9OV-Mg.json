I'm not sure why one $ is listed because a meal and a drink will run you above $10. So it's a bit pricey for what you are getting, but I can't find noodles as good anywhere else. I always get the Pad Thai noodles with beef. I've tried some of the american dishes as well but I always go back to my favorite. Definitely give the place a try",

She was not disappointed. The whole building smells incredible as soon as you walk in. With unlimited choices of combos being able to add any protein to any noodle dish or salad is great. Great local art on the walls, and a general cozy feel.  You order your food, get a number ala Showmars or McAllisters. They bring it out, very happily. All the workers genuinely seem happy, which is rare.  Great spot for lunch, although might be a bit pricey but for the quality, as well as quantity (usually 2 lunches worth) it is well worth a visit to this once ghost town of a road as construction all but shut it down for almost a year.  Something for everyone, even veggies, you're missing out for not having been here.",

I bought a few Groupons for this place since any carb is a friend in my book and was excited to see what it was all about. I love the variety and how you can get Asian, Italian, American style dishes and add protein for only $2 and some change. I went with the Chicken Pad Thai since I'm an Italian girl and wanted a break from anything involving oregano and garlic. It was tasty (but not authentic pad thai like you would get at a thai joint) and a HUGE portion. I had a bowl for dinner then had leftovers today so even though it comes to about $9 a meal, it really can be two meals. They were quick with my order and it was only a 5 minute wait for carry out. And they have the big, clear to go cups (think Starbucks), I don't know why but those make me happy and any place that has those gets brownie points from me. All in all, a great place to check out if you're hungry and want something satiating.",

The concept is a bowl of noodles and you can pick how you want them, Italian, Asian etc etc. with add-ons like chicken or meatballs etc.    I got the Spicy Asian Chicken bowl and my noodles were over done and the sauce was like peanut butter mixed with water...weird texture and flavor.  BUT my friend got the chicken pad thai and he couldnt finish it so I polished it off for him.....delicious!!!     I will go again and try more things on the menu because why would I just go here for pad thai when I can get the best pad thai in Charlotte at the Thai House??  I wish I could give 3 and a half stars because even though it is a little pricey (16 bucks for two people WITH a bogo coupon???), the portions are pretty large, you could easily split a noodle bowl with someone.

Our lives were a little less fulfilling without Wild Noodlez.  When I moved down to Charlotte and stumbled (and I literally mean stumbled, I fell on the curb walking there) across this place, it was like the sun began shining on my life again. I decided to wait until my gf came down for the summer to take her there. Needless to say, she was game the second she heard the title.  The place is a little bland. It didn't give me what I NEEDED. I feel like the menu OD'ed on different ethnic foods. I was simply looking for outrageous meals that include noodles, not so much just pad thai or pasta.   I'd like to see a little less seafood and ethnicity when I check out the menu. The food is still good and serving beer (thumbs up)  Check it out if you are looking to try something new.  LBD scale- 6. Could be great with some minor menu touchups.",

    "text": "Usually one to avoid the chain restaurant or any place that screams concept, I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful experience I had this evening at Nothing But Noodles on Elizabeth Avenue near CPCC.   After a very long week of work which ended in a very long Friday, my husband and I wanted a quick and painless dinner so after seeing a coupon in one of the weekly mailers (the mailers that usually sit on the counter until the coupons are expired) we decided to run out for a \"buy one get one free\" bowl of noodles.  We both ordered the rice noodles with peanut sauce and split some pot stickers.  The service was fantastic.  The cashier was very nice without being saccharine even offering to explain the menu and ordering process.  The restaurant was impeccably clean with a sanitation score of 101.5 and not a spot of dirt anywhere.  Even the back of house (although there is really no back of the house as the kitchen is fully visible) was shiny and orderly.  Someone on staff was cleaning the entire time we were there.   After we grabbed our drinks and sat down a server/bus person brought out our pot stickers.  We ate a couple and then started on the noodles.   The noodle portion was enormous with a flavorful homemade sauce and fresh vegetables.  A must have is the Key Lime pie.  It has a great crust and although the flavor is obviously key lime the creamy pie does not leave you with a perpetual pucker.  We noticed that they also offer homemade cotton candy for the kids which along with the other very kid friendly menu options, non-smoking atmosphere, unobtrusive music and pleasant lack of TVs' makes this a very family friendly restaurant.  All of that aside it was the customer service and attention to detail that made our experience truly remarkable.  The owner of the establishment was present and working at closing on a Friday night.  He takes pride in his restaurant and has obviously passed that on to his employees.  It is really refreshing to know that a business owner cares.   Thank you Todd and the rest of the staff at Nothing but Noodles for an unexpected pleasure.  You really turned what was supposed to be a quick bit to eat into a great evening out.",

My youngest daughter had been here once, loved it and wanted to go back.  She had received a free kids meal through her school and so I reluctantly went here, thinking that I'd survive the meal and then step into the delicious world of Elizabeth Creamery next door for a little ice cream.  Well, I have to say that the margherita noodles were really good.  Big portions like everyone else on Yelp has said.  I added three veggies for $1 and they seemed fairly fresh - broccoli, squash, carrots.  My wife got the chicken pad thai noodles and True to form, the Yelpers who said it's pretty good, were right.  The kids had buttery pasta - their drinks were free, which was a nice surprise.  Noodles were a bit too buttery - when I tried to pick one up, it moved all around like a slippery eel, and it ended up jettisoning across the restaurant.    Staff was extremely friendly.  They even had a few interesting beers next to the usual Lite this and Lite that.  And they were under $4 (thank you).  Wouldn't come here on a regular basis but it definitely beats taking the kids to fast food joints like McRib's and it's a nice change of pace from pizza places.  Big shout out to Yelper reviews.  Once again, they steered us right and the items we ordered all turned out to be very good.  xxxoooxxxooo fellow Yelpers!",

So I've been forced to live off peanut butter & jelly sandwiches & I didn't wanna write about that. My case is a special one, I generally have to borrow a few McDolla's to enjoy a meal from the McDollanaire menu. I know you would appreciate my review of the uber delicious McRib and it's saucy, mystery meat but how many times can you (re)write about it? Don't answer, it was rhetorical.  Any who, I had a few extra dolla's thanks to the government's Making Food Affordable program and stumbled upon Nothing But Noodles && what I discovered is that they make noodles for the God's and now feature them here on Earth for us mere mortals. I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo @ $6.89 & added 4 oz of Chicken for an additional $2.29. Good eatings GentleMen & GentleWomen. Good eatings indeed. I should mention that I tried to order from the kids menu but was unable to convince anyone that I was twelve standing at 5'12\" & a half weighing 230lbs, ok 250lbs ... you guys are impossible! 285lbs. I eat because I'm unhappy, I'm unhappy because I eat.   \"Fettuccini pasta tossed with our freshly-made cream sauce. Garnished with parsley and freshly grated Parmesan and Romano cheeses.\"  There are a lot of great options on the menu; pasta, salad, soup, desserts and starters. The atmosphere was great, family oriented & kid friendly. Good food. I'll be back! Just as soon as I receive my final modification package for MFA (Making Food Affordable.) I think they serve beer ...   I don't eat noodles a lot, but when I do, I prefer Nothing But Noddles ... stay hungry my friends.

They suggest you look at menu and know what you want when you come up to counter to order. We decided to split the Pad Thai and you get a choice of meat, chicken, or shrimp to add if you want. We chose beef. We also ordered the Cucumber salad. We chose a drink and I picked a little bottle of Pinot Grigio and he chose beer. You pay, take ur number card and sit down. They bring it to your table. Let me tell you, the portions are big enough to split if you want. Pad Thai was delicious!! Perfectly cooked noodles, great spice and flavor, texture and the beef was tender enough to cut with a fork. Cucumber salad was huge and had carrots, red onions, cilantro, tomatoes, slivered almonds, and what looked like romaine, shredded mozzarella, (odd but ok) and iceberg lettuce and slaw. Dressing was Asian and light, needed a little more flavor but so good. I can't wait to go back! Great little place for fast, cheap, and flavorful.",

This was my first time here and everyone was nice and patient with me when taking my order. Will definitely come back to this place again. Looking at what some other folks ordered I can definitely say that you can't go wrong with anything that you get here. They also have a gluten free options for their dishes as well.",

All pasta entrees come with a breadstick. Portions are really good and so is the pricing. Appetizers are great too! I've had the tomato bisque with extra cream and it was delicious.Their salads are great too. There's plenty of options for kids as well. The space is pretty by so it's good for a group plus there is outdoor seating for sunny days. I've visited several times and it's turned into a family favorite. I've been pleased with every dish I have tried ( pasta campanelli, spicy Cajun pasta, pesto pasta, lobster ravioli, and the kids pizza - don't judge me lol. The staff is always friendly there's a points/ rewards system here so for every purchase you get points that ultimately result in 10$ of your meal once you reach a specific number (I'm not sure what it is) lol.",

We had tried the chain's other location in Stonecrest and enjoyed it much more than its competitor, Noodles & Company, so we thought we'd give this closer location a try.  Needless to say, it was definitely satisfying.    I tend to steer more toward the Asian dishes because they're not something I normally make at home.  This time, I tried the Spicy Japanese Noodles.  The sauce was divine.   It had so much flavor and complemented the extremely thick noodles nicely.   And the portion size was \"just enough\" to fill me up without making me too full.   My partner tried the Southwest Chipotle Pasta.  It was very creamy and full of flavor, too.  He said it was missing something, though, so when I gave him the mushrooms from my dish that I didn't want, he discovered that's what it was missing, so it all worked out.    The restaurant also had a great atmosphere.  It was very spacious, modern, and clean.  The service was fantastic, both at the register and at the table when the dishes were served and cleaned off.  This isn't a full-service restaurant, but they do bring your dishes out to you steaming hot (yum!) after you order at the counter.    We're definitely going back...",

I went with the Spicy Japanese Noodles which just had a hint of spice. i did enjoy the thick Udon noodles with mushrooms, broccoli, and carrots. The mushrooms and broccoli seemed a little sparse, they were all just small pieces mixed in. The tofu i added to the dish was done well, but again didn't seem to get a ton. Overall, it's a good place to meet someone working at the hospital for lunch.",

The door was locked because they closed at 8pm. The manager came running to the door and said please come on in and order. I worked in service industry a long time. I would've never made eye contact and walked far away from the door. I know, I'm awful. Heck, we were just turned away next door at Earl's because their kitchen closed at 8pm.   There's a lot of options on this menu. The manager recommended choosing from the Asian or Italian section. He also thoroughly explained the dishes and answered all our questions. We went with the Basil Pesto (add meatballs), Spicy Japanese Noodles, Potstickers, Bruschetta, and the Spicy Cucumber Salad. Everything was good. This may sound weird, but my favorite out of all of it was the salad. I loved the flavors.   Things to know: these are pretty good sized portions for the price. You can easily make two meals out of a bowl. Noodles has a gluten free menu and is also kid-friendly. During my latest visit here, you could get a free drink if you checked in on Yelp. Parking is available on the street and in the lot directly across from the restaurant.  That's pretty neat alert: Nothing But Noodles does a lot of fundraising efforts with local schools and organizations. They've donated over $240,000 in the last eight years.",

I tried to explain that my friends were still eating and I would have happily ordered a meal from them as well if they hadn't been closed.

The Beef Stroganoff is a bit bland, but I like things sauce-y, so I added some creamy marscapone to it when I got home & it really brightened up.  It could use a little more meat in the noodles, but the noodles weren't overcooked, which was good since I had to drive them home.  I just wanted some noodles without fuss, so this fit the bill for this evening.  Relatively easy to get in and out of except for the construction they are doing on Hawthorne, so you have to go around the block to get there... you can cut across Torrence from 4th (I think it's 4th).

It was a little busy, but the line moved fast. The staff was really friendly. I wish I would have checked in before I ordered. They give you a free drink when you check in.   I was pleased there were gluten free options. Some dishes can be made with rice noodles. I ordered the pesto shrimp which comes with spinach. The dish was really tasty. They served the shrimp in a bowl on a plate with the spinach around it. The shrimp at first looked like a bowl of soup. It was creamy and delicious and oh so cheesy. I ate the shrimp part first and then used the rest of the sauce on the spinach.   Even though this was a walk up and order spot, staff frequently stopped by to check on us and clear plates. One even refilled our drinks for us. I highly recommend for a quick bite with excellent customer service.",

I ordered the Lobster Ravioli, a dish which was described as spicy with a cream sauce. The fish was not spicy. It simply has an additional portion of Cajun seasoning. The ravioli was undercooked and the cheese seemed a bit unmelted.   It's rare that I go for this type of fast-foodish kind of fast casual. However, I was in a pinch and thought I might give them just one more chance.   It was enough to convince me not to return.",

They have noodle dishes that expand from Asian to Italian, to American classics. They also have salads and apps, something for everyone in your family, including those with gluten intolerances!   My usual go-to is their pasta primavera. It's loaded with veggies, so I feel a little healthier as I'm carb loading. The sauce that they put on here is delicate and blends with the vegetables nicely. I love the thinness of the angel hair pasta, and honestly, each bite is just really good.   No matter what I get, I always start with an order of their dumplings. I don't know why, but they are just little delicious pillows and a great way to start your meal. The sauce has a few too many scallions for me, so I usually just go straight for the soy sauce, which is still a perfect accompaniment.",

My dish was also not labeled as gluten free, so I have to wonder if it was even gluten free to begin with.   Pretty disappointed in my dish and the shell in my food.

I added as much salt and pepper as i could go my stroganoff to try to make it taste like something but nothing was enough. After 4 or 5 bites I had to just push my plate away.

I thought the price and quality were just right!  I ordered the Pad Thai. Although it had a \"spicy\" icon next to it on the menu, I found it really flavorful but not hot at all (which was great for pre-race). The fella went tamer than me and got the buttery noodles, which were stunningly good given their simplicity.  The noodle dishes are all priced well for the quick service format of the restaurant. We ordered to-go and had two hot noodle dishes in our bag within 10 minutes of ordering. Would definitely consider stopping here again for a noodle craving!",

I had the pomodoro pasta and added chicken to mines.Nothing spactacular or to rave about but i would go back to try out other dishes.I myself was probly more in love with the breadstick than the actual dish. I also had the salted carmel cookie which i am a fan of the cookie maybe next time ill try one of the others they offer.",

Real open layout and you place your order at the counter then they bring it out to you. Their menu really has a ton of choices. It's broken down into different countries or places of origin. There are American, Italian, and Asian sections plus others to choose from too.   The prices are good for the quality and the amount of food you get. We went with the lobster ravioli and the three cheese macaroni plus an appetizer of the potstickers. Our friends ordered several other dishes and they all were superb.   Customer service was awesome and they helped with any questions we had while we were in line. Plenty of room to dine in plus a nice patio to enjoy your meal on Elizabeth Avenue.
