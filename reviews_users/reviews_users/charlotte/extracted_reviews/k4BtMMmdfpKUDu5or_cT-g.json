However, after dinner, our group of 4 decided to hit the bar and have another drink before heading home. There were 3 chairs together so one of us was going to have to stand until the party next to us left, which they said they were about to do. The bartender made it very clear that we all had to sit or one would have to wait outside. WHAT!?! So my husband saw an empty chair a few seats down and went to move it to our group. OH, NO YOU DON'T! The bartender made it clear that was not allowed! Bottom line we were treated like some kind of \"riff-raff\" that he would rather not be there at all. Basically, the bartender had a really crappy attitude and his demeanor was that of a real turd. We will not be going back.",

It was cooked to perfection with a smooth texture and savory sauce. The cocktails were delicious. My husband had the pork chop and I had the steak; both were excellent. The ambience is warm and inviting. Dessert was the strawberry shortcake with strawberry sorbet served with fresh marinated strawberries. The Stanley is a restaurant where the menu changes often and you just have to be comfortable with the unexpected. Chef Paul is innovative and scary talented and he continues to push the boundaries of a myriad of established cuisines. It's sort of Southern cuisine with a French twist but really, the food here defies categorization and that's a good enough reason to keep coming back.",

I'd specifically recommend the steam buns and surf and turf, which are worth the hype.  However, some items seemed overpriced.  I ordered the $17 scallops small plate (among other small plates) to split with a friend; we were surprised when a single scallop was served in a cast iron dish in a chilled watermelon sauce with a few tiny pieces of fruit.  The scallop was cooked well, but not worth $17.  We also ordered a $13 squash blossom, which was similarly very small and not worth the money.  I would suggest asking about the portion size (especially when ordering any small plates) before placing an order.",

We asked if we could substitute one of the vegtables and the answer was \" NO\"!Totally rubbed ys the wrong way!  If you are going to charge $ 28.00 to $55.00per entree and a customer wants to sub a vegtable for another vegtable, I think the customer should be accommodated!

The food looked beautiful on the plate but most of the time lacked the flavor and consistency you expect from a restaurant of this price point. We enjoyed a couple dishes flavor but those came to us cold. The cocktails didn't excite and the couple we did order were overly sweet and lacked creativity. A lot of the wine list can be found at our neighborhood supermarket for about the price of the glass which is safe but unimaginative. The service was at times cold and not as refined as the similar restaurants in town... and I did not notice a manger on the floor during our visit on a busy weekend night.  Overall, our high expectations of Paul Verica's new concept left us wanting more for our money.  I hope there are improvements on our next visit as we will be trying again.",

    "text": "The Stanley has been on my radar since I finally heard that they were opening up. The wife and I had a few hiccups with trying to get in for our reservation as they had some last minute construction that needed finishing up this past weekend. Either way, I was able to secure a last minute-ish time for Saturday night after our Friday one needed to be cancelled. The restaurant is laid out a little strange as there is a front dining room and bar area, and a separate back dining area, with the kitchen kind of being in between the 2. Now I know that some guests have commented on the acoustics in the back dining area and it certainly was loud when we were first seated, but it was definitely due to a 6 top of people who were super above normal decibel levels. There was a definite hush in the room when they left even if the rest of the dining area was still packed. Either way, on future visits, I would opt for the front dining area or the bar itself. I'm not completely sure, but I don't think that the same acoustic issues would be the case there.   The service was attentive and allowed us to take time to make decisions on drink and food all the while explaining us the concept and the menu. The wife decided in a salad to start and the trout with beet risotto for her main. I went full on freestyle and got 3, well 4 in total small plates if you include the pate, which I made my dessert. The wife went more traditional for dessert with the strawberry shortcake. I started with the mushroom soup, which was the only off the menu special I believe. There were a few delivery issues as the thicker soup was difficult to pour out of it's carrying vessel. The server apologized and said that the chef was still working out a few kinks with the presentation. The flavor was there and I really enjoyed it, so no problem in any event. Next up I had the sweetbreads which were served with the inspired flavors of buffalo chicken wings. Blue cheese dressing/sauce, carrot foam and hot sauce. The sweetbreads were pan fried I think with some light batter on them. I was glad that they weren't deep fried as I don't feel like that is the best presentation for them. I really liked the idea, and the flavors were all represented well. Hopefully, there will be a continued presence of the sweetbreads on the menu maybe with other presentations, like an entree version. Next up was the beef tartar, which was a little disappointing, as I have had better versions. Sightly under seasoned on the tartar and really the dish didn't have any wow factor after the sweetbreads. As previously mentioned, I chose the pate for my dessert as I clearly didn't have enough meat at this point in the evening. The country pate was good, but the pork belly rillette ball was over the top good and really closed out the meal for me on a high note. It was deep fried and appears in the middle of the picture. I highly recommend this dish to anyone that loves meat. The wife said that her goat cheese and strawberry salad, and her trout were delicious, as I can attest since I snuck a few bites. The drink menu is varied for cocktails and the wine list was pretty extensive, so there should be plenty of options for all. Some drinks were hit and miss for me, but I really enjoyed the After Dinner which had bourbon, fernet, coffee and a dairy ice cube. As the ice melts, the drink changes and it was delicious. Looking forward to future visits at The Stanley and explore more of the menu as it changes with the seasons.",

The mimosas had fresh squeezed orange juice which the bar tender Damien, organically hand squeezed himself! The broccoli tasted great and was a good portion! The main course the short rib sandwich was very tasty however the presentations was a bit underwhelming. We expected a larger portion after ordering off of the main entree menu. The sandwich could have been made better by having a larger serving size of meat. For desert we got the vanilla doughnut which was beautiful and rich in flavor! Damien was a great bartender/server, as he was personable and gave us privacy to chat with each other. The restaurant itself was super cute and inviting!",

On top of that, the food was just terrible - two of the four of us took one bite of our meal and our server didn't even ask what was wrong. Also, one of the members of our party ordered a coke, which comes in a small 8oz cocktail glass (fountain soda with ice) and they charged for every refill without even mentioning it. So the one coke he ordered cost him $12. Most importantly, The food quality was surprisingly low. The chicken salad sandwich tasted like a salt-lick, actually inedible. I have absolutely no idea how this place is going to make it. They need a major attitude adjustment, above all else. There are too many good places in Charlotte for this one to last.",

The staff was snooty and patronizing. While I understand that reservations take priority to walk ins, there were no tables available whatsoever, even though two parties of 3 and 4 walked out while no one entered the entire time we were there. The table was unstable and rickety. While the food was edible, I almost thought they had confused my entree with an appetizer the portions were so small.  There are so many other better brunch places in Charlotte. Save your money and an opportunity to be disrespected. If I would have known I wouldn't have even bothered. Should have left after the donut when my spider sense started tingling that this was going to be a miserable ride. It was.",

Unfortunately we quickly agreed that the flavor did not match the visuals. The dishes tasted uniformly bland. The review would have been three stars but for the price of soda. We were charged by the glass (quarter can quantity). So two thirds of can of soda cost $9. No pricing for this anywhere on the menu. Confirmed with waiter when bill arrived.

    "text": "I should say my husband and I had a restaurant in the QC for nearly 13 and we have eaten in Michelin Star restaurants all over the world.  So when we are impressed it means something.  We had a wonderful meal.  We so enjoyed Chef Ben's Charcuterie plate very much chicken liver pate with a clarifies buttered top (get outta town good) with real mortadella and pork rillettes (my my my thats dynamite) and it was then on to the tourchon foie gras!  Yummmmm, so delicious with peanut butter and muscadine jelly on brioche was the height of sophistication with southern elements; Well done Chef Paul! The steam buns were banging!  Let's just take the most insanely crispy and juicy fried chicken with ginger and sesame balanced with peppery spicy radishes...good God! Yes, I can build a life with these little babies.  I had the arugula salad that was stage best I've ever had.  I mean could you beat country ham, apples, pecans, blue cheese with wait for it a maple vinaigrette!  I could have had just that and would have been overly content but no...dish after dish it was a feast to savor.  Our 4 year old had the Buttermilk fried chicken entree and when I tell you he licked the plate I'm not lying.  We ordered a side of mashed potatoes of which he proceeded to use his drummet as an implement to scoop them into his little mouth. My cocktail was the 7th & Pecan.  I ordered it because it had all of my favorite elements (barrel rested Cardinal Gin, Italian Zacca and Cardomaro) truly as perfect as it gets for a brown liquor drinker who loves gin.  The crescendo was dessert, which was a crispy log of bread pudding and house made salted caramel ice cream. I mean need I say more.  I do not have a sweet tooth but it had just a hint of salt that made the caramel sweetness all the more enjoyable, it was sooo good!  The service was tops!  Never was there an empty glass or dirty dish left in front of us which is what you always hope for and rarely experience in Charlotte.  It was exceptional as was my overall experience at The Stanley!  Go.  Now!",

Unfortunately the ambience could not make up for lackluster service and bland food. We found the drinks to be tasty though a bit overpriced. The steam bun stood out among the appetizers. The asparagus many ways was beautiful on the plate but lacked flavor. Of the entrees, the pork chop was well received by the group. The risotto featured over cooked shrimp and was a small portion size for the price. The trout lacked flavor. I hope they are able to work out some of these kinks with more time.",

Chef Paul Verica did not disappoint, as the food was inventive and refreshing. The farm fresh vegetables were truly the star of all the dishes we tried and we advise that you eat EVERYTHING on the plate!   We would highly recommend every small plate that we tried, as each one was more delicious with every bite: the Hot Pocket, scallops, tempura broccoli, and strawberry balsamic salad with goat cheese. For entrees, we were pleased with the presentations and portion sizes. Again, the vegetables truly starred in each dish. We tried the strip steak, trout, pork chop, and shrimp risotto. Each protein was well cooked - our only critique is that each entree dish was a bit under seasoned and could have used some salt.  The cocktail list is inventive and original. While price for the size was a little mismatched, we were pleased with the flavor development and creativity of the Mezcal is the New Black (smoky, but sweet) and the Nobleman (tart and refreshing).  Justin provided excellent service and enthusiastically guided us through the menu and helped maximize our experience as a party of 5.  Overall, the experience was delicious and fun, the service was refined yet laid back, and the decor is beautiful. Our only critique is to add a bit more seasoning to the food, which we still loved based on variety and uniqueness. We will be back.",

    "text": "I was really not sure what to expect from my first visit to The Stanley. I had heard a lot of positive buzz from foodie friends and was luckily able to get a Tuesday Evening reservation to celebrate my anniversary. Then I started reading some negative reviews and wondered what experience I would have.  It was a FANTASTIC experience!! And we will be going back for other special occasions. It was one of the top 5 meals I've had in Charlotte. The skill, the diverse menu, the flavor combinations all worked. I think we were using version 242 of the menu, which changes probably a couple times a week based on availability of ingredients.  I was told beforehand I had to have the steamed buns with whatever that version was for the particular menu. This version came with pork belly and asian flavors. We also split an order of the Gnudi with mushrooms and diced country ham. Both were excellently prepared and delicious.  For the main meal, my wife got the shrimp and beet risotto. I had the duck breast with roasted vegetables and parsnip puree. The risotto was perfectly executed. The shrimp were cooked ideally and the flavor blend was amazing. On the duck, our server told us it was sous-vide and then put on the flattop to crisp the skin. The skin also either had excellent seasoning or was sprinkled with finishing salt, but either way the duck, paired with braised greens, roasted beets and carrots seemingly all brought together The Stanley's mission on one plate. It was a perfect blend of fresh, seasonal ingredients. For dessert it was the first time I tried strawberry cobbler. It came with homemade vanilla ice cream. The cobbler was baked in a small cast iron skillet which made the crust crispy and kept the strawberries moist. What impressed my the most about this dish was that the freshness of the strawberries shone. They weren't overly sweet but they were the star of the dish.  What impressed me about the food was the attention to detail and the expertise in how the complementary parts of the dish came out. For instance, the puree under the duck brought the dish together and it was one of the best purees I've had in recent memory.  Regarding the service, we had a server named Chris and he was excellent. A lot of the negative reviews revolved around service, but we were greeted warmly by the hostess, seated promptly and Chris took care of us the rest of the night. He steered me to the duck based on the description of how it was prepared and he had a perfect balance of being there when the water was getting low and yet my wife and I had plenty of space to have a great night talking and taking in the atmosphere. He was also very professional. I was staying off my phone so I missed a text from the bank saying due to suspicious activity, our credit card had been put on hold, so when I tried to use it, Chris professionally said that their system was having problems processing the card. When I pressed him further he said it came up as declined. So I used a different card, pulled the phone out, saw the text and unfroze the other card. Turns out I had been to Teeter three days in a row and charged less than $5 each time and it was throwing up a flag. But the way the server handled the situation was ideal and the mark of a seasoned waiter.  There really was nothing to nitpick or complain about regarding the meal. If the Stanley isn't considered one of the top spots in Charlotte now, I think it certainly will be shortly.",

Upon seeing that there were six open tables as we walked up (and no other parties at the hostess stand or waiting for a table), we decided to try our luck at getting a table since a lot of people cancel their reservations during large storms. This is how our conversation went:  Me:  \"Hi, we unfortunately do not have a reservation tonight, but we wanted to see if it was possible to get a table tonight without one, given the storm.\" Hostess: \"Oh, sorry, we can't accommodate you without a reservation, but we could sit you at the lounge and have a bartender server\"  Me: \"oh, great thank you! Is it poss....\"  While I was mid-sentence, the hostess completely turned her back to me and began to talk to some other person who had just approached the hostess table.  There was literally no one else in the near vicinity other than me, my husband and this guy that approached the table. It was horribly awkward and maybe the rudest I've ever been treated by a restaurant employee. I'm sure the food is great, but there's plenty of other great restaurants in Charlotte that treat their patrons with respect. I'll pass.",

I mentioned we were interested in dessert and he dropped off the menu. 2 minutes later came over and asked if we were ready, which we were not. He then proceeded to look at his watch and say \"tick tock ladies\" it was 9:50, I had no clue they were closing anytime soon as their dining room was still full. I instantly felt uncomfortable and asked for the check shortly after.   Place is stuffy and not the vibe I was expecting.  Disappointing as I live in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "Since my partner and I don't eat out much and had cause to celebrate, I called ahead for a reservation and asked if the menu for the evening would have options for someone who has to follow the AIP. *This is a pretty restrictive diet but ultimately, a farm-to-table spot like this could accommodate because any meats and cooked veggies are a-okay.* The hostess quickly assured me of such when I spoke with her.   Our experience made it feel like the kitchen was phoning  it in...we ordered sunchoke chips + spicy aioli to start but instead of aioli the chips were served with some kind of southwestern buttermilk ranch. So that dish went from AIP-friendly to my partner just eating chips. Then we ordered a charcuterie plate. The main feature of this dish was the nearly 8 oz. serving of chicken liver mousse, followed by a smattering of mortadella, a deep-fried pork belly croquette, and various pickled veggies. This small plate was $18 but that seemed excessive since chicken livers, however well done, are offals. The croquette wasn't AIP-friendly. Then the veggies seemed like refrigerator pickles that had been plopped into a jar of white vinegar for a week and called a success. We decided to go elsewhere for an entree after the experience we had with the apps.   On the flip side, our server was great and the bar program was so creative; the drinks we had were delicious. The bartender sent out a beet + apple mocktail for my partner. We'll definitely return for drinks in the future and forgo the food. A James Beard nominated-chef clearly only gets this kitchen so far; too bad since they're our neighbors.",

    "text": "Summary:  We were served room temperature champagne,  and the kitchen refused to accommodate food allergies after management said it would be no problem both in person and on the phone.  This was the worst experience at an \"upscale\" restaurant that I have had in Charlotte.    We were served warm champagne, poured table-side, before the waitress admitted the wine fridge was broken.   Then I was told if we have food allergies we need to call ahead.... not only did we call in advance,  I spoke with the management in person prior to making the reservation and was assured that there would be multiple items we could order and the kitchen would adjust dishes.  Instead I was told all but 3 items on the menu were off limits,  and anything with dairy in those dishes would be just left off the plate.   Why would I pay full price when you leave off 1/3 of the plating?   Ultimately ordering food was a nightmare. The kitchen refused to adjust dishes, and noted the menu changes daily so we should come back again and see if we have more options!     Given all these issues we had requested a manager stop by our table, which never happened.   This place clearly suffers from their own moderate success and ego.   Do yourself a favor and go to Fig Tree instead.",

My wife ordered the shrimp and grits, which tasted like it had been douced in Tabasco sauce; so much so, that it smothered any other flavor.  My trout was perfectly cooked, but had no flavor except the char from the pan.  I had to use salt and pepper (which we had to grab for ourselves) for any flavor whatsoever.  I did finish it all because I was famished and we didn't have time to eat anywhere else before having to be somewhere.  The bill was out of proportion with the fare and service provided.  We were asked by the manager how everything was when the food arrived.  Had he asked after we started our meal, I would have shared our disappointment.

    "text": "In a nutshell this is a chef owned restaurant with good food, terrible service and too many rules. The chef needs to come out of the kitchen and see how his staff/rules are going to ruin this place. Sad cause the food was yummy.  This place started out bad right from the start. Our table faced Pecan street and every time somebody stopped by Jersey Mikes, their head lights beamed in at us. We mentioned to the server that some blinds would be a good idea and she said nothing worked in that space. It was a basics space and plenty of blinds/shades would work. We had to move our chairs and sit oddly as we were getting headaches.   The drink menu looked good, but there were no vodka drinks. We asked which cocktail would be best suited for us to substitute vodka and were told that would not be possible \"the mixologist will not substitute vodka for anything.\" Somebody in our party wanted a bourbon on the rocks and asked for a Basil Hayden or Woodford. Our server acted like he was ordering gas station quality and finally it took us asking what Bourbon they had. A more appropriate response would have been, if you like those bourbons we have these that are similar. Quite frankly our server was just awful. We caught her rolling here eyes at us and just in a state of constant annoyance.  The food was the highlight of the evening. VERY expensive, but it was good. Skip dessert, it was just OK and not worth it. The coffee was delish though.  Finally after we were done we wanted to sit at the bar. We were told there was no standing allowed (huh??), so we found a little nook with seating that accommodated our party. We were told a server would be with us shortly. After one did not come for a while, we approached the bar only to be told we were not allowed to order from the bar and needed to order from a server. We would have been happy to if one was made available. We left and will not be back.",

    "text": "What an amazing experience!!  We arrived just in time, because it started pouring rain outside.  We were the second table in the entire restaurant, but our reso was at 5:30pm on a Wednesday.  We were quickly swarmed by guests checking in for the reservations and by 6:30pm, there wasn't a seat in the house available.  Amazing!  We started with some yummy cocktails and then transition to a bottle of mixed red wine from Chile (sooo good and full body flavors).  Our waiter was initially overly chatty and we thought we were going to get quickly annoyed by his ramblings, but as the dinner progressed he read the table very well and realized we had our own conversations to perpetuate and left us to it.  Let me tell you about the Caprese Salad Three Ways!  It is unlike anything you will ever taste.  They have somehow managed to make a \"fried pork skin\" texture out of a slice of tomato and oh my I know it will be a menu staple for decades to come.  The arugula salad was also very good with figs!  I almost forgot, most things are tapas style (which I generally despise because I always leave hungry no wanting to \"eat the last piece of shared crumb on the plate.\")  But, I had my fill here.   The chef was very accommodating and realized my vegetarian needs with a plate of mixed vegetables cooked many ways.  It was the best I've ever had!  This chef is going to be highly sought after once the word gets out, and I know The Stanley will win some awards for sure.  Seating is comfortable, air gets kinda cold, bathrooms are very clean, and parking is not the nightmare that the South End sees daily.  I cannot wait to come back and try more cocktails and enjoy more chef creations.",

    "text": "The Stanley is a farm-to-table restaurant, which seems to be a popular description these days. However, unlike most farm-to-table restaurants this one stands out from the pack by having very modernist principles in its food along with a bit of rustic flair. You can tell from the plating and the choices on the menu that there was a lot of thought and love put into the food.  Boyfriend and I booked a table for 7pm on a Thursday night. Normally we try to do a weekend date, but getting a table before 9 on Saturday was a challenge. For a restaurant that has just opened within the past month, it was a good sign. The decor is welcoming and elegant, and there's a back area for seating along with the front & bar area.  The menu changes constantly with whatever they have in season and in stock (my boyfriend wanted the apple pie dessert but they didn't have it this night), so whatever I say here may not be present when you go there. However, considering our experience, you wouldn't go wrong selecting anything of their menu.  The offerings are mostly small plates, with a few entree selections, sides, and then dessert (which is on a separate menu/ask the server about the day's selections). There is a separate menu for wine (they have a huge wine selection) and cocktails (smaller, but still interesting). For drinks, my boyfriend chose the Mezcal is the New Black (which was a delight, bitter with a sweet aftertaste) and the Stanleyville (which is basically a Manhattan with cherry syrup added in). I chose the Caswell Cooler, which was a good gin-based drink that was refreshing.   For the small plates, we chose the foie gras funnel cake (!) and the beets plate. The beets plate had beets made 5 ways: pickled, \"tartared\", pureed, sorbet(ed) and panna cotta(ed). Everything on the plate was meant to be eaten. We both decided that the tatared beets (basically chopped up with a few things mixed in) was the best, although the sorbet and panna cotta were very good as well. The sorbet was slightly sweet, made with yellow beets, while the panna cotta was made with goat cheese and beats and then cubed on the plate. The foie gras funnel cake was a rich experience, with foie gras puree, funnel cake, peaches pureed and diced, and some pecans mixed in. The cake wasn't greasy nor oily, and the peaches and pecans gave the dish another layer of complexity that I enjoyed. Both plates were great for 2 people to share (the foie gras one might even serve 3 people, as it was rich.)  The risotto plate we shared, and for the price, it's quite small, although the shrimp on top were perfectly cooked and the risotto was flavorful. The risotto was creamy with an al-dente bite. However, this was the least favorite of the dishes. If I were to go back I'd probably try another small plate in its place.  For dessert we tried the deconstructed strawberry shortcake. This had to be our favorite dish of the night, as the strawberry jam/macerated strawberries were amazing with the perfectly sweet shortcake. The sorbet had a slight lemony taste to it, and reminded me of strawberry lemonade.   Definitely get reservations if you can -- as we ate people kept filing in for dinner! Also, with anything in the Elizabeth area, parking is a challenge and the lot behind the Stanley is small. We will be back when the seasons change -- I want to see how Paul changes the menu to fit the seasons. :)",

Sitting at the bar was a wonderful choice! The bartender, Damian, was the best. He knew the menu well and crafted delicious cocktails on tope of that he was funny.   I had the Beef Stir Fry and a boulevardier, both of which I enjoyed. My friend had the Shrimp and Grits and The Cortez which she enjoyed. I wasn't able to get what I actually wanted as they had sold out, and I expected that the donuts would be gone before we got there based on other reviews-and they were. That's to be expected when they are as good as reviewed.",

Our server was also very knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations since it was our first time.  Drinks: this was probably our biggest disappointment here because we felt like the cocktails were sub-par. I got a gin cocktail and my husband got a bourbon and we ended up switching to wine and beer after.  Food: the food overall was delicious. We got 5 small plates (oysters, sticky bun, scallop, pork belly and tomato/mozzarella dish) and a dessert, all split between the two of us. I think we were just a little underwhelmed by the food given the price, especially compared to some of the other restaurants in Charlotte where you can have the same dining experience.",

Also, enjoy having personal space and nice ambience, which is plentiful there.    Original: Really enjoyed hanging at the bar, eating a mean cheese plate and drinking well crafted drinks.

We were seated in the back dining area as soon as we arrived.  Our waiter welcomed us and quickly brought out the cocktails ordered.    The menu changes frequently - you can see what version they are on by looking at the top right corner of the menu.    We opted to start with the arugula salad and scallops small plate and then on to our main course with a risotto with shrimp and country ham and a NY strip.  The food was flawless - all so tasty, no complaints.  The atmosphere is intimate and beautiful.  People were dressed from very casual (shorts and polo shirts) to fancy.  The Stanley sets you up to have the perfect evening on your terms.",

The one downfall, the reason for not getting 5 stars and a glaring problem: the staff. So pretentious. Not welcoming and would not choose to go there for just a drink and to chill.   Dinner is lovely though. Me and my handsome date shared several small plates:   Steamed buns: so juicy and tender. I don't really care for pork belly and I ate every last bite. I would've ordered several more had not more food been coming!  Cornbread: perfectly sweet and moist!  Mustard greens and mushrooms: one of my favorite dishes. So much flavor in such a little bowl. Excellent.   Tempura quail: not worth it. No flavor. Weird. On the bone. Next.   Tostada: braised chicken, excellent flavor, didn't have a Mexican flavor profile which was a fun twist. Oh, and the tortillas are homemade. Yummm  Would really like to go back and try brunch! Maybe next trip!",

The cocktail menu is creative and fun. Drinks are made thoughtfully and consistently. The wines are nicely selected and quite reasonably priced.   This farm to table restaurant changes their menu everyday. You'll notice consistencies with twists that change over time. There is creativity and thought not found in many places nearby. Also, you'll probably learn of new flavors and mediums that you've not had before.   My very first experience was full - drinks, apps, dinner with wine, dessert and ports. Our server was great at informing us about the menu, answering our questions, and pacing the meal. We left quite fulfilled and satisfied, even if an expensive meal.   Whether you want to enjoy an excellent cocktail by consistent and friendly bar tenders or want to sit down and have food, you'll leave with a smile.",

We were originally seated in the back room by a window. It was a beautiful day outside with the sun shining in, but the location was very hot, and at 8.5 months pregnant, I was pretty uncomfortable. My husband got up to ask our server if we could move to a location out of the sun, and she was not thrilled about this request, to say the least, and gave him some serious 'tude because we were ultimately moved to another server's section.   This said, our new server who was quite pleasant from the start (unlike the original woman), helpful, and attentive throughout our dining experience.   Our table ordered two donuts to share at the start of our meal (sooo good - highly recommend, and definitely go for the 'flavor of the day'!). I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon for my main course. The pancakes were thin but had decent flavor. My husband ordered the fried chicken biscuit with scrambled eggs, gravy, and grits, which were cheesy and perfect.   I'd like to come back and try dinner here and will hopefully be able to upgrade my 3-star review to something higher.",

The decor was very homey and well decorated! The place seemed less like a restaurant and more like being a guest enjoying dinner at someone's house. The menu had the options of small plates or large plates. We ordered the deviled eggs and the poached egg with grits as our small plates and then shared the pork chop with squash puree. Each plate was very unique and flavorful and we enjoyed trying the different foods! We ended with bread pudding for dessert, which happens to be my favorite desert! Yum! I saw other reviews of this place say that the food was not very flavorful. I am not sure if it was just because they went when the restaurant was still very new or if it just takes a lot of spices and seasonings in order for them to taste their food or what, but I thought the food was very good and flavorful!  The service was also very professional and friendly!  I highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner out and for those who want to have fun trying different and unique combinations of foods. I will definitely be back here!",

The restaurant is nicely decorated and the bar looks immaculate.   Our service was great and very informative which was welcome as we needed help getting a grip on many of the dishes. With his direction we decided to share several small dishes and share one entree. Great decision.   We started with the surf & turf, squash blossoms, and beet small plates. Awesome flavors and beautiful presentation. We were still pretty hungry so we decided on two more small plates: pork belly and bone marrow. The marrow was DAAAAANK.   We split the fried chicken entree which was cooked perfectly and the mole sauce with a succotash type mix was delightful...you can tell they make the mole in house. Super fresh. For dessert we had the bread pudding which was essentially a French toast stick w caramel ice cream.   All of the flavors were delightful. If you like a fine dining experience that focuses on unique dishes and presentation, you will enjoy The Stanley and understand the pricing. Quite frankly, you get what you pay for. Ignore the reviews complaining about price... this place is worth it and probably just not a fit for them",

It was able to accommodate our group even w/slight modifications to the number of women who would be joining.   The service was fantastic from start to finish.  He guided us w/recommendations.   Starting w/the Scallop, the scallop was tasty & perfectly cooked.  The sauce was delicious.  This is def a small plate & not really enough to split w/another person.   The Surf & Turf slaw was fantastic.  W/no hint of acid to the dish, the turf part generally tastes like eating a raw hamburger patty.  Composing the bite together was ok but def needed something acidic possibly in the citrus family to really boost it over the edge to phenomenal.   The tomatoes many ways - sometimes its good to stick to 1 or 2 ways.  The foam was kinda of lost w/no real taste.  A+ for the technicality of the dish!  Whatever was underneath the ice cream for the cobbler, I was scared that I had broken one of my crowns.  I should have let the ice cream soften the garnish a bit more.  After that 1st bite, placed the ice cream on the cobbler - neither were overly sweet & the berries which I wish there allowing the berries to shine thru.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try to the Stanley, went there on our rare night without kids. We sat at the full service bar which was nice to have that option since reservations were hard to get. However the service was very lacking. Not welcoming at all and I felt like I was interrupting by trying to order. When we did get the drinks, they definitely looked pretty but tasted very watered down. When we got to the food orders, another bartender came to help. He was better and I was somewhat relieved. The food was seasonal and I liked that they changed the menu very frequently.   We ordered the chorizo tostada which was awesome, had fresh green onions and jalapenos. Next we had the fried chicken, unfortunately the seasoning was lacking. We were more excited about the veggies because they had more flavor. We ended up ordering the shrimp risotto with beets after seeing it on a customer's plate.  One more dish which was lacking flavor but everything was at least cooked well.   We didn't really get any explanations on any of the dishes which we assumed was because we were sitting at the bar. However as more customers came in and started ordering at the bar, they were getting much more attention with detailed explanations about the ingredients. So the service continued to be disappointing. We had to ask for the dessert menu, very tough to spend my money at this restaurant!    Had to ask for recommendations on the dessert, they seemed a bit snooty when we asked what a creameux was. Ended up getting the described chocolate cake which seemed more like a ganache mousse. All in all, the service was dismal and we felt even worse because it was apparent that we were being singled out. All I know is, we were well dressed but didn't look like your typical WASP customer sitting there. Unfortunately the food wasn't good enough to overcome this. I'm being generous with the 3 stars rating.",

    "text": "In terms of small plate restaurants in Charlotte, in my opinion, the Stanley isn't the best one.  However, service was excellent as were a few of the dishes we got to try. The Stanely is located right on 7th St in the building that used to belong to Crisp. Two doors down is the Crunkleton, btw. There's no designated lot, they are located next to a small shopping center parking but I would not rely on that on a weekend night. We ubered and had no issues.  I made reservations for a Friday evening at 7:30 but, turns out, I didn't have to because it was not busy at all. We were brought to their back section of the restaurant. They have a few tables in front for outdoor dining, a bar area, front section, and area in the back.  Our waiter dutifully explained the concept of the restaurant and menu and took our drink orders. I was in the mood for a margarita but that wasn't a choice on their drink menu so the waiter offered me the 'bartender's choice' where I could describe my ideal flavor profile and then bartender would whip up something based off that. I received a drink that was citrusy and made with tequila. It was delicious!   Our order of small plates soon followed: Mixed green salad Fried chicken steam buns Tempura Scallops   My favorite was the fried chicken steam buns - they came with a savory blackberry jam. I really enjoyed these. I also really liked the scallops, they were served with mini melon balls that provided a nice, fresh bite.   I would make this place more of a stop for a drink and one small plate and then go. I wouldn't make this a food destination.",

We knew there was a small plate aspect going in and I, frankly, thought I would walk away a little hungry but I could not have been more wrong.  The food was fantastic and the service was impeccable.  I left fully satiated.    We started out with a few craft cocktails that a description of delicious would fall too short.  The Basil Station was craft delight that woke up the taste buds.  Next we ordered some small plates.  The Panzenella was awesome with a variety of flavor popping locally sourced tomatoes.  The Squash Blossum Tempura with eggplant, tomato and basil was delightful.  I had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Potato Salad and Waxed Green Beans.  It was delicious and tender.  The Blackberry BBQ sauce was an excellent highlight.  Midway through the meal, I had another craft cocktail, The Rising Sun, and the mixture of smokey Mezcal made me want more, more, more.  For the \"piece de resistance\" I had the Chocolate Mousse Cake with a Carmel Ice Cream scoop, and almond nut brittle topping.  Bravo Chef!  This was an excellent experience and I left with a full and unwanting belly.  Thanks for the above board service by Savanah and MaryJane!  They were great!  We will be back!",

The donuts took awhile to get out due to an issue which they told us about and we were ok with. When they came out they were completely lacking flavor and dense. They were basically a vessel to deliver icing. The absolute worst was the chicken sandwich. Do not order this. It was a single chicken tender on a massive piece of bread. 1/3 of the sandwich had chicken on it. See the pictures below. Such a disappointment. Also we had a vegetarian in the group and they wouldn't do a BLT without the bacon and add an  egg with cheese.",

Four of us split 5 small plates, 2 larger plates (duck and shrimp), an order of cornbread and 2 desserts. The textures and colors on the plates stood out as adding so much to the experience of tasting this delicious food. We let our server guide us through the menu with recommendations and she did an amazing job of keeping us on a great track - trust the experts!   The Foie Gras salad was one of the most unique dishes I've ever had (the strawberry puree was mind-blowing). We also had the surf and turf tower (great portion and delicious), tostada (interesting play on what you'd think of here), and pork belly steam buns (delicious and 2 per order so I'd order however many you need for one per person!)  The duck entree is delicious and the shrimp one sounds simplistic but the beet risotto is unlike anything I'd had before. Overall, this makes for an amazing dinner experience and probably rivals any restaurant across Charlotte!",

    "text": "Toggling between 2-3 stars on this one and am beginning to think that all of the farm to table restaurants in Charlotte are way overhyped. From Heirloom to Haymaker to The Stanley, I've felt all have been subpar at best, with a hefty designer price tag attached. I'm a huge supporter of local owners and when you marry that with my obvious foodie tendencies, farm to table restaurants are kind of a no brainer so.. WHAT IS UP?!  My bf made a reservation at The Stanley a few weeks in advance for a celebratory new job dinner. I was looking forward to Stanley for weeks, and we were both excited to give them a try.   We ordered:  -Surf & Turf: Probably the most unique item on the menu. Their rendition of a surf and turf included beef tartare and fried oysters, which is a unique twist. I'm a huge fan of beef tartare so I liked this dish overall, but the flavors didn't exactly complement.   -Pork Belly Steamed Buns: These were yummy, but honestly you could get this elsewhere for half the price  -Chicken Pot Pie: A decent chicken pot pie overall, but not at all memorable. Portion is also incredibly small  -Foie Gras - Absolutely gorgeous and almost resembled a dessert? Unfortunately, flavors were all wrong and did not complement. Imagine eating a dessert.. with foie gras. We couldn't bare to even finish this dish halfway  -Broccoli and Cauliflower Gratin: Our waiter could not stop raving about this dish and I honestly cannot even remember what it tasted like?  -White Chocolate Bread Pudding, Marshmallow, Sweet Potatoe: DESSERT aka the saving grace! Probably my favorite of the entire experience. Beautifully plated, unique flavors and delicious!   Most dishes resembled art pieces, which I adore, but the foodie in me pleads for substance over beauty.. always. Not a terrible experience, but again, with a $100+ price tag, I'd hope it would at least be memorable. I did enjoy the ambiance and would come back for drinks and dessert. It's possible we ordered all the wrong things or the kitchen had a rough night, but can't say I have any desire to taste the rest of the menu.",

We even got waited on there for a pre dinner cocktail!   Cocktails were good - I tried the Stanleyville (their version of an old fashioned), and the Prince of Thieves.  Hard to pick a favorite here.   Their menu is a changing one because they are a farm to table restaurant and I personally love this. We got the steam buns with pork belly (so, so good, you have to try these!!), cornbread, Brussels sprouts, and the raviolo (this was a bit small to share, but so tasty. The broth alone was delicious).   For the dessert, we went with the carrot cake and the butternut squash creme brulee (it's healthy if they have veggies right!?).  The creme brulee was my fav and not overly sweet!",

    "text": "We had a couple of good recommendations to try the Stanley, so we used our anniversary as a good excuse to check out out.   Reservations are recommended, although if you eat early like we do, you can probably get away without one.   We started with The Cortez cocktail which we both loved. It was refreshing and not too sweet.   We always go with small plates at a restaurant like this. They change the menu almost daily, so you never know what will be on it.   We tried the Surf & Turf, Foie Gras, Steam Buns (pork belly), Braised Chicken Tostada, and Short Rib Ravioli. We loved everything with one exception -- the ravioli. It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't compare to how good everything else was. It was supposed to have goat cheese in it, but we tasted no cheese at all. The chicken tostada was our favorite followed closely by the surf and turf.   For dessert we got the Swiss Roll. I think the menu was misleading on this one. I don't like chocolate, but the menu said white chocolate, cranberry, and pistachio. I assumed it didn't have chocolate because it said white chocolate, but that was not the case (it just had a white chocolate drizzle). My husband loved it though.   It's a farm to table restaurant and you can definitely tell the ingredients are fresh. I wasn't super impressed with the service. It was good enough, but our waiter felt a little cold.   There's a lot of complaints in the reviews that I think are not the fault of the restaurant. Yes, it's fairly pricey. This should be expected at a farm to table small plates restaurant. We felt like the quality of the food lived up to the price.   I think The Stanley is definitely worth checking out. Just make sure to have the right expectations coming in.",

    "text": "This is one of the few reviews I'm super excited to write! Chef Paul Verica has hit a home run in his new restaurant down in Elizabeth. If I was independently wealthy and food had no calories, I would eat here every day.   The restaurant is small, so either go early and sit at the bar or make reservations far in advance. GM Stephen is always there to greet you with a warm smile. The decor is balanced and not over the top. I went one day and sat next two two other very prominent chefs in the city... this is the level of attention this place is getting.   The menu changes frequently due to the fact they use seasonal ingredients. Some of my personal favorites that have been on the menu have been the steak tartare with fried oysters and the smoked trout with beets. I'm also a big fan of their fried chicken steamed bun - an asian inspired dish with all the southern attitude you can handle. My strategy is to order a few small plates as opposed to one large entree, but if you want to go that route, the pork chop was my favorite - sous vide to perfection and then seared, it's not to be missed.   The cocktails are also very inventive and change with the seasons. I would just recommend going at least four times a year to hit every one.   For a special occasion (or any occasion someone wants to take me), this is my favorite place in the Charlotte area for a great meal.   Pro-tip: They do brunch (and home made -very inventive- donuts).",

The atmosphere and decorations were spot on if you are going for a living room vibe . It was relaxing and decorated very well.   The service was very professional , quick and knowledgeable. The restaurant has tapas options so the small plates were great to share with another person or group of people.   We got the devil eggs and a dish with kale, bacon, poached egg and couscous. We ordered the pork chop to split for our meal and it was really juicy, tender and cooked to perfection . I am not a big pork person outside of bacon but I would  definitely go back The Stanley just for the pork chops.    Lastly we had the bread pudding dessert and it was really good! Highly recommend it.",

    "text": "I wanted to like the Stanley so much. I was really excited by the concept and the decor looked unreal! Based on reviews I had read/heard, I really expected to be impressed. Charlotte Agenda blew the restaurant out of the water saying it was amazing.  Overall, it left a lot to be desired  Let's start with the positives: The restaurant is incredibly beautiful and True to the photos. It's a quaint little spot with gorgeous accents.   We went with a group of girls all looking for bites and cocktails. None of the cocktails really grabbed our attention so we moved to wine.  The appetizers were ok. The waitress highly praised a special app called \"The 11 Ways of Corn\". It was not good. One of the ways was a liquid corn feature that tasted like the water from a can of creamed corn. The service was ok. I received the shrimp and grits which were cold and mushy. The flavor was a little bland. Overall, the experience was ok.   A manager never came over and asked how our food was. To be honest, the bill was not aligned with the service and the food we received. To pay $12 for a squash blossom seemed outrageous as a small plate in Charlotte, NC.  The atmosphere is nice, but its not worth the money for an \"ok\" experience with all the restaurants Charlotte has to offer.",

My husband got the Shrimp & Grits & midway through our meal, we switched plates---this dish was amazing.

The only (and I mean ONLY) negative thing I can say for the entire experience is that the hostess was none too friendly... but once seated, our server, Neal, and a host of other servers and staff made our visit beyond delightful!!  We started with the cocktail menu.  I'm a bourbon girl myself, so once Neal told me that the owners were all bourbon lovers who made their own version of the Old Fashioned, I chose it at once!  They call it the Stanleyville, and it was perfection.  I also tried the melon cocktail (rum based) whose name I can't recall... it was very fruity and refreshing, but no substitute for a good bourbon!  My girlfriend and I started with an order of the Scallops, Arugula Salad, and Fried Cheese... If they had turned any of these small plates into larger plates, I think I still would've found the will to lick the bowls!  Not a speck was wasted.  The flavors were clean, fresh, and main ingredient forward.  I never knew how lovely a lima bean succotash could be with scallops, or how yummy figs could be with peppery fresh arugula, or how the simple act of frying cheese could leave us tracing the dish for any smudge of leftover sauce and cheese... a truly amazing experience.  BUT WAIT - then we ordered a dinner to share... They had a beautiful white fish just in from Beaufort that day... I WISH I could remember the name of it, but it was very grouper-like in texture and taste.  Served with greens and wild mushrooms in a brown sauce... we were, once again, drinking the dregs from the bowl...  AND THEN THERE WAS DESSERT... which we TOTALLY weren't going to eat, I swear... and then everyone started saying words which compelled me to say, \"We'll share the bread pudding!\"... They used some wiley Jedi-mind-trickery, folks!  And here's where my review ends... if you want to know how freaking amazing their bread pudding is... go eat at The Stanley!",

    "text": "AH! There is nothing worse than wanting to love a restaurant, but come away disappointed.  Cocktails were good, food was a mixed bag (although the Surf & Turf appetizer was one of the best dishes I've had in the last couple of years), and our service was just poor.  Cocktails: It's obvious that this establishment takes great pride in their mixology. The cocktail list was interesting and fresh, and our drinks were delicious!  Food: Like I said, the appetizer was fantastic. Root veg slaw, beef tartare, and fried oysters were apparently meant to be. Who'd have thought? However, our main courses (trout and duck) were a bit underwhelming. There was nothing BAD, but it didn't feel special, either. Just no WOW moment.  Service: This was a WOW moment for all the wrong reasons. When setting up the reservation on RESY earlier in the week, the restaurant instructed me to list any food allergies or sensitivities along with my reservation, so that the chef would be aware ahead of time. I listed my inability to consume dairy (it's a temporary and VERY annoying food restriction) just as instructed. Our reservation was at 5:30 in the middle of the week (we have a tiny baby at home), so when my husband and I arrived, we were one of only three tables seated in the whole place. Our server introduced herself and then began reviewing what on the menu was dairy-free. Now, that doesn't sound so bad, however, it was. She was barking at us. Like, rudely. As if I was ruining her day with my inability to consume cream. I don't know if she was having a bad day, but there was no smile, there was no small talk, there was no  \"have you been here before?\" or \"here are my favorites\". And it never got better. She never checked to see if our meals were to our liking and we had to flag her down for a second round of cocktails. I was killing her with kindness and the only time she even cracked a partial-smile was when she was returning our bill after running the card...too little too late.  I might have given 4 stars if this review was on food and drinks alone, but I would have given 1 star if this review was only on service. With a bill that was around $175 for 2 folks I feel like it's okay to expect friendly wait staff. I've had friends who have dined at the Stanley and had wonderful service, so I have to guess my experience was just a one-off (I HOPE). I will try them again and cross my fingers I get someone who actually likes their job.",

    "text": "The Stanley has been well reviewed hereunder. My experience is that it is a solid addition to the Charlotte fine dining scene. The front room seats 24, or so. It is, as mentioned, cosy. It is not crowded, though. There is sufficient room between tables. Servers do not struggle to place food. The decor is warm and familiar. The lighting is sufficient for conversation and menu reading, which is bit of a surprise since so many other prefer flashlight levels of lighting. Silverware is quality and heavy, German made chinaware. Ingenious and attractive seasonal table floral vases. The wine list is an education with items uncommon in Charlotte such as French cremant. There were eight places empty when we entered, plus several at the bar, and just two when we left plus several more added to the bar. Even with this, conversation at the table was of no trouble.  Our server was attentive and receptive to delays when necessary for ordering. Two small plates and two main courses ordered. The arugula, country ham, blue cheese, balsamic was well mixed and the ham a nice and unexpected addition. The blue cheese made no appearance. Duck breast was flavorful. It could have been more trimmed yet the duck fat is what gives the flavor. It comes sliced so trimming is easy on the plate after the first bite. Bed of farro, turnip, carrot and parsnip all in clear participation. The pork tenderloin may have been the high point. Lovely presentation. The price for the table is no more than what a similar table elsewhere in the city main dining establishments would carry. I will return.  This visit was on a Wednesday night. Parking can be tricky. Reservation was made and restaurant sent SMS follow to confirm.",

Don't be put off by the color of the Mezcal, the Smokey flavor was really enjoyable. We shared several dishes including: the Tempura which was light and crisp, the Foie gras funnel cake had amazing fresh peach slivers, peach dust and dehydrated peaches, the porky belly steamed buns were my favorite of the small plates I tried, and the risotto and shrimp was creamy and delicious. Unable to pass on dessert, we tried the unbelievable strawberry shortcake.This too had strawberry dust, fresh and dehydrated strawberries with a very flavorful sorbet and was absolutely delicious! We also had the apple pie with a sweet rich caramel ice cream with crunchies. Loved this dessert too! Every dish was as beautiful as it was delicious. Even the music selection added to the fabulous ambiance in The Stanley. I highly recommend it and can't wait to return.",
