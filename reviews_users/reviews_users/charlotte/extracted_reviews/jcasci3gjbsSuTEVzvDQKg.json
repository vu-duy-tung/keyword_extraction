Lots of well dressed people inside, so it must be a decent place right?  Wait staff was good and attentive, and quick.  Everything was just OK. Bread and olive oil/vinagerette dip were OK, Goat cheese and bread appetizer, just ok.  I had the veal milanese, with arugula and onions, and a  side of asparagus (4 dollars for like 7 little baby 'gus's). Only ok.   They had a special on beers \"All Italian beers on sale\" -what italian beers do you have? Peroni. Thats it. Hardly a special.  Not bad, but wouldnt visit again. All the dishes were typical with no risks, and no reward.",

    "text": "Made a reservation for 7:30 via OT, which is something I've become addicted to lately. Upon our arrival we were given a coaster/beeper and went to the bar. Our table was ready in less than 10 minutes.  We were sat at the table just outside the kitchen, which is a pretty ideal place to be. Not only could I read the specials (and prices) on the whiteboard in the kitchen, but our server was always around in case we needed to flag her down.  The mascarpone goat cheese appetizer was... \"meh\". I encouraged my husband to order it after reading all the rave reviews here. Here's the thing, I hate the \"mustiness\" of goat cheese. I figured that perhaps the mascarpone cut that flavor, and that everyone was raving over it because it tasted better than I remembered goat cheese tasting. It really didn't. I wasn't thrilled.  My husband got the penne with tomato vodka sauce and some turkey meatballs. I got \"Joe's\" pizza. Both were very good, and even better the next day as leftovers. Frankly, I was sincerely hoping for a butternut squash pasta special but sadly, that was not to be. Probably only comes up in the fall...  We'll be back. This place is every carb-loader's dream. (Heard the table behind me ordering pasta in preparation for the next day's Corporate Cup half marathon, and we went there for my husband to carb load before his long ride... So if you need carbs, go here!)",

    "text": "I've been going here since 2000 but never have fallen in love with it like everyone else. Maybe I'm weird. Maybe I've got a very sensitive palette. Maybe I'm just not average, but I find Mama Ricotta's well below average and very very very salty.  I'm not someone who shies away from salt- I always have it on my eggs, etc.  But it seems like recently, everything at Mama's is over seasoned.  A lot of the dishes like the Pasta Primavera is very unremarkable so generally I like the chicken carciofi the best, but perhaps because of the capers it is so salty I can never finish it. I went there for a business lunch (basically the only reason I'll go) and had a roasted beet salad. I thought I was in the clear with a salad, but no- it was so salty too! A salad?? And not a nicoise salad?? It was very strange and it was very overdressed. Perhaps next time I'm forced to go, maybe I should try a sandwich?   The other complaint i have about this place is the service. One time recently the server was really inattentive. The second time, the server was really bitchy (and it was a guy). I've never understood how someone who relies on tips is smug and rude. Anyway that paired with the mediocre food means I'm never going to intentionally go here. I'd opt for Fiamma, Luciano's or Hawthorne's Pizza before here any day.",

They drizzle the sauce around the plate so you get a hearty mix of the cheese and sauce mixture for your bread - YUM.  I have liked every pasta dish I have ordered here - and the pizza is made in their wood-fired oven.    Recently I got the pasta with vodka sauce - it is so much food!  Very delicious but heavy, you can easily split this with your dinner partner.  The outdoor patio is so breezy and cozy you will love to linger over your wine.

I think we ordered every appetizer on the menu.  Calamari - It was ok, I am not much of a fan it did seem a bit on the rubbery side.   Bruschetta - Was very soggy with the tomatoes, not sure if that was the point but soggy bread is not very appetizing.   Tomatoes with mozzarella - The tomatoes were great but the mozzarella slices were SO thick it was ridiculous, nearly double the size of the tomatoes.   Goat Cheese - This was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night. Very rich and smooth.   I ended up ordering the special of the evening: Chicken and spinach ravioli with white truffle oil. It was good but nothing to rave about.   I have had way better Italian in Charlotte so its hard for me to recommend Ricotta's.  Oh and I dont know if it was me but the floor seemed super slippery!",

    "text": "Here's what I sometimes don't like about visiting a restaurant I've been to before for Charlotte Restaurant Week: the food is okay, but I usually end up wishing I'd ordered off of the regular menu. Then my bill would have been about the same or less, I would have gotten what I wanted, and I wouldn't have had to fight for a reservation at the most popular spots. Had I done that at  Mama Ricotta's, I would have ordered the Warm Goat Cheese and Marscapone Dip and Butternut Squash Ravioli or the Cannolicchi Pesto Di Pomodoro Secco.  My taste buds would have been doing the happy dance, because those are my \"go to\" dishes at Mama's, and they never disappoint.  Instead, I had the Mozzarella and Tomatoes Salad, which was good and should have been, because that is a tough dish to turn into a hot mess. I also had Mama's Pesto Pasta, which was on the bland side at the restaurant, but the leftovers were much better the next day after overnight marination. My main course was Veal Milanese Primavera, which was just okay. Judge me if you want, but if veal is on a restaurant menu, I'll generally order it. Like lamb or venison, it is something I'm most likely not going to prepare at home, only because I wouldn't know what to do with it. However, I've sampled quite a bit of veal in restaurants, and this veal was nothing special.  One of my dinner companions actually did order off of the regular menu, and chose the Canneloni Al Forno. It pains me to say this, because I generally like Mama's, but it was not good. I didn't even know this was possible, but it was fairly flavorless except for the aftertaste, which to me was sour. My companion disagreed on the aftertaste, but felt that it was below average in general because it lacked flavor.  Other companions had the Penne Alla Vodka and the Pollo Carciofi, which they enjoyed.  The Nutella Pie, though, was more than large enough to share, and was creamy and full of hazelnut and chocolate delectableness, and frankly was what drew me to restaurant week at Mama Ricotta's. As always, the bread was warm, garlicky carbohydrate joy. Service was amiable, if a bit slow on entree delivery and water refills. The half-price wine on Monday nights was also a plus.   Four stars are being given to Mama Ricotta's for their usual fare. For Charlotte Restaurant Week's offerings, I wouldn't be that generous.",

    "text": "Recently moved down here from Long Island, New York.  I had a great local pizza place near my house that made some tasty dishes as well as pies.  Oh, boy do I miss that establishment... and New York Deli's, I wish they existed down here. Why can't I find a damn deli that puts bacon, egg, and cheese on a damn \"kaiser like\" roll? Is it the kaiser part? It's not a freaking nazi roll... Jiminy.  Anyway, I digress.  I was looking around on yelp to find a highly rated Italian place that also served family sized dishes so I could pick up takeout for me, the wife, and kids.   My children are too young to trust that they will not bother other patrons with their \"annoyingness\"...  This place seemed great! We ordered the PENNE, BROCCOLI & CHICKEN and the GOAT CHEESE & MASCARPONE DIP.  Zero complaints about the dip other than most of the bread we were given was burnt. Gave those to the kids and dog... Doubt they'd notice.  The pasta dish was one of, if not, THE worst pasta entrees I have ever ordered.  I can not recall a single time that I have ordered pasta and it was a mushy over cooked travesty like this was...  Flavor was decent, lemon=yum, but the pasta tasted like it was cooking for the entire 35 minutes that we were told it would take to complete the order. I don't care about words like \"Al Dente\" as long as the pasta does not taste like it has been cooking for days!!  I literally had to \"cook\" and add salt, pepper, and melted mozzarella under my broiler so we could eat it and I still ended up throwing some out.  For over $45, I expected more. The kids ate some of it so I guess that is something...  If you don't care or have never had properly cooked pasta, then, it is edible.  If you wanted something awesome worth your repeated business then, for me at least, I'd need some proof they could cook pasta right.  I likely will not give them another chance cause the pasta was really that bad.  This is the first review I have ever done cause I have never ordered from an Italian place that couldn't cook pasta properly. I hope this was just a one off but for the cost of admission... I cannot really afford to find out.  So disappointing :(",

After seeing the pictures of giant plates of chicken parmesan smothered in cheese we decided on Mama Ricottas.   I was shocked at how busy they were on a Sunday night! We were seated immediately but after sitting down we saw people waiting. The atmosphere was great. A dimly lit Italian restaurant just as we were hoping for. Service could have been better, but I think our server was just over it by Sunday night. He probably worked a double or two over the weekend-- I get it.   We ordered a bottle of wine and started in on the bread and olive oil. The calamari sold me because of the cherry peppers. However, I didn't realize we needed to order it Rhode Island style for it to come out this way. In my excitement I didn't read close enough. Was disappointed when it didn't come out with the peppers, but now I know for next time. My server offered to have it tossed, but since it was our mistake, I declined.   The chicken parm was just as big and beautiful as it was in the picture. Took over half of it home. I would prefer a little more sauce (the marinara was great), so next time I would just ask for it. Boyfriend got the lasagna, which he loved. For $12 it was a great deal.   Overall, I felt like the food quality and atmosphere was a great value for the price. Great place for a date night-- we will definitely be back!",

As for the entrees, we ordered the Sauteed Beef Tenderloin & Creamy Wild Mushroom Risotto & Linguine with Clams.  The entrees were okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. The Risotto was cooked with so much butter. Have had better Italian food than this. The is Americanized Italian Food.  Our waiter, Eric who was new was very attentive. Every time we looked around he came over to see if everything was okay. The manager came over to double check if everything was okay for we had an issue with one of the wines.  The meals came out so fast. While were eating the appetizer, the salads came out. I was still eating my meal when they placed the check on the table. Felt like we were in a diner back in NYC.",

That being said we got 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers, a small Tuscan salad, penne alla vodka with chicken, polka alla griglia, and the chocolate cake-- and spent about 60ish dollars. We loved every single bite. Service was extremely nice and we got our food quickly. They also had delicious garlic rolls they give you in the beginning. Loved the experience.",

    "text": "Absolutely scrumptious! One of my co-worker recommended this place to me several months ago.. and I finally got around to dining here! I love the atmosphere- family photos adorn the walls, fine, white clothes and tableware set the tables. The wine barrel semi-wall is really neat. The restaurant is segregated into various areas, such as the pizza bar with someone stretching and throwing dough in front of you, high tables, low tables and a wine cellar area.   Now to the food-  I started with the fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil- fresh and delicious.  Pasta Primavera with cream sauce- angel hair pasta with fresh veggies cooked to perfection and tenderness with nicely seasoned creamy sauce. Oh my goodness, I will be returning! So worth it.  I believe my friend ordered the Penne Alla Vodka, which wasn't anything spectacular. We tried each other's entrees and she loved mine.   Next time I visit, i'll try and save room for dessert.   Staff was welcoming and friendly.",

It arrived super burnt and i was like  because I couldn't believe they would actually send a crispy blackened top layer lasagna out to a customer for consumption . The waitress was super nice and apologized when i said something to her and took the meal away to replace it.  I guess the cook was mad at me because they replaced it with a cut that was about half the size of my original order . The sauce was watery and downright disappointing to be from an Italian restaurant. I took one bite and was extremely disappointed in the taste.  I bagged it up and took home and shockingly my two kids said it was the worst lasagna they ever tasted as well.  This is from a 15 yo and 10 yo. I should have or something else smh.",

Calamari. 5/5 due to crispy edges and chewy squid! I was never a fan if an Italian place would overcook the squid. oh, and the marinara? YUM.  I had the ravioli and my boyfriend had the carbonara. Both super delicious, although a popular favorite is the penne a la vodka! All their sauces are creamy and well-seasoned.  Tiramisu. Holy crap this was by far the best tiramisu I've ever had, and I believe for that to solely be based upon the fluffyness of the cake, and lightness of the (whipped?) cream filling.   the ONLY reason I didn't give this place a full 5 stars is due to the long waiting periods during our service. We were seated in the outdoor area (included a working fireplace in an insulated tent) and there were 2 waiters assigned. some times they came to our table at the same time or nonstop. then there were periods when we needed something, and they weren't anywhere to be found. very strange.",

I asked a few questions about the menu and the servers response were incorrect or asking me a question back. When you are paying $20+ per dish you want to make sure you will enjoy your food or at least I want to know. I asked what polenta was because obviously I've never heard of it and servers response was \"you never heard of polenta\" and than goes on to tell me it potatoes that had a sauce on them. Well hate to break it to you but I goggled it as soon as she walked away and come to find out \"she didn't know what is was either\".  I find it kind of rude to ask the same question to a customer that they asked you than make up what the food is and not go ask what it was. Few other questions we asked about the menu such as do you have a house salad? Response was you can just pick any of them. Well come to find out the one we picked dressing couldn't be changed than goes to tell us which one is the house salad that we could actually pick our dressing for. I could go on and on of smart remarks and incorrect information that was given during this dinner but I will stop here. With this said hopefully they see this review and get their servers on board with knowing their menu.",

    "text": "Went to Mama Ricotta's last night with my family (there were 6 of us) for my daughter's birthday.  First turnoff was when we received our bruschetta appetizer - the bread was literally black!  Black - I'm talking completely burned to a crisp! - I cannot imagine what went through the server's mind that this was ok bring to us!???  Trying to cover it up with the bruschetta was not ok.  They did have the decency to remove the $9.50 charge from our bill.        Second - on the menu they have chicken parmesan listed - Single serving -$18.00 and Family Style - $33.00.   We ordered one of each kind - 1 single and 1 family.  When placing the order for the family size chicken parmesan, the waiter asked if we wanted the pasta with it - we said yes.   That was all he said - \"do you want to the pasta with it?\"  We thought it was an odd question because when have you ever ordered chicken parmesan in any restaurant and not had it come with a side of pasta???   NEVER, absolutely NEVER.   When they brought the food to the table, my son, who ordered the single size chicken parm, received  2 pieces of chicken and pasta on the plate.   The family size order came with 5 pieces of chicken on a plate and a \"soup size\" bowl side of pasta.    When the waiter brought us the check, we had been charged $47.00 for the family size chicken parm, not $33.00 as the menu listed.    When I asked him about it, he said \"that was for the pasta you said you wanted\".  I calmly said \"you did not say it was EXTRA for a small bowl of \"side\" pasta or that it would cost FOURTEEN DOLLARS!\"   His only comment was \"I can get the manager for you - I don't know - I can get the manager for you\"   he just kept repeating that over and over again. It was weird.   All I wanted was clarification, because when I looked at the menu again - there was another column listed by the single and family that said \"+2sides\".  So I asked him again - what is the column that says 2 sides for?  If that is where you got the extra charge from , why did we only get ONE side of pasta?   Again, he flipped out and just repeated \"I can get the manager\"   What was his problem? Does he not understand the menu?  Not wanting to continue this scene the waiter was making, we just paid the bill and left.   I did not want my daughter's birthday dinner ruined by this idiot that can't explain the menu or doesn't understand it.    I CANNOT believe they charged us FOURTEEN dollars for a small soup bowl of pasta not to mention - why are they charging AT ALL for pasta to go with chicken parm?    There was NO charge for the pasta that came with my son's single serving of chick parm?   WHY does pasta come with that size and not the other????  WHY???      I will NEVER go back to this restaurant again - it is a total rip off.",

We had a reservation (which I'd recommend for a Friday), and we waited no time at all despite the crowd.   The bread was great, our tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil appetizer was wonderful, and our two entrees (we had a mama's salad with grilled chicken and the pasta dinner special) were delicious!  We ended the meal with the apple crisp which was warm and served with a cinnamon gelato.  Everything was delicious.  Our server, as I mentioned before, made the evening great as well!  He was very attentive to our needs and engaged in conversation without being too talkative.  Definitely going back!!",

This might be my favorite lasagna I had at a restaurant - the sauce, cheeses and everything was perfect.  They have a really good menu - lots of options and lots of price ranges which is nice, too.  The service was excellent and there is a lot of seating which is good since they probably get super busy on weekends.",

We got hungry, so we decided to go early - assuming it wouldn't be THAT busy on a Thursday night.  We were pretty wrong.  We were told that it would be 30 minutes (basically the same time we had reserved).  No big deal - to the bar to grab a drink.  Four minutes later, we were told that our table was ready.  Great - except, I need to close out at the bar...and if we would have known we would be seated so quickly, I would have waited and just ordered a bottle of wine.  Oh well, to the table with my beer in hand.  Sat down - got waters and bread/olive oil (which was great).  I ordered a small Caesar salad and the chicken parm.  The other three split a full salad (it was huge...if there's three of you, you don't need the family size salad) and had their entrees or pastas.  Pastas can be single serve if you're hungry.  I was able to finish half of the chicken parm (basically one piece of chicken and half of the pasta).  We all ended up taking three boxes home after passing on the desserts.    A couple qualms.  Even on a Thursday night, the place was crowded (not so bad) - but it was loud...very loud.  We would have probably stayed and had dessert or another drink, but we could barely hear each other anyway - so we did not.  The restaurant is very dark.  Maybe people (other tables) were using their phones to read the menu.  Many it is part of the ambiance - but, other restaurants have \"light up\" menus.    Was the food good? - Yes, it was great. Service good? - Yes. Good value? - Yes, chicken parm entree was $20 something, but gave me two good size meals. Other issues? - Yes, loud and dark. Would I go back? - For sure, with the right set of people.  It's much more of a friends place to go.  I wouldn't do a first date or meal with the rents.  P.S. - I ate the leftover chicken parm for lunch today - it was still great!",

We were seated in a booth on the far side of the restaurant against the windows, and were slightly concerned that we'd be a little cold given the wintry temp outside. The heat was on full-blast, though, and we were SO happy about it - seriously, when are you ever actually warm in a restaurant?!  I highly recommend splitting the Chopped Salad -- the small ($7) is great to share with two people if you're looking for a little green before carb-ing out. Hubby got his usual lasagna and considering his plate was clean in 5 minutes, I'm betting it was awesome (didn't get to sneak a bite). I chose the Pollo Carciofi and it was seriously incredible -- my new favorite go-to meal for sure. Even better, I only ate half and have a super yummy lunch to look forward to this week.   Thanks for yet another great experience, MR!",

I have heard so many of my friends rave about this place, and it's been on my list for some time now. When my dear friend Jessie invited the boodle and I to join them for NYE dinner at MR's, I just couldn't say no. Mama Ricotta's and good company... sign me up!  We had a 6:30pm reservation and the boodle and I arrived about 15 minutes early. I wasn't sure what to expect with the place being in a strip mall. It was warm, inviting, and beautifully decorated inside. Exceeded my expectations for sure.   We were seated promptly at 6:30pm and our server was incredibly friendly. MR's was offering a NYE menu as an option, but it was not required. Jessie and I did order the NYE cocktail special which was a black cherry champagne beverage; it was delicious. The fresh bread that came to our table was a garlic-y, buttery bread. It was so good!   I am rather plan when it comes to meal time. I stuck with the classic Angel Hair Pasta was homemade tomato basil sauce. It was so good! Boodle ordered the short rib over gnocchi and it was amazing. I had a few bites and wished I had ordered it.   There is plenty of parking at Mama Riccotta's and everyone there was really friendly.",

I asked her where the cheese was?  She said it doesn't come with any, and she came back out with a tiny condiment cup full. That was a nice gesture, I suppose.   My friend absolutely loves tomatoes, and I could tell she was completely put off by this dish from the look on her face from the first bite.  We both only ate one to be polite.",

I had the Tuscan salad and lasagna and enjoyed the flavor of both. My husband had the angel hair pasta with meatballs and a side of grilled zucchini and red peppers. He enjoyed them both. Our favorite part of the meal was dessert - we had the strawberry gelato. The  ambiance is nice and we had good service. There were only  2 negatives, first was the cramped front waiting area. There was only one bench with lots of people standing and waiting inside since it was raining. Second, we had reservations which I highly recommend since the place is busy especially on a Friday night. We had reservations for 8 and were seated by 8:15. The restaurant seemed to start clearing about the time we were seated so I'd recommend an 8:30 or later reservation on Friday evenings. Parking was available but did have to walk a little. Also know that the noise level is higher because it's so busy. We didn't mind the noise level because we had a toddler with us. Despite the crowded front and delay in reserved seating, I still give 5 stars because the food was amazing. We'll be back!",

    "text": "This is a great Italian restaurant! I've been here a couple times now and have always had wonderful food.  Note the portion sizes are pretty large so come hungry or with a friend or group! (They do come in individual portions or family size). It's great if you're looking to try a bunch of different things.  The two times I've gone, I've seen birthday parties, girls night out, date night and big family gatherings.   As with almost all Italian restaurants, they serve dinner rolls. These are delicious plain but even better dipped in their oil. If you're sensitive to spice, be wary as the oil has some heat to it.  Their salads are also generous in portions. I went with my boyfriend and we split a small Tuscan salad prior to our entree. We ordered the family size ravioli with meat sauce which is enough to feed 2-3 people. The cheese filling is delicious!!   I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes like lasagna and pollo Romano.  Ps: if you're an Open Table user, they are on there!",

We did ask for additional Balsamic Vinegar. The addition made them from delicious to outstanding! The house made Mozzarella was so creamy and smooth. As a group of 4 we decided to do the family portion Chicken Parmesan with angel hair pasta. There was very little tomato basil sauce, but we asked for additional and they gladly brought it. The flavor of the Chicken Parmesan was on point. The side of angel hair pasta was enormous and way more than 4 adults needed.  If anyone left hungry it was their own fault. Portions generous and very tasty. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we had drinks full and cleared dishes to keep things tidy.  We will definitely be back again!",

After looking at menus and reviews, I decided to bring the hubby to Mama Ricotta's on a Saturday night. It was busy, but the service did not suffer. Our server was attentive and multiple individuals stopped by to check in, clear plates and refill water throughout our meal.    To start we ordered the Arancini and Chopped salad, both solid choices. Second course the Penne Alla Vodka and Cheese Ravioli - delish and cooked oh so well! For our main course we shared Chicken Parmesan and Steak Peperonata. The steak was cooked nicely but the chicken was underwhelming. We had a feeling it was due to volume and trying to get meals out fast. It just lacked flavor and there was barely any sauce. We ended on a high note with chocolate cake and strawberry Panna Cotta.   Overall, great experience and good food. We will definitely be back and I want to give the chicken parm another try - considering it's one of our classic faves!",

Appetizers were great, we had a samples platter with all the Italian staples. I had the veal Marsala which was a little sub par from what ice had in the past however I tried others' meals which were all great.  We had tiramisu and the Nutella cheese cake both of which were great but enough for all to share.   All in all good restaurant and great for groups.",

I found it on yelp and looked like they had some delicious menu items and were also close to where I was staying. I always try new places that are not chains and this one had lots of items I was interested in.   I looked at the menu and ended up ordering the goat cheese and mascropone appetizer that you also got with crostini and marinera sauce, The salmon salad, and also the apple crisp dessert. When I called to order the person who took my order was very helpful and knew a lot about the menu items which almost never happens. Since I also ordered take out she made sure to tell me that everything would be packaged seperately so it would not get soggy.   When I picked up my food it was so nicely packed and delicious as well! I loved all of the food and would defnitely love to go back there again. Definitely a nice place to just go and have a quiet dinner with some friends. The wine and beer selection was pretty great as well!",

We walked in to a slightly dimmed restaurant with authentic photos decorating the tan walls, beautifully designed red curtains pushed aside and comfortable seating full of chatty families. I loved it. Once we sat down, our waitress, a petite blond lady (whose name I forgot after my delicious sangria) quickly greeted us, got us water, and some of the best bread Ros I've had this year. Good. Ness. I ordered the angel hair pasta with turkey and ricotta meatballs, and my boyfriend got some flat pasta and chicken. The drinks came quickly, and the pasta came quick too. The servicing sizes were generous; my plate was about $13 and I would've easily paid more for it, and was grateful I didn't have to. On top of that, the food was AMAZING. Fresh, authentic and delicious. I might be back next week.",

Our food arrives, I ordered the cheese ravioli but added shrimp to it for an additional $6.  When it comes I begin to eat my first shrimp and see it doesn't look cooked.  I really inspected it, like always the lighting is low for \"the mood\" so it was hard to see.  I look through my other shrimps and they all still look very gray.  I ask others at the table and they agree.  When the waitress comes by to check on us I genuinely asked for her opinion as well and she too says it doesn't look cooked - it's raw shrimp! She takes it to be re-cooked and it comes back all well and good but now I'm not really feeling the shrimp so I avoid it.  The manager comes by and asks \"is the shrimp to your liking now?\" To my liking? I don't feel like this is like beef where I confused rare, medium, and well.  Shrimp is either cooked or it's not.    My bill comes, and though I didn't ask for it I somewhat expected them to comp the $6 shrimp charge.  Nope.  It was still one there.  I looked up the possibilities of what could happen from eating raw shrimp and it stated that it would most likely cause food poisoning if anything.  Call me crazy though, but I would hope places I go to eat would help me avoid getting food poisoning from their food.  I felt like I got no apologies, no customer service for a fairly big screw up, and I could have gotten really sick from their mistake on a holiday weekend no less!  I don't think I'll choose to go back here again from this experience.  I might if a member of my party requests it (because other than that it wasn't terrible), but I will NOT order a meat dish from them again.",

The dining room is cozy with large family-sized booths plus intimate tables for two, vintage family photos, and a large wood-fired pizza oven.  My recommendations:  goat cheese and mascarpone dip, mama's salad, chopped salad, housemade burrata, any of the pastas, pollo bianco, bread pudding.. and so much more..

The shrimp and crab risotto was delicious, creamy & buttery, a True risotto. We also ordered the Pollo Alla Griglia, a seasoned grilled chicken, served with mashed potatoes & the vegetable of the day, which I substituted for the grilled asparagus, delish! The service was great and the wine selection perfect! An enjoyable evening in the patio, and somewhere we will return!",

I'm not kidding, they took care of us, the waiter was friendly and they even changed out my salmon when it wasn't up to their standards,again amazing. BUT this third time was not a shining star like I'd hoped it would be.   I brought my cousins from out of town they love Italian food! I had such nice service the two previous times I just knew they'd love it here because of the good food and the good service.   Our server was very neglectful. It took her a very long time to come take our drink order. Which we weren't ready for because they didn't give us a cocktail list. So we order appetizers, calamari and the bruschetta, and she got the cocktail menus, brought them to us, and left again. Our appetizers came and her second return took much too long again. So we ordered drinks and She carded me, my boyfriend and my cousin which is fine,I'm 26, he's 23, and he's 22, so we're all used to that and I don't fault her for it. She took our drink orders, and food orders and walked away without taking our menus from us or saying another thing. Now it was four of us sitting at our small table with two appetizers, a bread bowl and bread plates and all the extras you can think of on the table. There was no where for us to put anything let alone menus we no longer needed. My boyfriend asked the hostess who was walking by to take the menus and mentioned that our waitress wasn't really caring for us.   Next thing I know the manager came over and apologized for the lack of caring and for her not taking the menus which seemed super nice. It reminded me of the other times we were here when they took such good care of us.  But that wasn't really why he was at our table that was just glanced over. He really just wanted to see our IDs too. I'm a reasonable person and I understand needing to be carded but by TWO different people at a very nice sit down restaurant just seems over kill to me. Especially when my already non caring waitress walked away acting like she's going to put our orders in. At least warning us that you just want you manager to check our IDs would have made it feel less degrading. Honestly this whole thing made me feel pretty down on this place. It's really disappointing and severely changes my opinion of this place which sucks because we really loved it before this.   The food was good and thats the only reason it's four stars and not three, but I just don't need to pay that amount of money to feel degraded and unhappy after I have a meal somewhere.",

    "text": "Everything about our experience this evening at Mama Ricotta's was good but not outstanding.  We came in fairly early and were seated immediately, which was nice. They provide free bread and oil, but the bread didn't seem very fresh at all so we didn't touch that other than a few bites. For an appetizer, we started with the goat cheese and mascarpone dip. The tomato sauce was great, and the tangy cheese provided a good balance of flavors. For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered the pollo bianco and I got the lasagna. The pollo bianco was really good - the mushroom gravy went well with the mashed potatoes and chicken, and the broccoli and cauliflower were amazing except for 2 broccoli florets that were severely burnt! The lasagna I had was good, but it was a bit too cheesy for me. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese..but it really just tasted like layers of lasagna noodles with a bit of ricotta between them and a ton of mozzarella melted on top with a bit of tomato and meat sauce on the side. I would have loved for a bit more flavor throughout.  Our waiter was a bit awkward as well. He did a good job keeping glasses full, taking orders, etc. but just seemed like he wasn't sure how to interact with us.  All in all, the food and service were solid, and I'd be willing to come back..but I also wasn't blown away by any aspect.",

The portions are large which is great if your going for a family style dining, Prices are a little high but for the amount of food your getting its completely worth it. This is the type of Italian food you expect the traditional large Italian woman (and I mean large large not just slightly overweight but very rotund) to be making food in the kitchen. I have been to Italy two times and gives this place a thumbs up for best Italian food in charlotte - please do yourself a favor and go there maybe even bring your own marshmallows to roast :) .",

We are very relieved to find such good Italian food here in Charlotte, NC...this place is on par with what we were used to having in Northern NJ/NYC and Chicago. Angel hair pasta was cooked to perfection with an absolutely perfect marinara sauce and phenomenal turkey prosciutto meatballs. We also had a lemon, white wine, artichoke chicken; very juicy and served on a bed of fluffy, cheesy, Heavenly polenta. Ratatouille was also cooked and seasoned to perfection and they did a fantastic job with the bread pudding and house made gelato. The portions at Mama Ricotta's are very large, prices reasonable...good drink menu too. We had very comfortable outdoor seating in front of a fireplace and prompt attentive service. I was totally impressed with what a saw in terms of their pizza menu and the indoor wood fired pizza oven which diners can sit near, in a bar type seating style. No question we will be visiting again soon!!",

All of us enjoyed our apps that were pre-ordered, our lunches, and our desserts. I had a small chopped salad with chicken and it was more than filling. Because I didn't know when I'd be visiting again, I had to try the Nutella Pie. It was so freakin' amazing! I shared it with some others at my table and I still had enough to satisfy my never ending sweet tooth with some left to spare. I'm looking forward to the next time I get to go to NC so I can gorge on that Nutella Pie again!",

We decided to try for restaurant week and I think that was a mistake. Waiting I ordered a sangria, something was off and my husband smelt and tasted and agreed. The bartender tasted their mix and said the same so easy enough I substituted for a glass of wine. Got seated on time and sever was super friendly. We ordered all at once. Started with risotto balls they were really good. Then we got the penne vodka which was good but noodles were too al dente. The ravioli also came at the same time but were boarder line cold. The cheese inside was dense and not melted at all. Our server didn't bring the food so we didn't see her for 10mins. Then our food came, husband got chicken parm which was good but really can get that anywhere. I got the pork Ragu and the pork was tender but had no flavor and super dry. After 10mins of waiting for the server to check on us I finally told her and asked for a side of sauce, it took another 15 bc she had to come tell me there was an upcharge then go put it in. By the time it came my husband was done so I just had them pack it up. They said they were still working out the dishes for restaurant week since it was night one? Then we waited over 30 mins for them to bring us precut cake! We were pissed at that point because we had been then for An hour and half. Then the manager came over to basically tell me Ragu is usually dry... um no I get it everywhere and yes it's not saucy but not with a watery sauce with no flavor making the top noodles dry. They gave me the sauce with my box to eat later. The cake was ok kinda dry. Overall not impressed for my first visit. Literally every course but appetizers had an issue. I may try again not during restaurant week we will see.",

The main course took forever to come out! We waited almost 40 minutes. When our main entrees came out it was a total disappointment. I ordered the carbornara pasta which was soooo salty it tasted like someone threw salt in my Mouth! My sister Toni ordered the linguine with meat sauce which was also super salty. My other sister and bf ordered cheese ravioli with meat sauce and chicken parm. Both dishes were over cooked... the ravioli was hard and it was not good. We were all hungry so they all ate their dish but I couldn't even eat mine so told The manager how salty my dish was. He was super nice and offered to remake but by then everyone was done with their dinner and I just didn't feel like waiting longer.  Overall the ambience is great and customer service is great! I would recommend making reservations but def be weary the food is overly salty and you will be waiting a while for your food.",

We also tried the $6 mimosa which was just ok, try the blood orange sangria I promise it's wonderful!!! The longer we were there the more people filed in although one would never notice as the noise level stayed extremely low. The four of us all had a different entree and we blown away by both the taste as well as lunch portion size.

If you could read my mind, that statement would speak for itself, but since you can't (I hope), let me tell you what you're missing if you haven't experienced this appetizer yet.  This is not like any sort of cheesy dip you might have had before.  This is a warm scoop of creamy, delicious cheese covered in marinara sauce, served with perfectly toasted bread.  The challenge here is to get just the right proportion of cheese and sauce in every bite.  We finished off the toast and were still scraping the bowl with bread from the bread basket, which is freshly baked in-house.  I don't even like goat cheese very much, but this blend of cheeses was just right.  I also had the angel hair with tomato basil sauce, which was perfectly done.  The sauce really has to stand out in a simple dish like this, and this sauce was up to the task.  I think next time, though, I might try something a little more complex--maybe the cheese ravioli.",

The patio was being re-done and while I like al fresco dining probably couldn't do it there as it was just too hot for me. The restaurant has a lively, buzzing sound to it. While I won't say it isn't for romantic nights out, it's not a quiet place.   When we sat water was brought over for everyone. The girls ordered a bottle of wine, and we started with an order of calamari. Rhode Island style. The balance between the hot peppers and calamari was perfect. Not over cooked. And a very good flavor. I had a carbonara which I added chicken too. Fiance had a chicken dish that was very good. And my sister did the restaurant week menu. Everything she had was great. Everyone had enough to take home. The service was absolutely phenomenal. Raven was on point, humorous, engaging, and always there when we needed her.   The one negative about this place, and it can't be a negative in a sense, is the Togo is done at the bar and it took me a few minutes to get a drink while waiting for a table. I wish there was another bartender on or someone just for Togo help. When I visit my sister I will try and make it back there again.",

We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share: Tomato and Mozzarella,  Calamari, Chopped Salad, Bruschetta.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  I particularly loved the Chopped Salad.  It had a lot going on, with many ingredients, but it really worked.   For a Main I ordered the Roasted Grouper.  I did not care for the way the fish was prepared. The fish was served with stewed beans, kale, guanicale, and butternut squash. I thought that sounded interesting but I did not like it at all. I did try some of my team mates's dishes. The Chicken Romano was very good. However, the star of the night was the Chianti Braised Short Rib....so tender and flavorful!  We also shared two desserts, a bread pudding and a Nutella pie. Both were sinfully delicious!    The portions were huge!  You can order individual or family size portions. We ordered individual but the portions were large enough to share!  Service was very attentive. They honored our reservation , and our food came out very quickly, especially considering we were a group of ten. Great place to take a group or family!",

    "text": "Oh where do I begin?? I wish that I could rate them 5+ stars because this restaurant is absolutely awesome! I was in the mood for Italian and this spot came highly recommended and I learned firsthand why. From the hostess and customer service, it was one of the best experiences I've had in awhile at a restaurant. Super friendly service, amazing ambience, and dynamite food. Their menu is so full of authentic Italian options that it's hard to decide which is best. Our waiter did a fantastic job with helping us select their most popular entrees. What I loved most about their menu is their portion size options. Even their \"regular\" options are large serving sizes ! Did I mention we were seated right in front of their cozy fireplace??? It was absolutely stunning and warm. You could tell that it was a coveted section because everyone that walked by looked highly disappointed that they didn't get first dibs .  We had way more than enough food to share and take home for leftovers.   This is officially my favorite Italian restaurant!",

I also decided to have a whiskey cocktail and I'm always nervous about cocktails. This one was excellent! Had either Rosemary or thyme and was just perfect.   My husband and I split a salad with salmon on top And the short rib gnocchi. They were both excellent. The short rib fell right off the bone and the gnocchi was full of flavor and pillowy.   Last, we shared Nutella and chocolate pie slices. The slices were huge!!! Definitely preferred the Nutella pie over the chocolate pie.   Service was great and it was just a lovely experience and sit down meal. I'll be back!",

    "text": "Since moving to Charlotte almost a year ago, Mama Ricotta's has been on our radar. I'm very critical with Italian food as I'm constantly comparing the sauces to my Late Elders and my own. Tonight was the True test. We finally made it out to check it out. We made a reservation for Friday night at 7:30pm using Open Table the day before. There was plenty of parking and despite the busy crowd on a Friday night, we were able to be seated right away.  Their focaccia bread and olive oil was a great touch as soon as we sat down. We started with their house made Mozzarella and Tomatoes. The Mozzarella was extremely fresh and seasoned perfectly. My Wife ordered a Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza (of course). It was very good. Nice crust and quality cheese. Sauce was a tad sweet but complimented the fennel in the sausage very well. I had the Chianti Braised Short Rib over gnocchi and fresh kale. It was perfect. Braised 12 hours and you could tell. My folk sliced right through. I didn't even need my knife. The meat just melted in my mouth and the gnocchi were cooked perfectly. We skipped dessert (which all looked and sounded amazing) but My Wife had a cup of coffee and I had an Italian Coffee (spiked). All in all, appetizer, our entrees, 4 Peroni's and our coffees and tip was $100. Well worth it. We'll be back for sure. Saluti!",

On the side was the best vanilla gelato I've had since visiting Italy 7 years ago. This is authentic Italian food folks ... worth the trip and time to go here. The portions are gargantuan, I couldn't finish it, so I'm looking forward to finishing it for dinner. The prices are very reasonable as well. I can't say enough about this place !!!

We ordered the goat cheese app, lasagna, and pollo blanco. The goat cheese dip was so yummy, I will be ordering every time I visit. It was a large portion and came with bread slices and a red sauce. I had the lasagna and loved it. I was fairly full after the appetizer and took most of it home. It took quite a while for the food to come out after the appetizer but nothing to be upset about. Parking was available and loved the interior.",

Like Buca Di Beppo, they offer many of their dishes as large family style options. Unlike Buca Di Beppo, they also offer everything as an entree for one.  And the food is significantly better.    I loved the complimentary bread brought to the table which tasted like small soft dinner rolls brushed with garlic.  The olive oil with a hint of crushed red pepper was a great companion to the bread.  My chicken Parmesan was excellent, although with a slight imbalance between cheese and sauce. (More sauce please!)  All in all, an excellent option for a great Italian meal in Charlotte and one I hope to revisit on a future trip.",

The 1st time the restaurant offered poor quality service and the management was no better to resolve a poor dining experience. I gave them another shot yesterday and the same results. Terrible service. The wait staff is poorly trained and doesn't know the menu. 1 1/4 hour to receive 2 apps. Tje tables around us stayed uncleaned for 2 hours while we dined. The food came out wrong and there were only 5 orders. The replacement dish came out wrong as well. Just a complete mess. I went to look for the management and was nowhere to be found. ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I had to bring my check up to the waitstaff to leave. It is unfortunate that this restaurant is off our list to go back. Food was average but the poor service will keep us from returning. #Disappointeda2ndtime",

    "text": "Came here for a dinner date with the hubs. We has reservations and came in on time. We waited just a few minutes. We got sat in the patio area that's fully covered. Although I don't mind the patio area, it was insanely hot. Almost miserable hot. I was sweating and this was at night during the winter time! I looked around and saw people wearing t-shirts and tank tops. I mentioned something to the server and he said he would ask them to change it and said that if we wanted to eat inside then we would have to wait again for a table. Ugh, annoying.   It was my husband's first time here and I always raved about this place to him. Last time I was here I overheard our server mention the specials to the tables next to me. I don't know if they are doing specials again but we weren't offered any. Kind of a disappointment. We started off with the calamari. They were breaded good and the sauce was delicious. My husband also got the salad. I got the penne alla vodka with chicken and gluten free noodles. My husband got the same thing but with whole wheat noodles. We noticed our food took a little longer than normal. All the tables that got sat after us, after we got our appetizers all got their foods before us. We finally got the food and I was pretty pleased with the gluten free noodles. The texture was good and it was hard to tell that they were gluten free which is a good thing. My husband also liked his whole wheat noodles. During the whole time, our server was pretty distant. I think he was pretty turned off that we complained about the heat. He filled up our waters once and then towards the end he asked about dessert and that was pretty much it.   I'm hoping next time is a better experience. Not just for me but for my husband. I seriously love their penne alla vodka though.",

We were sat right away and given bread and oil. It was ok, I don't think it was typical olive oil, but mixed with something else.   We ordered the calamari, and we split the spaghetti and meatballs. The calamari was good, my favorite part of the meal in fact. Done the Italian way, flash fried, and with marinara. The meatballs were turkey prosciutto, and it just wasn't the same. I tried. My husband said he liked them.   They do have $3 domestic pints on Thursdays which included OMB. My husband was happy about that.  The waitress was good, friendly.",

    "text": "This is not what qualifies as \"Good Italian.\"   Perhaps there is an Italian village where this is identical to what they serve, but I have never been there. I've never been to Italy at all.   So I'll say this instead: This is not what qualifies as \"Good Italian American.\"  I've enjoyed Mama Ricotta's catering before, and even dinner several times over the last decade. But tonight, despite not having to pay, having two glasses of Chianti, and having the gal at the bar give me her phone number, I was disappointed.   Jamal served us with precision and a smile. One busboy was nice enough to crumble bread on my jacket, then look down at my jacket as if its presence offended him.  The rolls...these are dinner rolls, coated in oil. They stiffened within minutes, which generally says they spent time in a microwave.   The oily rolls also came with a dish full of oil. A dish of oil is a decent gesture in most Italian restaurants, but this oil was spicy. And more spicy than I prefer. But if you are from that Italian village where they dip oily rolls in spicy oil, this is your place.   The highly recommended Warm Goat Cheese and Mascarpone Dip was pleasant tasting. Rich marinara surrounding creamy mascarpone, with bread of proper consistency. In fact, I wish they served a version of this bread as their dinner bread. The presentation could be better. Looked like a dying sunflower made of bread.  For the main course, I chose Pasta Primavera. While flavorful, and a big heaping plate, this was also heavy laden in oil. A deep pool of oil.  My benefactor ordered angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce plus shrimp. She appeared pleased, although this may have had more to do with the man across from her, or her drink, or both.   Or neither.",

    "text": "Here's the deal, I've been going to Mama Ricotta's  for over a year. My family has celebrated many birthday dinners here. Why? Because the food truly is outstanding! Now over this past year I have constantly found that that great food is not enough for my to want to be a frequent customer. The service leaves something to be desired to say the least. Just tonight I felt like I should be honored that I could dine at MC's and not the other way around. I'm not looking for a 5 star experience but I am looking to be treated like a customer and not another transaction. My wife and I are pretty easy going as we both worked food service during college. Even tonight when the service was bad we still tip 20%. As we left the hostess couldn't even be bothered to look up from her phone to say have a good evening... instead she mumbled it to the stack of menus. I will continue to visit because I do enjoy the food but I think it terms of customer experience a local chick fil a has them beat x10. This is not the first time my family has felt like this after eating at Mama Ricotta's but I thought it was time to say something. Oh and it was weird that our waitress sat the tea pitcher on the ground near my table and left it sitting there unroll another table asked for a refill... just seems unsanitary.  If your looking for great food it's here as long as you are ok with just being another transaction. For me it just means we don't visit as often and are on the look out for a replacement.",

    "text": "Mama Ricotta's is one of our failsafe, don't miss Queen City picks, so I'm a bit surprised that I haven't Yelped it yet. Maybe I just assumed everyone else already knows how good it is?   The warm garlic rolls with olive oil and red pepper flakes are a welcome starter when you're ready to gnaw your arm off. Last night, our server Danny (who was terrific) added a splash of balsamic to the usual mix, which was a nice addition.  The Mama's side salad is always a refreshing lead-in the main, featuring a quality blend of vegetables and olives. I've tried a few of the house dressings, and as the servers often recommend, the sweet (but not *too* sweet) Italian is their best.   My husband is a diehard fan of the lasagna here, which is a flavor bomb on a plate. Last night, I went for the pasta special - fresh linguine with grouper in a tomato-basil-and-shrimp sauce. Can't say I ever found any shrimp, unless they were disguising themselves as fish, but the sauce was flavorful and fresh, there were plentiful, large chunks of grouper throughout, and the fresh pasta was delightful.  The pizzas here, too, are winners. We especially like Joe's Favorite. Yes, it's full of meaty, greasy goodness, but the house-made sausage is killer.   We ended last night's anniversary extravaganza by splitting the legendary tiramisu. The stuff is made of clouds, I swear. Sweet, coffee-soaked clouds. Mama Ricotta's is some of the best we've enjoyed.  Whether we have family visiting from out of town, or are celebrating a special occasion - as we did for our anniversary last night - Mama Ricotta's is one of our go-tos for a good meal.",

It was a little loud, and people were constantly walking by to get to the restrooms. The waitress had a hard time serving us due to the table configuration (not her fault and she was very attentive). Appetizers and entrees were tasty and plentiful, and the wine pour was decent! I had the penne vodka topped with shrimp, which I can see why it was a signature dish. Leftovers the next day were just as good. The desserts were good, but nothing I haven't had before. The apple crisp (which was my pick) was served so hot that the ice cream quickly became soup and it actually burned my mouth so bad that I had blisters by the time I left. Tasting anything after that was a bit difficult.  I'll go back to try other dishes, as the food was well priced and tasty. I gave this 3 stars because the food and service were good, but couldn't get past my burnt mouth and being crammed into a corner table in the bar area with constant foot traffic area even after making advanced reservations.",

I have to say, the past couple of times I have been eaten at Mama Ricotta's, it has been really great! They have stepped things up a notch or two, that's for sure.  The service is fast, friendly and consistent. The rolls they bring out have not changed. SO HARD to eat just one.  Impossible for some...  They have changed up the menu-adding some modern, lighter options but have kept their golden standards. My favorite is the chopped salad with romaine, gorgonzola, garbanzo beans and walnuts. The walnuts are chopped so finely, you can barely detect them. But they add this subtle nutty crunch that is outstanding. Calamari is great and the warm mascarpone dip is...drool worthy.  My husband always gets the penne a la vodka with chicken---every. single. time. The bites I snag are always excellent!  I also discovered a new favorite wine from their menu--Dreaming Tree Crush.  This red is delicious and subtly sweet.  Very easy to drink (maybe a little too easy).  It's actually a Dave Matthews collaboration!!   If you haven't been to Mama Ricotta's in a while, you're in for a pleasant treat!!",

We made reservations as our group of 7 was fairly large, they accommodated us and even called about 3 times to make sure we were still coming.  With a small dining space I guess they need to ensure their bookings so that they don't end up holding a table when they can really seat customers waiting for a table.  Fresh rolls with olive oil and red pepper flakes were a nice surprise... usually it's just the generic bread with oil and balsamic.  I found it to be a nice twist to an old favorite.  The restaurant itself has an old neighborhood-familiarity to it and everyone working makes you feel welcome and happy that you are there sharing a meal with them.  Its Italian, I don't know about authentic, but the portions are ginormous and the favors are comforting.  I'd say the only crazy thing about the place is the wait since it's so popular, but there are ways around it, reservations... eating an \"early\" dinner.  I'd say the earlier the better since it will give you more time to burn off all the yummy calories consumed.",

I had heard rave reviews about this place and my in-laws were coming into town (who love Italian food) so my husband and I decided to take them to Mama Ricotta's.  Being that it was their 36th anniversary we called ahead to make a reservation and to see if anything special could be placed at the table signifying this event.  We spoke with the manager and spelled out the names of my in-laws and we were told that they would have something put on the table to signify their anniversary (this was after they said they could not print a special menu to say \"Happy Anniversary\").  Anyway, we were feeling good about that and excited to have a little surprise for them.  However, we showed up and there was nothing on the table.  I let my initial disappoint go and continued to be optimistic with the hopes that the food and service would make up for it.  I cannot say that it did.      We started with the Calamari appetizer, which was pretty good, lightly battered and generally fresh tasting calamari.  The garlic bread tasted like store bought dinner rolls, which just are not for me; however the oil with chili peppers and fresh garlic was a nice touch.    On to the entrees, I went with the primavera pasta (one of the only options for a non-red sauce or non-cream based pasta dish), which was in a garlic and olive oil sauce, but it just generally lacked flavor.  My father in-law got the chicken Parmesan, and said he enjoyed it, but he only had about 3 bites out of the 2 pieces of chicken that came with it so I think he was just trying to be nice since we were the ones that picked the restaurant.  My mother in-law had a salad (as she is not a huge eater), which was very nice and she thought it was delicious.  My husband's dish I can say was delicious as well, and may have been the saving grace of the entire meal; he went with the Penne Alla Vodka.  This I would recommend if you like spicy vodka sauce.  On to dessert, I had a Sambuca (which came out luke warm - I prefer it to be chilled) and my husband had a port wine, which was reasonably priced.  My mother in-law got the Kahlua cheesecake which was tasty.  However, after expressing to the waiter that we were there celebrating my in-laws 36th anniversary, he still charged us for the dessert.  On any given day, I, in all honesty, could care less but the fact that they brushed off our request about the anniversary in the first place, you would think that the dessert would be comped.  Oh well, we still had a fun night.  If I go back, I think I will try the pizza, as the pasta truly was mediocre.",

I had the chicken parm and goat cheese polenta & it was very good. Big portion sizes. I tried their chocolate martini & it was SOOO weak they might as well have given me a glass of milk. :(  !

It was a real cold night out, so as we walked by we saw the fireplace roaring out on the patio and a nice table for 4 in front of it. When we walked in, we asked the hostess if we could sit there. She said someone was going to clean it off for us and they'd sit us right away. Another group was also being seated at the same time as us and as we approached the area, the other party of four was deciding if they wanted to switch and go snag our table in front of the fire. I said to our hostess \"Oh no, they're gonna take our table we requested!\" and not once did she step in and tell the waitress in front that she was about to sit us there. So yeah, that was kinda frustrating.  Other than that, our waitress Brie was helpful and had an awesome personality that lightened up our mood after the table incident. Drinks were good, although wine by the glass is pretty pricey. Beers were reasonable. I had the chicken and broccoli penne, which was more than enough and I ended up with lots of leftovers. My husband had the rigatoni with meat sauce. Everything was delicious and we will definitely be back!",

Mama Ricotta's has been in Charlotte for years and definitely is one of Charlotte's better family friendly Italian places. They have a decent sized dining room, a bar around the pizza oven, a regular bar and a nice sized patio that is enclosed in cooler months.    I was here with my dinner group and there were 10 of us and at first our waiter seemed a bit off guard but he quickly got into gear. He explained draft beers are $3 on Tuesdays! Yay! There were 4 selections of which 2 were local of OMB and NoDa.  I went with the ciopino which I thank the Food Network for getting me interested in trying the dish and also ordered a small chopped salad. Even though the restaurant seemed busy, the food came out fast. I was only half done with my salad with the meal arrived. The salad was delicious and probably one of my favorite Italian salads. The ciopino was almost too beautiful to eat but I managed very well.  And then the tiramisu for dessert was light and slightly sweet which is just what I was looking for to finish the meal.  I enjoyed my time here very much. I plan to come back to try their other specialties and pizzas.",

For my dinner I went with the Pollo Bianco, which was phenomenal.  Chicken with prosciutto and mozzarella with a chianti mushroom sauce and a side of mash.  Super delish.  My wife's order was a little less fortunate.  She ordered pasta with marinara and added meatballs.  The pasta and sauce were good, meatballs just okay at best.  Super disappointing after comparing both the app and my meal.  Service was great as always, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back!  Maybe will just order something besides the meatballs next time.",

Unlike a lot of places in Charlotte, they got better over the last 15 years, not worse.  The best way for me to describe their changes over the years has to be: intelligent.  Their growth was intelligent because they kept the items which were successful, and rotated in new favorites while changing with the times.  A lot has changed over the past 15 years regarding what people in America are looking for in food, they've been able to stay relevant while not losing their credibility and identity.  As for value, it is in line with other quasi-casual Italian restaurants around Charlotte, which (IMHO) are all generally over priced, there are some more fairly priced options but you do have to look for them a bit more.  All in all you should not be upset with your experience at Mama's.",

    "text": "I have some mixed feelings about Mama Ricotta's, but ultimately I leave the restaurant pretty happy and satisfied every time.  My biggest complaint is that they took the Butternut Squash Ravioli off the menu... WHY??!?! I truly loved this dish!!  The raviolis themselves were plump and yummy, the squash was rich and creamy, and balanced out with walnuts. Who knows why, no one ever wants to give me a straight answer. Apparently a lot of people still request the dish, so occasionally they will stock the ingredients just to randomly prepare it... but still, I would eat here all the time if they kept this!  Instead I've ordered the Penna Alla Vodka (minus the pancetta) and the Ravioli Alla Fiorentina. These are both pretty good and would definitely recommend them, but they're just not the same!!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Warm Goat Cheese and Marscapone Dip! This stuff is off the chain amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!   I like the dark, cozy feel of the restaurant with drum shade lighting. Thumbs up to the high ratio of booth seating. Worst thing about the decor here are the ridiculous pasta paintings. Good God, the color schemes on these things are hideous. Someone needs to remove those, ASAP.  Service here has been mixed, 85% of the time waiters have been quick, polite, and right on. But I have had an occasional dud.  The prices here are a little high, expect to spend over $12 a person minimum. The good news is they have coupons in the Charlotte Citipass book! Buy One, Get One baby!   Expect a wait on the weekends (10-20 minutes at least). Parking is limited for the volume of weekend customers, so expect a hike.",

While we found out that Amanda was our server but we only saw her serving 2 other tables ajd came to drop off one of our appetizers for less than 30 seconds.  Never introduced herself and never offered us bread like the table next to us.  We had 2 other gentleman drop off food and dessert and then we were left hanging at the end.  We had to bring our own bill to the front to pay and didnt know who to tip.  We tipped Alex since we never heard from any other waiter/waitress.  We asked to talk to a mgr and the girl seemed ignorant, uninterested and not knowledgeable about customer service because she never really apologized and said everyone tries to help out.  But this was not the same experience I saw at the other 2 tables who got the real customer service all customers deserve while we were ignored and discriminated. We are not coming again and it is a shame because the food is not bad.  Very dissapointed.",

Lots of food and lots of fun that way.   We had the Chicken Parm, the Chicken Carciofi, and the Cheese Ravioli. All were outstanding, especially having been preceded with the Tuscan Salad and \"Mama's Salad\". Fanatastico!  Great food and great service. I'll go back again if I'm in downtown Charlotte in the future.",

Ok, people... if you're going to a place named \"Mama Ricotta's,\" you shouldn't be expecting it to be terribly authentic.  But it is much better than Olive Garden.  The food is horrible for you, but delicious.  On our first visit, I had the tortellini special, which really impressed me.  The little pastas were perfectly cheesy, and the meat sauce was amazing.  It actually had little chunks of steak in it instead of ground beef.  My mouth is watering as I write this review, honestly.  The only part of the experience that was less than ideal was the goat cheese appetizer.  It came highly recommended, and it was tasty, but it lacked tanginess.  I probably wouldn't have been as let down if my expectations had not been so high.  Mama Ricotta's is comfort.  Good ol' Americanized comfort.  Mmm.",

The atmosphere is romantic and the service is top notch.  We started with a house made fresh mozzarella snuggled between thick slices of vine-ripened tomatoes, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil.  It came with roasted red peppers and pine nuts.  The cheese was so fresh and delicious!!  We split a bottle of chianti that was very tasty for only $30.  Our pasta dishes came out amazing.  True and authentic Italian food!!!  Our waiter surprised us with a cannoli that had a candle in it and it was the tastiest one I ever had.  Coming from an Italian NY chick, that is saying a lot!!  We will try to go once a month for date night.  Probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte!!",

Started with calamari which was excellent, and our salads were good as well.  It went downhill from there though, when we were brought 2 chicken parm entrees and a lasagna...unfortunately we ordered a pasta primavera, a penne a la vodka, and a lasagna.  The girl that brought the food out brought it back to the kitchen with a confused look, only to return with our sever 5 minutes later with the same food.  The server finally looked at her note pad and realized she messed up the order.  They disappear once again, then 15 minutes later the correct entrees arrived.  The problem now was that the lasagna had clearly sat under a heat lamp while they prepared the other 2 entrees.  The bowl was hotter than the sauce and the outer layers were lukewarm at best.  Was pretty surprised when the bill came with no discounts despite the numerous mistakes.  Overall the entire experience was pretty disappointing.",

Sit down and let me cook you something.\"  That kind of woman, who can cook me something anytime she wants, must be behind Mama Ricotta's.  It's very warm and inviting inside, with bright reds and oranges and fun paintings, while still being dim and intimate.  The great wood stove and friendly staff that greets you certainly sets the stage for the evening.  We started with the goat cheese appetizer which was creamy and decadent, though didn't scream \"goat cheese\" to me.  It was very good, nonetheless.  For my main entree, I got one of the great meat sauce pasta dishes which is everything you expect great Italian food to be.  I was also impressed with the wine list (which comes to you as more of a book than a list) and the many small-production Italian wines that it contains.  Though a little tough to find, given it's strip mall locale, Mama Ricotta's is a must-try!",

We are no strangers to fine dining, so I mean our experience varies from very high end restaurants to your run of the mill Flying Biscuit. We were on our way to Dolce and they were closed for New Years so we headed over to Mama Ricotta's on a whim. Rachel was our server and she was incredible, very sweet, totally knowledgable and seemed like she really loved food.  She was excited about their features, the ingredients used, the fact that they make their bread and mozz in house-just really genuine and lovely.  Our service was spectacular at every single stage. The food runner was delightful, typically they drop the food unceremoniously but he was such a doll and really sweet the few times he stopped by our table. The manager and hostess were both so polite, I was so happy to share our positive feedback with them. My fiance who likes to eat and get the hell out of there was happy to linger over the most incredible tiramisu, it was just so cozy and comfortable!  Ordered the goat cheese and mascarpone app (10 out of 10) the Tuscan salads (10 out of 10) and we each had that Rigatoni (he had the meat sauce, I had vegetarian marinara which was no problem for them.  I graded it a 5/10, just boring and he thought it was wonderful) and the awesome lightly and fluffy tiramisu (10 out of 10)  Next time I will do the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus, we are planning to return this Thursday and I already can't wait!   THANK YOU!",

We called them knowing they were a few miuntes or better away.  We ordered drinks and food for them.  About 5 minutes later the hostess who sat us came back and started trying to talk us into squeezing into a table for 6.  I told her they were down the street and we had just ordered for them so there was no reason to switch.  She said there was another large party that was all here .... Just then the rest of our group showed up.  If they had not I would have left.  The server and the food that night were great and almost made me forget about the hostess.  Then we came again with some friends raving about the food.  Must have been a new chef.  The service was still great but EVERYTHING was really salted. The pizza, the calamari, the pasta. 3 of us ordered a home made pasta with portabello mushrooms, it was so salty we could not eat it. The waitress tried so hard, she apologized and even offered us a free tira misu for desert. Sorry to say cause the servers are great, but Mama's is off our list.",

With this nice warm weather, maybe go on a patio tour-who has the best patio in Charlotte!!!",

They served seasoned rolls that were delicious. Kids went home full and the proportions were good. The White Pizza, Roasted Vegetable Sandwich and The cannolis were amazing. Warm bread pudding and angel hair tomato basil spaghetti were so-so. Im a pretty big guy and the booths have a huge circle underneath that make resting you feet a little uncomfortable.",

After I explained that I would not have driven 5 preteens 30 minutes without a reservation and that I believed it was a mistake, the manager asked me to give him a few minutes to see what he could do.  Within 25 minutes, he had us seated on the patio. Derrick was our waiter and he did a wonderful job of keeping up with us.  What could have been a disaster ended with a happy girl and a happy mom.

You can take your family, a date, do a girls' night, grab drinks, etc. They have a nice little bar area and their new patio is fantastic.   Service is always is great. Super friendly staff.

The food came out very fast afterwards. My friends meal was not what she thought it was going to be and wanted to order something else (paying for both meals) but we never saw our server again. She blatantly ignored us while catering to her 2 tables around us while we shared the one meal after giving up. She was quick to bring the check and didn't say thank you when told to keep the change.",

The servers were very attentive,  friendly and quick.   Our meal was served family style and we had a pre-set menu. The bruschetta was our appetizer.  The tomatoes and basil were fresh on top of a slice of garlic toast. My bread was a tiny bit soggy so this one needed to be eaten quickly. Then we had the Tuscan salad. The house made mozzarella in this salad is to die for.   For our main course, we had turkey prosciutto meatballs, rigatoni with meat sauce, penne,broccoli and chicken, and pasta primavera. The meatballs are huge, like almost as big as my fist. They have a good Italian meatball flavor and you forget It's actually made with turkey. All of the pastas were amazing, each with a different flavor. My favorite was the rigatoni with meat sauce. It had an amazing tomato flavor infused with seasoned meat and the pasta was cooked just right.   My ultimate favorite dish here is the penne alla vodka which we did not have. Most of the time I come just for the penne alla vodka and never try anything else. So it was great to try other foods here.   And again hats off to the staff. They even worked around us playing games between activities.",

Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive. Second, the house made mozzarella was delicious. My wife had the dinner special that was an angel hair pasta dish with cream, ham and peas. She really enjoyed it. Now the bad. I had the grouper. The grouper was a small (obviously frozen) filet over a medley of beans, veggies and kale. The fish was small, thin and bland. The vegetables were significantly over cooked. The dish was $24 and in all honesty it was not as good as a piece of baked/broiled fish from Captain Dees or Long John Silver. I had to put a lot of salt and pepper on the fish as it was just so bland.  Normally I would have no issue sending the food back or telling the server about my dissatisfaction but it was our anniversary and my wife was really enjoying her dinner so I kept mum and ate my fish.  Bottom line for me, when in an Italian restaurant go for a menu item they specialize in but I didn't mention I am not physically able to eat pasta so if I go back it will definitely be a salad dinner for me.",

The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was excellent. I asked for the added scoop of ricotta cheese but it really wasn't necessary with the freshly grated cheese on top. Lots of pasta, it went home in a box and was a full lunch meal the next day.  My wife chose the pork chop special, which was served with sliced apple in a delicious sweet gravy.

Also the waitress was very helpful in helping me figure out which sauce I should get on my ravioli, which I really appreciated. I will be coming back to try more dishes!",

We ask if we can get sausage added in to the penne ala vodka and she says yes. It comes, sauce is thick and paste like. The Italian sausage that was too be added tasted just like smoked game. It was not good. Then we waited and waited again for the bill. Too bad, based off of other reviews we were excited to try it.",

The appetizer was decent, the entrees were also good, not the best I have ever had, but really good overall.   Where this restaurant shines the most is the dessert, every dessert I've had/seen was well priced for the huge portions you get. The cannoli was very good, probably the largest cannoli I have seen, the shell was very fresh and the cream inside was good. I think it could have been more sweet and less ricotta but still I very much liked it.   I definitely will be back, if you go no question get a dessert.",

I've stopped by Mama Ricotta's many a time and, frankly, it's always been at least a good if not great meal. The service has always been friendly (especially in the bar for some reason) and even when things haven't gone perfectly, they have always offered to make it right. Big points here.   Since I've been here so many times, here is a rundown of a few of my personal favorites:  Goat cheese & marscapone dip: Exactly the nom-ness you would expect. Warm creamy dip topped with tasty tomato sauce and served with grilled crostini.  Pasta Primavera: Pretty basic, but a light and colorful veggie angel hair dish. I've only ordered this with the EVOO sauce but I'm always adding extra spice to give it a kick.    Butternut squash ravioli: There is a fancier name to this in house, but you'll see what I mean. Delicious, tender butternut squash raviolis with an orange creame sauce, bits of proscuitto, walnuts and sage. It's ass  on a plate and it's amazing.  It's been a while since I've had dessert here, so I really can't comment on that. However, I have been here for brunch and it was asi asi...but really, Mama, you'll know I'll be coming back. Solid resto, solid food and solid service.",

Sat outside as it was a beautiful day. Early on in the lunch of waiter, \"Derrick\", accidentally knocked a glass of water on my friends lap. Us being pretty laid back, no big deal. Well Derrick took it very seriously apologizing multiple times, gave us a free goat cheese app, which was as good as it was unexpected. And then proceeded to tell us a story about how he dumped a glass of wine on a guys head early on in his waiting experience. He turned a potential disaster lunch, into one of the best I have had.  Now onto the food, all around incredible!! Goat cheese app, fantastic. I got braised beef veg, soup, it was excellent. Had the pasta of the day which was grouper and salmon over spaghetti in a diablo sauce. Also very good. \"Mamas pasta\" with pesto went over very well with my friend.   I can't wait to get back and try the \"New Haven\" style pizza, as I grew up in New Haven, and am VERY picky about my pizza!!",

Our server was Amanda and she was such a sweetheart, very helpful! We both had the Pollo Bianco, chicken wrapped in prosciutto and mozzarella over a bed of garlic mash potatoes (I could eat those things for days), with a vegetable of choice (I had mixed veggies and mom had broccoli- I did not care for veggies) all smothered in a mushroom sauce. DELICIOUSNESS!!! And of course we had to order desert, mom got the tiramisu and I got the apple crisp, both spectacular. But the best part is when \"I went to the bathroom\" but actually was trying to get Amanda, our server, to gather some coworkers to sing my mom happy birthday and a willing young man, Danny, was more than happy too. The two of them really made our night! The service here is great!!! So great that I booked my prom reservations here. The food was great as well! Only downside was no complementary bread, but that's not a big deal overall I would definitely recommend mama ricotta's to anyone!!",

    "text": "Let me be clear: the 2nd star is based solely on the efforts of the staff to turn around our abysmal food experience. Based on food alone it would be a single star, however the staff really tried to make it up to us.  My husband and I ate here this evening. First off we were accosted by a quasi-speed metal song that was completely inappropriate to the setting.   We were seated promptly without a reservation and the waiter quickly took our order.  The server brought some cold, salty garlic rolls. Not an encouraging start to the meal but we plowed ahead -- my husband ordered chicken parmesan and I ordered butternut squash ravioli. The chicken was breaded in what looked to be almost a cracker or corn flake crust rather than breadcrumbs, making it heavy. The plate was just a big pile of spaghetti topped with this chicken wedge glued with red sauce. Not attractive, adequately tasty.  My ravioli was barely cooked. Some parts weren't cooked at all, making an unappetizing paste-y glob. The server was quick to notice something amiss and  quickly replaced the plate with another entree, the eggplant parmesan. Way too salty and an unholy mess of cheese and overcooked spaghetti.  The side of spinach was also much too salty and I finally threw in the towel, completely defeated by this awful meal. Maybe it was an off night but the people around us didn't seem to be having the same issues with their meals. If this is the best Italian food that Charlotte has to offer, than I am forewarned.   The manager came over and asked if there was anything he could do, offered to comp us a dessert and generally tried to make things right. It was unfortunate that the meal was unsalveageable.",

I drink a lot of soda or sweet tea, and I often run dry. I resort to sending signals (ignored) like putting my glass on the edge of the table and making puppy-dog faces. Sadly my cute face is wasted here.  The food is good. I always spoil my meal with the bread and pepper-olive oil starter they bring.  As a vegetarian there are few, few options. In fact, I have only ever had 1 dish every time I have visited.  For a place that is trying to be 'nice' it would be better to update the menu periodically, and make some dishes vegetarian or at least allow them to be adapted.  The atmosphere is sorta stuffy, but I suppose typical Charlotte. People are dressier here than you would expect for lunch, but likely due to bankers coming on lunchtime and nearby Ladies Who Lunch from Myers Park.",

    "text": "Mama's is participating in Restaurant Week with a four-course meal for $30.00.  I took a peek at the menu and thought I'd give it a whirl.  I made reservations (which were probably not necessary) through Open Table for early Sunday evening.  I was seated immediately and my server came out to take my drink order.  There were three options for the first course, two for the second, four for the third and three dessert options for the final course.  I made my selections and the waiter left to put in my order. He returned quickly with what appeared to be some soft yeast garlic rolls with some olive oil for dipping.  Soon the bruschetta, my first course, arrived.  It was the tastiest bruschetta I've ever had.  Heaps of diced tomatoes and basil protecting two pieces of toasted Italian bread, drizzled with olive oil.  They set the bar high up front.  Unfortunately, the next course didn't meet the same status.  I had chosen the penne a la vodka pasta which was rather mild in taste.  The one saving grace was the pieces of pancetta scattered throughout the dish.  The third dish helped bring us back closer to our starting point.  The veal milanese was very simple with a veal cutlet pounded out, lightly breaded and fried, topped with arugula, cherry tomatoes and Parmesan cheese.  The cutlet was huge and left me enough for dinner the following night.  I ended my meal with the nutella pie, a delightful combination of nutella, marscapone, and peanut butter in a graham cracker crust.  Fantastic.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  The location was a little difficult to find, but it's worth the reward.",

The service (especially this one server) I don't know his name but he is the really muscley bald one...Yeah he's my favorite. Everytime my boyfriend and I go there we pray we get him b/c he is delightfully friendly and accomodating. He practically jumps to fill up your water, get you the best dish, seat you in the best lighting, whatever it is that you want he'll get it for you. We really love him.   3. The food above all is one of the best Italian places in Charlotte. I love their penne a la vodka, calamari, and fish. The nutella pie is a slice of death it's so good!!! It is also alarmingly large...I say eat some there and take it home for later!",

I stopped by Mama's for dinner last night and ordered some of the goat cheese dip and the spiedini di carne salad.  Great choice.  I was intending to go for a light dinner when I came in but ended up stuffed.  The goat cheese was the primary culprit.  Very savory.  The salad was solid as well.  The steak was delicious and enjoyed the many flavors the rest of the salad contained - full of grapes, tomatoes, olives, cheese.  Very satisfying!",

    "text": "I have to preface with the fact that I'm not a huge fan of Italian food.  I was unimpressed with the customer service: the server was apparently not typically on the floor as she was the bartender. My first question is \"Why?\" She got our order incorrect (which actually ended up being a good thing) but was a bit slow.  I usually like all salads but I did NOT like the chopped salad. For some reason, the acidity was too high and some of the flavors did not bode well together.    My friends raved about the Nutella pie: it was good but it was much more like a Cheesecake Factory cheesecake slice than a pie: huge and don't order more than one per table--too much. For dinner, we ordered the Pollo Bianco and since we both wanted it, we decided for family style. The family style doesn't come with side dishes so you have to order those separately--so we did. But then they brought the single serving and still brought the sides--and the single serving is served on top of mashed potatoes: one of the sides we ordered. Enter double sides of mashed potatoes. I will say the sauce of the chicken was good, but the mashed potatoes were the same as anywhere else.   I guess it's just another standard chain restaurant. Too bad. It could have been so much more.",

Beth, behind the bar, is so nice and really knows her stuff. The food. Ok, I'm jumping straight to dessert. Nutella  pie!! I could stop my review right there and still be at a 4 star. That's the real deal. The angel hair pasta dish does not disappoint. It's the pizza that has won my heart. The first time I ordered it, I glanced at the price for a large, 14 inch pie and was surprised at the almost $20 price tag but said to myself, everything else here has been unbelievable, so I'm going for it. Reminds me of the scene in Pulp Fiction when Vincent Vega asked \"Is that a $5 milkshake? We're talking milk and ice cream, right? (after tasting it), That's a great f*%@ing milkshake\".  Yep, you get what you pay for! I ordered the Joe's Favorite (no, it was already named that when I arrived). The homemade sausage is out of this world good. Great crust, wonderful flavor. One of the best pies I've ever had. Can't wait to go back again!",

I was asked to give them another try by 2 fellow foodies, mainly because they made the signature bread pudding sound so good and there was a $20 certificate for $5 on juice in the city.....that is the only reason I returned after all this time. I'm not sure how this place has been here as long as they have, I mean let's be honest.....the food is sub par. Again, I am a lover of Italian food and if your signature rigatoni with meat sauce can't even compete with stouffer's.....that's a problem. I mean the noodles were hard and chewy, the sauce was salty and the bread was tasteless....this is a basic Italian dish which I would think could never be screwed up........geez! The penne alla vodka was also full of salt with hard and chewy noodles......glad I only paid $5 bucks! The bread pudding, which is not on the menu, gave me something to smile about after a bad meal.......It was covered in caramel sauce I think and served with ice cream.......very good...........to bad they're not a dessert bar.",

The problem is that they don't really set them selves apart from what your average Italian girl (or guy) ::raises hand:: can actually make in their home.  The pasta special, a tilapia, shrimp and scallop spaghetti dish with a slightly spicy sauce, was the exception to this rule. It had a delicious sea flavor and I regret not having ordered it as my dinner. My penne vodka sounded enticing, promising pepper vodka and including pancetta, but the sauce ended up being unsensational.  Looking at the rest of the menu, I saw a lot of familiar characters: lasagna, angel hair with red sauce, and chicken romano to name a few, but few options that jumped out and screamed that I needed to try it.  I love Italian food at least as much as the next girl but if I am going to go out for it I want to be impressed and while Mama Ricotta's provided a good meal it didn't shine.",

Tonight was my second visit, and I can firmly say, \"I am not in love.\"  My first meal at MR was lunch with coworkers. I ordered a calzone. The crust was bland and the filling seemed sparse. I was underwhelmed but my coworkers raved about their dishes. I figured I should just order something else next time. C'est la vie.    Tonight, a friend and I headed over to MR for dinner. I started off with bruschetta that tasted freshly made but had an overpowering acidic/vinegar flavor. The bread was already soggy like it had been sitting for a bit. My friend had calamari that she didn't care for at all.  We both ordered slow cooked brisket (I think the waitress said about 7 hours.) with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes. The entree was good, and the portion was huge...more than enough for two people. Leftovers are in my future. Of everything I've had at MR, this was the best. Still, I wasn't blown away by it. It was just good, not great.  On each visit the wait staff has been very friendly and attentive. Our waitress from tonight (wish I could remember her name) was super friendly and helpful. She did a great job.  My friend and I weren't complaining about the food but our waitress asked so we told her what we though of it. And the manager came out to tell my friend the calamari would be removed from her bill, and offered her a free dessert, which was a very responsible and nice gesture. I was mildly annoyed because I don't think she even acknowledged my presence. At this point it didn't even matter. I don't see a return in my future.   I don't eat a lot of Italian food but next time I'm in the mood, I'm on to the next one.",

It's like a weird mutant baby of Ruby Tuesday and the Cheesecake Factory born in 1994 - I swear they even have the same mix of fun n' funky jams you've heard in your favorite RT's playing in the background. They most definitely have the same feel - messy food paintings full of edgy, contrasty colors, that damn jewel tone color scheme that immediately calls to mind fancy Mall, opulent textures bandied about, willy-nilly. I've given Mama's three chances to transcend the bad decor choices with delicious foods, and she's failed me, every time.  Dinners - universally too salty, and if salts-everything-before-tasting-it me is saying that, well. This preserved, pickled thing is inescapable - if it isn't a preserved roasted pepper overwhelming your salad, it's a pickled artichoke or so many Kalamatas (yay Greece) smothering your pizza that any chance of digging on the housemade mozz is gone. Even Bruschetta tastes like it's been doused with anti-aging liquids and sat at the bottom of a very deep fridge for who knows how long.  In True Olive Garden style, salads are overdressed before making it to your table, so it's all a wilty, mixed up mess. That ain't how they do it in Italia, kids! That's how they do it in Bottomless Breadstickville.  Service is probably where they've spent the most energy and it shows - people are quick, smiley, knowledgeable. But try three was brunch this weekend, and the Benedict was so Stouffer's (accompanied by the blandest breakfast taters I've ever not eaten, and seriously, what cheese was that under my two asparagus spears, Muenster? Srsly?!) that, like I said, I give up. Che cosa una delusione.",

One of my best friends worked here during my first years of college so logically (with the food discounts and everything), we would come here for lunch or dinner a lot. If I could fall in love with a restaurant, it'd be True love between  me and Mama Ricotta's. Apparently a lot of others feel the same way so maybe Mama's is cheating on me. Oh well. I'll tolerate it this time- I'm still in that infatuated stage and I don't think it's ending any time soon. I always have a ton of options here and everything is always absolutely perfect. I usually hate eating pasta with only tomato sauce and no grated cheese, but I was forced to try their angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce WITHOUT parmesan cheese and it was perfect. I was truly amazed. Who knew tomato sauce could be so good that you don't need or even WANT cheese?! And the tiramisu? In the past, I've personally described it as the equivalent of a tiramisu-flavored cloud. Perfect texture, perfect combination of flavors and perfect density. Best tiramisu 've ever had by far.  However, with that said, I am bummed about two things. First off, their Mama's Pasta is NOT on the  menu anymore. Apparently they can still make it, but it's by special request only. Also, the tiramisu has been lacking in cloud-like quality the last two times I've gone in to eat. It could be that I'm just getting the last slice of it or maybe they just changed their recipe. Either way, I've been slightly disappointed. Hopefully it'll be back to the same thing next time I go. *fingers crossed*",

There aren't a lot of little hole-in-the-wall Italian places like Mama Ricotta's around these parts, so it was a wonderful day for me when I found this spot.

The ravioli alla Fiorintina is one of my favorites from the pasta menu, as well as the penne alla vodka (hold the pancetta for me).   I've never had bad food at Mama's, and I can be kind of a snot about Italian food. I studied abroad in Florence just to be able to be an Italian food snob and to pronounce things elegantly off Italian menus...I'm still paying for the privilege every month!

I hosted an event where I work (hush hush on that topic), and for the first time, used Mama's for the catering. I have been working here for 2 1/2 years, always cater events and this was, by far, the best catering I have ever received!!!  Okay, so the staff was very friendly, professional and timely (# 1), the display looked great and we had zero issues with quantity....those are things I expect out of most catering companies......the biggest thing you worry about is the quality and freshness of catered food.   You usually think: cold, over-heated, dry....and your usual statement is \"it was good, FOR catering\"  NOT the case this time, it wasn't just good for catering, it was extremely fresh, delicious and good, for consumption.   The menu: stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped scallops, passed shrimp cocktail ( in mini martini glasses, cooked, chilled, snapped to perfection), two types of pastas with a pasta station (nice and hot to order), prime rib carving station (perfectly pink inside),  bbq pork sliders, fresh vegetable display, gourmet cheese platter,spin/art dip, chopped salad and fresh fruit.......  It was ahhh mazing and my client thanked me over and over again and raved about the food (yesssss)  Not to mention, the cost is very reasonable, even with a private chef on site. If you ever need catering for an event, I highly recommend Plate Perfect Catering!",

Had chicken park family size, included 5 pieces of chicken parmigiana and a side of angel hair pasta that was enough for 5 or more people. Had a very good wine selection. Recommend making a reservation but even as a walk in we were seated very fast. Absolutely worth the visit. Feed 4 people and took leftovers home for tomorrow.",

We each ordered something different and tried each others. Angel hair pasta,  lasagna,  rigatoni and ravloni. We also got a couple of meatballs which were to die for. The calamari was some of the best I've had with excellent marinara sauce.  This place is the whole package.  Excellent food, fast friendly service and good background music to boot. Loved the place, if I lived here I would be a regular!",

When we were notified that table was ready, we were seated back outside in an open area, still hot and nats flying everywhere.  The manager explain there was a wedding party and no seats available inside.  We asked to be moved to the other side where the fans were blowing so the bugs would not get all over the food and was told as soon as table was ready we could.  A second waiter came out to discourage us from moving in a very condescending manner.  We did the appreciate the service and left.  Disappointed with service, lack of accommodation and only got to taste  a piece of bread before the nats took it.   It would be nice if you could wait in a cooler area also",

    "text": "We attended a planned birthday party of 25 people. I was surprised at how well it worked...from the delicious food to the exceptional service. Our main servers Cori and Abby were prompt with taking drink orders as we arrived. As soon as we all arrived and were seated, the salad course was served. Demands for bread refills were met with a swift response. As soon as the salad plates were cleared, our pasta course arrived. And before we could recover from that course, the tasty meat course arrived. Our experienced servers knew to anticipate our need for coffee in preparation for the final dessert course.   Maybe my multiple trips to Italy create a level of expectation higher than reasonable. The penne pasta with creamy pesto sauce was disappointing and not up-to-par with their other dishes...I've had better from Pizza Hut. The alternate pasta dish (cream sauce, broccoli and penne) was excellent.  All were impressed by how well our large party was managed. There were many opportunities when there could have been hiccups in the service or our dinner could have been uncomfortably long. If I had to select a couple of words to describe the service...I'd choose \"professional\" and \"polished\". I'd definitely recommend this venue to anyone planning a large dinner event.",

The meat option to add to the primavera is not worth it, as I find the chicken as well as the shrimp to be rather bland. Additionally, the wait it never long and the staff is friendly. For $9, this is an economical lunch option.  During dinner, the line isn't usually too long. The food is delicious and the pastas are very hearty. I recommend the lasagna, as the portion size is filling. My favorite appetizer is the goat cheese and mascarpone dip. If you're not sharing, this could be a meal in itself. Best part of any meal are the garlic rolls. 2 bites size, warm, soft, and garlicky of course.",

The $35 Pre-Fixed menu featured 4 courses including an appetizer, a small pasta sampling, an entre, and a dessert. They also offered 20% off wine bottles if you were ordering from the Restaurant Week menu (nice touch!).   I ordered the arancini appetizer (fried rice ball) because they are so unique to Italian restaurants. They were crunchy and delicious in a really good authentic red sauce. Most of my friends had salads which looked incredible. I'd come back next time just to eat those! They were full of fresh ingredients and all looked to be well dressed. The pasta samplings that came next were equally as amazing. I had the cheese ravioli and I could have eaten those until the end of time. I also had a bite of a friends penne with vodka sauce and I thought it was great. Delicious, authentic dishes.   Next came the entrees. The waitress said that the beef selection was the most popular, but we all felt that we had been led astray. It was good, not great, and felt more like a stew. The chicken dish was the clear winner and favorite amongst our group. We all left with a little regret on that one...  Dessert was a choice between a vanilla bean panna cotta or a chocolate cake. Skip this and drink more wine or get more pasta! They just weren't that good. I really dont know what more to say. Just kind of blah...  Overall great Italian atmosphere. Amazing pastas. Great for a group of friends!",

The ambiance feels warm and inviting with a touch of upscale flare. The lighting is dark unless you're on the screened in patio which is always a fun spot in the summer.   The restaurant is also great for those with dietary restrictions, and very accommodating.   Now on to the food recommendations: The penne alla vodka is a MUST every time I go but you really cannot go wrong with anything you choose. I also love the chicken parm - the portion size is pretty generous, as well. Lastly, I will suggest that calamari as one of my favorite appetizers. Can't go to Italian and not get calamari!",

I had the Veal Marsala, my wife and grandson had the Chianti braised (tender, melt in your mouth) short rib, son had porcini mushroom/beef tip and fettuccine Marsala.  Everything was cooked to near perfection. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would. Almost forgot, all wine priced less than $65/btl was 50% off, so we had an awesome Pinot noir from the Willamet Valley, OR.",

This dish was a no brainer as it's the most popular item ordered at Mama Ricotta's and it's been awhile since I've had Italian food, so I was eager to try their pasta. I absolutely love penne noodles, and these were tossed with sauteed pancetta in a pepper vodka with spicy tomato cream sauce. The option to add chicken, shrimp, or salmon is available, but I wanted to fully taste just the pasta and sauce together. Opted out on the parmesan cheese grater too. Sometimes keeping it simple is best. Paired this with a thin crust white pizza that was cooked in a wood-burning oven. Both very good entrees at Mama's. Also, the Chianti braised short rib is awesome. Twice a year for Mother's Day & Easter, they do an all you can eat Sunday buffet, so you can gorge on all the Penne Alla Vodka you want. Mark your calendars.",

It makes for a nice romantic dinner spot. They started us off with some dinner rolls and some olive oil dip. We gobbled that up pretty quickly.   My fiance ordered the pasta primavera with cream sauce and I got the cheese ravioli with tomato basil sauce. Both were absolutely delicious!! Cooked to perfection. My mouth is watering just thinking about it especially that cream sauce. When they give you your dish, the waiter will ask how much cheese you want on it (like how they do at Olive Garden). I've never been to a real Italian restaurant so I don't know if they do this with all places or not. Either way, we loved it here and can't wait to go back whenever we're in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Bruh. Why have I been living so close to Mama Ricotta's and still never been there (until now, my mistakes have been rectified).  The weekends are for eating out for The Lady and I, and I maintain that Sunday night is still part of the weekend. So we look through our Yelp bookmark list, and The Lady finds Mama Ricotta's.   Let me preface all this with the fact that Italian food has never been my favorite. I'm not a pastaholic. I frankly don't like lasagna. I do love pizza though...   I oblige to Mama Ricotta's because a) our friends have raved about it and b) Frank Scibelli can honestly do no wrong. I cautiously put our name on reservation via OpenTable and I find that there's only like 3 timeslots available - on a Sunday night?!? Yup. We arrive there about 45 minutes before our timeslot and it's PACKED. Luckily there's a huge parking lot that's more than accommodating for the entire shopping center.  We walk in to a very cozy environment, and a friendly waitress that looks as flabbergasted as we are about the amount of people there on a Sunday. The Lady and I aren't picky about a table, and when two seats at the bar (which really isn't a bar, but a pizza station), we take it. Full service bar seats are my jam.   We go through the dilemma every group has with favorites such as \"do we order drinks here or wait until home\" and \"do we need dessert?\" We decide to split a drink, a gin and tonic type drink with house made limoncello (bestill my heart) and man was it refreshing. So impressed. For dinner, The Lady ordered Pasta Primavera with the tomato basil sauce, and I, a nonpastatarian, ordered the Pollo Bianco. It's super tender chicken covered in a layer of prosciutto and mozzerella and it has this red wine mushroom sauce... *shivers*. Y'all, it was SO good. The Lady enjoyed hers a ton too, I just didn't get to try any haha.   As predicted, Mama Ricotta's left us both with leftovers for one meal each, making the price point totally worth it, and the quality of food was outstanding. I cannot wait to go back, next time with friends, and try more items. I gotta say, I wasn't a believer, but now, \"It's Amore...\"",

    "text": "Ah how refreshing: REAL ITALIAN FOOD IN THE SOUTH! I've been wanting to check this place out for so long, but there was always an excuse, so one Sunday night the hubs and I just decided to go for it. He made a reservation around 5pm for an 8pm seating for two, but we decided to get there early and just see what happened. After finding parking quicker than I expected, we checked it, and then within 10 minutes, two seats at the pizza bar opened up and we simply sat there. Not only did we get seated faster with full service, but we also got to watch and talk to the woman making the brick oven pizzas.   Having just had pizza a few nights prior, however, I decided to go for some traditional red sauce pasta (surprisingly not often had in our household). I ordered the Pasta Primavera but with red sauce instead of the traditional oil-based. So it was almost like a bolognese meat sauce, but with veggies instead of meat. There was a good variety of veggies and therefore flavors and then the sauce and pasta were excellent. The portion was good too as I was able to get two meals out of it.  The hubs and I also shared a cocktail: a limoncello fizz with homemade limoncello.... yummmmmmmm.  The only thing I will note is that by sitting at the pizza bar, you are very close to the front door, and the opening and closing can make it a little cold and drafty.... especially when a group of 18 comes in without a reservation and just stands around (True story).",

We had made a reservation a week prior, yet when we arrived, we were told that there was no reservation. Not for tonight or any other night. When we told them that we wouldnt try to show up for a 7pm dinner on saturday night with 5 preteen girls for a birthday party without a reservation, they seemed to understand our issue and took great care to handle it. We ended up waiting for only about 10 minutes to be seated at a great table on the patio. The FoH manager communicated well, and did everything he could to take care of us as quickly as he could. It was a great save on his part.  Derrick, our server, did a great job of keeping us happy once we sat down. No water glasses were ever empty, our food came out on time and delicious, bread baskets were refilled as needed, and our table was cleared as the check was being presented. We had cheese ravioli, rigatoni, shrimp scampi, pollo bianco, and pasta primavera and it was all very very good, served family style which is a great treat.  This could have been an ugly night with a long wait or going from restaurant to restaurant after a simple clerical error. Instead, they pulled together to make our evening special and we very much appreciate it. Thank you Mama Ricotta's!",

Only complaint was that the chicken breasts were a bit too thick and therefore felt underseasoned  Place has great service and atmosphere for a family or group dinner and left happy and full.",

They were white rolls you buy at the grocery store with seasoning put on top. WHITE ROLLS.  My entree was under cooked and my friends entree was not fresh.Proudly hanging in the restaurant were  awards and reviews of MR from 2008. When I ate at MR long ago, it was top notch, not the same restaurant now. I was embarrassed for Mama Ricotta's.",

The bread and oil were good, but the waiter was very puzzled by the request my cousin made to add grated cheese to the oil. The beer choices could have been better, but that is a perennial concern I have at most restaurants in Charlotte. Portions were reasonable, sauces good. It was a happy surprise to find out that the owning family was from the same area of NYS as we were, and we had a nice little exchange about \"home\". Desserts were killer. I was completely oblivious to the decor or muzak....but I was pretty much engulfed in a catching-up conversation with my cousin! I plan on driving into town again to eat here...but since I live an hour out, it's not feasible for me to commute in *just* to eat very often. This is a place I would take guests to.",

Everyone I know loves it, and sure, it's acceptable and reasonably priced, they can handle larger parties with a little advance notice, and the service is always fast and friendly.   I just wish the food were more memorable, I think. Standard fare, really, and executed without major flaws (though on some nights, yes, it can be a wee bit saltier than you might wish), but nothing to write home about.   Sometimes, I'll get this \"let's go to Mama Ricotta's!\" urge. Every time I do, I wonder \"now, why did I want that so badly?\"   I'm never really able to answer. I guess there's something comforting about mediocrity.",

Beth has waited in me twice and I thinks she may be one of the nicest people that I have ever met! She knows the menu inside and out and has recommended some outstanding dishes. The first dish she suggested was not on the menu as it was the chef's special. It was a pasta with a braised beef that, I kid you not, was so tender and delicious that I very nearly wept! On my second visit she Nrecommended a chicken dish that reminded me if those Sunday dinners with grandma. You know, when the food is so good and comforting that you just can't push yourself away from the table! Honestly, this is some of the best italian food that I have ever eaten! It compares with some of the meals that I have had in Boston's North End. I almost forgot to mention the Nutella Pie...Oh Dear God ! It is heavenly!",

I also got the side salad which came with a really great homade sundried tomato dressing (also the salad was under $3 which you don't find anywhere these days).  My boyfriend had the penne with meat sauce which he liked, but his portion was noticably smaller than mine- I think the meat entrees are prob a better deal.  The entire meal came with half a dozen garlic rolls, on the house.  Oh, beware that if you go on the weekends this place is packed- I could barely get to the bar to get my to go order.",

Low lighting creates a classic, relaxing atmosphere that is also suitable for families (meals can be served family style if you like).  The classic dishes are fantastic, but I haven't had great luck with the more original dishes (pork with grapes, while it sounded good on the menu, was not so tasty after all).  My food did come out burned once, but the waiter responded so apologetically and the turn around on a new dish was so fast that it didn't matter.  The manager came by shortly after as well and I think my meal was free  - customer service here is key.  It reminded me that a mistake in the kitchen won't ruin your meal if the people who work there care enough to fix it (looking at you Cabo Fish Taco!)",

We arrived prior to the \"lunch rush\" (around 11:30) and at first, the staff was attentive and we got our drinks right away. I ordered a salad with my entree, which came out with no problems and fairly quickly.   I cannot say as much for the rest of the meal.It was all downhill from there. We then proceeded to wait for almost 20 minutes for our food, which is no big deal if it is busy, but two things: 1) we arrived and placed our order BEFORE the actual rush started and, 2) we watched as 16 people at various tables around us, who arrived WELL after us, had their food come out and were almost finished eating -  and we still hadn't had ours yet. When we inquired about the food - TWICE - the waitresses (there were two - one was clearly a trainee - who is NOT learning good food service techniques for this establishment) kept explaining that it was \"really busy\" and we were there during the \"rush.\" Finally our food came out, but not before one of us went to speak to the manager. He was apologetic, but then as soon as our colleague walked away, I saw him talk to the two waitresses and all 3 looked at our table and laughed. REALLY?? Is that how you conduct yourself as a manager/owner?? RUDE!! I believe his name is Frank.   While he apologized, he never offered any kind of compensation, as I would expect when you make a huge mistake and treat your customers rudely - at the VERY least. Not even a, \"I'm so sorry for your bad experience, we will take care of your _________.\" Now, I am not a restaurant manager or owner, but I AM a savvy diner and I do frequent several establishments owned by the same people. When I say frequent, I mean EVERY Friday. I am considering not going back to any restaurant owned by them (Bad Daddy's, Cantina 1511, Paco's Tacos...) because of how rudely we were treated and dismissed. Frank needs to go back to business management and learn how to treat his customers, especially if he would like them to return.  I will not be returning here, if I want mediocre Italian food, I'll go elsewhere. Like one reviewer below mentioned, this is just a step above Olive Garden. I have been to Italy and this food is nowhere near \"authentic.\" If you want real Italian food, do yourself a favor and go to Dolce. You can actually hear them speaking Italian in the kitchen. And I have never had anything less than stellar service there.",

We had enough food for both of us and a little to take home for leftovers. We also ordered some type of cheese bread, without realizing they give you complimentary bread...so it was bread overload, but who can complain about that?

The lunch prices are perfect- you get a lot for what you order. As for the dinner prices I'm not so sure. They looked a bit pricey to be getting the same serving size. I ordered the primavera pasta because I saw it in yelp. Boy was is tasty! Lots of veggies , how I like. I didn't get any protein added and I glad I didn't because you really don't need it . I was given 3 sauce options and I choose the basil and tomato sauce - as the waitress recommended. The staff was extremely attentive, service was exceptional!

    "text": "Once again I had an amazing experience at Mama Ricottas. I made a reservation on open table via the restaurants website and it was so easy and convenient.  We started off with the Goat cheese and marscapone dip because - of course! It's so amazing, I always order it. My main entree was the Pollo Bianco, a delicious chicken breast dish served with melted mozzarella, prosciutto, and a mushroom cream sauce. It was served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and steamed squash and zucchini. This meal was melt in your mouth delicious. My friends loved their dishes as well, one of which was the same Pollo Bianco and the other was the Pollo Carifoci. Not sure if I spelled that right but she loved it. This dish was chicken with artichokes, capers and a lemon butter sauce - their version of chicken piccata.   Dessert was great, however I did get it to go because I was stuffed! Chocolate cannoli cake. Absolutely amazing.   Our server Abbi was attentive and extremely welcoming and did an amazing job.   We will be back as soon as possible!",

    "text": "My family and I went to Mama Ricotta's for Mother's Day dinner this past Sunday. I made a reservation through opentable which apparently didn't go through properly, however the host was very accommodating and able to get us a table on the patio. I do not hold the faults of open table against them. I want to start by saying that for the most part, the food was excellent. My mom had the penne a la vodka and it was amazing. I had the chicken parm which was also very good. This being said, my daughter's meal was ice cold (it was a grilled cheese) by the time the replacement came out everyone had already finished their meal and she was full from eating off everyone else's plate. The reason I am giving this place two stars is because of the service. Being that it was a holiday none of us were expecting the service to be super speedy, but our server was not only slow, but not attentive and rude. He never once wished us a happy Mother's Day, he didn't introduce himself, instead of asking what anyone wanted to drink he just brought waters, and anyone who wanted anything else they had to take it upon themselves to order it. If we needed a refill, we had to wave the server down and ask for it. Not to mention the fact that he came and refilled our water glasses with warm water. (We we're sitting on the patio where it was 80 degrees). He was not the server who delivered our food, and he never followed up to even ask us how our food was, or if we needed anything else. It was only after we complained to the manager that he even came to our table. The manager addressed the issue with the server, and he returned with a very sarcastic tone making sure to emphasize how our water now had ice in it and was cold. Our servers name is Stewart. It is because of him that I, nor anyone in my family, will return to this restaurant. This is a shame considering how good the food is, but being paying customers, I believe we deserve to be treated much better than that. If you do go to this restaurant and you have Stewart as a server have zero expectations of good service. I will also be posting this review on Facebook and google, because of how offended I am by how my family was treated.",

    "text": "My husband and I eat here about once a week and have enjoyed many meals here. Tonight, we were seated on the outside patio in a half booth in which the booth side was entirely facing the blinding sun at 5pm. We asked the waiter to pull the shades but apparently due to poor design there are no shades. The \"manager\"came over and stated that she was sorry but there were no other seats available and that we would basically have to just wait it out until the sun went down. Um, not what I expected to hear. I stated she would need to move us or we would be leaving and never returning. Also, that they should never have seated people there, knowing the sun was an issue that makes it impossible to enjoy your meal. The manager proceeded to argue with me and finally stalked off after wishing us a \"nice evening\" in the most sarcastic way possible.  A table across the way opened up and we were reseated there within a few minutes. NOTE TO HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND MR. SCIBELLI: Please retrain your management staff to handle these types of situations appropriately and with care. You are no longer the only Italian game in town and patrons have many choices over where to spend their dining dollars. I frequent Pacos Tacos and management there is exemplary and handles any problem with ease. I have spoken to several of the older managers here at Mama's in the past, and have complimented them but this manager was quite typically a \"millennial\" with the attitude and lack of skills to match. Please consider your long time patrons when hiring or they will simply go where service is taken seriously!",

It has some spice to it and comes with pancetta that adds good flavor. It's one of the better versions of this dish that I've had.   We branched out this time and also got a pizza--Joe's favorite. It was pretty good, but probably not good enough for me to get it again.   If you're looking for solid Italian food in Charlotte, this is a good place to come.",

    "text": "**originally posted on my blog before I joined yelp**  I've been to Mama's now 3 times, and each time I go it gets better.    Actually, for a nice dinner out, Mama Ricotta's is very reasonable.  They offer family sized entrees to share and I've never left there when we all weren't full as a tick.  Also, the restaurant is lively and nearly always crowded.  You would probably do well to get reservations on a Friday and Saturday night.  We've always been well taken care of by our servers, too.  SALADS and SIDES  The Caesar Salad is a classic Caesar with cheese, croutons and dressing.  The dressing is tangy and delicious, and the romaine was crisp and fresh.  My only complaint was that the darn thing was perhaps too cheesy.  Is that even a problem?  But it really was overloaded, I'd prefer a bit less next time.  My dinner companion ordered a side of roasted vegetables.  They were grilled over the wood fire, very simply prepared, and very fresh.  MAIN COURSES  The pizza is not thin and crispy, and not deep dish.  It is made in a wood burning oven so it gets lightly charred on the bottom and remains chewy on the inside of the crust.  The toppings that you choose (we've tried Italian sausage, chicken sausage and prosciutto) take on that smokiness from the oven, as well, for a rustic flavor.  My only complaint is with the house-made chicken sausage.  Our order had far too much anise in the sausage, making it taste very licorice like.  I'd not get that topping again.  The Penne alla Vodka is perfect by itself, and a great favorite of the restaurant.  You honestly cannot taste the alcohol, either.  It's a very creamy tomato sauce which is perfect with the penne pasta.  I've had it with both shrimp and chicken and both are delicious additions.  The shrimp is cooked perfectly, not at all rubbery.  The chicken is tender and flavorful.  This is one of my favorite dishes.  Spaghetti and Meatballs is a staple at most Italian restaurants, and these meatballs were no exception.  They were tender and savory, clearly simmering in the warm tomato sauce for a long time.  The pasta was also perfectly cooked, with the tomato sauce having just enough acidity to counter the pasta.  The Amma's Cheese Ravioli is filled with creamy ricotta, mozzarella, romano and Parmesan cheeses and topped with a savory marinara soft.  The pillows of ravioli is soft and moist and very light, in spite of the many cheeses.  It is a very basic dish, but a solid one.  Maybe my favorite dish here, the Papparadelle with Oxtail & Kobe beef ragu is like your Italian grandmother's version of pot roast.  It is hearty, with a beef stock based sauce, filled with slow cooked, tender beef and small cubed carrots.  The papparadelle is handmade, too!  It is comforting and rustic and reminds me of Autumn.  I've ordered this twice now.  DESSERTS  The desserts are not the highlight of this restaurant, admittedly.  We've tried quite a few and while we were happy enough, they weren't exceptional enough to revisit the next few visits.  The Ciabatta Bread Pudding is topped with a generous scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream, that melts over your warm pudding to create a richly sweet sauce that mingles with the caramel goodness leaking out of your pudding.  It was yummy, and a good version of the dessert.",

I came here with my fiance and his mom and we all loved it.   Coming on a Saturday night we surprisingly didn't have to wait to be seated. We were sat at a table in thier covered outdoor area, which was nice and not hot like you would expect in July in Charlotte.   First, they brought out bread, which I could have easily eaten 3 baskets of on my own if I weren't trying to save room for dinner. For dinner I ordered the pasta primevera with cream sauce and it was delicious. The serving was huge, I ended up bringing half of it home. My fiance ordered chicken parm, which may have been the biggest serving of chicken parm I've ever seen. It was cooked really well and wasn't overly breaded or dry. His mom ordered a pasta with chicken. Both were really really good! Unfortunately, none of us had room for dessert. They all looked amazing. Next time I may come just to try their dessert!   Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful in answering any questions we had about the menu.   I love it here! I'll definiely come back and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for good food and friendly service.",

Theirs a soup of the day I ordered the goat cheese Marscapone dip, the spaghetti and meatballs which was tender meatballs served with angel hair. The sauce tasted sweet and had fresh herbs. For dessert I had the cannoli it was a ricotta filling. The server was on point helpful on suggestions and not pushy.",

We ordered the penne vodka with chicken, which was creamy and tasty, along with a 9 inch white pizza pie, which was a perfect complement with fresh tasting ricotta cheese. The pasta is solid but definitely doesn't have that \"fresh handmade pasta\" taste that other higher end Italian spots in charlotte have (which is just fine given what Mama's is aiming to be)  While this doesn't make for a fancy meal out, it's a home run on what it's trying to be as a casual and cozy family Italian dinner spot. It's a great place to take grandparents or kids.",

Parking is also easy as the restaurant is located in a small strip of stores and restaurants near uptown with a good and free public parking lot. The interior is nice and they also have an enclosed outside area (which is great during the colder months also). I recently went with a large group to celebrate a birthday. When we arrived our table was ready and we were promptly seated. We started by ordering appetizers and drinks then onto entrees. I got the Pollo Alla Griglia which comes with a grilled chicken breast marinated in lemon and garlic, topped with bruschetta tomatoes served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and today's fresh vegetable. I'm trying to reduce my carb intake so I asked the server if I could substitute something for the potatoes and was given several great options. In summary everyone, all 10+ in the group loved the food and serve - highly recommend!!",

Before you even get inside, you can tell how good it is. A mass of people all coming and going with happy smiles on their faces. A full parking lot. People waiting.  Inside, the bar was quite small and cozy, but with an open walk up area to order a drink while waiting. The beer was perfectly chilled. Watching the food coming out of the kitchen,- I wanted one of every dish I saw. And everything smelled great!  For dinner, I chose the chicken Parmesan, and I was not disappointed. Everything was excellent! Service was great too! All of the prices were very reasonable.  I WILL be back!",

Today was my daughter's first recital and I wanted a good place to have a big family dinner after. Initially I though maggianos and then thought to myself, no, this is a challenge for Mama Ricotta's. No one was disappointed. The service was great and everyone complimented our daughter in her recital dress. No one had a bad thing to say about their meal. I ordered the penne a la vodka and swapped the penne for linguine. I ordered my daughter the spaghetti and meatballs and I promise, you only need to order one meatball, they are huge!!!

The carbonara was absolutely horrible it did not have a bacon taste at all. It taste like they threw some old soggy bacon on top of the noodles and mixed it in. It was not worth the $23.00 spent. I'm bad at cooking (hence why I purchased instead of making it) but my attempts at Carbonara taste much better! Theirs tasted like a cheap version with a regular Alfredo sauce instead of home made 3 cheese, egg, white wine sauce with the bacon cook well and simmered enough to creat a strong bacon flavor. I'm really disappointed about my experience and won't be returning. Cost too much to taste so cheap. Vapianos would be a better choose and cost less. Still looking for other great Italian inspired restaurants.",

The chopped salad was full of vegetables and the dressing (the house vinaigrette) was fantastic.  The pizza was one of the best - perhaps the best - I have had in Charlotte.  I haven't found a Charlotte pizza place that I love (being from Chicago I am a total pizza snob), but I thoroughly enjoyed the Joe's special at Mama Ricotta's.  The bread and olive oil that they place on the table at the start of the meal are also really tasty...  The service was great.  Our server was attentive, and she was wonderful about getting us samples of a couple of types of wine.  It helped us to select a bottle that we ended up really enjoying.    If I had a complaint, then it would only be about the cost of the wine.  The wine list is pricey, and that stood in sharp contrast to the prices of the entrees and appetizers - which I found to be very reasonable.    All in all, this is a great find.  I would definitely recommend Mama Ricotta's if you are in the mood for good Italian food at reasonable prices.",

Though I have tried some others like the Pasta Fra Diavolo which was good.  The boyfriend loves the calzones. Which is totally random - but whatever, it lets me get to go to Mama's!

I ordered the Cannolicchi Pesto di Pomodoro Secco with chicken, which was heavenly. My boyfriend got the Tomato Basil Angel Hair Pasta.  He got it with the optional meatballs -- that made the meal awesome!  We also had the peanut butter pie for dessert.  We weren't able to eat very much of it, since the entree portion sizes were pretty generous, but worth it for sure!  Overall, a great little pasta place!",

She informed us it was 1/2 off bottle of wine and made a great suggestion for my sister and I - a delicious Italian Pinot Noir.  My husband is not a wine drinker at all but with her info, he ordered a glass of moscato. He enjoyed it so much, he plans on purchasing it for home. We shared a caprese salad and for dinner we ordered two penne a la vodka with shrimp, fettuccine carbonara with shrimp,  and rigatoni with an extra dollop of ricotta. Everything was finger-licking good. The manager thought we had waited a bit long for our entrees so he came to the table and sent us two desserts.  It was completely unexpected but it shows how they value their customers.  I believe Hayley's attention to detail and personal interest made the entire evening a great experience.  She should be recognized by the managers and her co-workers.",

I'm not the richest of people and I always find something affordable and yummy here.  I love their garlic rolls, their lasagna and their desserts are some of the best in town (big portions, too - good to split with a friend or on a date).  I always leave the place with leftovers... I like a place that can feed me twice.    My only beef with them is that they took my FAVORITE pizza - the Balsamic glazed pork bbq pizza - off the menu.  Why!!!  Sometimes it can get a little crowded and quite loud, but the service is always nice and prompt and the food more than makes up for it.",

    "text": "When you think of a nice Italian restaurant, you don't think it would come in a strip mall, but Mama Ricotta's bucks the trend. Not only does the atmosphere & decor give the impression of a nicer Italian place, the food is pretty good.  While you may be thinking that this is a dinner only place, this is actually a really popular lunch place. There is usually a line during lunch, but it moves pretty quickly, especially if the outside seating is open. While the food can be a tad on the pricey side, I have yet to have a meal I haven't been happy with. They have plenty of selections for all Italian lovers so don't expect just the obvious options.   I'd suggest this place as more of a dinner place, mainly because of the prices along with the portion sizes. If you lunch it here, it may be a long afternoon at work trying to stay awake. And with their wine selection, making this a date destination isn't a bad idea either.",

The restaurant itself isn't very large, which can make for some crowded times during dinner and, somewhat surprisingly, lunch.  The food is outstanding however. The pasta is homemade, and the garlic knots are a must. I am a big fan of the angel hair and the lasagna.  Some dishes may be a bit pricey, but at least you are getting quality for your money.   If you are an Italian fan and a bit tired of the chain restaurants such as Olive Garden and Carabba's, you should take a chance and check out Mama's.",

Mama Ricotta's is great, some of the better Italian food in Charlotte, as far as I'm concerned. It's a really popular place (if you can't get a table, try the Ethiopian place in the same complex--great food, never packed, yummmmy), so try to make reservations or show up either earlier or later in the night. Once you're at your table, though, everything's all right.   Great beers and wines available, so you're always able to get well-lubricated over the course of a loud, heaping Italian meal. And the meals are ALWAYS huge. Their pastas are great--that's what most people order, as far as I can tell--as are their typical Italian restaurant salads and appetizers. You can get everything served Family Style if you like, which makes for portions that you won't believe. Great value, especially if you don't mind taking home large amounts of food to nibble on for the rest of the weekend. I love their Chicken (forget what it's called, but it's grilled with lemon), and I got like three breasts of it last time I was there, which is  nuts.   If you love Italian, and love eating lots and lots, check it out.",

The restaurant was quite busy on New Year's Eve; however, hostess and wait staff was accommodating and attentive.    A special holiday menu was provided, and I dined on Agnello Farcito - leg of lamb stuffed with Romano cheese and fresh parsley, gently braised in rich tomato sauce with olive oil mashed potatoes and braised black kale.  The lamb was very tender, sliced from the bone, rolled, and stuffed... what's not to like with that presentation?  I substituted Fontina risotto for the olive oil mashed potatoes... perfectly cooked, creamy, and just-enough cheesy.  And, I also opted for the asparagus over the braised black kale... wise choice on my part!  Portion was decent and filling enough that I took one of the lamb rolls home in order to save room for dessert!  And, while I had heard tall mouthwatering tales of their bread pudding, I ordered the Oreo Pie instead since it was only available that night for the special menu, and since plans of a return visit during 2011 were already dancing in my head!  Please believe this decadence was some kind of wonderful!!! The pastry chef should make it into heaven based on this creation alone... thick Oreo cookie crumb layer topped with cheesecake layer, chocolate ganache, sponge cake layer, more ganache, and caramel.  Oh baby, it was saying, \"Come to mama,\" with each layer of scrumptious decadence, and I went willingly with full abandon!!!    Absolutely a great dining experience!   I will be back soon to partake of the regular menu, that's not-so-regular, and won't think of leaving without having the bread pudding next time!",

To start, we had the tomato and mozzarella appetizer.  WOW!  Simple dish but absolutely amazing.  Not sure what made it taste so fantastic but it might have been the olive oil that it was sitting in.  Then, my mom and I split the family style dish \"Pollo Bianco\".  Again, this meal was very good.  5 chicken breasts smothered in a delicious sauce and mushrooms.  We got the garlic mashed potatoes as a side.  Yum!  I, also, ordered Mama's Mojito which is a bit pricey but delicious, nonetheless.  I would definitely go back.  And since they serve family style, I think this place would be great for big groups.

    "text": "Let me start out by saying: I love Mama Ricotta's food. I've had several great experiences both in the restaurant and with their catering. That being said, last night's performance -aside from the scrumptious food- was not acceptable.  I went with a group of ~15 people to Mama Ricotta's for a Christmas function. I was one of the people that voted to have the event at the restaurant because I've had such great experiences in the past. I know a larger party requires patience on both ends and that mistakes are inevitable, but we had quite a few... our drink orders were mixed up repeatedly. One person ordered a salad with romaine lettuce and it came out with iceburg. The servers kept placing the wrong meals with the wrong individuals, which I know is hard not to do with a big group -but it added to our frustration. We did all get our food, but none of the dishes came out at the same time, so several people's food was cold by the time the final entree came out.   The real fun started with the checks. Given the issues we had getting the right entree/drink to the right person, we knew the bills were going to be a nightmare -and they were. It took nearly 45 minutes to get our bills straightened out. By the time I actually received my bill (which was about 10 minutes after everyone else had paid and was leaving the restaurant) it was incorrect. I notified the server that my glass of Pinot Grigio was not on the ticket, he asked if that was a red wine. I know you only have to be 18 to serve alcohol, but it's important for servers to know which wines are white and which are red for customer service purposes. The server tried again with the ticket, which I had to go to the hostess stand to get, and it still did not have a glass of wine on it. Because I needed to leave I spoke to the manager, who was very nice and told me just to pay for my entree... but he kind of made me feel like I was making a stink to get my wine comped -which was not the case.  Will I try Mama Ricotta's again? Yes, but never again will I go back with a large group & I'll make sure not to order wine next time.",

I had a chicken dish with polenta, which wasn't anything special, but it wasn't bad.  I would, however, steer clear of their pizza dish of the night, which was truffle oil, pancetta, wild mushrooms and fingerling potatoes.  I think it might have something to do with seeing it reconstituted by a friend later that evening.    Good service, and good, if not memorable, food.",

Perhaps I'm used to the old Mama Ricotta's that was much more subdued and intimate, but the noise level in here made holding a dinner conversation very difficult.  That said, the garlic knots are sinfully delicious, the tomato with mozzarella is stellar and the wine list is expansive enough.  We get the penne with chicken and broccoli every time (YUM) and like the standard angel hair pasta as well.  Very excited to come back and try their gluten-free menu next time I'm in town.",

The atmosphere is very relaxing and comfortable. I am a fan of dim lighting, it's very calming and soothing. We are immediately greeted by our server who wasted no time with the drink and food specials of the evening.  I opted on the alcohol because I was still feeling nauseous from the 6 hour flight. We decided on sharing a large pepperoni and sausage pizza with a family style portion  of their Rigatoni with this sausage meat sauce.   Service was great, the refills and warm herb bread with a spicy chili oil kept coming. I was stuffed but satisfied. Not bad for my first Italian meal in North Carolina.",

I ordered a full mama's salad and added chicken for an up charge. It looked like half the amount of chicken as usual half of which was gristle and/or skin. 2 I added extra olive and artichoke hearts which was another up charge (which they didn't tell me it would cost extra) but there weren't extra of either. 3 I got extra dressings and were charged for those as well and they weren't even correct. For the price point of this restaurant I'd expect them to get orders correct and to tell me if something I ordered had an extra charge. Just really disappointed in what used to be one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants",

    "text": "Following a busy Sunday, I was having a serious craving for pasta. Living gluten free, I don't often get the chance to enjoy pasta in restaurants. There's no notation on the menu or on the website, but after catching a Yelp review mentioning a gluten free offering, we took the chance and headed to Mama Ricotta's.  On a Sunday evening, dining on a whim, we were pleased to be seated immediately even though we didn't have a reservation. We were placed in the back corner of the restaurant, which offered a decent vantage point for people watching and peeking at dishes coming out of the kitchen.  Our server came and shared with me that most of the pasta dishes can be made gluten free by substituting a GF penne. I hemmed and hawed and ended up choosing the Carbonara. My date ordered a salad to start, and it arrived within minutes of placing our order. The pacing was strange, though -- he got his salad, bread for the table was delivered, and our entrees came within five minutes of one another. Generally, I'm pumped about speedy service, but it created an awkward timeline of our meal -- potentially because we were dining 20 minutes before closing time.  My meal was placed in front of me in a large, black ceramic bowl. Three greasy fingerprints reflected the light on the rim of my bowl, and a long streak followed around the edge from where someone in the kitchen had attempted to wipe my plate before service. On a white plate, this may not have been so glaring, but it definitely caught my attention. The kitchen needs more clean linens, apparently.  My pasta was delightful. The flavor was perfect and it was delivered at just the right temperature. I was pleased with the portion size and with the generosity of the gentleman grating fresh parmesan over my noodles. I also sampled my date's short rib, and it was quite good.  If I wasn't so happy with the flavor, price and portion size of my gluten free pasta, the frantic service and streaky plate would have turned me off entirely. I'll give Mama Ricotta's another try when it's not so close to closing time, and hopefully they'll earn more stars from me.",

I'm happy to report that this place didn't disappoint! I'd made reservations online and they called to confirm my reservations early that afternoon. When we arrived our table was ready with no wait!   Our waiter was kind enough to go over all the specials and give us time to look over the menu. For such a large party, I was glad to see that our glasses were never empty and all our orders were right when they hit the table.   I ordered the lasagna. It's not your typical lasagna, they call it \"southern Italian style\" and it's a mix of beef, veal and homemade sausage with a cheese blend on a bed of sauce. It was very meaty and cheesy as it should be with a classic sauce. I enjoyed every bite. Add to that those freaking addicting garlic roll (perfect for dipping) and I'd absolutely order it again.   There were a lot of other dishes on our table that looked amazing so I'm definitely coming back for more goodies...and some dessert!",

So of course we did :-)   The front/side of the restaurant is under construction, but once I enter the restaurant, I forgot all about it. They weren't loud and distracting which is a huge plus. The restaurant is dimly lit and has a romantic ambience, even during lunch.   First, we had Italian bread brought out to us with a seasoned oil. The bread was light, fluffy, and didn't even need to be dipped in the oil (but of course it was great with it too!)  For an appetizer, we got the eggplant fries. They were heavily fried and extra delicious. The crunch was phenomenal. I haven't had eggplant prepared quite that way before, and it was a surprising treat.   Next, we shared a chicken sausage (yes they have that!), red onion and spinach pizza with extra sauce (we made our own). The crust has such a satisfying crunch. I usually do not eat all of the crust off of pizza, let me tell you, there was no crust left from my slices! (I didn't even notice until my wife pointed it out!) The chicken sausage was cooked perfectly, and the onions and spinach played a perfect compliment to the sausage.   The service all around was great and I will definitely go back again. Go Mama Ricotta's!",

She was able to explain the menu while steering us to specific dishes based off what we told her we liked. She was quick and attentive - the staff continued to pour our wine glasses full for us and the manager came by to ask how everything was going - perfect service!  The food was unbelievable! I've had pasta before, but not like this - everything was superb!! My only regret is we had no room for dessert after this meal.  The best tip about this place: I signed up for their eNewsletter online and in the first email had a free appetizer coupon to use!",

The chicken used in the cheese Ken Romano is superior quality, so tender, full of flavor, juicy.  The tiramisu came highly recommended and it did not disappoint!!!  You MUST save room for this dessert.  Fabulous Italian restaurant in midtown.",

I think other people have the same idea because there were a lot of business-dressed patrons filling every seat.  If you plan on talking to secure that business deal, sit outside (as long as the weather is accommodating). It's rather loud and difficult to hear your party indoors and I found myself smiling and nodding across the way without really knowing what my colleague was saying half the time (shhh, don't tell).  The food was good...not spectacular. The salmon that comes on the salad is of large proportion. The sandwiches actually looked the best out of all the dishes at our table! I had the capellini pomodoro with the tomato basil sauce...okay. The rolls were rolls...not french bread, but were good.   I'll give it another try because other Yelpers have had such a good experience here...and perhaps I'll order one of their sandwiches.",

Mama ricotta's is a 1/2 step above olive garden, now ive never eaten at an oliver garden but thats what i imagine. its pretty standard mediocre italian food that emphasizes alot of heavy cream to create flavorful dishes, which is just so not italian.   Not that there is anything wrong with mediocre italian food, it fills you up, but 4 stars is crazy. Both times ive had the penne alla vodka, once again its pretty mediocre.   Fried calamari was fried calamari, it did not kill me, but i laughed when they served it with hellmans chipotle mayo as the side (hello cocktail sauce? maybe a tomato sauce?).   I will say its rather inexpensive so compared to a luce or vivace i can see this being a fan fav.",

Last night we went there for a birthday dinner...mistake 1st thing they put the 7 of us in a small table for 6 max...how to you have any room for the food? DUH (plus the place was not even busy) They did accommodate us after my request to put 2 tables together. We ordered a few appetizers to start...one of them being the mozzarella and tomatoes, we ordered the big portion and asked for the red peppers addition as usual. The order came to the table with 3 small slices of mozzarella and banana peppers. I again had to request a correction. I don't mind paying restaurant markups...but come on a few tomatoes and the paltry amount of cheese for like 9 bucks...shame on you. When the entrees came the runner looks at us like make room. Of course the table was full because the the app and salad courses had not been cleared. Going to a restaurant should not be about correcting step by step...it should be about having relaxing and fun time. There are many good choices in Charlotte, unfortunately Mama Ricottas looks like it may no longer be one of them.",

The first time was Restaurant Week so I understood they were busy and there were no tables available...no problem.  Saturday solidified  the fact that I will never attempt to go there again.  We were searching for a dinner spot and decided we wanted Italian.  We are aware it's usually packed so  we called first to assess the wait.  We were told by the person on the phone that there was no wait so we headed right over.  We arrived 10 minutes afterwards and there was suddenly nothing available nor did the hostess offer to take our names just in case something came up.  She kept telling us we could sit at the bar. When we explained we just called the hostess began to tell me about other patrons that had reservations, which had nothing to do with the fact that I'd just called and confirmed availability.  Ultimately there was no sense of customer service and I was very disappointed with her tone and the way she handled our visit.  To avoid ruining a perfectly good day we left and found a location that could offer the level of service we deserved.",

The calamari is decent but the goat cheese app is something I frequently dream of!! It is amazing. It has marinara and toasted bread points for dipping. I have had the spaghetti with meat sauce and the ravioli with meat sauce. The angel hair is made in house daily and just to die for. The ravioli is cheese filled and the meat sauce is a lovely combo of meat and chunky tomatoes.   The food is awesome and the service is good as well. I noticed they have a pizza oven as a center piece so I would love to try their pizza next time. But overall a great find for a really decent price. They also have family style dishes which is one of my favorite things ever so I plan on trying that very soon as well. A def must try at least once!",

    "text": "We came here to celebrate my college graduation. I looked at TripAdvisor for a Italian restaurant good for kids and for special celebrations. That lead me to Mama's. However..... obviously people reviewing here and giving 5 stars don't know about Italian culinary. The restaurant menu includes a briefing about the owner's family and history. They can indeed be Italians but they have managed to create a menu based upon what us Americans think about Italian food (pasta sauces and breads with loads of garlic on it and lasagna with ricotta cheese on it). Just take as an example Olive Garden.... and I am not comparing Mama's to Olive Garden as the food here is much better, but in terms of laying down the american vision and taste for Italian food.  If there is an authentic Italian restaurant in Charlotte that is the Luce Ristorante in Uptown and also Dolce Ristorante.   This restaurant has a decent quality of food, the service is great, but quite honestly, I have tasted better pasta than this one at Hawthorne Pizza Bar in Huntersville.  The Nutella pie that everyone claims to be \"delicious\" does not taste like Nutella at all. It tastes like Peanut Butter cheese cake. I even asked the server if she had made a mistake and brought the wrong dessert and she said that it was the correct one. We then said: It tastes like Peanut Butter and she replied: Really? But doesn't Nutella tastes like Peanut Butter to you??? That response made me think that clearly that the restaurant may not even know what they are cooking.",

Now we go every time we make the trip to Charlotte (an hour) for camera gear. He has taken a couple of friends as well.    My son could eat the bread and flavored oil all day. It is really good. The pizza which is what we always get is terrific too. So, I can't speak to the other dishes, but they look great. I want to try some of those soon.   Every server we've had has been terrific both inside and on the patio. They have a cover on the patio and a fireplace going when it's cold. That's where we ate last time and really enjoyed the outdoor feel.",

From the moment we walked in, the staff was pretty friendly and accommodating. We got the Burrata & Prosciutto appetizer, it was lovely. Our entrees were Penne Alla Vodka and Rigatoni with Meat Sauce. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful; just like Italian food should be.   We noticed that the dessert portions were enormous so we asked if we could be served just half of a tiramisu. Our waitress was absolutely accommodating and she made it happen. We weren't expecting to pay half price for the dessert we just didn't want the rest to go to waste, but she did charge us half price. I wish this place was in DC, we would be here all the time.",

I'm giving it 2 stars not because of the food, the food was amazing - rather, it was the way we were treated by the staff. Our server was impatient, hurried us along in our orders, and really just seemed to be bothered by the fact that we were there at all. When asked if we needed more time and we responded with \"yes,\" they were visibly annoyed by our request for a few more moments. Twice, the servers also sat the plates down in front of the wrong people (definitely not a big deal, it happens). It was just the reaction when we started rearranging plates that was surprising - they treated us as if we were wrong, as if we hadn't known what we ordered.   Upon walking in, the hostess seemed to be inconvenienced by the fact we had no reservation. Rather than adopting an accommodating attitude, she really tried to undersell the section we were seated in. Numerous times, we all felt very rushed during our time there as she was constantly peeking around the corner, very obviously checking to see how close we were to finishing our meals.  Long story short, not impressed by the staff. Luckily, the food is so good I'm sure I'll probably return - but, next time, just for takeout.",

I went with the Tonarelli Carbonara which was excellent! It doesn't seem like sufficient pasta but it's enough, believe me.   We also ordered the Tonarelli Pesto Shrimp which was also excellent! You can tell they really know what they're doing in the kitchen.   For dessert we enjoyed possibly the best bread pudding we've ever had! No,  I'm serious!

The first server who was with us seemed to be off--as in I sort of got the vibe that he didn't want to serve us. We knew what we wanted and after telling him he stated he didn't have his notepad and pen to write it down and that he would be back. He didn't come back and we were given another server, Anthony. Anthony brought us our drinks and fresh bread. He was such a great server and really compensated for the weird interaction with the previous server. Anthony was very attentive throughout the whole time we were there and would be one of the reasons we would return!   We started off with the calamari. The calamari was DELICIOUS. It was plated beautifully and for an appetizer the portion is well worth your money. The calamari was well fried and I personally enjoyed dipping it into the marinara sauce that was also came with the dish. For our meals I got the angel hair pasta with the tomato basil sauce and chicken and my friend got the ravioli. For my pasta, the amount of chicken was a generous amount and made well. The pasta was cooked to perfection and overall tasted really good. I would definitely recommend this dish.  For our lunch ended up being around $30 which is not bad for the amount of food we got. As for parking-- there is a lot of space behind the restaurant if the spaces upfront are full.",

We decided to have an early dinner before they were overwhelmed with Restaurant Week diners during their normal dinner hours.   At 5:30p, we were seated in a booth right away and our server filled our water glasses and brought out those meh tasting garlic buns (might want to season the oil dip)...The server was very attentive throughout the meal and filled our water glasses more than a couple of times despite the incoming dinner crowd. This was kinda of an odd meal for me and I couldn't evaluate it as much as I would have liked because I got my first medical school acceptance phone call before the first course came out and I was a little dazed (but yay!) sorry not as many pics this time!   Appetizer:  Tomato Soup: nothing special at all..very rustic style tomato soup. This comes in a very small cup and I never received the crostini that was supposed to come with it.  Arancini: the bf liked it but, I thought it needed more seasoning. Good sized portion though.   Second Course:  Penne alla Vodka: definitely not as good as the regular penne alla vodka quality. The sauce was a little soupy and a tiny bit bland.   Entree:  Tomato and Shrimp Risotto: very al dente, almost undercooked. The shrimp was cooked and seasoned perfectly though. The bf didn't really like the fishy taste from the risotto, I'm guessing they used seafood stock for this. I didn't mind it as much.   Dessert:  Lemon Blueberry Tiramisu: I was hesitant to try it but, it was actually really good. Very refreshing with its take on fruit.  Nutella Cannoli: Very good! The filling was delicious, the perfect combination of crunchy and sweet.   It was an ok Queen's Week Meal. I wouldn't really get anything again besides the desserts and the penne alla vodka.",

From all the cars in the lot, one might expect an hour or more wait time, but they say our table of four in 15 minutes. Bread and drinks were on the table in less than 10 and Tangie our server was attentive but not overbearing. Giorgio (forgive me if I got that wrong) was kind and pleasant as was the manager whose name I failed to get. I am a fan of the calamari, sangria, and pollo carciofi. That is my regular order, but last visit I decided to try something different. The polenta was so creamy and cheesy, the chicken thighs tender and juicy. I tasted a meatball off my besties plate and it was also good. The pollo carciofi is still my favorite, though. I also ordered the tiramisu since it was a special night. Yum! So good!",

    "text": "We were looking for a casual, family friendly Italian spot for dinner and chose this place after reading the reviews. We were not disappointed. Very nice decor - the wood fired pizza oven between the bar and the dining room is a nice, rustic touch.   Hubby and I really enjoyed the herbed rolls and olive oil that comes complimentary - the kid not so much, so we ordered garlic cheese bread. Since the kid wanted to skip the cheese, they added extra slices of the bread. That was much appreciated. The rooms and the bread were flavorful, soft and warm.  I started with the caprese (mozzarella & tomato appetizer on the menu), as that is always my measure of an Italian place. The tomatoes were ripe and the mozzarella very flavorful. I did have to add balsamic, as it only comes dressed with olive oil.   The kid chose spaghetti with meat sauce (and a meatball). He liked the meatball a lot, though he complained the meat sauce was \"spicy.\"  The meat in the sauce did have a kick, so heads up if you have a kid in your party that's weird about stuff like that.   Hubby had rigatoni with a bolognese sauce (he added ricotta) that he enjoyed. The meat in the bolognese had the same spice kick, but Hubby is a grown up and loved it. I ordered the cheese ravioli with a butter and sage sauce (you get a choice of sauces). It was amazing!  The butter sauce was a thin cream type sauce. I expected the sage to be fried crispy, but it was not. No matter, it was a terrific dish.   Definitely a good place to enjoy a good Italian meal with the family. I wouldn't suggest it as a romantic date night spot though, it's much too loud on a busy night.",

The buffet was $35 per person!! We were so blessed to have the cook make us lasagna for only $11.50 a plate. We chose to have 3 of our family members (including me) to eat at the buffet and the rest to eat lasagna. The buffet included salads, pastas, ravioli, chicken, salmon, bread, shrimp, brunch items, and of course dessert. The penne a la vodka was very good as was the baked ziti. I didn't really like the ravioli but my family did a lot. The dessert were so delicious and petite, they had 3 mousse varieties, cream puffs, eclairs, chocolate chip cookies, sprinkle cookies, and banana muffins. The lemon mousse was my personal favorite as well as the cream puffs. My family really did enjoy the desserts! As for the lasagna, it wasn't really a showstopper for us. My mom said it tasted pretty weird, but that's ok. Our server Anthony was so nice and on top of the game, we really appreciated his service.  Even though my family had a good time, we won't be back just because of personal preferences.",

I suggest not getting an appetizer if you're looking to finish your meal. It's still a big dish for one person. They bring out Fresh bread and oil before dinner, so that can be your appetizer. For dinner, I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka with chicken to give it some extra protein. For a red sauce it was actually very light. I also got their sangria which was delicious and highly suggest if you are looking for something light and fruity. The service was great and it didn't take long for our food to come out for 4 people. This is also a great place for a date or if you are looking for catering, they do that too!",

Overall great wine list with lots of options. The restaurant week menu was very VERY good. I have dietary restrictions (no pork/red meat). Usually during restaurant week, people don't accommodate requests. However, Mama Ricotta's made that exception and prepared each dish without meat for me.  Everything I ate ended up with a plate licked clean. So good.",

    "text": "We were referred to this Italian restaurant,  given great reviews, but unfortunately the food was far from great.   Began with the mozzarella & tomato appetizer,  large portion,  but for whatever reason was doused with salt. Why add, let alone, pour salt on mozzarella which is already salty & tomatoes that are naturally high in sugar? The natural flavors of this appetizer were ruined.  The tomatoes were ripe & generous with the portions we received. Taking a bite of this dish only to get a mouth full of salt ruined the presentation, taste & enjoyment.   *Note to staff/owner(s): salt, etc can always be added to a dish.  For those who need &/or want to eat healthy this is not the choice for you.   For my main meal I chose the chicken parmigiana,  this was one dish that didn't include a heavy  sauce, thought I couldn't go wrong. Well I was wrong,  three large portions of chicken, breaded with mozzarella & spaghetti on the side.  For some reason the chicken could be cut with a spoon.  It tasted as if it was marinated in butter...I have never had chicken parmigiana that  lost all of it's True taste & again they must have topped the dish off with salt. $20 for a dinner that made me sick, terrible headache, from the sodium overload & whatever they cooked the chicken in.  While the waitress was very nice & polite she was stressed which caused her major confusion.  If you're looking for a healthy True Italian meal this restaurant is not it unfortunately.",

I am a huge Joe Scibelli fan and I couldn't believe it took me so long to make a visit to his crowning jewel- where it all began, Mama Ricotta's. Incidentally, we went during restaurant week. It was definitely busy but thanks to Open Table we were able to secure a table with a reservation. Once seated, we poured over the menu and decided to go family style instead of restaurant week prixe fixe menu. You start out with fresh baked rolls and olive oil dipping sauce. I doubt you could go wrong with any wines on the menu. We ordered the family style mamas salad with Gorgonzola and sun dried tomato dressing. We didn't realize the Gorgonzola was not actual dressing but simply Gorgonzola cheese, but both together were quite delicious. Pro tip- you can order bottles of the salad dressing to take it home! We also ordered the penne alla vodka and Pollo Ramono. pro tip- the pollo Romano does not come with pasta in family style. However the manager was quick to fix the problem when we didn't realize this and questioned it later and kindly brought us out some spaghetti. Overall? The service is great and the food is amazing. I am dying to try the pizza next!",

So, when I found myself in the area around lunch-time today I decided to stop in and see what's on the menu these days.  For lunch, they have several sandwich options as well as yummy looking pizza selections. However, I haven't had pasta in a while, so I decided to go for that instead.  I was sort of in the mood for a red sauce, but as I perused the menu, nothing in that category jumped out at me. Instead, the chicken & broccoli penne pasta was calling my name.   So, I went with it and sure am glad that I did.  The sauce was somewhat creamy - but not too heavy.  It had a lot of garlic (yum) and a nice lemony flavor.  I enjoyed it very much.   At lunch, this entree was $8 and I had enough to take some home for later.   Since I was by myself, I just sat at the bar.  The guy behind the bar was a bit busy since he was taking care of all the take-out orders.  The service was a bit \"meh\" but that's what I get for sitting at the bar. Next time, I would skip the bar area and just get a table instead.",

I had the shrimp scampi and my husband had chicken parm which was also excellent. Our kids had penne alla vodka which they loved!! The food and hostess were a 5, but our server brought our experience down a notch. We did not have reservations and it was packed so we opted to sit in the cocktail lounge. The server there was very slow, inattentive and overall not good. He didn't listen well and we had to repeatedly ask for refills and ice. He never checked on us. He just didn't seem committed. Other than that everything else was excellent.",

Our waiter offered to have the chef skip the black pepper or scale it back. I chose to scale it back and it was the perfect choice. It still had a kick but not too much for me. My Dad also had the same meal and enjoyed it. Also per the waiter's recommendation, my husband had the Chicken Parmesan, which is his favorite.

We were constrained by time and didn't want to leave a pizza in the car for several hours. She had manager comp us a free dessert which we were going to get anyway. I know this restaurant has been a mainstay for Charlotte residents and visitors for years and have frequented it myself many times over the years. This anomaly of burned pizza was a shock because I expect more from a restaurant of your reputation. Surely quality should be a given.

    "text": "I absolutely hate to write negative reviews, but in this case, it's unfortunately unavoidable.  I honestly have no idea how this restaurant has the rating that it does, because it is an extremely poor example of what Italian food is.  The best way for me to sum up the food here is: One step below Olive Garden and Ragazzis.  The food is watered-down and bland, Americanized 'fake Italian' dishes that cater to those patrons with unsophisticated palates who don't know the difference.   I ordered the Pasta Carbonara when we are here, and I have no idea how they classify what was placed in front of me as 'Carbonara'.... It was basically a fake from-the-jar Alfredo sauce on top of undercooked vermicelli with some frozen peas and bacon thrown in.  In order to be Carbonara, the dish must have a sauce comprised mostly of whisked eggs, pasta water, Parmesan, and seasoning.  Calling what was served \"Carbonara\" is just wrong, and is an unfair representation of Italian food.  The wine was actually fairly good (I think we ordered a Pinot and a Riesling), and our waitress was very kind.  She was so nice that I felt bad about hardly touching my food, and didn't want to tell her how bad we all thought our meals were. It really wasn't her fault that the food was awful!  There are several other Italian cuisine restaurants in the area that are actually real Italian, and are far better than Mama Ricottas (for ex: Vivace, Fiamma).  If you enjoy real Italian food and/or are a foodie, save yourself the time and money and search out another option.  Sadly, the only reason that I even gave this place 2 stars is because the service and the staff were pleasant and attentive.",

Don't be fooled with the strip shop location, this is a nice little place very close to downtown charlotte.  I had the chicken parm-- way to much for me to finish.  Which was a shame since I was not going to travel with my leftovers.  Wife got the oxtail ragu dish, she was not a big fan of.  Fatty beef, etc.  our two small kids are just fine with buttered spaghetti noodles and parm cheese.  Wait staff was very good.  Highly recommend this place if you're looking for some nice Italian.  Family friendly, but you can also do a date night here just as easy.",

Glad that we made a reservation as things were hopping on a Saturday night - had to push through several waiting parties to get in the door!  We had expected a bit more upscale decor, so we were both a bit overdressed - place is very casual and nothing special to look at.  We were both hungry and ordered quickly - I went for a glass of Malbec, house salad (which is a smaller portion of Mama's salad), and the pasta special, a sea bass served over linguine.  Girlfriend got a glass of Riesling, house salad, and clams over spaghetti.  We munched on the garlic rolls (served warm, with olive oil and red pepper, and you can get more if you ask the waiter nicely).  Food was good and hearty, and we both were full by the time the plates were taken away.  Flavor was typical of Ametican Italian - heavier sauces, lots of garlic - and pastas were nice and chewy (pasta is not made in house).  We got the tiramisu for dessert which was typical American- style tiramisu (large, lots of creme, not super flavorful on the coffee side).  Total came to ~$70 (before tip).  Would definitely go back (wanted to try the pizza), but this place is not quite up to your NYC / Boston North End Italian standard.",

I love them both but every once in a blue moon they can be a little off (dry, salty, etc) Carrot Cake Cheesecake (for dessert I usually share and pick a bite or two and am over it, that's just me though. For my few bites, I liked it. It could have been a little more room temp, felt like it was pre sliced and taken out the fridge to our table but overall it was good. I liked the combo and it was huge--a must share dish.   Love their sweet tea too!  Oh and the last time I went I had the BEST server. His name sounded like Lavender but I know it wasn't Lavender. He was friendly, patient and attentive--to the point that he was already filling my glass of sweet tea as soon as I finished my last sip.",

The decor in some aspects is cool but in others it could use some updating. You can tell they have probably made some changes over the years but not all the ones they need to. Our waitress was super sweet and friendly which was also another plus.  They bring bread and oil yo start when you sit down. The bread is actually rolls which I found disappointing, it's served with a slightly spicy oil. We had the goat cheese snd mascarpone dip with marinara and it was delicious. The goat cheese was present but not overwhelming. It comes with toast but I wish it had been served with something more bite size such as crostini etc. I should also mention that we came during lunch time and not dinner so we didn't have the whole menu to pick from. I had the angel hair pasta with tomato basil sauce and it was good, I was happy with it. My husband ordered the penne with vodka sauce and it was also delicious, it had some spice to it as well. I like spice but for some it may have been too much.  I would eat here again it would not go out of my way to do so.",

If overall fitness and money weren't an issue, you would probably find me eating here 6 out of the 7 nights a week. Love Italian!!!  The food is absolutely great. Each table receives free bread appetizers and are served with a very tasty EVOO. Ask for a little balsamic on the side and you can literally make a meal out of this in itself!   Additional appetizers and salads, such as the Fried Calamari & the Sicilian Roasted Pepper Salad, are also very, very good. For an entree, I had myself a basic vodka blush sauce over angel hair dish that was absolutely phenomenal.   The menu is pretty broad and you won't have a hard time finding something you like if your a picky eater. It is somewhat on the pricey side, but rarely will you be dissapointed with the meal in comparison to the cost.  Despite the location (nestled in a small shopping center), the overall layout is perfect for Italian atmosphere. The interior is dolled-up in a very elegant, but not over elegant way. The noise is adequate and seating can be a little tight at certain times, i.e. a Saturday night. The exterior & outdoor seating are decorated with lattice and vine, has good lighting, and is great weather permitting.  They have a full bar (inside) to accomodate your choice of drink, and offer different specials per day of the week.   Overall, this is my new favorite in Charlotte for dine-in Italian. A must!",

It's not really in my hood but decided I wanted some Rigatoni, Yelp'd it, and these guys came up. I've driven by it dozens of times and to be honest, thought it may be a sandwich/sub shop or some other take out type strip mall joint. DON\"T BE FOOLED by the unassuming street front. Go inside and check it out!! I literally stopped at the reception (yes, I was greeted and welcomed) and had to smile. While taking in the inviting, Italian Chalet ambience that looks like it should be situated on some Mediterranean bluff, I was directed over to the bar to pick up my take away order. The kind gent behind the bar, who was on the horn taking other orders, glanced over with a quick smile to let me know he knew I was there. This is something I always notice in a restaurant or anywhere customer service is important - does that staff look past you or do they make an effort for eye contact? Based on the time frame from order to when I actually arrived (10 min) he was able to guess who I was and promptly went to packaging my order. Needless to say I was already excited - it smelled like my Auntie Rita's (not really my aunt) kitchen on Sunday afternoon. An oversized handled bag (re-usable) was filled with what appeared to be my order plus maybe another 2 patrons orders. Everything was kept in a warmer cabinet (not under a heat lamp) until I arrived which was also housing baking sheets full of tear apart rolls...they'll change your life, for sure. I had a moment to look around their bar/lounge area which I will certainly be back to. I didn't see the wine list but it appears you'll most definitely be able to find something you like - I saw lots of good opened bottles meaning you can get it by the glass. There is a wood fired pizza oven as soon as you walk in and I saw a few being carried out by the staff that looked really nice. The bar keep thanked me, wished me Happy New Year and off I went. I ordered the Rigatoni with Meat Sauce and the Chopped Salad. Absolutely amazing! The pasta was cooked perfectly - great texture and flavor. The gravy was bright red and full of fresh tomato flavor. The meat was tender and possibly rough chopped meatballs. The wife thought there should be more gravy but I thought it was just perfect. The salad was certainly a masterpiece. Chopped is certainly the right name for this salad. Everything in it was chopped so that it blended all of the flavors of the salad in every bight.  Olives, Pepperoncini, Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, Nuts (Walnuts??), Lettuce, Kale, Carrot, Onion, Chick Pea.....all I can say is, Damn! Needless to say, I'll be back, lots - Can't wait to work my way through their menu.  Thanks, Mama!",

How could you not love it with Ricotta in the actual name! I first went on a date with a boyfriend and really enjoyed it. But it wasn't until, when I eventually tried the Goat Cheese and Marscapone dip months later, was it necessary that I return weekly to satisfy my craving. If you are a big fan of cheese or pizza (who isn't?) then you will LOVE this. It's like creamy little salty, sweet heaven on a crustini. Dang, now I'm hungry...   Moving on now... the service is always impeccable and the people are very friendly. I always spot the same two men observing and attending to the guests in the dining room. I could never figure out if these men are the managers or the actual owners, but I like that they are always visible.   I have frequented Mama Ricotta's on busy weekend nights but seem to never have to wait for a table. The prices are reasonable. I suspect you could dine there for 2 at about $50 to $70.   I highly recommend Mama Ricotta's if you live in the uptown or Dilworth area for awesome Italian but I also highly suggest fitting in lots of cardio the following day. ;)",
