    "text": "Been to Poppy's now several times. I a recent trip back to Charlotte, I made sure it was on my list for a breakfast stop before I left. It's busy most hours of the mornings on the weekends, but try to get there before 9am to avoid longer lines and the incoming church crowd from across the street. This will give you a better shot to sit outside.  Great for breakfast sandwiches, but also the homemade cream cheese is a winner. My fav is the jalapeno! Plenty of fruit and other breakfast items like quick omelets and lox. If bagel lunch is your thing, they've got deli sandwiches and sides ready for you.  Personal favorite is the bacon, egg & cheese on an everything bagel. Make sure to get the extra egg for 50 cents to balance out the bread.",

Sesame, plain, everything, and egg are all delicious.  Not only do they have excellent bagels, but they also have great homemade cream cheese. The chocolate chip cream cheese is delicious--I ate a quarter of a pound of it on matzos in one sitting. Probably not the greatest idea, but it was delicious.  The location is very good--the shopping centeris nice, and parking is plentiful. I wish it was a little bit closer to our house--I'd stop for an early morning bagel once in awhile.   Service is good--really no problems to complain about. They're always extremely busy, so if you're planning to eat there, you may not always get a table.",

I like to support small businesses and the guy I would've guessed was the owner, or at least the oldest employee I saw, was very nice. I'd recommend checking it out. :)",

Be prepared for a wait in the morning hours, but it was impressive to see how quickly the staff is able to move through orders. However, there were issues with my order that marred my experience. For some strange reason, when the employee called my name for me to grab my order, he realized that he had never prepared my order. Not sure what that was about. He quickly grabbed my two bagels and cream cheese to go, but neither were toasted (which I had asked) and one had the wrong flavor of cream cheese (plain, not the veggie that I had ordered). The bright point of the experience was the bagels themselves. I tried the asiago and grabbed a blueberry for my mister. Both were delicious! I would consider coming back despite my messed up order because they were that good. Also, it seems like they have daily specials listed up front. Be on the lookout for $4.99 bagel sandwich specials.",

Stopped by today when I was in the area again to get a cream cheese.  It was 3:03 (closing was 3:00) and they refused my purchase. Told them I just wanted one cream cheese and I'd  pay cash or credit, whichever was easier, they said, \"No, we are closed.\"  There were still customers inside.  I have been in the service industry for years and detest poor customer service, whether it's on the phone with AT&T or in a privately owned bagel shop.  I will probably not return and will certainly be sharing the negative experience I had today with the same friends and co-workers.  It's a shame that a local business can't look beyond a three minute time frame to see the bigger picture.",

Because of this I was challenged with finding an equivalent when I moved to Charlotte. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Poppy's Bagels nails it!  As mentioned in some other reviews here, Poppy's delivers when it comes to NY-style bagels and other deli delights. Something about a steaming hot bacon egg and cheese that does the body good. Not a breakfast fan? Not a problem. I've stopped into Poppy's at least on a couple of occasions for lunch and like any other superior NY/NY-style deli Boars Head meats are the upper echelon of cold cuts and helps Poppy's score big in my book.

I always love to get a toasted onion bagel (with the center of the dough scooped out to cut carbs of course!) with veggie cream cheese. My son and daughter both got their cinnamon raisin bagel, one with plain cream cheese and the other with raisin walnut cream cheese. My husband got a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel. We also ordered a blueberry muffin as it was taunting us as we were paying. Everything was delicious. Yummy freshly made cream cheese spreads. Lots of fresh and crunchy vegetables in my veggie one. My daughter loved the raisin walnut cream cheese as it was sweet and flavorful. The plain was fluffy and creamy. Definitely a great place to stop in for breakfast or lunch. The counter was full of different kinds of salads- pasta, egg, tuna, chicken, shrimp. They had all kinds of amazing looking items in their case. I know that we will going back very soon to try their shrimp salad and blueberry blintzes.",

Maybe it needed salt but was hoping for a good taste. The coffee is very good. However I can't give them 5 stars because of the taste. The service is good but it is conveyer belt style when you walk in. So if you're not ready, they can easily get the order of the person behind you....it happened. Yay. I might try it again though.",

    "text": "We ended up at Poppy's Bagels on a whim.... Passing through Elizabeth and hit up Yelp for a breakfast suggestion.  So many Yelpers had good opinions so we decided to see what it was all about.  There was a big line to greet us, but there were plenty of employees so the line was moving at a pretty good pace.  They had a good size breakfast and lunch menu including bagel sandwiches of all kinds (Boars Head for lunch meat).  They also had around 10 varieties of different cream cheeses for bagel toppings.  As far as bagel flavors there was probably around 15 different ones.  I choose everything with light veggie cream cheese, hubby got a sausage egg and cheese on multigrain.  The bagels are really big!  I grew up in NY with good bagels and these were close but more \"bready\" than a bagel from Brueggers just as a comparison.  Prices were moderate for bagels- my cream cheese was $2.79 and my husband's was $4.99.  Not cheap but they were a good size.  We may go back if in the area but I wouldn't say I'm in love.  What did look good was all of the lunch salad/side options.  They were rocking the deli choices for sure.  I may have to try lunch.",

The line was super long & the small dining area was spilling over with people but my sandwich still managed to come out quickly. I poured my hazelnut coffee w half & half & took my order to go. The coffee was great. The sandwich was decent. I ended up pulling the onion, salmon & tomato off and just marveling at how amazing the bagel was. A thin, nutty outer crust & a dense chewy inside. Heavenly. Next time I'll keep it simple. But those bagels are on my must have list now!",

There is hands down no better French Dip in Charlotte and I have eaten a few over the years. The $13.99 price is a bit steep so be prepared for that. IMO, you should at least get a side or bag of chips for that price but hey, I'm sure their rent ain't cheap and when your food is that good it's kinda hard to complain. I do wish they would give you a larger plastic cup for water drinkers like myself. It looked like one of those Dixie bathroom cups you use to rinse your mouth out lol. I know they do that as a deterrent so you will order a tea or something but i did find that little tiny cup laughable. But that won't stop me from going back. Next up, the Reuben.",

    "text": "Yankees.....hear ye, hear ye! For all my fellow northerners who've been searching for a genuine NY-style bagel shop this side of the mason dixon, you have a very viable option with Poppy's!!  I learned of this place thanks to my trusty Yelp and then instantly bookmarked it thanks to Candyce B's review. I showed up this morning around 10:30 and there was a line that only continued to grow as I waited. Poppy's is small on the inside space so things can get a little cramped as you try to make your way around.  Poppy's offers homemade, kettle boiled bagels. This fact is important because it's one of the things that distinguishes these bagels from the rock solid ones found at Panera and the like. The selection this morning included honey wheat, salt, plain, pumpernickel, everything, and a couple more that I cannot remember. They also have homemade cream cheese available in a handful of flavors. Besides the typical bagel shop offerings, they also serve eggs benedict, omelets, pasta and potato salads, and soup. Again, all homemade in the store.   I ordered the breakfast special: bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel with a small coffee. I got mine on an everything bagel. You order and pay at the counter and then they call and bring out your order (if it's something that's cooked/prepared) on the side. This was my first time having an everything bagel and? IT WAS EVERYTHING. The bagel was soft and chewy with a light crisp and the flavors didn't overpower the bacon and egg. I had always steered away from everything bagels because I was afraid of the onion/garlic being too overwhelming but this one wasn't. The coffee is serve yourself style and they had french vanilla, hazelnut, dark roast, original, chocolate raspberry flavors alongside skim milk, milk and half and half options.   Poppy's was/is delicious and I'll be back as much as I can when I pass through the area.",

I always worry when a restaurant has few-to-no customers at peak times.   As far as the bagels, one was soft and the others were more on the well done side. The toasted bagel was very good, and my wife really enjoyed the everything with vegetable cream cheese. On the other hand, we live in Huntersville and usually go to Bagel Bin. While Poppy's Bagels are good, we like Bagel Bin bagels more. We didn't try any sandwiches, soups, or salads at Poppy's Bagels, so keep that in mind. And a big positive for Poppy's Bagels is that their prices are better than Bagel Bin.  Overall, Poppy's Bagels is recommended. Since it's a long drive for us, we wouldn't go back unless in the area.

The menu is posted but they also offer specials during the week for breakfast and lunch so that's a total win!   Oh and there's a ridiculously good selection of salads in the display. So I'm sure you'll get sucked in like I did!   I opted for an Everything bagel with egg whites, cheese and bacon, with a small side of the BACON potato salad (yeah for breakfast...don't judge me).   My goodness that thing was good. The bagel was so fresh and perfectly toasted. It arrived to my table still hot with crispy bacon and a good amount of cheese....I practically inhaled it.

I took our dog with us just to get an order to go I was met immediately at the door and was told very nasty no dogs you must tie him up outside if you going to come in here. I will never go back here and everyone I talk to I will not recommend this place.  Fyi to management you may want to train your employees that service dogs are allowed everywhere. Our dog is not a service dog but the gentleman that told me this had no clue if he was or was not and didn't even ask.",

A salt, with plain cream cheese, lox, capers and onion is just like my Jewish Grandma use to make in NY.  (Truthfully, I didn't have a Jewish Grandmother but I am from NY and know a good bagel.) This place is fast and friendly.  You can try and find a tiny table in the tiny eating area with a cup of coffee, or you can go home and eat your bagel in front of the TV with your Sunday Paper-that is our preference.  They have a decent selection of sides (more CLT style than NY Deli-but they try) and the coffee is decent.",

Finally made it in the Saturday after Christmas and were met with a bustling, noisy crowd and a long line. Don't let the crowd fool you... It took us less than 10 minutes to order and find a table.   We had the breakfast sandwiches -- bacon, egg and cheese for me, sausage egg and cheese for him. Both on an everything bagel. Both AMAZING! The bagels had a great crunch but we're still soft inside. The fillings were fresh, flavorful and hot. We also tried a scone because I read a few good things in reviews here. The scone was just average; I've had better and worse. Next time (and, oh there will be a lot of next times!) we'll stick with what I'm pretty sure they do best... Bagels!! We're also looking forward to trying the homemade cream cheese. I spotted someone with blueberry cream cheese and might have drooled a little bit.",

I came to Poppy's with my four children 30 minutes before closing and then once closing time was close, the entire staff (minus one sweet teenage boy who stated it was only his second day) started yelling loudly to us and the other tables in the restaurant that we needed to, \"Get Out!! Because \"We're closed!\" They then turned off all of the lights and yelled again, \"Get out! Y'all have got to go! But, come back because we want your money!\" From the moment we entered Poppy's we were treated like we were an inconvenience, & frankly, like complete trash. We did not even receive one thank you. When I called the general manager to notify him of our experience in the hopes that he can make some changes, he stated that they should have not yelled, but should have approached our table and told us \"they were closed, so we would need to leave.\" Who does that?! What restaurant in this universe makes a family leave halfway through their meal after spending $60+ on four bagel sandwiches?! We had to throw them away, as we live an hour away.  RUN far away from this restaurant. What a major disappointment not only in our dining experience, but in humanity in general.",

I thought there was no way a no-name start-up business was going to do well there if Starbucks couldn't make it.  Looks like I was wrong.  We've visited Poppy's a couple of times for breakfast so far this summer.  They're a fantastic alternative to any other \"fast food\" breakfast place, including Panera.    I've only tried the breakfast bagel sandwiches, but they are excellent.  The bagels are fresh, delicious, and large.  You can get fried or scrambled eggs on them (a nice option that you usually can't find elsewhere), cheese, and/or meat.  For $4, it's a great value, too.  Their breakfast scones and muffin tops look delicious, too, but I try to be good and limit myself to only a sandwich.  Another bonus:  they have flavored coffees!   I've tried the vanilla, but the chocolate raspberry is my favorite.    I've never been for lunch, but the sandwiches they offer sound fantastic, too, and everything in the display case (like a grocer's deli area) looks fresh and good to bring home, too.    The seating can be limited, though, especially on the weekends when we go.  We've been fortunate that it's not hot (or raining) and there's been an empty table outside.  The inside is usually filled with kids/families for breakfast and the seating looks super-cramped.  I'm not sure how it is in the winter.    My only disappointment would be how one person takes your order and then you have to repeat the entire order to the cashier to ring it up.  There should be some way for the person initially taking the order to relay the information to the cashier.  It feels like a time waster, and if you're paying for your party, you may not remember everything they ordered!  I do highly recommend the bagels, though (the only thing I've really eaten there so far), because they're probably the best I've had in Charlotte.",

I constantly try to give them a chance and today's experience was the last one. I walked into Poppy's today at exactly 12:45pm and noticed a sign that said they were closing early at 1pm in \"observance of the Panthers game\". Okay, understandable if that's how you want to run your restaurant- since I'm taking this to go, walking in 15 minutes before you close should be acceptable. Plus the place was still fairly busy with customers that were eating and waiting for their bagels. Nonetheless, I stood in line to be ignored for the next 5 minutes. Not even a \"we will be right with you\" as they had their backs to me clearly more concerned with cleaning up everything before they closed.  At 12:50 I was finally acknowledged (and now there was a line behind me of customers that had arrived after me) and I attempted to order my usual egg bacon and cheese. The lovely gent that took my order rolled his eyes and huffed and puffed and told me the grill was closed because they were closing at 1. I pulled out my phone just to make sure I wasn't crazy, and I gave him a bewildered look like .... OKAY and your point ? Thats 10 mins away and I'm asking you to make me an EGG. You run a restaurant, and you're willingly turning away business. Sure dude. we have a restaurant of our own and unfortunately people walk in close to when you're closing, it's the name of the game. But you put a smile on and you do your job-or else get out of the restaurant industry.   Regardless of how good your food is, if your customer service sucks and you run a lazy staff and restaurant, you don't deserve my business. And based on their sanitation score (90) and details that can be found online, you can tell its pure laziness. I have no respect for that.",

After taking a quick look at the menu, I decided that a bagel breakfast sandwich sounded good and for $4.50 was a decent deal, so I went for the ham, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel. They had a number of side salads including potato salad, pasta salads, and various vegetable mixes but I figured a bagel sandwich would be enough for today and stuck with just that. (They also have some muffins, cookies, soups, paninis, other sandwiches, sodas, and a few different types of coffee). The sandwich came out pretty quickly, especially since they cooked my egg to order, and the worker brought it right to my table which was nice. Upon first bite of the sandwich though I was hugely disappointed. The bagel was very dry and extremely chewy and dense, and did not taste all that fresh. I also realized very quickly that the bagel was way too large for the scant amount of toppings (2 very thin slices of ham, a small egg, and maybe a full slice of American cheese but it may have only been a half slice because it covered only half the bagel). I ended up eating the rest of the sandwich as one open faced half with the toppings and one half plain bagel, but it didn't improve things a lot. I must say that the flavor of the everything bagel was really, really good. It had just the right amount of garlic and onion, and the seeds added a nice touch and didn't all fall off like they do at a lot of places. Unfortunately with the bagel being dry, it still wasn't very enjoyable. Maybe I'll come back to Poppy's to try a bagel with one of their cream cheese options and hope that the flavor of this bagel rather than the freshness is truly how their bagels usually are.",

You get at least one place with authentically New York bagels (although they are still working on the pizza here).  Big, chewy New York-style bagels. New Yorkers, you won't be dissatisfied, unless you get the cream cheese with lox. It's just bits of fish in cream cheese, not big, thin slices of fish, and no capers and the rest.  As for me, I go with the nontraditional bacon, egg and cheese toasted on an onion bagel. Boom. I'm done.  The coffee is HOT here, they sell newspapers, and you can sit inside or outside. There are parents and kids EVERYWHERE. It is Charlotte, after all.",

Not those things that Einstein's, Panera, DD and the like, try and pass off as a bagel. Poppy's delivers a great bagel that satisfies all the requirements. Perfect amount of chew, not hard, not dry, not bready, good flavor... Awesome.   The bagels are great, prices are good, friendly service. I just wish they were closer to the Southend! I can't wait to go back and try their matzoh ball soup!! Yum :)",

My food was all over the table no matter how careful I was trying to eat over the plate. Avocado was hard because it was not ripe. They should have smashed it and smothered it on the bagel ( that would have been better to serve). Small seating area definitely not for larger crowds.

Forgive me as a salivate over some of the things in the display case and jars.  My only gripe... bagels are sitting out in the open and I didn't really notice until I swatted a fruit fly away from my forehead. Is that sanitary???   They get points for friendliness and how much staff is in that joint. I was literally waiting for 5 seconds for my food. I swear I just ordered my food when all of a sudden I was handed my food. Nice job on getting people in and out!   Okay but on to my bagel. I hate to give a harsh review but ummmm it's aight. It looks like this place is beloved by many and I get it. They do have more than just bagels, but I'm a fan of places who specialize in something AND do it right.   Huuuu... why did I have to move away from \"The Original Brooklyn Water Bagel Co\" If you want a bagel done right, check that place out. It's in Ballantyne, but it just may be worth it for me to take a short ride out there.   Okay really... on to my bagel...  It was decent. But I was looking for something more filling. And that I know that sounds ludicrous because it's bread, but I mean I was looking for a thick slab of cream cheese, and thick hunk of tomato and like 3 piece of bacon. What I got was decent for $4. The flavor was good and the cream cheese was really good. It didn't taste like it was processed. My Onion bagel was pretty oniony and doughy. Surely didn't taste like it was frozen, but definitely a different taste from The OBWBC.   I'll visit again. Only because it's the better alternative to my fave bagel spot and not too far from my job. Heck! I may also try that coffee cake I was starting at some other time.",

We got a full bag of bagels one time just to get home and find the bagels were too burnt to eat. I tried emailing to ask if we could come back in for a new bag of bagels and no one ever responded. The last couple times we got bagels from Poppy's, they all tasted very strongly of garlic. But they weren't garlic bagels - they were plain and blueberry. They tasted like they had been doused in garlic powder. The first time this happened I thought it was just an accident (maybe some garlic powder spilled on the counter). But then it happened again. Maybe a plain bagel covered in would be ok if you like garlic, but a blueberry bagel covered in garlic is nauseating. I emailed Poppy's again.  No response. So at this point we won't be going back because bad food is one thing, but completely non existent customer service is another.",

It was probs the best tasting bagel I have had in this city. Absolutely fantastic. I noticed they had a handful of pastas, salads, cheeses, pastries, etc to order that also looked fantastic. Additionally, I got a hazelnut coffee and appreciated they had a few different flavored coffees.  We opted for to-go but there was a decent amount of seating outside.

The problem is the indifference of the counter people who seem to think that serving the in-house customers is of secondary importance to talking on the phone or with each other, or attending to chores, which while necessary, could be done AFTER taking care of customers. The Bagels are great and large enough that they won't fit in your average toaster, so they are worth the $15 price tag. Work on your bedside manner folks!",

In 2015 I was diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (when your white blood cells attack your esophagus due to food allergies). I can no longer eat DAIRY or WHEAT.  She literally could care less about gluten free people because \"they make too much money\" and also \"they make fresh bagels\".  She wouldn't even let me come in to drop off a FREE sample of \"NY STYLE\" Gluten Free frozen bagels (comes in every flavor) that a lot of NY bagel shops have in the EC.  People who are not gluten free don't understand what it is like to be turned away. Your customers should come first AlWAYS & not be hung up on.  It's not possible to make fresh gluten free bagels and fresh regular bagels (cross contamination). So the best next option is Frozen (if you are gluten free you could relate to me as long as we can eat it we don't care if it's fresh or frozen).  Anyway, I'm offended, hurt and was highly mistreated.   Just a quick fact....  \"Today, some 3.1 million people across the United States follow a gluten-free diet. 72 percent of them are classified as \"PWAGs\" - people without celiac disease avoiding gluten\"- Forbes Magazine   Moral of the story if you need to know where to get gluten free bagels in Charlotte feel free to inbox me or follow me on Instagram @yourallergyangel -  Believe it or not some bagel shop owners understand !",

I was pretty surprised to not see a list of bagel sandwiches on the menu. I was thinking it would be similar to Owen's bagels, which I love- it wasn't. I only saw a handful of basic breakfast bagel sandwiches (egg, cheese, meat or cream cheese). The rest of the menu consisted of deli sides and sandwiches on bread or ciabatta.    I got the basic egg, cheese and turkey sausage on an everything bagel (tasted). My husband got the chicken mozzarella sandwich on ciabatta. We waited about 10 minutes and bam our food was served. At first glance my bagel sandwich looked delicious. I bit into it and it was hard and somewhat burnt. Tasted stale. I look the top of my bagel off to only see a turkey patty literally 1/3 the size of the bagel and the egg was super thin. I could barely taste it. I took the top off to eat the rest. I'm not sure if it was because I got my bagel toasted or what, but it didn't taste good nor was soft on the inside like the other reviews. My husband's on the other hand was delicious and I would get that again hands down. Maybe I should of stuck with a basic bagel (not toasted) with their homemade cream cheese.....there's always next time.   I would go back and try Poppy's again because I think they deserve another try, but I'm not in any rush to go back soon.",

I've been on the hunt for a good bagel shop for a while now that I've been living in the South for a few years.  Good biscuits - easy to find; Good bagels - and impossibly task.  Until one day after my spin class, I wandered into Poppy's.  I had a ham/egg/cheese on a bagel, which was super fresh and made that morning.  They even scooped out the bagel for me so I wouldn't eat so much of the bread!!!  So accommodating.  I've been back a few times just to get a variety of a dozen bagels an some cream cheese.  They have a few other deli sides you can get by the 1/4, 1/2 or 1lb container.  Warning, if you want to go on the weekend, GO EARLY.  The line can be insane starting around 9:30am.  Goes somewhat quick though, because they are fully staffed to deal with the morning rush.  There must have been about 25 people in front of me, and I was ordering within 10-15 minutes.  This place is now a carbolicious regular for me, and I'm so happy to be eating some yummy NY style bagels again that taste good!",

As told by a friend, there is no need to go crazy here. Just like the key to a good sandwich, the X-factor to really setting it apart is good bread. I ended up getting a bacon, egg and cheese on poppy while my wife went with egg and bacon on an everything bagel. Definitely get the bagel toasted as it makes it a bit crispy on the outside and pulls the entire thing together. Also of the two bagels we got, we both agreed the everything bagel was better as it had a great hint of garlic that wasn't too overpowering. Certainly one of the best (if not the best) bagels in the city.   They have a lot of other fun stuff here from pastas to blueberry muffins that all looked amazing. I'll have to come back and try more of the menu sometime. Also I will give them props for having a quick system. We waited in a long line, but it moved quickly. By the time I paid and was getting my coffee, our to-go bag was already ready. While Owen's still holds my heart when it comes to crazy bagel sandwiches, Poppy's is a solid alternate option that I will be visiting again very soon.",

I'm not a bagel connoisseur, but I can confidently say that Poppy's are quite good.    I had a turkey on Honey Wheat bagel.  The sliced meat tasted very fresh and seemed to be of high quality.  They use very spicy mustard- -which is awesome.  I ordered mine with lettuce and tomato, both were fine.  The bagel, itself, was just the right level of crusty on the outside/soft on the inside.  It had a nice, nutty flavor too.   The service was okay.  It took a little while, and they seemed a little disorganized, but not a big deal at all. The space is attractive and clean.   The chairs and tables are crammed in a little tight for my taste, but- - again- - no biggie.  I'll definitely try Poppy's again.  I am much more of a morning-bagel person, so I look forward to going near breakfast time.",

We also ordered a small side dish of pasta salad that looked amazing from the display case - and it was. Our brunch was absolutely delicious!

They have a variety of fresh cream cheese flavors displayed as you'd seem them up north as well as an array of other products.  The service was excellent and welcoming.

Every morning Ronnie, the owner, starts his day at around 4am making everything from scratch.  They don't open till 7 and they close at 3 or 4pm, you do the math, that's dedication to freshness.  The front of house is run by a menagerie of friendly ladies including Ronnie's mother Georgiana.  They do their best to handle your order timely but as some have said they do get quite busy around peak food times--get in a bit before or after for a swift and personable meal.  My staple meal is an everything bagel, toasted, add mayo, cheese, fried egg and bacon or the country ham.  It's rather cheap and really good.  Other times I surf their specials from chicken parma panini or Ronnie will make a slow cooked brisket from time to time which is really delicious.  Easily the best bagel in Charlotte and now their starting to sell them around the area.  If you are a fan of Katz hidden away at the Arboretum them you can enjoy their bagels there.  As a coffee geek I'm a little let down that their coffee service is par to sub par but that's really their only weak point.  One day they might get a coffee geek in their work-staff and then that could turn around.  Otherwise they are family, hard working, and dedicated to good products!",

If you know good, New York bagels then you'll be overjoyed to find Poppy's.  Close your eyes when you bite down into the bagel of your choice and you'll be transported to Manhattan.  They're fresh, often still warm from the oven and simply perfect.  Why a Four Stars instead of a Five?  They're a little (not a lot, just a little) on the high side price-wise.  A buttered bagel is a reasonable $1.50 with tax.  With cream cheese, still pretty reasonable at $2.25 with tax.  But buttered bagel with swiss cheese?  OMFG!  Five frikkin dollars?  Gimme a break.  I thought she made a mistake when I saw the price but she said, \"Well, it's four slices of swiss.\"    No worries.Next time I brought my own slices of swiss and discretely added them to my buttered bagel.  (I'd give em 4 1/2 stars if I could.)  OK, that gripe aside, I've never had anything here I don't like.  If you're Jewish you probably know \"kugel\" (noodle casserole).  Man, this was the bomb.  Tasted just like my mother made it.  Wow.  Had a mediterranean pasta salad; yum.    There are twin young women who work behind the counter who are a delight.  It's a friendly place and people seem eager to please.  If you're ever looking for me; head to Poppy's on any Sunday morning around 10am and you'll find me there enjoying.",

And I will admit, I am a bit of a bagel snob. What can I say? NY bagels spoiled me.  Enter Poppy's.  Real NY bagels made by real NY transplants. Egg bagels. Cinnamon Raisin bagels. Garlic Bagels. Honey wheat bagels. Poppy seed bagels (obviously). Scallion cream cheese (as is often the case with a fine bagelry, you might want to ask them to go light on the schmear). Sandwiches (both breakfast and otherwise). Brewed coffee that doesn't taste like it came out of an unmentionable part of a dog.  A dozen of Poppy's finest may have found their way home with us after we finished our breakfast. And I may have eaten one every day this week. And I might have already marked on my calendar when we are going to run out so I can back and get more...maybe.",

Take a ride up Providence and you will be relieved to find that ever elusive great bagel, with wonderful people behind the counter.

Coffee was just OK but I honestly don't think they care much about anything except the bagatorial arts up in Poppy's and in that distinguished category, they get an A+. Sad to me that Bore's Head is what they have for slices and cheeses since that stuff is just nasty, but hey.  No more Bruegger's for me. No more terrorizing Owen. I get Poppy bagels, I eat Poppy bagels, I love Poppy bagels.  note - these suckers are such globs of gluten that they don't age very well - freeze 'em, if you must, instead of sitting 'em in the breadbox.",

    "text": "Finally! A real bagel place in Charlotte! Poppy's reminds me of bagel places I used to frequent in the Bronx. Absolutely fantastic bagels, which they make in house. They have a cooler filled with all sorts of deli yummies, which I'm always tempted to order, but I usually fall back on my standard pumpernickel bagel with cream cheese and lox, which they serve with capers, tomato, and red onion. Scrumptious.   The line is long on the weekends, especially on Sundays when the after-church crowd comes in, but it moves quickly and I never worry about getting a seat, even when I'm there with my while family. The owners and staff are so friendly- I can't believe there are complaints about service,  because I've never had a problem. They were nice the first time I was there, and by the third time I was a regular. They know my name, call me hon, and compliment my kids. With that, delicious food, and great coffee, what more can I ask for?",

I came in with the idea that I was just going to have a bagel but while waiting on line i decided I would get the Prosciutto Paninni with Mozzarella. After waiting what felt like forever because they were pretty unorganized I ordered it with a side of a Dozen Bagels...for the fam of course!   Well the girl helping me was kinda rude she was talking with another girl working and looks at me and was like I'm listening while she has her head turned to the other girl and is still carrying on with they're conversation...really am I supposed to yell my order out just so you may be able to catch it or how about you look at me and actually look like you care..and the owner was standing right there but didn't even take it in...very unprofessional! So she now looks at me and says she will be right back to put my sandwich order in and will be right back, I was in the way of the other people trying to order and pay but I needed to pick out my bagels, she returns and i find myself yelling out everything at the same time trying to not get in people way...There has got to be a better way of doing this! No?  So we sit and my sandwich comes out and it was ok the meat was cut too thick for my liking but it was ok. I tried the bagels later on and they were ok better than some of the places in Charlotte but not the best Ive ever had.",

These are the only bagels we have had here in Charlotte that actually taste like New York bagels. They are incredible! I would give it five stars were it not for the grumpy service I have received during post-church rush hour. Alas, everybody has a bad day and perhaps this gentleman was so excited to see the line out the door, that he forgot to be pleasant to his coworkers and customers.   I am not a fan of putting sandwich fixings inside a bagel so I cannot speak to lunch options but they do look good! (Not to be a buzzkill, but do you know how many calories are in a plain bagel? The New York Times once did a story on NY bagels and found that the calories per bagel - no cream cheese - ranged from 380 to 800 dependent on the size. Yikes!) I prefer to keep my bagels plain and simple - simple like chocolate chip cream cheese. Yes, I did say chocolate chip cream cheese. And I will confess that I have ordered a bagel (just one) so I could validate the purchase of a small tub of chocolate chip cream cheese - pay for it by weight.   Check out Poppy's Bagels - and definitely try the chocolate chip cream cheese. Yum.",

The line moved fairly quickly, but it was just a cluster of confusion in the restaurant.   We had two bacon, egg, and cheese bagels and felt they were remarkably average. They have 4 coffee options but none of the flavors were just standard blend medium roast - they had hazelnut, dark roast, French vanilla, and chocolate raspberry. Where was a standard flavor?   Also the patio was extremely dirty - cigarette butts, ashes, and just general debris was scattered about. They need a broom and a power washer!   Pro tip: Go to Owen's Bagel instead!",

Upon entering, I wasn't greeted, and the cashier finally turned and asked if I had texted an order in. When I told her no, she told me to go back (where I had been standing) and someone would take my order.   After paying, I only waited 2 to 3 minutes to receive my bagel. There was an empty 2-seater near the counter that I sat and waited at. There were a few larger tables inside and an enclosed patio area that some patrons were seated in. A really nice spot for breakfast or lunch on a cool morning like today.   I am on my way into another appointment, so I have only been able to take two bites, but boy were those two tasty?! I can't wait to get back to it after my meeting and maybe grab a bag of chips to go with it.   I also got a butter bagel, which I will add pics of later. It's just ok, but I'll add some flavorful cream cheese to it later to jazz it up.   The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the service in the beginning and the fact that $9 is a bit pricey for a lox bagel in my opinion. I saw a couple of things on the menu that referenced NY, which made sense because the place does remind you of a (semi) traditional NY deli. However, I was not happy about the NY price tag. #ijs  I will be trying this place again. Maybe on a Saturday morning if they're open, and definitely with my fiance so I don't have to pay!",

You would think that would be a good sign and yes it normally is, this day they were struggling to keep hot food coming out so order something cold.  That's what did, unfortunately my wife and mother did not and theirs was a miss this trip.  We normally love this place and will be back soon.  Bagels are solid normally, the portion of smoked salmon on mine was very small compared to a typical NY deli but at only 7.99, half the price so I am ok with half the portion.  We will be back soon to give them another try.",

I typically get \"The Works\" bagel without capers and some breakfast item (seasonally flavored pancakes, french toast, eggs with ham/bacon, etc) and have yet to be disappointed. So much more than bagels available at this authentic NY style deli.  The staff is pretty friendly, my fave is the gentleman at checkout. He always makes me laugh with his witty comments. Today, I tried their apricot and raspberry Rugelach...delicious! They also offer lots of beverages including coffee, tea, all sorts of juices, sodas and bottled water.  They have some indoor seating as well as some seating in the covered patio. They will call your name and bring your order to you so feel free to grab a seat.   If you have never been there, this is how it works: Find your place in line and try to decide what you want quickly as your turn will come sooner than expected. Give your order for everything except drinks and baked goods to the person behind the counter. You will be given a pink paper with your order. Take it to the register and tell the witty man what you want to drink or what baked goods you want to add to your order. He will tally everything up and charge you as well as give you cups for your hot beverages (if any) and serve you your baked goods (if any). Pay the nice man (remember to tip!), grab your beverage and have a seat while you wait for your order to be served. Enjoy your delicious meal!",

Stood in a long line on a Sunday afternoon trying to buy a dozen bagels. Not really set up for selling bagels by the dozen. There were tons of people behind the counter making bagel sandwiches to order, which seems to be the primary focus of the store.  I liked it enough to come back. Hopefully I can try a lox, cream cheese bagel with all the trimmings. I bet it will be good.  Side note...the staff seem quite pleased to spend time with each other, which is a good sign. Happy food preparers hopefully follow the health rules and a re proud of their work. They just did not seem as interested in the customers. I have been spoiled by the customer focus that other Charlotte businesses have.",

First time was a simple ham, egg white (yes!!!), and cheese on sesame.  Wrapped in aluminum foil and tossed in the bag, it stayed warm until I could eat it about 30 minutes later.  During my first visit I noticed that they had homemade cream cheeses in the display case, one of which had jalapeno's in it.  I knew I had to try it, so got the same sandwich as above, just with the jalapeno cream cheese instead of sliced cheese.  Incredible.  My father-in-law is a huge fan of smoked salmon, whitefish salad, etc., so I had to take a picture of the huge display in the store and e-mail it to him.  Looked like a great selection, although that stuff isn't my cup of tea.",

I greatly appreciate a good bagel with cream cheese and pretty much at any point in the day.   Poppy's totally delivers. A quaint shop off of Sharon Amity/Providence with a a ton of options. A semi-shotgun set up with ample seating and plenty of natural light. A great place for breakfast with a buddy or the whole family. Also, there are 4 coolers filled with beverages. OJ, other juices, sodas, milk and tons of other choices. I'm a big morning beverage person so this is much appreciated.   There is also a ton of other items the main cooler. Deli items galore and plenty of salads of all types and chopped items good for a picnic or potluck.   Now, the bagels. Phenomenally large bagels with a nice chew and plenty of space for schmearing butter or cream cheese. The honey wheat and blueberry variety were choice and both are worth their weight. Many other flavors to choose from and I can't wait to check the rest of them out. Love that they slice the bagels all the weight length wise and only half of the way for the width. Super helpful when you're driving and need to tear off a honkin' piece!  The staff is super friendly and they move quick. Love it and can't wait to head back in for breakfast!",

I don't drink it, but according to my husband, they have a good iced coffee and he likes that so it makes me happy too.   The only reason I am knocking one star is b/c of how crazy busy it is at times- which I know isn't there fault and is a good thing for them, it makes me a bit crazy and I feel claustrophobic so I typically try to go early morning or off times to avoid this.",

Their bagels are fresh, the food is good, and their staff is friendly and fast. The prices are a little high, but to me it's worth it for a good bagel.  I'll usually get their everything bagel with jalapeno cream cheese or eggs which is always good. On occasion they'll have a jalapeno bagel which is my favorite. My fiance usually gets their white fish salad or lox spread and they're consistently very good.  I typically come here for breakfast, but they have a pretty big lunch menu along with a variety of salads and baked goods at the counter.   One thing I wish was better was their coffee. To me it seems pretty below average and I usually just have coffee before I come.  If you see a long line or no tables, don't let that deter you. The staff is extremely fast at getting your food out and tables typically open up pretty quick.",

I'm glad I added mayo or it would have just been meat and lettuce on bread. I will probably stick to only breakfast from now on.",

Because they would not allow me to order over the phone, I drove to the location to place my order and the staff continued to be rude and dismissive. For being a bagel place, they have have very limited bagel options compared to Einstein Bagels and even Panera Bread. I ordered the Asiago bagel with jalapeno cream cheese. It was subpar, nothing special. You honestly might as well go with a different restaurant where you'll get good tasting food and good customer service.

More often than not, when you go it will be busy but the staff is so efficient and will get your food out pretty quickly which is awesome.

Like many in Charlotte, I am a transplant from the north. This is the closest you'll find the northern jewish deli/bagel venue. You can get a cheaper bagel and meal deal at Brueggar's or Einstein's. but the quality won't be near what Poppy's has to offer.   Aside from their bagels, I enjoy trying their different flavored coffees, salads, and most definitely their rotating fresh pastries. For the northerns that can't find Italian cookies, Poppy's has excellent cookies shipped from NY and you won't find anything like them in this city.   Don't let the lines scare you. It may be long, but I have never waited more than 20 minutes. They know how to handle volumes of people quickly and well.",

I've been to Poppy's about 3-4 times now, and one thing's for sure - my weekday experiences are vastly different from my weekend visits.  Simply because the wait can be long and slightly chaotic on the weekends, I would either recommend going as early as possible or simply go on a weekday.  The big, meaty bagels are super tasty and filling (That's what SHE said - hehe).  I've also had the bacon-egg and cheese croissant a few times as well.  The super soft croissant its served on is like biting into a soft, buttery cloud.   I've only been here for breakfast, but this spot also seems like a great lunch option - with several made-to-order Paninis and gourmet soups and salads.  The service has always been great.  Everyone is super friendly and personable.  The inside of the establishment is always clean with plenty of natural lighting.  In addition to the limited seating scattered throughout, there's a small outdoor area with about 10 tables.    If you are like me, and are a NY transplant and in constant search for delis and eateries that remind you of home - Poppy's is gonna do an excellent job of jogging your memory!",

It was over $14 for 2 bagels and 1 coffee, so it's not an everyday kind of place.  It was very crowded, and some people had to stand around waiting for tables. The bathroom was clean.

This was my first time trying Poppy's and it was a stellar experience. I went around 11 AM and it was the perfect time as parking was easy and my wait was minimal.  Poppy's is clean, the service is friendly, and the food is great. I ordered a bacon, egg, & cheese on an everything bagel and it's by far the best breakfast sandwich I've had in Charlotte. I've frequented Owen's Bagels quite a few times and they are only a short block or two down from Poppy's. Owen's is good but they steam their bagels whereas Poppy's is more traditional NY style (toasty on the outside, chewy on the inside). Keep that in mind when trying to decide between the two.  Overall, I highly recommend Poppy's. I'd advise to plan ahead and be prepared to find creative parking if you are going during early morning commute hours or early on the weekend (not new news for that area so if you're familiar with South Blvd - you know what to expect).",

Honestly, Poppy's has great bagels, but they didn't wow me with the sandwich. I recommend skipping the sammy and just going with a regular cream cheese bagel. They have a huge selection of flavored coffee, but it's pretty base line. It's a small business so can get crowded inside and the only view of the menu is right when you're up to order, which can be overwhelming on a busy Saturday morning. The patio area is nice, covered with fan, but still can be HOT on a warm Charlotte summer day. I was also a little surprised by their \"iced coffee\" selection. I picked up the picture and found that the \"iced coffee\" was super hot, like they'd just brewed it and were waiting for it to cool down or just be poured over ice. Honestly, it's a pet peeve of mine when people offer iced coffee that's really just regular coffee to be poured over ice. Don't offer it if you can't get it right. A customer would rather order something else then have something that is sub-par. Overall, the experience was average, I wouldn't rush back there if I'm visiting the area, but as a local I could see myself grabbing a bagel to go.",

The schmear has to be homemade right? Because I dabbled in the chive and the vegetable - both were equally tasty.   Inside Poppy's has a smattering of tables and a cute little patio outside where Riley (my pup) enjoyed some bagel bits off of the concrete. Tasty. Be aware that the patio can be quite noisy with the umpteen cars passing down Providence and Sharon Amity, but no worries, I had my bagel and great company.   Next time I'm in the area, I'm definitely going to pop in and pay homage to Poppy's by indulging in a nice toasty bagel and a pound of cream cheese. Nice to know that there's another local bagel joint in CLT!",

Ordered a bagel sandwich; egg (wasn't scrambled, good!), sausage and cheese on plain bagel. four bagels; two Everything, one Salt and one Blueberry, two individual sides of cream cheese; one scallion and one blueberry, Two fresh chocolate chip scones and two coffees.  Order total was $23. Reasonable. I feel like this was a lot of fresh food for a descent price.  A few more details about the items;  The sausage on the sandwich seemed homemade and very fresh. Not too spicy,but a little heat. Very tasty.  Bagels were large, chewy, crusty outside with fresh airy inside. Everything was very flavorful. Salt bagel had right amount of sat, very good, Blueberry lacked a good berry flavor, so that was disappointing.  The cream cheese appeared to be mixed in store. Both the scallion and blueberry had the desired favors without being overly strong.  The scones were soft and full of chocolate chips. They were very fresh and flavorful. Maybe a little on the dry side, which I think scones are supposed to be, so enjoy with milk, coffee or tea.  Worth the visit for sure.",

I had sausage, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel, and it definitely hit the spot I was seeking to fill. The sausage wasn't quite my taste (next time I'll try the bacon) but this was more than offset by the great preparation of the fried egg, with a thin layer of yolk distributed throughout.   As for the bagel itself, the texture, flavor, and chewiness were on the mark, albeit missing that je no sais quoi in NY bagels. Maybe it's the water? I don't know, but I'll be back for more.",

The specialty cream cheese is made fresh every morning. I picked the veggie spread and it was delicious! Talk about fresh pieces of bell pepper...yum!  I steered clear of the coffee based on the other reviews. Since my main goal was to eat a bagel during this stop, I didn't try much else on the menu. However, husband got a veggie omelet. It was very tasty and came with a buttered bagel on the side. They have about 3 or 4 other types of omelets on the menu, none of which are vegetarian, but you can make your own ($.50 per item, so it can add up quickly)...so goes the veggie lifestyle. They have a variety of bagel sandwich options too, which I will have to return to try.  If you are in need of some jewelry, they sell that too...nicely displayed on a wall. Random, yes, but you can kill a couple birds with one stone here!",

We all felt very insulted by her and felt like it was something that needed to be addressed.  Not only did she have that attitude with us but with many of the elderly people which saddens me to think that since its a breakfast place she might be ruining everyones day with her poor attitude or will to work there.  Her appearance was black hair, New York accent, mid age.  Now that i think about it it could of been the owner since, if she worked for me she would be fired by now.     Thanks,  Gabriella Zubiate",

First timers can't go wrong with the jalapeno cheese and a plain bagel, but I suggest the tuna salad on an asiago cheese bagel if you want to go all out.

They also have soups, salads, and lox, so similar options to Jewish delis that I have been to in NJ. I'm a big garlic fan, so I always get their garlic bagel. It's covered (covered!) in minced garlic, which is great. You may not be able to breathe on anyone afterwards, but it is so garlicky and tasty. My family is from NJ, so I always get the Taylor Ham which I was so excited that they have here. If you don't know what Taylor Ham is, you should definitely try it once. It looks similar to Canadian Bacon, tastes kinda like fried bologna and is sweet and sour. I can't do it justice, but it is a treat in the breakfast sandwich. I think they skimp a little bit on the meat, so I always ask for double Taylor Ham. Like others said, Poppy's can get crazy on the weekend. The parking lot is sufficient (most of the time) but it can be very difficult to find spots if you happen to coincide with classes at Flywheel, which is in the same shopping center. They do a good job of managing the line though so you don't feel like the service is slow.  Overall, it's a great, relatively quick and cheap breakfast choice.",

Their salads they have in their front case are good too, just wish they had labels on the different kinds, since it is a bit of an inconvenience to both myself and the order taker to go through and tell me what all of them are.

Everything, Sesame, Pumpernickel, all the classic flavored bagels and they're all large and fresh and fluffy with the great chewy and crunchy bagel texture that they are supposed to have.  Tip: spend an extra buck and get the salmon spread on your toasted bagel.  It's probably not the sort of place where you sit around all day, like a Starbucks or Panera, but it's nice for a quiet coffee (good coffee, by the way!) and a friendly meet with your buddies.

I got two bagels to go, a blt on a salt bagel and an everything bagel with cream cheese for a friend. We loved them. I am always wary about ordering bacon at restaurants because I cannot stomach the weird, limp stuff. I'm glad I decided to go for it, though, because this bacon was perfect & crisp and they didn't skimp. The bagels themselves were perfect and just a little chewy, just how I like them!",

I was homesick for a good bacon, egg and cheese bagel sandwich.  I longed for the perfect bagel, that one fills you up, but doesn't make you feel too full of bread.  Then I found Poppy's, and the bagel hole in my stomach was filled again.  Poppy's is a fantastic, friendly NY bagel shop.  They have all sorts of flavors of bagels, and stock them well into the afternoon - even if you go in right before they close at 3pm, you'll probably be able to get a sandwich on your choice of bagel.  The bacon is always great and not too soggy.  And they'll make you egg white sandwiches too.   They are quick, and always greet you like you're a regular - no matter how long it's been since your last bagel.    I have been hoping that Poppy's will find its way down to the Ballantyne area, but for now it remains my \"on my way up-town\" luxury.    Oh!  And they have a credit/debit minimum.  So if you're not going to spend $5, be sure to have cash.",

He blurted out a gross remark after I paid for my food when he thought I was just out of earshot because I was having difficulty with deciding which size container of cream cheese to buy. Said I should learn my measurements... The few times he served me at the register before this experience, he had an aggrivated demeanor about him.

They provide a wide variety of bagels and make both breakfast and lunch sandwiches out of them.  My only problem with this place is they offer a ton of other delicious looking stuff I want to try from their deli and desert counters but because I can only get over there on rare chances, I stay True to my cravings for bagels. Some day I'll try a Blintz or their pasta salad or some of their other deserts. I've also been told I must try their croissants.  The staff is always friendly and the line moves pretty quickly.

The staff itself seemed put out hat we came in and wanted to eat. A few min to 3 the vacuuming began. We started leaving but the door was blocked by vacuum chords, staff, and trash cans. By the time my grandfather, with his poor balance, navigated the obstacle course we then had to dodge plants being watered and staff chatting outside.

I need to mention that the bagels are DEFINITELY not the reason I'm only giving 3 stars. If I had only ever had the bagels, I would easily give Poppy's 5 stars. I LOVE the bagels. They're bigger than most places in the area, and the cream cheese doesn't taste overly sweet like other bagel shops where it tastes like powdered sugar was added to the cream cheese.  My biggest complaint is the cannoli. Specifically the filling. I have ordered over 40 cannoils from Poppy's over the span of a year and a half, and literally... not one single time has it been right. Sometimes there is a huge gap in the middle with no filling, sometimes there's just a line of filling and you can literally look right through the cannoli and see what's on the other side. Every time, I say \"Please make sure it's actually filled.\" I literally feel like it's overkill for me to have to say it. I was assured today that it would be completely filled. Guess what?! It wasn't. I've complained about this several times, and stopped getting cannolis because of this, and I was having a pregnancy craving today, and ONCE AGAIN the cannoli was basically empty. I'm tired of them telling me that you can't fill a cannoli all the way. You can. I lived in Italy and make cannolis at home. I have never had \"settling\" issues or gap issues. You have to spend more than 5 seconds to fill it! That's literally all you do-- you take a little more time, and boom, it's filled! I would LOVE to show the staff how to fill a cannoli, but apparently, they don't need my help. (Trust me, the do need my help.)",

We tried pastries two different times and the donut was the STALEST donut I've ever had. My daughter who never turns down sweets even refused it. We also got a cookie once and it was ROCK HARD. Shame on them for serving stale pastries. If you go, stick to their bagels and cc.",

By far the beat bagel I've had here in Charlotte since I've moved from NEW YORK!  Their bagels have the perfect crunch/texture on the outside and perfectly soft in the inside.   If you're in the area, definitely stop in!!",

I mean you can always take it to go, right? The freshly baked bagels make you wonder why you'd ever go anywhere else for a bagel. Definitely a favorite - plus we love the outside seating option for nice weekend days",

The wait was much shorter than I anticipated, but it did feel kinda cramped in there with the line wrapping around.  I had an everything bagel, lightly toasted, with veggie cream cheese. It was massive and delicious. Loved the fresh bell pepper in the spread!  Since they have \"and More\" in their name, I probably shouldn't have been surprised, but they do have a ton of other offerings if you're not craving a bagel. I was particularly intrigued by the array of salads in the cold case, and I'll definitely make it a point to drop in for lunch sometime.",
