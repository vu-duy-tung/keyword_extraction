It has the advantage of being the only restaurant within 2 miles of the adjacent hotel.",

However, I go less frequently and probably will not return. The past 9 out of ten times, the service is beyond awful. My last visit was on Friday, 4/10 and I went for a late lunch, arriving around 2 p.m. Of course the dining area was closed and a sign stated to site at the bar area or outside. We chose to site at a two top in the bar area. There were only a few other patrons there. The server finally took our drink order and gave use menus.  She then dropped the drinks off and took our food order. A food runner dropped our food off. My friend had to flag someone else down since her order was incorrect. Once again, I received poor service and they were not busy at all. I guess it is normal for the servers to think they do not have to put in an effort when they are not busy. She never refilled my drink nor came back to check on us. My friend had to flag her down to get a to go box. I asked for a to go cup and the server asked did I want it filled up, after looking at my empty drink. To make matters worse, there was a gnat flying around and finally in my food, so I only ate half my salad. I am sure the server saw me swatting but cared less. Needless to say she got no tip and lost two customers. I am sure this review will make no difference to the business since I have complained several times online and got no response. Before I have sat outside and the server actually forgot about us.  Again, had to get up and flag server down. There is NEVER a manager present.",

The drawback here is the location; it's in the middle of nowhere. There is really NOTHING else on this road other than office buildings, and that's about it. So of course it draws mainly a corporate crowd, which is a shame, because True sports fans are missing out.",

Didn't count the exact number, but enough flat screens so that each game was up on at least 2 TV's.  Each TV was labled with the game so it makes it easy to find the game you are interested in and get a seat.  There were quite a few people there watching the games and the atmosphere was good.  Everyone was friendly and chatted about their teams and plays from the different games going on.  I orderd the chicken wings with along with onion rings.  Pretty standard wings, the sauce was pretty good, but the wings were a little over cooked, but still good.  The onion rings were probably frozen, but still OK for me.  The had some beer specials going on which is pretty standard.  The service was OK too, the only mishap was the server brought blue cheese for my wings instead of ranch, but she quickly got me a ranch when I told her about the mistake.  You typical chain sports bar.  The food was OK but, I would probably go back here for the TV's and atmosphere.",

I ordered the salmon and veggie salad which was decent - the salmon was well made and the veggies were grilled. The salad itself was basic. I also had a glass of there house merlot for $7. They do have a lot of variety so if you're craving a burger or wings, it's probably the place to go.",

I ordered the Swiss cheese and mushroom burger with no bun and a side salad rather than fries. What I got was a Swiss cheese and mushroom burger with no bun with some iceberg lettuce. It was comical. No lettuce, tomato, or onion was on the plate as was in the description. Maybe they consider a pile of iceberg lettuce a side salad?

We got our drinks rather quickly but it took forever for the waitress to take our food order. When the food did come, it was mediocre. I ordered a chicken sandwich and a beer and my wife ordered onion rings and a strong bow. That was literally the last time I saw my waitress. She had our section and the patio area. Why would you not schedule more help on a Friday night?? Poor customer service and shame on management for not preparing better. Warm beer and mediocre food. Not what I was expecting!!!!",

Our server (Shaun, I think) suggest we try their honey mustard grilled chicken sandwich. It was great and the same price as their chicken sandwich without cheese or bacon. I also had a cup of their clam chowder and it was superb! Shawn took great care of us. The place was obviously busy, but he was prompt and even took the time to chat with us. I would give five stars, but the decor was very, VERY dated and dark. The wood paneling we sat next to seemed to be peeling off the wall and there were stains on the carpet near us. They decor just makes you feel gross. Paint the walls brighter and get rid of that old carpeting and this place would be the perfect spot.",

They didn't have anything open elsewhere, but from the looks of it there were plenty of seats available inside.  We mentioned it would be cold outside, but they said they had heaters out there (they were not on and would not come on when we tried to get them on).  There are plenty of tv's outside - only 2 were large flat screen, while others were small tubes.  I agree with one of the other reviewers how the staff members are like zombies, they are not very responsive.  Service was extremely slow for a slow night at the restaurant.  Took awhile for everything from getting menus outside, then drinks, food, and eventually our bill.  Food is very bland, lacking good flavor.  I was wanting a combination of the chicken and burger sliders - you get 4 of the sliders (I wanted 2 of each chicken and burger) and both are the same price, but they would not combine the two.  So Kevin and I just got the chicken sliders and split them.    It was a convenient place for us at the time, but there are plenty of better sports bars in the area with better tasting food and service.",

The place did not seem to be super busy and we would have sat at the bar if that were an option because by the time we got back in the car and drove to another location to eat, lunch was almost over!! So needless to say, our once a month lunch together was ruined and we ended up with fast food in the car so he would not be late getting back to the office.

It's an A-OK restaurant with some beer specials and your regular bar food like burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.  Nothing really stands out, but sometimes that's okay.  Sometimes you just want regular bar food and a few brewskies.  And Jocks and Jills fills the bill.  One thing I like about the restaurant is its high ceilings.  It doesn't make you feel as confined as other restaurants, and there is a lot of seating.  I'm surprised they've been able to stay in business because I never see it very busy, but I hope they'll be able to stick it out until they do something with the old Coliseum area.  It would be nice to have a \"neighborhood bar\" still there.",

I sent them back and I over heard the gentleman in the booth behind me send his back for the same reason. I did enjoy the sandwich and fries that I ordered afterwards. If im in the area again, I dont know if id go back, maybe if there are no other options.",

I will say that the mahi-mahi sandwich was quite good. But what sold me was the young bartender, who allowed my friend and I to order just before the kitchen closed for the night. And before we could finish our $1.50 Miller Lite drafts, he brought over freshly-filled mugs -- gratis. That kind of service is definitely worth a star.",

Sure enough, 3 days later I got it in the mail (in Connecticut) with a nice note.   Great customer service... thanks JJ!",

I've had their salad (the lettuce was brown in some spots and warm), chicken sandwich (which was EXTREAMLY dry), and a few appetizers that I wasn't a big fan of.   The last time I was there, an hour lunch turned into almost 2 hours and I wasn't even there during rush hour. The waiter I had (I forgot his name) had the, \"I really don't want to be here today,\" attitude. He was very slow, probably waited a good 45 minutes just for a burger (my husband ordered) and a chicken sandwich (my order). When asked about the progress of the food, he just waved us off saying it's coming. When our meals finally came, they were cold and just nasty. It takes a lot for my husband to say, \"ok, this doesn't taste good,\" but he refuses to go back.   I could keep going on about this, but Im sure you've gotten the picture already. If you're passing by and you've never been there before, keep going down the road, it's not worth it.",

It can be really chaotic so sometimes we're waiting to get a bartenders attention for 15 min, and it's awkward hovering behind customers sitting trying to get their attention. I wish they would move take-out to the front. Overall it's convenient and the food is worth the price you pay.",

Decent sized menu with a pretty extensive selection of bar / pub favorites.  Food was fine: nothing mind blowing or memorable.  Everything came out in a reasonable amount of time and the prices were average for this type of establishment.

While cutting through the ribs I was worried I would slip down and my plate would go flying from pressing so hard down to try and cut through. They were so hard and dry it was sad. The bottom of the ribs were burnt black. I nibbled on them for a while because I couldn't be bothered sending them back and re-order. I still gave them a good tip because I ate at the bar and they were doing a good job. Please take your ribs off the menu, they make this place look really bad.",

I could look left to right and see 6 different shows  Mike served us at the bar.  He rocks. Very polite and personable.  I like observant bartenders and Mike is the king.  Biggest drawback here for me is the beer selection. The drafts are weeks with the exception of the Sweetwater IPA and OMB Copper. The later is a fallback beer for me: just saying.    They have a semi-ok.  They had the NODA Hip Drop 'N Roll in cans.  Works for me in a pinch.    Lots of meeting space and breakout rooms.  Definitely a great place to hold an event.

They have trivia and the service is a lot better and it's just a cool little place to grab a beer when waiting out local traffic. I added a star for that.  Original review: I eat here often for lunch, maybe once a month for awhile now, since it's close to work. I would say that the food is not bad but it's not wonderful. It's average. It's a good place to sit and have a beer during lunch, but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner unless you want to just eat while you watch sports and/or drink.  The main problem is inconsistent service. About 60 percent of the time, the service is ok. The rest is the time? Slowwww. I never come when it's busy either so it's just a matter of inattentive servers. I'm always wondering where they've gone or what on Earth they are doing aside from barely attending to the one or two tables in their respective sections.   My co-workers avoid this place due to this reason, but I still will come alone from time to time when I'm tired of everything else in the area.   There are a lot of TV's and a rather sizable bar. It always seems clean and organized. I'd say this place is ok. Not bad, not great, just ok.",

Service at the bar to pick up was nice and he accuracy of the order was decent (they forgot the extra blue cheese and extra crackers) and they also forgot it the 1st time I came it. The hostess was nice and showed me where to pick up the \"to-go\" orders. Burgers are good, fries were good, they have a kids menu so it's ok to bring the family. They have TVs and the place seem clean. Overall decent meal.",

The menu item you wouldn't think to order here- the fish tacos. My server recommended them and I was pleasantly surprised. They also have tater tots as a side item. Why don't all restaurants have toys?! App-wise, I like their wings and the chips with queso and homemade salsa.   I love how friendly the staff is here. The servers all know our group members by name. They take really great care of us.   Jocks is the home of both Nebraska (Go Huskers!) and North Dakota State watch sites. The bar is always full of people during college football games. They've got a ton of TVs. Nice sports bar option if you're in this part of town.",

The food menu was limited and the service was ok until the attitude when we questioned the price of our pitiful sandwiches. The wings were decent, but a little pricey for the quality($21.99 for 20)Scott the manager was very polite and willing to adjust our bill. Our waitress got an attitude and acted like it was our fault for not picking a side the she mentioned when telling us the menu, but not asking what sides we wanted with our sandwhich. Our chips were from a bag, for $6 chips, salsa and queso. Lots of TVs, great for watching football. We tipped her over 20% despite my objection.",

Tv's are plentiful, and even though there was no big event on, we had fun watching old football shows and reminiscing about the Panthers.   Our server was great; friendly and attentive but not hovering.  The food leaves you wanting better sports bar food. The nachos were tasty, but on really flimsy chips. The spinach dip was more of a fake tasting cheese sause than a fresh spinach dip. My burger (ordered medium) was more on the rare side, and the French fries left me questioning, \"should I have just gotten a side salad?\" It's a traditional sports bar menu that lacks some originality and flair.   You'll have a great time and eat a ton of calories! Just leave room for when you want REAL good bar food later.",

The place is always consistent they have a great happy hour and the service is always good. Morgan was my server tonight I sat in the bar area and she was quick and attentive. The food came out fast and the drinks were quick as well. I ordered a Philly steak sandwich that Morgan had suggested. I'm glad she did the meet was tender the hoge was soft and the Philly was outstanding.  This place is only about 10 minutes from the actual airport entrance with traffic. So if you are around at the Charlotte airport and you're looking for some good food, because there are not many restaurants in this area please stop in to this place you will not be disappointed.",

I had driven by this place many times with the passive thought of trying them out one day.  I ordered the chicken tenders and tater tots, a safe choice I often order for a new-to-me place that has mixed reviews.  I enjoyed the chicken.  I can tell the chicken was fresh and not frozen.  The breading on the chicken was very light, yet flavorful.  This made the chicken moist and not greasy.  The server said there was a mixup in the kitchen and apologized for my tots coming out after my chicken tenders, and I appreciated that because I enjoy eating food that hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp.  Our server was able to keep up with our small group by making sure we had drinks and were still \"satisfied.\"  I didn't find anything too special about this place which is why I'm giving it the three star review.",

My wife picked me up and I had picked out a restaurant I had wanted to try but when we got there, they were closed for repairs from Hurricane Florence.  Time for Plan B.   Had been here years ago. When it was built, it was across the street from the Charlotte Coliseum but that relocated years ago. Right off of Tyvola Road however so not hard to find.  It was pouring and while we made a wrong turn of two, we finally got there.  Got drenched coming up from our car but was warm and cozy of the inside  While we dried off, took a good lunch at the menu. Typical bar food but that's OK.  I had always want to try a Nashville Chicken Sandwich and since it was on the menu, decided to give it a try. My wife went with the Chicken Cordon Bleu Sandwich and both came with fries.  The Nashville Chicken was nice and spicy with a good heat and a kick. My wife's Sandwich was good but nothing to write home about.  Fries were good with a good balance of flavor and texture.  Service was pretty good but not outstanding despite the fact that it was mid afternoon and the place was mostly empty.  Atmosphere is typical sports bar.  For those of us who used to live in NE Ohio, this is a Cleveland Browns Sports Bar which did not go over well with my wife who is from Pittsburgh.",

It's evident that they are not likely using a mop in this establishment.  Nonetheless, this place is tucked in the midst of multiple business parks so, if you work in the area, you're likely to see one of your coworkers here as well. They have a designated parking lot with plenty of spaces.  I've been a here a few times and each time, the host/hostess has always seemed less than thrilled to be greeting people. They offer a short lunch menu that provides offerings such as soup/half sandwich combo, pizza & salad, and few other things at a reduced menu price. The regular menu is also available.  I've had a chicken sandwich and fried chicken salad on the separate times I've been here. Neither was memorable but the fries were pretty good.  Due to the proximity to my office, it's part of the regular rotation but there are better options elsewhere.",

My coworkers and I come here for lunch once in a while.  In the past year or so we've noticed the food and the service go completely down hill.  They used to have good fries, good wraps, good homemade potato chips., and above average food but that has since changed.    On a recent visit, the fries were worse than some fast food places, the chicken in a chicken enchilada was dry.  There was no salsa or tomatoes included in the poor attempt of additional toppings..,just shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream.  It was not very appetizing.    Service-wise, you better ask for a drink refill and your check when they bring out the food because servers have a tendency to disappear even when the restaurant is not busy.  Since today's visit my coworkers and I have crossed this one off the list of regular lunch spots.",

I work just down Tyvola and had not been for a few years, where it formerly was a pretty regular place to grab a quick lunch.  It was fine, nothing stellar, but it was fine for a quick, reasonably priced lunch.  I didn't see my old favorite of a fried chicken wrap on the menu, so I went with a fried chicken salad.  It was fine *shrug*.  Service was good enough and kept drinks filled and was prompt with getting us the check and processing payment.  It's a large restaurant with lots of seating, plenty of TV's throughout playing whatever version of a sport is on at the time.  It just seems J&J has lost it's buzzzzzzzzzzzz.    They do have quite a bit of outdoor seating, and they used to have TV's out there, though I didn't notice on the last trip if they were still there or not.  It was relatively busy for lunch, so they must still be doing okay with the office park crowd around here.  It was A-OK.",

If you are at the Hyatt across the parking lot for a week due to a work conference, you get stuck with the overpriced and bland stuff in the hotel or the overpriced and bland stuff here.  In three straight days, their drink specials have been either Bud Light or Miller Lite (depending on the day) at $2 a pint. That's it. Happy hour is non-existant. Well drinks are $6 each. I'd expect to pay that downtown but not out here in the boonies.  In addition, the food is not seasoned. Nothing special about the burgers. Chips and fries are just thrown in a fryer and then on the plate. Servers don't care too much about you and largely ignore you.  About the only plus is the outdoor seating and large number of televisions. If you are in a car, you would be better off going some place else. Otherwise, if you are stranded in the hotel, just suck it up and wait to go back home.",

    "text": "This is a fairly typical sports bar, but I think they have a few more tv's than thet typical sports bar.  Service was fair for as busy as things were on this night.  I ordered a Turkey Burger with fries and a Caesar Side Salad.  Thankfully, they did bring out the salad before the burger.  Unfortunately, they use a spring mix as the base for their Caesar Salad, so along with romaine you also get leaf lettuce, sliced carrots and some purple onion.  So it's got a little more variety.  The turkey burger was above average and appeared to have been made by hand (as opposed to frozen).  They offer a cajun ranch dressing that went well with the turkey and even better with the fries.  The fries were of the shoestring type and were among the better-tasting sports bar fries I've had in my day.  It's a nice place to go to get your sports fix and it has your standard bar fare.  Service is nothing special, but it has the market on the area surrounding the airport.  I wouldn't go out of my way, but if you're in the area...",

Otherwise, you can probably see 2-3 tv's from any seat in the place.  Foodwise, it's not the best of the bunch, but I usually get the ahi tuna salad.  It's a pretty sizeable portion and they use good healthy greens, and not too much iceberg. For lunch it's a tad long, but we went during March madness so I guess it was busy. Mainly we go when we want to catch a game.",

It fills the void of a sports bar with decent food, spacious booths, plenty of TV's (even on the patio) and friendly service. If you need a bar to catch a game, enter Jocks and Jills.    While there aren't any really special characteristics to this place, it's just fine overall. I snacked on a quesadilla and sampled hubs' turkey club. Both meals were just fine and quieted my rumbling stomach. I washed that down with a Blue Moon as the bar was out of champagne (for a mimosa) and Strongbow. Expect fairly priced eats to go along with your TV eye.   And hey - they have sweet potato tots. That's a win on its own!",

They have tons of tv's without a really bad view in the house. It's always packed for lunch but the line usually goes pretty quickly.  I'd check out Jock's & Jill's if you were in the area for lunch one day but probably wouldn't head that direction just to go there.",
