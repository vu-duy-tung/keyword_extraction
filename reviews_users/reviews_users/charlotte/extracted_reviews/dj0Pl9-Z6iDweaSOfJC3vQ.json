The groupon allowed me to purchase 24 dollars worth of food. In my order there were two burgers a order of nachos a half order of wings and two drinks.  It seems the biggest complaint for many is the price of the burger without sides. In all fairness there are lunch specials where you can get a whole combo for 7.00 The burger had a good taste although like another reviewer we didn't realize you have to specifically request typical items that come standard on most burgers. Even without these items the burger was a good size and taste. We especially enjoyed the nachos that were made with kettle chips instead of regular tortilla chips. It allowed the chips to remain crunchy instead of becoming soggy. The wings we ordered were the chipotle flavor and pretty spicy with almost too much vinegar but overall they were not bad. I will likely visit again during the lunch time just because 7 dollars is pretty steep by itself without that lunch special. The restaurant was clean and service was great.",

From the looks of the pictures on the wall, I was expecting a GREAT burger.  That is about where the experience ended.  Cashier greeted us and was friendly.  No real comments on wonderful customer service.  Make sure when ordering a burger or sandwich, you mention your toppings.  A co-worker of mine received a piece of chicken and a bun.  He was never informed that he needed to add toppings.  Salad looked better than all of the sandwiches.  Everyone in the group was missing something to complete their order.  My fries were cold and were returned for a new batch.  For me, if you cant do fries right...its probably going to be downhill from there.  Burgers and chicken were overcooked and under seasoned.  Buns were average and a bit dry.  With all of the options for burgers in the area, will probably not return.",

I'm a sucker for them.  So we hopped on the lunch train and headed here.  Luckily, we were the first people there for lunch, so the wait was not an issue.  From there, annoying things kept popping up.  Annoying thing #1:  You have to tell them that you want the regular burger stuff when you order your burger (onions, lettuce, tomato, etc.).  I'm just so used to that being standard that when my burger arrived without its usual accoutrements, it threw me for a loop.  Annoying thing #2: $12 for a burger, drink, and S.P. fries?  Seems steep.  Annoying thing #3: I asked for a burger sans bun.  They put the burger on the little paper square thing, which would be fine if you aren't eating with a fork.  But you are if you don't have a bun, and then halfway through your burger, you realize you've been eating tiny bits of paper.  Uncool.  I might give it another shot and maybe try the wings, but for burgers and s.p. fries, I'll stick with College Place.",

It was as if the staff was bored and wanted something to do, so they started driving customers away.  I like that you can add a variety of things to your burger, most of which are \"free\" but spending $10 on a burger and fries is too much, even for Uptown prices.  The veggie burger as a previous review wrote, is lacking and is definitely a frozen patty.  Sweet potato fries are good, mac and cheese is mediocre.  The side salad was large and nice, even if it was icky iceberg lettuce.  The milkshakes are good, but again, ehh....   The \"Blazin Hot\" wings are just that... and I like spicy food.... these were TOO hot though.",

I had one of the specialty burgers with jalapenos on it, side of fries, she had a veggie burger with tots. We split a chocolate shake. The tots were the best item out of everything. She said her veggie burger was \"OK.\" My burger was only OK too: while the sauce and toppings were all good, the burger itself was pretty dry and flavorless. The fries were unremarkable but pretty good. We also had to go back up to the counter to get the milkshake, and by then it was partly melted. To me it was more like drinking fully melted ice cream than a shake (it couldn't have started out that great if it was fully melted in less than 5 minutes).  Overall: what's the point of this place when a place like 5 Guys, which is much cheaper, with better food, exists?",

    "text": "So, I've giving 2 stars, because I'd give 1 start for the wait / level of staff courteousness, and 3 stars for the food.  I went to the uptown location with a co-worker, to order some food to go. Because you know, we didn't have the time to stay for half an hour; we had to get back to work. We got there at 12:15, and waited in line for 5 minutes (not bad, it was lunch time uptown; you expect a line). The cashier was so unfriendly, that I felt like I was just bugging her by asking a question (which was about the burger in the kid's meal - to which she only answered that she could not sell me a kid's meal without a child by my side. Too bad; because I wanted a smaller amount of food; smaller fries, and a very small milkshake.) I ordered my food (regular sized), as did my co-worker, at 12:20, and we went over to wait in the holding area, which was full of other people waiting for their food. And we waited, and waited. Every single person in the area was outwardly irritated (we were all in the same boat; had to get back to work!). I heard more than one person lament that their boss would be looking for them, having been told they were just running out to pick up something to go. I watched after 5 minutes as someone made my (regular sized $3.95) milkshake. I knew it was mine, because it was banana and chocolate, and I could see her mix it. Then she set it on the hot counter to wait for my burger to be ready. Well, my burger wasn't ready for another 20 minutes, and then I still had to wait for my co-worker's food (she'd ordered, according to our receipts, less than a minute a part). By the time our food was handed to (more like thrown at) us, my milkshake was totally melted. I mean, liquid. It sloshed when I walked back to my office. (My co-worker's food came almost a full 10 minutes after mine did). Never once did the manager, or any other employee come and apologize for the long wait. And, by that time, I did not have time to ask for another milkshake, as I'd already been gone a while.  The food actually was okay. The hamburger was pretty good (but like the other reviews mentioned, you have to order every topping, even the basics, or you'll get it totally plain, and the staff does NOT tell you this). The fries were okay. And the milkshake; well that might have been good when in its original state.  Being an uptown lunch establishment, you have to be prepared for a lunch crowd (that being said, I would not even say they were THAT busy - the largest crowd was the growing one waiting on to go food. Not every table was even taken). Business eaters often have less time than a casual diner, especially if they are ordering to go. If you can't handle these crowds in a timely manner, then you should move out of uptown, and stick to Southpark, because there are plenty of other places here that CAN handle it.",

But what you're getting for the money. It's just not worth it. If you work in the original Energy Center, the burger from Eurist is a million times better - and so are Eurist's fries. The taste of the meat was clean. I'll give them that. I just felt like I was robbed of over $10 for a burger and a fry. Maybe more if I had opted for the drink. Good lord. It's not that good! The people are always nice - and you can call ahead. This is one of those reviews where I put it to my readers to try it for yourself. Maybe I've lost my mind on this one - I seriously don't think so. I have had gourmet burgers before and spent an arm and a leg.. But I was getting Kobe beef for that or an amazing food experience. I would probably suggest heading up to Valhala for a Norse Burger before I sent you here if you don't know where else to go if you're on foot. If you have your car and an hour + for lunch break, drive to the Burger Co very close by on Morehead (giggity) or Pinky's. You'll be so much more thrilled.",

The staff is friendly but do not go if you're in a hurry.  The first time I went, the wait was incredibly long but for a fresh burger and a new staff, I didn't mind waiting.  The 2nd time, I figured I'd cut some time by ordering online.  I got an error processing my online order which directed me to call in my order number for processing.  The young lady who answered the phone has poor etiquette but it was lunchtime and very busy so I excused that.  She put the manager on the phone and he asked me to give him my order, which meant I couldn't shave as much time off the wait, because I had to wait in line to pay. They appear to have a ton of kitchen staff and 1 cashier and no servers or the servers are hanging out in the kitchen.    I gave it four stars because I love the food and I'm a foodie first.",

The place is fairly small inside with an outside area that looks inviting; you order at the counter, grab a number and wait for the staff to bring your food.   I was trying to be a little healthy, so I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich ($5.35) with sweet potato fries ($2.95).  I ordered the chicken with only honey mustard, and somehow it still tasted bland... and oddly enough, it tasted like lettuce even though there wasn't any on there.  The fries were... eh.  They were a lukewarm and not terribly flavorful.  Service was decent.  The place is sort of like a fancy fast food joint, so I didn't expect much.  They do clear your table, so that was helpful.  The price is good for lunch, but you really do get what you pay for.  I doubt I'll be back anytime soon.",

I ordered a teriyaki chicken sandwich, with fries and an Oreo shake, I expected a chicken patty instead I received two chicken tenders on a bun covered in sauce and the sandwich completely fell apart almost immediately, and tasted very salty and hard. My shake was very thick and could not be drank with a straw. The only saving grace was the fries and so I threw away the sandwich and only ate those. When I expressed my displeasure with the meal to the manager, by the name of Jeffery Kahmorgan he was very offended and accused me of lying, and said that I was only trying to get a free meal. When I expressed that I don't understand why he is taking it personally he proceed to call me a nigger, at which point I was very out rage and me my friend preceded to leave the establishment. I'm very displeased with the food as well as the customer service at this restaurant. I've gone on the website to make a complaint and I'm awaiting a response.  Update: I was never asked to leave I left because of extremely rude management, but as I said before food here is about average, but if your looking for customer service here forget it, as you can see from there response.",

I cought the eye of someone and just kinda started talking loudly. HELLO... I'M HERE TO FOR A PICK UP ORDER. I paid and left.. Walking past a sign showing the Lunch Special (Burger, fries, drink)... Well, I'm a little empty handed. WHERE IS MY DRINK. The young lady that \"assisted\" me at the counter didn't give me one.  So I turn around, walk back in and ask her \"do i get a drink with this..\" (as if i don't know already). OH YEAH... here you go.!!!  WTH!!!! I'm not the smartest, but when you order (or at least i thought) a combo wouldn't you expect to recieve everthing that came along with the combo. Don't you expect ordering a #2 Combo from McDonalds that you would get the fries. or the burger. or the drink.. and not have to go back as if you didn't say the secret \"word\" to rcv your whole purchase.   I know I know I know i'm venting... VENTING... the reason for a 2 star. And i havn't even commented on the food.   The food is ok, Too Little for So MUch $$. My food was cold.. Not sure if i waited too long to pick it up or if it was cold from the begining.   See my pic to see how small the burger is. smh!!",

The problem is that those patties were dry and really pretty bland tasting.  I like the option of half and half O rings and fries as a side choice but the fries are that pseudo-batter dipped kind - think BK fries before the recent change - and the onion rings were clearly frozen out of a bulk package and saved only by a pretty good mustardy dipping sauce.  It's a chain burger place that seems like a chain burger place but doesn't measure up to a good one like 5 Guys.",

With a special event in the area there was a doorman checking ID's. He was friendly and very helpful about events and drinking. When we got inside the line was short and quick. We ordered quickly and were able to sit down.   Food and drinks are good and cheap. They have great drink specials all week. My friend and I decided to try the American Roadside draft. It was exactly the type of beer I like, quite tasty, and only $1.50!  Great deal!  I ordered a hamburger and tater tots and my food came pretty fast. I wasn't too impressed with the burger because it was a little overcooked which is why I'm only giving it four stars.  The tater tots were good and I was able to sample the fries and onion rings since they somehow made their way into my tots. If I make it back I would definitely get the onion rings.  My friend got boneless wings and they were delicious. The sauce was quite warm and left your mouth burning. Everything was a decent price and good.   The restaurant itself was earth friendly. They used a lot of recycled materials to make the tables and chairs as well as the floors and other things in the restaurant.  It has the diner/burger joint feel only maybe a step up.",

    "text": "I had a Groupon that was ready to expire and gathered up some coworkers to head on down and try American Roadside. Most of our group wasn't even aware of it's existence prior to lunch, but I had been meaning to give it a try for a while.   When we got there, I was convinced to give the Roadstar (a quadruple-cheeseburger) a try. I'm not a huge burger toppings person, but I do like a bit of heat and added some chipotle sauce and roasted jalapenos. The burger came with a drink which was nice, and I also grabbed an order of tots and added an order of Cinnabolts (little cinnamon doughnut type things) since I still had a $1 to spend for my Groupon.  I thought my burger was tasty. It wasn't the best burger in town but was about the same quality as a burger from Five Guys. The tots were good and crispy but nothing special (not as good as Bad Daddy's). The one thing our group did notice was that the jalapenos on the burgers actually had some heat, which is pretty rare for a burger topping and we were all impressed. Speaking of heat, another member of our party ordered the hot wings and after dismissing the girl at the counter who said they were \"really hot\", discovered that she wasn't kidding. He managed to eat them all but by the end he was hurting. He said they were the real deal, and next time he would likely split the order and get 5 hot and 5 BBQ.  To sum it up, A.R. is a decent alternative to 5 Guys for a quick relatively cheap burger with the added bonus of have options for the non-burger eaters in your group. Also their house beer was pretty decent for a $2 brew. Everyone in our group agreed that they would give it another shot despite the long walk for us.",

The food was pretty good.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with tater tots.  Everything was delivered to the table hot and fresh and the servings were ample, not overly large just ample.  That's good for me because I tend to be one of those people that will eat it if you put it in front of me no matter the portion!

It was a fantastic mix of beef, mild green chili, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, cheese, chipotle ranch and an onion ring. Hands down, it was one of the best burgers I have had in a long time. I also ordered a side of french fries which were so tasty. They were perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I will definitely be hitting up American Burger Co. on my next trip to Charlotte.

The order online said it would be 10 mins to prepare the salad. I get there at 12:05 and stood at the place where you pick up online orders for 5 mins. The man working behind the counter said you need to get in line with everyone that's ordering if you want your food. This did not make any sense because two people in front me picked up online orders at that particular section of the register. Ok fine i did just what he said. Waited in line another 5 mins and get to the register. I tell the guy I'm here to pick up an order placed  online. He then tells me \"it's not done yet, we will let you know when it's finished.\" I then stood there another 10 mins. Finally i asked the woman working in the kitchen if the order was finished. She said yes \"you need to let us know if you're picking up for an online order\" even though i had already told the two men at the register three times i was there to pick one up. Finally i get the salad after putting the order in 40 mins before i had actually ordered it. The order had been sitting on the counter the entire time but the two guys at the front either didn't care or were too lazy to even check. Co workers and myself frequent this place once a week but after the way the two guys at the front acted i will take my business else where. Also why have a sign that says \"skip the line\" by ordering online if you still have to wait in line?",

Seems like this place is only open for lunch uptown but since this was a special occasion, they were capitalizing on the crowds to support the US of A.  We managed to get the last table available... it was not ideal, but it was out of the heat and humidity of outside and there was a small tv we can make out the game on.  After settling in, went up to order a beer and later some snacks but the staff didn't seem ready for a full house and some of them were confused at times.  Made you wonder if you were going to get the correct beer or even your food (they give you table numbers to place on a stand).    Ordered some onion rings... nothing special here...  The only decent thing about our experience was that the staff kept our table clean and cleared off any empty glasses and asked if we needed refills.",

    "text": "This place wasn't bad. My guy and I tried it for the first time the other day and I was impressed that they had a veggie burger option although I'm pretty sure it was a Morningstar patty I mean it was exactly the same. However the style I had it prepared did some pretty great things for it. I got it prepared \"amigo style\" and I would recommend that for the veggie, burger or turkey patty option it was tasty! Basically American cheese a fried onion ring lettuce tomato guac and spicy ranch. Pretty much hit on my favorite flavors all around. My guy had a build your own burger  with a gluten free bun. He was less impressed with his as he said there just wasn't anything particularly special about it. We both got fries he got regular and I got sweet potato.  Both were good but a little on the under cooked side and this for me is a particular pet peeve I cannot stand fries that aren't super fresh and crispy is preferred.  Now having said that the sweet potato fries come with a cinnamon buttery sort of dipping sauce they make it in house and while it was more than delicious I think it was too sweet for a lunch side item however I'm not a sweets person so for others this may be right up their ally.  I did notice they had a selection of salads as well and if I return I think that's what I would try they seemed just as popular as the burgers upon looking around. They also had a small selection of beers on tap.  Its counter service and they have seating indoors and a patio outside. They seem to get super busy at lunch times with the fact that they are in a busy area uptown but they also seem to be equipped to crank out the food at a pace that you could come in and get out on your lunch break.",

I had a notebook out writing in it, so it was pretty obvious. We were interrupted literally 10 times asking if we wanted refills, if they could take my plate, later his plate, if we wanted more refills, even more refills... all within 45 minutes. It honestly wouldn't have bothered me if it has been even 3-4 times, but it just got to be absurd.   The buffalo chicken sandwich was good. However, my peanut butter cup milkshake was terrible. Let me preface this by saying I am a lover of all things ice cream. However, oddly enough this milkshake didn't even taste like ice cream. It tasted like an odd spin of heavy whipping cream with an odd after taste. The peanut butter cups were not chopped up. There was one huge pb cup stuck in the bottom. I didn't even finish a quarter of it. I don't imagine being back here again. The prices were extremely high for the quality.",

I had the burger with 1000 island dressing and cheese on it; their original burger. It was perfectly juicy but not drippy and medium well.   As this was right before the game the place was packed (KEEP POUNDING) but we still got seats and we got our food really quickly. I could see them making the burgers in the back. It is a good system they have. The burger was definitely one of the best. The only thing to worry about is space. If you are not a football person you don't want to go here on Sundays, Thursday or Monday nights if Panthers have a home game. If you are looking for somewhere to stop by before heading into the stadium, definitely go to American Burger Co. Also use their online ordering system to skip the line. The bottom line is this: This is a quick eat, if you want to sit down somewhere for a while go somewhere a little farther from the stadium. Even so... The food is great.",

    "text": "\"I'm craving a milkshake,\" said the bf. \"Yelp says American Roadside has milkshakes. We can walk there,\" said newbie yelp fanatic.  It was freezing outside so we bundled up and got to walking. I felt like a popsicle by the time we got there.  \"Hi, I'd like one of your hand scooped Oreo milkshakes,\" he said excitedly.  \"Our machine is broken,\" said the cashier with a dead look in her eyes. She was so blah that I swear she could've passed for a zombie.  \"Oh no! We walked all the way here just for the milkshake!\" I said whiningly like a child but, nonetheless, slightly laughing because it was kind of comical since we braved the 40 degree weather to walk here.  \"It's broken,\" said the cashier. I bet she didn't even have a pulse.  \"Oookay :( Um, I guess I'll have a...\"  So that's how our experience started at American Roadside. The cashier's lack of concern was a bit annoying. There was no apology at all, not even a fake one that she should have been trained to do. If she would've at least smiled and faked an apology, it honestly would've smoothed things over. I've had more than my share of customer service jobs. An apology, canned or sincere, is standard.   She then proceeded to get irritated that we didn't know what toppings came on the hamburger and hot dog. Each second that we were in front of her, seemed to bring her pain.  I understand that people have bad days. She was definitely having one of them.  I ordered a hamburger ($3.95) and the bf ordered a hot dog ($3.95) and tater tots ($1.95). Although they were both good, they were really small, almost as if they were intended for kids. Any average person would still be hungry after eating them, unlike Five Guys (yeah, yeah, I know it's a chain, but I still think it's good!) where you are filled up after eating a burger by itself.   I'm sure that not all the cashiers are bad here but her attitude left a bad taste in my mouth. I doubt we'll be back.",

    "text": "Okay, so the thing is, you have to eat at this place with the right mindset. I see a lot of people hating on American Roadside and judging it as if they've been personally insulted. It's the equivalent of a diner, so you're not going to get your burger medium rare and don't expect it to taste like a filet. It's also not a quick service restaurant, so don't expect fast food speed. It's fast casual and I think it does a good job.  For ~$6 - $7, you can make your burger the greatest burger on this planet. They've brought the customization right to the customer... isnt' that what we all want? You can choose from a myriad of toppings and sauces so I don't see what the fuss is about. OMG you have to CHOOSE??? all that work? yes, deal with it.  Milshakes.. .simply amazing. Oreo for me. Probably the most \"unreasonably\" priced thing on their menu (like $4), but also quite possibly the most delicious. They make each shake by hand and it's a good portion for normal-sized people. It's not too thick (eating with a spoon), nor does it feel liquidy or watered down. Classic.  If you're not interested in burgers, they also have chicken burgers (Fried or grilled), chicken tenders, hot dogs, wings, and best of alll...TATER TOTS. Seriously a delicious lunch if you're looking for food that makes you feel good.  Healthy? no, it isn't. So you might as well go all out if you come here. Don't be someone who asks:  \"hmm could i have a double bacon cheeseburger..oh but only one slice of cheese... tryna watch my figure!\"  Seriously, enjoy your time here and binge. Have a beer. That's what this place is here for. It may be a prime example of why America is overweight, but as they say... \"everything in moderation\"  4/5",

The location is has nice decor inside but an odd glass wall in front of the entrances.  When you give the order and pay, you just grab a seat and wait with the number up; the staff was generally very nice and quickly fetched things I forgot, like a straw.  I ordered a Carolina style Burger (this is similar to the Roadside Rally, except I built my own with Mustard, Onions, Slaw, and Chili) with tater tots and a chocolate milk shake; I also got water, which they give you a small clear plastic cup.  The wait time is average.  The meal arrives and its a tad underwhelming; the burger looks cute in its burger diaper and I had exactly two dozen tater tots... I kind of expected more from what I paid for; so its surprisingly more expensive than Five Guys.    One pet peeve , after I order a burger, the lady asked if I want cheese with that.  Cheese didn't slip my mind, I didn't want cheese, thus I didn't mention it.  I know they are trying to up-sale here, but it annoys me.  Taste wise, the tater tots were so-so, despite being slightly over cooked and a tad salty.  The chocolate milk shake was good, but I have gotten more from other Burger places (i.e. Burger 21 and Bad Daddy's).  Sadly, the burger was a major disappointment, considering it is a burger restaurant.  The burger was tough and salty, the bun was equally tough.  The condiments that came with it had nearly no flavor whatsoever; only making my burger diaper bulge the other end after a couple of bites.  I sadly could not finish the burger, it simply was not good.  Overall, I give this one star because this is a major fail for a burger restaurant serving an overpriced sub-par burger... their is no excuse.  Their are better burger places nearby; American Roadside should be avoided.",

My Eye caught the American burger company sign and we decided to stop in. The menu Is fairly eclectic with a good selection of burgers, chicken and salads. Something for most tastes.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. The selections are ala carts so just be ready for that if you want fries and a drink. I opted for the Pretzel Cheddar Burger and my daughter got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. We each got fries and a drink as well.  Burgers are cooked to order so we took a seat after ordering at the counter. Service was quick and again, friendly.  My daughters chicken sandwich was crisp and topped with the right amount of hot sauce.  Delicious.   The pretzel roll for my burger was perfect. It was soft enough to take easy bites out of the burger without the insides squirting out all over the place. The burger like to be 1/3 pounder, very substantial and cooked very well.  The burger was delicious, meaty and juicy. Our fries were thin and plentiful. Again, fries aren't something to crow about but they were good and they gave us a Tom with our sandwiches.  I'm surprised by the 3/5 reviews on Yelp. This place was definitely a 4/5 when we went.",

Built up rings of some unidentifiable substance on which they place my dinner! If I had to guess it was spilled wine. Not a real big deal. As I was eating, the cashier was diligently wiping down the rest of the bar.   Good thing I'm here by myself as talking or carrying on a conversation would be impossible with the volume of the music! An aside ad for Bose 30 A noise canceling headphones! $300 and they work well!  Pre-processed onion rings to maximize efficiency and profitability; welcome to the 2020s but were hot and pretty good! The food came in a very reasonable and timely fashion. Burger is actually pretty good! Sloppy, good taste, great thousand island dressing!   The staff was smiling and friendly and appeared to give a damn which is more than I can say for Haymaker. Came in with not great expectations but will probably come back again with some hand sanitizer and a paper towel. So it's 625 on a Thursday holiday weekend evening and I am the ONLY person in here!! Makes me look for the sanitation score!I think the staff really cares! Sanitation score was 97.5 the highest on the street!! I stand humbly corrected! Someone just walked in; I just might recommend this place!",

    "text": "First impressions are everything. We stumbled upon this restaurant on our way to the panthers game. They seemed to be very busy, which to us was a good sign.   It's kinda like McDonalds where you walk up to the counter and place your order. Then find a seat somewhere in the restaurant and they will bring you your order.   We order 2 hamburgers, 1 with American cheese and the other with provolone, a chili cheese dog, and a large order of tots. Total was a little over $20. Which seemed pretty fair. They however, didn't give us a receipt, but gave us our number for the table. Inside was over crowded and warm from all of the bodies. So we seated ourselves outside. When our order came, we were only given the hotdog, tots and one hamburger which had both types of cheese on them. Which was not what we ordered. We told the young man we were missing a hamburger and that the other burger was incorrect but we would keep it. The young man went to go check on the missing burger and came back asking for our receipt, which we were not given. So we had no way to dispute the mistake. So we had to pay for ANOTHER burger. So overall I think this issue could have been handled differently, I understand mistakes happen, but we shouldn't have been asked to repay for their mistake.   Lastly, the burgers were not that impressive. They lacked flavor, and they were extremely greasy. The bottom bun was saturated in grease and burger juices. The tots were also heavily greasy and had no flavor, felt like I was biting into a glob of oil. Gross.   If we are ever back in Charlotte for a Panthers game, I know we won't be going back to this place. We were better off going to Burger King or McDonalds for the quality and service we got.",

When I say quick eats it was we were in a massive rush just before the game started however didn't want to pay exorbitant stadium pricing on a Sunday afternoon. So ordered a cheese burger and fries and was pleasantly satisfied. We wolfed down the burger in the restaurant and it was tasty juicy and of above average quality. The fries we decided to eat on the walk down to the stadium. Overall it was much better value than What we would have paid at BOA stadium. Would I return back, sure.  ****** convenience factor five stars.",

The 2nd time I went I ordered the same thing with sweet potato fries. The fries were prepared well but, lack any real flavor - however the cinnamon butter that comes with the sweet potato fries makes them very tasty.",

    "text": "My family and I are visiting this weekend, and since this restaurant was close we decided to try it. We knew the ratings were a bit low, and we decided to make our own experience. My goal was to be able to give this place 5 stars in an effort to increase their 3 star ratings. When we arrived, we were immediately told the food would take about 25 minutes. NOTE: They close at 7pm on Friday's and Saturday's. They were happy to serve us even though we arrived at 6:45. Everything started out great! The staff was super nice, and also allowed my husband to modify the Roadstar burger due to dietary needs and still do the challenge for a t-shirt. This was very nice and accommodating even though they originally said \"no.\" We asked to speak to the mgr about it, and he approved it. We sat down and waited for our food which did come out faster than expected. They gave our kids some extra French fries which was also nice. When my burger came out it was incorrect. We did not have a receipt because it is a Square type check out and my husband didn't opt for one. However, they quickly took it back and made all corrections. The burger was good. It wasn't one to \"write home about\" yet it was still good. My husband's burger was actually missing a few of the toppings. We chose not to say anything since they were clearly closed. They did give him a shirt for finishing his burger. The part that got us is that the kids meals come with free ice cream. We made it clear that our kids would want ice cream. When they went in to get it, they had already cleaned out the ice cream machine. Honestly, they may have simply forgotten. I do feel that we made it clear enough to where someone could have come and asked if they were ready for it since they were about to clean it out. We would have been fine with that. Again, may have been an honest mistake, and it was disappointing. As much as I really wanted to give them 5 stars, it wasn't worth 5 stars. The food is ok. I can't say we would come back when in town.",

This location gave the driver the wrong meal. When I called to place a complaint bc I had a specific taste for this the manager commenced to blame the driver as if the food isn't given to the driver once they pay for it. This lack of accountability is disgraceful. Then going to say if I can get postmate to send someone else back out they have no problem re-doing it. Very disappointed. He could of offered a gift card for an error they clearly played a role in. And to top it off when I tried to replace the order the system would not let me. Now if this was a postmate glitch I can't verify but they definitely dropped the ball of giving the delivery driver the wrong food. We had 5 meals the one they gave was 1.",
