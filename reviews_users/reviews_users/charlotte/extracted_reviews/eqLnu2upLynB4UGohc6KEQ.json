We went for a Saturday afternoon lunch.  The sweet tea is VERY sweet, asked for half a glass of ice water.  I had the Southwest Chicken Salad, others had the Manhattan Pizza. My salad was fresh and flavorful. The personal pizza was excellent as well.  They also have NTN trivia if you like playing on-line.  This place probably rocks during hoops season and should be a destination once the 49'ers start their football season.  They have a hugh projection screen TV and all the requisite HD Plasamas",

The really attentive waiter I think was the manager and he was cooking, taking orders, serving, and cleaning up but had a casual attitude like he really enjoyed the crowd.  EVERY one treated him like family. The burger I ate was exceptional and I expected bar food. There is a nice variety of dishes like a restaurant should have but also simple things like pizza, appetizers, and wings. Drinks were simple it seems but I had a soda, I don't drink. I went to check out the loudness which was only loud during touchdown and it was college bowl games. Very nice customers and they were some of the regular crowd so they seemed to genuinely care about the manager and the waitress and each other. There were two families with young children sitting down on the bottom area and one couple had a baby and seems like the crowd got a little quieter. But still there were touchdowns! Overall enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.",

    "text": "I have been eating and playing poker at Picasso's for over a year now . . . and at the Uptown location for longer than that. I should say that I'm not a sports fan . . . I come here to play poker and spend time with my poker buddies a couple of nights a week. BUT, for those who are sports fans and like to eat/drink while watching a game,  you should be very happy with this place. Picasso's is very popular with the college-aged sports fan crowd -- particularly since it's located just up the road from UNC-Charlotte. The food is standard sports-bar fare. Wings, pizzas, sandwiches, wraps, fries and other appetizers. These are of fairly average quality -- though I have heard some of my friends comment that they particularly like the fajitas. There are no desserts. There is a good selection of beer & mixed drinks -- nothing fancy, but adequate and fairly priced for your average sports fan. The staff is very friendly and professional and are able to accomodate large crowds with ease -- given a little advanced notice. As I mentioned, my poker league plays here twice a week (on Mondays and Wednesdays, 2 games each day at 7pm and 9:30pm FREE) and we usually have crowd of 20-30. Often, other college groups (clubs, fraternities, sports teams, etc.) share the same space.  It's a spacious establishments with lots of TVs and even a huge (I'd say 10 ft or bigger) projection TV for the big games.  In addition to the games on the TVs and twice-weekly free poker, there is also an electronic darts board and a \"shuffleboard\" game. The covered outdoor seating area is convenient if you happen to be a smoker or have smokers in your party.   SO . . . being a foodie, I'd give Picasso's 3 stars. Since this place is a SPORTS BAR, however, and judging it on its' own merits, I'll give Picasso's 4 stars!",

They have the same good food we had enjoyed in Cornelius, a good beer selection, an attractive-enough layout, and friendly staff.",

The service at Picasso's is good, but it's not A) a family restaurant, B) a frozen drink/flair/appletini bar, or C) a 'College' bar.  It's a sports bar, so tip well, enjoy the food, and get ready for the bartenders to know your name and your drink the next time you come in.",

None the less we found seats close to the big screen. It seems like there's thousands of tv's in this place! I think there were only two servers working that day. But they had it all under control. It's kind of a do as you please atmosphere. Everyone had on a jersey representing their team, it was live! I ordered the two foods their known for. Pizza. Wings. I had a medium cheese pie and the cajun garlic wing basket (or whatever it's called). The pizza, not really all that great. It was just a step up, maybe two, from frozen pizza. ( Our waitress noted that the dough is made in house dailey). Just didn't hit the spot for me. The wings on the other hand...marvelous! I don't know if I'd say the best in Charlotte, but they were pretty good! Sadly when I got to the bottom of my wing baskey ( because I ate all of them), my very last wing had a rather large feather still attached. This rendered it inedible in my book. Overall great spot. I'll be going back for sure.",

It is a great place to watch whatever game you want because they have tons of TVs as well as the largest projection TV I have seen thus far in Charlotte.  I have only tried the wings and the pizza and they are definitely on point.  The pizza is oven baked, so it has a unique taste that only Picasso's can provide.  I would give it five stars if the service was a little more consistent.  Sometimes you will sit down at a table and it takes forever for someone to come over, while at other times the service is stellar.  If you are looking for awesome pizza or wings in the University area, this is your spot.",

He made a special trip to our table to declare the server was correct in her statement and her action because she was requested to stick her finger in the food in question.  Really?

Luckily we both had cash on us so we just left it on the table.  Service aside, we didn't eat any food so I may come back here to try that out - maybe not on a football night.  There are plenty of screens and TVs all around the Bar and dining area so everyone had a decent view of the screens - I could see it as a fun place to go and watch games.  I think my friends and I just wanted to check in on the score, but didn't think the bar was going to be so charged up.  There were some die-hard Giants and Cowboys fans in there.  We left during the half since it felt like a fight was going to break out at any second.  I'm pretty sure nothing happened, but it was a lot of people yelling at each other - maybe we got there late that we didn't realize all those people were friends and were just making fun of each other...",

    "text": "He said: It was good to find a place near the hotel to kill some time waiting for check-in.  We had read the pepperoni roll \"was to die for\", but decided that was a little over-stated, for sure.  It was tasty and satisfying, but if I came back I wouldn't feel like I had to get it again.  We requested the onion rings extra crispy and instead got them cooked the standard way.  Other than those minor bumps, our waitress was great (I would call her out by name if I could, but she deserved the tip we gave), the food was satisfactory, and having NoDa on tap was a major plus.  All in all, deserving the 3 stars.  She said: We were hungry, and this was nearby. The tap selection wasn't fantastic, but that didn't matter because the NoDa Hop, Drop, and Roll was on tap and that's all that I needed. We had my youngest with me, and he's @BurgerPursuit on Twitter (a boy in search of the perfect burger), so he had a burger and found it to be acceptable. Our waitress made the visit more than pleasant with her charm, and the food was satisfactory. Not great, but not bad at all. We sat outside because the dog was with us, so I can't comment on the interior ambiance.  Potty Points: It was a serviceable bathroom. Not pristine, but not awful. I'll give it three out of five potty points.",

    "text": "Recently went here with my boyfriend. We couldn't decide whether to get pizza or wings, so we got both! Ordered a medium house pizza and 12 wings (6 BBQ Pineapple Kicker & 6 Honey Chipotle). Both were delicious! The pizza crust and sauce were clearly house made and perfectly cooked (I like my pizza a little doughy so if you prefer yours a little crispier you might want to request this). The wings were also exactly what I wanted: crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The honey chipotle was both of our favorites, the bbq pineapple kicker was just ok (still polished all of them off though).   In terms of ambiance it is most definitely a sports bar, so if you're not into being surrounded by TVs and beer then I probably wouldn't recommend this place for you. Service was good, although I would imagine on game days it might be a little more hectic.  All in all it was exactly what we were looking for. We will definitely be going back again soon!",

    "text": "Ok, I admit, I am not a sports bar person.  Heck, I am not so much of a sports person.  But I am a huge fan of wings, and thus I sought out a place that had pretty decent ones.  This led me to try Picasso's to see what it's all about.  And I have got to say, they have some pretty good ones.  Thus far, I have tried three different kinds.  The Caribbean Creepers were like eating a jerk chicken wing, but they were just a little too different for me.  The medium garlic were pretty good, but the best I have had, by far, are the Cajun Garlic.  They are the perfect level of spiciness, not too spicy but plenty of flavor.    I have tried some of their other things here too.  Their bacon cheese fries were kind of 'meh' when I had them; they were pretty skimpy on the cheese and bacon.  Their pizza was pretty decent.  We had the Masterpiece, had a lot of good toppings.  Still, I am not a huge fan of New York-style pizza (I originate from the Midwest, and am quite partial toward Chicago-style or deep dish), but it was pretty standard for pizza.  Service has been ok here.  I have never had bad service, so that is definitely a plus.  They do have a decent amount of seating too, and it's not overly crowded in there.  I plan to try a few more things on their menu, and that definitely includes other styles of their wings.  Their wings are good, but I must continue on my quest for amazing wings here in Charlotte.  Overall, I would give Picasso's about 3.5 stars.",

It was typical of sports type bars with sports on every TV, but was more laid back with country music playing at a level that still allowed for conversation without having to yell. It was also very clean; tables weren't sticky or anything like that. Also the staff and patrons all seemed very polite and courteous; nothing loud or obnoxious.  Our server Finley was amazing. He was well versed in the menu items, as well as local beers. He did a great job at recommending items for us to try, and was very attentive. The food was great. Per Finley, everything is homemade but the cheese, and it tasted that way. Nothing tasted out of the box or can - it was all very fresh. We had the spinach & artichoke dip, Caribbean wings, and a veggie pizza (see images). All were great. Would highly recommend especially for late night dinners.",

    "text": "Really pleasantly surprised. Truly, 3.5 stars but it didn't seem fair to round down to 3 stars.  Short version: Its a sports bar that offers friendly service, good portions and good food. Good for hanging out to watch the games or just a super casual meal. Note: IDs are checked on Sundays; must be 21 and over.  Long version: Hubs and I walked in late afternoon during a football game. Vibe was a bit divey and I expected the worst. I comforted myself by reminding myself of all their good reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. Once we seated ourselves, we were taken care off rather quickly and everyone that came to the table was really friendly and checked on us often. We ordered medium garlic wings and tater tots to start. The wings were great! Really crispy with just enough sauce. The tots were perfectly crisp without being greasy or soggy in the inside. For entrees, we had the bacon mushroom swiss burger (no swiss) with veggie medley for myself, and classic burger with fries for the hubs. Both burger were over cooked and, were nothing to write home about, but by no means bad. They were just ok. The veggie medley was just your standard normandy blend with a sprinkle of salt and pepper over top. The fries were ok. Not the best, not the worst.  Overall, its sports bar food that doesn't necessarily excite (except for the wings and tots) but doesn't disappoint either.  Will definitely return to try some other items and report back.",

I realized, at that point, that 80's music was extremely tame and innocent compared to the tripe on the radio today. Where's the \"Walking on Sunshine\"? Where's the \"Faith\" (not  Limp Bizkit style)? Where's Elizabeth Shue and her \"Cruel Summer\"? Where's the \"Billie Jean\" for cryin out loud (actually, that one is a bit filthy for 80's innocence)? Nice place to catch a game and some cold beers.",

    "text": "I don't tend to go to sports bars, so I've passed by Picasso's for years - if I go to a restaurant, I'm looking for good food, not to catch a game.  But I'd always heard good things so I finally stopped in a few weeks ago looking for a place still serving food after 10pm.  So I was expecting standard bar fare, competently prepared, which they came through on.  What I didn't expect was the staff regulars going around regularly checking on everyone and genuinely seeming to care about their experience. And then the food came out - I ordered a mushroom & swiss burger and a salad - hardly original - but realized as I ate that EVERYTHING was fresh -every last little lettuce leaf - the burger was fresh and perfectly prepared as i'd ordered it.  I've been back several times since and had the wings, and their cheese steak.  Each time it has been the same - fresh-tasting food, perfect preparation.  So what i would normally consider a \"standard\" sports bar with \"standard\" bar fare (not a bad thing) has turned into an extraordinary experience because of this consistent delivery on quality.  I haven't even tried their pizza and pizza rolls yet which they are known for and which they keep recommending.  You can bet I'll be back for that!  Kudos to the management and staff at Picasso's!",

They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.  I recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  This is a tasty sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  The wings were brought to me pipping hot and the ranch was thick and cold.  There's nothing I despise more than a warm, runny ranch.  The wings were cooked with the perfect amount of crispiness but were not overcooked by any means.    My only complaint with the wings is that they are not charred.  I'm sorry to say, but if you're not throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.  If your looking for a chill and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite team, Picassos is the perfect place.  On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing short of perfectly organized mayhem.  Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't kick-off until 1pm!  Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage.   Before I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  I give Picasso's Sports Cafe as a whole  5-stars.  The staff is always friendly, prompt and efficient.  However, I am not giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  Though their wings are good, there are not \"5-star\" worthy.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a 7.  At its soul, this is a classic, American sports-bar.  Good food, done right.",

Since it is a sports bar they were playing music trivia, so it was nice to listen to the retro and even songs I never heard of. They have a decent amount of beers and local beers on draft. We didn't want to order a pizza or sandwich's so we ordered a couple of small dishes. First we ordered chicken nachos which were pretty good, however nothing out of this world. Next we ordered honey Bbq wings, which were crispy and oh so juicy. Finally my favourite thing to order on the menu is the philly pizza roll! Man this thing is like a tiny pizza and the dough is just amazing. We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere of a sports bar. I will say that we went to eat around 8:30 and they had a bouncer checking IDs which was a little weird and early since the place was not packed.  Check this place out it's worth it!",

We can sit anywhere.  I ordered the cheesesteak sandwich on lettuce w/o bun. And a steam veggie side. The cheesesteak touch the spot. Steam veggie is typical. Nothing special.. Our waiter check on us often and place is not crowded. So we were in and out!  Hoping to try it again for dinner sometimes during football season!",

I've now lived here for a couple years, and Picasso's is still my go-to sports bar.  A few things:  - the food is consistently good (typical orders for us are wings, burgers, or pizza, but have actually never ordered anything we didn't like) - they always have drink specials (and actually good drink specials that I feel happy to order) - the service is always stellar (even though I am frequently here with groups of people, which probably makes us especially difficult to wait on)  The atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect in a sports bar - lots of TVs with the game, adequate seating, a small outdoor area. They also have a few events several times a week (karaoke, trivia, etc). I highly recommend!",

It's cheap, fast, tasty, and the drink specials are on point.  This is your typical dark, come as you are sports bar. If that's your jam, you won't find better.  The kitchen is open and they clearly take great pride-someone is ALWAYS cleaning. It's nice to watch them work and know that they are caring for what goes in my belly more than I probably do at home.  Lastly, this is a diverse crowd, which is a great reflection of our city and the area. Lots of great 49ers stuff on the walls, but some NY flavor going on as well.  Picasso's is Charlotte. :)",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a neighborhood sports bar in the University area of Charlotte, Picasso's Sports Cafe. This wings and pizza sports bar also features sandwiches, salads, and a list of starters.  Dora here. Tucked into the bottom floor of a ginormous shopping center, we almost missed this place. So glad we didn't because it reminded me of a modern \"Cheers.\" We appreciated that it wasn't dark and stale like some sports bars and offered plenty of tables near the windows. With televisions of all sizes, this cafe would be a great place to catch a game, especially if you get there early like us. lol.  As our starter, we chose the Breadstix with homemade dough, topped with mozzarella and cheddar cheese, garlic butter and served with a side of marinara. This appetizer was great, kind of like a cheese pizza with outstanding dough. Dora here. Yum. Who can complain about a buttery crust and two kinds of cheese? Not me!  For my lunch, I ordered the Wing & Fry Basket, which included 6 garlic parmesan wings and tater tots. The buffalo sauce mixed in with the garlic and parmesan gave the wings quite the kick, really good flavor. The tater tots were crispy, just how I like them.  Dora here. The pepperoni roll was a good balance if you're craving something pizza-ish, not overly doughy or cheesy. But, unless you're really hungry, you might want to share this jumbo roll. Especially if you order the Breadstix appetizer...carb overload. Don't judge! lol.

This time I tried the Pineapple Kicker Wings. I was thinking they would be a little more sweeter with the name \"Pineapple\" and all, instead they are more on the spicer side. The bf had Hot Garlic. They too were on the spicer side instead of really tasting the garlic. All in all the wings were still good and now you can get a basket which comes with six wings and a nice size helping of French Fries for $7.99. Before you would have had to add a side of fries. They also have really good drink specials: $2.50 draft beers and $9.00 pitchers. The appetizers of my choice is the Spinach Artichoke Dip and the Pepperoni Pizza Rolls...I wouldn't recommend the  Fried Jalapeno  b/c when I had them they were kinda mushy and I actually prefer them with cream cheese instead of a nacho cheese filling. Looking for a place with great wings and specials on drinks then head over here...also a great place for sport fan fanatics!",

They do have live music intermittently on weekends, but it is much more a sports bar than live music venue.  My band performed there in May, during the NBA Finals. We were slated to go on at 10, after the first game but before the second game came on, which meant they would turn down the sound on the TVs. I thought we were going to get bum-rushed when some people learned what was going on.   It turned out okay in the end, but it was an interesting evening to say the least.  Food-wise, the pizza and wings are delicious! I had excessive quantities of both, as well as draft beer.  Apart from the sports crowd, it seems this place does quite a bit of late-night business, as a lot of people make it one of their last stops of the evening before heading home to sleep it off.  Overall, a good scene, and definitely worth a stop just for the pizza and wingies.",

The waiter was super nice and the free shuffle board like game was alot of fun. However after I ordered, all these good things dissolved away like the flavor of gum once you've chewed for 5 minutes. Two of the TVs directly facing us ended up being SD instead of HD, which was not the worst thing by far, but really grinded my gears . I knew I had to wait longer for my food because of the group I was with, but I literally ordered a burger on a piece of bread and chips (patty melt). When it came out it was missing cheese and had 1 onion slice. The bread was untoasted and unbuttered and unsatisfying. The burger was well-to-burnt, dry and also unsatisfying. The chips were very good and the water was also unsatisfying, probably because of how terrible the experience was. I can't believe I paid 9.45 for a burger and bread, the simplest thing on the menu, and they managed to mess that up. Not only did they mess it up, but the management took an hour and a half of my life to do so. Seemed like a cool place, but it was overpriced, understaffed and under my expectations.
