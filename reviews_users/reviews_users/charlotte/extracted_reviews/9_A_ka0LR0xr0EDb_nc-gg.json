I've ordered from here since we moved to Matthews in 2005. I've taken my extended family here when they visit ,weve gone on weekdays when sports left us little time for home cooked meals and also on weekends with my kids and their friends. But never again. Ive never in my life ( nor have my close girlfriends , whom I've asked) have I experienced what I did tonight. When I arrived tonight and asked for my order I was tokd it had been cancelled. I asked if they were joking as I thought it was a joke.A behind the counter then stated that they called my number and had spoke with \"a guy\" who answered and replied \"it was ok\".  (My phone never rang and with me at all times. I checked. No calls. No VM.) Initially trying to decipher whether this was a joke or not a female employee nearby must of heard my confusion because she came over and further explained to me that my order had come in a few minutes before closing and therefore tgey cancelled it.I then asked about the money since my card had been ran and was told the transaction would not complete since my order had been cancelled. I will be waiting 3-7 days for it to fall off. I drove all the way there only to find out my order was cancelled even though it was placed before they closed.  As a former Pizza restaurant mg I am thoroughly confused and find this bad customer service to boot. As a customer I'm upset and hungry is my family!!!",

If your kids want to see what it looks like to spin pizza dough in the air and then eat what they have just watched being made, try Tony's pizza.  This is outstanding thin crust pizza!  They do not skimp on toppings and their other offerings are just as good - spaghetti, calzone, wings, just awesome food and lots of it.  We always leave with extra.",

You will not be disappointed when you eat here. You can tell it's good when you just from the outside because it doesn't have a cartoon character advertising it (Jets, Hungry Howies...) and you can see what the slices look like before you order.  I cant say what anything else tastes like here, this is a pizza place, if you order anything other than pizza you are taking chances.",

Thin and greasy pizza has never really had any flavor besides what I just listed. I do like their chicken, lettuce & mayo sandwich though. And their garlic rolls are good too. I would go back.",

She has 2 young boys and this satisfies them, and us at the same time.    This week we switched it up and went last night.  She ordered 2 cheese pies and 2 salads to eat in and by the time we got there it was almost done.  For 5 adults and 2 kids we ended up eating all of it and everyone left full and happy.  I do think this is the most authentic NY style pizza place I've tried in Charlotte.  More often than not, the pizza comes out nice and thin with a great crispness to it, and a nice crust.  Last night it was perfect.  Other times it can be a bit soggy but luckily the ingredients taste good so its not a big deal.  Also, Friday nights and Sunday nights are like going to two different restaurants.  While Friday's are packed, Sunday had us and maybe 2 other tables.",

    "text": "We visited Tony's Pizza the other night for the first time.  You order at the counter and then seat yourself in their very large dining room and go pick up your order when it's ready.  Then you throw out your own trash and nobody cleans off the tables.  Why they have a tip jar and a spot for tips on their receipts is anyone's guess.  Seriously?    Anyway, enough about my rant on thinking you deserve a tip for not doing any actual \"serving\" or \"bussing.\"  We ordered a large pizza (19\", I think?) for the kids, a stromboli, and a calzone.  What's the difference between a stromboli and a calzone, you ask?  A stromboli seems to be just like a pizza on the inside of a crusty pocket.  A calzone also comes in a crusty pocket, but doesn't have sauce inside (only on the side for dipping) and ricotta cheese.    The pizza was humongous.  Each slice was this massive mini-pizza all by itself.   I sampled the pizza--it was pretty good.  Thin crust with some crisp on the bottom, and it also had just the right amount of cheese and sauce.  No skimping here.  The stromboli and calzone were huge, too, and both tasted fantastic.  They each made for two meals. They make good dough/crust at Tony's Pizza, and the fillings were amazing, too.  It's too bad they don't have more of a variety for strombolis and calzones.  There's one of each.    We also tried the Fried Zucchini appetizer because I had heard from friends that they were good.  They were just okay.  A lot of batter and not much flavor/spices.  For the price and taste, I wouldn't get them again.  The atmosphere was very cafeteria-like, but since there's a LOT of seating, you can spread out throughout the dining room.  Would we return to Tony's?  You bet!  Great pizza and pizza-like products at great prices.  Just don't expect me to tip when you never leave your spot behind the counter.",

They make it fresh - always fun to watch your pizza crust being tossed in the air :)  It does take a little bit of time to make it fresh so don't go here if you are in a hurry!  We got a 15 incher and it was pretty huge.  Naturally, I ate my half with no problem - decided to go with mushrooms and sausage.  I would call it a winning combo.  My buddy was not eating meat at the time so he went with tomatoes and green peppers.... not as fun as the meat and mushrooms, but luckily they are able to split the pizza with toppings so there's no arguing for 30min over what topping should be on the pizza.  Crust was great and the ingredients tasted good too... be ready to fold your pizza over and scarf it down NY style!",

They've got the monster, triangle slices that beg you to fold them in half before crushing it like your last meal.  The mushrooms are grey (not black, bleh), and the meatballs are also noteworthy.    The restaurant itself is a bit of a dive, but my guess is that 90% of patrons are there for take-out.    The largest pizza is huge, be warned.  If you order it, it over-fills the box and folds up some of the crusts on the outside just to fit in.  I'm not complaining about having more of this 'za, however - it's gooood.",

Being in NC, and advertising as many do 'True NY Pizza', they as every other in the area boasting True NY pizza are setting the bar high.  Bottom line is, as most know, your not going to get True NY Style Pizza/Bagles etc, without NY water.  Sounds crazy, that the key lies in water from NY, not water from the pristine south, but if you know food, you know this to be True.  With that said, Tony's has got a great Pizza. If you like NY style pizza, Tony's comes close, you wont be disappointed.  Large pies, large slices with the 19inch and they have a 25incher that would feed a large group (the 19 each will easily satisfy 3-5 hearty eaters easily), good stuff.  Have tried their lasagna, ziti, subs, calzones etc, and I would call them all average. Not bad, but not anything you will run home and tell your neighbors about.  With Tony's, the pizza is where its at. Their signature item, imo.  Folks at the galleria location are typically very friendly, whether slow or busy (normally they are pretty busy at peak lunch/dinner hours, but again, nice, friendly and courteous...call ahead, it'll be ready when you arrive)...  I normally go for the 19inch for my family, but if your on the go, wanting lunch, they have lunch specials normally 2 giant slices, drink and etc, with no wait time.  They also have a 10inch pie reasonably priced that will satisfy 2 hungry lunch goers....",

It's a little more expensive for an Italian dinner (than some of their other items- right around $10), but it comes with a huge amount (& is always better the next day), plus a salad which although medium sized-rocks! It's Italian style with olives and banana peppers, but also fresh shaved Parmesan cheese which makes it, and is surprisingly mostly goodies instead of lettuce. Dinners also come with fresh baked bread- can't beat it for the price, or the good service. The pizza is thin style crust (NY) but they're HUGE, one piece fills me up and is only $2 or $3 I think. It's self service once you get past the counter but both locales have a wonderful dining room with plenty of space for busy evenings to chill out and eat in. One of my regular favorites!!!",

Apart from that, it was completely average - nothing special in flavor, and run of the mill topping options. It was ok, but unless I'm in need of a giant pizza, I'd probably look elsewhere if I'm going out for pizza. My idea of a five-star pizza place is one where you look at the options and say, \"Wow, I never would have thought of that combo, but that looks amazing.\" (Like Andouille sausage, candied jalapenos, dollops of cream cheese and honey. Or blueberry, arugala, chevre, and crispy prosciutto with fresh mozzarella - best pizza ever to date. If you're ever in Tallahassee, FL check out Midtown Pies!) Anyone can make pizza. To excel, you have to venture off the beaten path.",

As far as I'm concerned this is one of the 3 best places for pizza in Charlotte, with the other 2 being Luisa's near Park Rd. shopping center and Portifino's at the Arboretum.  The atmosphere here is okay, nothing to write home about, no romantic dates here, but the pizza makes up for that.

Tony's makes a pretty good pizza.  There's not much to it but the tip is typically crispy which is essential.  The sauce is decent..not my favorite but not ragu so we're good.  The crust is a little slim so I wish it was slightly thicker and crispier but I'll let that slide.  The meatballs are done well.  They are fresh and they have good flavor.  They are soft/tender, not chewy.  Meatball parm is pretty yummy.  Overall this place is decent.  If you're in the neighborhood it is worth stopping in for a slice of pizza.",

I have had better pizza, but it does the trick if you are hungry.  The crust is too crunchy for my taste and the pieces too thin.  I also prefer more of a thick, marinara sauce instead of their thin, very tomato-y sauce.  A lot of people may prefer it Tony's way, though.  The service is good and there never is much of a wait.  They get through a crowd quickly, which is nice if you're in a hurry.  The prices are decent.",

I always get nervous doing this because I worry they do exactly what this location did: as soon as they get the order, they make it, and it sits until the time I pick it up. I came in a few minutes before my pickup time and they give me my order directly. It was clear the pizza I ordered had been sitting there for at least 5-10 minutes at least. When I got it I could tell it was like warm at best but my son was ready to eat so I was not going delay dinner anymore. Then after my 20 minute drive home, the pizza was pretty much ice cold and bread was burnt and barely edible. I feel like this location is only good for eat in because ordering for pick up is a lost cause if you want hot pizza.",

Fortunately, I wasn't starving so the extensive wait for 1 slice of cheese pizza wasn't excruciating. I had lots of time to observe the  mass of kitchen workers giving each other dirty looks, but not  communicating otherwise. All kinds of backed up. To go orders consistently served plated, then slung in boxes upon complaint. Scrambling to complete incomplete orders. Piles of to go orders stacked up on top of the oven, but not being served to the angry mob waiting. It was entertaining for me, at least. $3.25 was a bargain for the 10\" slice, but it was just average. No real sign of sauce. The greasy cheese was somewhat authentic, but not tasty enough to warrant the artery clog. Decent thin crust, actually nice balance of sweet/salty.",

I paid for the full order and he mentioned, call an hour before the delivery time to make sure it was on the way...okay? Not sure why I have to call in the middle of our wedding when it's a scheduled delivery. The time we agreed on was 1:45 and the pizza showed up at 2:30, cold and hard. We immediately called and was told it was our fault that they were late and this is why they don't do delivery. Okay, but from day one, no one mentioned delivery was an issue. He kept saying his delivery driver was in the parking lot when he was not, it was a business address. While on the phone on Sunday they said a full refund was to be issued. It's now Wednesday, and we called to check the status of the refund and was told the owners told him it was dropped and delivered and ate, so no refund. This completely ruined the timeline of the day considering I booked the venue for a specific time to eat. We had to stay later at the venue because the pizza went on a 45 minute joy ride with the delivery driver.  The manager doesn't seem to know what he is doing, delivery driver was clueless, and the owners seem not to be involved. Too bad. Do not use them if you want things on time and warm. Oh or any sense of customer service.",

With that said, the tables were kind of dirty but only 2 of the 15/20 tables were taken.  Other people's orders also seemed to be coming out incorrect a lot. At least 4 people while we were there had to return to the counter because of incorrect order. They fixed it without any problems, but just note that you might want to check your takeout order before leaving.",

    "text": "I went into Tony's with my family at approximately 6pm on Saturday, August 10th.  I was greeted at the front register by a cashier named Oscar S who was saying \"next, I can help who's next.\"  There were about 4 people waiting there, but all were either waiting for their food already or looking at the menu.  We were looking at the menu to see what we wanted.  Oscar then said, \"NEXT, okay no one's next?  That's fine,\" and he walked away.  I said, \"we're looking at the menu, man, give us a minute.\"  He ignored us and went into the back.  Then the woman at the front took our order when we were ready a few seconds later.  No smile, no hello how are you, no emotion what so ever.  My wife paid for the food and used two cards to do it.  We put $20 on one card and in the middle of putting the balance on the other card the woman at the register asks, \"what are you doing?\"  My wife tells her she's putting the balance on the other card.  So incredibly rude!    This is absolutely horrible customer service and Tony's pizza should be ashamed for hiring such immature, unprofessional people in customer facing rolls.  I will NEVER come back here and will tell everyone I know to stay far away from this location.  Feel free to playback the camera footage if you don't believe me.  Horrible service, disgusting attitudes, poorly managed pizzeria.",

    "text": "Tony's used to be our go to pizza place that we would recommend to everyone! We placed an order on Friday night through Postmates for a 15\" Bianco pizza with an order of wings - 32$ that we spent for our meal. At 820pm we were quite disappointed - the wings were extremely dry and burnt and the pizza was almost impossible to eat resembling dry, tasteless cardboard (even our dogs were having trouble eating it). Now I understand that sometimes there are off nights or possibly things were very busy and mistakes happen. I called Tony's at 845pm to let them know how our food arrived and tasted and the staff member I spoke to was very kind and apologetic stating he would make us a fresh new order at no charge if we wanted to pick it up before they closed or another day this weekend. I told him since they were about to close I would take him up for another day this weekend, he told me he would make a note in the system for us and apologized again. Today I called to place that order- I was told by the manager that there was no record of my order in the system and that I did not eat there Friday evening. He rudely told me he had heard nothing of a burnt pizza & wings that evening and knew nothing of giving out free pizzas. I explained what I was told Friday evening and that I did in fact order from that location and that it was still in my Postmates as proof. The manager told me again he had no record in his system and told me there was nothing he would do for me. Nice to know we paid 32$ for horrible food and poor customer service. We will definitely not be going to Tony's pizza again nor recommending it to others.",

I called and placed the order to pick up a large pizza half cheese and half pepperoni with the person on speaker phone with my friends. The person on the phone repeated my order back to me to confirm what I asked for. Well when I got there they had my order incorrect. It was all pepperoni. I was starving and I stayed at the order that I placed was not accurate. The cashier just repeated the price multiple times without correcting the order or apologizing.  My friend who happened to accompany me for the pick up knew what was ordered and attempted to speak to personnel who worked at the restaurant. I ended up reluctantly paying for the items out of sheer hunger. My friends talked a guy working in the back to offer us some compensation for the issue. They have a large Pepsi. The pizza was okay, but definitely a memorable experience. Not worth the hassle and for an okay product I'll try other places in the future.",

We got drinks and sat down and they called out our order for mozzarella sticks that were ready. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good, you can't go wrong with fried anything in life. We ordered a Sicilian veggie pizza and a 24\"inch cheese. Both pizzas were massive and more than enough to feed our tribe of 3 growing boys and 4 adults. The Sicilian pizza and cheese both were good but I felt like the sauce was just okay and whoever made the pizza had a heavy hand with the sauce. The veggie Sicilian had a lot of veggies which I definitely was happy about.It was almost 70.00 for two orders of mozzarella sticks and two massive pies which I felt was a bit steep but in Tony's defense we do still have a lot of pizza left over.  Better than papa johns but not better than authentic New York style pizza joints.",

Although cold, the pizza was still good but needed to be reheated. The driver stated there was a problem with the app.... my first GrubHub order, ugh. Not the restaurant's fault. Kind of them to wait for the driver. Would definitely order again, but maybe pick it up? Thank you for waiting on the driver Tony's!!!

I have never been to NY but this is how i would picture NY pizza. its huge! you have to fold the slice in order to eat it, which is awesome. I got a spinach calzone and it was really big too and I couldn't finish it. it was still delicious the next day for lunch reheated. The pizza crust is thin, which is great and the sauce and cheese distribution is perfect as well. The atmosphere was what you would expect and fit what I believe they want to capture in a pizza place. You have to seat yourself and you wait till they call your name and as another reviewer noted, yes you must pick up your own trash and throw it away. But that is part of the experience. When in rome right!? We can no longer get pizza anywhere else. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Marios, all of them make us cringe and want to gag. this is the best pizza place in town! I do not eat pizza much (too many carbs) but my husband lives for pizza like he needs it to survive and he cannot think of going to another place again.",

Girl on the phone, said they usually are made with sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms but we can add the onions and peppers at no charge.  My wife said, \"Really, no charge?\".  Girl said yes.  I go to pick it up and, of course, get charged for two extra toppings.  I tell the guy the story but he doesn't believe me since he didn't take the order.  (As far as I could see, there was only one female working.)  Told him I would not return. By the way, the TV's are usually turned to Spanish speaking networks.  Since all of the customers last night were English speaking and all of the employees are Spanish speaking, I wonder if the TVs are there for the customers or the employees?

To begin with,  the restaurant could have been cleaner.  The floors and tables had not been cleaned for a while. We were there for at least an hour and I did nor see anyone go around and clean up. Secondly, it took a very long time to get our pizza and they got the order wrong.  They offered to fix the order and it took another long wait to get the additional slices.  We had a mushroom pizza and I noticed that the color of the mushrooms was different than you would usually expect. My astute 12 yr old son said they were probably from a can which may have been the case. Nevertheless, the pizza was pretty good.  They make a thin crust that I prefer.  The slices are big and a medium size is big enough for a family of 4. We will return soon but I will check on the mushrooms before ordering. They need to do periodic cleaning of the dining room during the night.",
