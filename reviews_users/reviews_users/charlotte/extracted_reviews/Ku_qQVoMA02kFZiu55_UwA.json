    "text": "While trying to find a place to watch the Final Four games we came across this place and loved it. The seating was seat yourself, we got lucky and managed to get two tables and bring them together(we had quite a few people). It was busy. But cleared out after the first game, picked back up before the second. The food was good. I tried the fried onion appetizer. Can't remember the name but the description made me think of a blooming onion from outback. This one was a little different Bc the onion was more in clumps. Not quite onion rings, but not in a circular shape either. They had a nice tangy sauce with a little heat that came with them. Other people ordered wings and burgers and all enjoyed their food. The brass tap has a great draft beer selection and also a good bottle selection as well. Tvs pretty much along all the walls so you can see the games very well. Good spot! I will def return!!",

I am currrently on a gluten free diet, and have never had an issue eating anywhere in charlotte. When I asked if they had a GF menu, they did not, ok fine. The eye opening DISGUSTING part is when i asked if they could check certain items were gf.  For example, I asked if the chilli was gluten free (since most homeade chilli's are). To my surprise, they said it comes out of a bag from a distributer and they do not know the contents of the ingredients! When i asked about a few other items, the server admitted that NOTHING is made in house. This was proven with my husbands clearly formerly frozen patty and formerly frozen waffle fries.  I went with the hummus and asked if i could have additional produce to dip in it. All they had were celery which was FROZEN and precut cucumbers for salad. THey could not even slice up fresh cucumbers.  Charlotte is an area that has so many fresh, local, handmade restaurants that why would anyone go to an establishment for disgusting food.   We were so disappointed and will never return back to this establishment.",

We sat waiting a good while for our beers and we were never served water until asking a couple more times.   I am a big fan of buffalo chicken dip. Of course our group ordered it to snack on since we were starving and things seemed to be moving pretty slow. The dip was nothing to brag about but what got me were the stale chips. I wouldn't order it again.   I ended up not even ordering anything to eat. The server wasn't helpful and we felt that we were an inconvenience.   Overall I was pretty disappointed. The staff working that night seemed as though they didn't want to be there and it brought the energy of the entire place down. This place has a lot of potential. I may give it a try in the future again.",

The selection was pretty large but might could use a bit more diversity and maybe some specialty taps.  Could very well be that I caught them during a time they just simply didn't have any.  The interior is cozy and the bar is nice and long, inviting you to come sit right as you step into the dining area.  The parking is street side only I believe, but I do recall a parking lot down the street that you can likely utilize if needed.",

    "text": "I wish yelp had halves so I could give a 2.5 but unfortunately the BrassTap left me extremely underwhelmed. We were excited to check the place out and grab a drink and the beer list didn't disappoint - a lot of options you don't see too often so that's a plus.  However, holy heck that food, eh. We were surprised about the decent prices but it made sense after we got our meals. One of our meals was the 4 Meat Pretzel Pizza and she said personal sized but we honestly thought we were in a Chuck E. Cheese with how child size and doughy and mediocre it was. We also got a \"Large Tempura\" Shrimp meal and it was just a small plate of a dozen small fried shrimp and about 6 fries. We considered another plate but after the first two and looking around, we decided against it. Then after getting the bill it took about 15 minutes to get the waitress again to pay and go. So the meal and paying portion of the experience didn't pan out well.   There a bunch of tvs and the patio is a nice touch but the decor felt a little too dark and dungeony for a place trying to give off a laid back vibe.   All in all, we give second chances so we'll probably go back to try other meal options and hopefully it'll be better but if not, I wish this wasn't so but it's just not a place I see frequenting too often.",

I work in the service industry, so I know how bad it stinks to receive an unwarranted bad review about seemingly good customer service, but some of the females here have been some of the rudest individuals I have ever encountered at a bar/restaurant. One even went so far as to scream at us because their friend was unhappy with a member of our group? Where's the professionalism!   However, the 1 star is being given solely for the great beer selection and decent food. Outdoor patio is nice as well. I guess my one recommendation would be to just teach the staff a lesson or two on professionalism, and to maybe not say EVERYTHING that comes to mind. Some of the staff is GREAT though, I do want to make that distinction.   I'll probably return, as long as we aren't kicked out at 12 again when the posted hours clearly state 2am. We get it, you don't enjoy a slow night, GET USED TO IT! That's the industry.",

I love that they come with carrots instead of the usual celery.  -The pretzels with beer cheese sauce are also fantastic. I'd come back just to have a beer and pretzels. A little pricey though at around $8.00.  -The beer selection is awesome.   Now for the not-so-good.  -The salads are awful. Literally looks and tastes like ice berg lettuce with kraft singles on top. I couldn't eat more than one bite it was so gross. For $7, it was a major disappointment. Maybe I shouldn't have expected a good salad from a bar. After complaining about the salad, it was still left on the tab. -We ordered a flight of 4 beers. First we were told it was $8, then waitress came back and said it was $10. No worries. But when the check came it was actually $12! The beers were good, but the surprise bill was annoying.  -Weird rap music was playing in the background. Didn't really seem to fit the sports bar atmosphere.   We'd come back just to watch a game and grab a beer, but that's about it.",

They're walking around introducing themselves and checking to make sure everything is good and great. Now for someone that can be overwhelmed by too many choices this place sounded like it would be anxiety ridden for me. Fortunately the bartenders and servers are great. They let you taste beers you're uncertain about and they make great recommendations. There are 70 beers on tap! Not only do they have craft beer, but they make excellent cocktails and have wine!   I went for the soft opening and tried a few different items off their menu that they were passing around, everyone was great! They were nice and helpful. I was back again on opening day and it was packed for a Monday. I tried the buffalo chicken dip and the caprese flat bread. Let me tell you, those were excellent choices. The buffalo chicken dip wasn't too spicy or overwhelming. It was great! The flat bread was a good choice too. The next time I came for food I tried the Cowboy burger and it was good, I got the Cowboy sauce on the side, but I think next time I'll have it on the burger.   The Brass Tap is has a lot to offer, from different types of beer, cocktails, and assorted food on the menu; you're bound to find something for everyone. The atmosphere is nice and inviting. The tables are first come first serve, but they do have a nice patio with bar games like giant jenga and connect four. If there is a sporting event, make sure to come early so you can grab a table or a spot at the bar!   Make sure to try this place out in SouthEnd, it's conveniently located next to a brand new brewery as well!",

The next time, I can't even remember the beer that I ordered, but it was some type of Pilsner... The Florentine panini was out of sight, though... It was kind of like having spinach artichoke dip on a sandwich... And their home fries are the diced potatoes kind...  Both times, they were piping hot and had the perfect crisp on the outside...

The pizzas and flat breads are all very tasty - the burgers are excellent - and their Peri Peri wings are fantastic (ask for them well done, trust me!  Along with all the tasty food they have a shit tone of beers on tap, tons of tv's, games, and a great outdoor patio.

Great ambience, a lot of people but not too crowded to the point where we couldn't sit, not too loud for a Friday night, and had a great selection of beer. We ordered drinks after about 10 minutes. I ordered a wine and my boyfriend ordered a beer after a few very grumpy bartenders pretended to care about his questions concerning the beer menu. They did give him samples of a few beers which was nice, but not happily. He finally found the beer he wanted and it definitely was good-a raspberry wheat beer (can't remember the name).  After about 15-20 minutes we finished our drinks and had to wait another 15 minutes for anyone to ask if we wanted another or if we wanted to cash out. We kept trying to get our bartenders attention but they seemed to blow right past us. We finally did get someone's attention and paid, still feeling that we were a burden on the bartender.  We did not eat here but I would be willing to go back and try the food and service again. The menu was pretty big and offered a variety for low prices considering its south end and things tend to be pricier.",

Not terrible, but not good either. What we got: Wings- the best thing we had All American burger Meat lovers pretzel pizza BLT chicken wrap French dip- this is what I got and it was not good at all.   Service was great. The server we had was very friendly and personable. It was also extremely hot inside. I think this is due to the patio door opening and closing. Something to keep in mind on a hot day. Unfortunately I don't think we will be going back. (Sad part is I live a block away, and wanted to be able to go back)",

They also have a decent liquor and wine selection. Outside, covered patio with heaters. They have several TVs outside and inside. The outdoor patio made for a nice setting to enjoying a few of the games and relax under the comfort of the heaters. The menu looks to have a variety of options. Giving them a 5star based on environment, service and drink selection. Didn't try any items off the food menu - I will have to come back for that.",

Glad this place is open and a nice addition to the SouthEnd \"places to hang out.\"    Right off of Summit, there are places to park for 1440 S Tryon building or a short walk from the Bland Street Lynx Station - just be careful crossing Tryon at the weird intersection where it splits into Camden, but there are proper crosswalks and just be patient with the lights at the intersection.  Car vs. walker is never a good situation for the walker.  Walk in... no hostess table, sit where you like.... lots of places at the bar and someone is taking your order.  This place has a ton of beers on draft and a large bottle selection...  if you can't find something to drink here there is probably something wrong with ya.  Pretty extensive menu for eats as well.  Lots of \"shareables\" or appetizers/bar food.  This place is a chain (from Florida?) but its not a bad thing.  I like what I've experienced so far.  It feels like a stand alone place and a great addition to the Charlotte scene.",

Parking was a little tricky when we got there at 4:45, and based on how crowded it was when we left, I'm guessing it got downright hairy!  The inside is really cool - dark wood for coziness but high ceiling skylights for openness and light. The bar is long with a bajillion taps (mostly local - NoDa, Sugar Creek, Sycamore, Unknown, D9, etc.), and there's a covered patio, too. We sat inside and got friendly, consistent service. I had a couple of glasses of wine, and the fella got a few draft beers. Their bottle list was interesting, but some of the prices were insane... stick with the tap list!  We split a combo appetizer ($13.99), which came with pork pot stickers, eggrolls, and tempura shrimp, and tempura chicken tenders ($5.99), which we had seen come out to other people and looked delicious. Everything was really good. I don't usually have high standards for \"bar food,\" but it wasn't greasy or heavy, and the dipping sauces were pretty delicious, especially the sweet chili sauce.",

    "text": "Checked out this place during Wooden Robot's soft opening for a quick lunch before a long day of libations (Whatever, I had a Friday off, don't judge). Their beer list is awesome! Definitely some things that I hadn't had, or heard of before. I won't review those here, because that's what Untapp'd is for.   The pros of this place: The food is really high quality and unique pub fare. The beer list is pretty awesome, the star of this massive tap wall is local brews, which is great to see.   The cons: As Tom Petty said, the waiting is the hardest part. The first two beers we ordered took about 5-7 minutes to come out. It didn't seem like the floor staff (as opposed to behind-the-bar) was allowed to go and pull the tap handles. Come on :/  We started out ordering a small side order of their pepper jack Mac 'n Cheese, because we were waiting for a few more friends to join. This order of a small dish took about 18 minutes to come out. It was great Mac 'n Cheese, but not 18 minutes great. Our main dishes were probably the most timely out of all things we ordered, coming out at about 15-20 minutes. That was acceptable. The rest wasn't.  We visited during a very very slow lunch hour, and I don't understand what took so long with a majority of our waiting. I hope this place picks up; I'll definitely be back, and I don't want to drop the rating. I want this place to get the 4-5 stars that it has the potential to get!",

After coming back from a Charlotte football game, my girlfriends and I tried this place since we had heard good things. I wish I had checked out my trusty yelp before stepping in the door. It was a cold night and the bar was pretty packed. Luckily, we found a table by the window and squeezed in. The temperature inside was almost as cold. Our waitress wasn't mean, she was just bad. Clearly, they were understaffed. We literary had to wave her down anytime we needed anything. She didn't come to check our beer or water once during our hour and half visit. We left with all empty glasses and only received silverware after flagging down a bus boy.The bus boy brought out all our food and he was the most polite and helpful out of the entire staff- Thank you for being the only good part of this place. Our Margaritas weren't bad, but the chicken tacos were underwhelming. Some random pieces of chicken thrown atop of shredded melted cheese and hot sauce. I ordered the PERI PERI GRILLED CHICKEN PANINI, this was absolutely horrible. I thought about sending it back but was afraid I wouldn't  get a second order of anything since our waitress played a disappearing act. My sandwich was all bread with two little pieces of shredded chicken (not grilled) ,I was eating a hummus sandwich, a bad one at that. I'm really not one to give a lot of bad reviews, but as I'm writing this, i'm just reminded of how bad this place is. We ordered an app, drinks and 6 meals and all of us left disappointed. I would stick to beer when you visit the Brass Tap or just go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Let me start this review by saying I know this is a bar and people come here to drink and have a good time, but there are still limits. We arrived Sat 9/26 around 6 pm to celebrate my sisters birthday. We tried to sit out on the patio but there was a group of 12 or so behind us talking and cursing loudly and screaming at the top of their lungs at the tv to the point we could not even carry on a conversation with each other so we moved inside. Most people don't know how to act in public any more any way and it gets even worse once they get some alcohol in them and that there are other patrons around them that may not care for that type of behavior or language. Now I'm not saying Iv'e never used a profane word in my life. As a matter of fact, I've used quit a few of them over the years, but I try not to use them in public and not every word that comes out of my mouth is profane unlike most of the people here tonight. Inside was a little better but the noise level really didn't come down till around 7pm when the college football games came to an end.  The Appetizer: Warm soft salted pretzel pieces with warm beer cheese. Very good  The Beer: They advertise over 300 beers and we tried quite a few that night, but by the same token, they were out of over half a dozen or more we wanted to try.  Food: Typical pub grub that was good. I got their version of fish and chips and my sister let me try her ribeye sandwich on ciabatta bread. Both were very good.  Service: I don't understand the bad reviews for service. Even thought it was busy, our server, Molly was on top of her game, answering our questions about the beers and making recommendations. She took our food order and brought the meals promptly. She kept the beers coming and quickly cleared away empty glasses and plates and checked on us often.  Over all we had a decent time. Food and service were good but it was way to loud and profane to the point doubt I will ever go back. I didn't enjoy trying to eat with it so loud you could not even hear the person next to you and the constant barrage of profanity. Unless you like it uber loud, including a lot and I do mean a lot of profanity, I would suggest not going on Saturdays during college football games. I suspect Sunday during NFL football would be just as bad.",

Anyone in their right minds wanting to eat there would be crazy.  Go for the beer selection and skip the food....you'll live to thank me.",

We proceeded to sit for 10 minutes while wait staff went by and were never checked on or given menus.  Finally my wife went inside and asked a manager for a server, which we got 5 minutes later.  The beer out of the tap was leukwarm.  We sat with empty beers for another 5 minutes and finally gave up.  We actually had to go inside to request to pay.  We live a block away and are unlikely to go back based on other reviews in yelp with the same experience.  There are too many options around south end for this place to last once the newness novelty wears off without very drastic improvements.",

We had ordered food, and after over an hour, we finally said something to our waitress about our food still not arriving. We didn't mind that it was taking a little while, we had some beers and were watching games. It was the fact that our waitress then proceeded to state that she thought we had already ate. Not quite sure how she thought we would have already picked up our food straight from the kitchen without her bringing it out to us, ate it all, and clear our own plates without her knowledge. She then finally spoke to the kitchen and 10 minutes later we got food. On top of this, we got the wrong order, our food was cold, and she charged extra for a side dish when it should have been included in the meal price (meals included a side). After all of this, we barely got comped for the last hour and 45 minutes of our time. She heated up our food (did not bring new food out), we still paid for the side even after we mentioned the entree included a side and we should not be charged for it, and the manager only took off a little more than half our meal. Overall, would not recommend.",

Cards Against Humanity, Trouble, Scattegories, Pictionary, Mad Gab. Some are missing a few pieces, but with some improvising, they're all just fine.   Food: Pretzels with cheese are very good. $2 tacos on Tuesday's are surprisingly good as well. Chicken, beef or fish. Came in around 7pm and had no issue finding a seat at the bar. Tacos took longer to come out then expected. I assumed everything was pre made up, but they tasted fresh so I will take the trade off. However, the Caprese flatbread was pretty underwhelming. I ordered it after a few beers and still didn't want to finish it. That's saying something.   Service: When seated at a table it has always been good. Bartender during taco Tuesday was not very friendly or attentive.   Want to come back to check out trivia on Wednesdays!",

I ordered Cabernet which was fine and the loaded tots which were terrible. They tasted as though the grease hadn't been changed in months and so I couldn't taste any of the toppings because the burnt old grease overpowered. It also claimed they had bacon on them but in reality it was just 1 giant piece. My friend got the sliders and they were pretty lame coming with only cheese on top. It was trivia night which was fun but it took so long and there was such a long amount of time between rounds. They also had 2 of the questions wrong, which is a bit picky but when you're going to play trivia you're assuming they have the right answers.",

The 2 bartenders spent the whole time flirting with each other, when asked if they could bring our drinks to us because our waitress must be on a cigerett break, they just gave is a dirty look.   Ghetto rap music with cuss words every other line. We asked if they could change the music, response was, \"This is our Saturday music\".  How's that working out for ya? place was empty.  Crap service with really bad attitudes towards customers. Went to Wooden Robot and had a blast, spent $600 between us. Big loss for this place.",

When we walked in, the bar had several seats open, so we decided to take a seat at the bar. Most of the time, sitting at the bar ensures that you will get quick service. Not here. We waited nearly 10 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us and hand us a beer list. Ten minutes later he came to ask what we needed. Why did he take so long to come over? Because he was busy talking with a woman at the other end of the bar. It was not busy. He was just socializing.   I will say that the beer list was extensive and the beer we had was good. That is why I gave 2 stars. I don't know that we will ever be back. I suppose I should have given the bad reviews more consideration before stopping in. There are plenty of other places with good beer and good service. Don't waste your money here.",

We ordered regular fries (which had bits of burnt food from the dirty fryer) and wings. The wings were breaded and sat in a THICK layer of orange grease. We saw other odd items, such as a bruschetta served in a giant martini glass (why?!?) and tater tots in a skillet (again why?!)

The beer menu was extensive and had a lot of options. I had a raspberry beer of some sort and my friend had a cherry tart cider. We both liked our drinks. Appetizers were 1/2 off when we got there so we ordered the combo, which had potstickers, southwest egg rolls, and tempura shrimps. We really liked it and it was perfect for two people sharing.   Several reviewers have complained about the service but we had a great experience. Our server, Ja, was helpful, friendly, and checked in with us often to see how we were doing, refill our drinks, etc.   For the meal, I ordered the buffalo wrap. Now, if you've read my other reviews, you know I love wraps and buffalo wraps are my favorite. This did not disappoint! I really liked the the wrap was grilled and the tortilla was crispy. There was a lot of chicken and the buffalo sauces was tasty. I ordered a side of the waffle fries and there were overcooked but still okay. That would be the only thing that could've made this meal better. My friend got a burger and waffle fries and she really enjoyed here. We both agreed that this a place we would come back to.",

    "text": "Visiting town for race weekend and decided to tour some breweries in South End. I wanted to watch the xfinity race so this looked like a great bar to do this at while drinking local beers. First of all, there was only 1 bartender to serve too many people. I know this is the fault of the ownership and not the bartender but I've never left a bar so angry. The bar had 12 TVs from what I could see where I was sitting at the bar and 6 of them had women's softball on. This is Charlotte race weekend and not one TV had the xfinity race on. How do you not have the Charlotte Motor Speedway race on in a bar IN CHARLOTTE?! I asked the bartender to change one of the TVs to it and she basically gave me a \"f*** you\". I chugged my beer, paid, and left. The beer cost $6.50 and I paid with a $10. All I got back was $3 so she gave herself a 50 cent tip without my consent. Pretty sure this is illegal. I wanted to watch the race so I didn't have time to contest so I ran out of there to the All American Pub(highly recommended). DO NOT GO TO THIS BAR IF YOU WANT EVEN AN IOTA OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. I've never had a bar piss me off so badly . Please do not give this place business. They don't deserve a time (which is obvious by the way they stole money from me ). ANGRY!",

We were there early and the place wasn't packed at all. There's tons of beer taps  behind the bar and if you have questions...just ask! They are happy to bring you over some samples!   I can't remember the beer that I got- but the waiter explained it as an \"upgraded\" version of a blue moon. Whatever it was it was really good! I rarely stray from my local favs but this was worth it!   Tuesday is $2 tacos! For. The. Win.   I ordered a pork, beef and chicken. They were all pretty good and definitely hit the spot. We also ordered some pretzel bites with beer cheese and jalapeno beer cheese. My fav was the jalapeno but both were good choices.   A-ok in my book. I'd come back again to grab some drinks and apps.",

The menu has changed and the food isn't good anymore, plus the service has become sub-par...and it's not the waitstaff's fault. They are ALWAYS understaffed.    Came back again....honestly hoped the last time we were here was a fluke, but it was not. Went to order a flatbread, and they were out...as in out of all flatbreads. A staple menu item, and they had none. Then tried to order a different appetizer item. Out. If it was busy, I might understand it, maybe, but as an established chain, I don't understand how you run out of multiple food items or an entire section of your menu.   I think the only reason this place stays in business is because it's in South End and the area is so inundated with people.",

Their selection of tacos is limited (3 types) pulled pork, fried fish, and steak, but that's not a negative thing to me. These are hands down, the BEST tacos, that I've ever had. They're fairly loaded, and for the price, they can't be beat. I've made this my regular spot to go, especially on Tuesday, and their selection of beers and ciders is great as well. They have a daily special each day of the week, so there's always a reason to come in.",

With just about 75 beers on tap,  you are sure to find a poison you will love.  I tried the Oskar Blues Gubna and at a whopping 10% is rather light and refreshing WHAT! Trust me,  great stuff. We also decided to order the fried buffalo chicken wrap and jalapeno corn fritters. Delicious   Also tried the Hi Wire Man Eater. Surprised that it has a jalapeno or habanero or some kind of pepper taste. Interesting flavor when not expected.    Great place to unwind.  They have been open for bout a year. So if you have been here early on,  come back.  They have made positive changes.  Jay and Zack were perfect and answered all our questions and provided great company during our visit.    Must try!",

    "text": "Happy hour review only.   We walked in around 5 yesterday and found brass tap with only a couple of other patrons. It didn't stay that way though, by 545-6 it was packed. We're were also lucky to find $2 tacos (beef, chicken and beer battered fish) as a taco Tuesday special, the tacos were ok, the beer battered fish was meet crunchy and flavorful. Since it was half off shareables, we decided find something of the menu as well. Keep in mind, this is only valid for the appetizer portion of the menu and does not include pretzels, flat breads, or sliders. They really need to include that in HH as well, technically these are all small plates to share too.   We ended up ordering the Rosemary and herb waffle fries and a 10 piece wing order (garlic parm and peri peri sauce). Food took a while to come out but the service was good. I wasn't a fan of the Rosemary \"powder\" on the waffle fries. It was too dry and I expected actually herbs to coat my potatoes. The wings were so good! Fried to perfection and tossed with a generous amount of sauce. The peri peri was surprisingly spicy, loved it, and the garlic parm was so creamy.   Everything came out to $18 ( I also got a house margarita, was good too, slightly strong). Be careful, the wings never get docked 50% off on the first bill, they have to manually input it in. I would have paid full price for wings if I didn't check before I handed my card over.  I will def have to come back for the wings, they were awesome.the lettuce wraps looked good too!",

I'll definitely be back for those. Plus the wings were only 50cents! I wish I knew when they run their wings specials so I can return ( it doesn't say online.

Beer. Bottles and drafts. A ton of it. All of it. Changing taps with the seasons and what not. I mean, I got an adult root beer float. Do I really need to say anything else? That's right, Not Your Father's RB on draft the last two times I've been here. Warning: drink your float quickly or it will overflow. Don't like beer? They have cocktails and wine as well.   Our good friend Billy M wanted two things for his birthday: dinner and great beer. So, we came here on a Thursday night. Nailed it. Our server was fantastic. We had people coming in and out joining us. He never skipped a beat. Seriously, if this guy isn't employee of the month then he's getting robbed. I ordered the prime rib sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. Note: the mac n cheese has bacon and green onions on top. Oh, and it's freaking delicious that way. Billy got a pizza with pretzel crust. Oh yes, pretzel crust. Our table also did pretzel bites, spin dip, bacon cheeseburger flatbread, an All American burger, and the buffalo chicken wrap. Another side item note: they have waffle fries. Everyone really liked their food. I devoured my entire sandwich, poor thing didn't stand a chance.   There's a good amount of TVs for all your sporting needs. The patio is a pretty good size and they use heaters when it's cold. A ton of great specials throughout the week, including happy hour food specials. Two dollar tacos on Tuesdays. Boo-freaking-yah. Spoiler alert: they are really good. My favorite is the fist because I love peppadew peppers. You can get a couple tacos and a margarita for less than $10. Tuesdays are also game night, trivia on Wednesdays.   Until next time Brass Tap, Brass Monkey, that funky Monkey. Brass Monkey junkie. That funky Monkey....",

How is this possible? Seems a bit shady to me. And based on how dirty the general restaurant is, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. It's only redeeming quality is the service (bartenders and servers are excellent), but I cannot eat somewhere that has no health score, how can I trust that they are following procedure? I also constantly ask for beers that I'm told  \"haven't been tapped yet\" but are on the menu, or bottled beers that \"they haven't had for a long time\" but is still on the menu. The whole bar seems disorganized. I was also asked to write a good yelp review for a free beer.....I declined and wrote this instead because I want to be honest about how terrible this place is. I will not be back and I would not recommend anyone else trying this place.",

Definitely can't complain about that.   I guess the only reason for there not be 5 stars would be the price of the tacos (which were on special) compared to the size.",

I was disappointed with all the variety they had, they didn't have any kombucha.   We decided to try the Korean BBQ pork nachos and they were very good. The portion size was huge. I was impressed with the amount of meat that came on them. So many toppings, you didn't have to worry about plain chips.   Overall, it was a good place to hang out for a couple of hours after work!",

    "text": "I had lunch with a friend at the Rock Hill Brass Tap and it was great.   Best chicken tenders ever!  I was STOKED when I saw you have a location in Southend and i happened to be in the neighborhood.    I went into the Southend location about 2:00 in the afternoon.   It was empty.  No big deal I'm sure the lunch rush was over.       I sat at the bar.   Bartender greeted me like I had interrupted her.  I ordered a glass of water while looking over the beer menu.   I asked for a sample of a beer and ordered a pint.  Ordered lunch which was a fairly short wait.  Maybe 15 minutes.    Bartender never checked on me after delivering the food.  And I mean she literally positioned herself at the other end of the bar, as far as possible from me to (I guess?) avoid any interaction with me.    It was actually kinda comical because it was so obvious this person just wanted to be anywhere else.    I have never seen a bartender so sullen.    The restaurant itself is a dump.  Dirty, dirty, dirty!  As bad as the bar and dining room is I can't imagine what the kitchen must look like.    The food was mixed.  Chicken tenders:  good.  Fries: not great but OK.  Coleslaw:  looked a couple of days old. I took one bite and tasted room temp so I didn't trust.   In a nut, I usually don't rate a restaurant unless I've been at least three times but I will never return to this place.  I left a half pint of beer because I just had to get out of this depressing place.",

Update:  my wife became ill the night and next day after eating here. I wish I had read the numerous posts on the unsanitary kitchen and lack of an inspection score before making the bad mistake of eating here. We joked about this place looking like a place you see on Bar Rescue. Well, it's no joke.   EATING HERE IS DANGEROUS. YOU COULD (AND PROBABLY WILL) GET VERY SICK!!",

Let me start by saying that they only had two servers and the place was full. I don't know if this was a scheduling error or everyone called out because it was a holiday weekend but there should definitely be more than two servers on a game day. I had to give the server credit because he was doing his best to cover his section but he had a lot of tables.    Anyway, the reason why I can never give this place more than a 3 is the food. I've had a few different items from here and been underwhelmed... Especially with the wings. I ordered them crispy and wet but they had they pulled out just as it right the right temperature texture. The chicken tenders and fries were good. I like when tenders look like they took a chicken breast and chopped it up. I'd order that again.    There's new management so I'm hoping the food (especially the wings) get better.",

They have a cute outside patio that is tented and heated with ceiling heating lamps in the winter. Service was very good and since it was slower we were treated like kings!

When the food arrived (it was $7 build your own burger night) it was delicious and perfectly cooked. His recommendations were spot on. We even decided to substitute the fries for the tater tots, and little did we know, these were hand crafted in house! The best tots EVER!   The beers were also cold and never empty. Byron took care of us very well and did so with a smile.  We've never experienced a server that exuded such genuine positive energy.   Later on in the eve, the kitchen passed out samples to everyone of a potential new desert item. It was simple, but utterly delicious! We even had the opportunity to chat with, Sade, the gal behind the idea and the food. She was passionate and very interested in our opinion.   Definitely a five star experience! Wonderful food and fantastic service. We will be back.",

And they often have beer reps in for special nights that involve some good beer swag.  The food sounds way better than how it comes out so I would say stick to some of their basic apps that can't go to wrong with like pretzel bites.  If you are not familiar with the area there is very little off street parking which continues to get tighter as new complexes go up.  The service is usually pretty good and it is one of the few places in the area that has a good amount of TV's to catch a game.  It is a bit loud and has the younger SouthEnd crowd and there is not a ton of tables unless the weather is warm enough to sit on the porch which is heated.",

I highly recommend the Peri Peri wings, prime rib nachos, sliders, and pub burger. I don't normally order burgers at a restaurant, but the sliders and pub burger were extremely tasty. Lots of TVs and a great patio with plenty of fans. Opened by a couple local guys, and we were happy to support them. If you like good beer and good food, you can't go wrong here.",

The food was very uninspired and was your run of the mill bar food. They really need to get their kitchen and bar service together if you can't keep it together on a Friday/Saturday night you will never survive. Thankfully the manager comped our food which was very nice of him. May give them one more shot because they do have a great selection of beer but the food and service is lacking.",

    "text": "We had the best experience at Brass Tap during our most recent visit. Bartender Jah was fantastic. He asked us what kind of beer we like and gave us a sample of a beer he thought we should try. He was spot on with his recommendation. As a result, I found a great new summer beer to enjoy. He was extremely knowledgable about the crafts on tap. The food was pretty good as well. Great service, great spot in the South End! Would highly recommend.",

    "text": "I don't make a point of writing bad reviews but I can't remember when I have had service this bad before.  We took a table outside right after it was cleaned off.  We were there at least 20 minutes before anyone ever came to our table.  There was no \"sorry for the delay\" she just left the menus and walked away.  Our servers name was Allisha, it took her 30 minutes from the time we sat down to bring us are first round of beers.  We eventually got our food, which even as she dropped that off did little more than leave the food.  There wasn't even a \"enjoy your food\".  We never saw her again to even try to order another beer.  We finally got our bill and then she took off again.   As I was vented about how bad the service was one of my friends pointed out that \"we don't know, maybe she's having a bad night\", But I've served tables before and even on a bad night I'm still polite to my tables.  Allisha comes back out to the patio, which I'm sure she'll come get our tabs and cash us out, instead she goes to another table, takes time to go through the menu with them, is full of smiles and nice and chatty... (not typical of someone having a bad night), then instead of grabbing our tabs, she heads back inside.   I've been here once before, have never dealt with this server and throughout the ordeal we were nothing but patient.  There was no excuse for the crappy service we received.  Even when she finally dropped off our checks/change she didn't say a word.  Is it so hard to say \"thanks for coming in\"?    The idea of never knowing what other people are going through goes two ways.  In our case, my wife and I were given a rare chance to go out without our kids and we chose to hit Brass Tap.  So our one night was pretty crappy thanks to the crappy service.    I will say, the food I had was good, but the service made me want to never return.",

    "text": "Not the best but definitely not the worst. We had a table on the patio to watch the UNC game and had a hard time getting our servers attention if we needed anything. I got a Margherita pretzel crust pizza. They are personal pizzas that even though the pretzel crust sounds weird it's just normal crust. The pizza is a little soggy but the crust is good. It is a bar so you shouldn't expect the best pizza of your life. Overall this has a nice atmosphere and is a fun place to watch your favorite sporting event. My suggestion is if you want to drink a lot get up and go to the bar to order your drink because like i said you'll only see your waiter once every hour. Another tip is that they have a mimosa pitcher that is $10, it is solid and a good bang for your buck!",

    "text": "Oh, I had mixed emotions walking into what used to be Dharma Lounge to check out The Brass Tap.  Did I need to show my ID to the bouncer and pay a cover charge?  They left the stand at the front to use it for the host stand which made it feel even more like I had to do that.  Anyway, this place is part of a chain based out of Tampa which I did not realize before perusing the site.  However, I had to give them a shot because of the wide selection of beer.  They also have liquor, mixed drinks, and some wine.  I had an Ass Clown pumpkin IPA which was not good at all, but not the Brass Tap's fault.  They also had half off of shareables (appetizers) until 7 so I I ordered a beef quesadilla.  It was a decent size but it was typical.  They have different specials every day so you may want to check their site or social media to see what they have.  The bartender was pretty nice too and we conversed a little bit about the old Dharma Lounge.  I would return here.  It is not a huge place, but it does have a patio and would be a good place to go after work because they have something for everyone.  It basically reminds me of a smaller Duckworth's but with much more of a corporate feel to it.",

You know, everyone has a ton of IPAs, but we're stout/porter drinkers, and I've found a couple that I really like from trying there. We did have one incident where the service kind of sucked, but the manager immediately made it right, and I have a lot of respect for that. The only thing I really don't like about the place is the parking.",

The sausage crumbles were over-fried and tasteless, the potatoes had a rubbery texture, and the biscuit was chewy around the edges, a clear sign that it was frozen and then reheated.   On our way out, we saw a couple with only water in front of them who were waving their hands in frustration. They got up and left almost immediately after. The place was nearly empty at the time. Given the plethora of great brunch options around Charlotte, this place should be low on your priority list, if at all.",
