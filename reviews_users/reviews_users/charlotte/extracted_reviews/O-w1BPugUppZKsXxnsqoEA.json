The food is always hot and fresh and the service is always good. I'm not a friendly person but the guy who takes care of me is always polite. This is an amazing place and I plan to be a regular patron. I just moved here from NJ for the year (work) and never thought I'd find a good \"fast food\" joint. This place is it. Hats off to management and the crew----you guys know your food.",

I would drive by the Burger Shop and think maybe but it never had enough cars out front for me to go inside.  That closed, the building looked dilapidated but one day, it opened as Kavkaz.  Every time I drove by Kavkaz, I thought of that Seinfeld when Jerry convinced Babu to open a Pakistani restaurant that failed.  I think he was deported or something...I loved that show.    Anyway, the Steak 'n Hoagie Shop opened and its doing very well.    I tried just a regular cheesesteak along with the onion rings and I must say, I'm impressed.  Since I've been down here, I have yet to have a really great cheesesteak (had a couple good ones, lots of someone's interpretation of a philly) until now.  Everything was very good and even the onion rings were great.  I look forward to going back and being more adventurous with my order.  The only disappointment is that I wish they had fried mushrooms but oh well.",

My husband brought one home for me, and my first instinct was to grab a knife and fork to cut it up.  I USUALLY have to cut salads into bite-size pieces since most restaurants tend to serve them with huge pieces of lettuce - but not this time.  No knife was necessary for anything...not even the chicken pieces on top - which were plentiful.  Also, I love feta cheese, so I was happy that they use small chunks of feta rather than crumbles of it.  To me, crumbles of feta cheese just don't taste as good as small chunks.   The cucumber slices were even decorative looking rather than just plain sliced.  This tells me that they really care about the appearance of their finished product.  The greek dressing was also good.   My only wish for the Matthews/Indian Trail location is that they had the Greco menu option that their other locations do.",

They also have a carry out window for drive up service.  The shop is small but clean.  The bathrooms aren't the greatest, so I would try to avoid if possible.    Recommend the black & blue hoagie or the pork chop dinner! The pork chop is my favorite.  It's delicious each time.  It comes with 2 sides.  Onion rings are good.  Cole slaw, could be better.
