Elite loco: grilled corn sweet and juicy   Salsa bar with good variety of red and green salsa along with two with habanero.   Over all not bad if you want to try street food from various Latin country. On Saturday their beers are half off.",

I ordered a chicken with black beans and a steak with just cheese and both were well prepared and good but again missing something in the flavor. I will definitely be back to try other things on their menu.  Customer service at Sabor and surrounding bars/restaurants have been top notch. The staff is very friendly, considerate and funny. My cashier was very nice in recommending a few options which I ultimately settled on the quesadillas.  I would definitely recommend Sabor to friends & fellow Yelpers. They also have an cool outside spot and completely doggy friendly (woof  woof ).",

Super small seating area so if it's crowded you might not find a seat. I think the pictures of the food here are all you need to be drawn in. Authentic taste, good size portions. OH, and tacos are cheaper weekdays in the afternoon! I can't remeber exactly what time, but it's all worth it.  Let me also say that this food was so good that I didn't even cry when I saw my car had been scratched when I went back to it after eating. That's how happy this place made me.   Eat on!",

Returning this to the location in Noda is not an easy trip. Had to pay $5 to park and when I got home with the second to go order, had to throw it down the drain. The steak was scraps with fat and gristle. Couldn't even chew it! Then there was the very salty taste of the so called steak. My boyfriend didn't return his although he said he should have after trying to get through it. Don't think I will be trying this anytime soon again. And this was a place that I highly liked when it first opened,  but now it seems like they are cutting corners and it's just another bad fast food joint.",

We were down for a show at the Evening Muse, and we only had about 45 minutes until show starts. With a 45 min wait at Cabo, we had to do something faster. We stopped in at Sabor, immediately ordered and then luckily found a table. They were pretty busy, but the crowd was moving through reasonably fast. I thought the food was pretty good. Cheese dip and Fish Taco's were the order of the day. Overall, this is an ok place. The atmosphere is fine and the staff reasonably friendly. Its not Cabo, but a decent alternative when you either have less time, or want to spend less money. I wish they had more seating because that was a slightly stressful not being sure we could get a table, but in retrospect almost everyone was finding one.",

I've been here several times and EVERY SINGLE TIME the entire order is wrong.

He went back and explained that the order was wrong only to get a reaction from them indicating he was in the wrong here? You messed up an entire order and then have the audacity to act like we're the rude ones for wanting it remade correctly? After rereading the ticket multiple times and struggling heavily to make a simple burrito, they sent him on his way with the corrected order. He got home and took a bite out of the burrito to realize they had made it completely wrong YET AGAIN! I don't know if these employees are high out of their mind or just plain stupid but I'm absolutely never going back here because it's just a terrible experience every time. Cabo fish taco next door is much better and they actually give a crap about their customers and their experience. Save the headache and skip sabor.",

Thankfully, I picked up my order to-go and only had to briefly endure the stifling indoor heat. I ordered a chicken empanada and elote loco along with a nodajito (half price craft beers on Saturdays!). The menu is the same as at Hawthorne, only the beers are behind the counter at this location.  The salsa bar is tucked away in a corner directly across from the counter where you pick up your food. You are able to scoop some salsa to-go along with your complimentary chips thanks to the yelp check-in!  The staff was plenty pleasant considering the heat and the food was still good. I only wish that the toppings for the elote loco held up better once I arrived home.",

    "text": "TL;DR Incredible flavor and worth going out of your way for.  Food - 5/5 - I'm always hesitant to give 5's on food, because I always ask, \"is this REALLY as good as it gets?\"  For this type of latin/mexican cuisine, I think it is.  This is my second time here and both times have been phenomenal.  There were three of us in our group, we got three tacos, an arepa, chips, and a side of yuca fries.  Everything had awesome taste.  Tacos were moist and flavorful with a good ratio of meat to topping to tortilla.  Arepa was lightly cripsy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and the protein inside was equally fantastic.  Yuca fries nice and crispy, but not dry like most other yuca fries I've had.  Everything was just fantastic.  Decor/Ambience - 3.5/5 - It's simple and effective.  Very laid back feel with a handful of booths and tables, a serve-your-self salsa bar and drink machine.    Service - 3/5 - Definitely on the slow side in both my experiences.  This time around they were fulfilling a very large call-in order.  That being said, there was certainly no sense of urgency behind the counter.  Unless I'm feeling a little grumpy, it's not a big deal.",

Inside is pretty small, so seating may be hard to find whenever their busy! We ordered 2 shrimp tacos & 2 tilapia tacos, corn, and an veggie empanadas! The tacos were fairly good, not to salty but the tilapia was a bit over cooked, the shrimp was deff my fav. As for the corn I didn't try it but my mom really liked it so I'll take her word for it haha! The empanadas were good was well, perfectly crispy and cheesy inside(:",

The guacamole had excellent flavor and came with more than enough chips.  I was actually surprised at how much guacamole I was served.    My burrito was also excellent.  The portion was a wee bit bigger than I'd have liked but that isn't a bad problem to have.    They also featured an extensive salsa bar.  I was really impressed by the jalapeno pineapple salsa.  The also had the red and green salsas white people appropriating cultures had come to expect.    What I wanted was a simple lunch like Qdoba or Chipotle.  The only thing I didn't like was that they had stuffed so many tables in that it was hard to move around.  Also, it was noisy but I'm not holding it against a restaurant that parents put their kids at other tables and scream at them from across the room.",

So far Sabor seems to be reeling customers and staying consistently busy!  Their menu has your typical arrangement of Latin foods but also has some not so typical surprises! They have options for vegetarians as well as many gluten free options. Each day there are different specials so make sure to check on those before ordering. I've been on a Tuesday (Taco Tuesday, $1 tacos) and on Friday when they do half off craft beer!   The food is prepared right there before you and after you order you can take a trip over to the salsa bar and choose one to your likings. I believe there are about 5 or 6 different salsas. They will call your name and you can choose to sit inside or outside at one of their neat bar seats.   Overall a great addition to an already wonderful neighborhood. This is not the only one in Charlotte so be sure to check out the other location(s) too!",

If I had known I was gonna spend $14.00 on bland Elote and barely warm fries (Carne fries) I would have saved my carb splurge for Cabo Fish Taco next door. Like I hate when I go to places and ask the staff about the food and they lie and say it's amazing except it's not.   customer service-no complaints EXCEPT you have to order and pay at the counter before seating yourself. This would otherwise be fine EXCEPT they prompt you to leave a tip upfront but you receive NO personalized service. You have to retrieve your own food from a counter when your name is called, retrieve your own drinks and refills and condiments, and clear away your trash. Why and who am I tipping?!  Atmosphere-nothing special but there's free wifi and gender neutral bathrooms #win *shrugs*  Food-chile bye! I'm not even Latin and my Street Corn tastes better!   Added some of the Mexican hot sauce for as much flavor as your going to get on that thing. I was really disappointed with the fries though. They were undercooked and not seasoned at all and luke warm. Like I can't really say anything else about them.   Value-idk. I just feel like $14.00 for flavorless food is not a go in my book. I'm not sure if I'll return.   Overall I was hoping for much more but sadly all I got was calories that I didn't even enjoy consuming.",

On Saturday they have 1/2 off craft beer and their prices are very reasonable before the 1/2 off! So great deal!   We then went on Tuesday for taco Tuesday. They were good but I wasn't blown away. I got shredded chicken and beef. They were served in a corn tortilla and it was very messy! My taco kept falling apart. They come with onions, lime, and cilantro. They had a great flavor to them, but I'll probably go somewhere else for taco Tuesday.   I will 100% go back to try new things though! I saw someone order the nachos and empanada and my mouth started watering! It looked so so delicious!   They have an average amount of seating but both times it has been 100% packed! But it is worth it to wait and find a place to eat. So I recommend this place if you are looking for some Latin food for sure!",

In addition to a free salsa bar, the staff was very friendly.  The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the cashier.  The cashier responsible for ordering the meal somehow didn't give my ticket to the chefs and wasn't very familiar with the menu. He was unsure how to recommend anything from the menu and I had to go directly to the chefs preparing my food and ask if my food was being prepared (multiple people who ordered after me had already received theirs).  I'll cut him some slack since he was probably new.  The rest of the staff was extremely friendly.  I highly recommend Sabor!",

    "text": "Still scratching my head as to why/how two taco places end up next to each other, but never-the-less I'm glad there is another Sabor location option in Charlotte.  Their food is super good and I've never been disappointed in my visits to either location.  The best part about the NODA location is the space.  Compared to Elizabeth location, the NODA location has more tables.  The lines still manage to go, literally, out the door for taco Tuesdays, but it is definitely worth the wait.  Staff and are friendly and here to serve you (even though there's a slight feeling of chaos).  There are very nice staffers waiting for people to get up from the table and wipe it down for the next party and it feels like there's a flow and organization to it all.  Cannot beat $1 tacos on Tuesdays, but I always end up getting elote which is super delicious.  The salsa bar allows you to try varying degrees of heat and deliciousness.  Guess the only drawback is parking situation.  Fighting the street parking in the NODA area, but I'm glad the houses don't mind people parking in front of their homes to enjoy the great restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "I like this location best BUT THERE'S NO REAL PARKING.  Solely street parking and a pay meter lot on the next side street but that's about all.  Management here is astute and offers the little things to make your journey easier.   The staff is nice at both places but I feel everyone here is trying harder to show their sincere and eager to help....which I appreciate being new to the restaurant and all.   The specials board is immediately to the right of the register.  FREEBIE with Yelp check in remains.  I didn't notice plugs at the tables because I grabbed it to go.  The place is going through some construction work - either a build out or additions. IDK  Ummm, all in all - I am a fan and would eagerly give it 5 stars as I think of this location often and want to return but that parking makes it an easy 4 plus I have only had 1 visit.   Writing a review for this place breaks my own rule but it's soooo worth it as they provide a great service. Oh! and got the Thursday special here on 11/3/16 and they drained the grease and all. Hawthorne did not replicate this the following Thursday on 11/10/2016.  4 stars for the salsa bar. They have pineapple, 2 greens, 3 reds and the mayo based Rosado I like heat and flavor - some of the darker salsas have the heat but not the best flavor.  I'm sticking to the first two red salsas for that reason.   The chicken arepa comes with tomatoes, shredded cheese and that rosado sauce (which I don't care for) BUT the empanada is my fan favorite. IT's worthwhile and filled well. Ground beef and cheese for the Thursday special. I've had the arepa now and know I don't care for the shredded chicken but will try the pork one before making the final cut.   The chips are equivalent to the Hawthorne location. And that's all I have had to date from this location.",

    "text": "Four stars, but my most recent dining experience deserved a three.   I've had a lot from Sabor, and I've liked it every time. However, in comparison with their tacos, their burritos are boring. Today I had the Dominicano, a nice pork burrito with onions, and a delicious, creamy sauce that, if it were lighter (and more evenly spread) would have been the perfect meal. However, the amount of sauce that was towards either end of the burrito caused it to fall apart before I had even taken my second bite. It also gave the whole meal a bit of a mushy texture.   Their margaritas are wonderful, though today I opted for a Corona Familiar (being only 11:30, I opted to maintain sobriety). They have a nice beer selection with imported Latinx beers as well as some local craft brews.   If you can, I'd recommend the black bean tacos and a margarita for a quick, inexpensive lunch.   I'll be returning soon to try another burrito and be sure that it isn't a systemic issue.",

The staff is always friendly, the food is consistently solid, and even when crowded, things unusually move at a good clip. You'll never wait more than about 10ish minutes you place an order.  Also, Jarritos. You can buy Jarritos there. The whole rainbow of 'em.

    "text": "I live right down the street from this Sabor location in NoDa. I've actually only been there for Taco Tuesday before so I have yet to try a variety of menu items. For those that don't know about Taco Tuesday, it's essentially their happy hour special all day - $1 simple tacos with your choice of shredded chicken, ground beef, veggies, or black beans. They have an extensive salsa bar as well. If you check-in with Yelp you can get a free side of chips and get free salsa from the bar, making a pretty cheap Tuesday meal. I did order a side of queso one day to have with my chips and thought it was pretty good.  The tacos aren't really anything amazing, but they are good for what they are. They are basically ONLY the main ingredient without any fixings. Fore example the shredded chicken doesn't come with lettuce, cheese, or anything else. You can use the salsa bar to spruce it up a bit or add some toppings for an additional charge. That being said, I'm a big fan of getting the basic $1 tacos and doing what I can to fancy them up a little with free condiments. You can't beat spending $9 for two people to eat dinner with a fountain drink.  The staff are always friendly and helpful, even when they're slammed with business on Tuesday nights. At that time you can expect to potentially wait about 20 minutes for your food and maybe not get a place to sit right away. Overall I'm giving 4 stars based on my experience with the food thus far. I'll likely branch out from Taco Tuesday in the future and may update my review based on some other food items I try. For now it'll remain a good cheap spot for dinner with tacos that satisfy but don't go too far beyond that.",

I heard the tacos were okay so I ordered the chicken arepa which I heard were good. The arepa was definitely very hot to hold for awhile. My only complaint is that the fillings weren't really spread out. So my first few bites were all cheese. I ended up mixing it all up with my fork and scooping it out instead of eating it like an uncrustable pb&j. Overall, pretty good. They have a variety of sauces which were also good. I tried two of the spicier ones, one of which was a pineapple salsa. Not too spicy. Also tried the yuca fries which were okay.",

This past Monday (04/23/18) however, we placed an order online at the Noda location. We both ordered BYOB, one with chicken and one with pork. Neither one of the bowls had ANY rice at all, my husband's was mostly filled with lettuce and had about two spoonfuls of meat. Mine had very little rice (mind you, we did request rice), a bunch of lettuce to make up for the fact that there was barely any rice and just a little bit of chicken. This was the most unsatisfying meal we have ever gotten from Sabor. It would be nice if the people that work there could put a little bit more attention to the meals that they put together.",

The $1 tacos you can choose from include veggie, black bean, chicken and beef. I ordered shredded chicken which was bland and the ground beef which was better but still missing some spices. Also ordered al pastor from the regular menu- it was okay. It would've tastes better if it was marinated longer. Also the small size of refried beans is ridiculously small so order a size up! But you can get a huge order of chips for free if you check   It was easy to get a table, great salsa bar selection, and staff was friendly and kept the place clean. I'm hoping the next time I go that the food will be better! Crossing my fingers!",

First, the small sides come in the little cups that you get the sauces in. What? I've never in my life seen a small side given in those little cups. I was literally in awe. Clearly my bad for not asking. Second the beans tasted like they just added a tablespoon of salt in that little cup to the beans. Holy salty. The saltiest food I've ever had. Not an exaggeration. And the rice was super dry and ehhh.  We also ordered a side of plantains and it came with cheese on top. We don't eat cheese. It doesn't specify that there is cheese on the menu so we asked for a new one. I think it should state there cheese comes on them. They were good though  All in all we were super dissapinted and that was just for sides.",

    "text": "Not a satisfying food experience at all. Cheap tables and chairs are kinda pushed together. Order while standing at the cash register and then get hit up for the 25-30% tip while you're still standing there. They push the ipad at you with the tips all ready to get signed up for.   Next step, go sit down. They call your number and you hop right up and fetch your own food from the pickup area then go sit back down. Get your own self serve fountain drinks and get your own self serve sauces, and then go sit back down.   The latin street taco, for instance, is very small with a small spoonful of chicken on it. Please feel free to get up and fetch yourself some sauce so its not so awfully dry and flavorless. No employee will come by your table for any reason ever, after you have sat down. Remember that 25 -30% tip they shamed you into when you were paying your bill at the end of the ordering process?  Sucker! You end up doing everything for yourself.   You may not enjoy eating your meal off of wax paper with plastic forks, but it's all in good latin street fun. Sabor means flavor or taste. Remember this when your trying to choke down some of that bland, dryish \"street food\".  Go next door, they have much better everything.",

Second, everyone was super nice, and they have extra sauces...how could you not love it.  But, far more importantly, was the FOOD. I had the Carne Asada Fries, and an arepa. The arepa was good, but coming from Norwalk where I get the best quality arepas around, they weren't worth 5 start. BUT, the Fries - perfectly cooked potatoes covered with immense-flavored steak, and covered in cheese, sauces, and other great toppings - now THAT was what I was looking for on this culinary journey. They delivered in every aspect of this meal, and it was something I went back to a second time, even though I was here for only a few days.  If that isn't indicative of how well Sabor did for my palette, then I am not sure what is.",

I ordered two tacos and that is it. After ordering, I waited 20 minutes before the cashier said my tacos would be up momentarily. The workers behind the counter were having casual chats and kept taking breaks from what they were doing. I can understand waiting 20 minutes for two tacos if the restaurant was slammed, but it wasn't even close. Lastly, I asked for no onions and of course there were onions all over it.

Food started coming out, the other four people in our party got their food, so we're next - right?   Well we waited... and waited... and waited... People who had ordered after us were getting their food. The friends we were with were finishing their food. The people were had ordered after us were finishing their food. I went up to the \"window\" and lingered long enough for someone to ask me what was up. I explained the situation and the guy said \"man, it's a Saturday night - you should expect to wait\". Well then. This was already after about 15 minutes. I sat back down and waited another 5-10 minutes and went back up and just stood there until it FINALLY came out. Food was delicious...  I hate when people say this, but I work in the customer service industry, and I have a hard time imagining myself saying to someone that they should expect to wait because we're busy. I know you're busy, I'm really just looking for a \"oh yeah your order is fifth in line, our avocado guy is on the way back from Michoacan with a fresh batch for your guacamole...\" Perfect, I love fresh guac.  I 100% recommend going to Sabor in NoDa and Elizabeth and every other location because their food is great - just a bad experience this time.",

Of our group of six, my boodle and I were the last to order, and we ordered taco salads.   It was crowded in Sabor, but we were able to find a table. Our drinks came out quickly, and they were great to have while we were waiting on our food. Speaking of waiting on our food, we waited... and waited... and waited. Everyone else in our group had long gotten their order and almost finished, and several other patrons after us had received their food. When the hubs went to inquire, he was told that it was a weekend and we should expect to wait. I do agree with this, but it's probably not the best message to send when there's clearly a delay/issue.   Anyway, when my taco salad came out, it was awesome. The barbacoa beef has a nice kick to it, and the tortilla bowls was fresh, crispy, and delicious. I highly recommend Sabor!",

    "text": "Went to this location on Friday and liked it so much we came back on Saturday. But I just didn't really like it as much the second time.   Maybe it was the fact that they didn't actually credit me my loyalty point, or maybe it was the cashier basically telling me I was an idiot. Maybe it was the complete and utter lack of seating which left us and several other parties standing around uncomfortably with food and drinks in hand but no where to go. Or maybe it was the CHICKEN BONE I found in my taco salad. Still, maybe it was the fact that two people in our party were ID'd twice for drinks even though we were recognized from being previously ID'd yesterday and ID'd from our first round of drinks and--let's be honest here--we don't look even close to our twenties and may actually have been the oldest party in the joint. I can't really seem to put my finger on it. Maybe it was the fact that I had to pay $.10 extra for beans on Friday but $.25 extra for beans on Saturday even though I got fewer beans on Saturday.   The margaritas were good. The mojitos were too. The plantains were fabulous both nights. If I lived close enough to stop in for take out, or if I was insecure about aging and wanted someone to be ridiculous about carding me, or if I liked eating standing up, maybe I'd have been happier here. Instead, I think I'll try the fish taco place next door next time I'm around. They have the courtesy of telling you how long until a table is ready rather than letting you order and stand around waiting like a tired, hungry, dip and yelling at you if you don't have enough hands to hold all of the items you ordered and your drink while waiting for a table and then not letting you order another drink if you finished your first one before you even were able to find a seat... Too bad, though, cause I love plantains and Latin drinks at reasonable prices!",

(The CoSto's grill line leads to something good and free but sometimes a guy's just gotta eat.)  The guys running the register have always been equal parts chill and friendly. If you don't already have the Yelp app and an account you seriously need to get it solely for the purpose of free chips with a check in here. And the chips are worth actual money too so free is, well, killin' it!  You can order an assortment of tacos, burritos, bowls, salads and so-on in Tex-Mex fashion. Protein choices include pork, beef, chicken and tofu. Naturally, no meat is always an option and I would strongly recommend this joint to any vegan or vegetarian. The coolers house lots of bottled beer options and they even have a tap in the back. You can use tap to pay (Android, Apple, etc.). A good amount of seating inside. Oh and did I forget the salsas? Quite the selection here - no fewer than four options spanning from mild up to death.  They can certainly be a tad on the pricey side but I always think it's well worth it. Last bit of advice: don't plan on parking nearby. Be ready to walk. You'll be happy you did when you're done gorging yourself.",

I had a large catering order on one of the busiest nights of the week (Taco Tuesday), and I did my best to call ahead and get their early to make sure I picked up my order before the huge dinner crowd. Unfortunately, I arrived later than expected, and although it was completely my fault, the manager (Allen) took it upon himself to prepare and cook the food so it was fresh and hot for our dinner guests. He ensured that I had more than food that I needed for the order (salsa, chips, tortillas, queso, and all the toppings), and he and another staff member helped me to my car that was parked a good distance away. However, when you feed hungry middle schoolers, you run out of food quicker than expected, and so I had to go back to get more meat. Again, Allen was beyond kind and helpful to provide and cook more food himself for us even when there was a tremendous amount of customers and orders to be filled. I am extremely thankful for the help and kindness the staff demonstrated to me at this Sabor on a very busy evening as they went above and beyond to fulfill my order. Thank you!",

Maybe it's my own preference but arepas I've had in the past have been much softer and doughier in texture while this one was crunchy and hard. There was also not much cheese at all in the inside. I'd be willing to give it another try, but definitely not my favorite arepa ever.",

Here I am without $30 and no food and I drove 25 minutes to get there. Plus no voicemail on their phone to let people know they would be closing early. Highly upset. So the next day I spoke with the manager Steve and he informed me he would give me a refund and he is sorry and the online ordering should of been turned off but the next time I come I can get free chips and dip. Not really showing concern or empathy (like I can get free chips and dip just be signing/checking in to yelp) plus no type of incentive for me driving that far plus having to buy more food that night. Smh. I just know I won't be going or telling anyone about Sabor in Noda anymore. Management there HAS to do better!",

My go to is always the epic protein bowl, and my wife the nachos. We deviate sometimes and get the elote, or some tacos and never have regretted it. One time the cashier literally ran out the door after me because they forgot one taco! Not surprised sabor is blowing up and expanding all over Charlotte, it's well deserved.",

Their beef empanadas are really good. The steak nachos plate is HUGEEE and delicious (my husband and I always split one and can never finish it). Also, their guacamole is one of the best in Charlotte!!  My husband never liked guac until he had it for the first time at Sabor.   One thing we found a bit odd was the young lady at the register did not know how to make a frozen margarita. Not a big deal but I just prefer frozen over on the rocks.   Overall, we love the atmosphere and food. Whenever we drive by it is always packed, which its a great thing for a business. It would be great if they could expand in the back and have a patio for the summer time.",

What's not to love about Sabor? They have a salsa bar. That's right, an entire bar of salsas. Pro tip: Make sure to check in on your Yelp app and score some free chips. I love their queso. If you have a group, get the nachos. They are massive and a steal. Other favs for me: Three Amigos Burrito, corn on the cob, and the empanadas. Thy have different specials throughout the week, including Taco Tuesday. Warning: all their locations get packed for this.   It's NoDa, so parking sucks. Pack some patience and go drive around the neighborhood looking for a street spot. You'll need the walk back to the car to work off those tacos.",

I've never heard of this spot and decided to try something new and get something to write for Yelp.  And the verdict was that it wasn't bad! I enjoyed what they had here. The food was fresh and everything came hot right off the grill. If I was hungrier, I would have ordered a burrito or a bigger meal, but we just wanted to try out their tacos so this is what we ordered:  Chorizo Empanada. Americanos with Al Pastor, and the Autenticos tacos. The empanada was bursting with flavor and every bite gave you a mouth full of meat. The tacos were filling as well, and I would say 3 tacos would give you a decent sized meal.  The one bad thing was that I thought the price was a little much. We didn't order that much food, but yet the price was close to $25 for just two people. I think if I were to tell anyone what to eat, it would to be to stay away from the street food of the usual tacos and street food and go for the meals such as the burritos or salads/protein bowls. But, if that's the case then why even go to a Street Food place? I think if you're coming here for a snack or a light appetizer, this will definitely be the place as this is what I will remember it to be.",

    "text": "After being very impressed with my first visit to a Sabor last week, I had to give the closest one to my house a \"whirl.\" The food was as good as I had hoped, but the people just aren't the same as the guys at Steele Creek.  Ordered take out, it was at least 10 tacos (had to share the magic with the peeps at home). I got some in Al Pastor in Americanos, Authenticas, and Locos styles. We also got some with shrimp and some with chicken. The Tacos are as good as they get but my favorite is still the Al Pastor. It's cooked with pineapple and onion and works so well with the most tender pork I've ever had at a restaurant.  The service however, could be a bit better. While ordering, the man at the counter didn't say much besides clarifying which tacos would be included in Taco Tuesday and which I would have to pay extra for. Other than that I didn't get a \"Thank You\" or anything really. The vibe isn't very friendly here, and honestly it didn't seem like the counter staff wanted to be there. Before I left I asked the woman who called my name with my order if they had the Taco \"Cream Sauce\" that I got from the Steele Creek store and she bluntly said \"We're Out\" after already turning around.  A couple of pros is that it's good food, as good as the first visit, and it's very reasonably priced. Somewhat disappointed as I would probably be a twice a week customer at minimum. Fortunately, the South Charlotte and Pineville restaurants are close to my office.",

Sometimes in Latin Street food places, I find it's a bit confusing with all of the options they offer.  Our party of 5 ordered our food to-go, and they had it ready and packaged very well.  The food was flavorful, and they gave plenty of it! Love their salsa sections too. I ordered the carne asada fries and they were fab!  I totally love this place! It's a bit on the pricey side for \"street food\", but I think you're getting a good value for money!",

    "text": "So after a visit to Birdsong Brewery, we got tired of waiting for Hiya Food Truck to show up and were hungry. So we ventured down the road to Sabor. And on a Friday night, this location was busy.  I was super hungry so I went for the Sabor Especial burrito since I figured it would be more hearty. I had shredded chicken, black beans and brown rice/quinoa and the other toppings that came on it. I think quac and salsa. And I checked in for my order of free chips. They have a variety of salsas. We grabbed a whole bunch without labeling them so I really don't know which one I liked the most.   We luckily found a table. Our food came out fast. I liked the burrito a lot. It was a little messy, but I probably ate it in less than five minutes. There was a nice kick and the brown rice mix was a nice substitute for white rice.   Staff was super friendly. Like a lot of places in NoDa parking can be tricky.   We managed to find a table.",

Tonight after over a 45 minute wait (we were told 15 minutes till we could pick it up) we were again disappointed. Flavorless black beans, no chicken on the nachos and like a fleck of jalapeno after paying extra for them, arepa which was actually decent, and tacos that were so so so sad. Super dry meat, and just nothing to really get you excited about eating it. Tastes like regret, mostly. We keep trying them because when they were good, they were REALLY good. It's been years since I felt this way. I see the response on so many reviews that they are passing along this information and blah blah blah, but I wish it would actually happen. Please guys, fix it.

The lady who took my order looked like she was going to yoga or Zumba class. No one was dress like they were running a professional business. The cooks and staff was not friendly. I was better off eating drive thru food. I did not like the atmosphere at all. On to the food. The burritos were basic basic basic nothing about them wowed me. They are a good size and one will definitely fill you up but the food lacked flavor. I hear the taco were good but I didn't get them and I won't be back a 2nd time to try the tacos either. I ordered a margarita and it tasted like lemonade didn't taste any alcohol so the drinks are a thumbs down. Overall I should have just gone to Cabo next door and I would NOT have been disappointed. I have eaten at Cabo 3 times this week already and needed a break but now I know when something is great just stick with it!!!' So just to recap: staff needs to be more friendly, the woman at the register needs to learn how to dress and the food needs some flavor and love in it. Peace!",

I didn't want to get anything to heavy so I settled for the authentico shrimp tacos, plantains, and refried beans. The party I was with got a steak burrito with refried beans, and shrimp and chicken nachos.   I was really impressed by the amount of chicken and shrimp the nachos had. The nachos are more than enough to share if you want to with one other person.  The only thing I didn't care for was the refried beans they were watery and bland. No flavor at all. Everything else was really good and very filling. I will definitely be back.",

The staff is friendly enough. We noticed almost 9/10 takeout orders were wrong. Consistently. Now when I mention Sabor as a meal option my husband rolls his eyes because it's just not worth the trouble and a messed up order.   Just this past Monday he grabbed a takeout order, and I only received 1 of the 2 tacos he ordered me. No we never complained, no we don't call and tell them it's wrong. Maybe other Sabor locations are on point, but this one needs some major help in the register to kitchen communication/execution. It's really a bummer because it could be our go-to place.",

I got them in the Americanos tacos and the cheese was not at all melted because the meat wasn't hot at all.   The meat on all of them was pretty bland and not that seasoned. Probably some of the most disappointing tacos I've had. I also got the green sauce to put on the tacos and it was pretty bland as well. Overall, it's pretty clear that this place does not serve authentic food and I would recommend you save your money and head somewhere else.",

Normally I like my tacos loaded with the whole nine, you know lettuce and tomato, cheese, some sour cream... but these didn't need any of that. However they season that chicken, boy is it good.  kelsay on the other hand wanted some cheese and she opted for queso, and was equally happy. We also tried their guacamole, it wasn't our favorite, but delicious none the less. Fantastic spot and hope to be back soon",

Probably should have gone for the 1800 tequila one. We parked in neighborhood and walked to restaurant because NoDa parking is difficult.",

Ordering is easy at the counter, and while you wait for your food to be prepared, help yourself to a variety of different salsas for your basket of chips. We LOVE the pineapple habanero salsa - it's a must-try.   Taco prices range depending on the content (your basic beef/chicken vs. an upgraded version to, for example, the \"Curtido Fish Taco\" on the \"Healthy\" section of the menu). I'm a purist with my tacos and appreciate the simple tastiness of a good ground beef taco topped with lettuce, tomato, and plenty of cheese. The nachos are also a great life choice, and you can easily make them a meal for yourself (with leftovers) or share with 2-3 others.   Taco Tuesday is an amazing deal -- $1 tacos (of the basic kind). They're probably not going to be THE best tacos in the Charlotte area, but you really can't beat that price. We paid a total of $9 one Taco Tuesday for four tacos and a medium-sized guacamole to share.   Super pumped there's now a Sabor in Southend and another coming soon to uptown -- keep it up, Sabor!!",

We got a steak burrito, a grilled fish taco, ground beef empanada and a side of chips (free w Yelp check in!). Keep in mind any of the premium meats (ie, not ground beef or chicken) will carry an extra surcharge of $1 or $2. The steak was tender and a good amount. The fish taco i would pass on next time and was in sore need of a double tortilla; falling apart by the first bite. The empanada was nice and as i recall how Argentineans do them but really i prefer Colombian style. The sauce w the empanada was just like 1000 island without the relish. A little confusing.   Help yourself to the salsa bar. The mango habanero was a table favorite tho too sweet for me. I preferred the classic Verde.  Line was fairly long but wait to get your food was extremely quick. Service was friendly.  Shoulda got the nachos tho!! I saw other tables that had them and i was jealous. Huge portion!",

Friendly face greeted us as we walked up to register. I ordered some carne asada fries and husband got an empanada and a taco.  I loved my food as it was topped with a bunch of cheese, meat, and avocados. A happy triad of yummy for me! Husband was not as thrilled of his empanada, but enjoyed his taco. We each ordered a   soda bottle and missed the bottle opener on the wall. A sympathetic worker noticed our plight and opened them for us.  Overall, it's a nice neighborhood joint that serves fresh food quick. What impressed me the most was the people working here and how nice they all are  Side note: Just wanted to give a shout out to Erik - one of the guys that works here. He noticed that we were having car trouble and offered to help when he could easily have gone about his day. Without him and his dad (a mechanic), we probably wouldn't have made it home as fast we did. Some real southern hospitality! Thank you!",

    "text": "I little known secret is that I have not been as much of a fan of Mexican food as the average American. As a person whose only experience with Mexican food until the age of  18 was Taco Bell, I fell in love with hard shell, meaty and cheesy tacos and chalupas. So when I got my first tast taste of authentic Mexican food, it was not what I was used to. I stayed away for a long time after that. That was until my wife introduced me to sabor and their sister restaurant, 3 Amigos. The two places were life changing; a gateway drug into the highly addictive world of Latin cuisine. I like their empanadas, Arepas, street corn, their fries and could go on. Their Margheritas are good. The only downside to Sabor is that they don't have chimichangas. I love chimichangas and their sister spot, 3 Amigos makes the best I ever had. However, I get that Sabor has to separate itself from its sibling. There is a lot to like as Sabor does make my favorite empanada. Thanks Sabor for ushering me into Latin cuisine.",

Everything is good, and you get a ton of food for the money. My personal favorite is the taco salad- no shell. That way I can load up on chips and guac too. I love the salsa bar!",

It's as if they created Taco Tuesday, that's how crowed they get while serving their $1 Tuesday Taco special, no matter the wait or time of day, it is always worth swinging to Sabor for relatively authentic Latin fare.  Don't fret if you see a crowd out the door because food is always well prepared, served, and eaten at a lightning pace.  I, personally, love the Three Amigos Burrito with Chorizo sausage, and it's important not to miss their Thursday Empanada and Arepa special which is just as good if not better than the Tuesday dollar tacos.  Long story short you must stop by one of their 9 Charlotte area locations.  As for the NODA location, I've never had an issue with the wait staff, they are always extremely accommodating and I love the Latin ambiance of the interior.",

Placed my order online so everything was perfectly clear - upon arrival my food was late, and still somehow cold. Walked back to the car and realized one of my BYOB was only the inside filling placed in a take out box. Walked back in, they apologized and wrapped what was in the box, in a flour tortilla. After going back to my car - pulling it out to eat it completely falls apart not even wrapped what so ever. I spent close to $10 for a burrito for them to screw up 3 times. Completely fed up.",

    "text": "Normally I would have awesome things to say about this location but unfortunately my latest visit wasn't the best. It was a Saturday evening, busy and they seemed to be understaffed. I brought my friends from out of town as I typically do because it's a great place and I love NoDa. I ordered a Vegetarian Quesadilla (Cheese, Cilantro, Bell Pepper, Onion) and the cashier asked me specifically did I want meat and I said \"NO PROTEIN\", at least  twice in the conversation.  My order normally comes out pretty fast and my friends who ordered almost the whole menu got their stuff and had started to eat. I'm wondering where mine is at? I go up to counter and the cook is like yes I have yours coming out. Finally comes out and it looks very thick for it to only be veggies but I ended up taking a bite anyway, it tasted funny. I open it up and it's shredded chicken inside. I've been a vegetarian for awhile now and this was very very very disappointing, especially when I made the point to the cashier.  I ended up speaking to the manger who was very apologetic, which I appreciate however the excuse of \"It's really busy in here and she was flustered\", is unacceptable. Thank God I didn't have a food allergy. He refunded me for the quesadilla, which Yes was nice however in my opinion my whole order should have been returned as I had already left a tip since you have to pay prior to service. He remade my quesadilla which was also nice and I appreciate. My advice would be to have two cashiers on your busy days because the entire time I was there, the line to order was to the door as well as limited seating. If she is flustered due to the crowd then she doesn't need to be taking orders. Other than that, this place has good vibes and good food.",

My only criticism would be the salsa is a little watery for my taste. I'm a fan of chunkier salsa. However, the place was very clean and the ambience was  pleasant. The owner is very knowledgeable about Latin cuisine and the differences within the culture which plays a big role in his restaurant brand. The corn can I say it takes me back to LA mexican street food. Very good quality of food freshly made and you can taste it. I will go back and the owner Dave was the icing on the top.",

If you've been to Sabor before you know the Shabang, but for you newbies this joint is the place to go for authentic tacos in Charlotte. Plus they offer $1 tacos on Tuesday including dine in and carry out. $1 tacos include chicken, beef, veggie and black bean (served on corn tortillas). Plus, free chips with your checkin. Not many places can offer that.   Need salsa? Have no fear! Sabor offers a free salsa bar with a verity of different salsas. My favorites are the jalapeno pineapple and their medium salsa. Great on the chicken taco. The jalapeno green salsa is also delicious to put into their cheese dip. Trust me- you will thank me later.",

My hot bf was in the mood for seafood and he ordered the EPIC PROTEIN BOWL (for his \"gains\" hehehe) and he got extra shrimp and tilapia and it was pretty tasty.    I got the taco salad with grilled chicken and Mexican rice (bc quinoa gets stuck in my teeth) and it was delicious.  They even took the time to turn on the NBA All Star Game  great gesture.  And the halved avocado was fresh AF! I'm a stickler about my avocados....it was lovely.  I didn't give 5 stars bc the Pineapple Harbenero salsa lacked flavor.   I was pretty let down.",

On my first visit I tried the arepa and empanada which were both made vegetarian. This was a surprisingly dense but tasty meal. The second time I was there I got black bean and veggie tacos on $1 taco Tuesday. I was a little underwhelmed by the vegetarian tacos, especially compared to my prior meal. With a wide selection of Mexican eats, a great selection of salsas, and a fun atmosphere Sabor should be on the list for all those in the Charlotte area.",

We put in an order for take out - 2 quinoa avocado bowls, and paid extra for shrimp and avocado. When we got home, we realized we didn't get the chicken in one of the bowls. A phone call to Steve (assuming the manager?) and he offered to either make us a new bowl or comp the chicken and the kids meal we also bought. Very friendly and professional. Plus the bowls themselves were delicious - especially the grilled shrimp. Glad that Sabor has really turned things around and they're a great asset to the NoDa neighborhood.",

You stand in line initially to place your order - you'll then pick it up a few minutes later once it's prepared.    They offer a wide variety of latin street food - I really like the taco salad and burritos.  Their guacamole is super-tasty with large chunks of fresh avocado throughout - grab the large to share.    Once you place your order, check out the salsa bar in the back.  The salsas are arranged in order of heat - the further to the right you go, the more beer/soda you're going to need to quench that fire!    Every Tuesday is $1 taco night.  Unless you're just dying for $1 tacos (order at least 3), I'd recommend skipping this night.  Tuesday's are super-busy and really the tacos aren't the best things on their menu.",

I loved the salsa bar here. My favorites were the salsa verde as well as the pineapple salsa. The pineapple salsa had a kick to it, so it had twinges of sweet and hot playing off of one another. Chips (free with Yelp check-in when I was there) were fresh and crisp.   I ordered the Especial Burrito with chicken and Spanish rice. It wasn't filled with 90% rice, which is always an annoyance. Instead, there was an ample amount of chicken and beans. Very fresh hint of lime flavor. For the size of the burrito, I'd say the pricing was fair. I left stuffed.",

The empanadas are smaller, thinner pastry crust that's fried, but still delicious. I've also had the yuca fries which are awesome. Another neat thing about this place is the sauce station to the side. There are at least 7 varying degrees of intensity of sauces you can help yourself too. Very busy on Tuesdays ( $1 tacos).",

If you're looking for fast service, a good portion of food, delicious food of course, and a mean margarita, alllll for a super reasonable price. Sabor Latin Street Grill is the move. Loved this place! And honestly, it was perfect for a casual little date night, nothing fancy, just great food and good vibes.",

The nachos are huge and tasty. I also get their chips and salsa. It's been awhile since I e been because of the no where to park thing.",

    "text": "Genius!  The perfect restaurant for the area.  Great quick food at reasonable prices.  I love the fact that they have avocado quinoa bowls now too, a great way to put something healthy on your stomach before I night out drinking.  I'm not gonna lie, I havn't been a fan of Cabo Fish Taco for quite some time.  The quality has fallen off a little, while wait is longer and longer.  So having another spot to get tacos is more than welcome.  Don't get me wrong, I will still go to Jack Beagles for a wrap or mac and cheese, I'll still go to Growlers for some apps, and I'll still go to Boudreaux's or the public house for a more sit down experience.  But all that said, this place serves a niche that has been needed to be filled for quite some time.  I guess I should talk more about the food and booze.  I started writing this assuming everyone had been to the other location.  This restaurant is part of the 3 Amigo's and Salud beer shop family.  Anybody looking for basic Mexican food should be able to find something to make their heart content, but there is so much more.  Think more Central and South American street food.  Arepas, gorditas, empanadas, as well as your basic tacos and burritos.  Everything is good and reasonably priced.  On top of all this, they have a great beer selection.  I mean REALLY great, like probably better than any other Mexican restaurant in NC.  Stone, Ballast point, and tons of local beers.  I'll be back, many times over and over.",

After taking a bite and immediately noticing the poor quality, I politely asked the lady behind the counter to exchange, as the burrito wasn't edible. I was shocked when she told me that it wasn't a possibility since a bite had already been taken.   Bad food, even worse customer service. Save yourself the trouble and take your money elsewhere. Terrible.",

    "text": "This place really destroyed my expectations. Came here for taco Tuesday which i wasn't expecting top of the line tacos but at least something edible. I got 2 chicken tacos and 2 beef. Food came out pretty quickly and the guy that made them was super nice. The food however was cold and he had just made them which I was very confused about. I decided to put my complaints aside and just ate anyway. I ate 1 chicken taco which was alright would've been a lot better if it was hot and fresh. I decided I wanted chips with my food so I went back up and waited about 5 solid minutes before I was attended to. I don't mind the wait but when the workers are just socializing and looking at me without letting the cashier know there is someone that needs help is just disrespectful. I decided to dig into the beef one and let's just say I don't know what I was eating. The beef had to be the worst I've ever tasted in my life. I have no idea how they are serving it. My tacos were replaced with all chicken but needless to say I won't be returning here. Absolutely no effort was put into the service so I'll just save my money.",

Luckily he checked or half of us wouldn't have gotten our meal. Finally got the rest of the food a few mins later. Horrible service considering we ordered ahead even. We were so excited about this place too. Bummer.",

    "text": "Hello, Sabor. Welcome to the new 'hood.   This new Sabor location is, IMO, a lot better than their Elizabeth one. Feels like there's twice as many tables/chairs, even though I'm sure I'm exaggerating.   As always, Sabor doesn't disappoint. $1 #TacoTuesday is the long standing real MVP. I just learned this, but they'll let you \"upgrade\" to the premium tacos for an additional $1 (thus, making the \"premiums\" $2/each).   I've tried all of the regulars, as well as the Al Pastor. Personally, I think the ground beef and shredded chicken are the best. I wasn't impressed with the al pastor in the least bit. I'm a queso kinda guy ... so this would be my \"must improve\" item for Sabor. I've gotten it 3 times, and 2 of the 3 times it's been extremely thin/runny. It always takes the same (I guess that's a plus), but I much  prefer it when it's thicker. The mo' cheese on a chip, the better.   Protip: Taco Tuesday is also valid for take out.",
