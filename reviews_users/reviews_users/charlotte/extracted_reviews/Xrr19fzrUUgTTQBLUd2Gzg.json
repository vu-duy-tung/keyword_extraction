I have always got the French Dip and never once have I been disappointed. The chili cheese fries are also very tasty. Small little hole in the wall restaurant, that offers great food, has friendly service, awesome cookies, and awesome sandwiches. Looking forward to my next Charlotte trip just for the Dip.",

I love their reubens, and their fries are always hot, crispy and plentiful.  Other great picks - BLT, cheeseburger, chicken salad, bratwurst.  I love Rusty's and always recommend it to my family and friends if we're looking for a simple place to have a lunch or small dinner.  My dad discovered it several years ago while my mother and I were shopping for my wedding dress and I'm so glad he did!!",

    "text": "Rusty's is the kind of diner/hole in the wall joint that always serves consistency. The menu isn't ground breaking. They're not going for a Michelin Star here and the goal is to serve good, consistent food day in and day out.   Rusty's is quaint and humble from the outside. (Beware of the construction happening in Quail Corners) Just a few tables with umbrellas, a small neon sign and a basic white spelling of \"Rusty's\" above the building. The interior is great. Almost like a flashback from the 90's. Business cards all over the wall to your left, cooler of drinks, large menu next to the ordering window, tons of copies of National Geographic in the dining area....Just a great little joint.   The menu is pretty standard deli style. Sandwiches, soups, potatoes, salads. My wife and I usually go for a double-decker pb&j but sometimes we venture out of our mainstay. The potatoes are rather large with a gratuitous amount of toppings. Not my favorite, but worth a try if you're hungrier than usual. I love their Reuben. Not a huge NY style stack of pastrami. Just a medium-sized 'wich with sauerkraut and Thousand Island. Simple and familiar.   I love Rusty's. A great local, hole in the wall that serves the same dependable food day in and day out. Thanks, Rusty's!",

I finally stopped and I am glad I did.  I thought it was gonna be just another boring restaurant but I was pleasantly surprised when the first two things to welcome me were a community board and the cooler with a passable craft beer selection.  We grabbed a couple of beers, ordered the special (Bacon cheeseburger & fries for $4.99) and sat. Our food came out fast and everyone was very pleasant. I even struck a conversation with the guy who brought my burger about Android phones.  Food was great! The burger had that freshly made look and taste, delicious! The fries were a little dry and could have used more salt but they were good overall.  I really liked the atmosphere, very relaxed and informal. Great little place to spend a Saturday afternoon.  Definitely will be going back.",

I got pasta salad on the side which was flavorless and soaked in oil and a double chocolate cookie which was a yummy end to my meal!  My guests got a tuna burger and a cheese, bacon, mushroom burger with a side of fries. I can't vouch for the taste of those, but they ate it all, along with a slice of carrot cake (she said it was great!) and a toffee cookie!

They had no trouble finding me outside (probably because not many people were there).

I definitely recommend Rusty's if you're looking for a good burger but don't want to spend a lot of money.",

I feel like the clientele they cater to is a skinless type of crowd if you know what I mean.  They do serve bottled beer which is something you do not see at many deli's.    The staff is always courteous and definitely likes to take care of their customers.  There is a pac-man machine in the back but if you are not careful, it will take your quarter.",

Really popular with all the nearby highschool kids from South Meck and for good reason- it's great food at a fair price. Would definitely recommend it to anyone that asked me for a great burger, my personal favorite being their bacon cheeseburger. Has a hole-in-the-wall atmosphere to it and is family owned, something that is becoming too rare of a thing nowadays",

    "text": "I like Rusty's deli - the food has always been fresh and tastes great.  It is a Charlotte institution & I remember going back in the 80s.    However, it can be a little tricky getting in and out during peak times -  especially on Saturdays.  Be prepared to wait for a table on a busy Saturday and especially if you have more than 2 or 3 people in your party.   Unfortunately, the crowded little space they occupy detracts from the overall dining experience.  But, when it is not too hot & humid outdoors, there is outdoor seating where you don't feel as claustrophobic.  The salads are good here as are the spuds - my fav is the turkey & cheese... yum-o!  Despite the challenges of the small space and awkward layout, I would still recommend Rusty's for someone looking for an independently owned deli with a little local flavor.",

You grab your drink while waiting in line to place an order, then you order at the counter.  You walk around the side to pay and they give you a number.  Put that number on your table, and your food will be delivered shortly.  No wait service, just fast service.  I prefer eating out on the patio if there is space available.  There is quite a variety of choices.  From burgers to french dips.  Bratwurst to meatball subs.  Salads, stuffed potatoes, and even some vegetarian options.  I've tried it all and never had a bad meal.  I know this review sounds more like an ad for the place, but I really have nothing bad to say.  Its a chill little spot that puts out great food at a reasonable price.  Kind of unheard of on park rd.",

The bratwurst was hefty enough to serve as dinner!  I also love the eclectic decor with National Geographic magazines available to read. All in new condition! I definitely will be returning and plan to go thru the menu one item at a time. Well worth it!!",

You go in and straight ahead of you is where someone takes your order.  Then you go around a corner grab your drink, get a number and pay.  Grab a seat and someone will bring out your order.  I sat outside and shortly after a friendly girl brought out my food.   I tried the reuben with mustard with fries and drink.  The sandwich was just ok to me.  There was too much mustard on it and the bread was quite greasy.  The fries were a light golden color but the taste was blah.  They were soft and mushy inside.  Only Ketchup could save them.  So maybe I should come here and try something else but my search for a good rueben in Charlotte will continue.",

It's definitely a hole in the wall type place as other reviews have said,but don't let the outside fool you. Inside is clean and well taken care of. It quickly filled up as I was waiting for my food so this definitely was a very popular place. Their menu consists of hot and cold sandwiches, soups and salads. I ended up with the Carolina Club and a cup of cream of broccoli soup.   After you order you walk around, grab a drink and then pay for your food. It flowed very well. Custom service was fine and they were very accommodating to a first timer lol.   My food was really good. Nice ratio of meat to bread. I have to make a special comment about the bacon. It was cooked perfectly. thick cut and cooked to crispy but not burnt. Soup was good as well.  Well seasoned and a thick soup as a creamed soup should be. There are definitely other things on this menu that I would like to try. I will say that the 5-10 customers behind me had one of two sandwiches, a phillysteak of some sort or the meatball sandwich. I will be back to try other sandwiches.",

I have a lot of great memories in this place, and it makes me happy that they're still around and doing well for themselves!",

Sandwiches and other platters, nothing quite \"New York\" style.  I chose the Turkey Reuben. Grilled and topped with sauerkraut the way Reubens are supposed to be but the amount of turkey in there just didn't meet (meat?) my expectations.  Mrs. chose the \"mixed cheese baked potato\". Lots and lots of cheese on here and the potato was nice and fluffy but WOW was it hotter than Hades.  Overall, pretty good. I think the Reuben is better at Katz's though.",

We also got a side of fries which was plenty for two people and a cookie to split. Not to mention a couple of local bottled beers!  When you walk in, you're immediately looking at the counter to order. To your right is a giant menu. There is a ton to choose from, so take your time. You'll also be by a few coolers full of bottled/canned sodas, beer and waters--they have a great selection.   After placing your order you walk around the corner to pay and grab any last minute items (chips, cookies etc.). You can see the kitchen from behind the counter so you get a real deli feel. There is plenty of seating indoors, or a few tables outside!   The customer service was fantastic and the food was really taste. Highly recommend, I'll definitely go back.",

It was very crowded and there's no flow to the restaurant, If it's your first time you'll be confused as they're not very welcoming.   My burger was cooked well done as it's the only option and was not good. The French Dip was better and the fries weren't bad.   A burger should ALWAYS come with fries! A LA CARTE menus for fast food is beyond ridiculous! The prices quickly add up as they nickel and dime their customers. The tables outside are very dirty as is the ground, full of food!",

They have the best chicken soup that I've ever had in this country ( I am from Brazil). The soup was so good I even ordered one to go. My husband ordered a French Dip that was divine and they have daily fresh baked cookies that are to die for. Prices are okay, service was fine, place is quite big and did not take long to bring our food.  I can't wait to go back and try different things from their menu. Highly recommend!!!",

There was a good amount of corn beef and sauerkraut.  They ask if you want spicy mustard or thousand island.  I ordered with the thousand island, and quite honestly, I couldn't even tell if there was any on the sandwich--I like a bit more of the thousand island.  The fries, also super hot.  I was not familiar with the order process.  You stand in line to place order at window, but they bring your food out to your table, which I liked.  Overall, OK.  I may try again, but will ask for extra thousand island.",

Unfortunately, as a result of the health concerns and lack of customer service I experienced, I will be taking my business elsewhere moving forward.   I ordered a burger to go; half way through eating, I bit hard into something tough and metallic. When I spit out, I realized there was a 1/2\" screw in my burger. Aside from the sanitary issues, a sharp, foreign object presents a multitude of potential health risks.   When I drove back to the restaurant, a staff member took the burger and explained that neither the manager nor owner were present. In response, I asked for the half eaten burger to be returned so that I could follow up with management later. The staff member then refused to return the burger and would not allow me to take a picture (fortunately, I had the foresight to take one before returning to Rusty's- it is attached).  The owner arrived shortly thereafter and mumbled a half apology. I left my contact information with the owner, but to date, he has made no effort to contact me. I will be filing a complaint with the health department and will be scheduling an appointment with my dentist.   I will never return to this business due to the way this was handled.",

    "text": "For 20 years, this South Charlotte deli/grille, nestled among the ever-changing stores at Quail Corners Shopping Center, has served up the area's best Angus burgers and corned beef Reubens. Except for its prices, it is amazing how little has changed over that time. Equally amazing is how often it is ignored by the media when the city's best burgers are rated. We regulars don't care though, it's already crowded enough.  You order at the front counter after perusing the menu choices on the wall to your right. You then proceed around the corner and grab your drink then move on to pay. Within minutes your meal is enthusiastically delivered piping hot to your table in its narrow alley-like eating area. Fries are simple yet fabulous as are all of its sides. Even its cookies are pretty darned good.  Back to the burgers though... long time locals know them for what they are, the absolute best burgers in the area. Served up simply, on a buttered then grilled bun, they focus on what matters most which is the Angus beef.  The Rubens and cheese steak Hoagies are served up just as simply and honestly. Crushed ice sodas only enhance the experience.   Service is friendly and hustles to get your food to you hot and tasty.The joint is always clean and well managed. Is it a five star joint amongst comprable daily grills? You bet it is! It's also a Gotta Try, but when you discover that it is all I say it is, do me a favor and keep it to yourself.",

You will stand in a line to order at a counter, and then stand in another cafeteria-style line to check out and receive your order.

Sandwiches don't come with anything but a pickle, so you have to order fries on the side if you want. After you order, you continue down the aisle to the cash register - passing by chips, fountain soda, sweet tea, etc.. You pay and get a number, and then they bring your food to your table.

But I figured why not maybe they ordered the wrong thing. Plus, I wanted something different from my usual Subway. Anyway first off thee decor is a bit off putting because its like the house of mirrors. Some of the other reviewers said this was a Charlotte institution, but I haven't been here long enough to know that. I just know they need to change the inside because it's a bit creepy. So, I ordered the chicken cheesesteak, fries and some coleslaw. This is not authentic if that is what you are looking for. the cheesesteak was soggy. I got mushrooms which were runny. What was more disappointing was that the chicken was like steakums and it was one layer of chicken on top of a glob of mayo, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. Basically there was no chicken plus it tasted like shoe leather. The fries were ok. Not as crispy as others stated and they needed SALT! I didn't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross.  The coleslaw was full of mayo, so I didn't eat all of that either.  The pickle was good even though it was really salty, but I like pickles so I'm bias. I can say I probably won't go there again and I should have just gone to Subway. Take it or leave it.",

Only drawback is that we wish it was open on Sundays.  A rarity in Charlotte: a great, independent, non-chain delli/ grill.",

    "text": "We eat here on a semi-regular basis and over the years have NEVER been disappointed.  Love the cheesteak sandwiches and the grilled tuna, which some may consider a bit pricey for a sandwich, but it's the size of a small filet mignon and always tender and gently seasoned.   Add a side of their generous portions of fries, enough for two (order extra crispy) and you have a very filling and quick meal served by friendly folks.",

    "text": "I stopped at Rusty's Deli & Grille for lunch on a Saturday because of the reviews here.  Overall I'd recommend Rusty's, but there are better places to eat.  The restaurant is long and narrow and when I came in was very busy.  The ordering system is very convoluted.  You wait in line to order at a window.  The person at the window though was also making sandwiches so there was a wait, about 30 seconds, between each group to order.  The menu board is on the sidewall of the hallway  (parallel to the line) so you can't really see it until you get up to the front of the line to order.  It would have been better to place it above the order window (perpendicular to the line).  And you thought you'd never use geometry after you got out of high school.  Then you head around the corner to the left to another line to get your drinks and place your order again at the cashier and pay.  The layout of the place kind funnels people this way, but why do I have to order twice?  Maybe this is so they can start working on your order and have it ready when you go to pay.  I was lucky to grab a table as I witnessed several parties hovering nearby looking for a place to sit.  If you have more than two people in your party I recommend that after make your first order you send someone to snag  a table while the other goes to pay.  I ordered a cheese steak sandwich and fries.  It took a while to get my food.  You would think they would have started working on it when I first placed my order, but that was not the case.  With the volume of people in the place I anticipated a wait, but it seemed to take longer than it should to get my food.  The cheese steak sandwich was OK, nothing special, but it was hot off the grill.  I should have known not to expect too much when the menu said it came with lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Toppings that are fine for a burger but that should never be mentioned in the same sentence as a cheese steak.  I left them off of my cheese steak.  The fries on the other hand were great.  They were thick cut, hot & crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Overall nothing spectacular, the fries come close, but good hot food.  The tab came to $10.46 for sandwich, fries and drink, which is not too unreasonable.",

    "text": "This place is GREAT if you're looking for a tasty, quick lunch like a sandwich, burger, or salad. I've been here twice so far. The service is real quick, the food is delicious, and the staff are friendly. Everything is convenient. Fountain drinks are self-served as well as some of the sides (such as pasta salads, fruit cups, etc). Haven't eaten inside yet but I would like to some time, because the place is nice and cozy. A bit short on space, but the interior decor is fun and a good place to eat with a couple other friends. The only thing I'd say is that there isn't a whole lot of variety on toppings for a sandwich or burger, usually just lettuce and tomato. Pretty typical stuff, nothing really \"Rusty-unique.\" But...maybe I just don't know yet, need to visit more!",
