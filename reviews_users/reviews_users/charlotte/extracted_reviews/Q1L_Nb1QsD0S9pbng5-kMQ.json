    "text": "This was my first experience at Portofino's and it was a good one. I was there with a large group from work. The service was friendly, informative & quick. We started with some apps., mozzarella sticks, calamari & bruschetta. All were top notch. The bruschetta was a little heavy on the garlic but this is an Italian place. I ordered one of the specials for the evening, surf & turf, Fillet mignon and shrimp over a tomato based risotto. The risotto was fantastic, nice & creamy. One of my co workers had the chicken parm which he said was tremendous. Next time, I'll stick to their specialties, pasta and pizza. I ordered the tiramisu for dessert. Nice presentation and really a great way to end a meal. I'll be back for another go at this place.",

The wait staff is great, but the food and management (manager has been rude on multiple occasions) is subpar. The only reason we have ordered from there more than once is because it is walking distance from our town home.",

We had to ask her to repeat everything several times. She didn't seem to be properly trained bringing out one dish wrong n didn't know the prices of the special's. Then the food came, my soup was watery n tasteless. My veal was rubbery n the whole dish was bland. My husband's seafood dish was so just ok n the friends orders were all messed up which she did not offer to correct. We were embarrassed to say the least after telling them how great this place was.

    "text": "So I decided to go to Portifinos (on Arsley) because I had been to the one on Park and really enjoyed it! The service was great- the food excellent!   Unfortunately the three other times I have gone to this Portifinos I have had literally the opposite experience (although these times have all been for lunch and the time at Park was for dinner)  The first time was on my birthday (I know what a bummer) ...My co-workers and I split a large NY style pepperoni pizza and for dessert I took a piece of tiramisu back to work with me. The pizza was less than ok- very salty, super oily . The thinness was correct- but it just wasn't right (I should have known better being from NY but I figured my dinner was so good the time before)....The dessert was WAY worse, so disappointing! I had to throw it out because the cream had gone bad ....it was just awful.  The second time I went to this location was also for a work lunch...this time I went back to the original pasta dish I ordered the first time I went to dinner on Park. The pasta noodles were mush - and my co-workers had a similar bad experiences with their chicken (on pizza, and a sub) being overly dry. To make matters even worse our service was awful- and we sat waiting a very long time for our check ( a two hour lunch here is a bit much-it wasn't busy!)   the third time was unfortunately not a charm...I had the chicken parm dish- which  was at best mediocre.  Go to the one on Park if you really want to try it...I won't be going back.",

This particular Portofino's is alot smaller and is very well hidden from view (Pretty much everything in Ayresley Village is). I don't think I've tried anything here that I disliked. They have a great variety for every taste. I especially love their pink sauce on anything! The price is great for the flavor and portion size that you receive. We usually dine here on the weekdays and there's usually a good crowd of people stopping by for a business dinner. The only negetive would have to be their waitors/hostess's. Not always the most personable people, but their definately not rude :)",

Now, I don't eat many clams but I had said that they better be careful if they eat all those...they smelled rotten! I was told it tasted about as good as it smelled unfortunately. As far as the eggplant parm, it wasn't very warm or tasty so I would best describe this as better quantity over quality.

    "text": "My friend and I dinned at Portofino's yesterday on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It was my first experience at the Italian eatery.   A couple near us complained to the waitress that since the lady's entree never came out, despite the gentleman had finished his entree; they were cancelling the entree and requesting the check.   The waitress apologized and issued the gentleman the check.  He paid and just as they were getting up to leave, the waitress hurried over and said that she had forgotten to charge them for the accompanying side salad that the lady had apparently eaten, which comes with the entree.  The lady went ballistic on the waitress saying \"Are you crazy, you want to charge me for the salad that comes with the entree that you never brought me?!\"  As the couple walked out (without paying for the salad), the waitress charged after them with a few words of her own (out of my earshot, despite my best efforts...LOL).  It was like watching a show with our dinner...quiet entertaining.   We had the same waitress.  I don't think she was able to recover from the other incident.  We had asked for warm bread since the loaf she brought out was delivered cold, which took so long that we asked another waitress for the bread.  Our entree took a very long time too as did a nearby couple who was there before us.  A third couple, serviced by the same waitress had waited at least 10 minutes before they asked another waitress to take their drink order.  There were only three other tables of dinners on our side.  I'm not sure how many were on the other side of the divided restaurant.  However, service that day was not the best.  Now to the food!  I ordered the chicken in Gorgonzola sauce with mushrooms and garlic.  Now that sounds like a very flavorful dish, doesn't it?  Imagine my disappointment when I had to douse it with salt and pepper two or three times throughout the meal.  My sweetie had Chicken Carbonara.  Before he tasted his dish, I passed him the salt and pepper and he said, \"Oh really, it's like that?\" and re-seasoning his food too (as did another nearby diner).  Neither of us are big salters.  The chicken in both of our dishes was a bit tough and just really lacked \"oomph\".  On the upside, the portions were huge (If only you wanted to take them home.).  We both rated the food as 2  1/2 to 3 stars.  Hey, maybe it was just an off night for the kitchen and THE waitress (or maybe not).",

The soup I had was a bit salty and reminded me of something out of a can. The white sangria is much better than the red.  Service was great.",

I cant recall the name of the dish I had but it was sauteed shrimp with sundried tomatoes and mushroom in a creamy marinara or \"vodka\" sauce on a bed of linguini.  It was perfection.    My hubby had the Florentina pizza which was a tad greasy, but still good.  It had chicken, ricotta, pesto and something else I cant remember.  I recommend this place.",

    "text": "I have been to several of the Portofinos in Charlotte including Park Road, Eastway Drive, and Arboretum.  So, when we found ourselves in the Arsley area, we thought this would be a good place to stop. Prior to arriving, we called to make sure they were open for lunch.  The guy who answered the phone was abrupt and almost rude.  Not a good sign, but I ignored it and we proceeded to go.    Overall, I would say this location is not as good as Eastway or Arborteum.  I think the service was not as good, and the food I ordered wasn't as good either.  Since it was lunch time and I wasn't that hungry, I decided to go for a salad and a slice of cheese pizza.  Both were ok, but nothing especially exciting.   Still, it is not a bad choice for the area. I just wouldn't go out of my way to drive to this location.",

    "text": "The place was packed on a Saturday Night. and they have good reviews. so the average local likes this place. Now when it comes to Italian food (or Mexican food) with me - I am not your average local. I was born, raised and FED Italian food my entire childhood. I come from a big Italian family, most everyone cooks, including me. so read my review with that in mind. It was ok food. I wouldn't say it was great. MAYBE I could say it was good, but then it might sound as though I am approving how they make the Italian dishes. And I do not. For starters, we ordered an antipasto dish that was suppose to include Mortadella - an expensive Italian ham. It did not. It had Food Lion brand ham. It also had processed turkey roll on the plate. You dont ever under any circumstance put turkey, never mind turkey roll, on an Italian antipasto plate. period. Then came my Shrimp Scampi entree. I wasn't impressed. I couldn't taste any garlic in it at all. I couldn't taste any butter. The lemon you could taste. And my fettuccine I am not so sure was fettuccine...you know those noodles you get in Cambells chicken soup? I got that.  So while the service was good, and the place packed, I have to tell you the food was ok at best.  If you are from a part of the US where Italians live in abundance and you have been eating good Italian food, you may want to skip this place. If you think Pizza hut is perfectly acceptable food, come on in, you'll love this place.",

    "text": "Wow!  Please stay far away from this establishment if you have any food allergies.  They will RIP-YOU-OFF AND PRICE GAUGE YOU!  Tonight, I went to have dinner.  I asked all the right questions about being Gluten and Dairy Free.  The waitress was completely illiterate about the composition and the ingredients of the meal.  Not once did she offer to walk-in the kitchen and ask the chef.  A very nice man-older, stepped in and explained they can make any chicken dish grilled and add the sauce.  Never once did they state if would be an up-charge of $5.00.  My meal arrived and it was 1/4 cup of gluten-free pasta and one thin cutlet of chicken, less than 4 ounces.  There were no vegetables at all.  The chicken was dry and over-cooked.  There was no seasoning at all.  I was starving, so I ate my very small portion of food.  When the bill arrived, I was charged $19.50 for my meal.  I think I fell off my chair.   Food Cost Break-Down- 1 box of Gluten-Free Pasta ($1.89) and 1 breast of chicken 4 ounces-$6.99 lb at Whole Foods.  Usually you receive 2 full breast( 4 cutlets)- Total Value of Meal: $ 4.00.  I went to the front desk and she sent me over to the owner.  I explained to him that I was never told about the up-charge or even the very expensive meal that I was about to be charged for.  He stated \"Gluten-Free Pasta\" is very expensive.  Is this an excuse to lie to a customer.  Does he not realize when you ask for \"Gluten Free\" that you are aware of your allergy and you are aware of the cost of food.  I do go food shopping every week for the last 9 years.  He just was rude and said he would adjust the bill.  The waitress came back with a check for $18.50 for my meal. He took $1.00 off.   This was deplorable and disgusting.  You mark your food cost up over 90%.  Shame on You!!!  You had the opportunity to fix it as the owner and you choose to coat your pockets with my hard earned money.  You are awful man!  I hope everyone who reads this will boycott your restaurant.  You are greedy and your food was AWFUL!",

I ordered veal Marsala, the first dish was wrong(I was brought veal parmesan) sent it back, second time they brought me chicken Marsala, I sent that back. The third time they got it right but in an attempt to push the food out quick, the dish was bland, sauce was watery and the veal was tough as shoe leather. By this time I just wanted to leave, and when I got the bill they still charged for the so-called side salad that came with the meal. Really!?! Worst birthday dinner, EVER. Will not be back.",

Server wiped the table/menus down with a mildewed rag. Menus and table reeked for the rest of the meal. Asked to be re-sat, but apparently there was no space. Food was nice. Second visit...no smell of decay, but the food was microwaved to a temp hotter than then sun. Also, I'm not a fan of canned chicken. Meal tasted like a school lunch I had in 1978. I think I paid $1.50 for that meal in '78 and that was about what this was worth.  If you're a fan of the sub-par, you'll love this place.",

I would say the food was ok. Not bad, but ok. The reason for this is because some of the items we received seemed to be warmed up in the microwave - some of my coworkers and I came to this conclusion because the meatballs were very hot to the point where you couldn't bite into the meatball without burning your tongue.  I ordered the veal parm with angel hair pasta. All Tasted good. The service was great considering we had a rather large group.   5 stars for service  5 stars for parking  3 stars for taste and quality of food 5 stars for proximity to hotel 4 stars for price",

I ordered the margharita pizza assuming I couldn't go wrong but I did...I went very very wrong.  The sauce on the pizza was water and almost flavorless, the crust was decent but the pizza itself was very doughy and soggy.  I couldn't taste any basil and the mozzarella wasn't fresh.  No fresh tomatoes, just a runny sauce.  Not very good at all.  Two others ordered the penne vodka (not on the menu) and added chicken.  The chicken looked like it was on the floor in the back of the restaurant, collecting dirt, getting stepped on and then heated up in a microwave to just ensure it was nice and shriveled.  Rubbery, tough, flavorless.  Gross.  The vodka sauce was again sub par.  Just not good!!  One of my other dining partners got the clam sauce and he said it was okay but nothing that great.    Our starter salads were decent but again just not great.  The bread served prior the meals was okay.    We weren't offered dessert but the desserts in the cooler looked old and stale.    Overall, I would never make the trip to come to this particular location again.  Others mentioned how great it is at the Park Road location so I am willing to give that one a try.",

    "text": "First, read my review for Providence Road location.......well, only if you want to do so!  After eating at Providence Road locale on Monday, and although my lovely daughter ( a Charlotte resident) advised us that the sauce here tends to be watery, honey was insistent on returning to this location since the white pizza of his dreams hailed from Ayrsley!    As others have mentioned, parking may be an issue if you are not there pretty early.   Nicer ambiance than Providence Road, but for us it is ALL about the food. Server was Chantel, very pleasant.  Almost as good as Stafford at Providence Road.    The bread was OMG good.  No burnt bottoms this night!  We both started with the Caesar salad.  Good BUT not sure if the owner has tried to Americanize it or what, but NO parmesan cheese......mozzarella....really?  But the dressing was great, the croutons were plentiful (although I didn't think they were house made, which would have been a plus based on that heavenly manna).  Honey stuck with the Zuppa di Pesce based on the Providence Road experience.  First problem for him was NO rigatoni, although available at the other location.  Lovely daughter had warned us that she and the hubs had almost quit this location for the Park Road one (we didn't eat there.....yet!) due to what she thought was watered down sauce.  As soon as honey's dish was set in front of him, we realized the problem......pasta basically not drained!  I wish I had taken a picture, because there was a swimming pool below his food.  Sauce was just meh (as Yelp puts it). I did take one shrimp, didn't even care to get the others.  Even after tilting his plate and pouring water into the bowl meant for shells half full of water, there was still water.  He had to make do with penne, or ziti, heck, I'm not sure, but there was about a pound of THAT!    On to me!  I ordered the Stuffed Eggplant which did NOT come with what I consider the staple of every Italian meal, pasta.  However, I was only able to finish half my plate.  This is their version of Eggplant Rollatini, kinda, sorta.  It comes with that same ham from the chicken of Monday night, so I got spinach......now that was some good stuff!  I notice another reviewer says it haunts her dreams!  I can understand.  Strangely, MY red sauce was great.  So, I cannot understand why the honey's sauce on his dish was so blah.....oh, it was that gallon of water!    Again, he got a cannoli (he managed to skip the spumoni and espresso this trip!), and was not as happy with it.  The reason, you ask?  Because they tried to chef it up.  This fellow just wants a cannoli with the filling....he doesn't need a decorated plate drizzled with a ton of Hershey's syrup!    I will mention that the white pizza from heaven came from this locale last year, so he may be willing to order pizza from here!  He walked outside to enjoy the sun while I visited the facilities.......so I mentioned on my way out to what appeared to be a manager that the staff might want to drain the pasta.  She was pleasant BUT said we would need to mention it.  Now, I'm a little confused......having complaints of watered down sauces, and we might need to mention draining the pasta?  Oh, well....Providence Road and Stafford for our server for the win!",

Now I may be a little biased because I grew up in an Italian family and ate homemade Italian food from my family along with my own cooking. The atmosphere when sitting down was okay, service was quick and the waitress was very nice. The food was subpar for me. I ordered gnocchi baked with mozzarella cheese and a meatball. The sauce tasted like chopped tomatoes that were overly seasoned. Don't even get me started on the meatball. It tasted like a mushy, bland bowel movement my dog may leave in the backyard. To me, this place has typical southern Italian taste and I have yet to find an Italian restaurant like I grew up with. I give it three stars for the service, but 1 for the food.

We sat at our table for at least 10 - 15 minutes with no one checking on us then the server showed up smelling like she had just smoked a carton with Joe Camel. She stunk. Took our drink order and didn't really have very good table skills. The questions were unintelligent and what I would expect from someone offering me \"fries with that\"....She came back with the drinks after making a few pits stops along the way. Keep in mind we were the only table she was serving.  Placed our order and while waiting for said order our drinks went dry. All the while she was standing by the kitchen doing much of nothing.   Our order arrived and it was OK. $15 for Chicken Parm...and it was OK. Not worth the $15 price tag. The menu is huge and complicated. Way too big. They need to trim it up.  Again the drinks went dry. All while about 3 or 4 of wait staff sat around doing nothing. Trash all over the floor no service and all of them sitting down doing nothing.   So on the way out the door I mentioned this to the \"manager\" and he didn't seems upset or concerned and at no point apologized for the crappy service. I drop over $20 per person and all the guy could say was he would look into it.   Won't be going back ever. There is a problem there and they don't care to fix it so I won't be back.

O-M-G!!! It was delish! To make matters worse, when we picked up our puzza,they had a display case of enticing Italian desserts, and my sister and I indulged in a limoncello and a sorbet. It was delectable!!! The food was amazing. Check it out! You won't be disappointed.",

We have been eating at Portofino's for years and after moving away from the Charlotte area we were having a family birthday get together and were looking forward to eating there again.  Although the pizza is still the BEST in the area, the rest of the meals we ate were very disappointing.  The service was very poor.  Our waitress was hard to understand and seemed very disinterested.  The calamari was tough, the white sangria was more like fruit punch than sangria, the clam chowder was extremely salty and more like broth than a chowder.  The main courses ordered by my girlfriend and me were very unsatisfying.  The veal was tough and the linguini with clams that I ordered was almost too salty to eat.  Also, for this type of nice italian restaurant I found it odd that the parmesan is in a shaker bottle and not freshly grated at the table.  We won't be going back again!",

While they have the signature italian dishes, such as manicotti, calzones, strombolis, etc., they also have a pretty good lunch pasta menu. This pasta menu allows you to choose your noodle, sauce type, & some other options, letting you truly get the type of pasta you want.  So while I really can't pinpoint why this place just doesn't do it for me, it might have something to do with the atmosphere. For the lunch crowd, I don't think it needs to be so dark inside, like I'm eating at a fine Italian restaurant for dinner. If they brightened up the place & made it a little less formal, I'd probably go here a little more often. But that's me, so make your judgment on your own. And like I said before, the food is really quite tasty so there isn't anything wrong in the most important department (taste).",

I tried the pizza for the first time the other day and I think that will be my go-to menu item at this place because it is excellent.  The other dishes they serve are usually good too: the bread is warm and delicious and they load tons of cheese onto their dishes.  It isn't the healthiest place.  There are not many great dining options in the nearby area, but I would say that this is one of the better options in the neighborhood.    The only problem I have encountered there is when I tried to place a takeout order via phone.  I was ordering for 3 people and the individual I was speaking to was not repeating the order back correctly (we went through it a couple of times and I asked if there was someone else that could take my order and they either didn't understand me or didn't want someone else to take my order??).  I decided it would be easier to go to the restaurant and just order live, but the order still came out wrong.  I got them to correct and switch it out, but I had to wait a little longer than I would have liked.  They were semi-friendly about it and apologetic when it came out wrong.  I just wanted dressing on the side and a salad without olives...",

    "text": "Whoa, Portofino's, what happened?  I had not eaten at his (or any other location) in at least a year, but this place is not as good as it once was.  They used to bring out great soft warm fresh bread.  The 3 loaves of bread they brought out for our group of 8 were all charred.  A co-worker got the canneloni - it looked good until she took a couple of bites of one of the two pieces and it was cold in the middle.  It was like it had been refrigerated or frozen and just reheated :(  I can do better than that by getting frozen pasta at Sam's Club and for a whole cheaper.  They brought it back but all they did was dump a lot of warm sauce on it so it was still cold in the middle.  Another coworker ordered chicken with her pasta (which all of us heard) and they did not put it on. A small lunch salad now costs an extra $2.50 when served with an entree when not that long ago it was $1.  I understand the need to raise prices due to food costs, but this is mostly lettuce here, plus it's also an add-on. Our waitress was nice, but we were there for 90 minutes and our waters were refilled only once.  They also added on 18% for mediocre service so that was another disappointment.  There were a couple of positives.  My tortellini with chicken and Gorgonzola was pretty tasty, as were my coworkers' pizza and grilled chicken salad.  They gave my co-worker a surprise tiramisu because they felt bad about her canneloni.  Unfortunately, she doesn't like the taste of coffee, so she didn't eat it.    The overall experience was definitely \"meh\" so it will likely be a while before I give it another shot.  I feel a little bad, because almost everyone there seems nice, but the food and service have to improve a little bit.",

The service was good but the food was not as good as the one we get in Greenville. The dinner rolls was just bread sliced with butter for us to smear instead of the mouth watering dinner rolls dipped in garlic and olive oil. I ordered for Shrimp Fradiavolo and hubby went for Chicken Marsala. My entree was good but Chicken marsala was just bland. Next time we are Charlotte we are going to try other Italian places for sure.",

    "text": "You get one opportunity to make a first impression and the one I got is one a company should strive to never let a customer have. Let's start with parking: it's terrible. You have to park in the parking garage and there's no covered walkway so try not to come if it's raining.   The restaurant was warm inside. We overheard another table request to move due to it so it wasn't just us. The table next to us had an annoyed look on their face when we came in, along with empty plates. I can assume their experience was as... wonderful... as ours.  About 8 minutes later, a server finally came for a drink order. We offered our meal order too as we already had plenty of time to decide. He then turned to the annoyed couple, who promptly asked for their check.   He returned with their check and bused another table. He collected their payment and brought their receipt along with our drinks (teas, not alcohol, so why he didn't bring them with the check for the table next to us is beyond me).  Bread was brought to the table, warm, so that was on point.  Then the meals came. What was ordered: 1- chicken parmesan and 1- chicken franchese. Respectfully, different dishes. At the time of ordering, we were not asked for our preference on pasta, which they give 5 options.   I had the chicken franchese. As he placed my order in front of me, he confirmed \"chicken parmesan,\" which I said no, I had the franchese. The plate was still put in front of me and I had to say 3x \"this is not what I ordered\" before he looked at his notes to confirm.  He took the plate and retreated to the kitchen. He came back and said my meal would be out in a few seconds (hopefully they somehow weren't bringing me raw chicken). I asked for the manager in turn.   The manager seemed nonchalant, like the fact that the other person ate their meal to avoid it getting cold and, by the time my order would arrive, they would be finished. I asked for it to be boxed.  He never mentioned comping the meal, the server did when he brought the check.   When I got home and finally got to eat my meal, it was less than desirable, clearly an entree the chefs do not know how to properly prepare.  Like I said, terrible first impression. We won't be back.",

You know that taste of a beer that has been chilled, got warm and chilled again?  Bingo!  I was with a customer so I didn't complain.  Never a good thing to do at a customer dinner.

I always take it as an encouraging sign when I can easily find a half dozen options on a menu that I'd readily choose to eat. It was not hard to imagine myself fabricating reasons to come back for lunch and/or dinner again.  We started dinner with stuffed mushrooms filled with crabmeat. A perfectly yummy way to start dinner.  My wife ordered the special for that evening -- grilled Mahi Mahi on risotto with pesto sauce. I ordered Fettuccine Mediteraneo (mixed seafood in a pink creamy sauce). Mine also came with plenty of mussels in the shell. Both dishes came with an amply sized dinner salad. The serving sizes for both dishes were huge (we had plenty to take home). Both dishes were scrumptious that evening and even better the next day as leftovers.  My wife and I each ordered glasses of Lambrusco, which was a perfect complement to our meal.   I can't wait to go back.",

Maybe those peeps had a bad day but I have to say all our dishes were excellent.  I wanted veal and took the advice of our waiter and had the veal with artichokes and shiitake mushrooms with garlic and oil. I can eat a whole cow so when I say the portions are big believe me! Very affordable and the meal comes with spaghetti and a salad or soup. Great value and the wine prices were reasonable as well.  A very friendly place where you feel like family. My suggestion would be to offer a house wine in a carafe.   Other dishes ordered at the table were veal parm and eggplant parm both great dishes.I am use to a thinner cut of veal (pounded) but their veal was cooked perfectly and was very tender.  The pizza looked good as well. Definitely worth a try.",

Though this is very iconic of American Italian cuisine, a dish of pasta served in this manner in Italy would be disaster. In authentic Italian cuisine, the pasta sauce is always incorporated into the pasta before serving.",

The spaghetti I ordered for my son \"tastes like cardboard\" his words...  the pasta I ordered was supposed to have a garlic/olive oil sauce and instead had looked like they accidentally put red sauce on then wiped it off and also had zero flavor. The mozzarella cheese was like rubber.   Our experience with the downtown location was excellent so I was so sad to have wasted so much money trying this location. I highly suggest you try any other location. This was absolutely horrible.",

Their bread is so delicious and fresh, we were lucky to get bread straight from the oven. Their mozzarella sticks are my favorite so far! They have a lot of options to choose from and everything that I ever had there is great. My favorite dish is eggplant parmigiana but this time I went with lasagna. The portion is so big that I shared with my mother in law and I even brought leftovers home. The other 4 people shared the pepperoni pizza that was huge and we also had leftovers. When the cake came all the waitress/waiter came to sing happy birthday. The only thing that they need to improve asap is the time that they take to prepare the meal. The place was busy but not packed enough for them to take so long to get our food ready.",

    "text": "Great meal and great service. Huge portions and a nice little spot in Ayrsley for an Italian dinner.  We started with a plate of mussels in white sauce to start. Heavy on the garlic and butter, but a big plate and fun to eat. Maybe a special fork would have been useful because after about two of them, you just give up and go at it with fingers. At the end, you're left with a plate of butter and garlic that's perfect for the table bread.  The caesar salad was a big miss. A platter of romaine lettuce topped with croutons that did not seem handmade and then shredded mozzarella cheese? With a small pot of sharp caesar dressing on the side. Me, I prefer my salad dressing already tossed into the salad and with actual parmesan cheese. We took a couple bites and then left the rest.  The main course was great. My wife opted for the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was tender and the mushrooms and sauce were flavorful and rich. The marinara sauce on the pasta was a little sweet and heavy with basil.  I chose the Chicken Gorgonzola. The sauce was very rich and very cheesy. Lots of mushrooms in there. Where my wife's chicken was tender, mine was a little rubbery and tough. Not enough to send back, but enough that it took some effort to cut with the steak knife. Since hers was perfect, I'm thinking that mine was just an off one.  For dessert, we got a tiramisu to share. Almost entirely lady fingers and mascarpone custard, there was no rum or coffee soaked into it. Sweet and tasty, but not quite tiramisu.  Overall, a good meal and great service from Tiffany. I'm a fan.",

I can say they are consistent - my favorite dish is Shrimp Fra Diavolo and it is the same as the first time I had it 20 years ago at the other location. Delicious! Great fresh tasting sauce, huge shrimp, just right clams. The crusty bread is just right and I could drink their house salad dressing. Bf got the chicken Marsala and the flavor was also on point. For a delicious, casual Italian meal (or a fantastic real pizza pie), I recommend Portofino's.   P.S. When I say casual I mean decent casual, folks. We saw some rednecks walk in wearing sloppy t-shirts and short-shorts... . Come on ppl, have a little respect for yourselves.   I wish the bar was bigger at Portofino's but I guess the size keeps them from having a 'bar crowd' and the trouble that goes along with it. They certainly have a steady stream of diners, a testament to their food and service.",

We had a great time visiting, but while it sounds like they come here quite frequently I can only give it three stars.  It should have been a clue when the waitstaff was speaking to us in Spanish at an Italian restaurant.  We ordered some appetizers which were ok, but they were primarily fried.  The second sign that I should have been concerned was the massive number of items of the menu.  I believe that a smaller menu where everything is executed well is more important than being able to serve every dish possible from an Italian cookbook or grandmother.For dinner, I ordered a shrimp and pasta dish which was fine but did not stand out at all.  I think that they pride themselves on big portions and lose some focus on the quality of the food.    I appreciate the thought from the team that brought us here, but I may be spoiled from having had lots of really good Italian food.",

After 10 minutes, got sat at a table to get served, unfortunately it was a booth right next to the computer where they ring things in. Had to listen to one guy complaining about this from foreigners and another about it how slow things were. Tabasco sauce was 7 months old and pale.  Anything more would be nitpicking I suppose.

I finally got around to it for a lunch recently and the experience was a little lackluster. The food was fine, but not as amazing. My personal pizza came out when my boyfriend was almost done with his sandwich and wasn't as good as I remember the full size pizzas.

Today for Lunch I came here the the Ayrsley location, honestly I love the other locations a little bit more especially the one one Eastway probably since it was the original location.   But back to the food here at Ayrsley. It's still good now the pizza is always wonderful it's just your standard NY Style nothing too fancy but just tastes wonderful, and I honestly do like the order online feature. The pasta dishes are always so good if you stay at the restaurant, I've ordered the pasta dishes for take out on a few occasions and have been terribly disappointed, I always feel like there is never enough sauce. Tip: So if you order take out request extra gravy. But every time I have ate at the restaurant it is so good.   The wait staff is always on top of their game and really take care for thier guests and I don't think I've ever had a terribly long wait for my meals.   Summary yeah Portofinos has great Italian food overall no matter what location. If you order pasta to go request extra gravy. Pizza is always spot on. Definitely would recommend to friends and not feel like I steered them in a bad direction.",

I mentioned I was there a few minutes early for a 7:00 reservation. They didn't ask my name and one of the hostesses pointed to the back of the restaurant and said \"you can go back there.\". I was a bit confused, but thought perhaps they had another hostess in the back section that I needed to check in with instead. I proceeded to the back, but there were nothing but tables with guests. I walked back to the front and asked what they were instructing me to do, they all started speaking Spanish to each other, and AGAIN, one of the hostesses said to me \"you can just meet your party back there!\". I was thoroughly confused and asked to walk with me to the back to help me understand what she was saying. She walked with me, pointed to a table with 3 guests and said \"you can just go sit with your party, right there\". Um...it wasn't my party and she would have known that had she bothered to ask my name to begin with. I told her that wasn't my party and she walked me back up front to the podium and THEN she asked my name. She also proceeded to speak in Spanish to other hosts, again...and they began laughing. The host then snapped at me to \"come this way!\". No apology for making me walk all over the restaurant and feel like an idiot. Instead, she made me feel bad for inconveniencing her! Good grief!   Service for the meal wasn't much better, unfortunately. We waited 20 mins to order drinks. It took 15 minutes for drinks to arrive, Then, we waiting another 15 minutes to order our food.  It was terrible!   On the plus side, the food was pretty good and it's the only reason for my 3-star rating, instead of the 2 I was initially going to give.   I had Chicken Marsala, my husband had Chicken Parmesan, and our guest had Eggplant Parmesan. I didn't have any of the bread, but my husband said it was good.  If only the service was a good as the food. With so many customer-focused restaurants in the market, there's no need to ever return to this location. Sadly, this is 2 Portofino's in the area that we've had terrible service at.",

    "text": "So, I have my staple dish or dishes that I use as a gauge to how good or authentic an establishment is based on what they are trying to sell. For Italian, that dish is Marsala (either chicken or veal). Anyone that has made or attempted to make Marsala knows this is a labor of love. Either it takes a while to make fresh or requires some serious prep time to pull off. You can tell when shortcuts are taken. First, if its Marsala, it's got to have the taste of Marsala wine.   I ordered the Veal Marsala and this did not disappoint. The veal was tender enough to cut with a fork, lightly breaded, pefect amount of mushrooms (enough that I had enough for the last bite) and complimented with a beautifully done marsala sauce (not excessive where is was drowning in it, but enough to get that marsala flavor).   Please, if you're an Italian restaurant, offer a good selection of Italian wines (bottle or by the glass). Was actually surprised by the selection here by the glass. Had a glass (or two, maybe three ) of a delicious Super Tuscan. Thanks Portofino for providing a wonderful dining experience. Will be back next time I'm in town.   fino alla prossima volta",

Look, I wouldn't downgrade a restaurants rating for the reasons listed above but I will downgrade the review when the food is less than sub-par.  I couldn't even tell you what pizza we ordered at this point because it was so un memorable.  The ingredients were so bland that crushed red pepper couldn't even liven it up!  It was just a disappointing meal to say the least.  We didn't even take our left overs home.  I won't be back to this Portofinos or any other locations any time soon.",

They have 2 designated parking spots just outside their door but just a few steps away is a large, free parking deck which is very convenient on busy nights.    On this day I went with my son and we thought we would grab a quick bite but we left feeling a little underwhelmed. The restaurant was clean as usual and because it was the middle of the day it was relatively empty.  We sat in a booth and were served by Scott.  He has been there a while and is usually very pleasant, this day was no different.    We ordered wings as an appetizer, an order of Chicken Parmigiana and an order of Pomodoro.  The wings were very good, and so was the Chicken Parm.  The Pomodoro was flavorful but they were very stingy with the pasta in the dish.  I felt as if I was paying for a plate of cooked tomatoes so I asked for some additional pasta to mix in.  Although Scott was the server, a different person (a young woman) was clearing dishes from the tables.  Before I realized it she had walked away with the pasta.  I am not sure what was going on but I was very frustrated with this especially after I saw that the bill was $56.  I will go again, but it is unlikely that I will order the Pomodoro again.",

Now that was service. The employees weren't super friendly, but neither was I, so it was a push. I ordered a small cheese pie and a meatball parmigiana. The pizza was very good. New York style. I enjoyed every bit of it. The meatball sub was good. Not great. There was something missing about it. I think I'm searching for childhood memories in every bite, which is huge to live up to.   Anyway, I will definitely go back to try the rest of the huge menu they have to offer.",

We came for an early dinner before the rush and was sat right away. The tables are tight so you can definitely hear the conversation next to our table. Maybe we had a newer server but it felt like she kept on coming up and rushing us (for drink orders, apps, entrees, etc) and interrupting our conversation. But it was ironic because we waited in between our apps and entrees for at least 25 minutes for dinner so by the time I received my pasta, I wasn't as hungry anymore. I love pasta with clams so I decided to try it here and it was ok. Not very flavorful and the clams were tiny; some shells didn't even have clams in them. They have a big menu so maybe we can come back and try something else.",

Italian Wedding Soup was not made the traditional way with chicken stock, it was overpowering due to being made with a beef or veal stock.  The Veal Marsala sauce was flavorful, but the veal cutlets were not.  They don't pound the veal thin here, therefore you wind up getting a 1/2\" slabs of tough meat.  On the upside, the special of the night, Osso Buco was prepared so the veal fell off the bone and was very tender and flavorful.  Espresso & Cappuccino were good, but the accompanying Cannoli was drenched in chocolate syrup, which overpowered the cheese filling.  Chantal, our server, was attentive and friendly.  Enrico was at the register picking his teeth (I think).  Never saw a manager even though I sent back over half of my meal.  Portofino Italian Restaurant at 2127 Ayrsley Town Blvd in Charlotte NC is definitely not on my list of restaurants to revisit.",

Trying to \"sell\" my friends and me food by passing by other people's plate? While interrupting conversations and worst part is, that is someone else's food from another table!!! How is that okay? You're bringing it over to us to \"sell\" or advertise like that is sooooo soooo unbecoming!  Then there was today. I have to admit I always give people a second chance. So, True to myself, I decide to keep an open mind. Well well well.... what do you know? Same waiter! Ooooh dearie me!!!!  He comes over, takes our order. Then comes back much much later with a plate that looks like something my friend had ordered and we saw him take it to the table right next to us!!!!!!!   I was disgusted... utterly ashamed and wished I had not suggested this place to my friend - ugh! He comes back, plate in hand, looks at us both and says \"just some short selling there!\"  In any case, like I said, good food, disgusting manners, won't be going back!",

If you've never been in this area, you should realize that it's located in a popular and heavily-trafficked shopping village--it may be hard for you to find a parking spot. Anyways, I was part of a party of 2, and was seated quickly on a Friday during the lunch rush. My friend whom I went with was someone straight-outta-Italy. She ordered the gnocchi and I ordered the Bolognese (spaghetti with meat sauce). Our waiter was very friendly and attentive-- he made me realize how much I drank, because in the short hour we were there, he refilled my soda 3-4 times! My bolognese was soooooooo darn good. It was MEMORABLE good. It was so good that I would go out of my lazy way just to come here to eat it again. It made me realize how a simple dish of pasta with ground beef and tomato sauce can hit that special spot. Now I can't stop thinking about it. I actually ordered the same dish from the Portofino's in Park Road, but it wasn't the same. Maybe it was because I got it to-go, I'm not sure. But, I will always remember that spaghetti dish in this location as one of the best spaghetti meals I've ever had. (P.S. my Italian friend also said her dish was very good-- it wasn't just me)",

The service is fantastic and the food is authentic Italian (again, that's coming from the mouth of a New Yorker!). The Chicken Parm is my go-to dish -- my ultimate comfort food. Overall, I'd highly recommend this spot if you're in need of good food. Period.",

The server split our tab which is a huge deal when you're out with a large group like ours. Finally, the food was tasty and the portions were generous. I liked the bruschetta very much.",

Served with a crusty Italian bread that was warm and very good.  Other food ordered was lasagna, and noodles were kind of soft almost over cooked.  Pizza which was a flat New York style and very good as well.  Salads were a good variety of vegetables.  Beware regular Italian dressing was mostly vinegar!  Prices were good.  Definitely recommend!",

I have a real soft spot for Italian, so I am always endeavoring to find a really decent spot that will supply my stomach with Italian goodness.  Started off a little rocky since I am unfamiliar with this shopping center.  I think I was in awe of the mixed residential and businesses below apartment setup they have here and I totally drove by the parking lot.... we ended up parking \"in the back lot\" in between the Fintastic and Portofinos and the spaces were a little tight.    We were greeted warmly and it was early Sunday afternoon... so we got seated right away.  Our server was pretty friendly... we felt a little rushed, even though we were one of the only tables being served at that time.  Still, our server got our orders correct and kept our waters/teas filled.  I ordered Portobello mushroom ravioli with Alfredo sauce... yes... I know, not the healthiest choices, but it was just what my stomach and tastebuds wanted that afternoon.  Next time I come here, I will definitely order pizza.  It looked very good from the distance.",

Everything else is usually good here from the sandwiches to the regular lasana to the Chicken gorgonzola which is one of my favorites.    They also make their own house salad dressing which is a tomato-based creamy italian.  It's great on salads and also it's good for dipping your bread into.   The pizza is very good here as well, probably one of my favorite pizza places in Charlotte because they still make it in a regular pizza oven and not one of those conveyer belts.",

Everyone greeted us and everyone was extremely friendly! Our waiter Ash was great, he was quick to take our order and always there if we needed anything. We started with the bruschetta for an appetizer, very good. Then my husband ordered the veal parmigiana while I ordered the Montese pizza. Both were wonderful and great portions! There was a decent amount of prosciutto on the pizza, which was great because a lot of places tend to skimp on this topping. I typically make my own at home to get what I want since it's my favorite, but now I have a place to go to get exactly what I want. We definitely found a place that will be one of our new favorites!",

No crust on the outside and very very bland.  The marinara sauce was similarly bland.  No spice to it at all.   So the spaghetti and meatballs really a disappointment.  The chicken portion of the dish was very nice but it was once again paired with the bland marinara.  Service was fine but the ambiance suffered due to a very large (25 person) party that was just loud and there was other seating that they could have put us at.  I just feel that there has to be a better Italian restaurant experience out there.",

Finally as I sat there tapping my fingers on the table and looking less then amused the hostess took notice and mentioned to our server and pointed to our table - Now he may have noticed on his own if he wasn't standing at the bar watching the soccer game on TV.

The caprese salad was amazing, fresh tomatoes, mozzarella and sweet basil with a touch of olive oil - freshness in every bite. Pizza margerita a little on the chewy side, had some difficulty finishing it off.",

    "text": "Pretty darn mediocre to be honest. I ordered the lobster ravioli and it came to me garnished with grated cheese like the stuff from a plastic container that you put on pizza. I'm sorry, but if you are serving me a $25 pasta plate, put fresh parm on it or nothing at all. The ravioli was crunchy almost like the lobster had sand in it. The sangria tasted like juice. The service was nice though. Other than that, will not be returning here.",

    "text": "Easily the worst Italian food I've ever had. We ordered the mozzarella caprese for an appetizer and it wasn't good. It lacked a lot of flavor and had way too much oil. Everything was just soggy. I ordered the alla panna, which is supposed to be pasta with a really good cheesy cream sauce. It had zero flavor and it was really watery. The sauce was dripping off of the pasta like a water faucet. My wife ordered one of the pastas and it was watery, as well. I'm slightly upset that I paid 13.95 per meal because I know I could've made a better meal at home. We will definitely not be returning or recommending Portofino's to anyone.",

    "text": "I was brought to another one of Portofino's locations by a New York Italian, so I knew this had to be good.  Lucky for me, there is this location right in my own neighborhood!  I pass by it every day, and it wasn't until last night that I finally decided to try it.  If you've ever been in Ayrsley Town, it seems to be pretty dead for the most part.  So, I was pretty surprised to come on a Friday night and there actually be a wait to be seated!  The place was full!  Luckily, it was only a 5-10 minute wait and the bartended was friendly and asked us if we wanted to order drinks.  FYI, the sangria is yum.  Yes, yum.  Once we were seated, a friendly and upbeat waitress with a Hello Kitty-esque bow in her hair came to take our orders.  I knew it was going to be too much food, but my husband and I each ordered an entree anyway, to be able to get a sense of how the food was.  Together, we ordered the baked lasagna, chicken tortellini, french onion soup, caesar salad and a cannoli to top it all off.  Needless to say, it was all delish and the portions were True to Italian family style.  I woke up early this morning just so I could eat some of the leftovers before my husband wakes up ;)  My only note of constructive feedback is to say the baked lasagna wasn't piping hot when we got it, leading us to believe it isn't made to order, but nothing a little microwaving can't fix for the next day!",

    "text": "Call me a Northeast snob but this place is just terrible. Had the lasagna. I've had bad lasagna before and great lasagna but this was just an embarrassment to lasagna in general. This was so bad it can't even be classified as lasagna. Let me tell you, if I can't even distinguish where the pasta ends from where the puddle of sauce and melted cheese begins, then this isn't a piece of lasagna. It's a damn bowl of red sauce soup. A slop of loose meat with no flavor drowning in a wardrobe of soggy pasta and anchored by far too much cheese. A recommendation for this dish (and the calzone and other pasta dishes on the menu) LESS IS MORE. I'm serious. Now I'm not expecting some artisan revival paying homage to the cultural nuances of northern Italian cuisine but FFS, cut back on the sauce, cut back on the cheese and just understand that nothing about this dish was remotely appealing. I'm sorry I had to be the one to tell you this. I'm sorry for maybe not knowing the clientele. I'm sorry for making you throw out so much. But in all honesty, you should be apologizing to the customers for bringing them such a meal. Nice location, ambience was Ok. Staff was quick, friendly and experienced. Less is more, trust me.",

    "text": "The wife and I dropped in for lunch the other day and things were so good I decided to write an update.  Veal Shitake was some of the best Italian food I have had in a while and the veal parmigiana was top notch as well but the reason I felt compelled to write an update was the dessert.    Normally we are not tempted by desserts out but after the waiter ran through the usual suspects, tiramisu, cheese cake, cannoli, he mentioned Italian rum cake and my wife and I both perked up.  We decided to split a piece.  Let me say now that if I didn't love her greatly I might have slipped her a mickey and ate the whole thing myself.  This was the lightest, most flavorful, moistest, most balanced cake ever in the history of cake.  Mildly sweet with a hint of rum, light whipped cream and a light chocolate and vanilla pastry cream filling between layers.    Do yourself a favor, go to Portofino's just for an espresso and a slice of this heavenly confection.",
