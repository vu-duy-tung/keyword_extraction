We walked right across the hall to Saloon and were welcomed right in, hats and all. Sorry Willie, we won't be back! I'm sure the frozen concoctions are good, but it's the principal.",

We go early, grab a seat on the patio and enjoy the frosty adult beverages and yummy food until our butts go numb from the not-so-comfortable chairs.  I have stuck mostly to the margarita and the pina colado with strawberry daquiri (yeah, so I'm classic!), but most recently I sampled their WEAK WILLIE (due to my prego state) and it was delicious!  Refreshing and YUMMY and made me feel special because I was drinking something similiar to everyone else.  (SO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE PREGNANT).  I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was very good.  Only negative was it says it comes with fresh salsa......no it doesn't.  It comes with chopped tomatoes and chopped iceberg lettuce.  Maybe they have salsa and mine was just forgotten, but someone else at the table ordered them too and they didn't get it either.  Just be forewarned to ask for it, if that's something you like.  Bryan ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and it was also very good.  Service was good, too, for as busy as it was.  We will continue to be cheap vagrants and utilize this great patio for it's great listening perks and it's yummy treats!",

For $9 you can get a large, strong, slushie-like alcoholic drink (and a cool cup you can keep and use later). It's a great place to pre-game and then head out to your destination for the night. When they first opened they charged guys $5 after a certain time, but I don't think they do that anymore. I've never ate there, I think Wet Willie's focus is on their drinks so I stick to that. I didn't find the place too loud like some of the other posters its a typical bar. My friends and I were able to talk and even hit the dance floor for a couple of songs. The waiters are friendly and the drinks are strong. I recommend this place!",

Atmosphere- The place looks really cool but it doesn't exactly scream Wet Willies...I mean I pictured giant plastic ears or even perhaps Willy Nelson plunging into some water, but this place looked a bit more like a jazz club. It's definitely very nice inside, just not what I expected. For a Saturday night at 9pm it was fairly empty . We were stopped at the door to show ID's (kind of odd since it was empty ..you would think the bartender could handle it). We had a group that attempted to meet us afterwards and was not let in because one  gentleman was wearing summer clothing (a sleeveless shirt but it was tasteful...) , come on' it's a frozen drink bar, chill out (hehe) !   The only other problem with the atmosphere was that they had a band/or musician warming up...but this took a ridiculous amount of time and we were treated with incessant screeching throughout our stay.  Drinks- There were several to choose from and I tried 3 or 4 flavors (as you're encouraged to sample) but all were entirely too sweet or just plain icky, so I felt bad but I decided to wait until the next place we visited to order a drink. I will say only 2 out of the 5 ladies in our group decided to get drinks. They just weren't very good in all honesty.   Service- The two bouncers were very friendly but our bartender didn't so much as crack a smile.    Overall I don't think I'll be returning to WW. They take themselves very seriously...perhaps a bit too seriously. A frozen drink place should be fun, this really wasn't.",

I came here with a group of girls for my friend's bachelorette party. It was about 8 of us. And they simply do not have a big enough table for a group of our size. The service was not the most desirable, but that's not without trying (I can at least recognize the effort). Food arrived at different time, at which point they had no idea which one belongs to whom (isn't there seat # for that purpose?) And the bride-to-be was the next to last one to get her food (I arrived late and I still got my food before she did).  The slushee was $11 for the large size, which is quite hefty of a price.  The only \"positive\" I like to mention is that their chicken fingers were surprisingly not bad, and it actually seemed like it was frozen or from a box.",

BUT this isn't Miami, it's Charlotte, so you take it how it is.   Went here on a Friday night and was very disappointed because they had a live band playing all night, which was so-so. But the crowd was and older crowd(30+) who didn't seem to know how to have a good time.   Since that time, I've been back 3 times, all on Saturdays. The music is great, the drinks are the same(we always have a few shots & mixed drinks along with our slushies), and the food is tasty. I have tried the spinach dip(not so good) and the bbq wings, which I adore! The sauce is soooooo good, I get their wings every time I go. I even dream about them during the week haha.  My best bet, is to go on a Saturday night, get really drunk, and dance like noones watching and I guarantee you'll have a blast!",

Definitely don't like being unexpectedly hot and sweaty when I go out.    Our server was very friendly and asked us right out the gate if we wanted to sample any drinks before we ordered.  Of course my friends and I said \"Yes!\"  I tried the \"Margarita, Sex on the Beach, Bahama Mama and Mango.\"  After my mini taste test I decided to go with the Mango.  Crazy thing is that I don't even like mangoes but my Wet Willie's Mango treat in a cup was shear ambrosia.    Aside from the great service and delicious drink the live band that was playing that  Friday evening was amazing.  As with most bars and clubs the crowd is different every night but if you give me a good drink and great music who cares about the crowd.  A good time is what you make it.

Weekdays are not busy, so I wouldn't plan a trip during the week unless you wanted to sample the Karaoke on Wednesday night.  Although I will say the last show we came out of on Wed. still had no one inside to even sing. Anyway, last night we got to our show a little early so we decided to pop in here first for some daiquiris.   I wanted the biggest bang for my buck so I got the high octane Call a Cab, and my wife got the Pina Colada. Hers was tasty and delicious, mine was not, but I bought it for the kick not the taste. My wife said it was like a Luden's cough drop with some grain alcohol, I didn't argue. After the show we stopped back in and there was a little more of a crowd. The bartender Ace was probably one of the nicest people I have ever met in the service industry, just felt I had to give him a shout out he was that pleasant to talk to. I had him mix chocolate and strawberry flavors and that concoction was a nice follow up drink to the show before we left in search of grub.  I read some bad reviews for this place concerning the food, but use common sense people with Mattie's diner and VBGB right around the corner you don't come to Wet Willie's for the food you come for the brain freeze.   A good spot to start a date or drop by in the middle of one, but no reason to spend more then 30 minutes here. Drinks are sweet and tasty so there is that motivation to bring a woman here, but the crowd and atmosphere probably won't keep you here for long.",

    "text": "Oh my goodness, this place is so bad it's almost funny.  1. The alcoholic slushies somehow manage to have a rancid ether-like smell and to have seemingly no alcohol in them at the same time. They also taste strongly of food coloring. I could barely finish mine, which was highly recommended by the waitress.  2. A friend of mine took one bite of his \"cheesesteak\" and didn't touch it again. I can only assume it was inedible. I hedged my bets and got chips and a trio of dips: salsa, spinach and artichoke, and \"homemade\" cheese sauce. I thought, how bad can this be? To hedge further, I asked the waitress if the cheese was actually made in house. \"Um I don't know, I don't work in the kitchen.\" I would have prompted her to go find out, but I figured again (unwisely), how bad can it be?   Here's a breakdown of how bad it was: the chips were stale. The salsa had a strangely off taste and smell...almost as though it was borderline bad. I took a few bites just to be sure, and my date did too. Yup. Something is wrong. The spinach and artichoke dip had a distinct freezer note. And the cheese sauce.  Ohh the \"homemade\" (it said so on the menu!!) cheese sauce.  I would bet my firstborn that pool of fetid yellow rubber was not conjured in house. If it was, holy crap, these people need to fire their cooks.  3. We were in the quiet part of the bar, relatively speaking, and it was still fairly noisy. After sometime around 9:30-10, someone turned up the music so loud we were shouting over it. We settled our bill and got the heckfire out of there.  Not many places raise my ire to scathing one-star levels, but Wet Willies did in a big way (this is probably abundantly clear). The real tragedy is that it seems like people consider this a fun place to hang out with decent daiquiris. I can only thank God I'm not in the drink-my-face-numb phase of my life anymore, if this is how the young'uns get it done in Charlotte.",

I can make better adult slushies at home, for less money. Although, I will say some of the flavors are pretty good, but nothing to lose your panties over.  My best friend and I also had the chicken quesadilla's, which tasted pretty good! What the hey, give it a try! Nothing to lose...",

Wet Willie's, for those who don't know, serves up a multitude of frozen daiquiris. Some of the combination's, quite frankly, taste like a chemical spill gone bad, while others are pretty tasty! They come in three different sizes and are \"spot on good\" on a hot southern day!  The food at Wet Willie's is typical bar type food...Not the best, but not the worst either.  This location is conveniently located in the NC Music Factory complex (Time Warner Uptown Amphitheater) Directly adjacent to the Comedy Club. It's a big spacious place, nice and clean, and the staff are very friendly!",

After spending a few hours at Fridays at the Factories we headed in to Wet Willies. We waited in a random line even though it was pretty empty inside. The hold up? They were using electronic handheld scanners to check ID's. I've never seen this in Charlotte, but I assume its no big deal. I thought wrong.  The girls infront of us ID's would not scan, but they got pushed right thru. My friends ID scanned fine. My ID would not scan for some unknown reason. They tried 5+ times, but could not get it to register. So I'm just standing there.. waiting.. Finally after inspecting my ID like it was some kind of fake they show me this piece of paper. This paper has peoples names, addresses, etc. All sorts of contact information just laying out on the counter. They explain I have to write in my information to get in.  Yeah right. You just let two females in, but want me to fill out some paper work? The bouncers had no ideas the females where with us so I pulled them and my friend back out. I explained I was leaving. They just gave me a 'so what' look.   I walked next door and walked right in to Black Bear Saloon where the experience was great. After that I headed to Halo to finish the night .  I will never go back to Wet Willie's and ensure everyone I know will avoid it.",

Coming from a restaurant manager myself I have seen all types of stuff and all types of things but this I have never. We came in it was 7 ladies. Tim (who says he is a manager) was the ONLY one working it was around 3:30. One of the girls with me asked how are the salads he responded \"I mean there salads\", we let it go.. When he came back she said are y'all tacos good, he responded \"I mean there tacos, you can't miss up tacos\" at this point we are getting his bad attitude so I said wow your very sarcastic and he said \"thank you\" and I told hem it wasn't a compliment. Another person with us ordered a burger but she did not know what came on or it was some type of confusion. So when it came out she said I wanted everything on it he responded in a VERY hostile and high voice \"YOU TOLD ME YOU WANT THIS\" and kept going back and forth with her.yelling. This is to make a long story short. The moral of the story as a manager or a employee the customer is ALWAYS RIGHT! NO MATTER WHAT!!! You don't know how many times I been cursed out and couldn't act that way back. But we were not even rude to hem at all in the first place. I have never seen a employee or manger or treat anyone like this in my years of customer service!! When we were leaving we told hem how rude it was and that he should treat people better because that was unnecessary and he said \"thank you\" never once apologized or anything. When a customer is upset no matter if they are right or wrong you as a manager is suppose to apologize.  I will NEVER EVER IN MY LIFE return to this place! I am so disgusted by the service we received. There was a few people to witness this and they were even looking like they couldn't believe it. As I said no workers were there and then after it happen two other employees walked in and he was trying to act nice. As they all say at the bar and ate their lunch. And I never known employees could eat in front of guest: but that's the least of my concern out this whole thing .",

The servers were all very nice and immediately greeted me when I arrived at the bar, which I love... (It annoys me to see people standing behind the bar, going through great pains not to acknowledge a patron...) These guys were incredibly friendly...   There was a DJ, too... He played some pop music and it seemed to go over okay with the crowd... It was a decent time, but I'm not really into the clubby bar scene, so I won't be back for that...

    "text": "Wet Willie's is a chain of frozen daiquiri bars that is found around the south.  My first experience with them was in Myrtle Beach but Charlotte's had their own for a few years.    The place is pretty simple.  The bar is to your right as you walk in.  There area few tables in and booths available as well.  And they also have live bands some nights as well.  There's also a nice sized patio overlooking the music factory plaza and stage.    The frozen drinks have interesting flavors like Peach, Mango, Chocolate Thunder, White Russian, Sex on the Beach, Call a Cab, Sour Apple, Strawberry, and a few more.  You can mix flavors to your own satisfaction in one of 3 size cups.  A small comes in a regular sized plastic cup and costs you $8 which I think is a little steep.  From there each size is a $1 more than the previous one.  $10 for a drink is a little much for me to do as a regular thing but it's a nice change once in a while.  The staff was knowledgeable and they let you sample each flavor so you can pick the best one to settle with.  Just sip slowly otherwise you'll end up with brain freeze.",

I had the chicken tender and french fries and both more than met my needs.  Drinking I had one of their slushies/slurpees or whatever they are filled with alcohol.  I had the Superman which I was told was one of the strongest drinks on the menu and they were not cheap with the alcohol.  They were also having 2 dollar jello shots and in my past experience you can't really taste alcohol in jello shots well these were some strong shots because I could definitely taste the alcohol.  I definitely left full and with a buzz after my visit.  Come out to Wet Willie's if you want a cool place to hang with friends, have some drinks and a good time.",

The Wet Willies in Charlotte is actually the biggest Wet Willies in existence (fact for you!) and will occasionally have live music on the weekends but would love to see more acts throughout the week.   The slushies are of course quite tasty and I highly advise mixing the flavors - to get them straight up is strong and the Call-A-Cab on it's own is like medicine. Mix it with Shock Treatment and Attitude Improvement to create a 'Superwoman' and you got yourself one tasty libation.   When the bar first opened the drinks were pretty cheap. I figured they would increase and of course they did so now a large runs you $10 - remember most of the flavors are made with grain alcohol, which can knock you on your ars (yeah... I said ars...) but still $10 for a drink? Yeah... not my favorite part of this bar. And be advise, place has no wine and 6 domestic bottles you can choose from... but hey, the place is known for the slushies - get a slushy!  And if you're hungry, the food is GOOD! Not like bar food at all but props to Wet Willies for having amazing sauces, such as the tequila glazed wings, and flavorful spices, like the kind that comes in the quesadilla, that really sets the food apart from other bars. And they don't skimp on portions either - you'll get satisfied or full, depending on your order and I highly advise stopping in for lunch or dinner to start your evening.   Great patio as well that faces the Uptown Amphitheater, which means if there is a show you can chill on the patio and hear the band perfectly... you don't see them but you still get to enjoy the tunes!",

They primarily serve ready-mixed daiquiris, but you can also create your own by mixing flavors.   When you walk in, you will see about 30 machines behind the bar with names like \"Call a Cab\", \"Mind Eraser\", and the usual suspects like \"Sex on the Beach\" and margaritas.  I had a \"Call a Cab\" which is made with 190 grain alcohol so obviously it is super strong.  The alcohol actually burned my throat a little bit.  As the name says, you don't want to drink this if you're driving afterwards.  The layout of this Wet Willie's is actually nicer than the ones in Savannah and Chucktown.  There is a small stage where dj's and bands can set up, complete with a dancefloor, plus a patio in front and one in the back overlooking the amphitheater,  There is also a nice little room in the back with couches, seats, and tvs where you can relax.    So, if you happen to be at the NC Music Factory for anything, dip into Wet Willie's for a frozen concoction.",

Once in, we went up to the counter to order some drinks. Having never been there before, my friend asked what drink tasted like chocolate, and the bartender snarked at her that \"Chocolate tasted like chocolate.\" When we tried to order the Call-a-Cab, he asked if we liked Robatussen. While I do appreciate being warned about the flavor of the drink, his attitude was pretty annoying. I've also been to the Myrtle Beach location, where the bartender was very sweet, offered to get us samples, and kept checking back in on us since we were seated at the bar.   As everyone else has warned, don't order Call-a-Cab by itself - it's hard to drink. But everything I have tried (Shock Treatment, Chocolate Thunder, Sour Apple) was delicious.",

A fat Tuesday's just opened up in our area and surprisingly it was really good . I know that wet willies and Fat Tuesday are basically the same so I figured hey why not go have some good daiquiris and enjoy charlotte . We got there around 6 pm it was fairly empty which was great for me and my boyfriend . We sat at the bar and immediately I asked for some samples . Most of them tasted like poison to me but then again I can't stand the taste of alcohol. I got my mix and my boyfriend got his . We paid for the kozie cup which was 21 bucks and NOT WORTH IT . my drink mix was pina colada , mango and margarita (weird I know ) at first it was okay I could tolerate it but after a while the after taste was like cough medicine . Like drinking NyQuil . My boyfriend had the attitude improvement , call a cab and sex on the beach mix . His was not bad not bad at all but they all had that bad after taste . I'm not sure if it was the mix they used , the time we came or what but it was so nasty I had to force myself to finish the drink . I ended up ordering an appetizer (which they microwaved btw ) the spinach dip to remove the taste from my mouth . It helped but it wasn't the best . The girl serving our drinks was okay we even tipped her but she wasn't really open to explaining the drinks or even offering good mixes she just said here you want this ok bye . Overall I would NOT go back , it was a bad experience and the drinks were disgusting . I'd rather stick to the fat Tuesday's out here .",

    "text": "08/11/13  Sisters, BIL, and I arrived an hour before the concert next door at Uptown Amphitheatre, so we stopped at Wet Willie's for drinks and a bite to eat.  After IDs were checked, we sat ourselves.  (No one greeted us save security, and everyone else were seating themselves...)  The colorful murals that adorned the bar wall with all the daiquiri flavor machines made up for the initial disappointment caused by the wafts of stale beer that greeted me at the door.  With so many machines already churning out varieties of daiquiris, I knew that I wouldn't be able to try them due to corn allergy (corn syrup), so I asked our server MJ if they had mojitos (no- discontinued daiquiri flavor; I was looking for the actual drink, anyway), or wine (no).  Just bottled beer (standard domestics- Coors, Michelob, Bud, and YuengLing lager).  \"Mixed drinks\" consisted of vodka or Jack Daniels.  Sisters ordered Bahama Mama and Pina Colada, BIL had a Yuengling, and I ended up with a Michelob Ultra- not bad, a little too bland, but no bitterness or aftertaste, and it went well with the pepperjack cheeseburger, with bacon I ordered. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wet-willies-charlotte?select=cvHa6c7-QyV7IMghtJ7fZA#cvHa6c7-QyV7IMghtJ7fZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wet-...</a>  The bun top had a dusting of cornmeal, so I set it aside, but the rest of the burger was delicious!  Cooked medium, had a nice kick from the pepperjack cheese (older sis found it too spicy), and had nice flavors and textures (good bread!)  Bacon was a bit too greasy, but I didn't pat them down with a napkin to absorb some of the oil like I normally do, so it was partly my fault.  Baby sis claimed them eventually, after everyone else devoured the chips and salsa app they had ordered.  BIL had asked for a Philly cheesesteak (made with grilled onions and mushrooms and topped with a homemade cheese sauce), but MJ must've forgotten it when I asked him about the beverage selections.  No worries, since the rush order didn't take long (two to three minutes?), was hot (not cold at all, considering it arrived so soon after the discrepancy was mentioned, and it was complimentary (due to the order being forgotten).  The fries here were TERRIFIC!  We all raved about them, and for a non-gourmet restaurant, the fries here were some of the best I've ever bitten into (delicious flavor and perfectly-crisped)!    The plastic daiquiri beverage glasses had Wet Willie cartoon-comic graphics on them, so I asked MJ if we could take them home with us, and he said yes.  My sisters didn't want to keep them, so I now have souvenirs for this Charlotte trip!  :)  Could've been 3.5 stars if the beverage selections were larger, and please work on eradicating the stale beer smell!  Women's restroom was clean and stylish though, considering WW could be considered a dive bar...  Perhaps the restroom is part of The Comedy Zone, which WW shares the floor with?    p.s.  There is an overlook/patio where people can dine and listen in to the concerts next door.  You won't be able to see the stage, but you'll get to people-watch!  (I wonder how we all looked awashed with the lights from the stage?)  People smoke around the concession stands and restrooms below, though, just so you know...",

I ended up getting the wonder woman which is a trio of the strongest drinkas they serve. IT was good but it definitely sneaks up on you. I got the souvenir cup and somehow was able to keep a hold of it through out the night.   After htiting a few other places we decided to come back and get another drink. My friend and I were hungry so we decided to get food and shared fries, wings, and a shrimp quesadilla. The food was surprisingly good! I would definitely come back for a chill night. I don't understand all the negative reviews for this place, the drinks and food are good, the staff is friendly... it's a win in my book.",

I've been to a place like this before and it was a cool experience, so it was fun to find one in Charlotte. I tried the Sex on the Beach and my Boyfriend had the Sour apple. Both were good. On a hot summer night there's not much better than a frozen alcoholic drink. This review is making me sound cheap which I'm not, but I also thought they were pretty expensive for their sizes. You might as well get a large if you're going to get any of them.   Probably the coolest thing about this place is their patio out back. It overlooks the outdoor music area and there happened to be a concert going on. You can't see the stage but you can hear the music and have a cold drink!",

After waiting about 30 minutes I had to flag down a waiter, placed order and it came out in reasonable time. One bright spot was the wings they are simply AMAZING.

When we asked to try a different flavor he said the max was three and we couldn't have anymore?! WTF. We didn't even pick them they were just given to us, so my mom stuck with a full sized Wonder Woman (one of our samples) and I had no idea what to pick and said I needed time and the old man proceeded to stand there until I chose my drink (strawberry lemonade and pina colada which I didn't even want I just wanted him out of my face) all of which was super uncomfortable.
