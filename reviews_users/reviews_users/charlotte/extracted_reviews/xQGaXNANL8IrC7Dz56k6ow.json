    "text": "My experience here was fantastic! Even though they were in the middle of moving to a new location they continued to communicate with me via email in regards to my ordering my daughters cake. I visited them at their new location on their opening day and was very impressed when I walked in. It was very spacious and clean. As I walked  in I was greeted by a few people. As I looked around at their cake displays and treats I got a really good feeling about the cake I had ordered. It definitely looks as though they have great talent for decorating. They have so many cookies, pastries, cupcakes, pies and cakes to choose from that I couldn't wrap my head around what to purchase to take home with me. I had only gone in to speak with Dominica about the final details of the cake I had ordered but found myself needing to purchase some yummy treats. I ended up getting cannolis, napoleons and eclairs. OH MY GOODNESS, OH MY GOODNESS! That's all I can say about those.  Some of the most delicious pastries I have ever tasted. And they are HUGE! I've eaten at some top bakeries/cafes in Los Angeles and this bakery is right up there with those.   I am very excited to take my husband there to eat some items off of their cafe menu. I pick up my daughter's cake in a few days and I can't wait! I  3-10-13  I am updating my review because I just had my daughter's birthday party yesterday and the cake review is in! Upon picking the cake up I was very pleased with the appearance of the cake. They did a stellar job decorating. Once it was time to cut the cake and nosh I was a bit disappointed. Although the cake itself was moist and delicious, the raspberry filling was not something to be desired. All it really is is raspberry jelly donut filling...blech! I decided to look past that but then I cut the mini cake that sat on top of the main cake and was upset to find out that it was not lemon as I had requested it to be. I asked for their signature almond buttercream on the main cake and mini cake that sat on top but it was vanilla buttercream. Them when my daughter dug into her smash cake i noticed it wasn't as white as the vanilla cake so I tasted it and it was lemon with almond buttercream. I asked for her cake to be vanilla with whipped icing. They messed up the order a bit even though I had emailed Dominica several times and went into the bakery to speak with her directly. I even took the time to write down everything as I wanted it to be so there would be no room for error. I watched her write it down on the order form and it still got messed up. Oh well.  This bakery is pretty pricey even for my standards and that is why I got upset about the mixup and raspberry filling.  Although I am impressed with their decorating skills and pastries I do believe that some of their ingredients could be of a higher quality. I still give them four stars overall.",

    "text": "The last time I visited Nona's was when they were at their North Tryon location and I would always stop in and have a cupcake from their cupcake bar. Well I decided to stop in yesterday  with my girlfriend for some desserts and try something new. My girlfriend ordered a red velvet cupcake with chocolate frosting and a Brownie cheesecake. I ordered an almond cupcake with caramel frosting and a Pumpkin cheesecake. The cupcakes were tasty but the cheesecake desserts were actually a layer of pumpkin pie/brownie, a layer of cream cheese frosting, a layer brownie/pumpkin pie and then another layer of the cream cheese frosting on top. There actually wasn't any \"cheesecake\" in there. That was a little disappointing because the cream cheese frosting was extremely sweet and I ended up just scraping it off. So I ended up just eating the pumpkin pie. We paid $5.50 a piece for the \"cheesecake\" desserts. That's $11.00 for pumpkin pie and a brownie. I could've made pumpkin pie and brownies for less than that at home. If you advertise pumpkin cheesecake and brownie cheesecakes, i expect to actually have a cheesecake and not just cream cheese frosting.",

I absolutely LOVE the cupcakes. They are moist, fresh, and flavorful.  I really like their signature Almond icing. I've also ordered a red velvet birthday cake from here. It was the highlight of the birthday party. It was delicious, beautiful and reasonably priced.    I have to intentionally restrict myself from coming here weekly (I'd be as big as a house if I indulged every craving for this place :-) Lucky for me, the new location is not as convenient. Otherwise, I'd be in here a lot more. They have free wi-fi and a few lunch items that I plan to try soon (tomato and asiago soup), but I'm so addicted to the pastries I haven't tried anything else.  If you have a sweet tooth, this place should definitely be in your rotation.",

Some of nearby grocery stores with a decent bakery sections have much better deserts and sweet goodies. Nona's sweets are not fresh, at times, things are drier than gas-station snacks. On top of that, they do not even have any special variety that would make them stand out as a specialty bakery. In addition, it is over-priced.

I originally emailed Nona's and then followed up with a call in order to ensure the correctness of my order (I don't live in Charlotte so I couldn't go to the bakery personally).  My friend picked up the cake for me on the agreed upon ready date, and sent me a picture of it.  I was immediately unhappy with it and told her to go back inside and talk to someone about fixing it.  The cake was supposed to be very similar to a picture that I sent them, which it was, but they skimped on the design.  When I had placed the order I discussed the design in detail with the employee, and she was also looking at the picture I sent, so she was clear on what I wanted.  My friend went back inside Nona's and was able to get the design fixed to my standard.  I thought the cake was fine until we cut it at my mom's birthday dinner.  I specifically ordered a carrot cake with NO nuts...and guess what....the cake had nuts in it!  Overall, the flavor (minus the nuts that we had to pick through/dig out) and final presentation of the cake were excellent, but it should not have had nuts in it, and it should have been decorated correctly from the start.  I contacted Nona's and they were very responsive and offered a refund of about 40% off the cake.  I'm writing this review to let you all know that when ordering a cake from Nona's, be VERY specific about what you want and it would probably help to call in the days leading up to your pickup date to ensure they got your order right.",

    "text": "They offer nice fresh bakery items including an assortment of cookies that remind me of some of my favorite childhood bakery treats.  In particular,  as a kid I loved the little buttery sandwich cookie shaped like a leaf that comes in pink ( sort of cherry flavored) and green (not sure of the flavor of that one) with some chocolate... yum- I haven't had cookies like those in years! Nona's does them well.  Some of their selections are less sweet... definitely a more European type sweet -like their spumoni cookies.    If you like European bakery treats, you should definitely check this place out!",

We spent 30 min. narrowing things down n we decided on a sheet cake. It was perfect for what we wanted. Paid in full to have it by  September 22nd. I was not informed of the cancellation and refund policy. Had I known that I wouldn't attempt to cancel.  I call at 9:10 Monday morning to cancel due to my aunt already purchased a cake for my mothers birthday. The owner says she can only give me store credit. I don't need two cakes. There needs to be a cancellation window in case of emergencies!    The cake shouldn't be in the process of being made.",

As soon as I entered, I was helped by a nice staff member.  He didn't hound me and let me take my time as I decided what I wanted from this wonderful display of sugary yumminess.  The staff was so patient and helpful and even went in the back to get me some samples to try. I bought some cupcakes that LITERALLY melted in my mouth - the softness and moistness of the cupcake was DIVINE!!! I recommend the cupcakes to everyone and the fun part is that they have a cupcake bar where you choose your cake and your frosting based on the flavors of the day ( EVERYTHING is baked fresh daily and you can tell). A hit with my tummy! Must try :)",

Don't get me wrong, there were many goodies on display, available for sale (see photos) and the cafe was open and available for lunch.  I looked around and grabbed a couple goodies for the family.  Service was great and a smile makes all well.  Prices on some items were acceptable (in my humble opinion) while others I thought were too much to pay for that particular item.

Both were good though the Scramble bowl is very reminiscent of Waffle House (if Waffle House got really creative one day). The Scramble Bowl had eggs, bacon and cheese mixed into a cup. It was tasty, but obviously was a pretty heavy meal. The Red Velvet Waffle comes with a meat of your choice and the Waffle itself was perfect. The Red Velvet flavor really comes through with some confectioners sugar sprinkled on top. Both items were reasonably priced (under $7). The ambiance was interesting. It was a little noisy but it is clear these were all people that worked or lived in the area. This included a group of older ladies in the back playing cards (too funny). The noise level wasn't bad and the seating arrangement really helped with that. However I would say that the seating is a little odd, some tables even had mismatched chairs. The arrangement isn't  bad but it is unusual for a cafe. The music that plays in the background is classic, and at a perfect decibel where you can hear it but don't have to talk over it. Overall I recommend this cafe for people looking for some unusual breakfast options at a very affordable price. Oh and they do not really know how to steep tea, but I didn't hold that against them since very few places steep tea correctly.",

The current location is very convenient, always clean inside and has plenty of parking.  You can dine in or enjoy a beautiful day on the patio while ordering from the deli menu and/or grabbing a sweet treat.  I frequent the cupcake bar because of its variety, great taste and value.  The strawberry buttercream is to die for and the carrot cake is perfection.  I let Nona's do the baking for me so her prices to me are worth it.  Some of the newer bakeries in the area I have tried, but they don't compare in taste.  Nona's has also made beautiful custom cakes for me in the past they the crowd loved.  My family and friend from out of town know about Nona's treats and ask to visit every time. Proud to be the Yelp Duchess of check ins for Nona's.  Stop by and grab a cupcake or two, you won't be disappointed.",

I usually order a couple of cookies and small cake to test for that back home taste.   I saw a recommendation for this place, it was close enough to home so off I went. Nice store, easy parking, it had display cases and a little eat in deli area.   We were waited on promptly and we asked for a sample taste of the icings which was nicely did and one was pretty close to the taste back home.  So we bought a slice of cake and grabbed 4 cut outs.   Cut outs were stale and I would not advise, the taste was barely edible.  The cake was great because of the icing but the cake didn't wow me.    The 8\" cake was $35-$40.    Seems like highway robbery.   The cooks were $2.50 each, definitely not worth it.   They offer an almond buttercream icing, but it is very \"almondy\".  They do design whatever you want in a cake but it will cost a whole lot of cheddar.  I wouldn't go out if my way for this place if you like sweets regularly, it is too expensive.   By the way, I can have my hometown cookies shipped for about half the cost of this place.   That issue is solved but shipping a cake is not.   I need to check to see if they sell their icing, if so, I can bake a cake at home and slather it up and sit in a corner and devour it!    Then the sugar coma...",

I pulled in around 7:30pm and it wasn't busy at all. Only one table was occupied by a couple ladies. I was greeted as soon as I entered while I was scanning the desserts which all looked pretty tasty, however, I came for the cupcake bar. I recently moved to town and so I needed to find my new cupcake spot and what better place than somewhere that I can choose a different cake & icing flavor combination each time?!?! So this 1st visit I went with Carrot Cake with Almond Icing and Lemon Cake with Strawberry Icing. Before I left I looked around and saw that they also serve breakfast and lunch. I will definitely be returning to give it a try and update my review. I've now had a chance to eat both cupcakes and they are AWESOME!! Moist & rich in flavor. This is going to be dangerous for me being so close to my home. I can't wait to try more flavor combinations.",

    "text": "Pastries...FABULOUS! Cakes, cookies, specialty items...all simply wonderful! Coffee...eh. It can be hot first thing in the morning but by 9, lukewarm at best.  Breakfast...what's just above eh? Microwaved eggs with bacon bits and cheese in a styrofoam cup were just not what I wanted. And I had asked for my eggs to be a little wet and was told they could not do that because BY LAW they had to cook eggs dry but that the cheese would help it be the way I wanted it.   Wait. What? I lived in Charlotte for 25 years. Never, not ONCE, did I hear of an \"egg cooked to death\" law being put in place. I think it is more along the lines of someone only knowing how to push a certain button on the microwave. If I had understood this 7$ item was microwaved eggs...I think I'd have just had coffee and left it at that.",

My favorite hometown gingerbread men taste too sweet, after eating these delights from Charlotte. These spicy (not too spicy) little men are perfection.

My ten month old grandson and I love to watch \"run, run, as fast as you can...\" as much as I enjoyed it in my childhood with my Mama.  Thank you, again, Dominica!   Merry Christmas!",

I didn't try them But they look pled sinful and a gray assortment.  Turns out that this Location is pretty close to my hotel.  I'll remember this on my sales rotation in Charlotte.  This trip I got another dozen for a customer and Joseph always takes good care of me",
