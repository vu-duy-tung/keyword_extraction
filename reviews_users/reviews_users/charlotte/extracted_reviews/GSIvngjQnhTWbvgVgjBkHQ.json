I must say, for a burger place they are definitely EXPENSIVE, I would dare to even say over priced. They offer no meals on the menu that include a side. You must purchase everything separately. If you choose to build your own burger instead of one of their signature burgers you will be charged essentially for every topping you add. For a family of 4 to spend over $50 on burgers and fries is outrageous. I will not be returning. The food was subpar, just ok nothing fantastic. I'm just stuck on the price, and for that reason alone, in all good conscience I can't see myself in that place again.",

We were  impressed at his enthusiasm and grateful that he takes customer service seriously.  More restaurant Managers should be like him and the food is always good.  We will definitely be back.  Andrew needs a little recognition also for being pleasant and showing an \"I don't mind\" demeanor.  It pays to have great customer service.

I got the rise and shine burger with sweet potato fries. The burger is average, I would say pretty much it has the same quality and taste as the burger from Wendy's. The \"toasted\" buns are soft and soggy. The smoke bacon isn't smoky at all, it's just like the bacon you eat every morning. The whole burger is just bland and boring, it doesn't make me feel like I gotta go back here for another burger.

But the lettuce was two thin pieces. Wasn't what I was expecting. I just ended up eating it with a fork and knife. I wanted a couple more pieces of lettuce to eat like a burger. Guess I should've said extra lettuce. My son didn't like his burger, when I asked him why. He said it just didn't taste like before but couldn't explain why. But he loves their tater tots and vanilla bean ice cream. I didn't understand why American took over. I'm guessing American is a chain.. But I'm sure this won't be my burgers go to.

With the 12 minute wait, I anticipated that it was going to be just as great as the first time I tasted it.    It has changed so much and if they all taste the way mine did, I would remove it from the menu completely. I was short on time or I definitely would have turned back around and asked for something else or my money back!   Black bean burgers are solely made of black beans. This one looked like a pre-made frozen patty with very few black beans, a lot of corn and I'm not quire sure what else was in it as it looked more like a vegan pattie with black beans mixed in it. THAT IS NOT A BLACK BEAN BURGER!   I wish I would have took a picture.   Never again!",

I think the buns were the problem I'm not sure if it was that they were cold or they were old but they ruined the whole burger for both of us.",

Turkey Burger w/sweet potato fries  I always speak highly of ABC when talking burgers (turkey) this has really put a bad taste in my mouth. The first order was not well done rather medium well. My order the Turkey Burger was medium well. The sign on your menu board states ALL TURKEY BURGERS ARE COOKED WELL DONE. Since I drove 20+ minutes to pick up my order, surely I wasn't going to drive back. I have attempted to call the store several times to speak with the manager there. I believe his name is Messiah, no answer with no voicemail set up. please correct me if I have the incorrect number 704-494-7356.",

Knowing it was free burgers I knew that it would be a wait or line out the door. We made it just in time before the line started . Their burgers did not disappoint mmm We all tried a different burger an we all agreed awesome an we will be back. I had a cheeseburger , fried pickles an there Reeses cup cookie. My friend got the Hot Mess burger lol  She loved her burger an it had fries on it lol If your looking for a great burger stop by American Burger its a great burger. The staff was great an I love when a place plans for a crowd. You could tell they had extra staff for this event an our burgers didnt take long at all . When I ordered my fried pickles at the register he told the kitchen so dropped them in the fryer ASAP . Cant wait to try another burger next time",

Girl at the register was unhelpful and giving my order to her was like pulling teeth. Hubby and I both ordered boxed sets with a beer and wine subbing for drinks. Imagine our sticker shock when the bill came to 31 dollars and some change. She charged us for 2 sides of onion rings at 3.50 a piece besides full price for a pretzel bun burger and my regular with NO cheese. Husband refused to say anything, so I had to bite my tongue even though formerly in food service for many many years. The food was just ok, burgers looked like something of a box of frozen premade, and didn't really want to touch any of the condiments, everything was nasty. Don't think they ever wipe the salt and pepper shakers. What really pissed me off though, was a 31 plus bill for what should have been 20 bucks at most.",

The girl at the counter should be sweeping floors or washing dishes.   Not talking to people.   I also could tell there is a negative issue with one of the cooks as how she looked back at them to tell them to make mine med rare.   Witch brings me to my next issue.  Ownership/management should look into serving the fries in a separate basket so when you do send your order back due to not being correct they could save the fries and not have to hand over a new order of them.  May save quite a bit of cash since they have no clue how to make a burger med rare.",

Regarding the food, I had Carolina burger which was cooked great. I didn't care so much for the taste of the chili, but I still cleared my plate.   My wife had an American burger with gluten free bun. The burger was cooked great but the bread left a lot to be desired. Something we have come to expect. My son had a Route 66 which he enjoyed.

Staff extremely polite and welcoming. Staff was busy either cleaning or helping customers while stopping by each table. Our order was correct Hot and Fresh. Equally impressed as our food looked like something from a magazine. Well dressed and cooked full flavor burgers and fries. Hot fresh and ever so juicy good to the last bite.

    "text": "Thank you to the manager to reaching out to me after my last review.  He mentioned that we could still get things that BT offered, just ask for it - like the cajun seasoning.  We have since been back to American Burger a couple of times.  My husband still builds his own and I usually go for the pimento cheese burger with additions.  Fries are good too.  Still need to try the fried pickles.  After giving it a couple tries, we are really liking this place.  The only con since my last review, BT's used to be in the coupon magazine that comes in the mail and I have never seen AB in the magazine.  We took advantage of those, so we probably in turn make it out to AB's less, but we still come here and enjoy it.",

Careful, upcharge after 6 toppings and mayo is topping, tomato tomatoe on that!   Tater tots are delicious and onion rings are crispy nice sized rings.    Price point a bit high and really high adding a side.",

A bit shady...  6 onion rings tasted funny and bitter, the fries were fine.   7 never heard of blazin sauce  Overall: not heading back and can't recommend. Too many good burger places by this location.   Sad night out with the wife and kids.",

The layout is the same and the concept is similar. The burgers a about a dollar more than they were when it was BT's burger joint but more flavorful. I built my own burger and it came out fairly quickly. It had two and a half small slices of avocado which was a bit of a letdown considering they charged $2 for it.  I am sure I will return and order their mac attack burger which I missed on my initial survey of their menu.",

    "text": "I agree with other reviewers that the quality and service have declined. Also not big on spots where everyone is under 25 with NO senior management in sight.  The turkey burgers, which used to be pretty good, now are mediocre  pre-formed concoction. I was obliged to finish meal since someone else was paying. Also pretty pricey for what you receive, so it really is an extra $4.49 to add a drink and sweet potato fries to a burger already $8?  I would be totally cool if the proteins were freshly made and not popped from a box.  Dining area had some sticky spots, but will say the restroom appeared clean.  I have no plans to rush back here.",

The cashier acted like he had no clue what I was talking about and couldn't give me the discount. I sat down after ordering a burger and a beer and waited for 10 minutes without getting a drink. I went back up and showed the picture of the Facebook post and asked for my beer which had been forgotten. The cashier again acted like me wanting to use this coupon that was posted right on the entrance was bizarre and the most inconceivable and inconvenient thing that had ever happened to him. He then said that he would just bring me a separate receipt and to not worry about it. He never did and then disappeared before we left. Our table was sticky and dirty and on top of all of that, the burger made me sick. Will not be back here",
