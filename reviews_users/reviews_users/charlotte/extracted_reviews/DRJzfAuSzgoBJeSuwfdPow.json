The vegetables were not fresh and greasy. I just can't believe how awful it was.  My son however, die enjoy his meal which he had the ravioli's and ha had garlic bread on the side.  So the only redeeming quality is that the kids meal came free.  Otherwise, it was not worth the 17 dollars for the salmon meal.  Should have listened to my gut and gone to Hickory Tavern.",

Veggie calzone was 80% bread, 19% ricotta and 1% tomato and banana peppers. On top of it all, we had a 50% off coupon for second entree that they didn't honor because \"the calzone did not come with a salad\".  Did not stick around to argue. Don't waste your money.",

The restaurant features an outside eating area, traditional insides with booths and tables, bar area and something like a conference room. The waitress was kind and soft spoken but the service was lagging. Took a while to get greeted and our drinks (2 waters). One plus was the blackening of our grilled chicken.  We ordered two salads and an appetizer of bruschetta. The bruschetta was awesome although the bread was a bit over toasted and tough. We wouldn't have ordered it if our waitress told us she was bringing a basket of garlic bread with our salads. The bread was to die for I'm not gonna lie, as well our salads made with fresh lettuce, and a side of homemade ranch.  The restaurant did not scream Italian, actually it just felt like a traditional American restaurant with a menu that had some script font. Oh yes, and the two toilet seats in the women's bathroom needed replacing...whatever it's coated with is peeling off.  Food was pretty good but I don't think we will be regulars because our bill was $30, which to me is a bit much for a couple of salads and some toasted bread topped with chopped tomatoes garlic and oil.",

    "text": "Just wanted to share my lunch experience...  As usual we had a ladies lunch with just a couple of girlfriends and met at The Grid Iron on the corner of Hwy 49 & Steele Creek Road (Hwy 160).  Before we ordered our server explained that one of the specials today was Bud on Draft for $1.00.  After our nice lunch when the bill came we were charged $3 for each draft and questioned our server about it.  She said she would get it changed.  Almost immediately she came back and said her manager refused to change our bill.  We asked to speak with him and he came up and when we tried to explain to him what we were told, he was so nasty and then finally said that he would charge the server for the overcharge if we didn't want to pay the full amount.  We explained that the price we were told (not asked about the cost but were told this was their draft special for today) he refused to even listen to what we tried to explain to him.  We did not want the server to be charged for this misunderstanding and explained to the manager/owner that we patronize The Grid Iron often and that if that was his only solution to the cost difference in the draft beer was to charge the server for it, we would not come back again.  His response was \"that's okay by me because I've been in business for over 40 years and you just have to lose some customers.\"  WOW, were we surprised at his attitude considering our lunch tab was well over $50 for a couple of girlfriends eating out.  Not many lunch tabs amount to that much.  We paid that tab as rung up not wanting to charge our server for a misunderstanding and left quite a nice tip for her as well since she really did try.  We were saying our goodbyes in the parking lot when to our surprise the manager/owner followed us out into the parking lot trying to confront us some more about the Bud on Draft situation.  We did not want to cause any further confrontation as we did not know this man, and did not know what he was capable of doing, so we all just decided to leave.   It was quite the experience with this man, especially since there are quite a few restaurants right on this corner that serve a good lunch for our next girls day lunch and especially since our tab was over $50.  My advice, skip this place and head on over to Hickory Tavern, Wild Wing Cafe, Friday's or any of the other great restaurants just across the street.",

    "text": "My 93 year old father and I had lunch here for the 4th or 5th time ... service is always slow but the burgers are good and it is never crowded.   Today the service reached such a low point that I think we will not be back.   We ordered a glass of wine which took about 20 minutes to arrive.   I inquired why (place was virtually empty) and was told she was waiting for the bartender.   The bartender was rarely at the bar, and in fact was waiting on tables and had more tables than this one waitress did.   I ordered Pinot Noir and she finally arrived with a glass of white wine and had no idea that this was wrong.    After another 10 minutes while waiting for the \"bartender\" to have a free moment, I was told they no longer have Pinot Noir and that is why she brought me Pinot Grigio.    As if that made any sense at all.   Eventually a glass of Cab was produced.   It took      almost 45 minutes for them to produce two burgers.   People came, ate and left while we were waiting for this food.   I really think she forgot to put it in until I asked what was taking so long.   The bizarre answer I got to that question was that the burgers take longer because they are made to order.   Also they didn't expect so many people.     (There were 5 tables of people and the \"bartender\" was waiting on all of the others but one.)     The burgers were well-done (ordered medium rare).   My knife was dirty ... waitress did kind of say \"yuck\" but never came back with a clean one.     All in all, it was a really bad experience.    It is too bad but these service issues are easily remedied with a little thoughtful management ... and yet it gets worse and worse.    There are many other options in this area, and will get our burger fix elsewhere.    It is too bad ... we want to like this place.",

My friend noticed another customer being sat at a booth by the same hostess.

The waitress went to the hostess and a few seconds later came back and said there were none--then the hostess came to our table and snapped at us \"I THOUGHT I EXPLAINED THERE WERE NO BOOTHS\". We told her we were cold and was hoping to be relocated to a different table at least. She ignored us and walked off. She had no right snapping at us. I also want to note, both my friend and I used to be servers at a restaurant for 8+ years, so we know how customers can get, but asking for a different table should have never been an argument. We did not get to try any food because we left after her rude behavior. I hope management sees this review and reacts accordingly.",

I've been here many times in the last 5 years and I can assure you that within the last two years this place has become a great place to go. Back in 2012-2013 it struggled but now the management has turned things around. If you want a local place that's comfortable, with good food & great prices (great place to watch sports too!), go here. You'll enjoy it!",

    "text": "I have now been the The Randazzos' Grid Iron twice. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. I had excellent experiences both times. I have lived in the area for two years now and only recently been to the Grid Iron. For breakfast, the hostess was very nice, our waiter was superb, and my Breakfast Burrito was excellent. My coffee was never below half empty either! For dinner, I ordered the Mussels over Linguine. The house salad was decent. It was nice having a chilled plate... a nice touch of class. The dinner was delicious. Once again, my drink was never below half way (my personal way to judge the quality of service). The service was excellent, but the food did take a while to get out. They should have a timer in the back to get things to front of house. The food is also a bit over priced. Those are the two downfalls.  I really think this restaurant has potential to be great. Below are the things I think they should change to make it more profitable for them and for the community:  1. First and foremost, they need to identify what kind of restaurant they are. They seem to have an identity crisis going on. The appearance on the outside makes it appear as if it is just a steakhouse that cowboys or truckers go to. However, the sign says something like \"Seafood and Italian\". This is probably the reason it took me two years to get in the doors.  2. Because the restaurant is tucked away in the trees, it is extremely difficult to tell if it open or not.  3. The menu had an excellent selection to choose from. With that said... you cannot tell if they are trying to be a classy sit-down family restaurant or a sports bar.  4. They really need some kind of advertising and marketing around the Steele Creek area and especially on all forms of social media.  This is what I personally think they need to do to succeed:  They have two distinct sections of the restaurant. They should use this to their advantage to their whole identity crisis. Make one side the classy family sit-down restaurant and make the other side a more casual sport bar. Split the menu into two. Keep all the great selections, keep the pastas and fancier dishes on one side and put the burgers and onion rings on the bar side. Once they do this, they need to market the hell out of restaurant. Actually invest some money into the marketing. They need to market the fancy side to 40-70 year olds and market the sports side 20-50 year olds.   I went there today for dinner and spoke with the hostess about the issues and successes they are having. Hopefully management will see this post and take some of my advice. I really did enjoy the two times I have been there. I will most likely be back soon.",

    "text": "Breakfast review only, and it's not good.  I went here with my family this morning for breakfast, which they serve until 12.  Kudos for that, especially since we got there at 11AM.  I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.    Before I get to the ugly, here's the good: They serve breakfast until noon.  Yay. Service was friendly, attentive and prompt. They have VERY inexpensive menu options--I didn't see any meal over $7.95, and the one I ordered was $3.95.  That's wonderful!  And, no, portions are not stingy.  The coffee was bleh.  Then again, I have yet to find a breakfast place that serves coffee that isn't as pale as my favorite cup of tea.  When the coffee did arrive (promptly, I will say), we were given creamer, but no sugar.  She quickly returned with a little box of sugar/sweetener packets, but it had only 2 sugar packets, with 2 people drinking coffee.  She brought us 2 more packets.  Very generous of her.  Their menu offers a choice of grits or potatoes.  When I asked our server how the potatoes are prepared (i.e., hash browns or home fries or what), she said, \"they're chunks of potato.\"  Well, doesn't that sound yummy!  Chunks!  I assumed they were home fries then, but I was wrong.  I'll get back to that later.  Before our food arrived, we were accosted by the very loud thumping of a bass.  Where it was coming from, I couldn't figure it out.  I thought there was someone being obnoxious in the parking lot.  No.  It was coming from the bar side of the restaurant.  They had the place thumping like a nightclub.  At 11AM.  With only 2 people in the bar (why?) and 2 tables in the restaurant.  I asked the maitre'd to turn it down.  It was really annoying.  I ordered 2 poached eggs with what I expected were home fries, along with bacon and toast.  My husband and his father ordered their eggs over easy.  My eggs were absolutely perfect, but the others were fried to within an inch of their lives.  Although the yolks were nice and runny, the whites were brown, crispy and curling at the edges.  Quite hideous.  Note to chef:  there is a difference between fried and over easy.  I did not get my bacon, but several perfectly cooked (the way I like it anyway) slices arrived in barely a minute.  Now, the \"chunks.\"  They were nothing more and nothing less than cubed, fried potatoes.  Not home fries.  Not hash browns.  Just cold, over-cooked, fries.  I don't know about you, but I can't do cold fries for breakfast.  I'm sorry, but I just will not be returning for breakfast.  Maybe lunch and dinner are good, and breakfast is just not their thing--I dunno.  I will be having breakfast at home or, better yet, at Cafe 49 just down the street a little ways.  Cafe 49 makes an excellent breakfast, with divine hash browns, and the best sausage links I've ever had.  Also very very affordable.  Service is just kinda slow, but it's worth it.",

Eggs cooked as ordered , hash browns were very good. Wheat toast was nice and thick although a little too soft.  Thought food was a good value for the money.  Cons:  kind of weird because half the place looks like a big sports bar and the restaurant side seems rather small. It was not well lit, but was nice and clean. The swinging kitchen doors which are the old wooden variety like in a saloon, where very annoying. Service was very slow. Just plain understaffed.

I would not order it again, though.   My friend and I shared the artichoke and spinach dip. It was very good as were the pita chips only they were not 'normal' chips, they were much better. We also shared the mozzerella sticks and they were really good. It was obvious they were hand battered and not frozen. The dipping sauce was okay.

The server assigned to the private party room was great. He was efficient, professional and managed the group very well. The big issue for us was the quality of the food. One member of the group got the prime rib. It was overcooked and turned gray. In general, most of the groups food was bland and was not a good value (quality for price paid). My wife and I both had New York Strip steaks, ordered medium. They were cut too thin and therefore hard to control the cooking temperature. As a result they came out overcooked. They were medium well to well. They gladly cooked us two new steaks. They, again, were not cooked to Medium...overcooked to medium well. We just took them and ate very little of them. They were not seasoned well. A good steak never requires steak sauce. A-1 helped add flavor. We left 2/3 of each steak in the table. I guess we could have asked for a doggy bag and literally took them home to our dog. If not for the poor quality of the overall food experience this would be a much different review.   To recap:  1) The private room was great but never warmed up. 2) The server was as good as you could ever ask for. 3) The food was lackluster.",

First they didn't have a menu with our selections so my mother in law had to make one just so we knew what options we had. We started by ordering drinks, and it seemed ok. Until some people had not got their drinks after 10-15 mins. Then the appetizers came and that is when the waiter came to take our orders. There was 2 waiters serving all of us. We had been done with our appetizers for about 45 mins before we got our salads and then it took 30 more minutes before we got our dinner. Some of our friends didn't even get there food until about 30 mins after the first person got their meal. It was taking forever to get our food and drinks. We had to re ordering drinks since they kept forgetting about them. You would think since they knew about our group coming that they would be more prepared and have prepped or got more wait staff to help us. It was extremely frustrating that it took so long so food and drinks to get to us. Also when we complained they didn't even apologize and just took 2 meals off which with the money we spent with them was nothing. It was super disappointing to have that kind of service for what was suppose to be such a fun event!!",

The female owner  is the worst along with her husband, they are both cheap and rude they serve old refrigerated food  and please don't ask for bread. The owners recycle that also. And the tea, make sure your silverware  are clean also, bring sanitary wipes with you. I give this place a 2 because I have been there 3 tines  meaning 3 strikes on food,  I almost barf  on the quality and taste  of the food. The son cooks and from what I heard he is gross, so I give this place a 1 star.",

He wanted to see what it was like with the new ownership.  Well........my breakfast was OK, but its obvious this place is being run into the ground, again.  The prices are reasonable, that's a positive.    The service was terrible.  We had to stand in the lobby for at least 5 minutes waiting to be seated....now I wasn't bothered too much b/c we had several servers and the manager promise to be with us shortly - so we weren't ignored.    The manager seated us and told us she'd be taking our drink order b/c our server was 'tied up'.  She was pleasant and brought us our drinks on a tray...she apologized b/c she wasn't used to doing drinks...she then left our drinks on the table, ON THE TRAY.  It was kinda funny.    Enter our server.  He was, well, creepy and had to be tripping on something.  Like seriously, dude was either on something, or *should* be on something.  It was unnerving how out of it he was.  Ugh.  My waffle was good and the bacon was perfectly cooked.  The hashbrowns were also on point.  I subbed out fruit for eggs...all of that was only 8.95.  Boyfriend ordered scrambled eggs with cheese...what he got was a mound of scrambled eggs with a slice of un-melted cheese on top.  They should also be ashamed at what they called sausage...it was burnt an curled up an just looked awful.    Suffice it to say  we will not be back.",

I give them a one because they actually have the ability to serve semi cold beer, limited selection.   I've come to realize there are a ton of places like this who cater to the younger crowd, not sure if that's fair but it is what it is.  The original grid iron had very good food, this place is ruining that good name.  To many better places within a stones throw of this place that actually serve good food.",

First off I brought my dog, everyone loved him and he isn't this tiny poodle I can hold in my lap. We sat outside and the waitress put our game on the tv and was very nice to my dog.   Second, the food I ordered was awesome. I didn't order anything fancy, but their pizza was great. Everyone agreed. I'm not sure why a \"sports bar\" has such fancy Italian food on the menu. But If they simplified it maybe more people would order what I had. I mean why go to a place to watch sports and eat manicotti??? It's Weird.   Third, just a nice atmosphere. Really did enjoy my afternoon here. Hopefully more people give this place a chance. Stick to the bar food like pizza and beer. I mean really it's a sports bar why expect its Italian to be outstanding.",

Came here thinking we were going to get some breakfast but i guess we were to late for that train so we just ordered the regular bar type food they sale here. We all decided to play it safe and get simple meals off the menu. My daughter ordered a pizza and my boyfriend and I ordered the classic burgers with fries.The fries were pretty good and the burger was ok. With all that being said we didn't die the reviews here on yelp for this place is very very scary for the most part. It made it worse when we were talking to the waitress and asked about what were some of the things that were good there she named for the most part the pastas, when we asked about the burgers she mentioned well i not many people order the burgers the last time the cook made burgers was to feed to the dogs. Boy did our eyes get big like what the heck. Hilarious and scary at the same time but im glad we just all played it safe and ordered all of the what was to us the safe food. Although it was ok i don't really think this would be a place i would actually return to but the food is nothing like alot are describing in the reviews. Might i add our waitress was sweet as pie!",

I expect restaurant food to be an experience worthy of the extra money I pay to have someone cook my food. My lasagna was no better than the frozen kind you heat up from the grocery store. My Son's 10 wings maybe had a total of 1 tablespoon of barbecue sauce spread on all of them. There was smoking and corn hole outside  on the patio. Every time the patio door opened we got a dose of second hand smoke. The drunk patrons were staggering around inside the restaurant. The service was slow and mediocre. We paid 60.00 for a family of four. This experience was not worth the money.",

I ordered the salmon and could not have been more disappointed with the plate that came out. The salmon was way over seasoned, over cooked and had a suspicious smell. The veggies were almost raw and unseasoned. The mashed potatoes at least were passable. To her credit the waitress noticed that I didn't touch my salmon (though I did eat the potatoes and veggies) and offered to bring me something else. At that point my group was done eating and after the disaster salmon I didn't trust that the next dish would be an improvement but they get credit for the offer.   We stayed for a bit to check out the bar scene. On Friday nights they do beer pong tournaments which looked fun and the bartender was prompt and friendly with the drink orders. But without anything in particular to recommend the bar we left early.  Since it is so close I will probably return for drinks but not food.",

We ordered the artichoke and spinach dip with pita chips to devour in house. DELICIOUS! And the all meat pizza 14 inch, of course, and mozzarella sticks to go. All were very tasty.   They have touch tunes but when they upgraded you are unable to use the app. Bummer, but probably saves me some coinage lol  Not sure why this place gets such a bad rap.

    "text": "No frills no thrills just a nice casual breakfast spot serving breakfast from 8am to 12pm daily. This works out great when I work from home or just need somewhere close to home for after church brunch on a Sunday.  Don't expect much in terms of breakfast options though. Just the basics with no twists. Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc. This is also great when I just want a typical American breakfast.  That said, this is not a breakfast restaurant per se. It is a casual Italian restaurant that just happens to serve breakfast. Though I mustly come for breakfast I've also been here for dinner. My wife loves both their chicken and eggplant paramsen meals and often orders them for pick up.  All in all this place has a nice friendly staff and if you're in Steele Creek and you want a good tasting and filling meal for cheap for either breakfast or dinner this is a great option.  Note: This was my first time getting pancakes and they were a bit burnt today but I'll chalk it up to the fact that they were maybe rushing to switch over to lunch because my food was hot and it came out SUPER fast! I'd definitely get them again.",

Waited at least another 5 minutes for our order to be taken. They had seated another group and she took their full drink order before our order was taken. Then another table had to get up and find someone to get them a refill of drinks. We cancelled our order before the waiter had even taken our order to the kitchen. Asked how much for the coffee and he said don't worry about it and apologized. Then on the way out my husband asked the price of the coffee and she charged us for it and she acted like she was completely surprised we weren't happy   I've visited this place several times and honestly almost every time the service is questionable. My husband likes breakfast so we go there.  The food is okay not great and know you will have to wait a long time.   I just said it wasn't worth it and left.",

You can tell it's a little bit older, the decor could be updated for sure. There was lots of dust in the fixtures above. The lighting is very warm and it can use a bit of sprucing up.  It's a good family friendly place, kids are welcomed and they have a good kids menu to choose from.  The staff was all really nice and very attentive.  Prices are fairly cheap and you get a lot of food for your money. It's just nothing to write home about. My food was on the well done side without me ordering like that. I would go back again but maybe not top of my list.  It was a good change of pace but not quite what I was looking for.",

We popped into here one weekend morning looking for a simple breakfast and I can say we left satisfied.   Now it was a basic breakfast - omelets, some grits with cheese and toast - but it was hot and well cooked. Omelets were big and fluffy and service was kind. Presentation was nothing to write about but prices were inexpensive.   We can't speak to lunch or dinner, but the decor looked like it was struggling between an italian restaurant in a local country bar. The atmosphere would greatly benefit from a consistent facelift.",

First of all its not old and dates, just more of a country feel. The waitress was super sweet and the breakfast was good. Large portions and they kept the coffee flowing. The corned beef hash was super good. I have not been in for dinner but would give it a try.  I say, so listen to the bad reviews and give it a try. The place was nice, table clean and food good.  My breakfast was 10.00 so not super cheap, but good. I liked the big portion of corned beef hash they give. The eggs were perfect. I will be back",

The food has become just so-so anymore - We always have to ask for the french toast and the hash browns to be cooked well done as they have a habit of serving them very much on the 'not so cooked' side. Half the time they still come to the table not so cooked... It's also been taking longer and longer to get our food each time we go...  We can probably live with that but the biggest thing here is that the restaurant is getting VERY dated and tired. The booths are cracked and torn, the window ledges look dirty, dust up high and the mens restroom on the bar side reminds me of one of those old highway, dingy gas station stops - it's just NASTY.   Sometimes you have to put a little bit of your money back into your business to keep it fresh - this place doesn't do that. If the front of the house doesn't look fresh, there's no telling what the back of the house looks like.",

Apparently back in the day, this joint used to be a happening establishment, but a series of ownership changes, road realignments, and some bad luck changed all that.    We actually moved in across the street over a year ago, but poor reviews kept us away until we popped in by chance to get a beer.  Once we were there, it was love at first site.  I love the folks who run the bar area here.  They are some of the most personable people you'll meet.  They love their beer and mixed drinks and they love to discuss the drinks you like.  In point of fact, I'm convinced a few beers are on tap because we expressed an interest in drinking them regularly.  As far as the food, we've had the pizza.  Love it.  Also had a few appetizers and we weren't disappointed.  We have not eaten in the restaurant portion yet, but I'm happy hanging in the bar and enjoying the 10 TV's, music, and TouchTunes.    Love, love love the environment. My only criticism is I'd like still more craft beer to make this my main goto joint.  Until then I'll only be coming occasionally. But when I do come, I know I'll be enjoying myself",

They offered breakfast, to burgers, pizzas, spaghetti, steaks and seafood. And it's a sport bar.. My head spins a bit when I look at their menu. And I can understand if all the food they offered are awesome. But a lot is just mediocre.   Customer service: 3/5 it was late night when I came in. She looked annoyed.. That's all I have to say about that particular situation   Restaurant: 4/5 it's a spacious place. It can hold a bit of ppl when there's an awesome game on.. Bar is nicely located which is the center. Give everybody access and many TVs all over.   Food: 3/5 I order kids pizza for my son. As much as he love pizzas. He didn't care for theirs. That said a lot. Then I ordered him chicken Alfredo. The chicken was dry.. so of course he just pushes that to the side. I had some breakfast. Toast was burnt.. sunny side up eggs was ok. I'm glad they didn't mess that up. Bacon had some burnt, to crispy and some too soft.   Honestly I haven't been back since.. But I alway keep an eye on it to see if it will be under new management or restaurant will go toward a new direction. Because I really feel they have potential!",

Their bathroom looks like it's never been used--it's SOOO clean! About 34 years ago I had my first calzone ever. I've looked for something close to that standard ever since. Come to find out 34 years ago the calzone I had was made by the Randazzo family from their Sicilian recipe. I no longer have to search for good places for calzone... I finally found what I've been looking for all these years! My mother had the shrimp scampi and cappellini and was swooning with joy! The balance of garlic and butter was perfect. The design of this restaurant is really nice because you can sit at the bar and make as much noise as you want or you can sit on the other side of the restaurant with a couple of doors to buffer the noise and sit and have a calm conversation with a dinner partner. They also have much more quiet dining that can be reserved for up to 60 people. It's a wonderfully welcoming and nicely decorated restaurant with intensely good food!  I am so glad to have found them again",

And I ended up with an upset stomach all night.  The Parking lot is always full but isn't for the food - they are all at the bar.  Drinking here might not be bad but eat before you go!",

    "text": "I honestly don't think this place even deserves one star. To begin, we arrived on a Saturday early evening. The place wasn't that busy but the tables were dirty and when we asked for them to be washed the waiter just brushed the crumbs off into the booth which we then wiped out of the way ourselves. We asked if the margarita mix was fresh or mixed and the waiter lied and told us fresh, but when they arrived at the table it was obvious it was premixed crap. We also asked for a Gran Marnier floater ( I will get back to this). When the waiter took our order he leaned on the table with his elbows and upper body and he smelled like old booze and cigarettes. GROSS! I ordered the manicotti which came with a pathetic side salad of brown bagged iceberg lettuce and a near frozen tomato slice, all of which smelled profusely of chlorine. I didn't eat it. When I unrolled my dinnerware to eat it was dirty and the manicotti was soggy, bland and cold in the middle. My friend ordered clams which the waiter also lied and said were fresh, but they were rubbery and tasted canned. They were drenched in butter and olive oil making them unpalatable. We each picked at our plates and decided to have another drink and just leave. We each ordered another margarita and our bill. I nearly had a heart attack when I noticed on the bill that we were charged $18.00 FOR EACH margarita. That's $80 for 4 drinks. When we asked about why in the world they were so much we were told that the Gran Marnier was an additional $9.00 per drink and that there was nothing he could do about it and that there wasn't a manager available to talk to us. This happened two weeks ago and I am still furious. I have had margaritas in Los Angeles and New York with a Gran Marnier floater and was NEVER charged $18.00 for one short glass margarita. I would not recommend this place to anyone at any time. Horrible, classless service, nasty food I wouldn't feed to an animal and a complete rip off on the alcohol.",

    "text": "Went with my wife recently & she ordered scallops which, for this restaraunt, was an expensive item. They were the size of pencil erasers and over-cooked & rubbery with an \"odd taste\". After bringing this to the attention of the waitress (who was very nice) she told a manager. I was shocked to see the full price of the meal on my check! After telling the waitress again hoiw disappointed we were and that we would pay buy not be back...she told the manager again. Received a whopping 30% off the dish. This despite the fact that my wife who loves scallops could only eat maybe 25% of them at most. Will not be back despite the \"big\" discount.",

Our friends enjoyed their time too and finished their meals.  I will definitely be going back.",
