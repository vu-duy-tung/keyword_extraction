My selection was the sesame beef which was good, but I did not expect the beef to be breaded.   The menu didn't disclose that fact, but I did order that selection.  Next time, I will order another one of the spicy beef selections.  I am not opposed to returning again in the future, when I am back in town.",

We were there at high noon, and almost every seat in the house was already taken. There were a couple of people in line in front of us (you order at the counter), but the line moved quickly. My lunch companion ordered Cashew Chicken with an egg roll, I order Szechuan Beef with chicken wings. Chicken wings instead of an egg roll? Hey, all I know is that they floated my boat, the wings were excellent. My lunch mate was very happy with his choice, as I was with mine. My dish was a little heavy in carrots, which seemed like a strange addition to this entree. Did I mention that I loved the chicken wings? Not only were they crispylicious, they were crispy and delicious too! $16 for lunch for 2, including soft drinks, we had a great meal.",

They are right next to New Zealand Cafe and given my review of that place we should have gone next door to Best Wok for some fabulous food instead.  They have great prices.  Everything is cooked to perfection and it's super fast!  They are very kind and welcoming, not really a go-in-and-sit-and-eat kind of place, more of a takeout place, which is what we do anyway.  I only wish wish wish they would invest in some delivery guys/girls.  That would basically complete my life in regards to Chinese food.",

I probably grab lunch here at least two or three times a month. It's very consistent.  The staff is family, and most of the same folks seem to have been there consistently since it opened.  This is a quick place for a lunch, or for take-out. I nearly always order mixed vegetables with chicken added, but I'll occasionally surprise the lady at the register and have their special of the day, or Cashew Chicken, or Moo Goo Gai Pan, or a steamed veggie entree. (They know my face as a bartender would, and usually start rattling off my order before I do!)  They have great egg rolls and crispy chicken wings, and they will cook your food the way you like it. No MSG? Check. Less oil? Check. Hotter or milder spices? Check. Just ask.   Atmosphere is early cheap lunch booth, and seating space is limited, which is probably why they do such a great take-out business. I just go there for the food, which I crave as a guilty pleasure.",

Ordering was easy and the food was great!!  Portion sizes were HUGE.  My only disappointment was the \"firecracker shrimp\".  We were expecting more of a fried shrimp in a hot sauce (like bang bang shrimp) but it was a dish with very few shrimp literally swimming in a super sweet sauce, more like a sweet and sour sauce that was very watery.  It was barely edible.  Everything else we ate - sesame chicken, mu shu pork, dumplings, egg rolls, lo mein and fried rice was all delish!  I did hear the counter lady tell someone the fried rice has MSG in it.  I'm not sure what other menu items have MSG but I stuck with the steamed rice rather than the fried.",

A bold claim, as I've been to at least a dozen American Chinese restaurants just in east and south Charlotte alone, but I always come back to this one. Everything tastes just as it should, high quality ingredients, large portions, and its never bland. The moo shu pork is fantastic and their sesame chicken is always crispy without having globs of excess batter. And their lunch combos are enough for two meals. I really can't praise them enough and as Amanda said, if you're not in the mood to wait for a table at New Zealand next door, Best Wok is worth it.",

This is more of a take out place but they do have seats in case you want to eat in. The sesame chicken was probably the best I have had. You can ask for white meat and they will make it regular or spicy. We also got the Broccoli with garlic sauce- this actually came with water chestnuts and carrots so not sure if there was a mistake or what. The garlic sauce really wasn't spicy so ask for extra spicy if you like it spicy. The fried rice was just okay, nothing special. We will definitely be returning!",

Even with a $1.50 upcharge for the lo mein, it still only came to $8.39, AND that included a drink.  I seemed to get there at the very beginning of the lunch crowd, as it was empty when I arrived, but by the time I left, it was nearly full. Food came out really fast, and I wasn't surprised, because when I walked in, I could see back into the kitchen, and it was very well-staffed.  The chicken wings and the pork were great, but my favorite part was the lo mein. It's kinda how I judge Chinese places, as a lot of them have greasy lo mein, or lo mein that is just flavorless. But not here. They were perfectly cooked, and super garlic-y (which is a major plus for my tastes).  I can see why so many people are fond of Best Wok, and it's on the top tier of Chinese places in Charlotte for me.",

Maybe I'm spoiled now or just snobby .. but the sesame chicken everyone previously raves about in their reviews I found be VERY SWEET. Like, I couldn't finish 1/3 of my dinner combo portion of it because it was so sugary and rich. Anyone who knows me, would be shocked to hear that because I have a sweet tooth and I generally prefer things on the sweeter side but this tastes out of place and unbalanced. Blegh. The fried rice is delicious and the egg roll was ok, just a regular fast food egg roll. I will say the customer service was on point and the place was PACKED with people placing and picking up To-Go orders. I will have to try something else next time",

Not actually because it is 'as good as it gets, as there are quite a few that are as good or better.  However, the ones that are as good or better are in the Full Service/Not fast food/more expensive category.   With that said, Best Wok is 'as good as it gets in the 'fast food category'. Lets face it, nowadays there is a fast food chinese place on every street corner, most of which are either awful/passable/not bad.  Best Wok is hands down the absolute best 'fast food chinese' around. In fact, it is likely better then other full service/more expensive category. But in the fast food category, it is far superior then any other in the the same category.  The folks are nice. The food is simply terrific. Lunch specials are fantastic, cheap and more then filing. You can get an egg roll or 3 chik wings with each lunch special. Both the egg role and chik wings are excellent. You can sub out the rice which is also very good and get lomein instead for maybe $1 or so more, but its well worth. Their lomein is great. Not greasy, good texture, great flavor.   Ive eaten an awful lot of different items on their menu, both lunch and dinner, and it never disappoints. It would be difficult for me to name what I like or would recommend simply due to the fact every single meal, chicken, beef, pork, seafood etc etc....are all terrific.   Give it a shot for lunch or dinner. After doing so, you will likely cross other fast food chinese places you frequent off your list. And again, just because its 'fast food', does not mean it is not fresh or high quality. It is always fresh and always high quality and again as I said earlier, its as good or better then MANY of the more expensive restaurants.  Happy Eating",

    "text": "On my quest to discover decent Chinese food in Charlotte (how can such a big town have such a good Chinese food drought??), my search took me to Best Wok, tucked off Monroe and Sardis Road North, right next door to New Zealand Cafe. I got excited when we walked up a few minutes before noon and were greeted with a line out the door. If they're this crowded, they have to be doing something right... Right?!!   I ordered the mixed vegetable lunch special and added chicken for $1. Because I'm high maintenance, I also asked for garlic sauce instead of the brown sauce it usually comes with. Lunch comes with fried rice and your choice of an egg roll or chicken wings. I went with the egg roll and wasn't disappointed -- it and the rice were both pretty tasty! The main dish was also really good! Veggies were fresh and crisp, it was a good sized portion (enough for left overs, so ask for it to go so you already have the box!), it was not drowning in sauce. My only complaint is that the garlic sauce was on the sweet side while I was expecting/hoping for spicy.   I'll be back for sure! Looking forward to trying the sesame chicken. My friend ordered that and I had total order envy!  ***Edit to include my second visit. I went for the sesame chicken this time and holy cow, y'all! The sesame chicken is to die for! Perfectly crunchy with big, fresh pieces of broccoli. The fried rice perfectly sops up the sweet and spicy sauce. And the egg rolls are still killer. We have a new favorite Chinese spot in Charlotte!! Happy dancing over here.",

    "text": "Best Wok is one of the better Chinese Take Out Restaurants in Charlotte...and I have tried a lot. Located off of Monroe in a strip mall it can be missed, but keep in mind it is a stop you should make.  Best Wok is mainly take out, but they do have a few tables if you choose to eat in. Because I don't live in the area we decided to eat there. For those who choose to eat in, order at the counter and your food will be brought to you. I started with the Wonton Soup, fabulous! Steaming hot with two wontons that were very flavorful. Next a Spring Roll. Although a little greasy, cooked just right with a crispy shell and cooked veggies inside. For my entree, I chose the Triple Delight. Beef, Chicken and Shrimp with Mixed Vegetables in a Spicy Brown Sauce. Whoa, it was huge! But I will say the Vegetables were cooked perfectly and I loved the brown sauce. As for the proteins, they were skimpy on the shrimp but overall a good dish.  As we enjoyed dinner we did realize it is definitely a take out restaurant with a lot of regulars that the owners own. Definitely worth a visit and when I am in the area I would definitely go back.",

My wife brought me here on a Saturday afternoon, it was not too crowded.  You order at the counter and then either wait for your to go or sit and they will bring your your food.  I got sesame chicken, the chicken was crispy in a slightly sweet and wonderfully savory sauce.  I ordered mine with fried rice and an egg roll.  I am a huge egg roll fan in general and these were top of the mountain.   They are pork egg rolls, obviously homemade and fried to perfection!  I cannot wait to go back for the egg rolls.  We also had a small chicken wing, which is only $3! And wonton soup!!  The soup was perfectly thick and tasty.  Two sesame chickens with fried rice and egg rolls, side of wings, egg drop soup and the bill was only about $21!  This is the best Chinese takeout/eat In I have been to in Charlotte.  Get to this place!",

After reading some reviews, I decided to go with the lunch combo of sesame chicken, fried rice & chicken wings. They give you the choice of chicken wings (3) or an egg roll ... but I chose correctly going with the chicken wings. They have a unique flavor, I almost taste a little cinnamon on them ... very good. The quality of the chicken used in the sesame chicken was some of the best that I've had from fast/take-out places. The sauce had a great flavor. Best of all, the portion size was huggeee. I was able to make two lunches out of it.   TL;DR Give this place a try, you won't regret it! Sesame chicken FTW. $6.50 is a hell of a deal for this combination platter.",

I guess from a comparison standpoint (of what alternatives are \"in the area\") it may be better. But as far as overall takeout Chinese, this was completely average. My orange chicken was heavily battered to the point I could actually taste the cornstarch through the spicy sauce, and my husband's sesame chicken was the same situation. The crab rangoons were good, but pricey. This place didn't really live up to the hype in our experience, and I'd much rather try some other place in town then settle for this.",
