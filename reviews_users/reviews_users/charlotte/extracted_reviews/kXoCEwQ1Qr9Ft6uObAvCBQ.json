Got the three piece fried chicken and it was excellent.  Some of the best I've had in general.  I live in Plaza Midwood so not one close for me,  but I'll make the trip again very soon to give the grilled a try.  Can't remember the last time I actually posted a review but this place earned it.",

The crispy rice bowl was wonderful and the plantains were delectable.  Not so impressed with the Yuca fries they were kinda bland, but maybe that was just me cause a lot of people love them... but the regular fries were crispy and skinny like I like them.  Wish they served guacamole because that was the only thing missing from a FANTASTIC Latin fast food experience.  Will definitely be back and there is living social/groupon right now so no excuse not to try it!!",

Found Pollo Royal down the street after I gave this establishment 5 more chances...I understand that we are only human, but the last straw was visit #6 when they asked if I could wait 16 minutes for fried chicken. Umm - name of the establishment is Pollo Campero...Pollo? 16 minutes to wait from a drive-thru? Not to mention when the order was messed up on my final visit, and I went up to the counter the gentleman yelled \"What do you want!?\" This was after they messed up the order...again. The manager heard him raise his voice and got up - I asked for my money back and she apologized.  -Umm, I want you to get my order right - This was after they added a 2nd meal to my order for an additional $9.00 and instead of telling them to take it off after the cashier apologized since I just ordered one meal, I paid for it anyway and said I'll just take it. My suggestion is to go to Pollo Royal to support your Latin establishments. Viva Chicken is good as well, but I'd rather support mom and pops establishments to keep our communities thriving. Damn, I tried to support you Pollo Campero...",

Tip: due to a few bad apples,  you must redeem Living Social vouchers via mobile. No biggie. The empanada trio is the way to go you are indecisive. Of their three options, the verde one was my favorite. Yuca fries were also just right. Campero beans have a great kick and the rice was just okay. I initially  thought I would enjoy the lemon grilled  versus  fried. The fried is yummy and similar to Bonchon Korean fried, yet not fried as hard. Have different sauces which were not explained, maybe I missed the posted descriptions.  The  drive- thru was pretty busy. Will try carryout experience and compare.  My stomach still favors Viva, yet this spot is worthy for rotation.",

The man that took my order continually interrupted me and I had to repeat everything 3 times.  One of my 7 pieces, a leg, looked like it had bite out of it.  The last time I was there, the secret sauce, you get one with a 2 piece order, had about a teaspoon in a 2 ounce container.  I had to pay 30 cents more to get a container that had some sauce in it.",

The bowls are quite amazing, and they give you a bunch of food for the money. My absolute favorite is the street corn salad (extremely fresh) and the yuca fries. I also like the slaw and fried plantains. But please.. don't forget dessert. The dulce de leche empanada and the flan are wonderful. I don't even like flan, but this is more like a sweet pudding with a lovely dulce de leche sauce in the bottom. Service is immaculate the inside is extremely clean. You don't eat on paper or boxes here, they give you an actual plate. There is an assortment of juices that are also wonderful. This place is super family-friendly and extremely well run. Don't drive by thinking this is just another fast food place or any other Mexican restaurant. Give it a shot.",

I think i like the fried a little better yet the grilled is very tasty (and a little bit healthier). As a side i ordered the campero rice which was really good (but really small for 3 pieces of chicken). They also had wonderful sauces (cilantro honey mustard and buffalo based with a latin american spin). Overall it was really good. One of the better chicken spots on this side of town!

You place your order at the counter and they give you a number and bring the food to your table. One nice surprise, the food is served on actual plates... Plastic, but very sturdy and colorful. I had the boneless wings, which are actually deep-fried chunks of chicken breast, the campero beans and an order of the yuca fries.The chicken was crispy crunchy but not dry, the beans were delicious, lots of flavor with onions and chunks of sausage to give them a little bit of heat. The fries are also really crispy on the outside, but creamy on the inside. Next time I will have to try the fried chicken, because it looked really good. The service was good....it only took about five minutes or so to get our orders out to us, And they cleared the empty plates off the table once we were finished... so don't forget to tip when you pay at the front. This is a great little place, I think you'll be happy if you give it a try.",

    "text": "MOVE OVER, VIVA CHICKEN!!! Pollo Campero is the chicken king!! So I'm a big rotisserie, on the grill chicken kind of girl. My husband loves fried chicken. This place is the best of both worlds! We went in and I believe that we pretty much ordered the left side of the menu because the table was overflowing with food for just 2 people.  We had to try a bit of everything and I'm so glad that we did. Fried and grilled chicken arrived at our table steaming hot. I just don't know where to begin when describing the chicken. This chicken was so juicy and flavorful, that we couldn't get enough. When it comes to fried chicken, I can honestly take it or leave it, but this fried chicken was \"hands down the best I've ever had\" according to my husband. It really was delicious. Crispy, well seasoned, not greasy and fatty at all. The grilled chicken was absolutely incredible. So much flavor in this well marinated chicken and then the char marks and smokiness just enhanced it to another level. Their chicken was so good that I would alternate between bites of grilled then fried chicken.  Delicious, crispy, crunchy, fried yucca is one of my favorite starchy carbs and it was so worth it. The pinto beans were out of this world delicious. I wanted to lick the paper bowl that they were served in. We really enjoyed their corn salad and I was quite surprised that I would. I was expecting some corn from a can and mixed with some chopped vegetables, but they proved me wrong. I adore fried plantains and that is always like a dessert for me and theirs did not disappoint. We also ordered their empanadas and it came with a choice of 3 different kinds. All three were very good and I order them again, but for us, the chicken and their side items were the stars of the show.  Don't forget to order some of their juice that they have at the counter. They have Jamaica, guava, and horchata. The Jamaica juice is basically from the hibiscus flower and tastes similar to sweet cranberry juice. The guava is so smooth and sweet. It's really great to mix the two.  You will not be disappointed and will definitely leave overstuffed as we did because the food really is that good!",

The fried chicken was not as greasy compared to Bojangles or Popeyes. It was super crispy and I could tell the meat was fresh! The grilled one was good too! Make sure you try the cilantro sauce with your chicken, goes well with it! The 3 piece meal came with a side and choice of a dinner roll or tortillas, all for a reasonable price. Customer service was great and the restaurant was clean. I left without feeling nauseous or \"ughhh\" like I usually felt after eating at those other fried chicken joints. Will definitely be back more often!",

I walked in and was quickly (and warmly) greeted by the employees at the counter.  They offered us menus to look at and answered any of our questions.  We took some time to peruse and ordered away at the counter.  My dad and I tried the empanada trio (getting all flavors), Mike ordered the 2 piece chicken meal with one fried and one grilled.  My mom ordered a bowl.    We sat down with our number and waited for our meals to be delivered.  Meals are served on real plates which surprised us.  The best choice out of all of our meals was definitely the chicken meal, but the empanadas are delicious as well, with the bowl coming in a super close second.    Pollo Campero has different flavors of juices - they'll let you try one before you commit.  There's also a drive-thru, which I'm sure I'll try soon.  I need to go back soon!",

The corn salad is really good, it's light and refreshing and crisp.  The only other side I had was the Spanish rice and it was good too.    The staff is friendly. The service is quick.

Get the green sauce to dip your chicken in. Trust me.   On our most recent visit, I went out on a limb and got the pollo verde empanadas. Delicious.   The service is always fantastic.

At 10 PM the place had many people still dining in, which was a good sign. The atmosphere, for what is somewhere between fast food and fast casual, was modern and clean. Since we'd never been before, the cashier was helpful in guiding us in what to order, pointing out that there was a $5 special on the two piece combo meal.  I opted for the grilled chicken and upgraded to the corn salad and plantains for an extra $0.60 total. Well worth it! We also got the 3-piece empanada meal, and while decent, may not be something we'd try again. We had just tried some empanadas from Arepas Grill at Three Spirits brewing and these were not quite as good, though the filling was tasty. The empanada that really stole the show was the dulce de leche dessert empanada. I think we could've ordered a dozen of these and been happy.  The price for all of this goodness was only about $15 - well worth it. Several people had plates of fried chicken that looked amazing, so that is something to look forward to. They also appear to have online ordering, which we'd probably try in the future. Even though it is a chain, would definitely recommend for fresh food at a good price.",

I think it was Saturday midday and I paid an upcharge for white meat and still received dark meat mixed in. Alrighty. No worries.  I tried the juices and don't like any. HOWEVER, there's manzana on tap at the soda machine. It's caffeine free. Along with Root beer but they have Pepsi products.   My receipt with the green lines going through is posted. I ordered two 4 pieces with the 2 sides.  The coleslaw is not to my liking. They serve it cold with a lime base and some bell pepper pieces throughout but it's not sweet, just bland.   The rice was still divine even with the corn mixed about. The fries are exactly like any Pico Pollo I've ever enjoyed throughout the Dominican republic. Thin and slender. Done well on Saturday - overcooked and cold today (Wed July 5th @ 12:45, EST).   The manager took care of the inadvertent dark meat they gave me and I had help boxing things when it was time to go and we had leftovers. Someone as the restaurant will have to teach you how to close up the box. Yeah, honey - it's that serious. But the boxes are the BOMB as they get everything safely home. If you dine in - folks will cater to you and everyone is walking around to clean up and be helpful.   There were a few feathers on the grilled and the fried had the tallon at the end of the wings. All this aside things were consistent in taste as the first visit for the grilled AND the fried chicken isn't for me. It's bland to me and comes off like a batter you'd find on some onion rings. I used the hot sauce to help give it something.   The music sold it. Eventually BAChATa kicked in and I didn't rush to leave. Completed the survey while I was there and received an alert for 50% fried chicken July 5th/6th/7th   3rd visit - Came for the 50% and didn't realize it was fried only. Hmmmmm, I'm not a fan of the fried chicken. Ordered and the cashier had to alert me just fried. So we changed up the whole order from grilled to fried and I stressed white meat in English and Spanish. No problem.  Pulled off and reached for a fry - it was hard. Looked in the bag and noticed they're all overcooked so I wanted to return just the fries and noticed the chicken was dark and grilled. I think I have someone else's order.   Anywhoo, everyone was sweet and funny about it. So I chatted with folks. They helped me out with a picture. Got an apple soda and left with my fried white meat, empanada (that was missing in the bag) and rice this time. Yeah, I didn't trust those fries today.   Anywhoo, I'd recommend and trust things will improve so a 5 star may occur for now.... I LOVE the grilled and the flakiness of the empanada dough. It wasn't too greasy nor tasteless. It was impressive.",

    "text": "Delicious food, and decent value. Some items are overpriced for what you get, but others are good. For example the 8pc chicken family meal ($21.99) counts wings as a \"piece\" each, which is kind of skimpy compared to having more thighs or breast pieces. But it does come with 2 family-size sides (about $5 each on their own). Chicken is what they do here obviously, and the fried is delicious but citrus marinated roast chicken is good too with strong flavor. Also the chicken empanadas are yummy! For sides, the Campero Beans, Corn Salad, and the plantains were great, but the Yuca Fries were just ok (kind of stale/chewy). The dulce de leche dessert empanadas should not be missed though. So good!! Glad we found this place, but wish there was one closer to the southeast side of Charlotte.",

I tried the boneless wings which were good but definitely the weakest of the three.   The sides were awesome as well. The fried plantains are my favorite -- sweet and delicious. The corn salad was also very good.   The drinks are also very good. The Jaicama and guava are my favorite but they let you sample them all before buying one.   The desert empanada was one of my favorite things. The filing almost tasted like sweet potato, but it was dulce de leche.   The prices are also incredibly cheap and you get a good amount of food. I can't wait to come back here. This will be one of my new go to lunch spots.",

Our inaugural visit could not have gone better.  They coached us on their menu, sides, and drinks.  A few minutes later, voila, our meals appear as ordered.  Well, we made little piggies of ourselves with chicken juice drooling off our chins while we liked fingers clean.  Nothing was left except the silverware and plates.  So good.  When we think of American fast food and compare it to Pollo Campero, there's really no comparison.  Viva la Pollo Campero!  Give 'em a finger-lickin' whirl.",

Pollo Compero will absolutely be on my short list for cheap nights out.    The grilled chicken was cooked perfectly. And I do mean Perfectly.  While like both Pio Pio and Viva Chicken, I have had mixed experiences with the quality of the chicken.  It's more hit than miss.  But I've definitely had some dried out birds from those establishments.  The marinade on Pollo Comparo's grilled chicken had a bit of citrus, which my wife did not care for, but I liked at lot.   The fried chicken: Outta this world.  For me, thighs nearly always taste better than breasts.  And this was the case with Pollo Compero's fried chicken.  The thighs were truly divine.    Everything else was great too.  The rice and beans were excellent and definitely better than Viva or Pio.    And you can go wrong with fried plantains.  I loved these ones too.    I'll be back for sure.",

So, my friend, Tom, and I went there for lunch yesterday. It is definitely a fast food Latin restaurant.  The menu options are exactly what you would imagine:  chicken (fried or grilled), plantains, yuca, rice, etc.   They offer a variety of tropical drinks, including \"Jamaica\", which is what I selected.   When I checked in on Yelp, a coupon popped up on my phone that said I could get a free piece of chicken.  This was very cool and proves once again that using YELP pays off!  I enjoyed the grilled chicken, yuca, and plantains.  The atmosphere was very good, especially for a fast food place.  My only hold back was the fact that they didn't offer iced tea.  Despite the fact that iced tea is not popular in the Latin world. this restaurant is in the south. As such, they should definitely have iced tea as a drink option.  Otherwise, Pollo Campero hit all of my expectations and then some.  The flavors were immense and the vibe was great.  We appeared to be the only non-Latinos in the place, which says a lot about the authenticity of what they are doing here!   Two Thumbs up!",

The only advice I would offer to management, is that when preparing large orders for dine in customers it would be best to not prepare the orders by the registers where other patrons are talking and putting their orders in. I'm very particular about ppl talking over my food and that's a big no no.   I ordered the grand opening special to go and everything is delicious!!

I ordered the grilled chicken with campero beans. All I can say is this is some good shit! The grill chicken was so juicy and flavorful. Then to top it off you get a survey on your receipt which if you fill it out , then you can instantly get any empanadas. The chipotle empanada with the honey mustard was insanely delicious! Forget kfc and Bojangles because honestly they don't even compare to pollo campero. Trust me I like eating food and I don't play when it comes to my chicken whether it's fried or grilled and I can truly say that pollo  campero hit the mark.",

I opted for the grilled chicken with rice and fries as the side.  The chicken was Peruvian style, with a mild citrus flavor that was on point. The breast pieces were large and the meat was falling off the bone.  I honestly don't think I would miss fried chicken if all chicken could be this good.

They stopped serving the cilantro sauce and honestly the one they replaced it with has absolutely no taste it is very disappointing. The rolls are never in the bag or the sour cream for the plantains each time i have come back since my first review.  its so disappointing since the chicken is still very good but just not worth the hassle anymore so make sure you check everything if you do decide to come here.

On the plane back home, half the travelers had HUGE boxes of Pollo Campero aboard, destined for the states. Now I know why.  Both the fried and grilled chicken are simply amazing. If there is better, I haven't found it. The sides are all delicious too. Opt for the Mexican street corn as your side. And go half grilled/half fried so you can try both styles. I'm so very happy one of these is not only in the states, but just down the road!",

Our food came out within maybe five minutes of ordering, the order was right and the food was delicious!   I told my husband we can definitely come back! This is why it is important to give restaurants a second chance. I am glad I decided to come back both the food and the service was amazing.",

It has slipped and is not what it used to be.   Multiple times, they've left items out of my order.  The wait times for food have increased, although the restaurant has not been busy.  Today the young lady at the drive thru couldn't understand me in English or Spanish (Im fluent in both).  She was very flustered and clearly showed her discontent towards me at the drive thru window when I asked if the condiments were in the bag.  I proceeded to check my order and the wrong type of beans were in my bag.  The receipt showed the correct order.  The food was pretty good, although there weren't any lime wedges with the chicken.  To me, now Pollo Campero blends in with the rest of the food establishments with a drive thru, in the meh category.",

That created a high class problem however. The food was so inexpensive that I we had to struggle to use the entire $20.  My wife wanted all wings but they unfortunately have the servings pre-made and don't allow substitutions. No big deal. They do however allow you to mix and match between their Citrus grilled chicken and fried chicken. We wanted rice but unfortunately there were out but the upside was that the up-charge for the signature size was only $0.30. We paid less than $10 for our $20 Groupon and only ended up paying $2 afterwards. That's great because I had some food leftover to take home.  I had a three piece breast and wing combo but it only comes with one side. Additional sides are very inexpensive however. I got the Yuca fries and sweet plantains. It did take forever to come but In fairness they did say that the grilled chicken would be another 10 minutes. I was however surprised when they stop by the table to say that the fried chicken would also be an additional five minutes when we had already been waiting for about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait though.   Aside from soft drink beverages they have what they call fresh drinks and the options are guava, Jamaica (fruit punch) and Horchata which is a traditional cinnamon and not Mexican drink. It's milky creamy and delicious. It was my first time having it but I really enjoyed it.",

    "text": "Whenever I travel to a city that I have never set foot in, I check out local Groupon deals. You can save a bit when you do. It also makes you discover great food and figure out where things are.   I bought two Groupons before I headed to Charlotte. One of them was for Pollo Campero.   I have been on a fried chicken kick for a bit. My eyes lit up when I found out that this place serves fried chicken. More importantly, this place also has empanadas, which is a weakness of mine.  The funny thing about both restaurants with Groupon promotions is that I had a difficult time opening the main door at both places. Perhaps not working out for nearly a week made me weak and seek nourishment. A female staff member helped open the door for me.  I had reviewed the online menu before coming here. I looked at the menu again to make sure that I had everything.  I ordered the following items: - Four pieces of chicken - half fried and half grilled with a lemon herb mix - Campero beans - Campero rice - Coleslaw - Empanada trio - Peruvia verde, chicken chipotle, and Latin buffalo - Flan  The chicken meal comes with a tortilla. It was a lot of food for $20. I went over by a dollar.   There is a waiting area in the restaurant for those who are ordering takeout. You can also dine in. Since it was my last day in Charlotte, I wanted to have dinner in my room and start packing for my morning flight out the next day.  Pollo Campero is like the Spanish version of Popeyes, but with more sides and dessert options.  The verdict? Both the fried and lemon herb chicken pieces were delicious. The meat was tender, flavourful, crispy, and juicy. So good! I could simply eat the chicken and call it good.  I loved the Campero beans and rice. They complemented the chicken beautifully.  I was not a fan of the coleslaw, though. It was supposed to be creamy, but it was a mix of that and water. I simply didn't like how it tasted.  I didn't enjoy the flan, either. I was disappointed. It was too sweet for my liking.  There was so much food that I ended up taking the empanadas on the plane and eating them there for lunch. All three flavours were amazing. I liked the spiciness in each of them. The chicken was yummy in all of them. I wish that I had ordered more of them instead of the flan.  If I am ever back in Charlotte, I would come here for more delicious chicken and empanadas. I'm so glad that I found this place on Groupon.  (145)",

The food is fast, fresh and cheap while the people friendly, what more could you ask for? I've noticed that they've opened quite a few locations, but I've only been to the South Blvd location. I can't imagine the experience being any different, but thought I should mention :)  I've tried...  Entrees: 1. The Campero Fried Chicken 2. Campero Grilled Chicken 3. Grilled Chicken Bowl 4. Empanadas (All 3 - Chipotle, Verde and Buffalo)  Sides: 1. Campero Rice 2. French Fries 3. Street Corn Salad  4. Plantains 5. Yuca  Drinks/Dessert 1. Guava/Passionfruit 2. Flan  Of those mentioned, my go-to is the Half Chicken Special. You can decide between grilled, fried chicken or half and half. I personally really enjoy both, just depends on your mood. I do have to say the grilled is more flavorful! The special comes with 2 sides and my favorites are probably the campero rice and french fries. Don't get me wrong, the plantains and yuca are delicious, but the portions are smaller :) I didn't care for the flan, but definitely recommend the drinks! Will be back soon Campero!",

    "text": "Such tasty food! I went here a couple times when they first opened, and I wasn't impressed with the quality:price. I've been trying them a lot more lately after returning from California where I binged on Pollo Loco. This is no Pollo Loco, but it is getting better with time. I've had the fried and grilled chicken, but the grilled is my favorite! It's so full of flavors and has beautiful colors which make for a great presentation.  They've been running specials lately, so it's much more affordable than when they first opened. What's pictured is my go-to meal lately, and an example of those specials. I ordered the 3 piece chicken -you choose from fried, grilled or both; one side (Campero rice is my fave); and your choice of roll or corn tortillas. I always opt for the second, and you get two of them. All of this is $5, which isn't bad at all. No drink is included, but there are choices of horchata and soft drinks. The original horchata is really tasty. It's a milk-based drink with vanilla and cinnamon flavors. I tried it for the first time a couple days ago, and while I loved the rich flavors, I couldn't get used to it while eating my meal. It's definitely more of a Starbucks, iced coffee-type drink.  My sister loves the black beans and plantains, but I can't afford the premium sides (which plantains are), so I stick with what comes with the special! Service is great, but it can take a while to get your order sometimes. That part is worth it, bc the food is always hot and delicious. Pretty good place when you're looking for a drive through with bold, fresh flavors and want to skip the burger joints.  My picture was taken after I started eating. The rice isn't pictured, but it has cilantro and sweet corn. I used to love the creamy cilantro sauce that they gave, as I'd dump it inside my rice. However, the last three or four times, I've gotten a thick ranch dressing instead. When I asked for the creamy cilantro sauce during my last visit, the girl sort of looked at me like I was crazy and it never existed. For that reason, along with the pricing (outside of promotions), I'm giving this place 4 stars.",

We were next in line and there were 4 women in a group in front of us. There was another girl behind the counter that was clearly doing the register as well but she was doing something else. A lady came in behind us while we were waiting and waited a bit. She finally went passed us and asked the girl at the register about placing an order and asked if we were in line. The girl at the register looked at us and said NO! And took her order. Are you serious? Finally, we ordered after her which was extremely rude and when we were asking her questions she was very short and didn't really want to answer. We told her we wanted the empanada trio which comes which all three to try. She kept asking us which ones we wanted and we were telling her we wanted the trio-one of each. She didn't seem like she knew what was on the menu.  I was asking her about the sauces (the green one and the pink one) and what flavors they were and she said \"Oh there is a green one and a pink one and you get those when you get your meal.\" So I asked what flavors they were and she said one was cilantro and she didn't know what the other flavor was. Strange since I saw so many people get the pink sauce. We sat down and waited on our food and the food was served to us. The that dropped off the food was nice but I noticed we only got the pink sauce. We went up and asked for the green sauce as well to try.   Overall, the food was good. I liked the fried chicken better than the grilled chicken. I also noticed that several people that ordered after us got their food before us and we all looked like we had similar items. The service is lacking.",

They had a great selection of sides and juices so you have to be careful because all that deliciousness can get your bill up in a hurry.

To begin you can choose between fried chicken and grilled chicken and although the fried chicken has a great crisp and bite - the grilled chicken is phenomenal. The grilled chicken has grill marks and is flavored or spiced with several mouth watering tastes. The menu comes in the traditional breast and wing or 3-5 piece combo with sides. The sides are OK. They are not my favorite part of the menu. But I imagine that is because I do not enjoy cold sides and I would prefer corn on the cob instead of corn kernels. But the sides are really flavorful and my wife enjoys all the sides. Fries. - I think they have Yuka fries or they do not have fries all together. I really can not remember because I did not order fries which sucks as a fry lover :( That's pretty much the only down side to this whole place... they need seasoned crispy fries-   I am sure to update this review because Pollo Campero is really affordable and provides a solid stable meal.",
