This time I got the Wonton soup and he got beef and broccoli which comes with fried rice and an egg roll, which he shares with me :). There is plenty of food to share between 2 people.   The service is spot on and very quick. I think after we ordered it probably came out in 5 minutes. After all was said and done, our check was less than $9, and we were both very satisfied.",

    "text": "Not authentic Chinese by any means, but definitely a great place for a decent, inexpensive meal. The huge, satisfying portions will run about $7-10 and they come with white or fried rice & a veggie roll, egg roll, or chicken wings! I have tried quite a few things over the years from veggie lo mein, steamed vegetables, and veggies & tofu in garlic sauce, but my favorite will always be the sesame tofu. There aren't any vegetables in it, but I add some for $1 extra. I also tried the steamed vegetable dumplings once. They were pretty good, & HUGE, but a weird seafoam green color, which was kind of off-putting. On my last visit, I tried the general tofu but it wasn't spicy at all so I just ate the dried chili peppers that were in the sauce. Some things seem like a good idea at the time but eventually you will find out it was actually a pretty shitty idea..  BF's go-to order is the general scallops with white rice & chicken wings. Both of our meals run about $20 including the tip which is a STEAL. For some reason, we usually end up here on Sundays and this place is packed! The ladies who work here are very sweet, but because it's so busy, they may be a little short with you, which I don't really mind, I'm not here to make friends. Service is quick & our drinks are constantly being refilled.   If you like modestly priced, dinosaur-sized portions of non-crappy Americanized Chinese food, this is the place to be!",

Most of these folks speak no English or very little, and they are usually busy running around like mad so they don't stop by every 5 min's asking if everything is OK , which is fine by me, I don't come to a Chinese or ethnic restaurant for the banter w/the staff:)  Also one biggie for me; the prices have hardly changed in the last 5-6 years at the one I go to on park Rd. The New Tze chicken has been $5.95 as long as i can remember, a big plus since everywhere else you go prices have in a lot of cases almost doubled",

I've been familiar with Taipei South for about 8 years now and I've never once seen or heard any advertisement for the place anywhere. It's just not needed. Even with the terrible location the place thrives.  And for good reason. The food is always good and plentiful (best eggrolls in town). The service is always quick. The staff is back to fill your drink while it's still half full. And all this for the price of a fast food meal.  I left that part of town about 3 years ago but still go back probably once a month. I just haven't been able to find a Chinese restaurant in center city that lives up to it. They're all either not as good, more expensive or both.   The only conceivable complaint I can see being made of this place is that the wait staff can be a bit terse and may make some feel rushed. I choose to interpret this as fast service as they do everything quickly but never make me feel pressed to leave if I linger in conversation after the bill has been paid. I think they just know that nearly all their customers are regulars and figure they know what they want almost as soon as they sit down.",

WELL:  1) All dinner combos come with a hearty entree, a big mound of rice, and a side item. 2) The combos cost anywhere from $7-10 bucks: affordable! 3) Customizable entrees: choose the sauce and the veggies!  I personally went with a spicy black bean sauce, and elected chinese eggplant as my vegetable of choice, served alongside the trio of beef, pork, and shrimp.

Don't expect genuine Chinese food, this is American Chinese food -- just like most Chinese restaurants in this country.   Now here's the hangup I have with Taipei South. Customer service is lacking. The ladies that work the front aren't mean people at all, so let me make that point. But it's always a mixed bag. Sometimes orders are quickly placed, drinks always topped off, and food comes out quickly. But other times it can be the opposite. I'll use my last visit as an example:  The waitresses said little to nothing (which is the usual case). They did bring out a little jar of Dr Pepper so I could refill my cup faster, but the waitress at one point came by and took the jar and used it to refill another customers drink who didn't even know I had been using that jar... Then she put it back on my table. It was also past peak lunch hour (1:45 and 1/3 full) yet I waited 12 minutes by the time I got my check to when I got the receipt.  Really this place just needs to be more hospitable. It would go a LOOONG way. Maybe they're content with where they're at? I'm sure they do fine since they serve good food. But it's no secret friendly and unforgettable service creates a memorable experience for the customer, something that causes them to always come back. I would love Taipei South to figure this out.",

It is coated in their signature sauce that is the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The portions are generous and the prices are great.  The last time I was there I decided to eat there and that is the only reason why I would not give it 5 stars, the dining room could use a bit of an update, but as far as the food goes it is always spot on.",

    "text": "I have been looking forward to trying this place for quite some time now. My first visit was a bust because they were closed but this time was perfect....a rainy Saturday afternoon what could be better than Chinese food?!!?  I'm a little ashamed to say the reason I've been so anxious to try this place, it's for the chicken wings. Yep. I said chicken wings. They offer them as a side here!!!   Say What!?!?   The menu is simple, you chose a meat and then a sauce to accompany them. They have your pretty standard variety of meats: chicken, shrimp, beef, scallops, tofu etc. However, the selection of sauces is great. There are tons of options to tickle your tastebuds.   I started with the vegetable soup. It was pretty standard. A really good broth and steamed crunchy veggies and tofu. The crackers that they served with the soup were very interesting. I'm used to the wonton strips; but these crackers were crispy  and blended well with the soup.   For my meal I chose the Dual (two meats) with chicken and shrimp. I went with the steamed rice, chicken wings as my side (of course) and added an egg roll. I kept it simple and picked the spiced brown sauce with broccoli with a request to make it extra spicy.   The food was out in no time. The brown sauce was really good, not as spicy as I hoped but still very tasty. The chicken and shrimp were plentiful. In every bite I had either a piece of chicken or shrimp and the broccoli was cooked perfectly. The egg roll was pretty standard, but still tasty. And those chicken wings that I had been waiting to try....were as great as I expected. Super crispy, cooked just the right way and they were actually seasoned really well. Totally worth the hype.   Service was great and the prices were just right. I definitely recommend giving this place a try!",

Needless to say, this snobby Big Apple foodie wasn't keen about trying Chinese in Charlotte but I was overruled. Ok not overruled, just figured I'd save my bullets for another battle.  We get inside and the ambiance is simple--nice, clean and more spacious than I thought from the outside looking in. Waitresses--and a kind man who may be the owner--all greeted us and we were sat quickly.   We hadn't even sat down when the lady asked us if we wanted drinks. Seriously. That kinda put me off but that turned out to be the only blip in what was a surprisingly good night. Food came out super fast which was also disturbing to me but it was actually good I thought to myself as I took my first few bites. Really good as I helped myself to a second plate.  20m later all 6 plates of food we were sharing family style had been devoured. Authentic Chinese? No, more like the American kind and although I'm more fond of the former, this one really hit the spot. Cheers.",

We all ordered white rice but when one order was brought out, it was served with fried rice. (The tofu veggie dish). The server gave her a face when she reminded her she ordered white rice. My friend's chicken and broccoli with cashews looked good, but she had to ask for additional sauce since it didn't have enough on it.  My orange chicken was not as good as I remembered, but it was still pretty good.  I wish they would put some veggies in it.  I thought I remembered it having carrots and or water chestnuts in the past, but it was just orange peel and chili peppers with the sauce. I could be mistaken though. The crab rangoon continues to be my favorite thing on the menu and at $4.75 for 6 it's a good deal. The duck sauce is great with it.",

We got 2 appetizers, 3 entrees to share, and 2 drinks a piece and spent right around $50 all while leaving with 2 full meals to take home with us-that's literally how much food you get with these dishes. For the quality of the food to be so good and the prices so low, I was really in my personal heaven eating here.

It is known for its consistently good food, superb service and affordable prices. Anne, the manager, can be regularly seen walking for table to table, cheerfully checking on guests, most of whom are regulars.  Except for some minor price increases over the years, the simple menu has had few changes. All of the standard \"American\" Chinese fare is offered. Both lunch and dinner include your choice of steamed or fried rice AND egg roll, spring roll or chicken wing. Chicken wings are incommonly good and fried golden brown with the perfect crunch. Egg rolls and spring rolls are above average. The usual soups are tasty and, as of my last visit, run less than $2. Unfortunately, brown rice is not on the menu.  Portions are large for lunch or dinner with only a slight up-charge for dinner. The dining room is normally packed but don't let a wait scare you as they do a great job moving diners through. Dining room itself is attractive but showing its age somewhat. Sanitary rating is consistently in the low to mid-90s.  You can't go wrong here. At the risk of increasing my own waiting time, I highly recommend it!",

You can get your entree and a drink for about ten dollars a person.  Each entree comes with either white or fried rice and your choice of an egg roll, spring roll, or chicken wings. I've been here with friends and family over the years and everyone is a returning customer. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because it's nothing fancy on the inside and the staff isn't very friendly.  It's always crowded but they get you in and out the door in a hurry.

All dishes come with fried rice or white rice and chicken wings or egg roll. The rice was flavorful, and I had a very generous amount of it. I was also given plenty of plump, juicy shrimp, which made me very happy. The vegetables and sauce were great.

I really appreciate their use of quality ingredients and how quickly they fulfill their orders. I stopped by today after work because it was on my mind ALL OF LAST WEEK! I ordered:  1. Orange Chicken 2. Beef with Chinese Eggplants in Garlic Sauce  3. Hot and Sour Soup  The orange chicken were actual HUGE pieces of chicken rather than blobs of batter and they use real orange peels for the flavor! I love getting anything with their garlic sauce. This is usually my go-to when I'm here. I usually do the beef with garlic sauce which comes with a variety of veggies or I highly recommend just the eggplant in garlic sauce! It's a great vegetarian option and honestly, I don't even miss the meat! You can also add eggplants to whatever you order with an up-charge. The Szechuan and Black Pepper sauces are also very delicious! With every entree, you can choose between the chicken wings, an egg roll or a spring roll as a side. They're all delicious, but I usually go with the chicken wings. Can not recommend this place enough! Oh, and thank you Taipei South for the 2 sets of utensils.. even though all of the food was for me and me alone :)",

    "text": "This place is consistently good.  In the past, I always have ordered the orange chicken.  I love the orange peel in the sauce. I wish it had a few veggies though.  So this time I ordered General Tso's Shrimp.  It had red peppers, mushrooms, and broccoli.  I asked for it extra spicy and got what I ordered, it was perfect. It comes with chicken wing, egg roll or spring roll.  They accidentally gave me chicken wing but let me keep it and also brought my egg roll. The chicken wing was nice and crispy with a good bit of meat.  It needs some flavor though, I'd recommend asking for some hot sauce.  The egg roll was nice and crispy.  My friend ordered chicken with green beans and fried rice.  She loved the crispness of the green beans.  Personally I like them more cooked, but she was happy. I got the sweet and sour soup.  It was REALLY GOOD. Lots of flavor and tasted very fresh.  My friend got the egg drop soup and liked it a lot.  Best part, with tax my bill was only $12.  Great value for really good food. I've been going here for 20 years and it's always a classic.",

I've always heard lots of good opinions of this restaurant & was finally curious enough to try it for supper. With my wife in tow we headed out Saturday evening. The restaurant was crowded but we got a booth without a wait. Everyone was happy & friendly. We were seated and had drinks within five minutes of being seated.  After looking at the menu my wife ordered egg drop; soup, fried pork dumplings and orange beef. I ordered hot & sour soup, steamed vegetable dumplings and a trio of shrimp, scallops and beef with a Szechuan sauce. Everything from the soup to the entrees was very flavorful & hot. I really dislike when food comes out of the kitchen and its lukewarm from sitting under a lamp at the pass. If I had to be critical of anything it would be that the dumplings had a bit too much dough. On the other hand they were huge! The entrees were also a very good size and we had to take home about a third of our plates, each. We will be returning. The prices for the dishes was very reasonable.",

If you've seen my other Asian/Chinese reviews, I base places a lot on the Wonton Soup...so, with that said I of course had to start with Soup. The broth was great, served with two very large wontons and scallions. Very good. And, I love they serve their soup with crispy chips...  As for my entree I unfortunately cannot remember the name of the dish, but it was Shrimp, Chicken, Pork and Beef with Mixed Vegetables in a brown sauce. Huge portions and the dish was great, the veggies were all cooked to perfection and the meats were all great. The meal comes with a Spring Roll or Egg Roll and my waitress recommended the Spring Roll, perfect choice.  Overall, Taipei is a great spot when your craving Chinese with great service and prices!",

This is a Family friendly environment and not anything fancy.  Meal prices run from $6-8.50ish. Food comes out hot, just like you order it and good size portions.    A downfall to this restaurant is that the wait staff is on a mission to get your drink and food order in as soon as possible and very much in a hurry to rush you out of the door as soon as your food arrives at your table! 9 out of 10 times, I call ahead and I order my food to go.  I feel it's the best way to go - my order is usually ready in 10-15 minutes, even when they are busy!  Never had an issue there.   If you're craving Chinese food, give 'em a try!",

    "text": "First of all, This review is only base on lunch time because I've never been there at dinner, HOWEVER this place been open for a LOOOOONG time as far as chinese restaurant goes in that area, this place is PACKED for lunch almost ALL the time in the weekdays but the service is incredibly fast and the food comes out quick too so the wait is usually minimal or none at all.  their lunch special is only around $6-$7 so very reasonable and its always delicious i've been there for probably over 30 times for lunch and i've never had a dish i dont like,  their meat, their sauces is very flavorful! if ur in the area and have a thing for some good ole chinese food for lunch, give this place a shot! u wont be disapointed!",

I don't typically go here - it's a little out of my way but today reminded me to go back! Service was great!  Taipea South is located in the Food Lion strip shopping center behind Burger King and across the street from Lowes (Johnson Road near Highway 51).",

However, none of the dishes looked Taiwanese. The menu is typical Americanized Chinese food. Maybe there is a secret menu?  Can anyone who is familiar with Taiwanese food and not just standard Americanized Chinese food comment?  thanks!",

Also, I ordered take out recently, picked it up myself, and payed with a credit card. I found out a couple of days later that they took it upon themselves to add gratuity. It was kind of shady business practice so I won't go back.",

We usually dine at The Great Wall and I have to special order my Orange Peel Shrimp because it's not on the menu and sometimes they give me flack. I found my choice item on Taipei South's menu and boy was it cheaper! My meal was large in portion and even came with an egg roll. I must say I was well pleased with the taste of the food and I will be back!",

    "text": "My friends and I were looking for a decent but relatively inexpensive Chinese restaurant and we found it in Taipei South.  We arrived around 730pm and while the place was bustling with patrons, we were promptly seated with no wait .  The service was extremely efficient, with appetizers and soups brought within a few minutes of ordering.  There was a bit of confusion when ordering some sweet and sour sauce and this took quite a while to figure out, but other than that the food was well worth the prices (ave of about 6 or 7 bucks per dinner!).  I'd definitely go back for some inexpensive, decent Chinese!",

Arrived at 9:35pm, and they told us the kitchen was closed. Most restaurants have to serve until their closing time (which was 10pm). Maybe it's just Chinese places that stop serving? I'm not sure. But I'm not used to walking into a place BEFORE they close and being sent away. They lost my business for good. I know I should have called beforehand. I normally wouldn't go to a restaurant that close to closing time, but when I do, they at least take my money!",

I went again a few weeks later and ordered something different and again everything was amazing! Their hours are a little weird so make sure you look them up before heading over. My fav is the black pepper chicken. The chicken is perfectly cooked, seared not boiled like most Chinese and the veggies are perfectly tender with just the right amount if bite.",

I love how you pick a style then pick a meat.  Generally speaking, I never get chicken when doing cheap chinese because it is always strange mystery meat, but I love the beef.  I believe I get the beef with Garlic Sauce.  Oh yea... Real good.  Check them out.  You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Never again!  I have been ordering take-out and eating here for many years and it used to be ok for the price but the last 3 times we have eaten here it was absolutley horrible.  My husband and I and 2 children went inside to eat where they stuck us at a table in the back corner where the walls were greasy and filthy.  My husband would just assume not eating it and leaving but I am a little more forward and expect good food when I pay to go out so I went to the owner that usually stands in front of the restaurant and let her know very discretly and  nicely that all 4 of us were unhappy with the quality of food. She then told me that there is NO WAY that I could be unhappy because her food is the best and always fresh.  She very loudly walked to our table and stuck her hands in my sons chicken fried rice and ate it....agreed it was a little dry and would only give us our money back for the 2 cheapest meals although she could clearly see all 4 dishes were untouched.....UNACCEPTABLE and so so UNPROFESSIONAL!!!! Fried rice tasted like it had been sitting there for 10 days and you couldn't taste the difference in my husbands beef with garlic sauce and my hunan chicken.  The chicken wings use to be one of the highlights of going here. NOT ANYMORE.  I read today in south charlotte weekly that they recieved a grade of 90.  They also pulled out the booth right in front of us and were vaccuming as we were trying to taste our food.  VERY rude people and DISGUISTING food.",
