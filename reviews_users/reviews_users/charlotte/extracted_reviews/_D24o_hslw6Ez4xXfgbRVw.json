My friend ordered a Greek salad and as she's eating she found a worm moving around in her food she then got up and went to the bathroom to vomit. As my friend was dying in the bathroom I then called over a staff member to make her aware that a worm was in the salad. The young lady had no remorse or sympathy to the fact that we had a live insect in the food. She looked at me rolled her eyes and said \"what will you like us to do?\"  I asked to speak to a manger she then proceeded to tell me that there wasnt  a manger there. A more decent place would have apologized. But no instead we still had to pay for the Greek salad with a side of worms. This place is a dump and should not even be in business. We don't want restaurants like this in our area!!!!! Keep you nasty attitude and salads away. P.S Any decent restaurant should have a manager in duty to make sure the guest are recovering a proper dining experience.",

Signs everywhere saying, \"We work for tips.\" However, aside from bringing the food to the table they really don't do much to earn a tip.

The noticed that the cafe was loaded with teenie-bobber couples, probably from the high school across the street.  Oh well, I spotted a few quiet places available for me to enjoy my meal.    The cashier seemed unenthusiastic and her she wore her hat so low that it looked like she was trying to hide something.  I ordered the falafel with a side of fries.    The food popped up within ten minutes and the place was crowded!  I enjoyed my waitress, she had a sweet personality and quick on the refills.  The unsalted French fries were huge and steamy and the Falafel was hot and crunchy.  I do have a suspicion that the fafalel was frozen and recooked, but good nonetheless.  They played Smashing Pumpkins, Honey, and I thought for a minute about dessert, but I had to run.  Baklava next time!",

They close a week or two out of the year to usually clean/repaint the place but it always meets south of expectation.  The tables are loud, the chairs they use heavy as anything and louder still.  The service is usually wage (or sub) high school students and you know how that can go.  That's not what it's about though.. it is the food right?  I think they have the best gyro meat in town.  While it's not like leaving the country and having lamb/steak on a spit it is served fresh and well spiced.  Others in town that you get gyros from will serve you some Cisco food service derivative which is freaky.  Their Chicken and kabobs are also juicy and never dry.  You could rank a lot of complaints on this place if you weren't careful but I've been to them long enough and a repeat customer for probably 15+ years and they continually draw me back a few times a month.",

The service leaves a lot to be desired. It's slow, and the high-school age staff are often a little fussy about being interrupted from whatever it is they were doing to have to work.   One of the waittresses flirted openly with my date in a way I found pretty yucky...it was a bizarre combination of indifference to providing timely, quality customer service while fawning over my man...Boo to her.  If you've got time to wait, though, and you're not with a dashingly handsome man, and you're willing to suffer through some sloppy service to get to the promised land of souvlaki and spanokopita, Akropolis is a good option. It's pretty affordable as well, so it's a nice option to the Taco Bell across the parking lot in the Arboretum.",

I brought home some chicken strips home for my son (in their styrofoam takeout containers) and the chicken strips melted through the styrofoam because the cooks put them in there when they were still too hot.  He had eaten about 1/2 of the meal before he had noticed the holes at the bottom of the container.  We were extremely concerned of the chemicals from the stryofoam that our son may have just injested and told him to stop eating immediately.  When i brought the container and remaining food back to the restaurant i expected either a refund or an alternative option to the food we were returning (since the thought of eating styrofoam had blown his appetite for that particular dish).  Restaurant policy is replacement of the same exact dish, regardless of cost.  I expected a more customer friendly policy.",

We started with the hummus... it was cool and creamy served with warm pita bread, I would go back for this alone. I ordered a plate that came with a small greek salad, steak fries and a grilled chicken skewer with a side of tzatziki. The salad had fresh crispy romaine, some of the best goat cheese Ive had, onions, olives, carrots (maybe? cant remember!) and cukes. The chicken was very tender and the marinated was good, the tzatziki was cool and creamy and worked perfectly with the dish. For a little over $7 this was a great deal. BF opted for the burger and fries and he enjoyed the burger, nothing fancy but he said it was better than he had expected.  Service was good, they came by often to check on us and made sure our drinks were refilled. We enjoyed sitting outside, relaxing and enjoying a good meal.",

The grape leafs were run of the mill. No lamb gyro or kabab? Only beef and chicken, I have no use for a beef Gyro. The funny thing is that at the Charlotte cafe right next door they serve lamb Gyro and they don't even claim to be a Greek eatery.   Not convinced",

We ordered 2 diet cokes with our meal in to go cups.  We stood at the counter and watched the girl fill our drinks as we thought we would save her the trouble of bringing them to the table.  She filled up the first to go cup with regular coke and put a lemon in it (which, I think, usually goes into a diet coke). So we thought maybe this isn't our order.  We watched as she filled the second to go cup with regular coke and again put a lemon in it. Hummm, surely this must not be our order.   She turned around, we told her we were waiting for 2 diet cokes, and even asked, Are those diet cokes? and she starts to hand them to us.  I told her, we just watched you fill them with regular coke.  She just smiled, never said I'm sorry...or... oh I made a mistake...or... isn't that a funny joke to switch regular coke and diet coke, nothing.  She emptied them out and filled them with diet coke as we watched her.  After we sat down, another waitress came over and was very apologetic but with servers like the one who thinks it's funny to fill orders with coke when diet coke was ordered, we probably will not go back.

    "text": "Delicious Hidden Gem. Husband and I took a chance on this place a couple months ago and so glad we did: FOOD: Freshly made. Highly recommend the gyros. This restaurant has a big variety of options - everything from chili to salmon kabobs to baklava. While this may seem unfocused to some, we found the options delicious.  Parking: It is located in a very busy shopping center and the parking can be challenging.  Atmosphere: It's a diner/hole in the wall atmosphere - tables are very close together but it's cozy. Local hint: There is a small lake behind the restaurant - highly recommend getting the food to go and enjoying it outside with a water view.",

The inside is painted to look like a Greek villa complete with a great view of the beach, which I thought was cute.    As far as the food goes, I was ready to mark them down a bit for having slow service but then the food finally arrived and all bad thoughts were banished.  My chicken suvlaki kabobs were cooked perfectly and served with fresh, hot pita bread, and Greek dipping sauce.  This restored my faith in them because even though the place was nearly full and they were understaffed (I saw a help wanted sign in the window) they took the time to make sure every dish was done well.    They also have some American fair, like hamburgers and such for those afraid of international cuisine.",

This is an order at the counter type of place so it's not fancy but the food is fast and good.  I've looked around wherever I've lived for a greek place I like as well, but so far have been unsuccessful.    I mostly get the gyro platter which is great.  It comes with greek salad and those wide yellowish french fries that seem to be common to greek places.  I'm not a fan of the fries myself so I always order it with no fries and extra salad.  It only comes with half a pita bread though, so If you like to put the meat and salad together in the pita to eat (like I do) I suggest you invest less than a buck in an extra order of pita bread.  We also like the stuffed grape leaves if you are in the mood for an appetizer, but the gyro platter is usually big enough without anything else.",

    "text": "I'm a little surprised by all the negative reviews. I've been coming here since I was a kid so there may be a little bit of nostalgia coloring my view but the food here really is quite good for the price.  This is fast food type Greek so it's definitely not fancy but it's reasonably priced and tasty. Anything with chicken in it is a good bet here. It's tender and very flavorful as a result of being marinated in Greek spices. Akropolis also has some of the best Greek dressing I've ever had. I pretty much put it in everything. It's excellent on the French fries and on the Greek rice in addition to the salad. I'm a big fan of their spanakopita because it's served in very small little triangles and has the perfect filling to dough ratio. I'm not a fan of big slices of spanikopita because there's too much spinach and too little crunch from the phyllo dough.  I'll readily admit Akropolis doesn't have the best service. The staff here is always made up of really young high school kids and a lot of them fool around behind the counter instead of getting the food out promptly. This can be kind of annoying but realistically, you usually can't expect excellent customer service at a quick service restaurant and since I'm never paying a lot here, I can deal with a few instances of fifteen year olds slacking off.   This may not be a must visit spot in Charlotte but it's a great spot to stop for a quick, casual meal while shopping at the Arboretum.",

My mother and I went to this restaurant for lunch, and everything was horrible. The lettuce was covered in a very watery dressing and was sitting in a puddle of water on the plate! The tenderloin skewers tasted like they had been pulled out of the fridge and microwaved. There were entirely too many fries on the plate, and they were pretty dry. The bread was not fresh, the meat was dry, and the tzatziki sauce was more like mayonnaise. My mother, who had the sweet tea, said that is kind of tastes like they used instant tea. She said she didn't know that you could mess up sweet tea, but they did. It's an insult to Greek food. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself was dirty and not at all fresh, like a cafe should be. It felt more like McDonalds. Please, any place is better than here.",

The cashier who took my order payed more attention to the customer, a guy behind me, than I. I ordered the chicken kebab dinner, with fries, a Greek salad, and pita bread for $7.99, not a bad price. However, I waited over 20 minutes for my food and not be given a #, the servers just walk around and see who it belongs to. So, the chicken was seasoned great, and I enjoyed the sauce and pita bread, but the Greek salad was bland and the fries cold and not cooked or hard a rock. Not the best Greek in my mind.",

    "text": "This place is a joke. Poorly run and mediocre food. Called in an order for takeout - a whole 2 items and they forgot to include one meal when we came to pick it up! Plus we ordered from the online menu and I tried to order a couple things that she said weren't available. Then as I was asking the girl about the combo platter (probably my 3rd question) she told me the menu online isn't up to date. One, wouldn't you tell me that up front? Two, why wouldn't they pay someone a hundred bucks to update the website?! So inconvenient for both sides.  Now the food - aside from the order being wrong, when we got home (only 3 minutes away) the pork was so dry it was hard to chew. The grilled chicken had way too much garlic in it and the pita was soggy and flavorless. They offered a to-go menu on our way out but we didn't take it. We'll never be back.",

    "text": "Went here a number of times when visiting family in the area.  At that time there was table service for the wide variety of Greek dishes.  Wife and I went in on a Saturday for a late lunch.  Not crowded at all.  And it appeared to us that they had expanded the interior, put in more tables and also did away with table service.  You order from a pretty large menu on the wall above the kitchen.  The person at the cash register takes your order, you pay and the food is brought to your table.    We just wanted gyros and ended up having gyro platters, which were cheaper than the sandwich and a drink.  So we got good french fries, tea and a nice fat gyro wrapped in aluminum foil with tzatziki sauce.  Pretty disappointing for both of us.  As mentioned, fries were good, but the gyro was pretty blah.  They emphasize that they serve beef gyros and I think that is why they lacked flavor.  Also, the pita bread was flavorless and a bit tough.    If you want more tzatziki sauce it is $.99.    This could have been a two-star, but it is convenient in the Arboretum Shopping center and you can get a reasonable lunch that would satisfy most people.  We have just had better gyro meats, so will go to other places in lieu of coming back here.",

I have been there countless times and have never witnessed the slightest inkling of organization.  A really pathetic customer service experience.

The Tzaatziki sauce is creamy and flavorful - just the consistency I like - unfortunately, if you want more, it'll cost you. The chicken souvlaki is fairly moist and flavorful. The fries are surprisingly crisp for the size. I would definitely recommend this locale if your in the mood for a little greek.",

    "text": "A friend and I got together to catch up for lunch and looked around and decided to try Akropolis. The price of the food was affordable and they had a decent menu to choose from. Unfortunately we experienced very very poor service at our visit today. The man who took our order was very nice and patient with us, since it was our first time and was the only person to really check up on us during our time there. After we ordered our food we waited a long time for our food to arrive to our table. A few moments later one of the servers approached us with an order and announced it as the #9 meal which is what my friend ordered. Five to ten minutes goes by and a food runner drops off a plate of hummus and pita bread. The server dropped it off at our table and maybe mumbled some words then walked away. I wasn't 100% paying attention to them them so I we just started eating the food. Like I mentioned my friend and I have never been here and we honestly just assumed it came with the food we were confused as to why we got it but we just went with it. We understand that we probably should have asked and that was our mistake on our part but like I said we didn't know. A few minutes pass and another server comes by and says she has a #9 ...... my friend already had food in front of her so I simply asked \"Do you mean a number 10 because that's what I ordered.\" The server was rather rude and didn't respond in a nice way at all, all she did was just repeat what she had in her hands. So I took the plate from her and she walked away. No apology, no sympathy or anything, just poor customer service skills. Turns out the first server who approached our table gave my order to my friend but called it the wrong thing. Our meals looked completely different so I am confused as to how she got them mixed up. Then during our meal I assume the manager comes up to us and asks to see our receipts. This was when we found out the hummus and pita didn't come with our meal, she said \"You didn't order the hummus, who gave you this food?\" I personally do not remember who dropped off our food because we had THREE different servers approach us and like mentioned whoever dropped it off kind of quickly dropped it off then walked away. My friend and I told her that we don't remember who dropped it off and the manager started raising her voice and catching an attitude saying \"I know you know exactly who gave it to you and I need you to tell me who dropped this off.\" I already told her the first time I was not sure and this happened 30 minutes ago. I was not fond of the manager talking down to us as if we were pesky teenagers trying to mess with her. She then continues to yell at the employees from our table and got even more angrier when no one would speak up. Very unprofessional to see. We were checked up on once but the man who took our order and he offered us refills but that was the only time we were really ever checked up on. For the most part the food was mediocre but the service really put me off and won't see myself coming back here again due to the poor service and the lack of care for their customers. I am a server at a restaurant myself and I will always give other servers some wiggle room when things don't go as planned but from the look of this establishment, it is very poorly ran and unorganized.",

I have been a loyal customer for 18 long years and have loved your food over that time.  I always order ahead from work and come in to pick up and bring back to the office (about 15 min away).  You all know my name when I call to place an order and say hello with my name when I pick up BUT today was a final straw because of your management's lack of customer service. I ordered by phone as usual and you took my phone number too (as always).  I arrived at your restaurant to pick up my food and you told me then that it was cash only as the internet was down and you could not accept credit card payment.  I did not have cash but offered to pay via check (again you all know me - I am in every week for 18 years now).  The ATM for my bank is back by my office 15 minutes away and I had a work conference call to get back to so didn't have time to make the trip to the bank.  You also advised me that you learned the Internet and CC machine were down right after I called in my order.  SO, you could have called me back since you have my phone number to let me know I needed cash to pay.  I was cordial in my feedback to you today and even asked if I could come back and pay later but your manager would not allow.  Very sad that a long time customer was not informed of your issue with Internet yet couldn't pick up a food order when you very likely then had to throw away my order!  What a waste and now you have lost a client for good.  Stay FAR away from this establishment.  I am done now.....",

At about 9:36 the suppose to be \"supervisor\" started to put up chairs on the tables around us.  When I asked if I could get a slice of baklava the \"supervisor\" was very rude yelling at the guy in the kitchen (who was not Greek by the way) for putting the baklava on a plate instead of in a to go box.  He yelled to him that they were closed even though it was 20 minutes before 10:00.  The girl at the counter was very nice and asked if I wanted it to go.  After hearing the commotion I said that was fine.  Our experience tonight definitely made me long to dine at some of the other Greek restaurants in the area that we were used to.

    "text": "Ever since Clucker's in McMullen Creek closed, I've been on the hunt for a new go-to place for Greek food.  This was my first trip to Akropolis Cafe along with 3 other people. I ordered the #13 Chicken Souvlaki Shishkabob, Greek Salad, Fries & Pita Bread.  The food was good but not fantastic.  It was a good lunch.  For that alone I would gladly give at least 3 stars.  But the tipping point was the horrible lack of service.  When the food was delivered to the table, they forgot the utensils.  I had to literally track someone down, get their attention as ask for knives and forks for the table.  The failure of attention to small details coupled with having hot food sitting in front of you and being unable to eat it is a frustrating experience.  I must say I was a bit put-off by the little sign by the register stating additional tzatziki would cost extra.  Maybe because what they give you to start with is so small, that an extra side is almost required.  Recap: decent food, poor service.  Sigh...the hunt continues....",
