    "text": "Love Moe's in general! Their food is always delicious! This particular location always gets my food correct and it always tastes great! The service isn't the best though. Most of the employees look as if it was a drag to come in to work and like its killing them to be there. I dont know if morale is down among the staff or what, but it definitely projects towards the customer. The poor morale is made up for by the cool coke machine and the cute outdoor seating area. Moe's in Dilworth is the closest to my job and is about 15 minutes away, but I make the trek a couple times a month for lunch. I can overlook bad vibes as long as they get my order correct and in a timely manner and I'm satisfied with my food at the end of the day.",

Also my hard taco fell apart in a minute cause their steak made it too soggy. They do have 5-6 free salsas, and the touch screen soda fountain. Their queso doesn't taste like real cheese to me, but it's alright! I like Chipotle better, but Ill be back here if convenient!",

    "text": "I'm only giving it 5 stars because I'm in love with the food...shh don't tell.  Any who the personality and politeness of the staff could use some work.  I normally go to this one because sometimes it's just easier.  I've never had issues with the staff and the way they have treated me in the past.  So things have been good, I went to this Moe's on Saturday and it was bone dry no one there until I parked then it got crowded.  I went in and they did their normal annoying welcome to moes.  No big deal it's their thing.  Any who I ordered my food, I felt rushed so that was strike 1.  Once I ordered my food the guy who was actually fixing it act as if he was scared to give me the toppings I asked for.  Strike 2, then the manager I guess actually checked me out I asked for a bag to put my stuff in because I did order food for more than just my self.  Well he gave me the bag, I looked at him and thought WOW.  At that point I felt like I was at the self check out in a grocery store.  I can honestly say that this has never happened to me before, what happened to great customer service? I guess something simple as putting a customers food in a bag is too much work.  I was very upset by this, but I said ok no big I know how to put my stuff in a bag even though it was his job.  The high light of the visit besides how good the food is was the soda machine.  I must say that I'm not a coke fan but will drink a sprite with the best of them when I'm forced.  But this machine was amazing.  I was plesantly surprised about the choices this machine gave.  Like I said I'm not a coke fan, but I stood there for several minutes looking at the choices I had of sprite.  I was impressed by this and the food.  The employees attitudes suck really bad, they need a reality check. If the public is not something you want to deal with on a daily bases, then let me suggest getting a office gig some where.",

Moe's is on par with Salsarita's, Chipotle, and Qdoba.  Its not-quite-fast-food-Mexican that tastes fresh.  Of all these chains, I give Moe's the highest rating for freshly seasoned meats. My fav is the quesadilla-they use fresh cheese, yo!  And unlike other chains, they treat you like a big kid and let you serve yourself unlimited salsas.    Note: The Kaiser is a little sweet and not so spicy, the tomatillo es muy picante!    The staff are pretty friendly. I told one of front line staff that they needed some plastic knives and the cook came out with a huge butcher knife and asked if I wanted to borrow his. Mu ha haaa!!!  Service around closing can be haphazard, they pretty much close up shop as you're eating.  Otherwise, this might be a good place to start an evening on the Dilworth bar/restaurant/entertainment circuit.",

At first my training buddy and I frequented it for the large, and relatively healthy, chicken burritos...(the Joey Bag O Donuts.)  They also have a salsa bar with some really good options including one called \"Who Is Kaiser Salsa?\" (See \"The Usual Suspects\" for reference.) The friendly atmosphere (Welcome to Moe's!) and dead-musician theme and made it a unique favorite.  This Moe's has become a neighborhood institution as shown by the outpouring of sympathy and support in the aftermath of the tragedy a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, the service and quality have also slipped over the years.  Nowadays you don't always get a welcome shout and the staff just don't seem to be as focused on the customers as they used to be.  In fact, they seem to spend a lot of time shouting at full volume to each other.  However, it's still a good lunch at a good price in the heart of Dilworth.",

Anywho, this is a pretty standard Moe's but it's baller status in my book because they have an outdoor patio on the side. Plus they give you free chips and have a variety of salsa to try. They even have one named the El Guapo and any salsa named after a character in Three Amigos rocks my world.

It's gone from mediocre, to downright disrespectful. I won't go on too much of a rant. I'll simply state a few suggestions for their \"training dept/HR department\"(if there is one). 1-don't answer your cell phone in front of any customer 2-don't have piles of dirty dishes beside my burrito bowl, that you're currently preparing 3-don't scream \"not my job\", multiple times. I'm sure everyone heard the 3 workers, across the street at Babalu. 4-do promote or commend the guy who came from the back of the restaurant, to assist me. 5-don't say \"you're done\", in a very obvious dismissive tone, after the completion of my transaction. Maybe a phrase like \"have a nice day\", \"can I get you anything else\". PS: the entire staff were surely over 35. Which isn't old.

The parking lot is always full, Mexican sounds good, so my car led me to Moe's. I was greeted as I walked in by an enthusiastic staff. After looking over the menu I decided to go with two tacos. I ordered one chicken soft taco and one ground beef taco in a hard shell. I chose my fixings, added chips and queso and headed home. The ground beef was very flavorful, however not something you should take to go. The side the ground beef was on made the hard shell completely soft and I was unable to pick it up. No big deal because it was the best thing I ate. As for the chicken, very dry! And, the chips were fresh, but cold and no seasoning or salt. As for the queso, I wouldn't waste my money, nothing but melted cheese. I like a little kick, seasoning, jalepenos, etc. Overall the staff was friendly and the meal okay. Not my favorite Mexican fast food, but I would return and dine in next time.",

I don't know if the unlimited chips and salsa is a new thing or not, but I was not expecting any chips in my bag at all when I stopped int to get my burrito.  It was a nice surprise - but they probably make up for the chips by selling queso.  I have been to this location in the summer and had the opportunity to eat outside in the patio area (in the back/side of the building).  It would have been great but the only thing I remember was a pungent smell.  We thought the trash just hadn't been changed out in a while, but when we were leaving we noticed the grease dumpster right outside the patio area...... DOH.  Even though our noses were not happy...we still managed to eat (which does say a lot about the food I guess).",

Actually I think you have better choices at Moe's than at Qdoba, Salsaritas, and Chipotle.  You can customize your meal in 370 different combinations.   I usually get the closetalker salad with chicken, black beans, pico, cilantro, cheese, cucumbers, and instead of the their dressings iI use the salsas from their salsa bar.  I also like fact that they use shredded lettuce in the salad.  They experimented with romaine one time but I didn't like that as much.  At Moe's you always feel welcome because you are always greeted when you walk in the door.  \"Welcome to Moe's\".",

I was asked 3 times..... Queso on your chips???.....Queso on your chips???...I couldn't  figure  who he was addressing so I finally said no. Meantime as my son was ordering  he was asked about toppings and he said guacamole. ...immediately  invoking the ....these are Homewreckers shout out ...as if he was trying to pull a fast one. So as I payed Iaded two drinks  since the kids meal had a drink. They get their drinks and I realized  they  had charged for 4 drinks so I go back with a cup and asked for a refund. That's when the Manager tells me that I was charged correctly but he would  refund anyway. Being that had also tipped on the order I was caught off guard.  Just bad attitude and service....... Twilight  Zone .....and I did call and gave Him my opinion and filled out their survey online",

    "text": "This was the only place open when I arrived in Charlotte late that night.  I was thankful just to find something after walking around the area for a while since I wasn't given a car...   The experience is similar to a Chipolte, if you're not from the area. They did have tofu and other options you don't normally see in chain of this nature. The food was ok. I was amused by the fact they had Southern (sweet) tea and Northern (non-sweetened) tea. I guess the war between north and south continues!   They gave me a huge bag of chips with my meal.  It may have been because they were closing but I never did finish it all off. In fact, I think most of them ended up being thrown out.   Overall, if you're looking for something that can be relatively healthy and vegetarian and nothing else is open, check this place out.",

You order over the counter and follow your food down the \"assembly line\" as they build and top it for you.   I usually get the Tofu Close Talker salad sans fried shell. They have fresh toppings such as marinated mushrooms, jalepenos, grilled onions and peppers, and black olives. They have daily deals and the prices are great.   There is a self-serve salsa bar with about six different salsas. The line can get long during peak lunch and dinner times and especially on kids' night. The cleanliness of the place is a hit-or-miss because the tables can get pretty dirty.  All-in-all its an awesome place to grab a quick bite. Everyone in the neighborhood seems to be a regular here and the staff remembers you after you've gone a couple times which makes it intimate.",

    "text": "I visit this Moe's in Dilworth occasionally for lunch on Saturdays.  I think the burritos taste a bit better at Qdoba and Chipotle, but Moe's offers something the others don't:  free chips and a salsa bar with a variety of yummy salsas (including my fave, the sweet green tomatillo salsa; I could literally eat buckets of it).    I hate the whole \"Welcome to Moe's!\" thing when I go into a Moe's.  It's very insincere sounding and just sounds so unenthusiastic/routine.  Nobody even looks up to smile and greet you.  They just listen for someone to come in the door and shout.  I'd have nightmares about it if I worked there.    Anyway, the service there always seems a bit off whenever I go.  It takes awhile for someone to greet you because they're busy doing whatever side work they're doing and/or talking amongst themselves.    This last time around, I tried the vegetarian burrito.  It comes with \"free\" guacamole whereas you have to pay to get it on the meat-filled burritos.  It seems kind of silly to ask me what I want on my burrito, but they do.  I want everything that's listed on the menu, that's what I want.  Maybe they're hoping I don't ask for the more-expensive guac even though it says it comes with it?    The male manager who works there and operates the cash register is usually quite rude, abrupt, and doesn't care whether you're there or not.  And, most times, he's watching a sports game on one of the TVs in the dining room instead of doing his job.  He's your stereotypical store/restaurant manager.  This time, he took time out from frying up nacho chips (a daunting task, I'm sure) to briefly ring me up and sliding my food to me across the counter, before returning to his other task.  Well, thank you, and you have a nice day, too.  For that, you want me to fill up your tip jar prominently located at the register?  Methinks not.  The burrito seemed a bit small without the meat.  Qdoba and Chipotle seem to give you more rice and beans.  Maybe this would be a good idea for Moe's, too, especially on vegetarian burritos?  It tasted pretty good, though, but the guac could have been a bit fresher and brighter green.  And, naturally, the chips and unlimited tomatillo salsa were fantastic.  They even have a new salsa: a mixture of a tomato salsa and tomatillo.  It was good, too, but I still preferred the green tomatillo.    I give the burrito a solid B, the chips and salsa bar an A++, and the service a C.  Hence, my four stars.",

It's the Moe's standard you'd expect, with the exception of the chips. Maybe this was a fluke day, but mine were definitely on the stale side. Thank goodness they were sparse with the chips today. But the chicken was tasty, well cooked and the salsas were fresh.   The downfall truly was the ordering process. Everything was slopped down in my bowl with the same enthuasium as a disgruntled elementary cafeteria lady.   I will say, on the bright side, the cashier was friendly. I believe his name was Lyron.",

Call it overkill from eating it throughout college or what but I usually whine a bit when this is where my parents want to go to eat with me. I usually find everything bland. But I had a gift card soooo today was the day to use it.  I opted for something I don't normally get since I have been displeased with my previous pickings...a quesadilla. More specifically one with steak (grass fed here which is a nice touch), pintos, mushrooms, grilled onions & peppers, cilantro and jalapenos. Then we also scored ourselves a cup of chili con queso, a limited time item. The quesadilla was just alright, the steak was surprisingly flavorful this time but the mushrooms had a very strange flavor to them..no bueno. The guy assumed I meant pickled jalapenos when I requested \"jalapenos\" , but I meant the fresh ones so I ended up picking the pickled ones off. The chili con carne was really good though. They should consider making this a regular item, way more interesting than the regular ol' queso. Dipping the quesadilla in it was not the worst idea either.  It was pretty empty when we went in, an odd middle of lunch and dinner time and the 2 people working there were very friendly and helpful. They did have great tunes playing the whole time as well. It wasn't as terrible as I remember but still not enough to make me crave anything from Moe's or go back, unless I have another gift card.",

I counted 5 employees. 1 was chatting up a table, 2 went to find whole wheat tortillas and one told the other one to come help the person in front of me.",

    "text": "Used Moes catering for an event for our managers. The order was for a taco bar, with fiesta bar and extra queso for a total of 18 people. The amount of food we received was embarrassing and I didn't receive the extras I paid for. Only 10 people was able to eat and I had to make a quick fast food run. I was so embarrassed that I used this company. The offered me a 20% discount on my next order as restitution.  Are you kidding?  Stay far far away from this place!",
