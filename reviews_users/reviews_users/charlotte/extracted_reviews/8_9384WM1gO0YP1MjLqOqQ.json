Hearing about the greatest sandwich since the Earl himself invented it, I had to try it.  And it was good.  No where near mind-blowing however, and certainly not the best sandwich available in uptown.  The Pho is also pretty good.  The broth (which is the hallmark of Pho) is delicious - worthy of picking up your bowl and crushing it like a college freshman in a beer chugging contest.  The chicken for the Pho, however was blah, tasteless, and dissapointing.  Overall though, good dish, I'd recommend.  The thing they really have going for them is first, they're miles above that dreadful Chinese place that occupied the space previously, and second, they offer good value.  That pork sandwich?  less than $5 and certainly enough food by itself for a healthy appetite.  The Pho?  ~$7 which is a good value given the quality and quantity.  Certainly worth checking it out, but I wouldn't make a special trip.",

The shrimp summer rolls are a pretty tasty appetizer, but it's a lot so I'd suggest sharing it (it's two large sized rollers per order). I've had the chicken pho, vegetarian pho, and shrimp fried rice; they were all pretty tasty but I think the chicken pho is my favorite. The broth is very flavorful in both soups, but the tofu that came in the vegetarian was a little too soft for me. The broth is tasty enough that I could eat it by itself, and when I do takeout I sometimes do just that. All in all, this is a great little lunch spot that I'd recommend to anyone - especially on a chilly day!",

I was hungry so I decided to splurge or pig out - whatever you prefer. I got a \"small\" pho with chicken and the pork sandwich. First of all I got it to go and I wouldn't say that was a mistake just makes it a little harder to eat the pho. They did a great job however of packaging everything so that I could eat at my desk.  First off the sandwich was huge and only like $4.50. They could sell them for $6.95 easily. The bread was perhaps the best I've had in Charlotte - think Amalie's style baguette - but better. Yes I'm serious. I mean this was like small village restaurant in France good. Now the pork - wow. Thin sliced ham - again similar to what you might get in France. And then it has other interesting ingredients packed in like thin sliced jalapenos. Super tasty and what a deal.   So now I have this huge container of soup to deal with. Not a problem. Noodles were perfect and chicken was tasty. Added a little sriracha sauce and it was perfect. One other review said the broth seemed slightly sweet and I detected that as well but it wasn't overwhelming and I thought it added to the flavor.   So if you are looking for something a little different for lunch give them a shot. They also have a decent dining area so feel fee to eat in as well.",

So I did and loved it even though she ate all of the basil that they brought to our table. I always get the chicken Pho or Summer rolls which are amazing. I have also tried some of the other dishes (vermicelli plates, sandwiches) and everything is good. I just love the Pho!! They do mess up your order from time to time so if you are grabbing take-out make sure to check before you leave!!",

    "text": "While on a business trip to Charlotte during one of the coldest days in North Carolina history, I had a craving for warm soup and found this restaurant nearby my hotel.  It's a casual place where you order at the counter and can choose to sit down or do takeout.  I had the shrimp/chicken summer rolls with peanut dipping sauce and the Pho Ga (chicken pho).    The summer roll was solid and came with a good amount of chicken and shrimp inside.  The cellophane wrapper was the perfect crispness without being overly soggy.    The chicken pho (small portion) was very large and came with plenty of noodles, chicken, and onions.  The broth was flavorful, though I'm fairly certain that it had a healthy amount of MSG in it because after the meal I had a severe food coma and had to lie down for a nap.  On the whole, the meal was very satisfying and just perfect for a cold winter day.    The service was pleasant and extremely attentive - my water was constantly refilled and I was asked multiple times if I needed anything.    If you find yourself with a craving for Vietnamese food give this place a try!  One other thing:  apparently they outsource a delivery service so you don't need to pick-up or dine-in.",

The pho is authentic, portion smaller than what you get in California, if you used to get regular size bowl, you may have to ask for large size, and if you start with large at home, you may need to add extra noodle. If you go to Colorado, it is a different thing, their medium is large in California. Less exotic ingredients that were standard in Little Saigon, here is simple beef slice and beef balls. The bean sprouts and herbs are washed very clean, extra point. Soup base is tasty and well done, slightly salty. Egg roll is up to par, Vietnamese coffee is made from the condensed version you can get at Costco, which is okay consider the location. Very clean restaurant and nice service.",

The portions are quite large compared to most places uptown, so price/quantity ratio it is a good deal. Not really having a baseline for Vietnamese food, I enjoyed it. It was healthy and filled me up. The Pho was definitely more flavorful than the vermicelli but both were satisfying. For sure a good lunch option!",

    "text": "Came in here for lunch and was very disappointed with my meal. Before I go on, I want to let everyone know that the PHO here is very good! Guess that's why they call it PHO Plus, huh? You get a great bowl of Pho and a good amount of it making for a great value.  It's everything else that's the problem. Take a look at my related picture. Iceburg lettuce, a couple small slices of cucumber and tomato, and ONE TEENY TINY skewer of.....oh, what is that, beef? Really? That was literally ONE BITE of beef! Was it good? Yupper. The chicken had that semi-sweet weird color sauce but it really was equally good. But there were 2 very thin pieces of chicken here, over a handful of (semi-fried) rice. For $9.00! Most Asian places would give you a LOT more for your money.  Here's a few other quirks that I can't stand. One. NO KNIVES at the table! So, guess you'll have to shred your egg rolls, chicken, pork and beef with your forks. Waiters are tough to come by at lunch.  The one thing that I REALLY can't stand is that YOU HAVE TO QUEUE BACK INTO THE ORDER LINE TO PAY YOUR BILL!!!!! Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?$#@!*& WHY do I have to stand in an ORDERING line to pay my bill? I'll tell you why. The old Asian guy who must be the owner most likely doesn't trust his servers with money and he is the ONLY guy who handles payment. When there is nobody in the restaurant, this is not a problem. However, at lunch time when it IS busy, I don't want to have to wait in an ORDER line to pay my bill! It took me like 15+ minutes to pay my bill. That is UNACCEPTABLE! This practice gets MINUS 100 STARS! STUPIDO!  Bottom line: 1) Only order the Pho. 2) Go during a non-busy time so that you don't have to wait through the order line to pay your bill.",

The prices are reasonable, the service is quick, and the food is always delicious.  My go-to is the chicken pho. They use breast meet sliced thin, and it's perfect every time. The broth is very flavorful and the noodles are plentiful. I've also had the beef pho and the combination pho; they're all winners. When it's too hot outside for me to properly enjoy a steaming bowl of pho, I go with the chargrilled pork bun. I can't speak to any of the juices or teas they serve; I've been at least a dozen times and I've never seen anyone order something from the bar downstairs.  Speaking of, the upstairs and downstairs feel like two separate restaurants, but that's not a bad thing. The upstairs is great for a lunch with coworkers; they'll move tables together for you and you'll have a great meal near the bright windows. But if you're on a lunch date, the booths on the ground floor are just private enough for you to make eyes at your partner. Best of both worlds.  My biggest complaint about Pho Plus has nothing to do with the food, but the restroom. The door has a doorknob instead of a handle, so after I've washed my hands I have to wrap my fingers around the doorknob to leave, and I always feel like I've undone anything hygienic I had achieved. Though, really, it's a small price to pay.",

I had expected a lesser quality broth given that they are primarily a quick lunch crowd; like who's going to notice, right?  But I was more than satisfied with the taste of both dishes.

He's so welcoming and friendly to everyone who steps foot in the door. It's a very authentic mom and pop restaurant & you should give it a shot!",

If he was not nice I will give a 1 star. The foods are just not good.   Portions are extremely small !!!!!",

The closest that Pho+ has to this is rare steak/meatball/brisket. As far as the food itself: Broth - unbelievable Noodles, accoutrements (bean sprouts, herbs, jalapenos, lime) - excellent Other - person I was eating with got a piece of a plastic wrapper in his food.   Was good enough that he just took it out and finished his meal, but worth noting.  The service was somewhat lacking - when I walked it, there were zero people there.  I guess they were back in the kitchen, but I even tried calling out to no avail.  Was finally seated afyter about 10-15 minutes when someone finally strolled out of the back.  This was at 6:45PM on a Wednesday.  After that the service fine.  If not for the plastic wrapper and initial service situation, would definitely be a 5*.  The pho is very, very good.",

The broth itself was so good the rest almost didn't matter, but it does so I will add that the noodles, chicken and flavoring were on point. They have two sizes, medium and large and the medium is plenty! Unless your a super eater like my bf who got the large (see photo) and finished it. I ordeeedbthe chicken pho and he ordered the mixed meat.  We also ordered the summer rolls which were good, but had a lot of mint and basil (which they are supposed to) but if you aren't used to Thai cuisine it can be a bit much. The peanut sauce was perfect tho and everything was delicious. We'll definitely be back and I reccomend to anyone!",

I need this to be as wonderful as my first trip.   I've only dined in during the 2nd visit and service was fine.  The to go order taker did clarify and correct me over the phone the $6 small no longer existed. I prefer brisket over all other meat options.  They always include the brown and re sauces but skipped my limes on the 3rd visit.   Based on the cost; and they are the only real Pho option Uptown, I will make it my business to find other options in NODA and get back to Saigon Palace when given options.

Broth was packaged in a separate container so everything stayed fresh and crisp.

It's located behind the Latta Arcade in Brevard Court so already a win-win location.  There is so much history in the buildings and a very cool part of Uptown to be in.  I first tried this place on a rainy-cold day and the P1 combination did not disappoint.  I've been back a couple times and have tried their appetizers... spring rolls are pretty awesome, but the summer rolls are too if you are looking for a refreshing, non-fried alternative.  Their sandwiches are definitely tasty and fairly priced for the yumminess that you get.  You can't really beat a huge bowl of pho tho... I just love using the spoon in my left hand and chopsticks in my right hand and attacking a great tasting dish for lunch.  This place recently added booths! They used to just have all round tables, but I think the booths they built are nice and provide a bit of privacy with high backs if you are having a lunch date... or like me, reading my kindle by myself :(...  Highly recommend the Vietnamese Iced Latte if you are a coffee drinker... watch out if you aren't a sweets person though.  It's a nice treat or after meal/during drink.",

This is also an all-around good meal when you've eaten too many servings of pizza over the weekend and want something light to eat. I love that you are able to customize the pho a bit, I always get the chicken one and add broccoli to get my veggies in and I ask for no cilantro 'cause I'm one of those people who think it tastes like soap! For around $10 bucks, this a good deal in Uptown Charlotte - especially if you save your leftovers in the little soup plastic container they give you. The only reason I docked them a star is because I'm 1000% sure that the broccoli is frozen broccoli that they defrost before putting in the soup, its definitely not fresh but I mean the pho is all about the broth right? :)",

I could just as easily buy my drinks at the counter and bus my own table.  I'm not going to tell you its amazing, because it isn't.  At $6.75 a small bowl and $8.50 a large bowl though, who cares.  I'm not sure if there is a better deal downtown.  The small should be plenty enough for most people's lunch.  Of course I had to go big though.  All the basic accoutrements, fresh basil, extremely crispy bean sprouts, and some sliced jalapeno came out quickly.  Something to snack on while you wait I guess.  It only took 5 minutes for the pho though.  I liked it more than Pho Real, but not quite up there with Ben Thahn, Vietnam Grille, and the like.  It just didn't have quite the depth of flavor.  That said, no complaints on the food.  I did spend some time without water and they weren't even very busy.  Bottom line is, I will tell every living soul that I know downtown about this place while its cold out.  People need to know.",

Since there are various infractions that impact sanitation score I decided to research what Pho Plus' were before completing this review. There were 6 critical violations that have seen some improvement since the 12/28/16 inspection. Based on an issue with the ice maker, my suggestion for your visit would be to order a canned or bottled drink.   Now for the good news. The service was quick during the lunchtime rush. The food came out quickly. We ordered spring rolls, chicken pho, and seafood pho. The spring rolls were crispy and not at all greasy. There was lots of sprouts, basil, and jalapenos provided on the side to adjust your dish as needed. The warm, flavorful broth was exactly what we needed on such a cold day. My first visit was a to-go order and the quality matched my sit-down experience today.   I would return and potentially try some other menu items but hopefully after a successful updated inspection. The sanitation grade is the reason I gave 3 stars as opposed to 4.",

A few weaknesses which I think could see some improvement are not related to their great food. I'd prefer no TV's in the dining room, a wider selection of tea, and a few more choices of sauces to accompany the food.  I like this place and hope they make it  Good food, great value, friendly staff.",

The pho is also good- not the best I've had but definitely still a great option. The menu is simple but all you need for a lunch place and the service is fast.   The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the health rating isn't very good which is a little scary. I also think there are some better quality Vietnamese restaurants in charlotte but this is still a fantastic lunch option uptown. Most of the good places are super far out so pho plus definitely gets points for convenience.",

Nothing beats a great bowl of pho when it's cold or I'm not feeling well, bahn mi is one of my favorite sandwiches, and a bun (rice noodles with veggies, meat and fish sauce) with shrimp can really make my day.    As far as I know, Pho Plus is the only vietnamese restaurant uptown - so, I go there occasionally for lunch.  Their pho is adequate, but I think the broth is a little bland.  The bahn mi is also fine, but can be a bit dry and lacking flavor.  The bun - the same, just average.   The decor - well, similar to the food, pretty unremarkable.    That being said, l go there to get my vietnamese fix in the middle of the day. You can stand in line and get take out or sit at the tables to dine in.",

One interrupted my meal twice to replenish condiments but not ask if I wanted more water or if I needed anything else. One server told me they do not serve tea and another server had no problem bringing me a cup of tea. Huh?  The meatballs in the Pho Beef were cold in the middle. In addition, the bread for the sandwiches is different from when I first ate there a few weeks ago. It's no longer a crusty baguette that is soft inside...it's now a very soft loaf. It's not bad. Just different.  Once the lunch rush arrived I was forgotten and had to take my leftovers to the cashier to provide me with a container.   Service here is always different based on the server working that day. This may be an issue for groups who are looking for quick efficient service during their short lunch break. You might find yourself frustrated.  Overall, the food is good and very affordable. It's best to carryout if you plan to go between 11:30a - 1p. Don't say I didn't warn you.",

Given the choice between burgers, pizza baked goods or Vietnamese, it wasn't a tough decision.  I snagged a spot by the window and ordered quickly. While I normally am a sucker for a bowl of Pho, I've been craving the perfect little Bahn Mi sandwich for a while now and couldn't pass it up!   I always forget that these little sandwiches are such a filling meal! I ordered chicken, which was perfectly marinated. Fresh cucumber and crispy bread make a perfect combo!

We got our food more quickly than our friends did at the pizza place nearby.  For the food. They have bahn mi, pho and other Vietamese dishes. I ordered the pork bahn mi and some summer rolls. The bahn mi was huge. The pork had a good flavor,  but wasn't as tender as I would like it to be. I liked the vegetables, but wish the sandwich had more. The bun was spot on to hold all the flavors in. It was refreshing for a hot day. The summer rolls were good. By themselves, they were a little bland, but the peanut sauce was great. I'd like to try the pho, but maybe not on a day when it's 90 degrees. The meal did fill me up the rest of the day.  All in all, It's a great value and I'll keep it on my list of lunch options.",

But when I finally got it, I slurped it down so fast. I was craving some bubble tea as it was super hot outside and I was sweaty from walking around outside. It tasted really good.

Place has kinda of a Blade Runner feel to it except without the gloom, the rain, the flying cars, the neon, and it isn't post-global-environment-event Los Angeles. Like every pho place I've been to the sizes are medium and large - apparently no Vietnamese word translates to 'small'. Order from the big board behind the cashier and the soup will find you at one of the tables or the counter facing out the front window.  A delicious noodley soup that delivers everything that the AHCA promised: strong clear broth, substantial pieces of beef and balled meats, greens (herbs, pepper, citrus), and plenty of spicy warm goodness that will cure whatever ails you. Soy-, Hoisin-, and sriracha sauce are on the table as are salt, pepper, other pepper paste in oil, and chop sticks.

I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much, since I grew up with tons of Vietnamese people and grew up in an area where good, authentic Vietnamese food was abundant.  So, after eating at Pho Plus, I can confidently say that they serve up some fairly authentic tasting pho with a decent broth that is comparable to Vietnamese food in the Atlanta suburbs (Buford Hwy, anyone?).     I would skip the appetizers.  The spring rolls (cha gio) were mediocre and the summer rolls (goi cuon) were less than mediocre.  Very skinny rolls with little filling and the outer rice sheet was too firm.  I have not had the banh mi here, so I can't comment on that.  As for the pho, I got the rare steak with tripe, as I always get at every single pho restaurant.  I loved that Pho Plus offers up a very delicious and very spicy hot chili oil that goes really well with the soup, if you're looking for some heat.  A little goes a really long way as it was pretty damn spicy for all of us and we eat a lot of spicy food, but it's a good addition to the broth and I don't usually put anything but lime in my broth.  The noodles were cooked nicely and were not soggy, as some bad pho places might have.  The broth was hot, beefy, and spiced the way it should be with the proper Vietnamese herbs.  Proper way to eat pho - add bean sprouts, Thai (Asian) basil, jalapenos (just to make the broth spicier), and a squeeze of lime.  Some people like to throw in Sriracha and hoisin sauce into the broth, but I prefer mixing the two on the side and dipping my meat in it.  I'll be back when I'm craving Vietnamese food!",

    "text": "I must admit, Pho Plus has the best pho broth I've ever had, ever! On top of that, the owner, Vu, is the man! I stopped by for the first time for dinner last week, the bf had it a couple of times before, but he said this was the best experience he's had here. We arrived about an hour before close, there was only one other patron there...I was a little surprised given the good reviews but I'm not complaining, just an observation.  Vu brought us water and seated us right way. We ordered 2 medium chicken pho bowls, I didn't want to chance ordering a large and being stuffed. Surprisingly, our order came out pretty quick and steaming hot. It smelled delicious but tasted even better. I LOVED how fried onions were added to the broth, it made a huge, tasty difference. This was probably the best pho I've ever had. I went to school in Irvine, CA... I've had A LOT of pho in my day. The medium was pretty satisfying, I probably wouldn't get the large ever. We also ordered an almond milk tea with 50/50 black and green tea per Vu's recommendation, it was really good! I was a little nervous of trying milk green tea but it was great.   We will definitely be back for more...hell, I would come back everyday if I could afford it.",

Maybe there's additional seating upstairs.   The pho is decent. Maybe it would've been better if I ate it there since it would've been fresh in the bowl. Not that the to go wasn't fresh. Some things are just meant to be eaten in house. The pho for me is one of them.   Luckily though they gave me a cup for the broth and put the contents in a styrofoam to go box to keep them fresh. I'm giving three stars instead of four or five because I got the seafood pho, which contains crab shrimp and a fishball, but the crab is artificial crab. It's a personal preference. When I have crab I like it to be the real thing. Aside from that after I warmed it up in the microwave because I like my food super hot it was pretty delicious.   The people there were very nice. They also serve a variety of bubble teas and flavored teas. I got a sweet tea on accident, which was more like liquid diabetes. They mixed some unsweet in for me, which is what I should've got. The tea tasted fresh and not over brewed or stale like some places. Overall I would probably come back for times when I need something warm and comfy for chilly southern days.",

Definitely the best Bahn Mi (pork sandwich), it had an amazing, fresh baked, crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside baguette with fresh cilantro, cucumber, jalapeno, daikon radishes, basil, carrots and bean sprouts on top of delicious, marinated, crispy grilled pork slices.  If you've never had Bahn mi before do yourself a favor and come here and order the Pork sandwich, you won't be disappointed.  Plus it is filling but not real heavy so perfect for lunch at work.  The Pho was also very good and the chicken fried rice was amazing.  Can't really say anything bad about this place.  The restaurant itself is really clean and new and the upstairs seating is very spacious.  EAT HERE!!!",

You can tell that the owners are still getting everything figured out but there were no major mishaps.  We had good service for dinner both times when the restaurant was not busy at all.  I would describe the pho broth as being more sweet than I've had at other pho establishments.  I prefer the tangier broth at my favorite pho place on Independence, Pho Huong Que, but it's still good in its own way and you can doctor it up with Sriracha, hoisin, etc.  Protein portions are very generous.

While the Pho and Banh Mi is DECENT the meat content is on the low side.  I wish they would include more meat in the Pho and Banh Mi.  The price is very similar to other Pho and Banh Mi restaurants, but the meat is lacking.  Maybe they rent is higher and they cannot afford to put too much meat in their products.  If that was the case, increase the price a little bit.  Alot of us do not mind a higher price so long as the products are up to par.  So for now, if I want Pho i would go to Doan's Vietnamese restaurant off of South Boulevard.  For Banh Mi, I would go to Le's Sandwiches & Cafe off of North Tryon/Sugar Creek.  When I am downtown and desperate for some Vietnamese food, I would go to Pho Plus.  I hope they would change, as this place has lots of potential!!!",

They were walking around looking lost and confused wondering who ordered what. We asked for our drinks 3 times. Finally my colleague got up and attempted to get her own drink. When we asked for our ticket to leave, the waiter stated she lost our ticket. So I said welp I lost some of the items we ordered. Overall, good food and if I returned it would be a call ahead order to go. Watching the waiters run around so lost, and confused made me not want to sit in there anymore. Once they work out an actual server system (assigned tables/sections) then they may have a better chance.",
