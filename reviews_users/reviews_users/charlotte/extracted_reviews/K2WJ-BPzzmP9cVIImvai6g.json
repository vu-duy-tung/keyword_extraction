    "text": "Cherry Sushi did not impress me at all. The service was horrible. My brother ordered miso soup which he never got. I ordered the tri-color sushi which comes with miso soup and a salad. When my brother's two sushi rolls and my dish arrived, I realized the waitress brought me the wrong dish. She brought me the tri-color sashimi instead of the sushi (nigiri). I had to show her on the menu that these were two different dishes and that the nigiri was supposed to have rice with the fish. Then, I inquired about the miso soup we had ordered (since it should have been out before the main dishes). I got the soup and salad after that, but my brother did not receive his soup. However, after tasting the miso soup, I did not bother asking about his again. The soup was the most watered-down, flavorless miso soup I have ever tried. My brother was done with his dish before my correct dish arrived. On the plus side, the nigiri was pretty good. The sushi rolls were alright. I had also finished my drink before we got any of our food, and my drink was not refilled the entire time. My brother's drink was not either.  Upon getting our check, I saw that we were charged for two miso soups. Since my brother never got his and mine came as part of my meal, I had to ask to get this removed. However, my dish was listed as the tri-color sushi (not the sashimi), so at least that part was right. The pen I was given to sign the receipt with was out of ink. That was no big deal, just the icing on the cake. Overall, horrible service and terrible to good food. The price range was pretty average.",

    "text": "Really hopeful about this place since there is no restaurant nearby  to my home in Springfield.  Was counting on having a \"Baxter type Market Street\" and am definitely disappointed.  The sushi was good and hubby had the Sesame Chicken.  Both quite tasty but a bit expensive.  Server was attentive although the restaurant was not busy on a Monday night. Probably will not return because the buy one get one free sushi deal at Akahana in Baxter is too good to pass up; plus their portions of Sesame Chicken, dumplings, lo mein, etc far exceed Cherry's portion.  And Akahana has a full bar in contrast to Cherry's wine/beer selection.  Maybe adding a full bar along with reasonably priced sushi will be in the future?  And more full service restaurants in Springfield Town Center?  If so count me in!  In the meantime the drive to Baxter will continue to be my preference.",

    "text": "You need to hurry, because this place isn't going to be here much longer. The reasons: 1. Extremely overpriced for what is very mediocre. 2. The menu is confused, not only with concept, also with the sharpe corrections all over it. 3. The food... first we asked about their sushi boat a selection of sushi and nigiri. We were told the chef picks what we get. Ummm. Okay. $60 for this 1 item, I would like to pick what I get. So then I ordered 2 chef special sushi rolls. Put it this way. $24, 2 rolls, the first had a tempura shrimp in it and nothing else, then rice, then seaweed and on top cooked/warm canned tuna?!? It was awful and a disgrace to Asian cuisine.  The second was 1 piece of salmon, tuna, yellow tail and mean I piece of nigiri. Surrounded by a ring of cucumber. Before it was cut it would be a roll measured two inches in length. Pathetic.  4. The service. They had our table of 5 (us and 2 friends). Then another table of 3. We had a server per table. We ordered our apps, which came in 5 mins, our entrees about 3 mins after that. Then nothing, no drinks, no plate clearing for half an hour. To top it off they got the bill wrong. 5. Atmosphere. The local news is on a big screen tv?Country music is playing? Yet the prices are double most authentic restaurants around for the same dishes.  For myself, my wife and 2 year old son. 2 soft drinks, 1 app, 2 sushi rolls and 1 pre-frozen, flash fried orange chicken that was most likely out of a P.F. Chang's bag, $60 before t&t.  Expensive for what it was in comparison to other locals. All in all. Won't recommend. Won't return. That sushi roll, I'll never forget it, as the worst I've ever seen. Got to Harris teeter across the street. The nasty pre made is better.",

When I walked up she kept her head down, eventually looked up but continued to do what she was doing. Another party walked up from the bar and this hostess looked around me and asked them can I help you. I was very surprised she DID NOT acknowledge me at ALL. She went and sat the party then came back and asked can I help you. I don't know her name but she wore Purple or Raspberry Low Cut Converse. Hard to tell color in low lit restaurant. Our servers name was Savannah, she did a pretty good job and was very accommodating. The restaurant was very busy so I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt on the slow service. The food was just OK, the sushi we had was very good. I will probably go back and give them another chance because of Savannah's service. If it was not for her I would probably not go back. Wifey said she feels the same about this visit but she has been here a few times before today with friends and said she received pretty good service during those visits.",

Like many of the other reviewer's have already stated, the service is poor, atmosphere is odd, ambiance is lacking and the food is just average at best.  Last night I sat and watched as two employees were embracing each other in the kitchen.  It was weird, lasted longer than it should have and is not something I want to see going on in a food preparation area.    In looking at other reviews, I suspect that this place will be short lived unless the owner takes serious action to right the ship.

There appears to be a type of problem with asian-themed diners, in general, however. Their soda is always flat. I cannot recall the last time I went to an Asian restaurant and received soda that was properly balanced. Odd. Perhaps worth noting. Their tea was adequate.  Update: Ordered takeout on a weeknight, and all rice sides were coated with hair. We joked that a cook used it to wash their scalp, but that isn't too far off. Very hit or miss. Customer beware.",

We brought our 2 young children and they even had a nice kids menu.  Everything we got (including the kids food) was delicious.  The kids got tempura and hibachi...both excellent.  The adults had sushi which has to be the freshest and most delicious I've had locally.  We got one that had mango (which isn't my favorite but the wife likes it) and it was a really delicious roll.  All the flavors married together so nicely I would get it again despite the mango being in there.  The place wasn't very busy for a Friday (probably because of these reviews).  I certainly had a different experience than most on here.",

Well tonight we had take out, and i was not impressed. My boyfriend had a couple of different sushi rolls which he said where ok. I had the hibachi chicken and a side of rice. I would have given 3 stars but not even 30 mins after finishing our meals i was running to the bathroom. When i got my chicken it was cold, smelled odd and tasted rubbery but i ate it anyways because i paid $13 for it..which I am now regretting because it has upset my stomach...BAD. I have had hibachi chicken at tons of places but have never gotten sick after eating, which im assuming i was served bad chicken. I was really hoping that this place would be 5 stars, but no one should be running to the bathroom 30 mins after finishing a meal.",

We have so few dining options and this has the potential to be very good!  I only wish management would invest in their employees and in turn, make them care about their regulars.  I've always ordered the same exact meal - filet hibachi.  Sometimes it's delish and sometimes it's not actually filet and terrible.  All too many times the service has been awful, as it was once again on my last visit.  6pm on a Friday - 4 other tables were already seated upon my arrival - only 1 server.  Really?  Only 1 server on a Friday night?  The hostess seated me.  I waited 15 minutes, watching more tables being seated and the server went right over to get their orders; walking right past me.    WRONG!  Yes, I am only 1 person, but I was here first!!!!  And I am a REALLY good tipper; especially in my neighborhood!  I eventually went up to the hostess and placed my order.    My meal was delivered by the server, who threw it on the table and left.  Never apologizing.  When I was finished, I waited a bit for a bill, it never arrived.  Went to register and asked the hostess for my bill.  Paid via CC and handed her a cash tip and instructed her to put it in her pocket - by no means did the server earn a dime!  This has been the story more times than I care to admit.    Please, please, please Cherry owners and management - empower your staff so they WANT to serve the neighborhood.  In turn, also please spend the money to properly staff the busy shifts.  The neighborhood IS giving up on you!",

It takes at least  3 BAD experiences for me to stop going to a restaurant.  The past four times at Cherry have been really bad.  The last time, today:  It looks like they cooked my food on a dirty grill after burning some food.  My Hibachi Chicken has black dots and burned gunk mixed in with it.  NO more!

My only complaint, except for the fuel taste is with most hibachi places. If you are cheaping the vegetable in the fried rice to cut it down to 3 tablespoons to save a buck. I assure you if you go the opposite, people will notice and you will get more steady customers. People go back to places that care about the quality of the food and not a profit of 3 cents more on each people served. I used to get a fried rice with all sort of veggies, now I see only egg with a speck or two of veggies. Also like to have ginger sauce with the Hibachi. Two sauces are standard in most restaurants. Will be back to try again",

The staff are always kind and excited to see you when you walk in the door, and I've never had anyone mess up an order.

    "text": "High expectations and unfortunately highly disappointed.  Given the pricing at this location and the type of food offered, one would believe that the quantity and quality would reflect the price. Unfortunately, it does not.   Based on other reviews, the location is well appointed being in a new location in Fort Mill, SC that is lacking in the restaurant and food scene. However, there are other nearby Asian/Sushi restaurants that are worth the drive for a better experience such as Baxter, Pineville, Uptown, etc).  The restaurant interior is cold and uninviting and actually very odd. It is not inviting and the tables and locations are very open.  With all this being said, I think the pictures of the recent takeout we received proves my point. Salad contained a lot of water, noodles had no taste, fried and white rice tasted the same, etc.",

My husband had the Green Dragon said it was too sweet tasting but he enjoyed the Hamachi Roll. I was still hungry so ordered edamame that was good and good sized portion. Staff was friendly and place was clean three stars due to price being high for what it was.",
