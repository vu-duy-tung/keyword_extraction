There were people on a sidewalk bench, people at a tiny table, people along the sidewalk and leaning on their cars in the parking lot, all holding small brown boxes of doughnuts and sporting large, sugary smiles.  We walked through their front door and were greeted with a lengthy line and a number of people waiting around for their order, but we soon saw that this would prove to not be an issue.  The line moved along very quickly.  The cashier was extremely helpful in assisting my friend and I make a selection based upon her favorites as we had never been there before.  After deciding on two doughnuts each, we paid, were given our receipt with our order number, and found ourselves waiting for our order while watching the doughnut production process behind a transparent sneeze-guard.  It was amazing to watch the process from dough to fried doughnut ring to decorated doughnut and made the anticipation for our treats heighten.    We waited a very short amount of time, and it was nice to be entertained in the process by the doughnut making and looking to see what everyone else had ordered that we barely even heard our order number being called.  We grabbed our brown box of treasures and dug in.  Soft, sweet, and everything a doughnut should be!  It was one of our toughest decisions of the day to not go in and get another!  I would highly recommend these treats to anyone, and I feel that their service was so friendly and fast, even a dozen or more doughnuts would be a timely feat for this crew!  Thank you guys for a great and delicious experience.",

    "text": "At long last, I have found the pinnacle of doughnut making. Duck Donuts has mastered the art and stole the crown from what I had given to Krispy Kreme many moons ago. These are the best donuts alive ever had. Let me explain why...  I did not know that they serve the donuts \"fresh\" - meaning warm and made-to-order.  I needed this all my life and had no idea that I did!  I am a fan of the cakey type donut.  Donuts aren't meant to be flimsy crumby things, but decadent morsels.  KK makes a delicious airy donut that I can get served warm if I time it right, but Duck Donuts is always has the \"hot sign\" on if you know what I mean.  You pick the toppings and style of your donuts when you place your order and the literally make it to your specifications immediately after.  I thought the maple bacon would be my favorite, but it was tied with the Reeses one on the scale of awesomeness.  Both of them a 10/10.  My only recommendation is that they add a few more choices for icings and toppings. The ones they have are great and work well, but if I came here often enough, I could see myself wanting to switch it up before long.  I like that service was with a smile and that the prices were appropriate.  Too bad I am cursed to live in a state that only believes in Dunkin. But whenever I am in the Charlotte area, I guarantee this place will always get a visit from me",

    "text": "Duck Donuts = Delicious Cake Batter Donuts. You can depend on that they will always be hot and warm, because they are made to order. Does it get any better than that?  If you come on a weekend morning, just prepare yourself. It will be crowded. And you will have to wait in line. But you can stand there and watch the magic happen. This also gives you time to decide what you want. And if you can't decide what kind of donut you want, since you can make any combo from all their choices of toppings - ask for a dozen of randoms and they will create the perfect combinations for you.  Also - did you know they do donut holes? You have to call in the day prior and it does a require a minimum order of 10 dozen holes which is right around $30 or so. I can't recall the exact price now. But these are perfect for an office or school setting.",

It was very cool to see the environment and watch the staff create your masterpiece. Somewhat like an ice cream sundae.   A few not so negatives, the donuts are cake donuts. If you prefer old fashioned, this is a bit of a tricky place for you. The staff seemed less than thrilled to make so many orders come to life. For many, you can tell it was just a job. Frankly, you can see past that if they don't screw up what you order.   All the donuts will come warm and by warm, I mean hot. The kids will certainly need to let these cool for a few before digging in.",

For one. I was a fool for mistaking it for just another donut place.  The donuts are so delish here. I had two!!!  They were so warm and soft. Not like any other place I've been. I thought there's no was this town has better desserts then NY where I'm from. Uh. Wrong. Best I've had ever!!!! The batter is has to have magic in it lol. The taste is soft buttery and melts with every bite. I'm so tempted to book a flight back. Simply because I need a strawberry Duck Donut with frosting and sprinkles lol. I shall return!",

    "text": "I agree with other yelper reviews...if you're in this neighborhood and craving something sweet this place will definitely do the trick!   I stopped in before the afternoon rush, and trust me it's easy to get overwhelmed. This place has a lot going on! There are tons of flavor combinations, staff buzzing around behind the counter and those eagerly awaiting their creations.   This place gives you tons of freedom. Think of yourself as a personal chef. It's up to you to get creative. They will top your cake donut with whatever glaze and topping your prefer. There's a good bit of options but don't worry....they have plenty of suggestions that let you expire all kinds of flavor combinations.  For me, the donuts were okay. I tried a chocolate and a vanilla - with sprinkles. They aren't bad by any means. I just expected more. To be fair, I took mine to go so I had to warm them up to get the full effect on a warm donut.   But they cured my sweet tooth so for that I was happy. The service was meh. The girls seemed more interested in talking to each other than taking my order. But I'll chalk it up as a busy day.  If I'm in the area, I'll give them another try to check out another flavor combination. And see if they can completely win me over.",

    "text": "I have to say, Kevin and I are not a fan of cake donuts.  They are normally dry, dense, and leave a bad after taste.  One of my coworkers brought these donuts in one day and I thought they were good!  I told Kevin we needed to go, and he kind of had the eh, not really interested, they are cake donuts.  I somehow convinced him to try them out on a Saturday afternoon after we had finished hiking.  We arrived to Duck donuts and I ordered a maple bacon, chocolate peanut butter, strawberry blackberry, vanilla cookie, and strawberry with chocolate sprinkles (was supposed to have been taken off as I went with the strawberry blackberry instead as suggested by the guy at the counter, oh well, not an awful mistake, just unnecessary).  They were quick to make the donuts.  As soon as I got back in the car with Kevin, I opened up the box and had to have a bite (had to put the dog in the back seat and make him suffer!).  We immediately had a bite of the maple bacon and strawberry blackberry - both excellent!  Kevin was already hooked!  They are awesome when they are warm and freshly made, of course very messy that way, but oh so worth it.    We tried the others we tried the next morning - reheated up in the microwave - still good!!  The chocolate peanut butter was also a hit.  The strawberry with chocolate sprinkles, eh, a miss, and really should have not been part of the order.  The vanilla cookie was also just okay.  I think it would have been better had the cookies actually been cut up chunks of the cookie to bite, rather than the fine crumb, can't really taste that it is a cookie on top.  Kevin already wants to go back, more than I do, which is a huge surprise, but I think they won him over with the large quantity of crumbled bacon on the donut.  We can't wait to go back and try others.  Overall, excellent, the best cake donuts and at a wonderful price!  We will be back.  Only con is that they have very little seating inside and do not have much  outdoor seating (which is sad for a very dog friendly area), but it's not like they have the room for tables and chairs either.",

    "text": "Go ahead, I dare you! Just try walking through the doors of Duck Donuts without smiling. It's nearly impossible! Personally, I felt a little like one of the kids touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory as I stood in line on my first visit. I could almost hear the tune playing in my head, \"Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka.\"  As I tried to make sense of things, one-by-one, giddy people placed their orders in front of me as if mesmerized by some strange spell. Nearly half, like myself, needed to be instructed how to order and what their options were (which at first, seemed daunting.) You order, pay and wait anxiously for your number to be called while your yellow cake donuts are created fresh - fried, coated, dipped, sprinkled, topped and/or drizzled - on the assembly line behind a glass partition.  Important Note: You will need a napkin to wipe away your inevitable drool if you choose to observe yours made. Be warned though, watching increases your wait time.  Making a choice can be difficult. I had intended to just order two - their top sellers: Bacon & Maple Glazed and Cinnamon Sugar - and yet what came out if my mouth was something totally different - those two plus for four more. Hey, it makes sense I rationalized, you get a discount on a half dozen!  The Bacon & Maple was pretty incredible as was the Cinnamon Sugar. (For the record, I had only half of each.) The Lemon glaze was a little too sweet because of either the confectionary sugar dusting our due to the fact that it was the third one I tried. The other three were the vanilla glaze, the chocolate covered with vanilla drizzle and one just like that covered in coconut and peanuts. Yes, my middle aged stomach was a little nauseas afterward (and a little now just recalling it.)  The coffee was just okay as was the service. The sanitary rating was a 94. Overall, it's a fun place with good donuts; however, it will still not not help me break my Krispy Kreme addiction. I will return though but next time I'll take my kids. Now if I could just get that darn Willy Wonka tune out of my head!",

I have seen the light, and it's covered in icing and sprinkles.  What works for Duck Donuts is the density, or lack thereof, of their cake donut. Their donuts still have that chewy mouth-feel of a yeast donut, yet are substantial enough to hold up to some crazy icings, toppings, and drizzles. And crazy they are! I ordered a donut with peanut-butter icing, chocolate sprinkles, and salted caramel drizzle. Take that Krispy Kreme!   The flavors were delicious, the coffee was hot, the service was attentive, but it was the glazed donut that really took the cake. Bliss...",

Super fresh, soft, warm, sweet and delicious donuts prepared right in front of your eyes.  To be honest I didn't realize these were cake batter donuts until I read some of the reviews here.  Love the taste.   A small place in a strip mall, always a little bit crowd, majority of them are kids running around the shop.  They also have couple tables inside to dine in and offer coffee as well.",

So we went on a Sunday morning about 9:30, couple people in front of us, not crowded parking lot. But by the time we left, still before 10am, the line was out the door.  The maple bacon donut was amazing. Hard to describe why it is so amazing, so just try it.  They used some tasty bacon, no bacon bits. And the donut texture was yummy, cake batter style. And they come out warm.   I just wanna go back and try everything. So glad we checked it out.",

It is located in that little pocket of shops between Kenilworth and the East Blvd Harris Teeter (behind Menchies) Duck Donuts is a little more simplistic than I was expecting. You have one type of base donut.   You then choose the type of icing you want. Off the top of my head, there were about 8-10 choices. I chose one with Orange icing and one with maple icing.   Next you chose a topping to go on each donut. I think there were only five options here. I went with chocolate sprinkles on my orange iced donut and bacon on my maple iced donut. They also had coconut, peanuts and regular sprinkles. There are about 40-50 different combinations you can make between icing and toppings. The ones I had were pretty delicious. They also came out fresh. My donuts were still hot when I got home with them five minutes later. Ultimately I was not blown away to the point of now having to fight the urge to return, but they were very good and a great new place to grab breakfast. I'll be back for sure but think I can limit this to a once a month place instead of a once a week need.",

Unfortunately I am in the yeast risen donuts camp and I refuse to acknowledge cake donuts as a legitimate donut.  That said I still really enjoyed their fresh out of the fryer cake donuts. Though some of the glazes were a bit too sweet for me such as the maple glaze the salty toppings help curb some of that sugar. Their store employees are helpful and the place is clean and no nonsense. Get your donuts, get your coffee and get to work.  A charming concept that may bring me back if I am ever in a donut emergency and there is no yeast risen donut option around.",

Per my lovely Yelper friend Bianka's request I will add they are not airy like Krispy Kreme, nor heavy and cakey like Dunkin Donuts - they're right in the middle. You choose the cream (lemon, strawberry, maple etc) and toppings (sugar, coconut, bacon etc). They are also not oversized like most gourmet doughnuts, so I guess I'll just call them MTO.",

Innovative concept- although probably inspired by Krispy Kreme's operating equipment to form and cook the donuts so you can get a just-made warm product.   Basic in that there is only one real donut type made, with the variety coming in the eyes of the customer who chooses a glaze and a topping. For me, the peanuts topping beat out the bacon one, but it's all personal. No filled donuts offered.   Normally one finds cake donuts dry. But the beauty here is how moist and rich they taste. Cooked to slightly underdone, I assume on purpose, they were incredibly delicious.   Only negative might be that they can become cloyingly sweet after a gob of glaze. Maybe next time I'll try a plain one.    I applaud them on pricing. Individual donuts are $1.20 each, certainly enough for a good profit, but reasonable for this special treat- and probably why there can be crowds inside (wait goes quickly though).",

You pick a coating, a topping, and then a drizzle and you can do as many as you like for only $1.30/each.  That is a heck of deal.  Even though they are making them as you order they are pretty stinking fast.  I grew up in the south so cake donuts are not something I have been accustomed to but these are really good especially when they are just made and you sit down and eat them in the store.  I am a fan and will continue to go.  Probably my third favorite doughnut spot.  My favorite one is the peanut butter coating with oreo topping and the salted caramel drizzle.",

The donuts are made fresh and have a very nice crisp with a soft inside. They taste similar to beignets. I ate the donuts about 10mins after I ordered and the outside crisp prevents them from getting soggy from the glazing. They about 3\" in diameter, and in my opinion, that size could not be more perfect.   Donuts cost $1.20, which is a steal in the boutique donut market.  I originally hail from Chicago where Glazed & Infused dominate, with Stan's close behind. Duck has them both beat. Their combination of freshness, price, size and texture make for a perfect donut.",

    "text": "Doughnuts are certainly a treat to be held (and eaten) on specifically special occasions. Or, in the case of Duck Donuts, any time the urge befalls your day. Having good, nay, fantastic doughnuts in the hood is something that is somewhat of a foreign concept to Charlotte, for the most part. You've got your larger brands with plenty of presence, but having a smaller company show up in good ol' Crown Town is a welcome sight.   Now, doughnuts are not too difficult to make acceptable in most doughnut-eaters' eyes. Serve em warm, slathered with glaze, and not much else. You're on your merry way to a great day when hot doughnuts are thrown in the mix. Duck Donuts is doing it right. Though, their process is pretty unique from others.   First of all, the menu is rather simple. Doughnuts, coffee, a few breakfast sandwiches, and a few other things here and there. You order your doughnuts from the counter by singles or by the dozen, they are prepared on-the-spot, and served at the other end of the counter.   The apparatus that forms and fries the doughnuts is so rad. It's a automatic dispenser that drops the perfectly formed doughnuts into the oil and then moves them along a conveyor belt. It's unlike any other I've seen. They do happen to have two of these guys for when the lines get longer and they need to crank out more fried dough.   Note: ALL of their doughnuts are of the same base. (Cake Doughnuts) I.e. Not a yeast-based recipe. They are actually rather light and possess a perfect amount of crunch on the exterior. Not super heavy and dense like some other cake doughnuts of the world.    So far, we've tried a handful -- Lemon Cinnamon Sugar Glazed Peanut Butter Strawberry  By far, the glazed wins every single time. It's just so perfect and easy. Eat them warm or after a few hours and they retain the same flavor and texture. I'm sure heating them in the oven wouldn't be a bad call either.   Very impressed with these guys. Their varieties of doughnuts will certainly win over tons of local Dilworth eating talent and I'm sure we'll plan on many a visit in the near future.   Welcome to the 'hood, Duck Donuts!",

Because see I did not go inside, I was told to go online and pick what I wanted on my donuts. Well I couldn't find all of the toppings they offer on the website. Which made me picking my own personal donut hard. I ended up picking one of their most popular donut.",

    "text": "My first Duck Donuts experience was amazing! It's left me wanting more, and more, and more. I will admit, walking in and looking at everything left me feeling overwhelmed and confused. Make your own donuts, pick your own toppings, what to choose, what to get? But here's what you need to know: all donuts come with the same base donut (which is absolutely amazing!) Than you pick the \"glaze\" (chocolate, cinnamon sugar, vanilla, etc) and than add one topping (sprinkles, chocolate drizzle, powdered sugar). Donuts are ready in minutes, fresh and hot (easy to devour within seconds).   If nothing else, ask for recommendations from the cashiers or select one of their \"pre-selected\" options. Once I tasted the donut, I was sold! It's so delicious and inspires you to return with creativity!",

But I suggest walking here if you're already in the area (2 block radius) because parking isn't friendly here.   The donuts are warm and the variety of toppings will allow you to get your creative mind going. I ordered half a dozen (all different combinations including the maple bacon) and that totaled to about $8.   However, I've always come early in the morning before the rush of the day, so visiting during a wonderful Spring afternoon isn't something I will probably do again. It was busy and the cashier seemed annoyed.  A Duck Donut will place a smile on your face and satisfy your sweet tooth, so if you're wanting to give a local place a try on donuts then go check them out.",

Well I've been really taking care of myself and eating extremely well and was craving something sweet. I walk 3 miles on my lunch break each day and didn't realise how extremely close i walk to this establishment.. WOW, the girls inside are super friendly they were cleaning up as it was around 12:30pm but they both engaged in pleasant conversation with me l. I have never ordered there before myself so i did t realise they were hot and made to order. I didn't want to completely blow my healthy eating so rather than the maple bacon  , yum ..  i opted for the lemon  glaze with raspberry drizzle and it did not disappoint. It was hit and i ate it slow to savour every bite it was exactly what i had been craving and i will be sure to indulge again seeing they are also very inexpensive..  Great place !",

It is a cake based donut that seems to be fried in oil.. this ruins the texture of the donut and allows the donut to retain a lot of the oil! I couldn't hold the donut without it crumbling and falling apart.  I ordered a dozen donuts so I could I try as many flavors as possible! I came to the realization that there was only one flavor but many different \"decorations;\" they all taste of oil and sugar! It was extremely difficult to pinpoint most of the flavors! So much so I started blindfolding people in the parking lot and having them try a donut and tell me the flavor. The consensus was that no one could taste anything but sugar and oil..  2/5 because the prices were at least attractive.  Conclusion: I won't be back, nor recommend, and will continue to look for the best donuts in Charlotte.",

I'm so excited to have them here in Charlotte even though it's quite a haul from my neck of the woods to Dilworth.   Fresh, warm cake doughnuts are made while you watch in anticipation. They smell heavenly and are delectable even plain.  With the infinite array of toppings, they are amazing. It's best to fill out an order sheet and customize away. All toppings are included in the price.   Simple cinnamon sugar--unbeatable.  Dunked in chocolate--decadent.  Topped in zesty lemon glaze--OMG!    The toppings can be combined: Vanilla drizzled with chocolate.  Lemon drizzled with strawberry.  Chocolate coated in coconut.   The possibilities are endless. . .  And you really can't go wrong customizing a doughnut. In the mood for maple bacon, then go for it!  I will be back far too often. This is whole different experience than a Krispy Kreme (which is also amazing). They are almost different food groups.",

Of course they're probably just teenagers and got an attitude sliding our donuts across the counter when it was done.  I believe the manager was on site but disregarded how her employees were doing.  If you work in a place where you are preparing something, I would recommend being aware of where your hands have been.  It's not very appetizing to see someone make your donuts after rubbing her nose.",

Good assortment of flavors, toppings, and glazes but I was a little disappointed by there being no filled donuts or apple fritters etc.. we ordered a dozen $15 and they where made to order by hand which the kids thought was cool. My fav was the maple bacon but I've had my eye on this donut for awhile!! Also had French toast, vanilla w/ Oreo crumbles, chocolate with salted Carmel, strawberry with powdered sugar.. all of them were great and we will definitely be back again!!",

They offer some cool flavors for coatings and toppings and my family thoroughly enjoyed the maple glaze with bacon topping! They only offer cake donuts, but you won't be missing yeast when a hot Duck donut is melting in your mouth.  There isn't much of a dining area, but the atmosphere was buzzing and the shop is in a sweet location.  This place is a must if you live in Charlotte - I  look forward to making the half-hour drive to experience Duck Donuts again soon!",

    "text": "Mmmm what a treat! Duck Donuts's freshly made donuts were just what I needed on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The donuts are made to order and are only $1.20 so you know I couldn't settle for just one.   Naturally, I ordered a half dozen:   1. Glaze with coconut  2. Orange glaze  3. Peanut butter glaze 4. Strawberry glaze with rainbow sprinkles 5. Maple glaze with bacon 6. The daily special- cinnamon sugar with vanilla glaze  Wow these were awesome! My favorite was the glaze with coconut. It was delectable! The donuts are soft, but also a little crispy around the edges. I liked the fact that you could essentially build your own donut. You can mix and match the glaze (ex: orange glaze with vanilla glazed on top= orange dreamcicle donut). The only downside is that they only have one batter- cake. So don't expect to get a chocolate donut here.   Ps. This is also a grab and go location. There are only 3 2 person tables inside with about 6 bar stools along the window, however there are benches outside.",

The simple method of being able to create whatever combination of flavored available is enough to get most people excited, especially a child. I waited a week after the opening hoping the crowds would ease up a bit. We got there mid afternoon, and there were only a few other patrons inside which gave her enough time to decide what she wanted.  A short time later, the number was called and she received her box full of warm goodies. At first bite, she was in love. They were warm and looked absolutely delicious. My heart lies with cupcakes, so I didn't have any of her doughnuts, I was just happy she enjoyed them.  She says she's never going back to Krispy Kreme again.",

As you can tell by my 1st donut, sugar overload is rarely a problem. But this one was just overboard. And I love peanut butter.

Duck donuts also offers some breakfast sandwich options and other treats like muffins and yogurt but I think they have me with the donuts!!!  The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is a good spot but kinda hidden in the Kenliworth Commons shopping mall.  Inside the shop there is lots of standing room and space to view the donuts being freshly made and topped with all the delicious toppings! They also have some seating and tables available.

These blow them out of the water, probably in taste and caloric content (don't quote me on that though).   I've taken a few people here and every single one has said they will come back again after their next meal... it's that good.",

These donuts are a bit heavier than donuts that I am used to but overall good. I think it's a cake battered donut that's deep fried.

You can customize your donut with different glazes and toppings, and they also have different drinks and coffee with quite a few Torani syrups. The ordering process was simple and quick, and my donut came out very quickly. The donut was also HOT, definitely not day old or even hour-old donuts here.  I chose the French toast daily special with maple icing, cinnamon sugar, and powdered sugar. The maple icing was good but mostly just sweet and not a ton of maple flavor. The donut itself wasn't a super dense cake donut (which I really love) but also wasn't a super airy Krispy Kreme style, so a good balance that most people would enjoy. Overall the donut was tasty but pretty small. For the quickness with specialized options and not too steep of a price, it wasn't bad though!",

Although it is an old fashioned cake donut base, it has a lightness to it like that of an airy fried donut. I had mine iced with peanut butter icing that had even a peanut butter lover like me throwing in the towel. The bacon topping is a perfect addition to the savory peanut butter and anyone who has ever combined bacon with peanut butter knows exactly what I'm talking about. Regretfully, I ate my donut extremely quickly and did not savor it nearly enough. When I return to Charlotte, I will definitely try a strawberry iced donut with coconut or one of their other bazillion flavor combinations.",

The customer service was quite good. On my visit, there was a staff of young people working. I really appreciated the great customer services provided...with a smile.  I can't wait to try some of the seasonal options.",

I was running kind of late and didn't really know what to order, but the staff at Duck Donuts were really helpful in explaining the pricing structure and giving flavor suggestions. As someone who gets ordering anxiety when I am in a line, no-one wants to be that annoying person taking forever, I really appreciate that they offer a paper menu where you can stand off to the side to mark your order.   Ended up ordering a variety of donuts including maple bacon (the best thing ever), lemon/coconut, oreo cookie, and strawberry. Not sure about how they all tasted, but there were no leftovers which is a great indication of the quality!",

Nothing too bad, I ordered 6 doughnuts and they got 2 wrong but I didn't notice till I got home. I was expecting the usual doughnut shop experience where u walk in see what u want in the case and pick what u want. This place was different and it threw me off. You walk in and they have all of the doughnuts that they make printed out on multiple cards and u pick what u want and they make them. I never experienced that before and it was kinda weird, she showed me my doughnuts before I walked out but I didn't notice the mishap till I got home. I ordered 2 of my doughnuts with coconut on them and that's the one the got wrong. They just gave me 2 with chocolate on top. The service was quick and the doughnuts we're good. I just stopped in to give this place a try it's not a place I pass on the regular so I don't know the next time I'll give them a try.",

I was craving something sweet when I realized I hadn't stopped in for a while and boy was I glad I did. I got my regular strawberry glazed with Oreos crumbles on top but got even more excited when I noticed they had a key lime glaze for the spring time. I didn't even know this existed and knew I had to try it. I got the cinnamon sugar donut with key lime drizzle on top (a suggested flavor). It was everything I could ever imagine with amazing flavors and soft dough texture. I will be dreaming about that key lime glaze for a while now",

I absolutely love Duck Donuts! What I liked about it most is that they serve it warm! Sooooooo good warm! It just melts in your mouth!   We informed the person working there that it's our first time. He was very friendly and explained the menu to us and how it worked. And even gave us some recommendations and what some customer favourites are! We went with flavours that we would typically like and absolutely loved it! The flavours weren't too empowering, it was just right! We wish we could've brought some home to share with our families (or not)!",

When I say custom, I mean anyway you want it. How about a vanilla glaze with coconut flakes and raspberry drizzle? Don't be shy, they cater to your preferences.  If you know you're going to place a big order with a lot of different flavored donuts, go ahead and grab an order sheet on the stand as soon as you walk in and fill it out. That way you can hand it to the cashier when you're ready and keep the line moving. Make sure to grab whatever they're sampling near the service counter as well!  First time here? My suggestion is the crowd favorite Maple-Bacon with Salted Caramel Drizzle. A bit more plain but my favorite is the Cinnamon Sugar with Raspberry Drizzle. You really can't go wrong with any combination you choose. You even get to watch them make it right in front of you!  Can you get cheaper donuts in Charlotte? Maybe. But after you've found your favorite at Duck, why would you want to go anywhere else?",

Alas, they didn't send me to the moon.   They were nice and I was glad they weren't too sweet, but the dough texture was much less fluffy than I like; the donut actually felt a little lumpy. Also the frosting didn't taste like the chocolate or cream it appeared to emulate--it was bland. Don't get me wrong, I'll take a free donut any day. But I wasn't enticed to go back for a second.   Gotta say, though, I did love the theme and am always stoked when a retailer supports science, regardless of whether or not there are commercial underlying motivations.",

It was our first time eating at Duck Donuts. My fiance walked up and ordered immediately- bacon, egg, and cheese on a donut. I took a while to decide. The cashier told me to take my time and that there was no rush. I asked her for a suggestion-- she pointed out about 7 donuts that she liked and I chose two of those suggestions (the boardwalk and lemon raspberry). We both ordered coffee.  The breakfast sandwich and the donuts came out nice and warm! I was able to taste a piece of the breakfast sandwich as well -- very tasty! The coffee was nice, as well. It didn't have that old or burnt taste!!   Will definitely visit again!",

Summer is like next week and I have no self control!  I am however a simple gal and my fave is the glazed.  So light and heavenly.  It's difficult to have just one and also wait long enough to not burn my mouth....yes that's right people!  They serve them fresh, hot and made to order!  The upside is they are located near a yoga studio so why not treat yourself after a class?  I bought two dozen to a neighbors' party and asked the duck server to mix it up with a nice variety.  Needless to say my neighbors were cursing me and thanking me at the same time and the fan favorite was definitely the maple bacon but I don't think anyone was disappointed!",

    "text": "A donut is a donut, is a cake, is a pancake. (A tribute to my favorite scene from Girl, Interrupted.)  I successfully avoided donuts for 6 months, only to be taken down 2wks ago in one fell swoop during an intense 2 day event where unlimited free donuts were available. Returned to Charlotte and haven't slowed down. That 'famine-feast' thing I guess.  So, Duck Donuts. Mentioned to the cheerful woman at the counter it was my first time. She gave me the run down (which of course I quietly already knew, being an informed yelper) and it was showtime. Despite the warnings of excessive oiliness from other reviews, ordered both a maple & a chocolate coconut. She spied my donut lust, so offered at no charge one that came out too small to sell. Hell f***ing yeah. Chose vanilla.  While I awaited my order, dove in to the gift. Warm, moist, pleasing. The other two arrived, and the maple RULED. At one point, I felt like I was eating hot pancakes. Thick & cakey.  I did observe something, which is more of a note to management than anything else. The card machine was down, so cardholders were asked to leave their card numbers for processing later. One particular patron was visibly uncomfortable with this arrangement but agreed. The nice woman at the counter did try to run the transaction several times, but the system remained stubborn. Thinking the woman was just buying 1 donut, I began to offer to pay, but she had a whole box and I only had $3 cash left. The woman even doubled back before she left and asked the clerk to ensure her card info would be destroyed. All I could think was \"just give her the da*n donuts!\". I mean, what, it would have set them back, what, $12??? Plus, the store was closing in 15min anyway. The woman was clearly concerned, and a man eventually came out from back, who seemed managerial. It would have been an enormous act of customer appreciation and bred tremendous brand loyalty to just give her the donuts at no charge, thank her for her patience, and apologize for the delay.   After the 2.5 donuts I ate, did feel slightly nauseous. Only one next time.",

I had them a couple times when my boyfriend brought them home to me but I promise there is not other experience like actually going in, ordering them and watching them get made.

The donuts are the same, or at least I think they are--though the ambiance is cutesy, it doesn't have the shack-esque charm of the home location, which mingles with ocean air to make fried dough slathered in liquid sugar taste better.   Mostly, I'm happy to see a homemade donut shop in the area, and would love more. These actual donuts are good, but the toppings seem to have that funky glossy additive that makes them look pretty but stick to the roof of your mouth, which I hate. I stick to the cinnamon sugar and am a happy camper.",

I've been getting donuts from their original location in the Outer Banks for years, and I had no idea there was a Charlotte location until very recently. This location did not disappoint! The donuts are very cake-y, which is without a doubt my favorite kind of donut. You order what frosting and topping you want on each donut, and now you can order a drizzle on top of the donut too!  The one downside, as someone who has been to the original location, is the different atmosphere. The original location seems a bit cozier and more welcoming than this location, but the food is just as delicious.",

    "text": "Overall, I'm not buying the hype.  My inner fat kid refuses to rate a doughnut shop anywhere below 3 stars, but the reality is that I just wasn't impressed.    Having been to Duck Donut locations along the coast, I'm not sure why I thought this one would be much different.  Let me clarify by saying up front that this is just my opinion.  To each his own, but I don't dig \"caky\" doughnuts.  Keep it flaky, not caky.  Think Krispy Kreme.  Are you with me?  Anyhow, caky it is at this place.  Again, my experience was less than stellar.  It had been years since I last visited an OBX location, so I needed a refresher on how things worked.  The employee behind the counter gave me a look as though I had just asked him to multiply 3,288 by 1,787 in his head.  Eventually I figured out that the doughnuts aren't sitting in a window to be selected until sellout.  Each doughnut essentially has the same caky base, and is then \"topped\" with your selections in an effort to transform them into something else.  Want a chocolate doughnut?  Well, you're gonna get a cake doughnut topped with warm chocolate goo.  Basically a cake hot from the oven that was frosted too soon, creating a soup like consistency that can hardly be called icing.  Not.  A.  Fan.  It's a literal hot mess.  Giving one of these to anyone under the age of 14 is just asking for it.  Hopefully you have baby wipes handy because no napkin in the world could clean up the aftermath.  I myself had little paper pieces stuck between my fingers clinging to chocolate schma, after the closest napkin disintegrated in my hands, until I could get to a sink.  That was after eating only half the doughnut, as the warm chocolate goo started to make me nauseous.    The shop is tucked back in the never lands of the Kenilworth Commons shopping center.  Seating in the place is limited.  The coffee was nothing special.  The lack of service was mind-blowing considering the place had yet been open a week when I visited.  After paying, I awaited my doughnuts and coffee only to realize that the cashier should've given me my coffee cup.  I went back over to claim said cup, but he was still clamoring to find the solution to 3,288 X 1,787.  Hopeless.   BTW, in case you were wondering, 3,288 X 1,787 = 5,875,656 You're welcome.",

If you like a cake style doughnut then you will LOVE THESE GUYS. You can get creative with their toppings which are as traditional as chocolate icing and sprinkles to as trendy as maple icing and bacon bits! (Seriously though, the latter taste just like pancakes and bacon breakfast). Add to all this that the doughnuts are always fresh and warm...yep this one is a winner! If it weren't for childhood devotion to the Krispy Kreme style doughnut I'd give 5 stars.",

It can be hard to catch that \"hot\" light at Krispy Kreme, but the donuts are ALWAYS fresh here. My favorites were the plain, regular-glaze, maple-icing and cinnamon sugar. You can mix and match your dozens to fit your office's preferences and make sure everybody gets what they like. And, because the donuts are so damn fresh, they are still warm after your commute to wherever you're going.  The donuts are large, so one is equal to two Krispy Kreme donuts in my opinion.   This location is totally accessible on the bus, if you are not a driver in Charlotte. You can catch the outbound 6K (Kings Drive) and get off at the East Blvd and Scott Ave stop, and walk about one country block. Then go home via taking the 25 to the lightrail, and lightrail to the bus station.  4 stars instead of 5, only because the place could look just a tad cleaner.",

They have several options for coatings and drizzles and topping so I was having a hard time on what to try. I ended up getting a half dozen and was impressed! Will definitely say lives up to its reputation for sure and a must try! All donuts are made to order which is a win! Can't remember what six I picked but the picture sure does look good!

Every doughtnut is made just seconds before it's served.  The one downside is that the doughnut base is always the same. In other words, you can't get a blueberry cake doughnut or a sourcream doughnut, which are my favorites. Still, their doughnut base is delicious, and you can do a lot with it.",

The toppings are also so good! I love that you can customize your donuts or pick some of their topping combos. My favorite is the vanilla icing with cinnamon sugar.  They are also service dog friendly and have a wonderful sign outside saying so and also stating they can spot fake service dogs. I've spoken to an employee there and her daughter has a service dog so I definitely believe the sign.  No matter how busy it is, they always get the order out quickly and I find the prices to be very reasonable!  100% recommend!",

    "text": "If you're looking for donuts, do not come here.   I ordered half a dozen donuts, a regular coffee, and a toffee iced coffee. First, the customer service was really bad...I had never been here or any Duck Donuts store so I didn't know how the process goes. When I asked the cashier, she wasn't friendly at all, but just told us how it is. That's fine. I paid for my things and got the coffees. First of all, the iced coffee was really disgusting, it straight up tasted like toffee syrup. That's fine, whatever. So I went to order a milk for the donuts...but the cashier did not know what she was talking about. The people in front of me got upset because she gave them the wrong information about MILK...I ignored it because I was super excited for the donuts but they got the order wrong. We ordered a strawberry spring edition, vanilla with Oreo, chocolate with peanut butter and salted caramel, s'mores, blueberry with lemon glaze, and a maple bacon. They put coconut flakes on the chocolate peanut butter...and asked if it was okay? No. Obviously not because we don't like coconut nor did we order it. But I ignored it again because I saw all the great reviews and I was still excited. When we got the donuts, I was ecstatic! They were warm and they smelled good, but oh...they were not donuts. They were cake-like and so disappointing. More than a cake-like donut, they were just cake. The taste did not even compare to a donut and the entire experience was so underwhelming and disappointing. I was also sad because the spring edition just had sprinkles and the chocolate peanut butter was just chocolate with a bunch of peanuts.  If you want REAL donuts and coffee, don't come here.",

Like Jimmy D., I am definitely a yeast donut girl not a cake donut girl. Like everyone says, they are hot and glazed to order. They were very sweet and very sticky so no scrimping on the glaze here. I tried a plain glazed and a chocolate glazed - under $3. Inexpensive and nothing to complain about just not my scene.

Seriously I cannot emphasis enough how phenomenal these were.  They are fresh donuts, literally made within 1 minute of me ordering, and you get them nice and warm. For other yelpers complaining about how \"difficult\" the menu is to figure out how to order... you probably have a low IQ because it's very simple and everywhere you look in the restaurant there are signs telling you how to order which again is pretty simple, pick your flavor and toppings, pay and wait.  The toppings are fresh and flavorful, definitely not too sweet on anything. They are also extremely reasonably priced for specialty donuts 4 for $5!!   Staff was sweet, clearly take pride in their work. Definitely a must try place with an awesome concept - I mean really how often do you get to create your own donuts?!",

It was hot and fresh, which was good. For me, it was a bit too rich and decadent, so I'm glad we shared. My boyfriend, however, could not get enough of it and mumbled the words \"awesome\" and \"delicious\" in between bites.

The only downfall of this particular location is how rude one of the workers (Chris) was. We got up to the counter with our order written on the order form and handed it to him. He started punching it into the register, then rolled his eyes and pointed to the form without saying anything. We explained that we wanted 2 donuts with maple icing and bacon. It was our first time ever at Duck Donuts and we mistakenly put a check mark under the \"Bacon\" column, rather than a \"2\". The way he handled it was just rude. The other person at the register, whose name was Hayden, I think, seemed much, much nicer. She was very chatty with everyone she was helping and just seemed genuinely kind.  Either way, we will be back. THIS is the place to go if you want delicious donuts.",

Thankfully they were more than welcoming and helped us through the process. They showed us that we could make our own or follow the specialty donuts guide. We ordered the cinnamon donut, the beach, french toast, and my boyfriend made a custom one with caramel and a peanut butter frosting. It only took them about 8 minutes to get us our order. The donuts are a perfect size where you can have 2-3, 2 donuts were a perfect amount for me. The donuts were soft in the inside and had a crunch on the exterior. My favorite was the french toast, I loved the maple frosting.   There is plenty of parking! The staff is very friendly and seem to really enjoy working there. Prices are very reasonable. You can get them to go or eat them in the shop. It is great treat to bring to the office or a prefect start to your weekend morning.   Can't wait to go back and try more!",

They weren't nearly as friendly or fast as the Huntersville location and the toppings looked a little sloppy comparatively as well. That kind of thing worries me because my sister is allergic to coconut and cross contamination is a truly frightening thing.  We ordered 6 white and chocolate glaze with oreo crumble on top. Our donuts were mostly correct and when I gently pointed out that they missed 2 with the chocolate glaze they put a massive amount on all of them even the ones that had it already. It made a shell on top of the oreos which made them harder to eat.   Not the Duck I would send people to for sure.",

A coworker's husband brought in donuts for umher a few weeks ago and after trying them, I decided I needed to get my own half dozen to enjoy at home!

The parking lot is huge and located off the main road, behind the shop. The staff are friendly and there are a bunch of pictures to help you choose your flavors. In and out in under 5 minutes! Definately will be going back for more!   Pro tip: Not sure on what flavor you want-order a half dozen different donuts, cut them in half and share with a friend!",

With that being said I am judging them without trying to be bias since it's not my favorite type of doughnut. If you like cake doughnuts then this is your place. They are made when you order which can take a little time especially on a busy day. But it's worth it! The last time I went the doughnuts were amazing, but the customer service could have been better. There were 3 female workers making the doughnuts & 2 of them got into a disagreement while on the job & you could hear it. I don't believe in displaying this type of non professionalism in front of customers & I felt like the friction between the workers caused my order to take even longer to get ready.",

    "text": "First time hearing about and seeing Duck Donuts since traveling out east. Duck Donuts started in the outer banks of Duck, North Carolina. Here's how it works: made-to-order style - they freshly create vanilla cake donuts and then you follow their three step process of picking a coating, topping, and a drizzle. You may totally customize each donut to your likings or you can also pick from their menu of classics & fan favorites. I decided to make my experience more fun and create my own half dozen here. With so many options such as Oreo, bacon pieces, cinnamon sugar, shredded coconut, vanilla icing, maple, blueberry, strawberry, etc. you can piece together some great tasting creations. My personal favorite is the peanut butter icing. Add that with shredded coconut + some rainbow sprinkles on top and you have yourself a nice warm yummy treat. Because they're served warm, the key is to eat them right away if you can. You'll get the most enjoyment out of them as they actually do melt in your mouth. Each donut will just disintegrate as the sweetness tickles your tongue. Grab a dozen as these donuts definitely don't last long.",

So many different creations you can make but my favorite without fail is the maple bacon glazed donut.  I also had a bacon egg and cheese donut which I think was almost a part of a complete breakfast.  If you are in the dilworth area, stop in and try it and you won't regret it.  Will return.

I have a Duck Donuts a few miles from my home and I've had it bookmarked for several months but never visited or tasted them until in Charlotte, that's all thanks to a friend that helped me get my doughnut fix this weekend.   This is a franchise and they have locations across the U.S., primarily along the East Coast but two locations in CA. This one is located Kenilworth Commons in Charlotte and they're open 7 days a week. The first shop opened in Duck, NC; that's where the name comes from, for those that are curious, like me.   All of the donuts are made-to-order and my friend ordered a variety dozen. The famous Duck Donut is a freshly-made vanilla cake donut that you coat, top and drizzle as you wish. The donuts are warm, delicious, and just the way you like them according to their website. Of course I couldn't try all 12 so I tried 4 (I cut the doughnuts in quarters) ;). I tried blueberry icing,  cinnamon sugar,  strawberry icing and one more that I can't remember, my bad! I do remember that I enjoyed each cake donut and the toppings/frosting on each, they were soft and yummy. It reminded me of the doughnuts I had as a kid. So, I have to agree with the website, they were delicious.",

This is a must stop for me anytime I am in Charlotte!    One kind of negative thing about this place is that service is very slow because of the freshly made donuts.

The rest is all just extra sugar and makes the the donuts too sweet.  The best part is that they were warm.",

On a whim, while our power was out, we went to Duck Donuts and...  Well, golly.  1. They're crazy reasonably priced. 2. They're crazy varied in their toppings. 3. THEY'RE CRAZY FREAKING GOOD.  Best in Charlotte, hands down. Warm with chocolate frosting for me, and maple with bacon for the husband. We both also really enjoyed the cinnamon sugar ones, though they could do with a little less sugar and a little more cinnamon.  Bravo, Duck Donuts. You guys are deeeeeelish.",

My run group even had a Thursday morning run in which we decided to run from the running store, through Dilworth, and finish at Duck Donuts (to \"check it out\").  Granted, we came right when they opened at 6am (our runs start at 5:30am)... so I think the staff was expecting a 'normal' morning and ended up being a bit \"deer-in-headlights\" that morning.  All in good fun.  They took us in stride (there were about 20-25 of us so it took a while (especially since they make the donuts to order for you).  I tried the maple glaze with bacon topping and it was amazing.  We also just finished doing like 3 miles so it probably put me over my daily calories, but it was darn worth it.  All the different glazes and toppings, there is a donut for everyone here.  I've even started seeing some cyclists ride up East Blvd, with a Duck Donuts box tucked into their cycling jerseys in the back.  This location has a small parking lot and shares it with the other businesses.  The important thing to note is that its not in the \"main\" lot where the Harris Teeter is... it is one away... closer to Kenilworth and next to the Bag Lady.  I know Charlotte/North Carolina is \"KK\" territory, but I'm glad to see these guys in the Queen City.  I'm all about competition to make each other better.",

I'm a fan of donuts that are light, soft and flaky (like the original glazed from KK). These are not like that, yet they still impressed me. I loved that these donuts were warm, fresh and MTO. They start with a vanilla cake base and you are able to add icing (strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, lemon, maple etc.) and other toppings like bacon bits, sprinkles, coconut flakes and more. They also have special donuts like orange creamsicle and pumpkin!   My donut came out to be about $1.29~ a piece. It's well worth it. See you at Duck Donuts!",

I wouldn't normally make a special trip to actually buy donuts and usually ignore this section in the supermarket. That was until Duck Donuts came to town!  Worth the hype and more! I visited Duck Donuts on a Saturday afternoon. There were about 15 people there, so no long lines and was served pretty quickly. I ordered 3 donuts- the maple glaze with bacon on top, lemon, and orange creamsicle. I wanted to love the bacon maple donut since I love bacon so much (it's meat candy!), but something about the savory bacon and cake donut didn't taste the best together. So I guess I prefer a sweet topping instead of savory. The lemon and orange donut were excellent. So no complaints in the sweet tasting donut department.    They weren't kidding when they say it's a HOT donut. It was hotter than I expected. That is what makes it great. It is 10 times more delicious eaten hot then some stale thing that has been sitting around for days. I don't even think I chewed, I just swallowed it whole! I thought it was going to be a heavier consisting, but it was pretty light. Hence me eating all 3 donuts in less than 10 minutes. Maybe I should start practicing and enter a donut eating contest. Hmmm, I might be on to something here....",

We were in a hurry, there was no line luckily at 6pm on a Friday.  The donuts were made fresh and quickly!   I like my donuts simple, so I ordered Cinnamon Sugar and Glazed.  Both were perfection!!!!!!  And I mean I'll be dreaming about them until I am able to go back.  Warm, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness.   The service at the shop was prompt & friendly.

Duck Doughnuts specializes in cake doughnuts which gives them a more denser doughnut, making them perfect for adding loads of toppings vs Krispy Kreme's melt in your mouth that are better(in my opinion )simply glazed.   When I walked in I was greeted by the owner and staff and after explaining it was my first time, the owner who was working the register went over the doughnuts themselves as well as how to order. If you plan on ordering a really mixed assortment it's probably better (as well as more polite if it crowded) to grab a order sheet near the door and enter in the doughnuts that way to expedite the process. I ended up going with an assortment that included my bf's fav, the maple icing topped with bacon and my fav the lemon icing with coconut chips.   When I arrived home I added some candles around them and presented my bf with Ducks doughnuts for his bday since neither of us really do cake! Perfect for any occasion and simply delicious!",

Funny thing is, I normally don't like donuts nor sweets at all & for me to rave about this place is saying a lot.  (I'm sitting here kind of knockin' myself for being so crazy over them but yeah, I am a fan!)   I got to try them for the first time a couple months ago and luckily, I went on a Sunday afternoon around 1-2pm so they weren't super busy. I was a little lost and confused when I got there but the African American lady cashier there was SO NICE and SO SO FRIENDLY.  She helped me choose and picked all different & random combination to create these goodies! Even I was a little afraid of taking up too much time in line deciding whats not but she did not care at all nor seems annoyed.  In fact, she won't even let me apologized about it! That's what you called stellar customer service! I love that you get to choose whatever you want and they're not even that expensive!  I also liked that I can watch them put the donuts together! Kinda cool of an assembly.  However, my first bite of their popular Bacon topped with Maple glaze was truly truly amazinnnngggg.  It was warm, soft, a little crispy with a slight salty and sweet combo together, oh my gosh, soo soooo good. It felt like heaven biting into it! If you waited and eat it later and re-heated it up in the microwave, it's not the same. Definitely better if you could just eat it right there at the store when you first brought it. I loved it so much my first time, I kept thinking about it. I even came back for seconds a few weeks later but was a little disappointed the cashier lady that I liked wasn't working.  The guy who took my order was just basic, simple.  Didn't really offer much help or cared, just doing his job and getting my order done. Was a little bummed but still, the donuts were bomb-diggity! Literally, made me happy again after biting into it.   Don't go first thing in the morning, I heard there's a long line out the door! There really isn't much seating inside either so it's really a drop in and out the door kind of place but service was quick unless it's during busy hours.",

Duck Donuts definitely satisfied my craving, and I would rate the donuts at a solid \"good\".  Here's the scoop:  The Draw:  You walk in and you can literally see the donut machine making the donuts.  You can also fully customize your donuts.  You want Bacon with Chocolate frosting?  Done.  You want orange glaze with rainbow sprinkles?  Done.  Best part is that someone else gets to make the mess creating your donuts and you get to eat them.  Win...Win.  When to go:  The weekdays.  I stopped in here a little after lunchtime and there were only two people in line.  Based on what I read about the weekend lines, I think I'll avoid this place on a Sat/Sun.  What to order:  The Seasonal and Daily Donuts.  Yeah, ok they have sprinkles and bacon and all that fun stuff, but why not order what interesting creation they come up with!  I got the French Toast and Pumpkin Spice donuts.  Pumpkin was the winner.  Why I would go again:  For selfish reasons, I love that I can make whatever donut I want and get creative without actually doing the work.  This is also a great concept for anyone looking to create a personalized gift, thoughtful gift for someone with all of their favorite toppings...even if that someone is yourself!",

She said she wanted something sweet, so I did a quick yelp search and Duck Donuts popped up. I told her everyone kept raving about it so why not give it a shot. I am so very glad I did!! I got their cinnamon toast crunch donut and a chocolate dipped donut to take back for my brother, along with their holiday blend coffee. Everything was amazing, and the best part is the donuts are cooked to order. Nothing beats a hot fresh donut, it's the very reason people make a run on Krispy Creme when the hot sign comes on. Here at Duck Donuts you get that with every order... it's what I imagine heaven is like!! I was so impressed with them that I decided for International Women's Day I would bring in Duck Donuts for the morning session at work instead of Dunkin (Dunkin is right next to my office). I was able to pre-order, and schedule it for an early enough time that I didn't have to fight traffic. I arrived a little early, and they went ahead and got my ordered cooked, and even loaded them and the coffee into my car for me. FYI if Duck Donuts ever decides to add delivery to their business plan someone in my office would order daily... we'll all be roly poly but we'd be happy haha.   The donuts are delicious, and the service is amazing, so I encourage everyone to give them a shot.",

French Toast is my fav...wife loves the Reese's.  My wife was pretty disappointed there was no milk in the cooler...she would take off a star for that since she's not a coffee person.    For $1.20 for a fresh donut MTO with any frosting and topping you want--can't beat it!",

They don't have any donuts with filling inside, they just sprinkle things on top, which for me is a minus. Their cinnamon donuts were nothing to write home about. Pretty common taste wise. Customer service wasn't particularly good, the clerk we got wasn't very pleasant, the girls that were preparing our order were talking to each other the whole time. The parking lot was pretty crowded. But what it matters to me most is the taste, the flavor of the donuts which were pretty generic and not distinctive.",

So the shop is nice, efficient, and friendly. The menu is promising, with lots of option for any tastebuds. I got the maple bacon, which is a shop fav and a few other classic flavors like glazed and cinnamon sugar. My consensus is they are good not great by any stretch. To put it simply, they are overrated. That's just my opinion, if someone brought me one I'd eat it, but I would not go out of my way to purchase any. I guess with all the rave, it's just a matter of preference.",

The doughnuts are warm, soft and slightly 'cakey' ( it's not a word, but you get my meaning). THEN, there are several coatings and toppings you can choose . Yes, yes it's True, they do made to order donuts. So there is what makes them unique from other donut spots. They also have 12 suggested combinations they can make for you, but it's all made fresh , you can see them making them. This is definitely a must-visit place in Charlotte. They also have a location opening in Huntersville NC soon ( Spring 2017) and locations in other states. The coffee is also reasonably priced and delicious. Not a lot of seating , but still worth the visit.",

It was similar to an assembly line how they prepped them for you. They were made fresh to order and you could watch the employees making them which I thought was pretty cool. And for how many people were there, it was packed, they were going to the line pretty quick! The one thing that did catch my eye in a negative way was that the girl who took my order at the cash register was texting in between customers which was holding up the line longer than it needed to be. Other than that, all the employees were super nice and attentive.  Now to the good part! The donuts were delicious, they literally just melted in your mouth. I don't think I've ever had a cake a donut before but it's now my favorite go to treat! We got the maple glaze with bacon, the cinnamon bun (the daily special), and a glazed with rainbow sprinkles. We could not get these donuts down fast enough!! They had sooo many different toppings and glazes, I didn't know what to do! The ones we had were awesome though. I can't wait to go back and try some different mixes!",

You need to wait a while, but that's because the donuts are made to order.  I ordered a dozen to try out some flavors and to share, and a coffee since you can check in on yelp and get a free coffee!   Something happened with my ticket and I ended up waiting around for 15-20 minutes. At first, because this was my first time, I thought it just took THAT long. But I kept seeing people leave with their donuts before me. I asked the girl about it, and she didn't have my ticket at all. They were very apologetic and worked on them right away.  The donuts were tasty, but they are cake batter donuts, so they get a little heavy after attempting to eat more than one at a time. I think it's a wonderful shop and a great idea to have so many customizable options. I don't think I'd make a special trip down here, but I'd definitely have them again!",

    "text": "During the Christmas break, we went to Duck Donuts for an outing and our first visit.  I ordered the donut (one kind, no chocolate) with peanut butter glaze and a coconut topping.  It came warm and was very delicious, I must say.  Why three stars then?  I think this place could have been SO much better.    After going to Voodoo Donuts in Portland a couple years ago, everything else is pretty disappointing.  Apparently, they're kind of a mecca for donut lovers.  The consistent line out the door and down the street was a definite indication.  Why?  First, their donuts are huge.  Duck Donuts' are regular-sized.  Second, there are endless combinations of unique flavors.  Duck Donuts has only a handful.  You can pick out one glaze and one topping.  That's it, no more.  No, you can't have both peanuts AND sprinkles; are you crazy?  And where are Oreos?  Donuts and Oreos were made for each other.  Third, at Duck Donuts, you create your own.  While the warm donut part is nice, there aren't all of these magically created donuts already made for you to gawk and drool over.  I had a tough time deciding which donut to pick at Voodoo Donuts.  At Duck, it wasn't that hard given the very limited options.    Lastly, there are about three two-seater tables in the whole restaurant.  That's it.   We had to stand around to eat our very sticky donuts (and then rush to the bathroom to wash our hands).  There's a huge wasted space in the middle of the store that could easily be filled with a lot more tables, if rearranged better.    Anyway, while I really enjoyed the donut I tried, I'm not jumping on the Duck Donuts bandwagon and making it a regular thing when I know there are so many things they could do to make it a truly magical experience.",

The cool thing about these donuts is that they are custom made. There are topping combinations that DD has come up with, such as Maple Bacon. DD also has a Donut of the Day. However, there is no discount and you can order any of these any day of the week.  I guess it's a way to get people to try something new. I personally like the Maple Bacon, which has glaze and bacon on it. The bacon is a nice compliment to the sweet on sweet donut. Donuts are only $1.20. I cannot overstate how good these donuts are. They are not overrated and you have to try it to understand the greatness that lies within.   Being able to watch the donuts being made, this is also a place that kids seem to like. They get to watch the donut making process from start to finish, as they are fried fresh by the minute. The service here is great, as they seem accustomed to people asking several questions about how this process works. I'm sure it'll take awhile before not many people are new. DD also has various merchandise for sale, such as rubber ducks, shirts, etc. There isn't much space to sit down, so you don't want to come with a large group. Nevertheless, if you're lucky, there may be space for two. There are also two small table outside. I saw several people sitting on the sidewalk eating their donuts. If you haven't been to Duck Donuts, stop what you're doing Right Now and thank me later.",

I went out of my way to get these donuts for my operations guys while visiting--they are from Charlotte and had never had them. They will now be customers. These are so fun--they have SO many flavors. I would recommend the pumpkin and cinnamon and sugar. The donuts come out hot, so if you are transporting far make sure to get one to eat on the way so you can enjoy the hot melt in your mouth experience.   They also offer coffee with a free re-fill--however, I did not get this so I cannot attest to if this was truck stop coffee or local coffee. There is not much seating in this place so I would plan to take them to-go. There was bar seating but it was only 5 seats (I think) and was full when I was there.   For me, this place ranks top of the donut places I have ever been to. I wish there was one in my home town.",

The donuts are all the same: traditional cake donuts. You can pick your frosting/glaze, and then any addition toppings they offer. Everything is MTO so you know it's gonna be fresh! And with the endless options, you're gonna want to get at least a 1/2 dozen to try a bunch.   My favorites so far: maple bacon glaze with bacon crumble, orange glaze & vanilla frosted costing in cinnamon & sugar.   I was very excited for the strawberry frosting, but was disappointed in the end. It was good, but not nearly the strawberry flavor that I was anticipating/hoping for.   Peanut butter loves will love to peanut butter frosting with a chocolate drizzle and chocolate sprinkles",

We walked over in Dilworth and were met with delicious aromas and friendly cashiers to help us through the decadent process.  Donuts are homemade (you can watch) and there are many batter flavors as well as icing swirls dunks toppings etc. There are even seasonal options. Our donuts were warm and fresh. The thing I was most surprised about was the price. I expected it to be overpriced and a treat, but it was reasonable. Two donuts and two coffees for about $7 bucks.   I would definitely recommend if you like rich and sweet breakfast! :)",

The donuts are fresh and customized to order so be prepared to wait a bit, not only in line to order but also while they make it. The wait is worth it though. The donut is warm, chewy, and cakey, but also airy so it's not dense. The base is the same; it's the coating, toppings, and drizzle that make the donut pop. My brother had his go-to maple bacon donut. The bacon is real and generously sprinkled on top of a maple iced donut. I tried the chocolate icing with chocolate sprinkles and the salted caramel drizzle - it was very good! The combinations are endless and I can't wait to try another one soon.",

We brought a half dozen since it was only $1 more than getting 4 donuts. We tried a Glaze, Orange Glaze, Strawberry and Lemon Glaze. The orange glaze had the best taste.  Basically all the donuts taste the same as they are all the same recipe and only the way they are topped (glazed) is what make them a different flavor. We are not the biggest fan of them and only headed there because we were in the area and I noticed a friend check-in on FB there with a picture of the orange glaze and it looked  yummy so we stopped in just in the nic of time as they were closing at 3 and we arrived at 2:54pm on a Sunday.  The place was pretty packed as they are well known and well liked. There were also a lot of people showing up and having to be turned around because the place closed and they were done making donuts for the day.  Overall, I wouldn't make the drive to have a donut from here and would however have ONE just ONE (as they are pretty thick and fatting I'm sure) if I was in the area and in the need of a sweet fix.",

Even though I was tempted to get a half dozen, we walked away with a simple two donuts today. The bf ordered the bare (surprisingly good for being a plain, unglazed donut) and a maple with chopped peanuts. It's $1.20 per single donut. The box came out hot, almost too hot to hold. But YUM, so fresh and not oily at all. The glazes are extremely sweet, I'd hold off on icing if you have sensitive teeth.   We will be back for more...hopefully before or after the gym so I don't feel too guilty. Cheers!",

They use bacon crumbles which makes the bacon ratio more even for each bite compared to a place that shall remain nameless that uses full strips of bacon and serves their donuts in a pink box. They may have created it but Duck donuts perfected it.   I also like that they offer seasonal options like the current mint frost or drizzle. Parking can be difficult if you come during peak dining times as the share a parking lot with two great restaurants and a froyo place. You may have to park in the teeter parking lot but the walk is worth it.",

No one comes and gets a dozen donuts at 6:30 am who isn't headed somewhere. If they could be more focused on getting people in and out, they'd easily be 5 stars.

I feel what makes these donuts attractive is they are pretty much hot each time you order so no waiting for that \"hot now sign\" . I'm not a huge fan of the instantly fried cake donut, it wasn't bad, just a little crunchy on the outside. The icing and toppings are coated on by hand after they are dropped off the belt for each order which was cool, I just wish there was an assortment of dough and toppings.   My reason for giving duck donuts three stars is because there aren't many options, but like I said earlier it is a good spot if you love vanilla cake donuts .  So , if I have someone ask where can I get a yummy cake donut ... Exit stage right to duck donuts , that's all folks .",

    "text": "I'd never been here before and had no idea about the make-your-own-and-get-it-fresh thing. I got a coffee and one donut for a total of $4.01. (The donut is $1.30 which is ridiculous even for made fresh and customizable.)  After paying, I saw a sign for a coffee and two donuts, $4.25. I asked if I could get that deal. They asked a manager and said the manager said no.  Why? You can't just say no. At its most elaborate, you have to do a refund and a resell, and it's a bummer sure but you don't refuse someone a gorram refund.  I really needed that second donut too. I'd chosen one of their suggested vanilla drizzle, and it really didn't lend itself to being drizzled hot. Got all melty and unpleasant.  I want to but I can never go back now that I feel they owe me and suck. XP",

The process is simple - you order and pay at the counter, and then pick up your freshly dipped doughnuts at the end of the line.  The process is faster and easier than you would think, and their prices are very reasonable, too.  My only complaint?  Their early closing hours.  Why aren't they open later on weekends to accommodate those who'd love a doughnut for dessert after dinner?  Since they close so early at 7pm on Saturdays, that makes it quite difficult.  I'd visit more, if they would extend their hours!",

The donuts are fresh (you can watch them make it which is fun) and customized to order so you always get a warm and fresh donut.The Maple + Bacon + Salted Caramel is one of the favorites, and for a good reason. Especially warm, it is melt in your mouth worthy. However, I've had over types of donuts and I haven't had one that I haven't enjoyed. There is a large variety of glazes, toppings, and drizzles to meet your needs, both for fruity, salty, and sweet. They also have a daily special (I've seen orange dreamsicle recently) as well as a glaze of the month so you can try something new.  There isn't a lot of seating (2 tables outside and a tabletop inside) so you may need to eat in your car or find another spot in the parking lot to sit. The wait, depending on the time of day, can be out the door, but typically later in the day is a little more reasonable.  You should definitely make Duck Donuts part of your weekend craze, you won't be disappointed!",

Simple and sweet. For 1.20, this is a great little treat! Also, if you heat up the donuts as the box recommends it's heavenly. The staff is friendly, the donuts are fresh and the line is quick.

The doughnuts are so soft and airy, it is like nothing I ever tasted.  They make the doughnuts to order so you aren't picking from a display case.

I got three with mountains  of sugar on all of the donuts and in the box (looked like a cat litter box).  I said I ordered 4, and only with light sugar on the top.  With an attitude the woman took back the box. She took the three donuts and shook them into the current box that I was given, with the gobs of sugar already in the box.  So now I have donuts with sugar on the top and bottom.  I said to the lady I only want a light sprinkle on the top only with 4 donuts, not 3.  Not only did I get an attitude, I got the stare of how dare you ask me to fix you something the way you asked for/ paid for.  As I said the donuts are amazing, the service needs to be worked on.  I will give them another chance, but would definetly stop coming if this type of service continues.",

Not only can you pick your own glazes and toppings, but the actual donut is like nothing I've ever tasted. The donuts are literally melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you're looking for a sweet treat, you have to try Duck Donuts!!",

I'll probably just get the drizzle next time because it was so good.   You can get it as sweet (or not as sweet) as you want.  The kiddos loved watching and the line was out the door.  It'll be our regular after church stop!",

They were a little more \"dense\" than a traditional donut, but I think that's what I liked most about it!  They have a maple bacon donut, which is unexpectedly tasty.  Definitely worth a visit!",

The bacon is probably the best on any donut in town. The cinnamon sugar donut is amazing. I'm only giving it a 4 because they've got a competitor down the road that is through the roof. However, this is in a great location, family friendly, and they provide quick service. I get overwhelmed standing in line trying to figure out what we will do",

I realize we were trying to get in at the last minute but, if you say you're open till 7, be open till 7.  Disappointed to be turned away.  I worked retail for a number of years and we never shut the door before the big hand was at the 12, no matter how much we wanted to.",

If you have young children they will love to watch the donut machine drop the dough into the oil at one end and come out the other end cooked and ready for the topping of your choice. I want one of those machines in my kitchen. I loved the powdered sugar and the cinnamon sugar donuts of my youth but they also have all the popular new/strange toppings that are currently popular. Go and enjoy a real donut.",
