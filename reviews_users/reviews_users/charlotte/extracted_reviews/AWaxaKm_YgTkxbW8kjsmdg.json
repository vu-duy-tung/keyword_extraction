This BBQ isn't as good as you'll find in some of the NC Mountain towns (Woodlands) but it's better than everything else in Charlotte.   My main question is, why no waiters? Ordering food here is challenging and confusing. You order from the bar computer and find a seat. This restaurant needs waiters, it's not setup to order food and find a place to sit.   Secondly I ordered a catering pack for \"5 or 6\" people and we got banana pudding as one of the sides. They only gave us 4 small cups and said 5 or 6 on the website is just an estimate and the banana pudding didn't come in catering sizes. Well I was feeding 6 people, that's why I ordered it, so I had to order 2 extra ones separately, they should have just given them to me.   We've been here quite a few times but sitting and eating is not a good experience. The food however is excellent.",

Enough about me...I have been to Moe's on three occasions and feel this guys do a decent job with their Q.  They do pulled pork, smoked turkey, chicken, brisket and ribs.  The side are very good and sometimes a little over creative.  The mac and cheese could use some help but the sweet potatoes and greens are very good along with a few others.  These guys know their stuff and smoke their meat using fruit wood or a combination of with hickory.  I would rate this guys above the joints uptown Charlotte and a little better than Macs on south blvd  The portions are a good size, for example a meat with two sides and a drink is $10.00 for a platter. You can add another meat for $3.00.  The beer selection is not bad either.  Give this place a try, you won't regret it one bit....Keep on Smok'n",

For those of us from other places, with an appreciation for different types of BBQ, this place is fantastic!  The sides are the best.  I've had the baked beans, collards, sweet potato casserole, mac and cheese and its all delicious.   The BBQ is even better. Its got just the right amount of smokey flavor without that overpowering vinegar taste you get from most BBQ in this town.  The BBQ sauce is great too.  Service is extremely friendly and its just a comfortable place to hang out and have a meal.  Plus the prices are pretty good and the servings really fill you up. If you want some fantastic BBQ this is the place to go!",

Most BBQ places are order-at-the-counter, eat off of paper plates and baskets. (The great ones anyway.) Not ever gonna' throw down cuz a BBQ or Chicken place doesn't behave like a sit-down restaurant. Don't even care if they don't have tables. These places concentrate on one thing: Food. And my friends, Moe's has got that food part down-pat! It's dayamn good!!! You can tell all the sides were cooked with \"love\" (butter & pork fat) and you won't care. So so so SO super yummy! I had Mac & Chz that was perfection and my friend had some squash casserole that was so good she couldn't stop making yummy noises. And this is the 1st establishment that I've found that actually rivals my collards. That is no small feat. (I make some mean collards.) And the BBQ?? AMAZING. Tender and sweet and tangy! YummO! Well done!! Will definitely be back. Again and again. Wanna' try EVERYTHING!!!",

The pulled pork was moist and had a good flavor, not the best ever, but good. The sauces were tasty, but not traditional NC vinegar based. The sides were ok. The Mac and cheese were good, the beans were better. Overall, I would give the food 4 stars.  The -'s ... Portion size and price. You can tell it's a franchise when the food comes. Not your typical BBQ joint large tray. The pork was about as much as you would get in a good sandwich and the sides came in small cups like some places use for ketchup, well a little bigger maybe. For $10 and change, not a lot of food. Oh, yea, I wanted to try the brisket, but they only make it 2 days a week? What's up with that?  So if you need a Q fix, it'll do, but expect to pay for your jones!",

Their way does not beat our way , but its just as good. Moe's features some really good pork barbeque, smoked chicken , turkey, and outstanding fried catfish . The catfish is a select, delicious lightly fried, crispy bit of goodness. Don't miss it. The smoked chicken is also one of my favorites, though as a True Carolinian, I will bring it home and cook it another 30 minutes . I like my bird to fall apart when I pick up the fork. The sides will vary from day to day, which is a really good thing. Lots of options ranging from squash casserole, mac n cheese, collards, succotash, beans of all persuasions, and their signature Mud Pie dessert.  We have returned to Moe's 8 times since they opened a month ago. Don't miss this place !!! I particularly like the fact that the meals include a drink. My only knock is that their tends to be a little too much portion control(especially with the sides) for a True Southern downhome style eating establishment... and we do not call it a \"po boy\" if its in a small hamburger bun. We call that a slider...",

The one poor girl who is up front has ALL the responsibility of service. She's (whoever it shall be any day) has the responsibility of taking the order of all the food for everyone walking in the door right at the counter (which you're supposed to tip before you're even served your food). She's also the bartender at the decent sized bar pouring all the drinks herself. She's also the server that has to go to the kitchen and get the food and bring it out to your table vacating her other positions. Today I witnessed a manager, I'm assuming, smart mouthed his employee because she had to do all these other tasks while he had to explain the awkward ordering, seating, and food ordering situation to customers that standing around looking confused. The manager obviously is very proud of his food, which, no doubt, is great. But until the setup of this place is organized better I think I'll grab my food elsewhere because I hate to see employees talked down to that are doing 3 times the jobs as the manager who's walking around with his pride in tact.",

He explained the menu and how to order at the counter. With decisions to be made while standing, it felt slightly overwelming, however he was very patient with us. I tried the wings and a couple of ribs. I was taken back when he said there were no sauce choices for wings, but that they were smoked and he assured me that they are great with the flavor that comes with it, slight hot and slight sweet. He was right, they tasted great. The ribs were good but overcooked as they were too tender. Atmosphere was comfortable and our service was friendly and fast Will return.",

    "text": "this was my 4th  visit to Moe's.  I originally learned of this restaurant via a birthday party I attended where their wings were served.  I have tried whole chicken, wings, pulled pork and catfish.  On my first three visits, I ordered and came in to pick up and go.  Let me say..the chicken is absolutely the best ever. However, customer service is horrendous.  When visiting each time as a carry out customer, I was never treated warmly nor acknowledged.  I figured they are busy and the service must be better as a dine in customer.  NOT.  I came in for lunch with my husband just today.  No one was at the front. After a minute or so, a young man appeared and queried if we had dined here before.  I advised we had but as carry out. He looked at me with a blank stare and said \"whenever you are ready.\" Assuming this was our signal to order, we ordered and seated ourselves.  Our food was prepared and brought out in reasonable time, the food was cooked well, he temperature was good and portions reasonable.  During our meal, no one and I mean no one checked in on us. After we finished eating, my husband and I continued to talk and was approached by an employee inquiring if we were finished, so she could take our plates. Both my husband and I noted the service, finished our conversation and used the restroom before leaving.  The restrooms were in decent order.  Kinda felt as if we were not welcomed. As we exited, the young man attending the bar with no customers, said nothing.  The young lady who cleared our plates yelled \"thank you and have a great day!\" Customer service is huge to me. So huge that your food could be outstanding but your service is poor and I would never return.  Well that is the case here.  Our family will never spend coin here again.  Great food but just about THE WORST service I have experienced in a long while.",

    "text": "I was offered a chance to review this restaurant for my blog. This restaurant is a gem that I may have overlooked otherwise!  I usually check out the menu of any new restaurant I visit online before heading over. So when I saw the menu below on their website I was pretty underwhelmed. Even though I wasn't excited about the menu I was very excited about the restaurant's location. The restaurants location is a bright, open space on a main street the the quaint, downtown Matthews area with a great outdoor seating area.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted a chalkboard listing the side specials of the day. My husband and I were both excited to see these extra options. I am the picky eater of the two of us, and my husband would have been all over the collards and creamed spinach if it wasn't for me.  After a not so quick conversation to decide what entrees and sides we wanted we walked up to the counter to order. Ultimately we ended up with 2 entrees, 4 sides and an add-on of wings to each entree.  While my husband picked out our seats while I checked out the rest of the space. I was excited to learn that there are 12 local and regional beers on tap, including one of B's local favorites, Triple C.  The food was brought to our table and looked amazing. Any hesitations I originally had about what I thought was a limited menu were totally gone. One plate included: pulled pork with sauce, jalapeno cornbread, skillet corn, Brunswick stew, and smoked wings. The other included: shrimp \"Moe\" boy, squash casserole, mac 'n cheese, and smoked wings.  Simply said, the food was delicious, some more so then others. Although everything we tried was flavorful, the skillet corn and Brunswick stew were overshadowed by the other items on our plates.  The two items that I was most impressed with and surprised by was the shrimp \"Moe\" boy and the smoked wings.  I am a huge fan of shrimp po boys thanks to B's family. Although this one was different than many po boys that I have had, B and I agree that it was one of the best. We are used to po boys served on French bread with tartar sauce, lettuce and tomato while Moe's serves theirs on a hamburger bun with their marinated slaw and what appeared to be a house sauce.  The smoked wings were also impressive. I rarely go outside my box with smoked foods. I usually limit myself to smoked pork. I just don't like the smoky, wood flavor in my food (same with oaky wines, not my fave), especially poultry; but when the cashier recommended the wings I decided to branch out and give them a try and I am so glad a did. They had all of the flavor you look for in a wing without all of the saucy mess. They came with celery and what I think was BBQ ranch, however they were so fantastic on their own that I never even opened the sauce. After a conversation with the chef I learned that they are brined, smoked, and then flash fried. Amazing.  The only reason there was anything left on the plate was because the portions were so generous!  If you like BBQ (or even if you don't) add Moe's to your list to try. You won't be disappointed.",

They have different specials each day: Monday is Mahi Mahi Sandwich, Tuesdays and Fridays is Beef Brisket, Wednesday is Southern Fried Chicken and Thursday is Thanksgiving Day Sandwiches. Everything is amazing. The best thing I've had is the Pulled Pork Egg Rolls. They don't have it on the regular menu so it's a real treat when they have it on the board. To top it off, they have awesome craft beer selection- 12 taps and great can/bottle selection. I eat here at least once a week!",

Service was half committed to something else but not me, the customer.  The worst part about this kind of food and service is that the owner knows what is going on and is deliberately putting out bad product with a who-give-a-hoot attitude.",

DFH 90 minute Foothills Jade Olde Hickory Imperial Stout Founders Porter NoDa Hop, Drop 'n Roll NoDa Gordgeous Birdsong and a few more I can't recall.  The food is awesome!! Love the BBQ but the fried chicken on Wednesday is really good, and the shrimp \"Mo boy\" sandwich is incredible! (had it twice this week) Their sides are all fresh homemade with some being everyday and some daily specials. All have been GREAT so far with the succotash and jalapeno cheese grits being my favorite so far! My wife got the sweat potato casserole as a dessert and it too was amazing...topped with toasted corn flakes I think the only thing it needed was a little whip cream!!! The only disappointment so far has been the banana pudding...it has no bananas.  On our first visit we sorta gripped about the serving sizes of the sides, but for $10 you get a sandwich, 2 sides, and a drink and we have not left hungry. The building is nice with roll up bay doors, screens, and 2 outdoor patios.",

I was in the area so I decided to make a trip there. I picked up a large rib platter to go with corn bread and mac n' cheese and banana pudding as my sides. They didn't put excessive amounts of sauce on the ribs but provided an extra container of sauce, which I prefer. I'm also not a big melted cheese fan, but their mac n' cheese has the perfect amount of cheese. And the banana pudding was great too. I don't live super close to Moe's, but it was definitely worth the trip. I'll be back and will recommend to others!",

The quality of barbecue is highly disappointing for something that is being served in NC. The BBQ isn't smoky and the sauce is bland. The amount of meat we got (pork) was shabby. The sides are really small and I think the size of a large Jell-O shot is accurate. The cobbler was disappointing as were the baked beans. The red beans and rice were yucky. The Mac and cheese was ok. The cornbread was eh. I wouldn't go back. There are way better BBQ places all over the Charlotte metro area.",

We love trying new places but there are some that stand out and Moe's tops our list.    You walk in and know that you are about to have an amazing meal.  The smell of real wood pit smoked BBQ greets you.  The cool, relaxed vibe with the garage doors and outside seating calms you.  The board with all of the specials of the day is always on point!  This is not your typical BBQ joint with plain old mac and cheese and baked beans.  They have all of the things you want and love but each of them have their own unique twist.  Everything is innovative and  made in house.  There is always something new and delicious to try.  We have been here so many times and have never once been disappointed .  Try the wings!  But I will warn you...it might ruin wings for you forever anywhere else!  They have a small but good selection of beer on tap which is great also.    All around this is our favorite place to go.

The biggest surprise was that the service was exceptional, they were so nice and patient with us, and they had one of the best CRAFT BEER selections in the area.  We may have had a lot of questions, but they helped us out on everything, and check in on us.  We will definitely be back.",

The cole slaw was of the vinegar variety which I usually don't like but was crunchy and sweet with mustard seeds throughout. Very good! My other side was potato salad that was tasty but was 1/2 frozen! (how so they do that or not realize that before they serve it).  My husband had  the catfish sandwich that he loved, topped with pickles and slaw. Lots of unique local beers and a full bar.   Wait staff was not overly friendly and one of the waitress was huffy. Oh well-the bartender was nice. They had all the SEC games on the multiple tv's.   Casual dress, good food, plentiful portions, and average prices. We will go here again when we are in downtown Matthews and looking for BBQ.",

The slaw was slightly sweet and crunchy with hand shredded cabbage. In my opinion a perfect combination. The baked beans were perfectly cooked, slightly sweet with a hint of pepper and you could still tell you where eating beans and not mash! Mac-n-cheese appears to have white cheddar giving it a light cheesy taste not too heavy. Yum! We chose the pulled pork BBQ with a sweet sauce. The pork was cooked to perfection with just enough 'juice' to keep it from being dry and just enough sauce to enhance the already delicious taste of fresh cooked BBQ. These guys don't play! They know their BBQ!!!  Every dish above leans to the sweet side of BBQ and is delicious!!! Already making plans to go back!",

The cornbread was dry, tasted freezer burnt and cold too...Have been to most bbq places around here by now, Moe's in Asheville is by far the best. Everything is fresh, hot and flavored perfectly.  With the exception of maybe Midwood, we are done wasting our money on bbq..I don't get all of the rave reviews over some of these mediocre bbq places. Dry food isn't ok. Bland food isn't normal. Will bbq at home until I get back to Asheville. Best coleslaw ever there too. No complaints about them at all, they do it right and they are the only place that seems to have really high standards and it shows. I cannot tell you how many places the pork is dry and the beans could've come out of a can...MOES in Asheville,  trust me!",

    "text": "STRANGE place, unique form of BBQ (I'd consider myself well traveled) and know HOW MANY differences BBQ has across our Nation. First: The set up is quite different...you leave your order at the 'bar'/check out/cashier. That same person is also the waiter, bartender, cashier and when the place is busy...well it is confusing then.  Second:The food~quite pricey for a BBQ joint. I had a wing plate for $11. (to go) this time. The wings were big, cooked well, but no visable BBQ sauce on them. I'm not sure, but there was a teeny cup of something white that might have been some ranchy dsg, but I don't like ranch so I didn't try it. With the platter I chose side of slaw. Sides are also in the same teeny portions as the sauce (I'm disappointed). There was a LARGE brick style piece of cornbread, but the texture was not your usual cornbread density, but more like a sponge and on the dry, tastless side. I think there were jalapenos in it but it was too dry to care about. Unique slaw...with more than enough green pepper & strings of red onion throughout it. It really wasn't a vinegary slaw and absolutely wasn't mayo-based either...their own style I suppose.  Lastly: Their location is right on the main drag in Matthews. BUT where it is situated you can't park at the restaurant, you park in a lot or on the street and walk to the place. NO drive thru available at all, either. I cannot say the food was bad, just not like ANY other BBQ I have ever eaten in any state. For the $$ and the odd way to order/wait...I won't be back any time soon. The young man running the whole show was polite and nice enough, I just think he needs some helpers AND/OR they need a different way to handle busy times.",

We make Friday visits a routine as they make brisket only on Tuesdays and Fridays. Apparently brisket takes a lot of time and they do it only twice a week to make sure they do it right. We have sampled everything on the regular side menu and it's all delicious. The sweet potato casserole, the jalapeno cheese grits, red beans and rice, potato salad and collards are to die for. The least of our favorites on the regular side menu are the mac and cheese and the banana pudding. Everyday they offer different specials. The redneck nachos are a must, I had a Thanksgiving type turkey sandwich with cranberries, gravy, dressing that was literally one of the best things I have ever eaten. The southern fried catfish and the shrimp moe boy are incredible!!! If they are serving their peanut butter pie, you better go early because it goes fast.  Unbelievable craft beer selection on tap. Great price, delicious food and awesome people! We love to start the evening with a craft beer at Carolina Beer Temple and walk down for dinner at Moe's.",

The aroma is amazing the smokey smell of roasting meat fills the air and you can smell it even before opening the front door.  On top of all of this they have a great beer selection, the draught list included local gems like OMB, Mother Earth, and Highlands.  I'm very excited about this place for the rest of summer, and while craft beer prices did seem to be a little pricey, the food is cheap enough to balance it out.  Can't wait to go back",

It was so good that I ordered it on the 2nd visit, too.  It has big pieces of flavorful smoked turkey.   Get it \"'Bama Style\" and they'll smother it in sauce.  My 3rd visit, I ordered the Fried Shrimp Moe Boy.  I naturally assumed it would be their version of a Po Boy on a long hoagie bun, but I was wrong.   It's more like a shrimp sandwich than a Po Boy.  It was on a hamburger bun with a few scattered shrimp.  It was just okay, and I wouldn't order it again.  I'll stick to their BBQ sandwiches or platters from now on.  Along with the sandwiches, you get not one, but two side item choices, and there's a good variety of choices -- cold items, hot items, and even desserts.  My favorite side items so far have been the side salad and mac & cheese.  The side items are served in little plastic cups which make them look really tiny on your plate.  If you dump them out, though, there's really quite a lot in there, and I think Moe's is doing themselves a disservice with this deceptive appearance.    I'd also like to note that when I ordered the above Fried Shrimp Moe Boy, it looked like there were tiny hairs throughout my sandwich.  It looked pretty gross.  I questioned this with one of the workers and they looked into it.  Apparently, fried corn cobs was one of the sides of the day and the corn silk was getting into the fryer, getting singed so it looked like human hair, and then attached itself to my fried shrimp.  It was an acceptable excuse, and I ate the sandwich, but its appearance throughout my shrimp sandwich made me enjoy the fake Po Boy even less.  Note to Moe's: don't fry corn cobs with your other foods.  I can't be the only person who thought there was human hair in my food.  And, corn silk or not, it's not very appetizing in appearance.  Moe's has ample seating inside, with garage door windows that can be opened, depending on the weather.  I recommend a visit for a quick, tasty, filling BBQ meal.",

    "text": "We recently moved to the Mint Hill/Matthews area.  I am always looking for vegan friendly restaurants that offer something for my meat eating husband and something for me. Moe's Original Bar B Que offers only one vegan option, but it is a good one.  The Smoked Tofu Sandwich can be made vegan by eliminating the white sauce. A tofu sandwich should not default to a dairy based sauce. I always have to remember to tell them to nix the white sauce. They have plenty of bbq  based sauces that are very good. The sandwich with the two sides is plentiful. The only regular vegan side is the bbq slaw which is sweet/sour and very good.  There are daily special sides which are indeed very special.  There is usually one daily side that is vegan.  Ask the chefs, in the back, which specials are vegan. The servers taking the order don't seem to know what vegan or plant/based mean.  This may sound crazy but I would love to see more vegan options at this bbq restaurant. BBQ jackfruit and some more special sides would be amazing.  More people are looking for plant-based options.  I vote for something for everyone.",

My husband enjoyed his Mac and cheese but especially enjoyed the corn bread. I absolutely loved my food too.   My only concern is no printed allergy menu, but to the cashier listened and knew what had been prepared with eggs and able to make suggestions of foods to avoid or to try.  Still not a fan of Carolina style bbq sauce, but next time I will bring along a bottle of sweet baby rays.",

The bartender was friendly and they had a good selection of drafts (including some charlotte brews). There are also tables outside on the patio.  They have your usual bbq meats available in sandwich form or platter form, and they come with 2 sides. I had the smoked chicken sandwich with gumbo and a side salad. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with side salad and mac & cheese. The sandwiches can be served \"Bama\" style - red sauce, white sauce and slaw or plain. All the food was solid, not life changing, but really good. My personal preference is smokier flavor, I really didn't notice the smoky smoky goodness in my chicken, so I would kick that up a little.   Overall, we liked it and would definitely go back for lunch when in the mood for some good Q!",

They're usually out of a few sides and they're just okay. I do like the sweet potato casserole. The meats are very hit or miss, as is the temperature of the meat. Sometimes they're fantastic, other times I wonder if I'm eating the last of the day (at noon).   I've been around 8 times with my family so I think it's a pretty fair review. The service is okay but the way the place is set up leads to long lines at the register. Also, you clean up after yourself, which is usually fine - but I think it's a little pricey to be so casual.",

    "text": "A friend brought me here for lunch for the first time today. It was EXCELLENT. I thought I had discovered an obscure hidden gem, but my friend explained that they're already very popular, and even have another location (locations?). WHATEVER, great food is great food, regardless of how many locations they have... I brought my appetite, so got to try 5 things: 2 sandwiches, and 3 sides (4 of them were listed as daily specials). The first, and most impressive, was the \"Monday Mahi\" special sandwich. The Mahi Mahi was seasoned impeccably, perfectly complementing the seafood's flavor, while at no point overpowering it. This was a master class in seasoning! I also tried the Shrimp Po Boy. This checked all the boxes you would expect of a \"very good\" Shrimp Po Boy, though never exceeded those expectations. The shrimp were a good size, but not so big you'd tell your friends. Everything from the seasoning, breading, frying, and presentation of the Shrimp was \"above average.\" Again, this was a GOOD sandwich, just a notch below the Mahi, which absolutely DESTROYED expectations with its superior quality. The real treat is the slaw on the sandwich. It's very simple, allowing its simplicity and vinegar flavor to complement the main attractions. I almost certainly would have served the Po Boy on a different roll (it was a standard hamburger roll), but that's the only serious knock I would give them.... Sides were the pork chili (excellent, lots of fresh cheese on top, very thick, lots of pork), jalapeno cheese grits (SUBLIME!), and boudin balls (Creole dish, hard to explain, but texture wise: imagine crab cakes in ball form, but pork instead of crab, with some N'awlins seasoning. FANTASTIC!). All in all, GREAT first visit to Moe's. I'll be back!",

Yes, you North Carolina barbecue snobs can argue that this is a chain restaurant and therefore the food must not be authentic. I will tell you this, for under nine bucks, I was able to get a pulled pork sandwich side of collards and a drink and left satisfied.   The collards had big chunks of sausage in them and there was a sign saying what local farm they came from today.   Order your sandwich \"Bama style\" and they will throw coleslaw and a pickle on top.   The only disappointing part about this meal is when it was all gone.   The atmosphere is relaxed but the service was still good as well as the food. My last name is Bacon so I know good pork. Fact.",

As we were walking by, the owner(we didn't learn this until later) was by the door doing the night time closing routine. He greeted us and graciously allowed me to use the restroom. After doing that my hubby and I checked out the menu and decided that we wanted wings but we felt bad because they were already technically closed. There were a few diners and people at the bar still. We were encouraged by Drew(the owner) to order something if we wanted to and told that we were not holding them up. Win ! So we ordered some wings. We were beyond pleased with our wings. They were a good size and so wonderfully crisp. If you like smoked meats this place will satisfy. Drew also brought us complimentary desserts and homemade sweet tea. The way we were treated by Drew and his lovely wife (also the bartender) made us feel right at home     (Hubby even got a photo with the two of them, we love taking pictures with new friends). We will be going back for the food and the service. The atmosphere of the place is relaxed as well. It has an all around good vibe.",

    "text": "I don't make it to Matthews all that much.  It's just a little further out than I generally travel.  However, I have always enjoyed its small town feel.  I was in town for a meeting that ran a little over and put me in that traffic \"nightmare\" portion of the day.  Instead of braving the traffic and trekking home I thought I deserved a little reward for a good days work.   Moe's was just across from my meeting spot at the coffee shop so I asked them their opinion. They seemed to agree on everything being spot on from the brisket to the collards with one exception.  One of them absolutely loved their coleslaw and the other said it was no better than Brussels Sprouts.  Well, I do hate Brussels Sprouts, but I absolutely love coleslaw, so I thought I'd be the tie-breaker and a take look see.    I ventured over and gave the menu a once over. Elijah, who was behind the bar area, came over and asked me for my order.  I asked him about the coleslaw and he told me it was a marinated vinegar-based slaw with onions, peppers and celery seeds.  \"Sounds great.  I'll take a pint and a beer while I wait.\"    Elijah headed to the kitchen and wasn't gone all that long when I started perusing the menu more.  He brought my order out and placed it by my side just as I realized that they had Jalapeno Cheese Grits.  \"I'd like to place another order.\"  He smiled and I proceeded to order a pint of the grits.  He asked if there was anything else I desired to which I thanked him and told him that I was golden.  Once again he headed towards the kitchen and I continued drinking my beer and digesting the rest of the menu.  He was probably only gone a minute when I realized that my eyes had missed their Holy Grail.  Moe's has a White BBQ Sauce.  \"Get out of town!\"  I'm from Lower Alabama (LA) and everybody in Alabama knows that Northern Alabama is the birthplace of white BBQ sauce: just about the only good thing to come out of Northern Alabama by the way, but I digress,  Now white sauce is a mayonnaise-based sauce, made tangy with the addition of vinegar, horseradish, and mustard.  You can use it as a basting sauce, topping, or even a dipping sauce with chips.  It's a redneck ambrosia.  Once you've gone white sauce, you'll never go red again.    I placed an order for a BBQ sandwich with their delectable white sauce.  It didn't take the pit long to prepare the sandwich   When he brought it out, it was packed full of meat: a bit more than I had expected actually.  Elijah threw in a side of the white sauce for me to use with my meal as well.  I took it all to go.  It took me another several hours to finally make it home.  I figured the cole slaw would survive, but I was a bit concerned that the sandwich and grits would have kicked the bucket by then.  To my amazement, the grits held their own and were easy to resuscitate. The sandwich tasted just fine.  In fact, I ate it all in a single sitting and used the extra White sauce for dipping purposes.  I guess I was a little surprised at the quality of the white sauce.  I half expected it to be a cheap knock-off of the real deal.  It turns the founders of Moe's had attended school at Tuscaloosa before entering the BBQ business.  I suppose one of them had brought the recipe for the sauce along.  It was very authentic and much better than bottled varieties you can buy in the store.  All in all, Moe's is something special.  I have not had a full meal, but what I have had was delicious.  The cole slaw was good.  It definitely had a vinegar taste and wasn't all that heavy.  That's a good thing when you're eating BBQ.  Need to save room for the good stuff.    Five Stars for service; Five Stars for the White BBQ Sauce; Five Stars for the Sandwich and grits; Four stars for the Cole Slaw.    Kudos --",

As a restaurant in downtown Matthews, lunch traffic is what keeps you afloat and I'll go on record as saying that this does not \"often\" happen at Moe's but today I'm upset. BBQ restaurants are or at least should be the fastest delivery in the area considering most items are typically prepared in advance. But if I order a basic sandwich at 3:10pm and you say it'll be delivered within 10min I expect it in the time frame YOU set (within reason cause we're all human) 35min later you better keep the sandwich, issue a refund and hope I decide to not take my business to Macs or City BBQ going forward. Learn from your mistake cause I'll be checking back soon",

The pulled pork wasn't really pulled, it was just big chucks of pork. It was so salty and really dry. Once I drowned it with BBQ sauce I was able to eat it, but I didn't eat about half of it because it was so salty. The Mac and cheese tasted like it came out of a box. The corn was hard as a rock. It was HORRIBLE. It reminded me of a burnt Texas toast with no flavor.  My husband had the ribs but he said the flavor was off. There was a lot of meat on it, but he said otherwise wasn't very good.  The other members of my family had the ribs, chicken tenders and rice and red beans. We all agreed we wouldn't come back here. It was pricey and the food wasn't good. Go to the other side of matthews and go to Shane's rib shack. The only reason I have 2 stars is because the employees were nice.",

My sides were black beans & rice and roasted brussel sprouts. Good gawd it was so good. Because I don't cook with much salt or with much spice at home, both were a little heavy for my liking but that won't stop me from ordering the ensemble again. Live large, right? Lots of local beers on tap too. Enjoy!",

They have special sides of the day they rotate through that are creative. They also have some staple side items as well. I thought it was interesting that a previous review said not to get the slaw because it isn't traditional. That's a strange thing to say. Just because it's not traditional that means it is no good? I happen to love it. It's fine to say you don't like it and explain why, but to tell someone not to get it is ridiculous. It is vinegar based, not mayonnaise based. That is why I like it. They add green bell pepper to it, which does make it unique. Actually, it is traditional to have vinegar based slaw in the south. To each his own!",

    "text": "This tasty BBQ joint in downtown Matthews has a fantastic beer selection, good food and a fun, laid-back vibe. I only wish it hadn't taken so long to enjoy our meal. Without table service, guests order food from a single register at the counter, and getting through the line took close to 20 minutes during our recent visit. Plates are delivered to your table, but they leave it to you to clean up afterward. I wish I could say this was reflected in the price, but Moe's is no less expensive then other comparable BBQ joints -- although you do save on tips. There's ample seating inside, as well as a smattering of tables on the street.   The food was solid, from the delicious wings we shared as an appetizer, to the succulent pulled pork I ordered for my entree. The Mac n' Cheese and baked bean sides were decent, but both could've used more flavor. Honestly, having heard how great the food was here, I was expecting a bit more.  The beer selection, however, is the real highlight. Craft brews from Charlotte and other parts of NC are prominently featured, but there were also some interesting choices from other parts of the U.S. On our visit, I enjoyed two delicious pints of Wicked Weed's Pernicious IPA, which isn't the easiest brew to find on tap.   I wanted to like this place more, but it just took WAY to long to place our order the night we were there. If Moe's wants to keep its counter ordering system in place, it needs to have more than one register going at a time.",

Meat as tender and delightful as they should be when done right, baked potato perfect to where you can dig in no problem with a plastic spoon, and very-cheesy Mac and cheese.   Pulled pork sandwich was also well done and greatly amplified when adding the BBQ sauce that is at every table.   On top of the great food, the guy at the register was very personable and had a quick chat with us about our day plans and even gave some useful recommendations. Friendly people & good food! I recommend putting this place at the top of your barbecue list!",

My go to is the pulled pork sandwich combo \"Bama style\", meaning it comes with a white BBQ sauce.  I really like to get Mac and Cheese and dip it into their really good BBQ sauce.    They run daily side specials.  If they have the sweet potato casserole, definitely try that out!   Tried the wings one time and from what i can remember, they were pretty good.

I'm still new to this so I am trying different formats and seeing what works. I'll run things down with the good, bad and just ok.  Good: the smoked wings were banging. For those more inclined to the Queen's English, they were very good.    The banana pudding was great. Didn't taste like bananas, but tasty nonetheless.  The baked beans were good. They don't get a superlative, but better thank just ok.                                         The egg roll was all you want in a pull pork egg roll and if you don't know what you would want in a pulled pork egg roll then get it and let it inform your imagination and taste buds.  Just ok: the bread was good, but salty. As a black person, it had to have a strong salt game for me to feel it was too salty.   The Mac and cheese was ok. Nuff said  The pulled pork was standard.     The bad: the smoked chicken... the meat was ok but the skin was rubbery.   The Brunswick stew was ok for vegetable soup, but it ain't what you want if you are looking for Brunswick stew.     Overall, the highs were highs but the lows were low. So, I'll just call it a draw. Come if you are in the area, but no need for a special trip.",

Corn Bread: I loved the crispy exterior to it but it was just way too salty.  Banana Pudding: I don't taste any of the banana but it's tasty nonetheless.   Service was just okay.

    "text": "Don't do the cole slaw. It's not your traditional cole slaw. Back to the review.  I attended the Wing Fling event and my bf received a gift card for Moe's in a raffle! They were one of the last wing booths we tried and the wings were so freaking good!   We decided to go and dine at this location. I opted for the brisket with cole slaw and potato salad. My bf got the brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese and beans. The meals came with cornbread as well.   The brisket was really good! The cole slaw wasn't...One of the employees suggested the jalapeno dressing to add to it. It helped it taste better but it's a good 1.5/5 .   We still have 1/2 the gift card leftover so we'll be back for wings and to try their other sides.",

Enough spice, perfect amount of sweet. Obviously the pork and smoked meat selection is wonderful, but let's discuss the Mac and cheese. I couldn't help but ask how they made it because it's some, if not, the best I've had. Tastes like childhood with a grilled cheese flavor. Asked the kitchen how they made it and they willingly shared and gave me a sample. Highly recommend for a low key dinner or lunch or if you're craving some macaroni and cheese. I will be back that's for sure.",

The Pulled pork was solid, the sauce was good too with just the right amount of kick. The cornbread tasted like a properly executed cornbread should. I did think that the fried green tomatoes were pretty weak, it isn't hard to make some really top notch fried green tomatoes with a mild amount of effort. I once again loved the beer selection as well as the layout with garage doors that opened up for when the weather is nice. I left here stuffed from the platter so that is all I have to say about that! I was slightly irritated though that they have a space for a tip when you order at the counter and they simply bring the food out when it is ready, and there are signs that tell you to bus your own tables, sort of tacky but some places roll like that. I'd certainly come back again.",

    "text": "As usual, I am going to be the dissenter on the overwhelming WOW's of a new place.  As a disclaimer, I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with any of the food - I just didn't care for any of it.  From the sea of 4's and 5's this place has gotten, I see that very few had the ribs or BBQ, which is what I had.  The chicken seems to be a fan favorite, but I am not going to get chicken at a BBQ joint.    After visiting the folks, I found myself in Matthews and starving at 5:00 on a Thursday.  I thought I could mark off a bookmark by heading over to Moe's.  Neat brick restaurant (in a building just next to Kristopher's, and on the same street as the library) that looks very nice outside and inside.  As expected, there was no one in the place except for the employees at the early dinner time, who all seemed to be working hard tidying up the place for the Matthews Alive foot traffic starting the next day.  Including, a diligent young lady who was dragging chairs across the concrete floor (that's a pleasant noise) and using a metal cleaner to de-streak the metal stands on the tables.  Great smell from 5' away while I am trying to eat.  That was paired with Willie Nelson music being jacked up and down in volume.    Concrete floors, some roll-up windowed garage doors for a covered open patio effect with ceiling fans moving the air through (the doors were down though - it is summer in NC - 90 degrees with a possible storm at any minute).  There is also some outdoor seating.  I loved the concrete pig bench just inside the doors - very cute.    You order at the counter (be sure to checkout the special/sides on the chalk board at the entrance and the chalk board next to where you order) and are given a number to put on your table, food is brought to you.  I headed around the corner to get my drink and saw a sign above plastic squirt bottles of a dark sauce stating they only have one BBQ sauce.  You had best like it, because that is what goes on your meats.  I didn't like it.  I prefer a sweeter western style; this was a thicker sauce, but more vinegar than sweet and very strong.  Bleh.    The food: I wanted to try a little bit of everything, so an order of 6 ribs, 3 oz. of pulled pork, skillet corn (one of the side specials), mac and cheese, banana pudding (it's a side) and a piece of cornbread (and a drink) was just over $20.    The ribs: Meh.  Fine in size.  They said the meat is smoked, but that isn't what I tasted.  They tasted similar to the ribs I do in my oven.  Meaty, but with fatty veins, and drizzled with the BBQ sauce that I didn't like.  I like ribs that can stand on their own without the sauce, these would not to me.  Meat was tender though. The pulled pork:  The pork was vinegary, though cooked well and tender.  Covered in the BBQ sauce that I didn't like.  Again, I wasn't tasting the smoked flavor, just vinegar this time. Skillet corn:  Excellent.  A mixture of tender corn, red peppers, celery and maybe some onion (?), and a couple of small pieces of sausage/kielbasa.  Well flavored and a good side.  Corn shouldn't be the favorite dish at a BBQ joint. Mac and cheese:  Meh.  I believe it was baked at some point and then crammed into the plastic containers that the sides come in, which it then molded to the cup.  Lukewarm.  Congealed cheese.  No. Banana pudding:  Wafer on top, wafer on the bottom, thick and creamy pudding between.  Nothing earth shattering, but not neon yellow or jaw-clenching sweet, this was my #2 favorite of the meal behind the skillet corn.  Cornbread:  Maybe I am not accustomed to the flavors of wherever this recipe for cornbread came from, but never in my 38 years have I had cornbread that was finished on the grill.  I think there were pieces of jalapeno in it - dry, crumbly and grilled.  Nope.  I ate all of the sides and pulled pork and took most of the ribs and cornbread to my mom for her to try before she schleps my dad over there.  She wasn't a fan either.    This was not a meal worthy of $20 in quality, though the portions were fine.  The young man that took my order was a typical ambivalent teen, the young lady that brought my food was pleasant (that is the only interaction you will have with staff - you order with them and they drop off the food at your table - you get your own drinks, condiments, BBQ sauce, etc., and bus your table yourself).  I didn't like the BBQ sauce at all.  And though I was the only diner in the place, it would have been nice to not have to listen to Willie at full blast (and then silent, and then full blast again) and have the chemical-spraying cleaning crew scuttling about.  I like chains, I don't knock them as there is something to be said about reliable consistency of a brand, but this tastes like chain BBQ to me.    \"I ain't going back.\" - Pawpaw C.",

    "text": "First time in the Charlotte area so I wanted to try something local instead of a chain. The hostess walked us through the menu and was very helpful and welcoming. I picked the pulled pork platter with sides of sweet potato casserole and collard greens. My daughter had a side to spare so I had her select the banana pudding. All I can say is Wow! Everything tasted delicious! Not a big collard greens fan but heard these were to die for. Yep. They were. Sweet potato casserole was fresh out of the oven (hot!). Pork was tender and juicy although a might warm, not hot. Corn bread was awesome as well even though I prefer mine a little bit sweeter. Topped off with banana puddin' that was just like my moms used to make with a 'Nilla wafer on top. Sweet tea of course to wash it all down. I will definitely be going back there next time I cime around. Yum.",

I got the pulled pork,  Mac and cheese,  collards and the pulled pork egg rolls.  The egg rolls were my favorite (and not because they gave me a double order by mistake).  They were stuffed full and the peach dipping sauce was the perfect compliment.  If I'm ever in the neighborhood again I will go back.  This time to try the smoked wings!",

You take a number , sit wherever  you want, and the food comes to you. It's pretty fast for a bbq joint. The glass garage doors all around are a pretty cool touch. I'm sure it's a nice place to be in the spring or fall when the weather is on point. The 6 rib platter is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!

The dry rub/spices that they put on the ribs are delicious! The corn bread is to die for!! The Mac & cheese is my favorite side and super yummy. The banana pudding has a hint of nutmeg and possibly cinnamon too, which is good. I really enjoy the atmosphere and the service/workers are great!  They get stars short because of the sauce. BBQ sauce is super important in a BBQ place, but the sauce here is just not very flavorful. Also the baked beans are very, very sweet. I don't get beans often, so different batches can possibly vary, but it's been too much on the sweet side opposed to other baked beans I've had from other places before.",

A small group of is were in the mood for BBQ and kept being told about Mose's by our neighbors. We figured we'd check it out. If you rose a platter (BBQ sandwich with two sides) it'll cost you almost $10. That $10 gets you a small sandwich with a small amount of sauce and two small side portions. Your side portions are the size of large Jell-O shots.   After requesting no pickles on the sandwich, I ended up with pickles. I wasn't too irked by it until I tasted the sandwich and realized the BBQ sauce, what little there was, has a strong pickle flavor. My system and pickles do not get along so I was unable to eat much of the sandwich and, instead, delved into the mac & cheese side. It was tasty but a small portion and the cheese mostly hung on the side of the container in a mass.   Despite my dislike of the flavor, I still would not go back as there are so many other places to get BBQ and they give you a decent sized (and much tastier) sandwich for your money.",

Wednesday special AWSOME fried chicken w/2 sides. $10 The chicken was basically OK although 2 out 3 pieces weren't cooked as thoroughly as I like - chicken is the ONLY thing I like well done, nothing else.  2.5 stars a side of ribs: 3 pieces for $3 not a bad value, but the ribs meh! The primary flavor was salt with a vague smoky aftertaste, and wazzup with pickles? I would never order it again 2 stars Corn bread, the worse I ever had.  0 stars Baked beans, exact same corn syrup sweet stuff your neighbors serve at every bbq.  2 stars Potato salad : where the hell did they get the idea that using lots of pickled jalapeno would make a potato salad taste good?

I had the sweet tea which was spot -on for how I like it. Not to sweet like you find at many restaurants. I'm a native Charlottean but I probably like my tea less-sweet than other southern folks. Nonetheless, good BBQ in Charlotte is sparse but I would say these guys are heading in the right direction with the pork BBQ.  If you like pork BBQ, this is worth your time and money for a try.",

    "text": "Normally when I'm checking out a chain BBQ joint, I make sure to not get my hopes up too much.  But with a friend of mine recommending that I give it a shot, I decided \"why not?\"  And I usually don't write reviews after the first visit, but I decided to after this experience.  As I walked up to the door, I could smell the smoke, and the sight of logs out back gave me hope.  I walked up to the counter and ordered a smoked chicken sandwich \"Alabama style\" (which means they add slaw and Alabama white sauce) with potato salad and banana pudding as my sides (more on that later).  The total (with a $2 tip) was just under $12.  The price may seem a bit steep, but the price included my beverage.  First off, the chicken on the smoked chicken sandwich was a mixture of white and dark meat and was smoked quite nicely.  The sandwich was sauced just right, with just the right amount of slaw.    And for the sides...  they're served in small plastic cups and could be consTrued as being a bit on the small side.  The banana pudding I ordered was actually the color of bananas (and not that neon yellow that you often see), with a vanilla wafer on top and on bottom.  Not overly sugary and adequately pleasing.  And for the potato salad... well, I never got to taste it.  When I first received my meal, I discovered a hair in my potato salad.  I asked for a replacement, only for that replacement to also have a hair in it.  Frustrated, I asked for a completely different side (baked beans).  I was brought out an order of baked beans (which had a bold, tangy flavor that I prefer).  A few minutes later, the manager came over with a $10 gift card and apologized for the potato salad incident (and also let me know that they trashed that batch of potato salad).  Before leaving, she also gave me a second batch of banana pudding.    This was an excellent example of customer service, and I'll definitely be returning!",
