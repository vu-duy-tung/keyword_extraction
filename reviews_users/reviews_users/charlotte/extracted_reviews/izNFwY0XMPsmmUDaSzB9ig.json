The floors were dirty, the busing and cleaning of empty tables was almost non-existent.  Half of the empty tables had food from the previous customer on them and no one was cleaning them. There is a salad-bar like set-up to choose the kind of salsa you wanted; it was so disgusting with spillage that we just passed on touching anything there.  I will give it another month to work out the kinks.  I really do hope it improves but I was not impressed at all with my first visit.",

Waited over 30 minutes and never received order.  We were told multiple time 5 minutes.  Hard to explain to a Hungary 6 year old. Finally got disgusted and got a refund.   We were given a gift card however.   Will not return. Giving the gift card to the friend who recommended the place.   The food I saw being delivered looked pretty good though. Went to Harris Teeter and got some pizza.  Pretty good.",

I arrived in 15 minutes, paid, then had to wait another 15 minutes to receive my good. I ordered chips with my food and didn't receive it and had to wait another 5 minutes on that. To top it all off, the employees, especially the guy running the register, weren't even friendly.

Soggy, floppy chips, no seasoning to be found in our nearly 50 dollar order, bland salsas, the tortillas are very poorly made and fall apart easily. I do have to give credit to the perfectly fried empanada dough, But the filling was completely void of flavor. The atmosphere of the place is not great either. The line for ordering is smack dab inbetween the pick up window for servers and the tables, and im sure the servers are just as annoyed as the patrons for having to fight through a small herd of people to deliver food. Not to mention the bulidings great acoustics, loud music and screaming workers. I left hungry and with ringing ears. I would have tried a cocktail, but the bartender was very busy with other tasks and hardly at the bar. Ill be sticking with Tequlias in Rock Hill.",

It was as dry as concrete even when dunked in sauce and the flavor was missing.  I will be going back to give this place a second chance.  I hope my opinion will change upon a second try.  However, based in my first meal I not not recommend staying away strongly enough.  Just go to Charanda of Fort Mill.",

Wifey and I ordered the BYOB burrito bowl and although the taste was just ok, the portions were so small both my wife and I left hungry.  Leaving hungry from a Mexican/Latin restaurant you say?  Exactly.  And in most similar type establishments you order a burrito and they throw in a handful of chips.  Not here.  I found myself stealing my kids chips for salsa dipping, irritating everybody.  Also, my daughter's taco shell looked like one I can buy at the local Walmart.  Yum.  On the plus side it seemed they had a decent selection of the local brews, albeit what everybody else has.  We will probably try it again on a low risk kids eat free night but I suspect the results will be similar.  Definitely will not be dropping that much $$ again and having to go home to get the 2nd course.",

The ones in Charlotte, especially NoDa, have such limited seating that you can't find a place to sit! In the Fort Mill location there is PLENTY of seating. So nice. The food was so good and speedily produced. I did go on a Tuesday afternoon so it may be different on a Friday night but I could not find anything to complain about! Love this place and will be going back many times!",

This place is amazing and if you are on a health kick you are in luck my friend. Quinoa Avocado bowl is amazing, add some shrimp and you have just upped the game. Not on a diet, good lord please do yourself a favor and get the nachos or empanadas! Carne Asada fries also take this game to another level. Right now they just have beer and wine! (Tons of local craft beers)  They have applied for the liquor license and we will soon be having margaritas with our food. Lastly, don't forget to stop by the salsa bar before you eat and grab some salsas to add flavor! Pineapple habanero salsa is the shiznick!  That's all for now! No go get you some good good! You won't be sorry!",

We told the server, checked the queso didn't have any form of gluten in, asked to make a note on our order so the preparers would be careful for cross contamination. She reassured us she would take care of it. Two hours later my son was doubled over with stomach cramps and had to take the next two days off school. Really sad to see a 10 year old suffer like that just because a restaurant was so careless. Show less",

    "text": "Everything you love about the Elizabeth location PLUS A BAR (and much easier parking). That's right, not only can you get your pineapple habanero salsa fix, but you can also belly up to the bar and grab a beer (8 drafts or bottle/can) or wine (no liquor yet, but they're working on it).   The fella and I made the mistake of going on a Wednesday, which is kids eat free night, and the noise level was mucho loud, but we were able to get a little peace in the corner at the bar. Aaahhh. It was slam packed, which could be because of the free kids' meals... or most likely just because it's Sabor. I branched out from my usual tacos autenticos and tried the empanada with beef, and it was divine. We had a coupon for a free empanada, so two tacos, a basket of chips, a beer, and a cider only cost us $20.  Delicious AND cheap AND a bar AND easy parking? Perfecto!!",

I stopped getting burritos as often as I used to because most of the time they were missing an ingredient (usually queso, which I usually order and pay extra for) I just mobile ordered, had specified that I wanted my extra queso in the side (just Incase there was none on the burrito so if at least have a side of it even though I'd be paying extra), when I picked it up there was no extra side of queso like I had asked and as expected, no queso in my burrito. I used to love this location and this restaurant. I'd come here regularly with my boyfriend and it got to the point we would always get burritos and the employees recognized us. Then the burritos stopped having consistency and weren't as good. Stopped getting them as much. Stopped coming as much. Still the same.",

We had to go get our own drinks the first time   It may have been their first one so maybe they weren't ready for that sort of volume and we did get their later in the evening  The manager came out and talked to us and took care of the situation we had well.

Richard said it was not a problem and he made a great suggestion with the shrimp tacos with flour tortillas, shred lettuce and tomatoes. Wow, everything was so fresh and really exceptional.  They have an extensive menu and the $1 tacos for happy hour looks like a winner.  Plenty of free parking and easy in and out intersection.",

Not to mention six choices of salsa that will fit all taste buds across the board.   We got the chicken nachos. When it first got delivered it appeared lacking some color. The server quickly came back and mentioned that there were items missing, took it back and quickly returned with a mound of lettuce, sour cream, pico de gallo & guacamole with a little more queso.  HUGE difference. So pics may not be True to how they would have served it if all the other stuff was not left out. It was quite tasty!!  Tuesdays are great as it is $1 tacos all day long. They are a little bland so taking advantage of the limes (provided) and salsa station is a must. But they are a buck so you know.  And they have select brews on special, which is always nice. They have a few local crafts too. Good place to go if you do not feel like cooking and want to unwind from the day throwing back a few brews.",

As usual I had their Americanos steak tacos, their loco corn and sweet plantains.. All are what I expected. Since I ordered these before..   Customer Service: 3/5 they were all ok. Nothing to it.. Not very personable and delivers our food accordingly.   Resturant: 4/5 overall very clean.. There's no one after we were half way thru our meals but I know the tables were left unclean after customers left..   I do enjoy Sabor. Have the pleasure of meeting the owners at a Yelp event. So I know they care about the kind of foods they put out. So I'll be back!",

Maybe that's the other locations as this is probably one of the worst Mexican meals I've ever had.   The chips were OK at first until the top layer of strategically placed decent unbroken chips were gone. Then it was tiny shards of broken chips as big as a quarter. It can't be an accident that the top chips were good and the ones underneath were smashed up.   I ordered the \"sabor especiale\". By my understanding \"especiale\" means \"special\". What was special about this was absolutely \"nada\". Poorly seasoned and lacking taste and it would appear they wrapped it with their feet as the wrap barely overlapped at the edges.   The wife ordered rapa el pastor which was OK. Nothing special and two fish tacos. The fish tacos were OK except for the fact the tortillas were torn and just fell apart when trying to pick them up which doesn't really make it a taco.   Maybe it was an off day for them but I doubt we'll be in a rush to return which is a shame seeing as it's just up the street from us.",

We checked in on yelp when we first got there and saw we could get free chips with our order. When we were getting our drinks before even finding a table one of the boys that worked there asked if we were gonna get any of the salsas so he could clean it up. He ended up leaving them out for us but I just didn't understand why he was trying to clean up so early before they closed with multiple tables of guests still in the restaurant.

When you walk inside it's actually quite spacious and has an industrial vibe. It's counter service but after you order they give a number and bring your order to you when it's ready. I ordered the carne asada fries which basically amounted to French fry nachos. The fries were fresh and the steak was well seasoned and tender. It was also topped guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and cheese. It all came together quite well. They also have a full service bar. All in all, I definitely recommend a stop in if you're in the area.",

This is rare because my kids don't usually like new places we eat at. My quinoa bowl was fresh and delicious. I added the shrimp to it, which was done just right on the grill. We had a great overall experience!",

This location has a bar area so it's my fave location. Salsa bar is delish (I like to mix the pineapple salsa with the mild). Other foods I like are Carne Asada Fries and Chorizo Empanada. Mike was my bartender and he's a personable guy. The staff is much better now as they have made some changes. #lovemesomesabor",

    "text": "When this location first opened, I literally walked out because it was crowded and the line was super long and there was nowhere to sit. After standing in line for about five minutes and not moving, we walked out.   I'm glad to say this is not the case any more. We decided to give it a second try for Taco Tuesday. We were able to order right away. Staff was friendly and explained some of the menu items. I think about three people came to ask us how our food was. On Tuesdays, the tacos autenticos are $1 which is a really good deal. I got three shredded chicken and my free chips for checking in. The hubby also got tacos and loaded nachos.   The tacos were good, but are messy to eat. Seriously grab some napkins. There is a lot of meat on each taco. The shredded chicken was seasoned nicely. For me, the chopped onions were too many for me since I get a headache after eating raw onions sometimes. So in the future, I'll order them without. I liked the salsa bar. My favorite is the pineapple habenero,  a good blend of sweet and heat.   I tried some of the nachos and they were good. The nachos themselves are not greasy and have a good crunch. The toppings were all delicious. I appreciated the guac and the queso was nice and melty. It was a huge portion.   This location used a lot of the furniture from the previous burger place. If you are a bigger person, the chairs can be uncomfortable.",

    "text": "First, let me preface this that I a few months ago I ate at the NoDa location and also was not impressed with that one. I finally made a return visit to Fort Mill/Tega Cay, and I must say, after the hype has died down, it was better. I got a burrito bowl which had a lot of flavor to it and was reasonably priced. The queso in it was delicious. The place was much cleaner this time too - no nastiness on the floor or around the salsa. Service was quick and friendly. The only negative was that they ran out of cheese for the elote, but at 7:00 p.m on Sundayy, I can forgive that. I'll be back.",
