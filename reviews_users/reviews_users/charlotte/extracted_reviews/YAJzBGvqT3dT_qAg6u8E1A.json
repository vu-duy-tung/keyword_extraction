Their haddock fish fry is out of this world, and it's the same fish they throw on their soft tacos, which is usually my go-to.   The beef on weck is also a popular choice and is served with a generous amount of fries (or any side for that matter). They also have \"spot tots\" which are sweet potato tater tots! Such an amazing taste!   I would highly recommend checking out this dude loving, buffalo supporting bar/restaurant in Dilworth if you have the chance, you won't be disappointed!",

They are delicious and so salty, my hands still look like a teenagers' again (#cheatdayperk).  We were regulars at the old Township Grill in Matthews so we're already biased to like this place. Plus, I'm married to a Yankee from around Buffalo so we are always up for wings and weck!  Kids came with us this time, they're finally getting into wings (#parentingdoneright) and we needed some weck.  Sunday at 615p, it was busy but not crazy, we had a table in just a few minutes.  Love the decor, because i love The Dude.  DH and I had the wings and weck, which was good. The weck was not piled high like it used to be, maybe they sensed that portion control is not one of my strong suits? Still tender and amazing. I had the Spots (sweet potato tots, yes i had to ask) which were fine but a small portion.  Kiddos had wings and fries.  It was health food at its finest.  We'll come back on date night for White Russians and that awesome beer menu.  They run specials all week so check it out.  Plus, it's not a chain. #extracredit.",

I was so excited to see familiar things on the menu like beef on weck , haddock fish fry and hot Buffalo wings! Let's just say I had all three. With a side of awesome fries.  SO good! The hot wings were really hot but good, not too salty. Just like we do in B-Lo! The fish was perfectly flaky and crispy. We visited on a Thursday night at about 10:00 and they were still going strong, not crowded, but not empty either.  I loved it and will definitely return.",

Me: Can we at least try something? I have a place bookmarked. Casual place, shouldn't be any problem getting in.   And we didn't. And it was a really good Saturday night dinner. This was our first time here and sure as hell won't be our last. First of all, I can't commend the staff enough. The friendliest bunch of people will do anything to give you recommendations or suggestions. The food was great as well! I got their pimento burger with garlic fries (which I really really recommend), and the lady ordered the Mission Bay Salad (with the added haddock and dressing), not to be missed. I can't wait to go back and try out more of their offerings, especially their wings and Beef on 'Weck.

In my opinion, the Beef on Weck is a little too plain for me. I like having cheese and sauce on it so I recommend the Fredonia Dip if you're like-minded.  Hadn't tried the wings until my most recent trip, and oh my gosh were they delicious. Screw the French Dips, the wings were much better, in my opinion.  Sampled the stingers and jerkiyaki which were both incredible. The wings themselves were on the small size but the flavors of both easily compensated. Great price, great food, great environment. I love this place. Shomer Shabbos.",

    "text": "One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in recent memory (which is why I'm yelp-ing about it, normally it doesn't seem fair to complain but like, don't mess with my burger night). Things started well, we were sat, ordered drinks, ordered burgers. I ordered mine medium rare, my dad same temp, my mom medium. Burgers came. All are well done. Like, indisputably well done. Gray. Gross. My parents are like whatever but I'm like \"nah this is my one night out in Charlotte (I was visiting them) and I haven't had a burger in ages and I chose this burger, so I'm not eating this hockey puck poor excuse for a med rare burger.\" I said that in my head, not to them or anyone else. I called the server over (who was very nice and present, not a single complaint there), and told him I'd ordered med rare and this was well done. He took it away and I waited for my burger while my parents ate their dry lukewarm burgers. The fries were ok though. Eventually my burger comes back and it's like PIPING hot, super greasy (at first I thought the grease was burger juice and I was like 'cool, this bodes well') until I realized it was in fact, just grease, and somehow, SOMEHOW, still not medium rare. How do you have a place that says they have awesome burgers and not know how to cook a burger med rare? Like at this point I have a really hot greasy burger that is somehow still overdone and dry and I'm just confused? That's almost impressive. I had the feeling that they'd maybe deep fried the burger in oil to get it done faster - it's the only explanation I could come up with. I was hungry, so I ate most of it, and then felt pretty sick (but like, I kinda blame myself for that one cause I really knew better). Like I said, server was nice but not overly apologetic. We paid and left. I'm pretty bummed I spent my night out and my burger night on this place. Definitely won't be returning.  Props for the driest but also greasiest and hottest burger I've had in a long time - maybe there's a market for that?",

We ordered hot buffalo wings for an appetizer which would be the best part of the dining experience at Lebowski's. Not overly spicy to where you cannot eat them but delivered a little kick with nice flavor.   Following the wings I ordered Durango Chicken. This dish was cooked well but left something to be desired in flavor. My other half ordered the Boss Grilled Turkey Club with side of mac and cheese. He states it was a mediocre sandwich, nothing that impressed him. Mac and cheese not as cheesy or creamy as one would want, but flavor is \"alright\".  Tables are exceptionally close to each other, so if you want any privacy or are trying to choose a place that welcomes long stays and good conversation, look on to other places to better fit your needs.   If you need a little positive note to end the review on, Lebowski's has a nice beer selection and they come out ice cold which is always appreciated.",

I ordered the veggie burger with pimento cheese and onion rings, no bun.  With fries.  Very pleased with the delightful tastes.  My honey  got haddock sliders and Mac and cheese.  He also liked his meal, although he prefers his Mac to have baked on cheese instead of mere creaminess. The really outstanding feature of Lebowski's is the staff.  Nobody acts \"too cool\" like some of the young, hipster hosts and servers at other establishments.  Everyone projected a sincere attitude of happy and upbeat.  They were on it with their service.

For the most part, you can always count on this place being open and serving food.   I'm a fan of the $4 house white russian - it's like dessert first, dinner later. For meal, both times I had their sliders combo - good meatloaf (next time I will ask for more gravy), great fried fish & okay chicken parm. Only downside is their side - only chips comes with sandwiches. Or you can pay extra for other side options (even fries). BUT - when you check in on Yelp, it has a Yelp offer for side order. They let me have the chili mac and it was delish and HUGE. I know everyone loves their wings here - they are ok in my book, small in size, pretty hot for mild buffalo, and generally speaking I think their other food offerings are more satisfying.  Limited parking behind the building. so good luck.  Way to go Lebowski for keeping up the good work all these years!",

I mean, a smile goes a LONG way is all I'm saying.  On to the food!  I'm a wing junkie so naturally we ordered some wings for appetizers. And of course, a round of drinks. Our drinks arrived much later than they should have considering we were right next to the bar and everyone was focused on the trivia... We were really hungry and really looking forward to those carolina gold and hot wings that... never arrived. Our burgers showed up first.   I ordered the Jerk Style Burger with onions, very very tastey! I had never tried anything like it and there wasn't a crumb left. This burger has won awards, you should try it!  Back to the wings--we were told there was a \"communication error\" with the computers and the kitchen never got our wing order. They would be \"right out.\" We informed our server (again) that those were appetizers and our meal was already here. We weren't impressed and let him know. Our wings came out, and were comped. They were delicious and ended up being dessert for the crew.  In short--the food was great but the service was... not enthusiastic or speedy by any means. I'll definitely go back, but I expect better service, Lebowskis!",

I've had a salad, their trio (had to try the famous beef on weck!), but the veggie panini is my favorite.  Beer selection is good, and the bartender let me try a new flavor before ordering a full glass (good thing, because I wasn't a fan and ordered my usual OMB Copper!).  Service is sometimes slow but the staff is friendly, and I'm happy to support this local, family-owned place.",

We were offered water but that was the last we saw of our server for a while.  We decided on our food but she never came back.  We placed the menus on the table- maybe she thought we were still deciding.  We stacked the menus on top of each other- never saw her.  Eventually, we had to grab someone, anyone, to take our order. I had a burger (jerk style I think).  It was great.  I could have eaten 2 or 3 of them.  Someone else had the wings- they looked great and I'll be ordering them next time.  Other than waiting for what seemed like forever to place my order, I had a good experience here.  The food was good and they had a nice selection.  I will return to this place in the future.",

The CLT deal cost $7.50 and paid for our whole meal (worth $25) so it was one of the least expensive and best lunches I've had in Dilworth!  The service was prompt and attentive..... A definite Keeper for a speedy and filling lunch!",

About a week ago, my boyfriend and I decided to abandon Cantina and give Lebowski's a go.   We ended up getting there a little after 10 o'clock and had NO idea that they stopped serving their whole menu about 5 minutes before we got there! We had to select from their late night fare which includes fairly basic bar food.   I selected the Tuscan style burger with bruschetta, pesto aioli, and parmesan cheese with a side of garlic fries. The burger turned out to be really great and the fries were a great compliment. I usually prefer all the accoutrements with my burger but this one was really great on its own. My boyfriend got the Lebowski burger and loved it!  In addition to the surprisingly great food, the service and atmosphere was great. They had some really good drink specials that day and are famous for their White Russians which I look forward to trying on my next visit!",

The wings are probably my favorite in the Charlotte area, in fact, this is the only place that I crave wings from.  The beef on weck was amazing.  I wanted to try something different so I had the chicken sandwich, jerk style because the waitress confirmed that it was really good and my husband had the Fredonia Dip.  I did not enjoy the \"jerk style\" on my chicken sandwich, although the chicken was fine.  My husband said his Fredonia dip was good but not as good as the Beef of Weck.  Overall, the food is great.  Oh...did I mention the garlic fries?  Those are yummy too!  A great place to hang out for lunch, everyone is friendly and it has a great patio with a TV to watch football!  I think I might stop by for a beer one night too since it has a cute little bar - but be warned, it's not big and doesn't have a lot of stools.",

    "text": "Nice place located in the heart of Dilworth and the East Blvd corridor. Stopped by for lunch recently and sat outside on the nice patio. Waitress was nice, but a little slow considering the amount of tables that day. Not a big deal because the weather was beautiful outside and I had PBR in hand.   Ordered the chicken wings and the roast beef sandwich. I was told the chicken wings would take a little long (20 minutes) so I appreciated the heads up. That said; I love me some wings and have ordered them at several locations around town, both chain and non-chain. They've never taken that long, so I was curious. Needless to say, wen they arrived they were typical wings so I wondered why the 20 minutes was necessary. However, they were good and I went with the special sauce, which I can't remember at this time, but the waitress recommended it and it was flavorful. The roast beef sandwich was pretty good. My only complaint was the extra salt on top of the bun. Added a little too much salt as the au jus hand more than enough.   This is the first restaurant that has a chance to make it in this spot as the former ones kept changing every year. I'll be back to try some other items soon.",

Food is pretty good, recommend the pork, beef on wheck and the hamburgers. The wings were pretty awesome until they caved to customer pressure to cook them faster.

I had high expectations for the fried haddock based on previous reviews and marked as a house favorite-it was good, not amazing. Maybe the breading wasn't my favorite? I couldn't really put my finger on it. The garlic fries were also pretty good, and the boneless medium wings were spicier than expected (but still tasty). The coleslaw however, I hated. The vinegar was really strong in it, and to be fair, I'm hard to please with coleslaw to begin with. Overall I would still come back to try other foods. The staff was friendly and attentive.

My hubby had a beef on weck slider which was served cold. The fish fry is not Buffalo's traditional beer battered style, although it had decent flavor. The wings were limp and not cooked crisp. The atmosphere reminded us of a Buffalo tavern but really is grungy and needs updating. The ceiling fans are filthy, thank goodness they were not turned on. Won't be back.",

Which is a major red flag because if you can't satisfy me with the most standard chicken wing in the game, you shouldn't be playing. The blackened wings were a whole new level of bad, just have a look at the picture. I'm all for the dry rub, but these wings weren't blackened underneath, they were straight burnt. If you want good wings, better make the drive down to the Moose.",

Crowded on a Friday night and we had to wait a little for a table. They have a good bottle/can selection and a whole menu of white russians (of course).   I could have thrown a dart at the menu and been happy with whatever the outcome was. Everything sounded good.   Being there for the duration of the game, we started with wings. Yep, they are good. I loved the hot buffalo sauce, thought the garlic parm dry rub was a little boring. The blue cheese dressing is very good, you can tell its homemade. We also got a small order of the buffalo chicken nachos. Not my favorite since there wasn't any melty cheese to keep the toppings on the chips.   But the crispy haddock. Wow. I would never think to order fish and chips in a restaurant, but I kept seeing everyone's plates come out and it looked amazing. Definitely the best fried fish I have ever had. The tarter sauce it comes with is great and the garlic fries are a must-get! Also split the roast beef on weck. It was really good, I loaded mine up with the horsey sauce.   My only regret is not saving room for a white russian. We enjoyed our meal so much we went back to watch the Sunday game too!   They have great daily food specials and a lot of combination plates when you cant decide what you want. You can even get a combo with fish, a beef on weck slider and 6 wings! Best of everything.",

I first walked in and felt I was home (Cleveland, OH) up North with their Buffalo sings and the smell of sweet comfort food. Atmosphere, 10! Waitress, 10! Now onto the food. So much to pick from and only so much room in my belly. I split the chicken nachos and one their burgers. First off the chicken nachos were just average, as the waitress warned me. But the burger was so so delish!! The buttered bun added that north Home taste. Wings are my next must try on my next visit!!! Great place for food and fun!",

I can honestly say it's the best food I've had in a very long time (and my family orders takeout a lot) each time better than the time before. For anyone who loves pulled pork, their Memphis Style sandwich is nothing short of spectacular!!! Tender and juicy on grilled sourdough bread with pepper jack cheese, I didn't even know I liked pepper jack cheese, it's easily become my new favorite meal. Sandwiches come with chips but I spend the extra 99 for the cinnamon apples (the best I've ever tasted). My son loves the Lebowski burger which comes with roast beef and queso, quite the combination and not one I ever would've thought of but delicious! Definitely a place worth trying, repeatedly",

    "text": "So, in a few words: I'm a fan of this place.   I'll try to get through this entire review without dropping any cheesy Big Lebowski references....Well, okay, maybe a couple.   My favorite night to come here is on Wednesday night, as they have half priced wings & a \"mystery\" craft beer special. It's a great way to inexpensively sample your way through the wing combos, and taste a few unique brews along the way; I've definitely stumbled upon some really great beers this way. I wouldn't think that you MUST order a White Russian while you're here, but if you do--they are on special for a reduced price as well . Personally, I'm not much of a fan of the caucasian...but you know, that's just like, my opinion man.   As for the other menu items besides the (oh so delicious) wings, Lebowski's serves up an array of bar food from the Upstate NY region. I'm talkin' Beef on Weck, White Hots, Fish Fry...you get my drift. I'm sure you can definitely come in here on Sunday, watch the Bills lose, drown your sorrows in massive amounts of Blue Light & Genny Cream Ale, and talk about where you were when Frank Reich led the comeback against the Oilers.   So, if this all sounds like fun (and it should), you should definitely check them out. FYI, the parking lot can fill up in a hurry, so just be prepared to find a spot down the street if you can't get in their actual lot.",

    "text": "Love this place..just had fish tacos for lunch. I should have written this review a long time ago, as it's become quite a regular spot for me.   While many assume it's a pun on the movie, it's really a Buffalonian's Hot Spot at heart. Featuring wings, beef on wecks, and haddock fish fry, you would most likely get the same response from anyone that's from upstate NY, Lebowski's is where it's at! I'm not from Buffalo, so I speak only on hear say from other folks I've met around CLT. Growing up here in Charlotte, I must say they rank among the top of my favorite Chicken Wing spots. That Jerkiyaki is off the charts. For the vegetarians out there, they actually have some great veggie options as well, and their Mission Bay Salad (I add haddock) is ridiculous.   Yes the Dude Abides! They do play a little off of the movie featuring The Dude, for all you Big Lebowski lovers. You'll find several movie references mixed in with the Buffalo decor and fan fare. With several specialty White Russians, this place a must if you like a good Caucasion to sip on. Great beer options as well, both local and national craft options, along with all your standards.  Staff is laid back, but personable and helpful if you need any suggestions. There is a lot to choose from on the menu.",

I will admit that the Mac & Cheese was good but nothing to scream and shout about. It was better than most that I have gotten while eating out though. The Turkey Burger on the other hand is awesome!   My wife ordered the Lebowski burger which was a HUGE beef burger with roast beef on top with queso. She loved it. I had a bite and I would have preferred just the burger and queso, not the roast beef but I am not a huge fan of roast beef to begin with. On the side she got garlic fries. Again, Awesome!   We also tried the Bloody Mary. This was the best Bloody Mary I have had in a while. We also tried a couple of the many beers they have and some shot... I believe it was a whip it. Not sure but it was incredible.   Last but not least... Lizzie. AWESOME server!!! She was very friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and good conversation.   This place is great.

    "text": "\"You're not wrong Walter...\"  Tonight was my group's second trip to Lebowski's for trivia and we had sort of a... weird night.  I can't really be angry.  The buffalo wings were excellent.  The staff was friendly.  But man...  Trivia starts at 8, we get there at 7:45.  There were several groups milling around and the hostess looked a little frazzled.  She took our name, maybe a few groups ahead of us.  As we're waiting more and more people are showing up and being seated from a reservation book.  Did you know Lebowski's took reservations?  I wouldn't even think about it but I can accept that trivia is popular.  One of the reasons I was interested in the place is my brother has been to trivia dozens of times - never heard of the reservation book.  Well we waited, and waited.  We were offered a table outside but my friends turned it down.  The thing that irritated me, and I'm sure this is something you fixate on when you're waiting to be seated but - For nearly an hour a group sat with their check on their table.  As near as I could tell, and I was staring them down like a complete weirdo, no staff came by to hurry them along.  They weren't playing trivia and it was a packed house.  We were standing up playing.  We finally snagged a table, not the one I was obsessing over.  Those folks stayed over an hour after having finished.  We decided to go ahead and leave after eating.  We missed getting our question sheet for the second round amidst the hubbub of getting seated.  So a lot of this isn't Lebowski's fault but I really felt like whoever is behind restaurant karma wasn't on our side tonight.  If I was with someone lingering that bad at the table I'd just leave them there.",

My wife usually gets the fish and fries and douses them in vinegar.  They are excellent!  It's not a very big place but if you go at the right times you shouldn't have that long of a wait.",

    "text": "Determined to shake up our Saturday lunch routine, hubs and I stopped by Lebowski's to try their famous wings and take in a bit of college football in the mean time.   The first impression is a bit nondescript - Lebowski's looks like many other sports bars in Charlotte and has a nice little patio facing East Blvd. Because Mother Nature gave us a break from the 90s, we chose to sit outside and enjoy a relaxing lunch (hubs was especially happy as there are TVs outside, too!). Both the hostess and our server weren't the cheeriest of individuals...it seemed like they both had a long night out. Regardless, hubs went with the Carolina Gold wings and the Beef on Weck, I choose a side salad and the small version of the Chili & Mac 'n Cheese.   Upon ordering our server informs us that the wings take about 15-20 minutes to cook. Um...ok...that's a little odd, but we would still like them. This was noon on a Saturday in a not-so-busy restaurants. Now, I'm not a wing eater but even hubs said that that's a long time to wait for six wings. So, basically the entire time we were joking with each other that the cook had to go fetch the chickens and take care of them so he could have his wings in less than 20 minutes.   And yes, it did take 20 minutes for these wings to reach our table. I'll let hubs review his own food. As for mine...the salad was fresh but not too much to report. Their side salad included bits of iceberg and romaine, a flat crostini and a few other veggies.   As for my Chili Mac 'n Cheese, it was pretty tasty albeit the chili was a bit sweet. I had a different expectation...when I saw a cup of chili mac 'n cheese I expected a cup of chili with a bit of mac 'n cheese at the bottom. I was a bit suprised when I saw a flat dish of mac 'n cheese with a small scoop of chili on top. No worries, though, I ate it up - it was a nice little serving.   Will I be back to Lebowski's? Sure...for a few beers and maybe a snack, but I don't think it's going to make it into my trusty lunch spot list.",

But then I remember how good the beef on weck sandwich is, and I order it again and again and again.    They piled your weck roll high with thin sliced, already dipped in au jus roast beef.  (They'll give you more au jus for .49 cents extra, you don't reallllly need it, but I always get it anyway).  The employees are usually very friendly.  Last night we were seated inside, but right next to the patio door.  Every time the door opened you could smell someone's cigarette, when we asked to move the hostess was happy to accommodate us, and we slid over a few tables.  This place is a great neighborhood stop for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Quite possibly one of the best food joints in all of Charlotte. I am pretty sure at one point I was eating at least 2-3 meals here a week, granted I was also within walking distance. Obviously if you've ever stepped foot in here then you know its a Buffalo, NY establishment. I have known a couple people from up there who have had no problems driving from places like Kannapolis and Matthews just to dine here.  I highly recommend the Wings (I prefer the gold rush), the Memphis Panini, or the Jerk Burger. To be honest though the best deal is probably the chicken tenders because you get a side as well getting them tossed in wing sauce, which makes them amazing.    If its a gorgeous night out I highly recommend sitting on their patio, although its relatively small it's a good atmosphere. Plus you can bring your four-legged friend if you want. The wait staff is extremely friendly and has become part of the reason I return week after week.   Even though this place is small they have a good size beer selection. But whats even better is that they have chosen the perfect beers to both compliment their food and their clientele. However what they are really known for are their white russians, which by the way are only $4 for the house version. They also have a small bar inside in case you want to just grab a drink, chat with the bartender, and/or catch a sporting event.",

I was born and raised in Buffalo so chicken wings are a stand alone food group for me and I'm very critical! Usually I buy dry wings and make my own sauce (Franks Redhot and melted butter is all it is people!!). Let's be honest, the wings are blue cheese are not dead on like you get in Buffalo but they were still very good! I got the Buffalo style which were advertised as being medium (that's how I like my wings anyway) but they were too spicy, also they didn't taste like the classic Franks/melted butter sauce...maybe bc it was too spicy for me to get into them too much. I also tried the Gold Rush which were a tad spicy but very good but still not like the BBQ wings you get in Buffalo! But maybe that's what they weren't going for which is ok. Lastly, the blue cheese tasted home made and I really loved it, it just wasn't like Rooties or any other classic blue cheese you might get at many spots in Buffalo. I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food was really good all at reasonable prices and being from Buffalo I love the concept. Again, not dead on like you get in Buffalo but pretty darn close and very good!!",

You can always take your chances with a 'mystery beer', which is really just whatever random beer they pull and charge you $2 for haha.   Last time I headed over was for lunch. Parking in the back can get tight and can be a challenge getting out as well so be prepared. But anywho, ended up getting a half-priced deal so headed over to meet a friend. I order the buffalo chicken wrap and my friend opted for the French dip and we both had side salads - it was all very delicious! Gotta say, I was happily surprised...

To fix it management wanted to give me credit for the amount the waiter stiffed me on my next visit - yeh, like I am coming back here.  Proper thing to do would have been to credit me the side charge and the entire tip amount and put it on my credit card - but I don't think they care.",

They are cooked to perfection and don't loose their crunchiness within the sauce. We also order the fried pickles and the garlic fire both of which were absolutely delicious also. 10/10 would recommend",

They also have a nice outdoor seating.  The staff who have served me, from the waiters to the food runners, have all been friendly and kind to our family.  They have great daily specials, including my favorite -- mystery beer, where you choose a type of beer (IPA, Pale Ale, Lager, etc) and they bring you one from that category.  As far as food, everything I have had has been wonderful and my wife agrees.  Usually places like this have one thing they are known for, but everything I have tried on the menu -- Greek salad, fried fish, sliders, french fries, and wings -- has been  exceptional.  Their wings, by the way, are easily the best in Charlotte and some of the best I've ever had in all my travels.",

It was great, the bartender ask what kind of beer that I liked and chose one based on that. I've gone to places where the mystery beer is usually a cheaper non craft beer or one that doesn't sell.

Our waitress was great and was very attentive. I got the wings since i had heard a lot about them and being from the north i was craving simple buffalo wings. They were perfect. Sometimes with buffalo wings they can end up being slimy but these had the perfect amount of the Mild Buffalo sauce to give them a kick but to not overwhelm me. While i was perfectly happy with the basket of 6 wings my dad opted for 10 and finished them all off. I guess it depends on how hungry you are and what you get for a side. While my dad got the garlic fries, which are DELICIOUS, i got the mac & cheese with pecan bacon, because bacon is everything. My mom went for the junior Haddock Fish fry which was amazing as well. Lebowski's is definitely on the top of my list now when i want some great all american food for a great price! YUM!",

This Buffalo-based sandwich has yet to go national on a large scale, but, if this is a typical version, a French dip will never be the same.  Basically this is a warm roast beef sandwich whose highlight is the roll:  a salted kaiser roll with caraway seeds.  Possible toppings include traditional dip sauce, pure horseradish, creamy horseradish, mustard sauce etc.  They have many other interesting sandwiches but our short trip to Charlotte meant we couldn't sample them all.  However, we were able to order \"slider\" versions of their sandwiches which is basically 2 or 3 mini versions of their popular sandwiches.  All were excellent but the beef on weck make this a destination.",

I enjoy how small the restaurant is, makes it feel like a local hang out and very chill.   Decor was a mix of the Big Lebowski and New Belgium brewery paraphernalia.  Drink special was $1 off draft, they had about 6 beers on draft. But they also offer 50+ craft & microbrews.  We started with the Niagra Street Nachos. These were pretty tasty!  I ordered \"The Boss\" Grilled Turkey Club for dinner with their delicious garlic fries!! The pimento cheese in this panini really makes it! My husband ordered the wings which he loved as well.  Overall a good experience at Lebowski's and we will back again to sample more fare.",

I wish they had \"hot, medium, or mild\" like in WNY, but there is just \"Buffalo style\" plus three or four other flavors.  They didn't take 20 minutes, so that was good.  My guess is that they may have been baking them previously; it doesn't take more than 9 minute to deep fry chicken wings.  The fried pickles were awesome, as was the Sunday \"breakfast/lunch\" sandwich on Nova's bread.  Prices are very good too.",

    "text": "Lebowski's is a very small neighborhood bar but the bar itself is actually pretty tiny. I have heard many people rave about their wings and I've tried them but I never understood what the big deal was really. I am sort of a wing snob so maybe that is why I was not impressed but I was hoping for something more \"wow\" like when I tried my wings at Lebowski's. Overall, their food is better than your average bar food and they have a large menu with interesting food items.   They have a pretty good beer selection and most are in the bottle. There is also a decent sized patio that sits right on East Blvd so there is plenty to watch while hanging out with your friends. The atmosphere is definitely casual and I'm pretty sure it's a good spot for the service industry crew to come after work later at night. The decor inside is a little quirky and eclectic. The staff is very friendly and the bartenders are pretty well known in the area so they're good people to introduce yourself to!   Lebowski's is a great place to go by yourself just to grab a bite or a beer and meet new friends or bring your own and play trivia or mingle around on the patio outside.",

Mind you, we likely enjoyed this Western New York delicacy at least 5 times during late December but still a lite spicy snack was in order.   We ordered a couple of drinks and a double order of wings medium with a side of hot sauce. The server was prompt, pleasant and recognized us from earlier visits. It's nice to enter an eatery and be made to feel like old friends. Being a slow Monday evening, our wings were served in short order exactly as ordered.    Our wings were as meaty, spicy and flavorful as any wing I've ever consumed in WNY. And the friendly atmosphere makes Lebowski's a great place to meet friends, enjoy an adult beverage or two and sample some great wings. You'll find a rather diverse menu to choose from but don't miss the opportunity to try some of the best wings in town!",

It was also a little salty, but I can handle that too. My biggest beef with lebowskis is this. We chose to sit outside, because inside didn't have room for a table for 5. They don't have a sctrict enough policy on dogs. There where 3 dogs in this area and all of them where  barking and being very Annoying. They offered water bowls so there was a dog 2 feet away from us sloppily drinking water and shaking water everywhere. It is pretty gross. I mean this doesn't change my rating. They are still really good. But the dogs where a nuisance to everybody who didn't have the dog. And then parking. ABHORENT parking. There are about 15 spaces and only one exit/entrance that has parallel parking where another lane would go. So it is just one lane in and out. The service was great and the food was pretty good too. Im not saying I wouldn't return, but I would return more often if these things where fixed eventually.",

Never been here before but thought of Lebowski's. That description describes them pefectly.   The inside is decorated very laid back with lights stringing across the ceiling. They had about 10 beers on tap, mostly local. I ordered one of Sycamore's IPAs.  My husband and I decided to split the Jerk Veggie Burger with garlic fries and 6 wings (Stingers sauce). I couldnt even tell that the veggie burg wasn't meat!! (great sign for veggie and black bean burg lovers like myself). The pineapple and jerk sauce on the burger were a perfect combo. Came with tons of fries! I only had one bite of the wings, but based on how fast my husband ate them, they had to have been amazing. I thought the bite I had was well sauced. My parents split the french dip sandwich and some chicken fingers.   Great night. My parents loved the food and we were excited to have checked out this great neighborhood-like bar!",

I apologize... maybe I gave it a lower star rating so that I would keep this place as my own little secret.  Just as a \"downer\" note, the parking lot in back does tend to get a bit crowded, but if you can walk to this spot, its ideal and you don't have to play bumper cars with the folks out back.  Everything else about this place is great!  Servers are super nice and top-notch.  Even when this place is super busy and they are running around like crazy, they make sure you got everything you need and are enjoying your experience.

We had a party of 10 on a Saturday night and we were seated quickly, served promptly and efficiently.  We started with the fried pickles which were okay but a little too salty.  The ranch dressing was yummy though.  Everyone got something different...some burgers, some wraps, some salad, some wings, etc.  I tried the veggie burger in a pita wrap and it was great!  The sweet potato tots with honey butter dip were amazing.  It is pretty hard to go wrong with that but they really were excellent.  We weren't offered dessert so I have no idea if they have a good dessert menu but everything else hit the spot.  The pimento cheeseburger was a crowd favorite as well.

The gravy had lots of great flavor and it was a ton of food. My only negative was that the veggies were too oily. My lips were coated in oil. Other than that very good.

For those that haven't had buffalo food this comes in a pretty good second! The service was also fantastic.

We arrived a bit before the dinner rush (just after happy hour ended) and did not wait long for a table. The atmosphere inside Lebowski's reminds of my favorite neighborhood bar from Ft. Lauderdale; it looked to be filled with local regulars enjoying the end of their week.   Ordered the medium buffalo wings for an appetizer and they were the best part of our meal! I would like to try some of their other flavors next time. I ordered the two slider meal with the buffalo chicken sandwich and the cheeseburger, garlic fries as my side. The fries were amazing.   The sliders were much smaller than the waitress made them out to be (I had asked her how big they were). Normally a slider meal will come with 3-4 sliders at that size, but this one only had 2. For $3 more I could have ordered another slider, but still $10 for 3 small mediocre-tasting sliders is a bit much.   Our waitress was attentive and our beers were refilled in a timely manner. I would go back to try other wing flavors and for the fries.",

From the garlic fries to the jerk burger, this place nails their food.    This is a great place to kick back and watch a game and put down a couple White Russians or beers.  Decorated with a hommage to Buffalo sports teams and The Big Lebowski, it's tough not to love this place.    The service is quick and friendly without helicoptering.  I'll be back!  Try:  The garlic fries as your side",

I had this on my list to try and the recent burger battle in the Observer had gotten me in the mood to try out some of the best burger spots.  I ordered a cheeseburger with pepper jack and the standard setup.  It comes with chips, but I opted for the fries for an extra $0.99.  The had a nice list of beers and I went with and OMB Copper.  My food & beer made it out pretty quickly.  When the server brought my food he also brought ketchup & mustard.  The ketchup was cold from the fridge, which I like, but that is unusual.  So a plus for cold ketchup.  The burger was done medium and was juicy.  The lettuce and tomato were fresh.  The fries were crisp on the outside and creamy soft on the inside.  Overall a very nice burger an fries.  The best in Charlotte?  This was my first stop at a burger place so that remains to be seen.  The servers did a good job of helping each other.  Which was good because my server was \"getting her butt kicked,\" as she put it when she checked back on me once.  I had to wait quite a while for my check and for her to run my credit card.   It was busy, but no where near being swamped.  That was unfortunate and I hope she was having a bad day.  The food was a 4 the service was a 2 so I have to give them 3 stars.  I will try Lebowski's again just to see if that was a bad day or par for the course.",

It was wall to wall people standing room only while we waited for a table to open up. The drinks were reasonable and the food was great. Ate and drank well while watching the game. The serve did an awesome job making sure we had everything we needed even though it was busy. They gave you tickets if you hat bills gear on to win prizes from the restaurant during half time which is a great perk. The fried pickles were crispy and perfectly seasoned. The comb-nation is a great mix of 2 favorites 6 wings and a slider. The slider-nation is if you cant just pick 1 slider because they offer so many great ones. The greek chicken pita was packed with chicken and the spotted puffs were tasty too. For the price you can't go wrong with a good meal and the atmosphere adds to greatness of this restaurant.",

    "text": "If you wanna feel like a local, visit Lebowski's.  Not to say that this is a True \"locals\" spot, because it's really not, but it just feels that way. Some nights it feels like you're on an episode of Cheers, where everybody knows your name, although it may be your first time stopping in. Even with their lit up sign prominently displayed close to East Blvd., Lebowski's can be extremely easy to miss. It's not a big place, but it's got big heart and character.  The wings...don't miss out on these wings. I have had the wings here at least 20 times and they never mess them up. Their sauces are phenomenal and every wing is cooked to perfection. With all of the Buffalo, NY decor and considering they used to make the pilgrimage up to Buffalo to participate in their annual wing competition, Lebowski's knows wings.   Other notable items: burgers, any of the sandwiches, fries, and of course the infamous chili-mac. I have never dabbled with their entrees except for the smothered chicken, but I'm sure they offer some good dishes in this area. The drinks are pretty standard. If it's artfully crafted cocktails you're after, think again, but if you want a good moscow mule you're in luck. Their draft beer selection is limited, but is always made up of at least 2 or 3 solid choices.  The service is typically solid and would meet most people's standards. It's a small venue, so it's hard for your table to be forgotten. Prices are fair; nothing too crazy here. If you are in the mood to go somewhere casual for a damn good sandwich, visit Lebowski's. For everything that it is, it's done extremely well without trying too hard...a solid 4.5/5.",

Thankfully it's walking distance from the hospital so my brother and I made our way there several times, one for lunch and another for dinner. It's one of his favorite places in the area.   Parking can be a challenge since the lot is small and parking hard to come by in the immediate vicinity on East Blvd. it also gets very crowded here. We opted to sit in the outdoor patio out front even when it was a little chilly since the inside is pretty cramped. Even though they have heat lamps outside we were told they can't use them since it's some sort of fire hazard. No biggie, I'm from Chicago so it didn't bother me. I preferred sitting outside since the inside smells a little like a wet damp cloth.  Both the hostess and staff are so friendly. Our server was kind enough to card us, which happened to be a few days after my birthday, bless her soul. Obviously I had to have a White Russian from their drink menu dedicated just to The Dude's quintessential drink. Both The Stranger and The Lebowski Caucasian hit the spot.  We tried the Trio Dip Platter which came with Spinach-Artichoke, Pimento Cheese, and Hummus, along with a good portion of pita points, crostini, and tortilla chips for dipping. It's a great way to start a meal and perfect for sharing since it can appeal to a variety of tastes. For entrees I had The Fredonia with the 'Weck (Kosher salt and caraway seeds) added to the grilled panini bread. It was so good. The roast beef and provolone with the accompany au ju was au so juicy. The 'Weck elevated it to the next level. Just the taste and crunch from the seeds added to the flavor land. texture profile. Also upped my side order to the garlic fries. They were good but not as crispy as I'd hoped. Brother had the Maude's Meatloaf which he's had before and said was great.  We went back for wing night during the week. The Garlic-Parm wings were great. The garlic fries were better this time around. Looking forward to the next visit when I'm back in the neighborhood.",

It is one of those places where you could order a drink and a meal, get nostalgic and talk for hours with your friends. Our waitress was friendly but did seem a bit anxious about getting orders right. I got the burger with a side of homemade chilli. The turn around time was quick and the burger tasted okay but not the best. I may have to come back here and try out a different dish.

Server told us the owner was from Buffalo which explains all of the Buffalo Bills flags and Western NY School pennants.  We drove down right after Church. We were originally looking for another restaurant and we could not find it, decided to go with what we knew was good.  Walked in about 11:30 and basically had the place to ourselves but that changed quickly.  Our server was very attentive. My wife ordered Unsweet tea which I questioned how sweet the sweet tea was. She brought me a sample and it was too sweet so she ended up mixing it half and half.and she did that throughout the lunch.  My wife order the Smothered Chicken which she has ordered before and she liked it.  I had the Fredonia.  Starts out as a French Dip but time you put it on a Weck Rolls with Caraway Seeds and horseradish it's closer to a kimmelweck which make since considering the Buffalo Connection.  Excellent choice since that is one of my favorites.  I actually glad we could not find that restaurant because lunch today was great and I finally got a changed to write a review of it.",

The atmosphere itself transports you back to New York, it has that same feel with the sports memorabilia and friendly faces. The hot wings here are top notch, nothing like the southern take on NY wings- these are legit. You can tell by the buffalo sauce alone that they know what they are doing with the wings.   My only constructive criticism would be with the fried fish. As yummy was the wings were, the fish had left me wanting more flavors. I felt as though it was fried far too long and lost most of its natural flavor as my fish tasted like breading instead of haddock.   Overall, we would return here to get that feeling of being home again. Yummy brews and more wings are going to be my order next time- see you guys soon.",

    "text": "Charlotte has some very heavy competition when it comes to wings.  Go ahead and Google \"Best wings in Charlotte\", and most every site will have Lebowski's listed towards the top.   In my quest to hit every wing joint in CLT, I finally found myself on that side of town.   I wanted to see if the hype was real, I wanted to confirm what other Yelp reviewers had confirmed, that this was one of the Wing Mecca's of CLT.     So 3 star is for service, both my wife and my orders came out wrong and getting the server back to rectify the issue was a chore.  They were not that busy, so I am a little confused as to where the server vanished too.    My wife ordered the Buffalo Chicken wrap, but  instead of Buffalo sauce, she asked for the Stinger sauce (sweet heat) - the dish came out with neither sauces.  Also, why is there an up charge on this dish for fries?   Chips suck.  $1.29 up-charge is ridiculous.   Kudos to them for having a Yelp check-in offer that covers the cost.   But really, chips?    My gripe is I ordered wings with blue cheese and it was served with no blue cheese.   I know right?  Come on......I also ordered my fries tossed in the Garlic-Parm dry rub, that was missed too.     I went with the Buffalo Trifecta.......  But I really was here for Wings!!!!!  Okay, better than average.   Are they top ten, possible.   Are they top five, I could make a pretty strong argument that there are better wing spots.   But, in my view, as a True wing connoisseur, I find it baffling that they only offer six flavors.  Maybe they feel they have \"dialed in\" the basic flavors?   I dunno.  I went with the Garlic-Parm.   The dry rub was excellent, the wings perfectly cooked, not over crispy.     Just to confirm, the WINGS ARE EXCELLENT.   It was just not as earth shattering, to die for - I gotta drive all the way back to this spot to get my wing-on perfection.  A few other random comments for you, if you even read this far down:  The Haddock fish is fabulous, I would go there again and get this as a main dish.   Many reviewers have Yelped about the Haddock, my stamp of approval, white flaky with a perfectly lightly battered breading that is not fishy tasting one bit.   As of matter of fact, I was just in London for a week, and Lebowski's can hang with any of the Brits Fish n Chips.  Again, as many of the Yelpers commented, the Beef on Weck was tasteless.   I found it ultra bland.  There are better choices on the menu, just saying.  French fries are very good.  Ultra crispy.   Yum...   Great choice of local craft beers, six taps with two rotating.  It is definitely a cool, really great place to relax with friends.",

Also, I was a tad selfish and wanted to come here because the reviews of the wings are A++.   The parking lot is small, so if you drive a large vehicle I would suggest going somewhere else for parking during high peak times. The building is small but the inside was very clean for a pub like restaurant!  First I ordered fried pickles. And oh my goodness were they tasty!! They came out super hot and I couldn't help but eat them up because they were so good! Definitely recommend them! A guy who isn't a big fan of pickles tried them and he liked them, with ranch though.   I ordered the 6 buffalo wings and garlic fries. If you get regular fries your doing it wrong. Other people got the gold rush sauce.. I tried one.. and I really wish I would've gotten that sauce! It is described as tangy-sweet but it wasn't super tangy. Oh how tasty it was!! Can't go wrong with classic buffalo though.   The other guys got the Lebowski burger and said it was amazing. I didn't try it but they said they would be back to get it again. Finally, a guy got the chocolate cake. Wow! I had two bites and it was very satisfying!!   I didn't catch our waiters name but he was bald and a really great waiter! Other waitress help with refilling our drinks. So ultimately all of the staff was nice, patient, and always ready to help!   All in all, I was thoroughly satisfied with my experience for lunch today! I can't wait to go back! Also all the other guys (8 of them) said the food was very delicious and even they would come back on their own!! And some of them live a good distance away! I recommend it for sure!!",

I've only had to wait a handful of times, though, so it works out. They are swamped on Sundays during football season as Buffalo Bills fans swarm the place.  Their wings are delicious, (Jeriyak is my favorite, following by gold rush and stringer sauce) they get 5 stars from me. All of their sides are also on point, including their garlic fries & their sweet potato tots.   Aside from their wings, I've had the Jerk Style Burger, fish tacos & buffalo chicken wrap. All are pretty decent, nothing out of this world. I definitely would recommend the wings over anything.",

Good beer selection with about 10 regional craft beers on tap and another 20 bottles available.  As others have indicated they have good burgers and wings.  I like some of their low fat choices as well: veggie burger, turkey burger, and panini(s). The chicken florentine panini is as good as any sandwich that I have had in Charlotte. The current menu does not list the panini(s) clearly, but they usually can turn their veggie and turkey sandwich s (as well as some others) into an panini, which is excellent.  Parking is tight, but the next door retail locations close at 6:00 pm, and it is seems fine to park there after 6:30 pm.",

This is a great place to go for dinner, lunch, a quick bite, for bar setting, and for us... football.  This is owned by Buffalo NY natives and keeps True to the tradition of Buffalo.  I don't now of a better Beef on Weck in NC than at Lebowski's.    We were lucky last season when our Chicago Bears played a ton of 4pm games after the Bills.  If you are a Bills fan, there is no better place to be on a Sunday.    We also would recommend the Veggie Pita (which we get in a wrap vs the pita) and the burgers.  Monday is 2 burgers for $10 and 1/2 off wine.  Killer deal.  I believe Wednesday is 1/2 off wings.  Salads are also very good.  Becoming one of our very favorite bars in Charlotte.",

Even though I had lived in Upstate NY for a year I actually heard about Beef on Weck from here, not Buffalo.  Now I make sure to get it when I go back up there, but I like Lebowski's Beef on Weck and Lebowski Burger.   The place caters to the northern transplant crowd and is packed when the buffalo football and hockey teams are playing.   There is a full menu of white russian type drinks.  The daily specials are usually a good deal too.  My biggest issue is the parking lot is almost always a cluster.",

We usually park over at Wine and Design and walk in order to not have to deal with the traffic on East Blvd. It is an easy walk and on sunny days the King of Pops stand is out and he can be an excellent after dinner treat.   I digress a little. We (I say we because it can be between 2 and 4 ladies) usually walk in around 5-5:15 and the place is consistently empty, beating the after work crowd. We are seated immediately and check out the drink menu.   On Tuesdays they have $5 Stoli vodka specials and assorted beer specials (this past time it was Fat Tire drafts for $3). However, True to form I always get the same thing Stoli orange and Sprite. **They do list $5 martinis on their website on Tuesdays - wrong - it is Thursday.**  I also have always gotten the Fredonia dip with the horsey sauce on the side because the taste of horseradish is very prevalent in the sauce. It basically a roast beef sandwich with au jus. But way more than \"basic\". The sandwich is grilled on a delicious bread on a panini maker and comes out fresh and hot. I've also partaken in their spot tots ( sweet potato tater tots) and their garlic fries. I prefer the garlic fries which they make fresh from the fryer every time we go.   The waitress is always very nice and very quick. The staff help each other out so everything you might need (extra sauce, silverware, napkins, etc.) is always at your fingertips. I don't really see us going anywhere else for dinner before painting, despite there being other options like Cantina 1511 and JJs Red Hots, this place is just that good.",

We were greeted warmly like they really cared that we were there. The atmosphere was just right for a neighborhood bar and grill.   Our server was super.  Just the right mix of efficient professionalism and friendly helpfulness.  She helped us select a couple of our favorites from the old days; The beef on a weck and the fish fry.  They are every bit as good as they ever were and maybe even a bit better. The portions were perfect for an evening meal.  The price was very reasonable.

I went with my roommate, and introduced her to some of the food I grew up on!  I chose the \"Taste of Buffalo\" to get a taste of it all.  It included wings, a haddock fish fry (the only fish to fry in my opinion) and a beef on weck slider as well as french fries.  As an extremely picky wing eater, I have to say that the wings reminded me of home...I opted for just \"hot\" which is classic for Buffalo.  The fish was on the smaller side, but was tasty, and they have it every night, unlike at home (usually Fridays only).  The beef on weck was also delish.  Only downfall- we had a coupon but found out it was only valid on certain nights.  Lots of Buffalo Bills stuff inside....felt like home!    My rommate got some sort of sandwich, and also really enjoyed it.  There was a dip on the menu called \"The Fredonia.\"  My sister went to school at Fredonia, so I took a picture of it on the menu and sent it to her!  She got a kick out of it for sure!  If you are an upstater, as a lot of we are in Charlotte, check it out, I don't think you will be disspointed!",

But from that point on, it was a DISASTER; we waited close to 20 minutes before anyone came by to even give us water or utensils (while every table around us was clearly being served appropriately). Once someone actually took our drink order, the wait staff FINALLY came over and attempted to take our order; the server was very fake and aloof and came off with the \"why are you here?\" attitude (we did notice that we were the ONLY people of color in the bar at the time) To give some credit, the food order did arrive quickly and the food itself was fair overall, but the service and the experience was the worst I've experienced in quite some time and we will don't be going back ever again!!

    "text": "Lebowski's isn't really the type of place that I'd normally stop at, for a couple of reasons.  First and foremost, because I don't get down East Boulevard very often (though I should - more and more places are cropping up that make it interesting).  Secondly, because it's a smallish place that looks a bit more like a pub than a grill, and in my advancing years it's just not where I'd stop for a bite to eat, which is what I'm more after these days than a drink.  That out of the way, when we had an unofficial Yelp gathering the other evening, I'm glad that it was chosen to be at Lebowski's, or we might have missed this hidden gem.  The night started off right with the service.  Amy greeted us right away (well, after Dave S. and Joseph L, but they don't really count, as they aren't employees), introducing herself, asking our names and perhaps most impressively, using our names throughout the time we were there.  Not often that you see that happen these days.  Nicely done!  That was followed up by a creative menu, serving the aforementioned sliders so that you aren't cornered into a single choice that you might not like.  I chose the beef on weck, burger and pulled pork.  They arrived with an impressive array of condiments, but those were scarcely needed - the sliders stood well on their own.  The weck roll doesn't seem to be quite an authentic weck roll, but I'm not an expert, and it serves the purpose well enough.  I probably could have done with another order of sliders, but I saved the extra room for one of the several varieties of White Russians (hey - a place called Lebowski's, and you aren't going to order a White Russian?).  Altogether a pleasant experience, and I'm glad we made the choice.  Parking was also ample, which can be an issue in this area of town.  The only downside is that it's not a larger space (that, and for some I could see it being more bar-like may be an issue).  For our group neither was a problem, but I could see where one might be for others.  I also wish that I had ordered the garlic fries instead of the mac and cheese as a side.  Very tasty (I sampled someone else's)...",

Lots of TVs, and has covered outdoor seating for people watching and enjoying the upcoming fall weather. Our waitress was so friendly it was actually making me paranoid. She legit seemed concerned if we were happy or needed anything, which is a change from South Florida. Refills were spot on. Get the wings and the chili....dude!  This is also a great family friendly place, our 2 year old was given a small bucket of good quality crayons and a coloring kids menu that wasn't exclusively crap fried kid food.   Only downfall, parking is minimal, but not worth a penalty to the restaurant.",

My cheeseburger sliders were a bit dry, no extras (lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce, etc) - forgettable. Sweet potato tator tots were cooked correctly, but not much additional flavor to them to make them stand out. Service was excellent, hostess efficient and friendly. Restaurant was cold, so a bit uncomfortable. To be fair, the hostess tried to seat us at a high top table further in due to the cold, but we didn't want to \"be on display\" and asked to sit at a regular table. Pictures of other dishes on Yelp look good, so maybe I picked the outlier.",

Beer selection is extensive, and red wine by the glass is 8 bucks, with several good choices.   The service was friendly, but it was pretty relaxed. If it was lunchtime, I would have dinged them for it, but it was just fine with me as I wanted to watch a few sporting events.

    "text": "...As some of you may know, I took a short hiatus from writing reviews.  This break was due to some negative feedback I had received from restaurant owners, but mostly because I was busy with work...  ANYWAYS, after much prodding (thanks Ben!) I'm BACK, and I'm back to close out 2013 with a slew of the best reviews from around the QC. What brought me back, you ask?  Simply put, THE DUDE, and the wings they serve up at Lebowski's...  Two buddies of mine had been encouraging me to give Lebowski's a try.  I was told Wednesday was the place to go because of their half-priced wing special on Wednesdays.  As I had this past Wednesday off from work, I decided this would be my virgin foray to Lebowski's.    Parking:  There is plenty of parking located behind Lebowski's.  I am not sure of the relationship between JJ's and Lebowski's, but you could also probably park on the JJ's side of the building as well.  No parking issues at all, which is always a plus.  Ambiance:  The first thing I noticed upon entering Lebowski's is the darkness.  Though I went there around lunch time this past Wednesday, the place felt dark and somewhat dreary to be honest.  One would think that with such connections to the Big Lebowski, it would be a bit more lively inside.    Service:  We were greeted by the one person that was working the entire bar.  She told my friend and I, we could seat ourselves where ever we wanted.  Our drink and food orders were taken fairly promptly.  Though our server probably had three to four other tables, her service was still very much on point.  Our drinks were refilled promptly, when we asked for an extra ranch, one was brought directly to us.  Food:  As I stated above, I came here on Wednesday, looking to sample the wings I had heard so much about.  So of course, I ordered a batch of 10 goldrush wings which did not disappoint.  The wings had that rare combination of being well-cooked yet still tender.  The meat on the bones was very tender, and fell off the bone with with every bite.  The wings were PERFECTLY sauced.  There's nothing worse than a dry wing!  The ranch was thick and cold, just as it should be.  My friend ordered the buffalo-style wings and was also satisfied with wings.   I've only been to Lebowski's once and I've only had one thing on the menu.  Nevertheless, the wings, and service were excellent and I'll be back.",

This Bar/Restaurant does not disappoint.  Even though this is a Bill's bar and I am not a Bill's fan we were welcomed with open arms and even offered food recommendations by the locals.  The wings are True to life Buffalo Wings.  I have all applause and no complaints.  The flavor was amazing.  The texture was amazing.  The time to table was amazing.  The wings were to the table in 3 mins.    We ordered the fried Haddock for our main which arrived moments after I grabbed the last wing.  It was among the best pieces of fried fish I have ever had to include 4 and 5 star restaurants.   I did the garlic fries as a side.  Again some of the best flavors you can get from deep fried potatoes.    I was able to sample the Cole Slaw and the roast beef sliders.  I was not impressed with the flavor of either as for me I have had better.  For me the wings, fish, and service make this place super amazing.  P.S.  if your driving through get some wings to go.  I did not and I wish I did.",

I've passed by there before and seen a good number of people on the patio but when I went was surprised by how little the inside was. I could see this being a good bar too that's not too loud and where you don't have to keep shouting \"What??!\" to someone when trying to have a convo. The menu had a lot but nothing was really screaming out to me so  I got the Jerk style Gardenburger with garlic fries (I love how you can sub meatless or turkey in the burgers) and it was pretty tasty with attentive service. The garlic fries could've been more garlic-y as I like enough to keep the vamps away.  I hear they have an awesome happy hour from 4 to 6P each day so I would love to check that out as I love anything cheap. Edit anything cheap involving the sauce. I had a good experience but it's not one of those places where I would tell people they have to try. I would like to check it out again to see if will be more memorable.",

However, it could have been a niche/theme restaurant only if it weren't for the great food and excellent service. The wings are great-I like them extra hot and these are not but they taste great. Sliders were wonderful. Beer selection proud and reasonably priced. A variety of White Russian specials (Caucasians) that were tasty too. The place is decorated with some original TBL themes art-some of which they were willing to sell. Amy was our server on both visits and she was one of the best servers I've ever had in a restaurant and went above and beyond for us. I would go back as a fan of the Dude if it wasn't good-but if they completely dropped the theme i would still be back any chance I got for the food and service. I just wish I lived closer.",

The roast beef on weck was truly delicious and the garlic parm wings were the perfect combo of flavor and crisp. If I lived here this is the kind of place my family would come and also order take out. As a side aren't cats usually uncomfortable in public? This cat here is clearly very happy. That's a five star review that stands out!!",

    "text": "Despite the continual infusion/intrusion of trendy new restaurants all around it, Lebowski's Grill & Pub just continues to do what it does best, which is to serve up decent burgers and chicken wings. There's absolutely no pretense, inside or out, about this neighborhood favorite. Most people will either love or hate it. Its cramped interior defiantly shows its age and parking can be pain, which is why this suburbanite decided to go for an early lunch.  I tried the 10 count wings, half Buffalo style and half Stingers, for $10.79. They were tender, meaty and tasty as advertised. I followed those with their popular Jerk style burger, which was topped with pineapple and peppers. It only included chips but otherwise it was made with top quality Angus beef and served on an egg bun. It was tasty, but at $9, I would expect a little better side than slightly stale chips. My friend had the Supreme Burger, and although also good, we both agreed that we were biased after enjoying one of Charlotte's best burgers another historic bar and grill the day before.  Sanitation score was acceptable at 94.5 and the service was attentive and friendly. Fountain drinks at $2.29 each were filled regularly. Overall, we found the meal to be slightly better-than-average, but I admire it for what it is, a simple neighborhood bar that reflects pride of ownership. Although it's not on my Gotta Try list, I'd definitely stop by again if I were in the area for a burger or a brew.",

We were looking around the ole internets for some good trivia in the area and we found Lebowski's consistently making people's lists towards the top of the ranks. We decided to give it a shot.  We called ahead to get a reservation on Tuesday night with no trouble at all. As soon as we got there, they cleared a table for our group and sat us no problem! The menu had a bunch of things that looked tasty, which is always nice because you can get something and still want to come back to try some other things! There were a few specials on drinks (beer under $3, $4 white Russians) and some on food, too.  I opted to go with the *award winning* wings and was not disappointed! They were great. Not too spicy, but sauced up enough and crunchy. I got a side of pasta salad and although I'm not a huge fan of olives, the pasta and peppers part was delicious.   On to the trivia! My friends and I from DC played a lot of trivia up there, and really wanted to find a good spot in Charlotte. We nailed it on our first try. I forgot the dude's name who does the questions and answers there, but he was fantastic. It went at a good pace, and didn't last way too long like I've seen some trivias before.   Bottom line, if you're looking for a good trivia outing and some good food to accompany, Lebowski's is your place!",

First time around I ordered the Haddock Fish Fry and was impressed at how delicious it was. The seasoned fries were delicious, the fried haddock was crunchy and flaky, and the homemade tartar sauce was just outstanding.  Big shout-out to the wings, which I got on my second visit. They really sauce them up and they are fried to perfection. The drink specials are great too, with $4 white russians every single day (and they are damn tasty) and $3 Fat Tire pints on Tuesdays.

They do not have much seating, so I would recommend calling ahead to reserve a table to ensure that you can play/have no wait. They also have T.V.s if you are wanting to come here to watch a game.  The trivia is challenging but very fun! They have great drink specials as well. I ordered the $5 Titos special with bloody mary mix and it was very good.   The main reason I gave Lebowski's a five star is for their JAW DROPPING chicken tenders and garlic fries. Ask for them with their stinger sauce, it will CHANGE YOUR LIFE. I never thought I would think this highly of any chicken tenders personally, but these are fit for a King. They are cooked just right, very juicy and tender. The breading is perfect as well, not too much bread or too crispy/crunchy. The stinger sauce makes these chicken tenders even more incredible. It is a sweet and sour/buffalo/siracha blend mix (I think). It adds a depth of flavor which you can only dream of.   The garlic fries are also perfectly cooked and seasoned as well. Would highly recommend switching out the side for these.   Would definitely give this place a try if you haven't!",

Have never been and heard great things about so many menu options we ordered a varity of items, including, wings, haddock, beef on weck, mashed potatoes and gravy and salad.  First off, the salad was simple, but very fresh. As for the wings, the best I have had in Charlotte. We got medium heat and it was perfect for my liking.  The haddock, OMG, loved it!  Great white fish with a light batter and a flavorful tartar sauce. My least favor item was the weck on beef. That may be because I am not a huge beef eater, but I thought it was just okay. And, they forgot our au jus so that may have helped. Overall great service, food and we will definitely be back.",

I sat at the bar and this was one of the best bar experiences I've ever had.  The bartender explained the draft beer selection and their specials on Carolina Craft brews.  Yay!  4 of the locals were represented including Triple C.  :)    Anyway, i had seen the pictures of the food on Yelp and pretty much decided on what I was ordering from those - Fried Pickles and Beef on Weck.  The pickles were advertised as the \"Best on the Blvd\" and that's probably True.  I don't know of any other places on East Blvd that even serve them.  But the slices were big and they were decent.  I like Alexander Michael's better though.   The Beef on Weck was amazing.  The weck itself was the best sandwich bread I have ever tasted.   I ordered the garlic fries with it and they were tasty with a subtle garlic flavor.     As for the venue, it's not very big and I can see this as a great neighborhood bar.  Service really shines here too.  This place is definitely worth coming back to!",

Sure, the wings, nachos, fries, fried pickles are ALL excellent, but we go here just as much for the SUPERB fried haddock or the DELICIOUS, FRESH, & ORIGINAL SALADS!  Beyond that Lebowski's is family run & EVERY employee treats you like family.  Great weekly lunch and dinner specials, one of my favs is Wednesdays when wings are 1/2 off and bartenders pick of beer is just $3 (you give them yvour preference and they pick something in that wheelhouse ... FUN!).  You also can't beat a place that celebrates the classic The Big Lewbowski! Top it off, the white Russians and specialty white Russians are AWESOME (bunny toes and nutty Walter being my 2 favs)  Lebowski's gets my highest recommendation for the WHOLE PACKAGE ... the menu, the drinks, the atmosphere, the staff, and the attentiveness to bar fare done excellent!",

Had the jive burger I think that's the name, comes with diced pineapple and tomatoes, and pepper jack cheese. Cooked perfectly. I also had a side of wings, due to the fact that Wednesday is half price wing night, so why not. Had them tossed in the honey mustard sauce. Although for me a bit too much sauce, they had a great flavor, the chicken wasn't over cooked like it can be with wings.  They have tons of beer on tap, along with a good wine selection. I would recommend this place over some of the top rated Charlotte eateries any time. Great place to dress down and enjoy the evening.",

Especially since they've been having Living Social coupons like crazy... man I love a good deal.   My boyfriend and I can't get over how a little dive bar like this has such outstanding quality food! As much as I still love the veggie burger and garlic fries here, I've totally fallen in love with their SALADS! My favorites? The Spinach (Organic baby spinach, feta cheese, red onion and dried cranberries) and The Mission Bay (Garden greens, tomato, roasted corn & black bean salsa, sliced avocado). I order both of these with a vegan patty on top and the CREAMY CILANTRO LIME dressing... best dressing ever!   My boyfriend is not a vegetarian like me, but doesn't eat as much meat as the average omnivore, he usually orders a veggie burger instead of a hamburger. But he's totally fallen in love with the quality of the Certified Angus Beef Burger here at Lebowski's.   This past Friday we came here with a Living Social coupon, so we wanted to try out an appetizer and we were particularly jonesin' for nachos, but the Niagara Street Nachos are the only ones on the menu and are centered around grilled chicken.  But no worries, I simply asked our waitress if they could make a vegetarian nacho plate... and MAN OH MAN the chef brought on an epic order I couldn't believe. Tri-color tortilla chips with queso, shredded cheddar, grilled spinach, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms and a side of salsa. WHAT? This blew my mind.",

We obviously had to get the wings and we were in luck--Wednesdays is their wing special. 6 for $6.95 or 10 for $9.95 I believe. Unfortunately, they don't let you split flavors so we got 6 with the Stinger sauce and 6 with the Jerkiyaki. We loved them. I preferred the heat of the Stinger sauce, but both were great.   We also got the Roast Beef on Weck sandwich (with horses sauce and au jus) and the Lebowski Burger. I loved the Roast Beef with both sauces. We all agreed the burger was just ok. We got garlic fries as our side (free if you check in on Yelp!) which I loved.   There were three of us and we split everything which worked out well. The service was friendly and fast.   The wings are definitely some of the best in Charlotte. I definitely recommend checking this place out if you haven't already!",

The parking was very tight but we were able to find some. I was told there would be a 25 min wait for 2 but it may be less which was fine. They really have no waiting area as the restaurant is pretty tight so we just stood. We actually ended up waiting for only about 15 mins.   I got 10 of the stinger wings and a order of the garlic fries. Honestly, I was more in love with the fries then the wings.. but the wings were really good too. The fries were just seasoned so good and were so crisp I wanted to eat the crumbs. In terms of the wings I think the flavor which was basically sweet + heat could have been balanced better. To me they tasted more of like hot wings didn't really get the sweet flavor. They were cooked well though.   I think the service was great and the food was good. Didn't knock my socks off though.   Would recommend for game day food and a chill relaxed atmosphere.",

I order my to-go wings from here on game days because I think the price for the amount of wings you get is a great value. I also think they cook the wings really well -- they're always extra crispy, which is how I like them. They even give you more than 2 sticks of celery, which sadly is all that Hickory Tavern gives you.   The fried pickles are really good but very salty, so make sure you have plenty of water.   Service is good but when ordering to-go it can be quite loud inside and hard for the staff to hear you.",

Pleasantly different from the usual franchise Grills. The staff greeted us before the entrance door could hit our heels. Although it was crowded, The hostess sat me and my partner in minutes. We had the option of sitting indoors or out. We sat indoors. I ordered the House Salad w/grilled chicken and my partner ordered the Chicken Pita. We were also able to order wine from a large selection on the wine menu. Our food came out in a timely manner and It was fresh and delicious. The portions were much larger than expected. We were completely satisfied with our meal. While there we had the pleasure of meeting the kitchen manager, Chef Kevin and also the New Owner Paul. We had a pleasant conversation about the updated menu and his plans for renovating the restaurant. Paul appeared so excited about he and his wife Merediths' plans for the future. Paul shook our hands thanking us for dining and welcomed us back.  I am definitely naming Lebowski's Neighborhood Grill a top contender in Charlotte for a fresh tasty lunch and dinner spot. With a Full bar, indoor-outdoor dining, televisions, great staff, delicious fresh food, and a relaxing atmosphere you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I've come here twice now. The first time was for Wednesday wing night and the second was on a Monday afternoon for the Breckinridge Salad. Yes, I came here for a specific salad.   Wing night was enjoyable and I had the Weeping Willow Wit to accompany my wings which was delicious as well. My husband and I sat in the bar area and were not rushed. Service was decent and we said we wanted to come back. Unfortunately, life got busy and so this visit was a while ago.   When I came for lunch on Monday, I asked to be seated outside because my companion was bringing a puppy. I was told the patio was closed unless you had a dog, and I found this to be very strange. As someone who does not have a pup, I'd be upset if I wanted to sit outside, saw others outside, and was told I couldn't because I don't have a dog.   As for the food, I ordered the Breckinridge salad, buffalo style with grilled chicken and the hard boiled egg on the side. I also ordered a side of sweet potato tots thanks to so many Yelp reviewers insisting on heir deliciousness!  The salad was delicious and enough to fill me up without being stuffed. Avocado would be a welcome edition to this salad. My companion ate the hard boiled egg and seemed to enjoy it. The sweet potato tots were tasty but not cooked evenly. That was the only flaw - some pieces had harder mini \"chunks\" of sweet potato while others were crisp. The dip served with the tots was a cinnamon sugar dip, so delightful I could've licked the container clean. But I didn't.   I'd like to come back to Lebowski's for wing night again soon, and I think this could become a local spot for us when we just need to get out for quick, tasty food and a drink. We've talked about going here more often than we do, but maybe I will have to change that soon.",

The wings weren't too soggy and not too messy. Just right .   The servers were polite and made you feel welcomed. The food came out pretty quick too. The noise level wasn't too loud to have their location as a meet up for a quick lunch meeting neither.   Btw.. idk if they're the best wings in CLT but they're damn good!! Top 5 Top 5",

It was here that I got a beer that was super good! Son of a Peach. Urgh, I wonder if it's in the west coast but I really liked this beer. Food wise, it's average. And maybe that's what sports bar food is all about. Their wings were on the drier side even though it was dripping in sauce. The breakfast burrito was a bit on the bland side. I think we came during a Bills game? There was only one television for non-Bills games and we were sharing it with other fans.",

But a friend told me recently to try the Blackened wings add buffalo, so pumped for that on my next visit.

    "text": "I'm a fan of the movie, the Lebowski Burger and Gold rush wings. Great place to grab lunch or dinner or late night snack. It is a sports bar and it can get boisterous but I like that atmosphere every now and then. The lighting in the evening is dim, which can make a night out with the hubs seem romantic until I get Gold sauce all over my fingers, but not so dark that you struggle to read the menu. Seating is sometimes limited for large parties, but we never had a problem with 2 or 3.    We come here once or twice a month and  I oscillate between the Lebowski Burger (Angus burger topped with roast beef and queso on a weck roll) and the Gold wings. Definetly a Yankee thing to have to pay extra to swap chips for fries or any other side but not a deal breaker. The garlic fries are good but I usually try to order a salad when I get the Lebowski Burger.   'Dat burger. Mmmm. 'Dat burger. So thick and juicy! I think the caraway seeds and salt on the Weck roll is what sets it above all other burgers. Or it could be the queso sauce. I keep saying I will try the beef on weck or some other entree but I haven't had the willpower yet. It calls to my soul and I give in almost every time.   Wings. Yup. They know what they're doing. Gold Wings are a sweet, spicy tangy sauce and the wings are perfectly crisp. I could eat 20 by myself. Okay, maybe 30 if I was starving and had no haters dining with me, but I usually split 10 with the hubs for an app.   They have daily specials (I always want to come here for the Monday Date Night special - 2 burgers for $12 - but we never seem to make it over there).  We've been for the Wednesday Wing special before (1/2 price wings) but I probably will never do that again. I have a lack of self control around chicken wings.",

It was crazy they told us It would be about an hour so we decided to try this place. This was by far one of my favorite restaurants of all time! I can say the blew bad daddy's out of the water!!!! I've been a vegetarian for almost 16 years and really the only thing I can find out to eat is veggie burgers. You could substitute about any chicken or meat on the menu for hot Buffalo Cauliflower Bites. I had a buffalo cauliflower wrap and It was my favorite food of all time! My husband loved the wrap and he's a meat eater. Our waitress was so nice and It was a very relaxing spot. We ate outside and It was quiet and we could actually talk and enjoy ourselves! I can't wait to go back. We live about an hour away but It worth the drive and the prices are great too. I am so glad we found this place.",

The menu is small enough to have options but not so large that they cannot maintain quality.  I had the beef on weck and my husband had the sliders. Both options were great, but I won hands down with the beef on weck.  The roast beef did not have any chewy (gross) bites and the bread was ahhh-mazing!  The garlic fries were perfect as well.  Now to the best part...the service.  Jen was our assigned server, but everyone seemed to check in and take responsibility for the customers.  Jen was truly outstanding!  She was so personable and gave us great recommendations for other restaurants to try in the neighborhood.  When the food is good, the atmosphere is good, and the server is GREAT.....we will be back time and time again.  I would give this place more stars if I could and I will have to pace myself so that I do not burn out on it!",

I recommend trying the trio dip. There homemade pimento cheese dip is on point. They also have a nice little patio outside.

I try not to say that somewhere has the best anything, unless it is True... Lebowski's has the best wings you will get anywhere.  The owner, Kirk, is from Buffalo and he knows his stuff.  They cook the wings the right way, using fresh chicken wings and he puts them on the flat top to help crisp them up.  You won't be able to eat BW3 or any other crap wings ever again without comparing them to Lebowski's.",

Our drink orders were taken immediately, but the waitress took forever getting back to us for our meal orders. Had to wait another eternity (or what felt like eternity because I was starving) for the food to come. Had the garden burger veracruz style with a side of mac n cheese. Burger was not bad but not super memorable because I was already on the verge of forgetting I had eaten it the moment I finished devouring it. Mac n cheese was nothing special either, but plus points for using curly macaroni that held in more cheese than elbow mac. My friend got their \"Legendary Wings\" and thought they were delicious, but not legendary. Not a place I'd have cravings for, but still a solid neighborhood bar.",

This definitely fits the bill for a neighborhood bar.  It's quite a cozy and friendly place.  The food here is excellent and they have quite a bit to offer for vegetarians.  I love the pimento & cheese burger which, like all of their burgers, can be made vegetarian.  The outdoor seating area is shaded and covered and a great spot to be on cooler evenings.  They have quite a few micro brews on tap, including the Charlotte-brewed OMB (Olde Mecklenburg Brewery), Two-Hearted Ale, and Fat Tire among others.  The owner is a music fan and you can see some of his extensive album collections on the walls.  The only addition is that they need a bike rack in the front.",

They play some alternative music, which I have never heard in a bar before. The service is slow, even with there not being many people at the bar/ restaurant. I honestly expected there to be a whole lot more people there on a Football Sunday. The cool thing about this place is that they support local breweries and that is always a plus for me. That in itself almost brought them up to 4 stars. The food portion in my book was kinda small. I had what everyone recommends the \"Beef Weck\" it was really good and the Au Jus sauce was excellent but again too small and to pay an additional .45 cents for a dipping sauce to me is just crazy. Also, I guess that this place in a Buffalo Bills hangout spot with all of the memorabilia and the Flutie Flakes? I will be going back again when I am in the mood for a nice low key night with not too much going on. The food was ok and the drinks were fine. I believe that this is a everyday kinda bar for the normal type of person. Just like the name entails \"relax... man\"",

Been out to the Lebowski-fest, had myself a bowling league based around it, and simply can't get enough of watching it.  The movie really is a cult classic. I feel that it is a fantastic restaurant \"theme\" that this business pulls off very well. If you are a fan, you need to come and check out this place. Its not just the name of the restaurant that attracts, but the decor as well. Very nicely decorated interior with all sorts of related memorabilia.   The food options are broad, pretty generic, but overall VERY good (for what I've tried, to date). You won't find any fancy movie quotes/ names on the menu other than the Lebowski's Burger, which by the way, is also pretty damn good. Beer selection is also broad. The outdoor seating is great in the summer.  Overall, an absolute great restaurant/ bar, and would definitely be the dude's local hangout joint.",

It looks like they may have Wii games too...since there was a Wii system hooked up to one of the tvs.   They have limited vegetarian options; however, the veggies nachos and the veggie burger were pretty good.

I on the other hand see it as eclectic...they had some Bob Marley playing and of course The Dude plastered just about everywhere. The Sabres banner didn't hurt either (I'm a UB grad ).  The bathroom was clean and overall the restaurant was tidy.   Food- I loved the B-lo touches. Franks, Sahlen's, Weber's...they've got it covered. I went with the Fredonia; a beef on weck of sorts served with horsey, melted provolone, au jus, pressed like a panini in a hoagie (sprinkled with caraway and coarse salt). I loved the au jus but I like my horsey straight on horseradish(y) aka much spicier. I will say their garlic fries were some of the best I've ever tasted. I splashed those suckers with malt vinegar and I was in heaven. My other half got a fish fry, he didn't seem too thrilled about it and he is pretty easy to please. He mistook the  beer bottle for the malt vinegar and still ate the fries though,that's how good they were!   Drinks- They had a special running that day, Monday $3 bartender bottles choice (meaning the bartender chooses a new beer each time). They weren't Miller Lite's and we were able to give a little direction on our choice (We were given Pilsner Urquell and a Ranger IPA). No complaints in that department : )   Service- We had a younger gentleman serve us, and he did a great job. He was very upbeat and friendly. The food came out super-fast (like how'd they do that ? fast)   Just a tip, they have another Monday deal two burgers for $10, I'm sure we'll return to get some of those with plenty of the delicious garlic fries.",

There are three words I am thrilled to hear upon walking into this place, besides \"pick a table\" and that is \"BEEF ON WECK.\"  It in itself is worth the trip.  Roast beef sliced thin and piled high on a weck roll, fresh made roll with course salt and rye seeds, it is out of this world.  Before going to Buffalo way too often in the past I had never heard of Beef on Weck and once my wife and I decided to move to Charlotte I thought I would never hear of it again.

I haven't found a $6 burger this good anywhere else.  Although getting fries will bump your tab up $2, it's not pretentious but not too low-brow either, like some other places across the street.    They have drink specials to boot.  On Wednesday's it's the only $4 Jack & Coke in the neighborhood.  The dirty rice was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned.  Burgers are juicy and even their pulled pork gives serious barbecue joints around town a run for their money.  Avoid the apple pie dessert, it's definitely pre-packaged/frozen, but maybe some of the other desserts are better.  Shocking really, how many trixies were in here on a Saturday night but I think that will cure itself eventually.  It doesn't present itself as that kind of a bar and should attract the right kind of people in no time.  I think I just found my new favorite place to eat in Dilworth.",

I ordered the Jerk burger, while my husband ordered a burger that had roast beef on top. The jerk burger had a really great taste and I enjoyed the toppings on it. I paid extra for fries instead of chips and noticed right away they were cooked to order. Some places serve fries that even though come out hot you can tell they have been sitting under a warmer. This was not the case at Lebowskis. My husband enjoyed his burger. First time having roast beef on top. He did say he wished there was more roast beef but the burger itself was pretty large. We also had a grilled cheese kids meal and a slider meal on our menu. I really loved how there was an option to mix and match sliders giving the option to try more than one kind. My children seldom finish their food and we always have left overs, this didn't happen dining at Lebowskis. Restaurant was kid friendly especially with the football game going on. The inside is slightly small so the tables are close together but my kids were really well behaved ( thank goodness) so this wasn't necessarily a problem.  Service was great, food was made  quickly and our drinks always remained full. Price was average for a family of four especially since the food was great. Will definitely return when in the area!",

There is also a fabulous Groupon deal right now, get on it! I don't like the fact that the parking lot is kind of a mess, very inconvenient that there isn't a second or larger exit. (Docked half a star.) We parked in the back but luckily were able to back out before running into trouble. There was Bills stuff everywhere! I'd love to watch a game here sometime, I'm sure they would have great specials.   Luckily, we were able to find a couple of bar seats right away as it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be at 5:45p. We ordered a couple of the $4 house White Russians which were $1 off...it was really strong at first but it tasted great..very comparable to melted Thrifty's ice cream..yum, my childhood. But beware, there is a TON of half and half in them, not diet friendly at all. We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip and tacos (1 chicken and 1 haddock). I enjoyed the spinach artichoke dip, tasted better than the dip offered at Crave. It also came with fresh tortilla chips and mini garlic toasts. I didn't like the tacos as much, there was way too much cabbage slaw that had a overpowering horseradishy/vinegary after taste. (Docked a star)The salsa was also on the sweet side but I didn't mind, I thought it went well with the fish. The chicken was well seasoned and juicy, I'd order this again and tell the server to have the kitchen go easy on the slaw.   Don't worry, I'm sure this rating will go up after I get my hands on the wings or battered fish plate. We will be back for more.",

    "text": "Ever go to a restaurant and get met by someone with a sour face and a surly attitude? That won't happen at Lebowski's. If there's one thing I notice every time, and as my husband will tell you, COMMENT on every time, it's how friendly everyone at Lebowski's is.   We first tried Lebowski's after my husband heard about the authenticity of their Buffalo wings. The owner is from Buffalo, I believe, and it IS the Buffalo Bills bar in Charlotte. I went a few hours out of a trip up north just to have wings at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, so my husband knew I'd be on board with trying a joint known for its authentic wings.  We visit Lebowski's most often on Sunday around midday. Football games are on the television, and the routine is pretty much the same for me. My husband mixes up his orders, and his beers, depending on what they have on tap. I'm a horrible beer drinker (Bud Light, I consider it my karmic punishment for drinking so much beer) and a sucker for fish and chips, so that's what I get every time. Oh, in addition to an order of Buffalo wings.  The first time the server asked me if I wanted the \"junior\" size fish and chips, I asked her what she thought, since I'd never seen the serving size before. Fortunately she told me it would be fine. I have to wonder what the \"full\" size fish and chips is like, because the \"junior\" size takes up a massive plate!  The food is delicious. The environment is a million kinds of awesome, with the \"Dude\" theme going in full force. And as I said, the people who seat you, take your orders and bring your food are so nice I might invite them to Thanksgiving dinner next year.  \"Neighborhood grill\" describes Lebowski's perfectly. We live several neighborhoods south of Lebowski's, but are willing to make the drive every time we come here. Some Sundays I just wake up and mutter, \"Lebowski's?\" to my husband when I first see him. It's just that good.",

And when you do, get the garlic fries. Amazing.   Place was a little dark but it kind of fits the mood. Posters and pictures of The Dude are everywhere so if for some strange reason you're not a fan of his, you might want to avoid this place.   I got a burger with garlic fries. While the burger was good, the garlic fries hit the spot like none other. It's an extra dollar if I remember right but it's worth so much more.   Of course I had a White Russian with my meal and it was on point. Not much to complain about at this place.",

She would disappear for long stretches of time. The wings that we had as an appetizer were really good and they might be worth giving the restaurant a second chance!  We both had sandwiches and they were not good at all. Thought that the menu was typical, and honestly if the menu is so small then the items on it should be outstanding. Other than the wings that we had, that was not the case.  If you're in the mood for wings I think give it a shot! If you're in the mood for anything else... Look else where.",

I'm very picky about other people's meatloaf because I make some awesome meatloaf. I mean that's all I know how to cook beside steaks. I enjoyed most of their sliders. Their cheeseburger, haddock and coleslaw and of course the meatloaf and gravy sliders are some of my favorites!! As for the wings. I like the Gold Rush and the Jerkiyaki are my go to.  Customer service is alway great. Can be a little off when it's crazy pack. The parking sucks at times. You can't make reservations. But other than that, I will continue to come back for those sliders and wings!",

Staff is cool and the whole vibe is just so laid back. It is all table seating (+ of course the small bar) & the dining area is very open.  ...This time I had a Greek salad w/ grilled chicken. It was humongous and sooo good. Sometimes when a place throws some chicken on a salad, the chicken is so bland, as if just for the sake of having it on there. Here though, the chicken actually had flavor.  I also had some of the Trio Dip Platter and it was equally de-lish. (And) very well could have served as the entree.  This is the type of place where you wanna get what you had the last time because it was so good, but then again wanna try something else because it all looks so appetizing.  Here, I would say it is pretty safe to experiment a bit. They seem to know what they are doing and aren't stingy about it either!",

I've been searching for great wings in Charlotte for years and I've found them.  They do them the buffalo way and they are delicious.  The beers were cold and the staff was friendly.  The owner and his daughter were behind the bar and were very friendly and conversational, if you like that kind of thing.  I got french fries with my wings and they were on point.  The blue cheese was over seasoned and not enough crumbles for my liking, but still enjoyable.  I would give this place 5 stars, but the only thing they're lacking is their TV situation for sports.  I scratched my head when I heard that it's the biggest Bills bar in the Carolinas when I saw they only have two small out dated TV's behind the bar.  Nevertheless, next time I have friends in town and we're in the mood for wings, I'm taking them to Lebowski's  The owner told me the meatloaf is worth coming back as well so I'll try that next time.",

Completely laid back. And if you're from Buffalo, you'll fall even more love with this place. You'll find things like Beef on 'Weck and chicken finger subs on the menu. They're a Bills backer bar.   Lebowski's has a ton of daily specials. Lunch, dinner, drinks. They even do a twice a day happy hour. On Wednesdays, wings are half price all day. My favorites are the gold rush and good ole buffalo style sauces. Ton of burger and chicken sandwich options on the menu. I love that there's a slider nation section with a combi-nation: six wings, one slider, and fries for $11.95. The garlic fries are delicious.   Other odds and ends: Trivia on Tuesday nights. The patio is dog-friendly. House White Russians are four bucks every day. The parking lot is a little awkward and can get crowded.  So, who wants to go eat wings now?",

The atmosphere was comfortable like any basic neighborhood bar.  The outside patio, is outside.  The place needs more TVs and although regulars and locals go here, it felt a little bit congested inside.  It had a nice rug that tied the room together.    All of the food were spin offs from the movie for the most part.  However, I chose the Jerk style burger and like honest Abe, I can't tell a lie.  It was wicked good.  The jerkiyaki glaze, pineapple and pepper- jack was more on point than a German Short-hair.  I don't know if it's because I ask for a medium cooked burger or if it was from all of the sauce but the bun was a little soggy like a Cherri-o left in a cereal bowl.  But I ate every bite. Take note, the chips are from a bag you'd find in a pantry and not housemade.  Lastly the White Russian.  Oh the White Russian.  Like a keystone in an arch, without the White Russian to lean on, this place would crumble.  But my God, the White Russian here are something out of a dream.  The Dude would be impressed and proud.  Best White Russian I have ever had and best in Charlotte.  I recommend going here strictly to try it.  Overall, Lebowski's is a very chill, easy- going, laid back, average, neighborhood bar.  Probably won't change ever and everyone is happy the way it is.  I recommend going there with the boys for a burger and of course a While Russian.  But if you are trying to watch a game, not the best option.   Once the service gets started, it's not half bad.  Thanks for the White Russians Lebowski's.",

It's been impossible to replicate down south...but these. These are damn close. Good prices, great service. We brought our dog who we also usually order food for (I know. it's absurd. We are those people.)...and I was going to pay for an entire kids meal or something and they offered a better solution since I guess we aren't the only crazy customers who do this. The food was even served in a dog bowl!! I did not request that but she loved it! I hope the chef doesn't get offended by cooking for a dog because we thought every thing was fantastic and it just added to our experience. Thank you Lebowskis!",

    "text": "Like the movie from which this bar takes it's nominal inspiration, Lebowski's is fun, quirky and surprisingly substantial. It's a neighborhood bar, where you can easily feel like a regular on your first visit. The staff is friendly and attentive, even when the small dining area is packed.  The menu consists of typical bar fair.  They don't try to elevate it, or reinterpret it.. Just do it really well. The wings are said to be the best in Charlotte, which I can't argue.. They are really good wings. I enjoy the Carolina Gold Rush, a mustard-based sauce.    There seems to be drink specials every day.. At least there have been every time I visit. My favorite is Mystery Beer Monday: you tell the bartender what you like and he/she will pick something for you. What a great way to try new brews?!  The Lebowski inspired artwork livens the environment. If only there was a bowling alley!",

It is accompanied by homemade fries & slaw, however you can substitute sides.  Other sides are garlic fries, side salad, Mac & cheese, as well as more.  I had a side salad with their Greek dressing.  The Greek salad dressing Was the best! It has feta cheese in it.  My other side was the slaw.  It has a strong horseradish taste which I didn't care for, but my husband loved it.  He ordered the fish as well, with garlic fries that he thoroughly enjoyed.  We are in the covered patio.",

    "text": "I LOVE the wings here, unfortunately, I don't love the pricing structure and enforcement of it.  I had first visited a few years back when searching for a great wing restaurant (ECW has some delicious and interesting flavours but doesn't always deliver on quality and doesn't hit the basic Buffalo flavour too well) in the Charlotte area. I entered the establishment on a crowded weekend night, and saw that it was full, so I approached the hostess. I told her that I wanted place an order for two 10 pieces to go and she offered that the 25 wing order that was cheaper than two-ten pieces.  I took her up on the offer and in the meantime decided to eat my wings there (minimal service, which was to be expected on a carry-out changed dine-in).  All was well said and done.  I have ordered take-out on several other occasions and everything has been great.  This past Sunday I had promised to take my Mom to experience her best \"Buffalo Wings\" experience yet; Stateside outside of Buffalo. We arrived, navigated the difficult and misleading parking lot, and walked in, to be greeted by the typical [upfront] friendly service and seated within minutes.  We were quickly seated but then after 10 minutes, several employees started to look concerned and started asking if our drink order had been taken yet (it hadn't), and going off to find other employees to rectify it.  Finally someone offered to take our drink order at the outside patio (a water and an unsweet tea) and said that if she had to, she could take our food order.  I was introducing my Mother to the \"deliciousness of the wings from Lebowskis\" as I had learned to love them which meant I needed a 25 wing order to fulfill the duty of my eating them along with my Mom (we ended up eating 7/7 of a 10/10 order).  She loved them but the fact that a wing restaurant can't cater to special wing orders (such as the 25 wings for $20 for a middle aged lady and her son) speaks volumes about the mindset of the owner.  i started this review as five-stars, briefly dropped it to four, and then got angry about how the establishment doesn't exercise discretion amongst its patrons (aka a Mom and Son couple is different than 12 frat 'bros' when ordering wings)...  Discretion is key and it lacks here, but the food is delicious...",

I usually get a fish plate, or the chicken wings, which are some of the BEST in Charlotte!  The Burgers are of course delicious, and the plates are plentiful.  They have a good selection of draft beers and a full bar with a variety of signature drinks.  It's just a great place all the way around and we hope it sticks around for a long time.",

At first when we passed, it seemed like they were closed. We walk in and they were eager to see us since we were their 1st customers of the night.....at 7pm.  The restaurant was is pretty small, but it felt comfortable. We get seated and put in our drink orders (and my drink was never empty! It would get down to about 3/4 full and our waitress would bring me a new one). We order the hummus dip as a starter and despite the fridge taste, it was pretty good. I like the flat bread better than the chips they serve.   I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap in a tortilla and blue cheese. As a side, I get the mac n cheese which was outstanding. My husband ordered the Beef on Weck. He didn't like the amount of salt that was on the bun, but he said overall it was very good. He also got the mac n cheese and that's all he would talk about. We split a spinach salad that had red onions and cranberries. This was a refreshing addition to our meal.  The only thing I didn't like is they didn't have the NFL network, instead they had NHL because the owners were from Buffalo, NY. I highly recommend anybody to stop by here, it's a great place to eat and have a few drinks.",

The jerkyaki wings are by far the best wings in Charlotte. The Beef on Weck is also another great item and again blows away the other competition that carry that same item.  If you are a white russian fan, this is a great place as well. I highly recommend the Bunny Toes, basically a white russian that tastes like melted mint chocolate chip ice cream! It's amazing.  There seems to always be beer specials as well!    The restaurant has a great laid back feel with about 20 or so tables inside, a nice bar, and then a great patio outside with about another 8-10 tables.  The service is always great as well. Very nice wait staff, food comes out quick, and the owner(s) on multiple occassions have checked to see how everything is and to just thank me for my business.   I will recommend Lebowski's to anyone looking for a great place to eat or just have a drink at a cool neighborhood bar!",

The chili nachos had very little cheese - and it was that runny cheese-whizzy stuff.  The chili was also on the sweet side, and not to my taste. The burger was decently priced but overcooked.  The pulled pork dinner was a small pile of shredded pork on top of a huge pile of mac 'n cheese.  Unfortunately, the mac 'n cheese was also made with that runny cheese.  Portion sizes were decent, but when the food is not that great, what's the point?",

The beers are usually reasonably priced but the specialty drinks tend to run at a bit of a premium. The menu has a good variety to choose from and while it does amount to pretty much just your run of the mill bar food it is priced very well and makes eating there affordable. Good beer selection as well.  Don't expect a sprawling restaurant when you go there. It probably only comfortably seats around 60 on the inside and 20 on the patio. However, this adds to the neighborhood bar feel and along with the friendly staff the patrons themselves tend to be on the friendly side as well which is a nice change.  The service at Lebowski's is really top notch and the servers are very attentive. You can tell all of the staff enjoys working there and that in itself can really add to the quality of any restaurant.   I would recommend it to anyone looking for a laid back place to enjoy a affordable meal, play some trivia on tuesday nights or just want to sit back and enjoy a pint.",

First, i've always loved \"The Big Lebowski\" and love a good (or even a cheaply made ones at home) White Russian. Second, just before we got our food, a parade of douschery took over the patio area.  You know the kind of people that are just annoying unless it is you and your friends, then they actually seem funny and fun.  The patio area is nice with a good amount of seating and cornhole and some bowling pin game i didn't get to check out. It seems like the cornhole cramped the area a little bit once the patio got the big crowd and maybe should be put up until after dinnertime.   The Lebowski Caucasian was pretty good, but i can't say i would pay $9 again for it. i believe i saw $2 Coronas for the months of April and May.   i can't say the food was outstanding, the wings were good, but not the best. The Buffalo beef on weck was better than the wings and would definitely be my recommendation. I had never had it before, It is really just a \"roast beef sandwich on a salty kummelweck roll.\" i do love pretzel salt and bbq so i would probably get that again with some beer.   We liked our server although we could have used him mid-meal for some additional bbq sauce.",
