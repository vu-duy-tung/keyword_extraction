I used to frequent this place because they had a $7.99 (now $8.99) hibachi lunch special - 30 min in and out .  Or so they claim.    First of all, Kabuto almost never fulfills that 30 min promise.  Nope- usually more like an hour and I've been late getting back to work several times because of this.  Don't make promises you can't keep, it hurts you more than it helps.  Especially in the era of social media... shout-out to Yelp.  What else.  The hibachi lunch is extremely inconsistent depending on who your \"chef\" is.  Now I'll admit, some of them are pretty good and when you're lucky - you'll get an awesome meal for a pretty damn good price.  But from my experience this usually isn't the case (I've had the \"express\" lunch about 20 times now).  My meal was complete garbage today and I'm finally done giving Kabuto another chance.",

The server took our order and never came back.  We ordered a few rolls and they slowly started coming after a 45 minute wait. The manager apologized but very insincerely. I believe he is a sushi chef and certainly lacks management skills. The final roll came 50 minutes after we first ordered and it was wrong not once but twice.  Very disappointed and will be hesitant to go back - at least on a Sunday night with an inexperienced staff.",

My boyfriend and I got acquainted with some of the waitresses & staff- Lisa is great and so is the chef with the butcher knife tattoo lol. But, unfortunately the past few times have been horrible.. It's either a hit or miss with them. The chefs should all be trained to cook the same way but it seems as if some are lacking essential skills. The food has been bland with no seasoning or taste during the past few visits, I then reached out to management and they replaced our meal for free. Great, except it is STILL tasteless. I would only recommend going here if you know your chef is up to par.",

    "text": "This is my favorite hibachi place. When we started going to this location over 3 years ago, we only went once in a while for a nice fun dinner. Eventually, we learned about their express lunch special which made it affordable for us to go a lot more often! For the express lunch, you will get smaller portions than you do at dinner, but you're paying less, too. I, for one, love the express lunch portions because they're perfect for me! I can rarely clean my plate of all of the food at a full dinner. As with any place, you never know who you're going to get as a chef. Some of the chefs are laid back and fun to casually chat with or joke with while they prepare your food. Some go through the motions of the showmanship and some simply come, cook, and leave. I will admit that the express lunch service hasn't been as efficient lately as it's been in the past (it used to be seated, orders, food, check, out and now has a lot of down time and waiting). Sometimes you'll go a while without a drink refill which is a bit of a pain with how small the glasses are and how much ice is in them. Sometimes it gets difficult to flag someone down. You can still be in and out in about 45-60 mins which isn't bad for a freshly-cooked lunch mid-workday. We hope to be checking out the fairly new express dinner next week as we'll have family in town who will be on a budget.  Tip: If you get your salad with ginger dressing, hold on to your bowl when you're done and dip your meats in the ginger dressing. It's tasty.  Tip: Chopsticks and ginger dipping sauce must be asked for. You will only be provided with one sauce instead of the two that most other places provide.  Tip: If you are having trouble flagging someone down, (nicely) tell your chef what you need. The waitstaff are quick to respond to a request from the chef and they're usually a lot better at getting the attention of the runners.",

I found a buy 1 get 1/2 off coupon online and brought it with me.  It was pretty empty at 5:30 on a Wednesday, so no trouble getting a table and we were sat right away.  Our server was nice and he got our drink order and soups our right away.  Had some mai tai's to start, sooo strong it took me the whole dinner to drink mine.  we all pretty much got shrimp and it was fishy, should have gotten the jumbo shrimp which is what they used for the shrimp appetizer.  Everything else was pretty good though, love the veggies and they give you noodles in addition to rice here.  I only wish they did the sprouts here, I love sprouts!!  Our chef was done really fast since we had all shrimp and 1 rare steak.  The server at one point asked whose birthday it was and then that was it, not even an offer if any of us wanted dessert, just gave us the check.  No big deal since we were stuffed, but different from any other Japanese steak house I've been to where they usually sing and give a complimentary dessert.  Oh well it was still a decent reasonably priced meal and the nephews love it so I'm sure we'll be back for her bday next year!",

I've never received an order of sushi from the chef, in either take-out or at the bar service that wasn't followed up with friendly care and conversation.  I even feel guilty that I can't recall his name tonight.  In today's post-modern chill, Kabuto staff works to keep a neighborhood feel at the sushi bar, and congenial conversation if you're looking for it.  I've always been pleased with the sushi, as well as treated to a few of the chef's off-menu creations every once in a while.    To most establishments the art of service is lost, here it is practiced with Eastern respect.",

This place is mediocre at best, the tofu was ok, a little blane. Disappointed in the miso soup, it had this weird taste that I can't quite place. The sushi was pretty good for the most part. Almost everything had cream cheese in it, I do not like cream cheese in my sushi and had to ask for it without. The server took forever at first but was friendly; the sushi chefs were very nice and friendly as well. I probably won't come back to eat but it was ok to try at least once. I just know better sushi places. They had a crappy and small sake selection and their cheapest bottle was 18. I didn't even bother to get anything; I love sake and I always get it. Most of the time I can find something I like but they just had such a little selection of nothing good. Also I had to get a new soy sauce bowl. The one I had was dirty. I feel you should pay more attention to that. This place is ok. I don't know how the dinner part is but after my experience I have low expectations of it.",

The kids had a ball, and very soon their troubles were far behind them.  Our chef made them laugh, and they devoured their meal.  Truthfully, I've had better Hibachi.  It was really good food, but I have had better in comparison to other places.

My family and I have frequented Kabuto for years, but it has deteriorated so significantly we will never return.  The restaurant is run down, and not cleaned thoroughly.  On our trip tonight my four year old asked why it smelled bad when walking in the door.  The quality of the food has substantially gone down while the prices have increased.  The vegetables on the hibachi were not done at all, while the steak I ordered had a rancid taste.  When I complained the \"owner\" started raising her voice at me in front of my young daughter and three other family members screaming that she would not allow me to say the steak I had been served was spoiled.  There is a reason this restaurant is having to run specials on a large plastic sign out front, and why the last time we visited there was only one other table in the entire restaurant.  It is very sad to watch a once good local establishment run into the ground.",

    "text": "I remember coming to Kabuto and the chefs would actually entertain you - no matter how old you are. Nowadays, you can't get them to smile at you. I went to lunch with my mother earlier this week and we were appalled at how bad the customer service was. They close at 2pm and as mom and I walked in at 1:15, the hostess assumed we would have the express. We told her we were having the regular hibachi. Little did we know, she would sit us down with a group that had already ordered their food and the chef was just starting to cook! There were plenty of empty seats on the other grill, and not to mention, since it was only 1:15 of course there were more patrons coming in! The chef had to stop what he was doing several times to ask the waitress if she could take our orders, and help out like she's suppose to. That is not cool. Also, if it's 1:50p and you have patrons coming to your restaurant, you shouldn't have to hurry them out of the door either. I don't like being rushed through my lunch so that you can have 2 or 3 hours to clean or do whatever you do before dinner. When 2:00p rolls around, just lock the door and as patrons leave, just escort them out and lock the door as they leave. It's that simple. We do it all the time in retail. I would give Kabuto at least a 4 rating, but I would highly recommend that they work on their customer service first. Hopefully, when I see better results from other patrons on here, I'll be back.",

She tried for about 25 seconds to be pleasant and apologetic, but then her willingness to make her customers happy wore thin.  She harumphed and threw her hands in the air while saying, \"We made a mistake.  What do you want us to do?\"  Well, I definitely want you to learn how to act like a professional.  We declined being seated amongst the party in the large room and took one of the tables in the middle of the dining room.  The place was shabby and the floor was filthy.  I mean, I typically wouldn't notice, because I'm not looking at the floor, but it was noticeably dirty.  The food was average.

I'm not a sushi expert in any sense, and their menu is fairly large, so I ordered from what I was already familiar with. Maybe next time I'll ask to learn more about the menu. Anyway, I do know that I ordered one roll with yellowtail, one with softshell crab, and an order of edamame. I'm not a picky eater and this was my first time trying both, but I wasn't crazy about flavor of the softshell crab. However, we sat at the bar where the sushi was being made, which was a neat experience, and the chef was very friendly and made sure we enjoyed what we were eating. Our server was always available, and our drink glasses were never empty. I look forward to trying more sushi at Kabuto!",

    "text": "Well it's not the place it use to be. We went there for my birthday per the kids request and we had the typical experience which was a lot of banging, a lot of yelling and a lot of fire. I can understand why kids love this place, me not so much. I use to enjoy their food back in the day but now you don't get nearly the amount you use to get and what is with \"Japanese Katsup?\" That stuff is nasty. Didn't they use to give you two sauces? I had to ask for something different and truth be told that sauce wasn't much better and the chef seemed upset with me when I told him I wasn't a fan of the Japanese Katsup. Dude get over it and go make your ring of fire.   The food was MEH. Miso soup which really was chix broth with a little (and I stress little) sliced scallion and 2 thin slices of mushrooms, a salad which was Iceberg (BLEH) and their famous Ginger dressing, which I do admit, I like.  The entrees were MEH as well. I had the fillet, scallops and shrimp. My husband had the fillet and lobster. Our steaks were cooked perfectly but I think the chef was upset at the seafood because he MURDERED it. Every piece of seafood was so overcooked, it was like we had the fillet with rubber bands. I understand you want to put on a show but can you at least do it with the zucchini and leave the seafood be?  That evening my son and I had some sushi as well and I will say the fish was VERY fresh. Had I known the chef was going to incinerate my entree, I would have just stuck with the sushi.",

My waiter was relatively inattentive (and spoke limited English), and thus, got my order wrong; thankfully, everything is made in front of you, so this was fixed and I enjoyed my filet and lobster as ordered. That stated, this place is just too loud (and I'm eighteen, so that says a lot), and the service feels rushed.  My suggestion? Go to the Nakato down the road.",

    "text": "First off, I never leave a review for any restaurants, good or bad.  This is my first and most likely last review I will post on yelp.  I come to this place pretty regularly.  My office building is just about a 5 minute drive away.  I always place my order online and then pick it up, super convenient.   I have never had an issue with this place until today.  The food here is fine and usually the service here is fine too.  However, today was a totally different story.  Unfortunately, this review will be about the terrible customer service, rather than the food.  I placed my order online at around 11:30AM and the pickup time was 12:05PM.  I arrived about 5 minutes early around 12:00PM and told the waiter that I was there to pick up an order.  He nods and goes into the kitchen, comes back out and speaks to another customer, apologizing about the wait.  He did not give me any sort of update about my order.  He proceeds to ask the 3 other people if they would like a drink while waiting.  He did not ask me the same question.  He proceeds to give everyone else their drinks and gives them an update about their order.  Again, he skips over me.  After about 5 minutes of this waiter running in and out of the kitchen, he finally looks and me and asks if I would like a drink while waiting.  I tell him yes and what I want to drink.  Instead of getting my drink, he runs back into the kitchen to check up on other orders.  About 10 minutes later, he realizes that he never gave me my drink and apologizes.  He proceeds to fill my cup in front of me, but leaves it on the bar and goes back into the kitchen.  After a few more minutes, he finally puts a lid on the drink and hands it to me.  During this time, more customers come in wanting to pick up their orders.  He proceeds to ask for the name on the order, asks if they'd like a drink while waiting, and proceeds to apologize to them about the wait.  He did not give me the same courtesy.  After about 25 minutes, I finally decide to ask who I assume is the manager, if he could check how much longer my food will be.  He gets my name and heads back into the kitchen.  He comes out a few minutes later and tells me that my order is coming off the grill and he walks away.  A to go order comes out, and the waiter hands it to this other lady who was at the bar before I arrived.  The manager comes back to the bar area a few minutes later and sees me still waiting, goes back into the kitchen and asks the waiter where my order was.  The waiter says he gave the order to the customer already, to which the manager points out that I am Nancy, not the lady who he gave the order to minutes early.  Again, no one apologizes or lets me know what happened.  It is now 12:30PM, I and now slightly irritated, so I ask for my money back.  I didn't want to wait any longer.  FINALLY, when I asked for my money back, someone actually apologized half heartily about the situation.  I eat here all the time, I never let bad customer service stop me from eating somewhere unless the food is terrible too.  However, I do not believe I will returning to this restaurant.  I have posted a note in the office break room about this place as well.  I was never upset about the wait because I understand that things happen and the kitchen can get backed up, nothing can be done about that.  However, I had never experienced such terrible service like this here or any place I have been to.",

The interior feels sort of uninspired, but I didn't notice that it was unclean. The menu seems a bit more limited than other hibachi grills, but there were still plenty of choices.  In the end, it was all pretty standard - watery soup, iceberg with ginger dressing (although they do give you the choice of ranch), veggies, noodles, rice and protein.  The white sauce was good.  No ginger sauce - that was disappointing!  The chef was fine, he was good with the kids at our table, but not as friendly with the adults.  Our server was excellent though!  She was very efficient and attentive.  For two of us (adult and one child), the bill with tip was over $40, which I am frugal enough to feel entitles me to a really great meal.  Kabuto was just okay though.",

    "text": "Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group.   This place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....  You can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse.   Service is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \"Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\" Pretty much always my thought process.   This place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented.   Thanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!",

It would be a great place to take your kids.  There were a lot of young well behaved children there enjoying themselves when I went there for dinner.  There is also a little Koi pond with a bridge that you walk over when you head to the Hibachi grills.    The quality of the food at Kabuto is about average.  One thing that was a little disappointing, was the portions.  Even though I was the only one at the table to finish their meal, I feel that at similar restaurants I have gotten larger portions.   Lunch time is a lot lighter as well, but for about $9 you get a protein and two sides.  They say that they will get you in and out in 30 minutes for lunch.  Sometimes this will happen and sometimes it will not.    Another thing I should mention is that I got a 22oz Kirin that was past it's \"enjoy by\" date.  Not far enough where I wanted to fuss but I would probably will stick to more common beers there (you would think that would be common).",

My thoughts in response to that are always, \"You clearly haven't had a lot of good Japanese food\". While I do enjoy Kabutos when I go, being one of the only choices in the area. I do not think it's that great compared to other Japanese Restaurants i've tried. For the most part I've ordered togo, but i've realized, you get more food when you dine in. They put egg in their rice which I don't really understand. And being that the Yolk of an egg is too rich for me and immediately upsets my stomach, I find myself always picking the egg out of my rice. I do enjoy that they give you noodles, which was new to me. The noodles are actually pretty tasty. The shrimp are small in comparison to what you get at other Hibachi restaurants. Also all they cook in is Soy Sauce. No other sauce choices. Ot at least none have been offered to me. The manager that they always get when there is an issue and seats people from time to time, is a bit short & rude when you're not kissing her butt. The wait staff has short memories. I am always constantly reminding them of something I asked for multiple times and it's hard to communicate with some of them as they don't understand good english. Overall, this place is just OK.",

We had to have two table to fit us all but this restaurant made that no problem at all. We had two chefs and two servers but everything went smoothly. They took our drink order as soon as we sat down and in afew minutes they placed our food order. Very fast service. Very kind and efficient service. I tipped the chef and the wait staff. Just so you know they have large portions. Even the small kids plate was filled. Their food was amazing but I couldn't even finish my plate. I had the chicken dish and it came with soup first, then salad with ginger dressing ( yum ), then he threw shrimp and cut up vegetables all around for bus to catch in our mouth, then he cooked on the grill, garlic noodles, fried rice, and everyone's meat. The chef was spectacular!!! Thanks to this restaurant the surprise party was out of this world!!!",

It is very romantic and fun at the same time. However I have never tried their lunch menu.   Today that changed. I ordered the shrimp with fried rice and noodles. I upgraded to the large shrimp for an additional $2.95 which I highly recommend.   Service was the only disappointment today. It seems might be a little understaffed. I waited over 5mins for a refill on tea which I rarely let go that far. Other than that the food was delicious and chefs great. The only reason for the 4stars and not 5stars was the tea incident. I will have to try them again in a month or so to give an update.",

Right when I walked in and asked for a table, I was turned away because a person from my party had to take a phone call and was in the parking lot. Rather than simply saying, \"oh I'm sorry, your whole party needs to be in the building\" the manger stated, \"that's kind of dumb to ask for a table, cause the experience starts right when you sit down\". Okay cool.  My missing person came in a minute later and the manager was no where to be found, and didn't show up until, I kid you not, 15 minutes later. By that time a party of 20 walked in through the doors and was seated before us.   Great food, bad treatment. Would have rather driven 5 more minutes to get to another hibachi style restaurant than be treated badly.",

Manager comes out and only apologizes offering nothing else. At this point I am not going to order anything else as everyone is more than halfway through the meal.  Manager gets 0 stars.  Table cook gets 3 stars as none of this is his fault. Server gets 2 stars and tried to redeem himself (maybe he put the order in too late as he was slow on a few other occasions) by offering his own personal sushi order he had in back.  Not sure where the blame falls the most, but sushi guy should never leave before all the table orders have been taken.  I guess lack of manager oversight.

We just didn't get a song despite our nine year old announcing it was his birthday.   Love the lunch concept of picking two sides.   Three of us had chicken and one order of shrimp.

    "text": "My first time and the Last time!  The first 10 minutes was fine, but the rest was a waste of our time and money. $85.00 in the toilet. Most everything tasted bland. Especially the rice, noodles and vegetables. Very little flavor in meats as well with the exception of the scallop.   We had reservations and were seated promptly. The three of us on one end of the table and a family of three on the other end. I was happy because when I'm the last one seated at a table I feel rushed trying to eat quickly trying to catch up. So we were waiting on the rest of the table to fill up. Next thing I know the other three are gone and just us at the big table. We did have our cocktails. They took our orders and two minutes our soup was salad was served at the same time.   At this point I'm confused. Where are the rest of the people at our table? All other tables were full and people were still coming in. I barely had time to taste the soup when the chef arrives to prepare dinner. I complained to deaf years. But I made it clear this was not what I expected.   No interaction with other guests. No fun atmosphere. I was looking forward to at least a little bit of entertainment. But instead a dull time while the full table next to us were laughing and having a blast!!!    The highlight of my night was clapping when they were singing happy birthday to another guest at another table. I was so angry. All I did was focus on my soup and salad. I had them half eaten when the chef (lol) started filling my plate with the tasteless food from the grill.   I tasted everything and that is all I could stomach since I was so upset. The other two people with me did eat their food and we left.   So I wanted to check them out and I did and they sucked so back to Nakato's Japanese restaurant. They are better.   If they plan to stay in business... Many changes need to happen.",

    "text": "So I will try to keep my emotions out of this review as tonight's experience is still raw. It was a party of 4 celebrating our daughters 14th birthday.  We ordered two appetizers. Hold that thought for later. Waiter ask what we all want. Before we ordered we mentioned that my wife is allergic to shrimp and she wanted to make sure that they cooked the steak and chicken before cooking the shrimp as we have had done many times in this restaurant, as well as other hibachi places. He had a very poor understanding of English, but after many attempts he seems to understand, and promised that her entire meal would be prepared out back.  As he got to my order I told him I wanted the combination of fillet and chicken. Do you want fillet? No. I want the fillet and in addition to the fillet I would like you to also add chicken. So you want the chicken? No, I would like for you to place the following order - the following two items at the same time..the first item being something called fillet..and the second item is something called chicken...and I would like for you to bring them out at the same time - which is called the combination platter of fillet and chicken!!! So you would like fillet meat, and some chicken? Yes! Yes! Yes!...as I'm showing him the menu and tapping with my finger on the picture of the fillet in the picture and of the chicken and repeating four or five or six times that I would like for him both with the hibachi chef, the fillet and the chicken. He smiled and nodded and I thought it was ok anyway since once the hibachi chef was going to come out I will just remind him. Fast-forward 15 minutes. The hibachi chef at this point starts prepping and we realize that we have no appetizers that we ordered. Everyone at the table - all  three families have soup and salad and they hibachi chef is starting to prepare the vegetables the rice and the noodles.  (I'll save another paragraph - we got our apps about 20 minutes after the food was already provided ) I asked chef if he knew that my wife had an allergy and that he was going to be preparing her chicken and steak separately. He looked confused and after 3 or 4 attempts to re-explain it to him, he told me that her food was being prepared in the back. I nodded and we proceeded to wait for the food to be prepared. At this point the chef wanted to go around the table and confirm the temperature of everybody steak.  He asked me how I wanted it cooked and I said medium. I also wanted to re-confirm for the 10th time that he also was cooking me chicken. I told him again that I was getting a combination platter which included both the fillet in the chicken. He said that he didn't have any chicken on my order!! I said that was a mistake from the prior misunderstanding so I was 100% certain that I wanted to order both the file in the chicken together. He looked confused again and I reiterated again for the 11th or 12th time that I was having the steak and the chicken. At this point the other family sitting in our hibachi table started laughing because they could not believe that I had requested something as simple as steak and chicken 15 times from two different people. After getting the uncomfortable not I guess everyone agreed that I was going to get medium fillet and my chicken. We waited for our meal to be prepared. So now at this point the  veggies, rice, lo mein are done, and he starts to portioning out the food to entire table. Now, bear in mind, that my wife still has an empty plate since all of her food for supposedly being prepared in the back kitchen. So she just sat there looking at everybody eating their own food. Now that the steak has been cooked everyone liking, the chef starts chopping and placing everyone's steak, including mine and  my kids - we all got a big plate of steak. We looked at the hibachi table to see what was left in there was a little bit of chicken and a bunch of shrimp. My daughter and I looked at each other as we contemplated whether there was enough chicken for two or three people since it did not look like more than a single serving. Our fears proved correct. The chef gave the entire chicken to my daughter and zero for yours truly! Now I will admit, I ONLY reminded him as well as the original waiter 20 times that I wanted both - I guess it was not going to happen for us!  After everyone started to eat..me without my chicken and my wife with zero food, I was livid. We looked and finally found a manager who was dumbfounded and and ran back and forth 3 times to realize there was nothing, ZERO, food being cooked for my wife! We ended up getting her food after we were all done eating our dry, under-seasoned, steak. This was by far the worst single disaster in a restaurant I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. They ended up comping us two meals (mine and wife's). Jeez, so nice of them!  I will never eat there again, and will make sure I do everything in my power to make sure no one else does either! What a joke. Stay away!",

Standard medium shrimp appetizer.  Clear broth soup.  House salad with ginger dressing too much dressing. Salad swimming in it.  New York strip.  Good. 2 ladies has jumbo shrimp.  Great. Other guy has New York strip & chicken.  Good. Really like fried mixed vegetables. We shared a variety of sauces.  Soy, ginger, mustard.  We had a good time.  Disappointed no Koi fish in pond to feed.  Sushi chef said they used all up for dinner that night.",

Apparently he didn't think anyone noticed...so he cuts my other chicken breast in small little DICED pieces to make it look like I received 2 breasts. What an idiot!! When I complained to the manager, he took over 10 minutes to come over to the table and the idiot chef was already heading back to the kitchen. When I pointed out the breast on the floor (yep! idiot chef left it there on the floor), the manager claimed it was there from earlier and was not part of my meal. Idiots I tell you.....IDIOTS!  And the carpet is filthy, bathroom has no heat...you can smell bleach while eating dinner.",

Well, I made a reservation last night for my MIL's b-day dinner and POOF... we were seated immediately upon opening at 5PM last night... the service and swift accommodation of families with reservations is to be praised.. and they really do a great job of trying to seat walk-ins too (from what I could tell)... BUT... there were SIX other \"happy happy birthday\" songs being sung around us as my MIL's was being finished... it was hilarious and became the joke of the evening... the space is so very loud with conversation that no sooner do you try to carry on the conversation than BOOM BOOM BOOM go the drums and another chorus of \"happy happy birthday\" brings down the house...  IN SHORT - the food here is excellent... the cooks CLEARLY enjoy what they're doing... the service is excellent, and they REALLY try to make 100% sure that you are happy, and that your food order is correct... BUT the atmosphere is super loud... so if you have family that's hard of hearing... just giggle and bear it... there's no getting around the noise here!    Can't wait for another birthday excuse to come back! LOL",

    "text": "Located on Highway 51 this Japanese steakhouse has always been a little 'less than ' in my opinion.   I've been a customer several times over the past 19 years always hoping maybe this time will be different and I inevitably always leave with the same feeling, \" it's not as good as the other Japanese steak house just down the street. \"  My latest visit is very typical of how I have continued to come to this conclusion.   I arrived at the restaurant for lunch and waited more than 5 minutes before any of the employees even greeted me.  I almost left.   A apologetic gentleman came from behind the bar area where he stated they needed help.   Once I got seated at a table that already had drinks, soup and salads I was asked what my drink ordered would be. Then immediately I was asked to give my lunch ordered. With no time to even look at the menu I ordered hibachi shrimp.  Can't go wrong with that.   I got a bowl of soup and a glass of water. No salad ever arrived. The waiter never ever again came back until time to get my money.  My water glass was empty and never refilled.  The hibachi Shrimp lunch was only 6 shrimp. Six.   The noodles weren't good and the fried rice wasn't either.  The hibachi shrimp lunch meal was 15.00.  Pricey for a shrimp lunch that had only six shrimp.   There was nothing else in my lunch that made the 15.00 lunch worth it.  Over priced and food that wasn't great along with service that was lacking.  A disappointment is my opinion of the entire experience.   No way would I go here again . Just \" not as good as \". the competitors just down the street. It was not even ... meh ... it was just   \"not good.\".",

However I found food, run of the mill so to speak. The iceberg lettuce salad had water in the bottom of salad bowl and dressing seemed old in my opinion. The clear soup perhaps chicken based was okay. My dining mate and I ordered the hibachi chicken that came with standard noodles, fried rice and veges. All basic but I had tastier hibachi food elsewhere. The chefs put on a nice show. Overall it was a nice experience  to be with friends but I would not return. We also found the wood floors very slippery in the dining room  even prior to our meal and wondered if the habachi grease migrated to the floor, otherwise the restaurant seemed clean as well as the restrooms",

It was way too much noodles and then they want to give you rice after that. I guess that's too distract you from the fact that you won't be getting much of your meat of choice. The shrimp I had was good. The upside is it's hot because it's right off the grill. The waiter was attentive and kept the drinks full. I would eat here again. Oh and definitely make a reservation to make sure you don't have too long of a wait.",

I researched low sodium Japanese ordering before coming and hoped Kabutos could/would accommodate.   Well not only did they accommodate me but they asked me questions about my preference for cooking my order and when I went to taste a piece of my hubbies steak the cook said \"be careful their is soy which equals sodium in that, just a taste\".   Thank you Kabutos for your amazing service and accommodation. Everything was delicious.   PS - I ordered the Salmon w/ steamed rice, veggies and garlic noodles. I even got my two shrimp appetizer on my plate which was brought out from the back where they cooked it separately. Thanks again   My family loves this place and so do I. It's always a good show and the food is delicious! My kids remember their first times here and it's always their pick for birthday dinners and special occasions.   Their menu has some flexible options which allow you to get on the items you want. Love it",

For less than $10 this is a good deal but I think compared to many other Japanese hibachi places like this, the food is a bit lackluster. The cook put just a tad of teriyaki sauce on the chicken and it was an up-charge of 95 cents. I mean, if you are going to charge me more, let's really make it teriyaki chicken. *face palm*   All in all, I may return if invited and other places in the area aren't open for lunch; but I would rather wait until dinner and go somewhere else.",

The man on the phone told me it will be ready in 10 minutes,  my lunch starts at 12 so perfect that gives them 10 mins to get it ready and 10 mins to make sure it's ready. (Normally it's always ready in 10mins)  I got there at 12:05 which means it had been 25 mins, 15 mins over the ready time.   I go in and the guy asked me how can I help you, I let him know I had a pick up order for myself (there were 2bags on the counter)  He says OK then he proceeds walk off to go and help 5 other people before even checking if my food was out/ ready or anything.   10mins pass by, And then after that he goes in the back & I see him packing up another bag, which ended up not being mine and he ask me if I ordered online or on phone, I said on phone, he said what did you have? I said express hibachi steak he with what?  I said do you not have my order in? He said no.  So now it has been 35-40 mins since I've placed my express lunch order and they haven't even started it!  Normally I wouldn't be upset BUT he would have known this had he checked on my food when he asked me how he could help me. As well as because now I have to go back to work hungry because I don't have time left in my break to wait or eat anything.",

    "text": "I came here with coworkers and friends a very long time ago for a girls night.  It was a pretty awesome time!  They were able to accommodate our very large party without any trouble.  We did not have to wait long to place our order or to eat.  I was happy by the swiftness of service.  The food is delicious.  I like that they serve rice AND noodles, not that I can eat it all....well maybe I can, don't judge!  They give SO MUCH food it's crazy.  It's always fun to do hibachi.  Everyone had a good time that night and left stuffed.  Plenty of food also for the next day, that's another plus!!",

She bit into it and started panicking because it was so spicy. I tried one and agreed it was far too spicy to be just a teriyaki wing. My wife was eating teriyaki sauce, so we were surprised when the waitress told us it was correct and teriyaki is always spicy.  The teriyaki they served was not what was on the wings. I would have given this four stars for the food, but the fact that the waitress just shrugged and walked off without even asking if there was some way to fix it was disappointing.",

The sushi was basically grocery store level maybe even worse and the teppanyaki was overly salty. The quality of all there food simply was not there. They did put on a decent show though and I would recommend it for families with kids or if you live near by and do not want to travel to the other better places. Other than that they have similar prices to other places so it is a waste of your money.",

The chef was somewhat entertaining, but not near us much as some other places that I have experienced.  We were there for Lunch and the prices were reasonable for the amount of food that we received.  However, I would have been disappointed to receive the same amount for the much higher dinner prices.",

Staff was very friendly (hostess, waitress and chef).   I found the food to be good but expensive for what you get.   Ice berg lettuce salad was very disappointing.    Most importantly, I was not comfortable with the cleanliness of the restaurant (under table, under and around stove they cook on).     I won't be back.   If they totally renovate I might give it one more try",

    "text": "Horrible food.  I hate to rag this place but...  The sushi is \"mall-quality.\"  It's not horrible, but it's just C-level fish.  The huge problem is the teppanyaki...just awful.  I ate there over the Christmas holidays.  I love this style of cooking and it's kinda hard to screw it up.  Here's how Kabuto managed:  -  The chicken was so salty it was inedible.  I ate 3 bites and had a headache for the rest of the evening (and I like a lot of salt and seasoning).  -  I also had a problem that neither the cook or the server questioned if there was a problem with the food since I hardly touched my chicken.  They probably didn't notice since...  -  The cook just GLOPS piles of noodles and rice on your plate (and on the table) like he was slopping hogs!  Only a 3 year old could be comfortable eating here.  Just crap.  -  I didn't say anything because my relatives have friends who work there.  If not for this, I'd have talked to the manager.  The food was awful and the presentation was worse.  -  Our cook even screwed up the \"onion volcano\"...first time I've ever seen this botched.  -  Kabutos wasn't always bad.  I used to eat there every few months back in the 90's (before I moved away).  It's really gone downhill.  They now serve mostly rice and (now) noodles, and only a few bites of vegetables...all of which are completely over-seasoned.  I honestly think the cook just doesn't know any better.",
