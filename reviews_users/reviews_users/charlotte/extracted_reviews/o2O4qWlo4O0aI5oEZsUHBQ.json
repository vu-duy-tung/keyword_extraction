    "text": "Bleh.  If this is the best sushi in Charlotte, my god. They only have uni on Friday and Saturday, a good sign that this is not a place that is serious about fish and doesn't draw in people serious about fish.  This is a breed of silly asian fusion for people who do not care about authenticity and doesn't realize the food could be so much better. Sure the food is served in a place that is overly dark and features neon and service was friendly enough, but geesh.  The table ordered a bit of this and that - the dim sum starter looked and tasted like it was from costco, the maki were buried in gooey sauces, etc.  The waiter referred to our sashimi as sushi, also not a good sign.",

I liked their fresh sushi and even some of the rolls, but after seeing them get an inspection score that was well below par, on 2 occasions, I stopped going. That, and I witnessed the bartender dealing drugs on numerous visits. The same family owns 18 in Blakeney and we prefer that over Jade, but ditto on the restrooms! Hoping better sushi and better service arrives in Ballantyne soon!",

    "text": "Tonight was my second time in the past month eating here. The first time was take out and we waited for nearly fifty minutes for our food. The gentleman at the door was upset for our very long wait and gave us a gift card for 20.00 to offset their mistake.  In honesty that would have normally stopped me from going back ever again but since I did not have to complain and the gentleman in charge took it upon himself I felt everyone deserves a second chance. Tonight we returned. My wife had , \"The Signature Sushi Roll' and found it to be delicious.  Her soup, \" Thai Tum Yum Soup was ehh they used half an onion in the soup instead of the promise of scallions. Completely changed the flavor. My daughter ordered the  Yellow-tail Fantasy Sushi and it was horrible. More of a nightmare than fantasy. The Yellow-tail was smelly and tangy to both of our tongues. It was bad. Her Avocado salad said it came with mixed greens, avocado , tomato and dressing. Well the greens they are talking about is iceberg lettuce with a sprig of some type of bitter green. It was terrible as well.  I ordered the Tempura Roll which is suppose to come with 6-8 pieces and I only was given four. It was also completely dried out. I also ordered Spicy Yellow-tail which was actually pretty good. Overall a failure in quality control and execution of the dishes. This is my last time going here and I would suggest that you skip it as well. IF you should choose to go I wish you the best of luck. Your going to need it.",

    "text": "Point blank...they have good sushi. The quality of the ingredients, the variety of rolls, and the quality of the rolls (i.e. how tightly rolled, etc.) is all good. Definitely better than some of the other sushi restaurants near the Ballantyne area. The ambience is decent as well. Not great, but definitely doesn't have a negative impact on my experience there. Occasionally the cluelessness of the hostesses can be a tad annoying, but I usually forget about that once I'm a few sips into a glass of wine (decent selection, including some of my favorites that I buy regularly). However, I find it very irksome in this day and age that they have decided having a website wasn't necessary. It used to exist I believe, but now it does not. And as someone who likes to read the whole menu, I like to be able to do that before I go somewhere so I'm not holding up my fellow diners when it comes time to order. Additionally, they seem to have some trouble getting courteous, hard-working individuals to answer the phone there. The last time I called for take-out, they didn't answer at first. After the second call, someone answered and immediately put us on hold and did not ever come back. We called back in case it was an accident, but unfortunately the girl that answered basically admitted to just not taking our call and was completely unapologetic. Needless to say, no sushi take-out that night. Overall, despite liking their food, I find myself crossing Jade off my list of possible dinner options on a regular basis.",

    "text": "I ate here last night and I was very disappointed.  The food was average, but the service left me thinking this restaurant was much worse than it most likely was.  When I first sat down, I was excited about the dinner.  The deck view was great, the hostess was friendly, and the waiter was at the table with water almost immediately, but things went downhill after that.  I ordered the calamari app and noticed immediately there was a pubic hair in the middle of the peppers.  After waiting for over 5 minutes for the waiter to come back, I asked another waiter to go and find him.  When he came back and I showed it to him, he pulled it out, inspected it, said \"hmm\" and walked off without an apology.  The sushi, which was ordered at the same time as the app, took over 30 minutes to get to the table and it was average.  When the check came, the waiter dropped it off, and once again never apologized about the pubic hair.  When he came to get my card, I jokingly asked him if there was not some sort of discount for having to deal with that and he looked at me very seriously and said \"yes, I took off the app\".  I was shocked and when he came back with the bill, he let me know that the manager gave me a 10% discount and took off the app.  At this point I was ready to leave, but I did point out that I didn't eat any of the app because it had a pubic hair, not a regular hair, in it so that was to be expected.  As I stated, the food was average, but the slow and service and lack of apology and concern made this much worse.",

    "text": "I'm having a hard time deciding between 3 and 4 stars. On one hand, my dining partner and I really enjoyed the four rolls we got, but on the other hand, we were hard pressed to find something that wasn't fried, covered in tempura flakes, or stuffed with tempura coated protein. We ordered the 4 seas naruto, the samurai, the super crunchy, and the cherry blossom. The thing I liked about Jade was that the chefs take a common concept but change maybe one or two things about the roll to make it just a tiny bit different.  I really appreciated the 4 seas naruto: it was four types of seafood wrapped in a thin layer of cucumber with no sticky rice. It was clean and refreshing. I think I probably could've eaten eleventy billion of those pups. The samurai was pretty commonplace but with the traditional tobiko replaced with black caviar. The super crunchy, well, we've had a million super crunchies by now, but I liked the fact that it was coated in crisp rice in place of panko or tempura flakes. The cherry blossom was recommended to us by our server, but we ultimately decided it didn't really feel like sushi. I liked that it was wrapped in soy bean, but other than that, it seemed way too safe.  I wouldn't necessarily say I'm a sushi purist, but I am growing a little concerned that sushi in the South is becoming synonymous with tempura and fried (but then again, doesn't the South pride itself on frying EVERYTHING?).  One thing I'd recommend trying here is the Fuji Moon. It's a Blue Moon with a splash of apple sake. Beer+sake usually means my college drinking buddies and I are up to no good, but this beverage was really comforting during our late night bite.  So, today Jade Asian, I'll give you 3 stars. I'd give you 4, but I'm pretty stingy.",

Oh my goodness it's just so delicious. Their kalbi is pretty good, could be charred a bit more. And their desserts are so delicious, they have this one amazing dessert called the Chocolate Trilogy. It's a mousse with the three different layers of chocolate mousse. And they have this amazing bartenders, that does the most creative shots. I can't wait to visit their sister restaurant 18",

I'm a Tuna lover so I looked for something that would satisfy my Tuna craving.  I settled on the Maguro Madness roll and then proceeded to ask for a couple hand rolls with just tuna and avocado (maybe some radish if they have it) The lady taking my order seemed a little confused at my request.  It sounded like she was searching for the right button to create my order and since there wasn't one she acted as if I was asking for something bizarre.  She indicated that they have a \"Spicy Tuna Hand Roll\" but my experience in the past has been that those usually have the tuna all chopped up and added with filler.  She couldn't seem to put the order in just for tuna and avocado on a hand roll.  So I decided to go with the Spicy Tuna Hand Rolls.  What a major disappointment.  Not only was the tuna chopped up to an unrecognizable consistency, they add in Rice Krispies as a filler.  Disgusting display of what could be the best hand roll on the planet.  I was really disappointed and the Maguro Madness roll did not ease the pain as it too had the Rice Krispies in it and it was covered with shredded fake crab meat.  Sorry Jade.  You guys are amateur at best.  Will return but probably only for Tempura.  I can't imagine you can mess that up.",

    "text": "Our night out at Jade with friends for a holiday dinner turned into onto one of the most embarrassing dining experiences we have had.  *One member of our party has severe allergies to gluten. She asked the server for gluten free soy sauce. Server returns with soy sauce, first ingredient:wheat. We give back the soy sauce and ask the waiter for gluten free soy. He goes back a second time, comes back, and says the shipment hadn't come in. The gentlemen with us hopped into their car about to run to Harris Teeter to grab some when server finds some in the back. *We placed an order to come on two plates for each couple. Our friends only have 4 of 6 items come out on their plate, as do we. We realize this as we start to eat and tell our server. He goes back to check what happened, and tells us the remainder of our food was mistakenly brought to another table and will be right out. Comes out about 20 minutes later. Sashimi was super small slices. *One roll that came out later is the spicy tuna roll that myself and other couple ordered. So, apparently their spicy tuna has crunchy in it=gluten. I tasted this just as my friend allergic to gluten was eating her second piece.  At this point we call the manager over who we find out is actually the owner. So John Chin walks over to our table, arms crossed, rude look on his face, and interrupts us as we are beginning to share our experience first about the gluten free soy sauce. He addresses us with his voice raised that he took the soy sauce was mistakenly from the gluten free bin, and then he ended up finding some. Fine.  Secondly, we share how we had to wait for half of our food for 20 minutes after it was served to another table. He then proceeds to argue with us that it wasn't True and all of our food was on one ticket. The server asks to talk to the owner away from our table (as this owner is beginning to cause a scene). The owner actually comes back to our table with a handful of tickets and starts going through the tickets AT OUR TABLE to find ours to 'as he states' prove he is not a liar. We are beginning to tell the owner this is so embarrassing to us, he needs to stop, and leave our table. The waiter then apologized profusely saying he ended up not ringing in the full order and that in all actuality he was trying to scramble to get us the rest of our order. He says he should have said something and took responsibility for the mix up.  As for the crunch in the spicy tuna roll, owner says it has always been made that way. However, for people who have allergies this is not stated ANYWHERE in the description. He repeats loudly that it was always made that way for years, that's it. Our friends who have been in the industry themselves cannot fathom how an owner/manager would come at this situation in pure defensive mode. No apology, no comps after bottles of wine and hundreds of dollars. Our waiter (whom I felt badly for at this point) offered to buy us dessert on his own dime, which we refused.   I have read reviews of Jade before mine that have all had negative interactions with this owner. We will be sharing this experience with friends, family and coworkers of large corporations that frequently dine in the Ballantyne area. I will no longer be supporting a restaurant or any of the chains where John Chin is the owner.",

Our waters were empty and ice melted, sons plate was clean and we were twiddling our thumbs when the busser realized we were finished and sent waiter over - no questions asked, dropped check and ran off again. Busser took credit card and gave to waiter and we never saw that guy again.... Weird. No thanks - I will stick with sushi 101, they're attentive and much cheaper. Not to mention, parking is no where near as difficult - hope Jade gets it together.",

The service is always quick and friendly at lunch and they know how to cater to people on a lunch break!

He brought out the wrong dish, never checked back, and kept forgetting things we asked for! What is more bothersome is that they weren't even busy! Only about 4 tables in the whole place. I had to get up to get water for our table. Twice! You can't serve spicy food and not refill drinks! Plus we told him we were in a rush and the meal still took about an hour and a half! Thanks for making me late for my meeting Jade.  I won't be back so no worries of that happening again. Good luck.",

I had no expectations going here and was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered: California Roll (my least favorite part of the meal) Roll (Spring Roll or Egg Roll - not sure, but it was good) Mango Tango (shrimp & chicken in a spicy mango sauce - it was delicious!) Mango Salmon (salmon was excellent, the mango flavor was a little lacking, but overall a good salmon dish).  The reason I'm really writing this review is because of the service. We had Sean - the GM - and he was PHENOMENAL!!! He was the best server we have had in the Charlotte area!!! We moved here almost 3 months ago and have been eating out every day because we have not gotten completely settled in our home yet. So we have had plenty of servers and not one had been in the same league as Sean! If everyone in the restaurant business could be trained by Sean and provide the customer service that he does - WOW - customers would never complain about the service they received!  And when Sean wasn't at our table, another male waiter was removing plates, getting refills for us, etc.! Like I said, overall PHENOMENAL customer service last night at Jade!!!",

We got there right when they opened at 11:30am and of course we were seated and served immediately. The service was attentive and pleasant. Everything on the menu looked and sounded amazing, but we opted for a couple of pieces of salmon & tuna, the dynamite roll (LOVED this!), and the Terryiaki scallops stir-fry. The salmon and tuna were tender and buttery, but the scallops, even though cooked in a brown rice stir-fry, could have been a tad bit more tender. I would return for the dynamite roll again, and try some other options on the menu. A bit on the pricey side ($45 for 2 with no drinks), but then again, I'm not the best sushi connoisseur, and could easy go to another good sushi restaurant and be just as happy.",

They would benefit greatly from keeping the owner away as he has zero customer service skills. I would have probably brought clients to this restaurant if the service wasn't so bad as I work for a large company down the street but would not come back even if there was a free meal involved. It's really too bad because I try hard to give people the benefit of the doubt. Oh well, looking for another sushi spot.  Took my group of 12 to another Ballantyne Restaurant last night 1/14",

I was wrong, this is a great place to take a bachelorette party to start off the night.  It was loud since the bar area was very close to the dining area, but we weren't there for a quiet dinner.  This is located in the Ballantyne shopping area where you can see a movie, multiple dining options, and park in the huge parking deck.  So not bad.  The sushi - the first thing I noticed were that MOST of the specialty rolls were filled with \"Spicy tuna/salmon/etc.\" where they mix the fish with hot sauce and mayo.  Not my style as I want the real deal.  Don't get me wrong, they had some rolls with the fish on top, but we had to try at least the regular tuna roll.  At least the day we went, the tuna felt too chewy, not melt in your mouth.  Maybe this was a sign of freshness, or lack thereof.  Overall, the rolls were tasty and ok-priced for the ambience.  I assume the Spicy-treated sushi makes up for the lower price.  I enjoyed it there, but I'm not loving all the selection.  I would bring a larger group of friends for a nicer dinner for casual sushi that won't break the bank.  Don't fret, 3-stars is still good!",

I have a very severe food allergy and because I was so distracted talking to my group I forgot to ask about dairy when one of the group members placed an order for the group. I didn't realize this until Alexa had dropped off our food and walked away.  Thankfully Patterson, another server, walked by and I asked him about the ingredients of the sauces on my food. He talked me through everything and the things he wasn't sure about he asked the chef. I was blown away that he would take that kind of time to personally find out for me when I wasn't even at one of his tables.  I will definitely be coming back to Jade and asking for Patterson! Such good service and good food!",

The Tum Yum soup was unremarkable-just take it off the menu.  I love super spicy things but this had something in it that was irritating and made me cough with every sip. Had the big tuna roll which was very small with paper thin slices of tuna and avocado.  Very tiny.  Service was so so at best.  When we arrived we were told they were out of hot sake (which was fine, we don't drink it,) but when I wanted hot tea after dinner they were out of that???  What the heck?  My thoughts all night.

But if you go here, you will be doing yourself  disservice if you miss the King Toro Roll. It is $15.95, and the price point made me pass it up a couple of times. Then I tried it. Amazing. If they raised the price to $30, I would still buy it.  The spot is perfect for lunch if you work in the Ballantyne area, and a great place to go on a date. The interior reminds me somewhat of a upscale restaurant in the 60's.  If there are non-sushi fans in your group, they offer a menu full of alternative foods with a little bit of everything you would expect from an Asian fusion type establishment  If you go and try it, just remember to thank me later!",

Hella hot is my favorite roll here, and it was squeezed so tightly that it came out looking deformed and toppled over and fell apart as soon as they set the plate down. Ordered a fusion roll because of the sweet potato tempura, and 4/8 pieces in the roll didn't even have any sweet potato in them, just cucumber and rice. The garlic sauce option with veggies and the mango tango were both disgustingly sweet. We asked our waiter and he gave us this intricate explanation of the sweet counteracting the spices, but it was all just sweet, nothing else. To top off the horrible meal, our waiter's trainee spilled soy sauce on the table when clearing our plates, and just muttered an apology and walked away, while two of us sat there with no napkins and soy on our clothes and arms. Given this place enough chances, even hosted a large private bday party here in the past. But now, Mediocre service and horrible food. See you never, Jade.",

If you go here, you have to order the cherry blossom roll, it is fantastic. It's nice here because if you are with some people who maybe aren't into sushi, they have a ton of other dishes to choose from since it's asian fusion style. I've been here twice so far and have sampled a decent amount of rolls and starters, and you really can't go wrong. For all you tofu fans, get the crispy tofu to start - very good.   The inside decor is really cool, and they have an outdoor seating area as well. If you dine outside you can hear the music from the village bistro downstairs, which is great if they have live music (they normally do.) Only one small glitch when we were there the last time: it was during the week, they had free tables but told us we still had to wait twenty minutes, because they didn't have enough servers. They didn't expect it to get as busy as it did, which actually isn't really a bad thing!   PS -- they have a private room for parties or meetings with a big flat screen mounted on the wall.",

    "text": "The Sushi Review  Jade Asian Fusion   Cool Spot - Good Sushi   Following in the urban trends of popular theme restaurants, this scenic Ballantyne hot-spot often doubles as a nightclub after hours. That was the circumstance by which I familiarized myself with the entire area. I attended a Russian party there that was topnotch. As per usual, I decided to go back to try the sushi with my divochka (baby-girl). I thought we were in a little trouble at first because of the slightly inadequate service and my mojito which contained so much mint it resembled a glass filled with sprite and collard greens.   But we quickly got past that when the sushi arrived because it was hitting and sticking on point like as if we had been wishing for collard greens and chicken outdoors at a barbecue. The \"soundboy\" roll (tempura philly) was adequate but the spicy yellow-tail was first rate. Sit outside if it is warm and order a California red, they have a pretty good selection. It's not cheap, but what is in that neighborhood. Overall I say check it out. And if they start moving the tables for a party - stay. You will thank me.",

Their sake menu is also fairly priced.  I also cannot stress how important this is, they offer real wasabi, not green dyed horseradish (the wasabi found at most cheap sushi places). Makes a huge difference.  My wife a vegetarian also loves this place, they have several Asian inspired noodle/rice dishes as well.",

    "text": "So Thursday, March 21st, we went there for Sushi since this is what my daughter wanted for her birthday dinner. We get there were a bit late at 6:15 for our reservation. The place was not that busy, but we were a party of four with a child and they wanted to put us in a booth with no highchair. Not that big of a deal but we saw several larger tables that they said were spoken for larger parties. We were there for over 2 hrs and no one ever sat at the larger tables. It wasn't that big of a deal but they said that they only had a couple of high chairs in the entire restaurant and that both were unaccounted for at the moment. We later found out that someone had taken one of the highchairs outside and it was on the balcony. Our waited Bryan, excellent!! He comes from a family of 6 mostly female so he knew when he saw my husband and myself and 2 girls exactly how to treat the girls. Great guy very personable. On to the food. We spent right at 170.00 on the three of us that were eating. The baby (3yrs. old didn't really eat much....rice) we ordered from the sushi menu and had 4 rolls, Cherry Blossom, Rock and Roll, Jewelry Box, (2) Dragon Egg, Ballantyne Roll, Lime Rickey Shrimp, Rice and Chicken Bowl, another coconut shrimp with a honey sauce ?? and another roll. The food tasted good, but the aftermath was horrible. We all got sick. Today, Saturday morning at 8:15 am I am still sick with a stomach ache and upset stomach from some type of food poisoning or bad sushi. My whole family with the exception of our small child got sick. I have not felt this bad after eating sushi ever. We LOVE sushi and eat it on a regular basis. We had not been to Jade lately, but she specifically asked for Jade for her birthday. NOW, here comes the BEST part!!! WE have NEVER EVER called and spoke with anyone about a negative experience we have encountered! My husband called and spoke Shaun (the Manager) and he said he would have to call back. He spoke with his chef and called back and said the only thing we could possibly have gotten sick from was the soft shell crab. NOW, IF YOU TELL ME THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT I GOT SICK  AT YOUR RESTAURANT and then you offer the price of that entree which was $12.95 and another $7.00 for good measure. ARE YOU INSANE!!!!!!! We spent $170.00. VERY BIG MISTAKE!!!       My father and grandparents had owned restaurants for 50 yrs. My sister and brother-in-law now have taken over one of the restaurants, my other brother owns another restaurant, I come from a family of restauranteurs. I know what good service is and I know how hard people in the restaurant industry work. I worked in the restaurant business in college and now my daughter works in the restaurant business for spending money through college. I come from this industry in my blood, I know how to treat people and how to make them happy and feel self worth. Did I also mention that almost all of the workers that started with my family continued to work there until retirement.  This alone speaks volumes about how you treat people!! ESPECIALLY OUR CUSTOMERS.   You treat them with kindness and respect, something Shaun does not know anything about in this day and age of trendy places with BAD FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! MY ADVICE STAY AWAY FROM JADE RESTAURANT!! I wish I would have come on here and read the reviews about the poor sanitation of the restaurant before we came here. However, I have never really read food blogs or critiques on restaurants. This was worthy though of my pen and ink!",

Our table for nine was ready when we arrived.  The service overall was good.  The prices were also very reasonable. The appetizers and main courses came out timely and the water glasses were re-filled when needed. I had the lo mien with chicken and it was quite good. I liked that it was piping hot. I also had a spring roll which was good and my wife liked her soup. She had the Pad Thai with chicken that was a nice meal too.  Although the food and service parts of the meal would normally cause me to return, the noise level was way beyond my limits.  It was difficult to hear the person directly across me and likewise I had to raise my voice in order to try to carry on a conversation.  Even with the uncomfortable sound level, I'll still give the place four stars because of the good food and service, but it is unlikely that I will go back on a busy weekend night.",

Jade is on the second floor, so if you go back in the parking deck and park on the second floor, you can just walk the bridge and go right to the entrance. If you park on the first floor or in the lot, you will need to go up the elevator or escalator.  During the summer they have a nice patio area. The bar is very small, one counter, and they have one party room that is rather small as well.  There are quite a few tables and booths, but over all a very small/cozy feel. There usually isn't much of a wait time anymore and service is very fast.  I like the Cherry Blossom roll the best.  It's also note worthy that they serve Conundrum, which is a great wine to have with sushi.",

Rather than appreciate his clients, he showed his lack of care while picking his nose,  YUCK,  imagine the kitchen!  Bad experience.    The owner came to our table and proceeded to tell us our food was not cold, that he plated it for us so he knew that it was hot.  We explained, or tried to, that it was cold to the touch.  Later his employee told us the heat lamps in the kitchen were broken for weeks, the waiter was apologetic for the owner and the issue.    The owner is a real weenie.  It appears that others (below) have experienced his bad attitude too.  Rather than being kind and apologetic he try's to prove he's right at the expense of his patrons.",

I have been going to Jade, eating in and getting carryout, for 10 years.  We come here so often the hostess know us by name.  I visited 10-18-17 and requested to sit outside, as it was a beautiful night.  It took about 15 minutes for the waiter to even acknowledge that we were waiting.  The waiter came over with 2 glasses of water and then proceeded to take our drink order.  We already know what we want so we did not hesitate to give him the drink order and food order.  He left as though he was going to grab our drink order.  About 5 minutes pass and another couple is seated outside next to us.  We are now sitting at the table without drinks for at least 20 minutes.  The waiter promptly greets them and commence to taking their drink order.  The waiter then comes back about 5 minutes later with wine and a soft drink for the table next to us.  We are thinking that our hot sake has to be on the way.  We are now sitting at the table without drinks for at least 25 minutes.  The waiter never looks our way and we never got our drink order.  I know he is aware we requested hot sake because we had a conversation about other sake they have, but we told him we wanted the hot sake.  In my mind, there should be no doubt that we ordered hot sake, but for some reason he did not feel the need to fulfill our order.    We were waiting at least 30 minutes and I was upset, so we decided to leave.  We walked past the waiter and he did not even acknowledge we were leaving.  My husband had to turn to tell him he's a horrible server.  I would like to go back to Jade, but I don't know how they could hire such a horrible waiter in such a decent restaurant.",

And the food certainly reflects the decor.  Overall, Jade is good, and I'd definitely recommend it for a more \"upscale\" sushi place. They have a good selection of sushi (some of it IS pretty unique, like the Dragon's Egg, which is a big rice ball with some sushi-like things in it), and the quality is pretty good as well. I've never had a problem with service either, but it's just missing that one special something to propel it to 5 stars.   I will say that the outside seating is nice, and the string lights that hang down from the patio are a wonderful touch. I'd tell you what I recommend from their menu, but I can't access their website for some reason? Maybe someone should get on that....",

So much grime that he wiped his finger across the inside of the cup and a very noticeable amount of black dirt was on his finger.

They looked like pieces of art!  If I liked sushi, I bet I'd be coming here often!    I opted for two appetizers: the small steamed dumplings filled with chicken and the tempura with vegetables.  They were great and hit the spot.  John and Sasi raved about their selections too.  The food gets a five star rating.  My only issue is that the noise level was such that it was hard to talk. We were at a small table for three, so we were not spread out far from one another. It was still hard to hear each other.   Other than that, the experience was good.   Our waiter was very efficient for the first two hours we were there, but lost a little interest in us in the third hour.  I don't blame him!   I could easily find another dish to try next time; there are a lot of great options on the menu.  I left feeling happy that we chose to go to Jade tonight.",

    "text": "Another #Yelps10FirstsCLT visit today. I went into Jade just before they closed for lunch at around 2pm. When I walked in it was practically empty. But there were a few people at the bar and the hostess came right over to assist me. She was friendly and gave me a menu as I ordered. I couldn't decide between the Sesame or Teriyaki stir fry dish so I asked her which was better to help me out. Her response... \"Well the Sesame is fried and Teriyaki is a sauce\"....... *blank stare*...... Really? smh I got the Teriyaki Beef since I also ordered the Fried Calamari. 15 minutes later my food was ready and I headed back to the office to eat.   I started with the Calamari. They looked so delicious and crispy the way I like it and Fried Calamari is my favorite starter at any restaurant. I dipped in the Sauce and took a bite.... all I could taste was chewy bread. Upon further inspection it was either horrible Calamari or it was overcooked because inside that thick crispy coating (Which was VERY good by the way), was a super thin string of super chewy Calamari. I couldn't believe it. I'd never seen Calamari look like this, the worst yet. So basically that was a COMPLETE waste of money. I'd definitely stay away from that.  On to my lunch entree, which after the Calamari I was very skeptical of, especially since they put my egg roll directly on top of my rice, resulting in a soggy egg roll. That was disappointing, but my Teriyaki Beef was the best i've had at a restaurant. Oh my goodness, they don't need to change that recipe EVER. Not often do you go somewhere and order the Teriyaki and they actually season the meat with something other than salt as well as adding some of the best Teriyaki sauce, but they did. I could eat it all day. I'm struggling with rating this place a 4 because I really feel like a 3. I'll come back and try the Sushi which will hopefully redeem them. Though i'll definitely be returning often for the Teriyaki for lunch.",

I asked waiter why it took this much time he said , they were making hot sauce in the kitchen.. I am amused.. anyways but it taste good. So no complaint about taste, it's just if I would have gotten the food in time, could have enjoyed more at right temperature.",

Our server was great - an efficient and kind young man who was very attentive. The house salad had a wonderful ginger dressing and the sampler was scrumptious; however when we received our sushi mains, they missed the bar.  We ordered a variety of rolls, including the Cherry Blossom, The Signature, something deep fried and some general shrimp and spicy tuna. Nothing really stood out and we did find the rolls occasionally dry. The texture of the rice seemed a bit off, not as 'sticky' if I had to define it.   I'm hesitant to revisit the restaurant again for Sushi - we didn't try the entrees-  but the location is excellent. The sushi hunt continues!",

They NEVER seated us I came to eat and dance and help a friend Celebrate her Birthday it was sad enough ppl had let her down but then not to seat us at all, nor offer a menu  was insulting.  I suggest you find a better promoter because the guy in the White hat has horrible hosting skills. Also does not know how to treat paying customers WORST SERVICE EVER!!!",

    "text": "I've got to be honest, this place has gone downhill.  It used to be our de facto sushi joint and we don't go very often but today we decided, since I had the day off, to have a lunchdate.  First think you see when you walk in, is the 90 health rating.  I used to be ecstatic with a 90 in school, but for a supposedly higher end sushi place in Ballantyne, not so much.  We were seating and the waiter after a few minutes comes to the table, writes his name on the paper on the table, takes drink orders and disappears.  It's a good thing he wrote his name, but would have been better showing some attention to the guests.  Needless to say the service today for lunch was HORRIBLE.  My drink went dry 3 times, when we finally got our food it had a saucer of sauce on the plate and he spilled it while carrying it so we had soggy sushi to eat.  Just a bad experience.  The food.  Not good.  The Cherry Blossom roll was the best sushi roll in Charlotte back in the day.  Now, it is a $10, flavorless roll with no soul.  I felt cheated.  We got one more roll which also was flavorless and so forgettable I can't remember the name.  We got an appetizer of shrimp and veggie tempura and again no flavor.  It's like they've given up.  Lastly, the cleanliness.  I mentioned the 90 health rating....we also got the low sodium soy sauce in a bottle that has to be a year old.  The top was caked with old soy sauce and the glass part was full of grease and just plain nasty.  Oh, and there was a hair stick to the bottom.  I would have told the server, but please refer to my second paragraph.  Jade, you're still in business because of your location.  That's it.  There is plenty of other sushi places around and that's where I'll go.",

To make a long story short food was good mostly sushi but some in our party had dishes, all of our orders were wrong, we we given dishes we didn't order, made to pay for food we didn't get, and everyone got their food at different times...the food was good enough for the 3 stars but for a Saturday night that sort of service is unacceptable.",

    "text": "What a fiasco! Now I understand why this place gets such mixed reviews... plain and simple, the management is horrible (possibly as bad as I've ever experienced anywhere.)  My wife and I visited the first time for dinner late Saturday evening. It was about a fourth full. We arrived at 7:30, ordered miso soup, the Cherry Blossom roll and The Village roll. The soup arrived quickly and was okay but nothing special. 40 minutes later our sushi arrived. It was nothing special in flavor or display.  The wait staff is very young and seem very inexperienced. After a half hour, we discovered that our order was mistakenly delivered to the wrong table however  our young server offered us chance to \"munch\" on the half they had not tried. \"Only one bite been taken out of it\" he said. My wife and I looked at each other incredulously, and politely declined asking for a freshly made order. Our server then returned ten minutes later with our order, apologized and asked if it was anything else he could get us. We thought that meant he was comping us for our convenience. Okay fair enough but... wait it gets better, I mean worse.   We hesitated and suggested the dumpling appetizer. Of course when our bill arrived, you guessed it, we were charged $6 for the appetizer. When we commented to the server and we thought it was complimentary, he said no, that he was sorry we were mistaken but then did agree to remove it from our bill.   Now let me emphasize though that we don't blame the server. He was a nice enough young man, just inexperienced. The manager however looked over at a several times during our entire stay knowing there were problems, but not once did he walk over to apologize. Our server did mention his manager was sorry about it. That just doesn't cut it however.  Of course it should be obvious that we eat out quite frequently in Charlotte, but rarely have I ever experienced such incompetence. No, I will never return and nor can I recommend this joint to anyone. There are just too many comparable restaurants in Charlotte that competent management and care about their customers. This is obviously not one of them.  Go at your own risk. There's a 50% chance it may be okay and a 50% it will be horrible.",

She's doing a \"keto\" diet and so this is precisely the sort of food that she needs to stay on program. The restaurant is definitely fancy and being upstairs can certainly make it perfect for a successful date night if that's what you are looking for.  Their sashimi platter is a nicely presented platter with a selection of the usual core fishes including salmon and tuna and squid. Big pieces, thick slices, I'm told they tasted very fresh.  I stuck with traditional maki rolls and they do a good job on presentation and assembly here. Tasty and good looking, it is the usual \"edible art\" that I have come to expect from better sushi restaurants.  Definitely worth it at Jade Asian Fusion!",

I ordered a glass of wine ( you think I would know better) but it had the distinct vinegar flavor when it starts to get old. The only thing nice about this place is that they sat you right away. That doesn't mean that the staff would wait on you right away. Set your money on fire instead of spending it on a meal here.  You will definitely be a lot more satisfied. I don't remember when I have had a meal this bad. I would give it a negative 10 but yelp doesn't offer that rating as of yet.",

We asked if we can make it a little Spicy and so from a scale of 1-5, we asked for a 3. That's not crazy right? WRONG!  I think someone might have literally gone to hell and come back with some kind of sauce and they put it all over the noodles. It didn't feel like it was a 3 spice level it was THIRTY times the spice level.   We did also order the Cherry Blossom sushi and it was good.   Overall, we might try it again but will not be asking for any heat added to it.",

I ordered my food and received it within 5-10 minutes at the most. I am giving four stars because I wasn't able to get a full dining experience because I did do take out but I would definitely love to come back during their evening hours and actually sit down to eat.

It was getting too late to go out to Lam's kitchen in Matthews after seeing a movie at theater upstairs so we decided to go to Jade. The restaurant was not very full, yet we were told the kitchen was backed up. The server came over several times to check on us asking if we wanted an appetizer or soup while we waited.  I didn't mind waiting a little longer, but when the food finally arrived and was cold. The teriyaki steak was not just cold, it also tasted like a frozen dinner and had the consistency of a thin piece of leather.  The garlic shrimp was cold. Think about bitting into a shrimp that you expect to be hot and find it to be cold.  Our server was a nice kid and did the best he could in the situation.  I'm sure he'll do a great job wherever he works.  We walked out.  I hear that the building is supposed to be replaced some time in the near future. Hopefully Jade will be replaced, too.",

One dog on top of the table a couple of times. This parties children were running round our table and all tables around. It was like a playground. Balls being thrown around our heads and table. Bouncing the ball of the window and brick.  Customers getting up and moving. Customers complaining and manager John would do nothing. Everyone miserable everyone around this one party. It was stressful and gross.  And ball being tossed around are ok according to the manager. One family left that was having a birthday. I have children and pets. As parent and a customer there is a time and place. Common sense that everyone around them was uncomfortable and not enjoying the dining experience. We packed up our food and left.  Management could care less that many tables were upset. So much for having a nice relaxing meal on the patio. I have been there for years and never experienced anything like this.  I left so bad for the wait staff as they had their hands tied with zero backup from the manager.",

Although I've always had sushi here in the past, I decided to try something different tonight...so I ordered Pad Thai.  Surprisingly, it was very good, especially considering this isn't a Thai restaurant...though fusion.  The service was good too...and super-quick, as I mentioned my need to get to the movies quickly as soon as I was seated.  Although I've always liked the eclectic menu here, I've never liked the ambience.  It's ideally located, with a great outside patio seating, but the inside decor is just not right.  It tends to be on the chic side, but not quite...and definitely not cozy...thanks to their overwhelming display of white paper tablecloths!  I get the white linen tablecloths for fancier restaurants, but I simply don't get the white paper thing.  Not to mention that paper tends to wrinkle easily, and is simply not aesthetically appealing.  It may be a personal thing, but nope, just don't dig paper lol.  Anyway, since it was a quick meal, I'll make this a fairly short review by summing it up this way...Overall, I like, but don't love it.",

    "text": "I've never written a bad review about a place ever but after leaving this restaurant I was so infuriated that I felt the need to share about how awful this place was. I would give this place 0 stars if that was even an option. It doesn't even deserve the one star that I was forced to give it!     First of all the entire wait staff is extremely creepy and we watched the waiters (who basically look like Chip N Dales) hit on several different groups of girls sitting at tables around us and our waiter was trying to flirt with my sister and I which both made us extremely uncomfortable.       We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was absolutely disgusting. The squid was rubbery and I could barely bite into it and the the outer breading tasted exactly like the breading on the crappy frozen fish sticks that your mom used to make you eat as a kid. After being extremely disappointed with the appetizer we ordered some sushi. I ordered the shrimp tempura roll and my sister ordered a spicy tuna roll. The sushi came out and had a really cool presentation, my shrimp roll looked like a dragon and my sisters sushi looked delicious. There was even 2 pieces of salmon nigiri on the plate that we did not order so we thought it was included or was a bad attempt of hitting on us by our waiter. My sister enjoyed her sushi and the nigiri but my roll tasted like it had been sitting out for quite awhile and had a really displeasing texture.      For our entrees my sister and I both ordered pad Thai with shrimp. The waiter brought it out and I kid you not it smelled exactly like vomit. I even made a comment to my sister that it smelled off and she even said it smelled like someone had thrown up on her plate. The dish was okay, I've had way better but it was lacking and it didn't even have peanuts. After we had asked another waiter to bring us boxes since our waiter was nowhere to be found, he finally reappeared again bringing us the peanuts that were supposed to be served with the pad Thai....after we were finished eating!!!!!       The reason why I'm writing this review is not for the crappy food but for our idiotic waiter who brought us the check almost 20 dollars over what we actually purchased. On the bill it said we had ordered a \"white dragon roll\" a \"sexy salmon roll\" and 2 pieces of salmon nigiri. We asked our waiter to fix the bill because we had not ordered any of those things and his response was \"oh I think I made a mistake and mixed your sushi order with another table's order\" we asked if he could fix the bill and he chuckled and said \"well you see the thing is..you guys ate it so..\" I was FURIOUS how would we have known that's not what we ordered if we had never been there before. I told him that I would not pay for his mistakes and he reluctantly said he would see what he could do about it. The restaurant was pretty empty so it's not like there even was a legitimate reason for his mistake. Several minutes later he returned and told us he removed the sexy salmon roll and the nigiri but left the white dragon roll. He was extremely rude, unapologetic and was clearly pissed that he had to even come back out to bring the check to us. The manager didn't even come out to apologize. If our waiter had simply said I'm so sorry this happened I'll fix it right away I wouldn't even bother with this review but he acted like it was our fault that we got the wrong sushi. I will never ever return to that god awful place for as long as I live even if someone was holding a gun to my head. Do not eat here!!!!!",

After getting somewhat settled, one of the waiters brought us glasses of water.  However, the water ended up falling all over the table and us.  Our laps were soaked.  The waiter apologized and changed our table, but that was the only gesture that was made to improve our experience (e.g., no manager was on site to speak with us, we were not offered any complimentary items, we were not compensated for any portion of our meal).  Service for the rest of the dinner was mediocre at best, and while we tried to wait to place our order and to request the check, we had to seek his attention multiple times.  Maybe this was off night but this makes no excuse to have such shoddy service and to not have a system in place to help make the consumer's experience more enjoyable.  As a side note, I thought the food was decent (3.5 stars), but I would never come back.",

We were just wearing (adult length) shorts and cute tops and sandals but apparently it's a little more dressy than that.  We didn't look like bums though!  Sigh.

I was served a cup of warm water and a tea bag. That should tell you all you need to know about this place.  And the waiters are really just a bunch of guys who wandered in off the street. Not professionals.  I won't be going back to Jade Asian Fusion for any more meals. However, I will be frequenting the cafe downstairs from Jade.

    "text": "First and foremost, this is an Asian fusion place, as its name suggests.  So you'll get cuisine that represents Japan, Vietnam, China, and other Asian countries.  So don't call this a sushi joint, or Japanese restaurant, or anything like that.  The two hostesses really need to learn how to greet customers, like projecting warmth and a welcoming spirit.  Don't act like you can't be bothered with, especially when there is barely anyone eating there on a early Sunday evening.  So, I was in the mood for some recreational sushi, because this is Charlotte, and you can't find real sushi here, given the clientele of this city.  Ordered yellowtail, and albacore nigiri.  Both were forgettable and nothing special.  The spicy scallop hand roll was also very forgettable.  Finally, had a Cherry Blossom roll, which was loaded with sauces and looked very colorful.  It was also cold and tasted plastic.  But, I was in the mood for what I call recreational sushi -- fun, fake sushi drowned in sauces that regular people love to eat.  Still hungry, I ordered the pork chop lemongrass entree, which is based on a Vietnamese dish.  The pork chop (cut into bite strips) could've used some more lemongrass, but I'm sure it was prepared this way for the kind of clientele that frequents this place.  However, the most amazing thing about this entree was THE RICE!  It was cooked perfectly, probably the best rice I've ever eaten.  Each rice grain did not stick to each other, it wasn't mushy, it was so amazing.  If you think this is a lame observation, then you're probably not Chinese, or any other Asian person.  The pomegranate martini tasted good, though alcohol was severely lacking.  The very young server was ok, though needed more experience.  I kinda wanted another drink when I was done with my first drink halfway through the meal, but the kid never asked if I wanted another one.  He just took away the martini glass.  Oh well.  Come here if you wanna have some fun, but save the serious dining for elsewhere.",

The salmon and tuna were tender and buttery, the scallops, could have been a bit more tender. I could sit in this sushi restaurant and just slowly eat nirgiri pieces all day long.

The only drawback is that they ONLY have male server.   Every time I have been here, we were seating right way or within couple of minutes which is great because when you are hungry, the last thing you want to do is be seated. So their host is a female who happens to be CUTE! but all their servers are male.. hmm I am thinking their owner must be female :D  Anyways, so we order our drinks where I ordered sweet tea and I have to say, I was not pleased with it  then we order our entree since we are here for lunch and we don't want to be here for two hours LOL our entree arrives shortly after and I have to say it was good. The third time I was here, me and my friends decided to make it spicy and I have to say it was SPICY.   When an Indian man says it was spicy, believe it.... IT WAS SPICY!   We love going to this place because their food is perfect for our taste. We still think it's kind of wired that they have all male waiters and not to mention their water boy is wired... REALLY! We learned to ignore it since their service is fast, respectful (other than that water boy) and the environment/decor is very pleasant.   Note: I have ONLY been here for lunch!",

    "text": "GOOD ROLLS, but not much else.  OK, Jade had 2 weaknesses right in its name: the word \"Asian\" and the word \"Fusion.\"  Basically, neither is a coherent description of any type of food.  A word to the wise: when you see either in the name of a restaurant, then They Have Won.  Next, the sushi.  I ordered a chef's sampler of nigiri.  You know, omakase (a word unknown to the wait staff), which is supposed to demonstrate your chef's agility and creativity.  I got only 8 nigiri in only 4 types.  The nigiri were meager, gracelessly cut, and tasted nearly all the same regardless of the fish.  I can remember that one was salmon (because of the orange color and a slight taste variation) and another was tuna (gassed-tomato red)  but that's all.  I was left with a kind of post-traumatic stress disorder afterward, convinced I had lost my tastebuds until I returned to the Bay Area.  I ordered unagi just after in order to make sure I wasn't losing my mind.  The meal was redeemed with some kind of spider roll-type maki made with a fried soft-shell crab.  They did this one well, maybe because of the fried element.  I guess at least I left full.",

We decided to try Jade because of the review we've read.  The service was good but there was only 3 other tables in use at the time. Location is great. I guess we should have suspected something when we heard beach music coming out the sound system.  The table started with Edamame. It was fine. My daughter said the Miso soup was OK (she has had better). The Rainbow Roll was good by my standards but the others said it was just OK. The rolls did not stay together like they should have. A sign that they did not know how to roll sushi or just didn't care. Either way that should tell the owners they should take a long hard look at their staff. The Jonah Roll, I believe it was, was very good. The Udon Noodle was terrible! It tasted like dirty dish water that  someone put a lot of fish sauce in to hide the fact it was dish water! The Pad Thai had no flavor at all!   I am usually not this harsh but on top of the food being less than mediocre, we were all sick the rest of the day! What a way to spend your Birthday! We will never go back there again!!",

After watching him following his waitstaff around taunting and yelling at them, he decided to change his policy of accepting the Ballantyne discount card.  The table next to us used their card and the owner got mad and said that the waitstaff have been allowing the card on weekends when that is not his policy.  When we tried to use our card he then said we were not allowed.  When we complained he walked away from us mid sentence .  It is no wonder that all of the regular waitstaff have quit.

    "text": "I came to Jade to meet a friend for dinner before we went to see a movie.  It was pretty dead even for a weekday evening, but the waiter we had was really nice. I ordered the gyoza and some sushi.  Based on that I'd given them a solid 3 stars. However the service, and the ambiance of the restaurant is really nice.    I'll be very interested in returning to try some of their non sushi dishes as I'm sure they are probably very good. It won't be a go to place for sushi but hopefully since I don't foresee myself leaving the area anytime soon the regular dishes are great because I know I'll be back to check it out!!",

    "text": "I'll give this place a solid 4 stars.  My friends and I just came from a spin class at the Y, so we were still in workout clothes and stuff, but were stopped in our tracks when we walked in and realized this place is actually a little fancy.  The hostess was really nice and we asked them to stick us in a corner but we got a regular table anyway.  I had the miso soup, house salad with ginger dressing, cherry blossom roll, and the super crunch roll.  A really great meal after spin class - I was so hungry.  Also had a glass of wine...  definitely left this place full and satisfied.  Their cherry blossom roll lived up to the hype:  shrimp tempura, salmon, avacado, wrapped in soy paper... oh so good.  Definitely want to come back soon - maybe not all sweaty from cycle class though....",

    "text": "I have eaten at Jade before and would rank it about a 2 or 2.5 overall. Food is fine but not great as is the service. Further, the bathrooms are are usually filthy.  However this evening I would give it zero stars because they refused to honor my Open Table reservation. I was with a party of 3. One person put there name on the list (with a 20-25 wait) but I noticed the Open Table sticker on the door. I went to the Open Table app on my phone and found a reservation 15 minutes later. I booked the reservation and let the hostess know. However she advised she had seen me with the other person, considered us both walk ins and would not honor the reservation. So we left and I will NEVER go back to Jade again. It's not with the hassle for okay food.",

    "text": "The general consensus of 3.5 stars is about right for Jade.  That's exactly what I'd rate them if it were an option, but a 3 is too low when you factor in their excellent service, great atmosphere (indoor and outdoor), and timeliness (esp during lunch when most of the customers have to get back to work).  Plus, there really aren't too many better sushi spots in town and Jade is probably the best in Ballantyne.  I've only eaten one non-sushi item and... well it sucked.  Even though the server told me it was a good choice.  But some of their sushi is pretty good.  My favorite is The Rescue roll - I can't remember what's on the inside (spicy tuna I think), but it has fresh White Tuna and avocado on top drizzled with some kind of spicy mayo.  It's the reason I keep going back (but if I didn't work in Ballantyne I honestly probably wouldn't).  When all is said and done - The Terrace Cafe is the best restaurant in The Ballantyne Village.",

    "text": "Food was decent, but quite possibly the worst service I've had in many many years. I typically tip 25 to 30%, sometimes higher if the service is great, but he was lucky to get 15%. Took forever to actually get the waiter to take our order, he never came back to check in us in the almost 25 minutes it took to get our food. He never checked on us after we got the food to see if it was ok. Never came by to refill drinks, wasn't pleasant at all, and I had to yell across the restaurant to him in order to get our check. It was good food, but not worth it dealing with such bad service. No manager that I could see either (at least not one who came by). Not even the hostess was pleasant. The only  person who was halfway decent was the busser. And it was a Sunday evening and the restaurant was almost empty. No reason for this!",
