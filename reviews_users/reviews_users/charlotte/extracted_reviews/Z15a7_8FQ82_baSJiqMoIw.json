    "text": "I attended Wild Wing Cafe on a thursday evening and did not have to wait for a table.   I was with two other people and we chose to eat in the non-smoking section.  Unfortunately, there really isn't a difference between the non and smoking areas because we were accosted with cigarette smoke throughout our meal.  If smoke REALLY offends you, I would recommend you ask the host/hostess to seat you in the far corner of the non-smoking section.  I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken was extremely HOT.  Now, I enjoy spicy buffalo wings but the chicken in the wrap caused me to choke a bit from the intense heat.  The fries were good and the prices are very reasonable.  I don't plan on going back because heavy cigarette smoke and game-watching are not my idea of good night out.",

People out here aren't looking for fine dining (and Lord knows, Wild Wing Cafe is not fine dining) but they are looking for something fast and convenient. Ostensibly, this is what WWC offers. On a slow Tuesday at 12:30 pm we were the only customers in the place. They must have shut off the ovens, because our simple orders took more than 30 minutes to arrive. That's not okay. I cannot devote an endless amount of time to this enterprise; my lunch hour is finite.  And the nachos weren't even that good.",

They do have karaoke on Wednesday and also have other events like live music, beer pong, poker and other miscellaneous events throughout the week.  The place could be amplified if they had better drink specials in my opinion, something the place lacks.  They have a pretty big patio too, so some outdoor events would be nice to make the place more lively at night.  Food is hit or miss in my experience.  Fried pickles were horrible, but the nachos and fried mushrooms were off the chain.  Good college hangout or a place for local apartment people.  Just an average joint in my opinion.  Too many of these chain places in Charlotte already...",

Upon arrival, there was only one server working during peak lunch hours on a Saturday. When my food finally did come, my wings were slimy and undercooked. I notified the assistant manager on duty, Jason S. Curnell, who responded that unfortunately he couldn't do anything about my taste buds. He was rude, nasty and unaccommodating. Completely unacceptable for an \"assistant manager\" in the restaurant industry where profit is driven by good food and great customer service. Neither of which was received. I work in the restaurant industry & to see such poor customer service from a manager is extremely disappointing.",

The house chips were COMPLETELY cooked and crisp (unlike the other two locations where they seem to be oily and soft).

I don't know about the wings but the rest of the food really wasn't good.

We were lucky enough to get two servers since one was under training. She was trying to figure out what to do, where to get stuff but she was sweet, fast enough to bring out what we needed which is perfect.   They have huge projector right in the middle and LCD TVs all around so you can't miss a game even if you try hard enough to avoid one unless you go there during off game time.   This place is getting only three star because of the fact that our food sucked big time on multiple orders. My friend ordered medium spice wings and they made it so spicy, they couldn't eat it more than four piece. I ordered veggie stuff which came out soggy and finally we ordered chocolate molten cake, which was cold and hard.   Chili's at university has the best chocolate molten cake in town.",

Also makes for a great casual date if you're dating the type of girl that's into wings and sports!  The wing selection can't be beat... they've got about 20-25 different sauces. I like BWW, but the selection here is much more complete. I'm one of those people who enjoys extremely hot food, so my choices in sauce may be different from yours; I typically go for Habanero Hots or Chernobyl, or at mildest the Hot. Anything else to me is boring, but everyone's different. If you want to try the Braveheart, I would request just one to start with. I could put down a few of them but definitely not a dozen of them. They are VERY hot.  I am somewhat of a wing purist but I have heard great things about the boneless wings. The few times I've had other things on the menu, they've always been good quality-- chili, burgers, etc.  Great beer specials too; this location has been doing $3 Sweetwater draughts for a while now (Sweetwater Blue and 420), which is usually what I go for.  Definitely stop in and give it a shot; one of the best wing places in Charlotte.",

FIRST THE SERVER DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. So I get to the buffet line 4 dried out wings and no soup. I stopped 2 employees and asked about the food they looked at me like I was from MARS...I and I guess 4 people waited for wings nothing came out. I LEFT 3 dollars on the table for the tea and was out of there. I CALLED THE PLACE a few moments later and spoke with a bartender who sounded like he was on crack that said he was 'in charge right now\"HE kept repeating over and over what I was saying so there must have been some sort of medication... issue so I hung up.            I called their Corp office and spoke with \"David\" who said he was a district manager he said the bartender should not have been in charge and laughed about it   ????After he tried to sweep it under the rug he invited me to another location and told me it would be better and after about 3 weeks sent me a letter with a gift card..           So after about a month I was stuck in traffic pulled off and decided to give then one more chance... NOT goin to go into the terrible service while there you can message me if anyone wants details.. Anyway got wings to go got home opened the bag and a ROACH CRAWLED OUT DAMM. !!!!!! I called the CORP GUY and he said there is no bugs in that store...I ASKED HIM THEN WHAT JUST CRAWLED OUT A CHICKEN WING?

I don't know if it is been because we have gone when the place was short-staffed or not, but it seems to be a continuing trend (has happened 3 times now).  The only really good thing is the lunch wing buffet and you can get your food right away.  Granted we only have 1hr for lunch, but when you spend the 40mins of the hour waiting on food, you end up shoving the food into you so you can't really enjoy it.  Poor server seemed to be cooking the food as well since she would disappear for long stents at a time.    You are still on my radar WWC, but you are on the short list to be ousted from our lunch options up here in the University area. :(",

The Bartender/Server, Brian, brought out our side salads. While eating my side salad, I pulled a hair out of the plate that almost a foot long! DISGUSTING!     Brian quickly apologized and took the salad to the back. Kiran, the manager, came to us apologized and offered me another side salad which I politely declined.   When Brian was printing our check I asked him if he was going to discount or comp my meal. He said he removed the $2.50 sweet tea from the bill. I told him that was unsatisfactory and asked what he could do better. He said his manager, Kiran, wouldn't allow it.   I asked to speak with Kiran, again.  When Kiran arrived, I explained to him that the hair in the food was disgusting and that it was an awful experience, and taking the sweet tea off of the bill simply wasn't adequate; The minimum I would expect would be 50% off.   Kiran replied that there was NO WAY he could do 50%. That the HAIR was ONLY in my side salad and not in my wings, and that the best he could do was remove the tea.  I calmly explained to Kiran that I strongly disagreed. The feeling of eating in a place that is unsanitary is a terrible one. I have been a frequent visitor of Wild Wing Cafe for over 2 years as my company is located just down the road. He would be losing a lot more revenue by losing me as a customer then the $6.00 I was requesting off of my meal. I told him again, I felt it was inadequate but if that was the best he could do, so be it. He simply replied, Sorry.  I am extremely disappointed in the customer service.",

I've been a server for 5 years, so I can be a little judgmental of the service/experience when we go out, but I've had nothing but good experiences when I come here. Marissa is a great server, in my (picky) opinion :) The food is consistent, and the wings are delicious. The boneless wings are so much more than chicken nuggets tossed in sauce, like many places serve. The sauces are flavorful and not too heavy.

I also had the potato skin with bacon and cheese and when I picked it up the oil literally came dripping out like an open faucet. This place does not really stand out in my opinion. It is unremarkable. No different from any other wing joint but the food is good.",

I ordered the onion rings as an appetizer only to get 6 huge rings with tons of batter and oil. The batter wasn't that great either as it was coated with some spices and a good amount of Monosodium Glutamate (MSG).  I then ordered the Philly Cheese Burger. It's sort of a mix between a Philly Cheese Steak and a Hamburger. The burger itself wasn't bad. The let down in the burger was it was pretty expensive for a burger (which wasn't even that big.) I think I should have just stuck with the wings, but that's it. I don't think I will come here to eat again, but to drink with friends I will be back (even though the prices are a little expensive for day to day hang out.)",

With much excitement, we go for a late night snack. After being seated we were greeted and asked for our drink order. We ordered 2 waters and let the waitress know we were ready to order. She told us to hold on because she had nothing to write on. She came back with our beverages, took our order and we never saw her again. After 20 minutes, the food came out. We had no silverware. I had ordered a salad so I waited until the waitress came to check on us and I would ask for a fork... Guess what, she never came. I got up and approached the servers at the server stand and come to find out they are braiding hair....BRAIDING HAIR IN THE RESTAURANT. I have never been so disgusted. I will never be back. Terrible service. Unsanitary wait staff. Poor management. Complete failure. Disappointed...",

I have never been SO sick and so dehydrated to that degree in my entire life! A grueling 24 hours later, it finally got better. HowEver, another 24 hours after that it struck again, but even worse this time landing me in the Emergency Room on Christmas Eve. I was horribly sick, sweating profusely, and in so much pain in my stomach that my family had to actually call an ambulance to get me there. I thought I was having a heart attack or dying as all my systems went into shock. Turns out after being tested in the ER the food poisoning was from contaminated fresh fruit (I had ordered extra orange slices from WWC to go with my blue moon beer and ate all of them. ) But it wasn't just food poisoning, that was just the initial onset .. I had actually contracted the NOROVIRUS from this contaminated food that was served to me, which is why it struck again 24 hours after I felt better, the ER doctor that treated me said that's exactly the tell tale sign of the Norovirus and then a test confirmed it. I should have paid more attention to this restaurants dirty floors and sticky tabletop realizing cleanliness was definitely not on the top of their list. I hope this restaurant makes CHANGES IMMEDIATELY to protect the health of their customers. I not only was sick as a dog, but it caused me to miss Christmas with my kids which was even worse. :(",

Since moving, though, I hardly get an opportunity to experience Wild Wing anymore.  There's this one in the University area now, though, and I've gone there only a couple of times on my lunch hour.  Why only a couple?  Mainly the wait time.  Both times (once probably 2 years ago and once just this week) I've gone there during lunch, the restaurant was practically empty, and we still had to wait 30-35 minutes for our meals after ordering.  Seriously?  Did the cook not show up?  Is he/she still hung over from the night before?  Everything on their menu can probably be cooked in 5-10 minutes.  Maybe it's time to hire some new cooks?  On the positive side, I was very impressed by their expanded menu.  I already thought they had an extensive menu before with lots of fantastic choices, but now Wild Wing has even more goodies to choose from.  I went with an old standby, though:  \"Chicken Feathers\" (grilled chicken fingers) with China Syndrome sauce (mmm...spicy!).  You can get either fries with your feathers, or celery and blue cheese.  But you *cannot* get fries AND the blue cheese (for the spicy chicken) without paying an additional 50 cents.  And don't even try to request another tiny cup of extra sauce.  That'll be another 50 cents, please!  Luckily, I've learned my lesson over the years, and Wild Wing does a pretty good job of coating their chicken with sauce anyway.    My partner ordered the Bleu Cheese Basil Burger.  He said it was one of the most amazing burgers he ever had, so I tried a bite of it.  He was right.  It was amazing and SO full of flavor.  Italian marinade, crumbled blue cheese, and basil mayo = freakin' fantastic.    I guess most people who go there at lunch go for the all-you-can-eat chicken wing bar.  Some dribbled in as we waited for our orders.  I overheard someone stop one of the servers to remind her that the bar needed restocking as well.  Seriously, what's up with the kitchen at this location?  Shouldn't management be all over this?  I'd love to frequent Wild Wing more often at lunchtime, but I'm pretty soured on having to take an hour and a half for my lunch break just because the cooks can't grill some chicken and fry some fries in less than 30 minutes?  I can understanding waiting if the restaurant is busy, but when there's only 2 or 3 tables filled in your huge restaurant, come on...

    "text": "I have been to this location before and had great service--on their super busy trivia night no less. Sadly this experience fell very short. I was on a business lunch with 4 other people. Thankfully, I hadn't recommended this place. I'm a former server. I understand people have off days,especially when things are busy, but I could only count 2 other tables in the whole restaurant--including the patio table.  Salads (for the wing lunch special) were served, and we had to ask for silverware. Not a big deal.  I ordered a turkey burger. It took about average time for our food to come out so no complaints there. When my turkey burger came back a regular burger, I had to wait 10 minutes before I could even ask her it was a turkey burger vs a regular burger (they look and taste different)--and one is temped to preference, the other is not. I ended up taking my burger to go. One person's side came out incorrectly. We practically had to tell our server everything we wanted (beers, etc including extra orders of wings for the people that had ordered the all you can you eat wing lunch special.) in the 10 seconds when she visited our table before she darted away from the table like we had the plague. When we asked for the check, we had to ask another server there if she could run the card for us because we were just sitting around trying to get back to the office. If I was paying, I would have asked to speak to the manager, but I think this review is sufficient. I'm not sure what her priority was, but it didn't seem like she even tried to pretend that it was us.   If something is off--understaffed, etc, please let your table know. I would have been more understanding.",

No silverware or plates and when a waitress finally walked by (wasn't even ours) she said they ran out so we got 3 sets of plasticware... Even though there was 4 of us sitting there. My friend ordered a margarita and it never came. Then after flagging our waitress down I had to ask her if I could order food. All I got was 6 wings and one was just a small piece of fried bone... So really, just 5 wings. Waitress never came back and the girl that was training her brought our checks over. They should hire people who are actually nice and care about the customers who are coming in.",

The fingers plate was fine (besides the random onion piece in the bottom of the honey mustard), but the sandwich came out as a salad. Smh. He pointed out which one he wanted originally, and even wanted to show her on the menu when it went back to the kitchen. ... The sandwich that came out wasn't what was ordered (it was also missing the tomato from the sandwich it was suppose to be).  To be the only people in the place ordering food (others were at the bar and playing the golf game), the fingers and COLD sweet potato fries took 20 minutes and the (now to-go) sandwich took an additional 25 minutes. We were seriously the only people in there eating and our meal took an hour... When the place was dead!!!!  We also felt like our server was not thorough and did not pay attention. ... We even had to track someone down because we couldn't find any staff around. Sad first visit considering we live right across the road.  Really disappointed. (Music was cool though. I.e. slipknot, godsmack, etc.)",

We walk out sit down and we see two tables with groups of people smoking ALL THE THINGS. Hookahs. Now normally this isn't a problem. BUT! There's some sort of affiliation with these people and the waiters/waitresses. Friends/co workers off the job?. Whatever. They obviously know each other. Well. So well that the waitresses stop and associates every time they pass by! And they aren't the only things that are being passed around. No sir. Other things are being passed around. Drugs. Yes you read right. Drugs. I saw on not one occasion but TWO! That's right two occasions where there was transference of money and drugs by the waitress and someone sitting at the table. He first thing me was cigarettes. The second time, white substance in tiny clear baggie all hush hush. Not only are drugs being passed around but they are cursing like sailors! So loud. This is NOT good for business people. Not only that happened but our waitress gave us cold wings and charged us for something we ordered but never even got!!! I'm so very disappointed in this establishment.",

There were six people in my group, we all showed up within 30 minutes of each other and half of them had to wait about 15 minutes just to get a drink. Our server, who's name we didn't know, was pretty slow. She brought all our food out separately, and didn't even bring out one of our group members side item at all. When it was about time to go, I asked for the checks and she only gave me my check, so I got my card out and was just going to clarify that everybody wanted their checks, not just me. I sat with my card and check in my hand for at least 15 minutes. I made eye contact with my server twice while I was waiting for her to come back, she didn't come back either time or even give acknowledge me. She eventually gave the rest of my group their checks and took our payments. Third, overall the cleanliness of the restaurant was okay. The floors were dirty, but it was a Saturday night in a sports bar during football season. I wasn't bothered by the little dirt that was on the floor. I was bothered by the ceiling, the ceiling looked like it hadn't been dusted since the building was opened. I couldn't get a clear picture of the dust, because it blended in with the ceiling. It was absolutely disgusting though. If I would have noticed that before I have started eating, I honestly would have left. I don't even have words to explain how gross the amount of dust accumulated on the ceiling was. Overall, I will probably not be returning to this location. Bad service, gross building, and okay food.",

    "text": "Second night living in Charlotte, and I was craving wings. I was excited to see a Wild Wing Cafe close to where we were because I was craving the Colorado Copper sauce (my fav) and the house made chips. The moment I walked in my eyes were drawn to the filthy floor. I let it slide because I was ready for some wings! My husband and I went to the bar to sit, and we both noticed that the bar top wasn't very clean either. I needed to use the restroom, and the restrooms weren't clean either. The stall had toilet paper hanging from the coat hook on the back of the door, another roll on top of the dispenser, but none in the actual dispenser. I sat back down with my husband before we decided to order, and pulled up yelp. I saw similar reviews to the one that I am writing. After my husband used the bathroom as well he came back and said, \"okay, not sure if we should eat here.\" I agreed with him, and we left. This is so disappointing because I was excited to have a Wild Wings Cafe close by. In our old city we were there many Saturdays for lunch. I hate to say that we probably won't be back unless there is a change. Giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because the bartender seemed to be nice.  Ashley C - thank you for commenting on my post. However, for some reason yelp is not allowing me to message the restaurant or you. Could You please send me a message (if you see this) so that I can send you my info? Thanks!",

Over 20 flavors of wings(my go to meal). And daily food & drink specials. My wife actually just hosted my surprise bday there last night. She knows me too well. Food, sports, and booze under 1 roof?? What more do you want??",

    "text": "This is probably my worst experience ever at any Wild Wing Cafe is Charlotte. Granted we arrived 30 minutes before the kitchen close. We order 12 wings two flavors, dessert and spinach dip with sweet tea and water. We were unable to receive refills on sweet tea because the waitress stated that since it was close to closing time it wasn't anymore. Our appetizer was prompt and hot however the dessert was not right requested to correct it and never received. When we asked the waitress about it she said she didnt think we wanted it. After about 30 more mintues of waiting for our wings we noticing that the waitress ran out the door after another employee we asked for the manger. He was no where to be fpund. The waitress and stated that the employee who was the cook  had just quit and our wings was still coming. The manger shows up with no explanation or emphathy about the situation. When we finally get our wings that they brought in a to go box that we didnt request , the waitress states that the next time we need to come earlier and get better service. We all look at each like what the world.. Got the managers attention told him what happen. And this man going to say he sorry she said that and he will talk her about. Said he hope we come again and walked off. Geesh REALLY !  They bring the bill and we was tired ready to go . we paid with no problems when we could have just walked out on our bill because no one was around .. . They did not charge us for the dessert. But it didnt make sense because we never got it in the first place. We was very diappointed in the service and felt very negelected and rushed.",

Our service was awful, the drinks were unusually bad. I don't have high standards for alcohol, and my rum and coke was undrinkable, the soda was beyond flat.  We had to wait about 10 minutes for plates and silverware while our appetizer got cold and then after having to ask a second waitress, we got 3 plastic forks (there were 4 of us)   Drinks took forever to arrive and my husbands margarita was completely forgotten about and never delivered after we ordered it.   He went to the bar to just order a beer and the bartender didn't even acknowledge him so after about 5 minutes he just gave up. Not to mention the tables are SO sticky.   Idk if it's cause it's a football preseason night or what, but this is the last time we will be coming here. Terrible",

The waitress came over with a couple minutes to get our drink order first and she was very friendly. The food was served in good portions, although the were pieces of the chicken that were dry. Every thing else, food wise, was great.  The table, floor, menu and high-chair our daughter used was sticky, but we do not know why. We just went on and got over it.  The waitress brought our daughters a couple of stuffed animals from the vending machine up front, which was quite nice, so the customer service was great. I give a solid 4-star because of the sticky ness and the dry spots in our chicken. Overall happy with the visit.",

I walked in the door and I knew I needed to go to the host station, but before the door shut behind me an employee snapped at me and told me to go to the front for service.  I was sat at a table and it was sticky so I requested it to be wiped down.  Still sticky.  It was gross.  The atmosphere wasn't great.  The music from the jukebox was way too loud and I couldn't hold a conversation.  The live music was okay though.  I got the chargrilled chicken salad and requested the chicken to be not teriyaki, as described in the menu.  I was told no problem.  The chicken came out tasting like teriyaki regardless.  The salad was huge and I needed additional dressing.  I was told I'd be charged for it.  I said forget it and wasted half my salad because paying for extra dressing is nonsense but I'm not sure what I was trying to prove.  I won't be back to this location because I left feeling dirty and saddened by the customer service.",

Wings usually come out cold to lukewarm, ok cook on them and decent sauce, but not great. Not cooked like it is something they are named after.  This puts them at 3rd tier or worse for wing places, given even Shane's Rib Shack, fast casual, is better.  Just disgraceful.",

Our server Alyssa was nice and really in point with taking drink and food orders as everyone was coming in joining us. She also was very prompt giving the checks as we went to leaving and returning right away. The restaurant itself was very mediocre and the food wasn't good, partly because all of mine came out lukewarm or cold. I sent back the grand Queso I ordered because it had a runny consistency and it was cold. I ate half of my wrap since it was half off so only ended up being $4.50 and I was starving but that was lukewarm so it wasn't that good. Pro tip stick with the wings.",

After gawking at the array of snack wagons step inside and find a table, booth, or seat at the bar and enjoy a meal while watching some TVs or what's happening on screen or the stage.

Tony and Kasey are always sweet and welcoming and greet me by name.
