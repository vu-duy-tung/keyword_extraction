I kinda wish I'd tried it before going vegan...so now as a vegetarian (long story) I couldn't taste any of the Pho the other Yelpers were raving about. Nonetheless, no animals were harmed in the making of my meal so we're all good. For starters we had custom spring rolls with tofu and the wonderful delicious peanut sauce. Mmmn mnnnn, I could drink a whole dayum bottle of that! Speaking of bottles, hubs wanted a beer so he ordered the Saigon Export (which they didn't have), then he ordered the Tiger beer, which they also didn't have so he ended up with Lucky Buddah. He enjoyed the beer but they definitely need to update the beer menu. For my meal, I had the Tofu Vermicelli and it was very tasty.  It was alot of food so I ended up bringing some home to pack for lunch tomorrow. Bonus!! Hubs had the Tofu and Vegetables and judging by the dishwasher clean plate he left on the table, I would say that he thoroughly enjoyed it! I wanted to try one of the bubble teas but didn't have room for it so I'll definitely try it next time. My waiter was cool, (I think he was new), but he answered our questions well and took care of us. I'll definitely be back especially when I have more experience in the Vietnamese cuisine.",

    "text": "This little Vietnamese place by the Boardwalk at University seems like it still has some work to do and areas to improve on, but it wasn't a bad place. I didn't expect much walking in but was surprised.  I only tried the pho (pho dac biet) so I can't speak to any of the other dishes, but the pho was surprisingly good. The broth is rich without being too fatty, noodles were not over or undercooked. The amount of meat was proportional to the amount of noodles. The \"regular\" sized bowl is plenty of food and already a large portion. The \"large\" is huge! Only get that if you've got a large appetite.   The tables don't come with extra napkins, chopsticks, or spoons like typical pho joints and the plates of herbs are scant on the basil. If catering to a more Americanized crowd, this is fine, though I typically enjoy large amounts of greens and toppings for my pho. But they were fresh and the limes were juicy, so that's a pro.  My cousin tried the bun bo hue and asked it to be extra spicy, and though I didn't try it myself she did not enjoy her dish and thought it lacking in spicy-ness, even after she added in the sate (chili sauce)  The service was quick but very average. Waiters/foodrunners are young HS aged and lacking confidence/experience, but I wouldn't expect any more than this. I don't need exceptional service in a place like this anyway.   I wouldn't mind going back for pho if in the area!",

We also had the Com dac biet where the meat was too sweet and pho. The pho broth wasn't bad but they served us dac biet style with all the gross tripe and tendon when we asked for just rare meat and meatballs. Also, what kind of place doesn't serve veggie accompaniments to the pho??? Lime, bean sprouts, jalapenos: all necessities to complete the pho experience!",

The menu wasn't super familiar, so I asked the waitress for her recommendation. Item B1 on the menu. Waitress was knowledgeable, appreciated her opinion on what to get.  It was a bowl with thin rice noodles, some kind of seared steak, fried pork, shrimp, & veggies. There was a lightly sweet, hot, savory sauce that you poured over it. $12 for a generous portion & 3 proteins!  The meal was complex and delicious, looks like they have some more plain teriyaki style dishes for the picky. Paired with a laughing Buddha beer (Buddha shaped bottle!) and you've got a solid dinner for less than 20 bucks.  Seriously considering going back for dinner tomorrow (business travel).

    "text": "After one pho lunch I wasn't sure if I was ready to give Saigon Bay five stars - that's a big deal people!  My \"regular\" portion of pho was plenty and plenty delicious. I opted for P2- filet and the meat was sliced thin and came raw in my to-go package as to not over cook in the hot broth.  The to-go order was ready quickly and packaged well for transport. Saigon Bay is in front of Sushi 101 - in case you were turned around like I got.  A bowl of love that will satisfy any pho craving- can't wait to try them again and truly rave.",

When dish came to the table there was an ingredient included that i am unable to eat. So i mentioned that to the waitress and unfortunately made the assumption that a new dish would be served. No such thing.....the 15 minutes it took her to check on us she returned with no food. O waited for an additional 15 minutes and nothing. I cancelled the order. There was no apology, the waitress actually chuckled when i cancelled the order. Our family loves to try new and support our local businesses however this restaurant we will not be returning to. The lack of concern for their patrons doesnt deserve our money.",

The decor is very warm and welcoming. We didn't try anything else here, but the food that other customers ordered looked good and they seemed to enjoy it. They also have boba tea that they serve in sealed cups. Yay for this place, I'm glad to have found a great hot pot place finally.",

I quickly ordered my P1 pho and my rolls. Nothing special or out of the ordinary, but the quality of the standard dishes is what makes a good pho place better than others.   This place was average at best on all fronts, the sauce was good, the roll was a bit bland and dry. The soup base tasted really good for the pho, but I knew was high on MSG since I was consistently thirsty afterwards. The amount of ingredients are plentiful which is a plus. The quality was a bit below average, but it is hard to beat Toronto viet pho places. All and all, if you need a pho fix and decent pricing, come here!!",

Probably the one of the best bun I had, the sauce that came with the noodles was perfection. Tofu was crispy & marinated and I liked how my noodles weren't completely like smothered in the sauce. My mom ordered the hu tieu tofu stir fry, I tried some of it, and it was good. I didn't like how her noodles were completely drenched in the sauce though, it made it a little too salty. Whenever I'm in the mood for some bommmb bun, I'll be sure to come back!! The service was also very nice too!! (:",

No need to mention about how good of the broth and the meat were (they were exceptional), they even had the fresh small red chilis which is perfect for vietnamese dishes(though you have to ask for them). I would give this restaurant 4.5 stars, but since there's no such option this place deserves 5. Anything not good about this place is just minor ( they dont have some special vietnamese herbs and veggies) I would recommend people to try the deep fried quail as the apertizer. It was so amazing. You need to mix the pepper salt with lime juice and the fresh hot red chili ( if you can't handle the spiciness from the fresh chili, can use the siracha sauce too). The quail was marinated perfectly and they were all so crispy.  For the drink I had the bubble tea with avocado. Its so fresh and tasty. It's not too sweet like other drinks I have had in the usa. I loved this place and definitely would like to come back to try their hotpot",

First I asked the waitress what veggies were in the tofu veggie dish.  She list 5 different veggies.  The dish came with just big slices of white onions, spring onions and big (as in needing to cut with a knife to get in my mouth) chunks of red bell pepper.  All vegetables were way undercooked.  The onions were like biting into a raw onion.  The dark sauce on the veggies and tofu tasted incredibly old.  Lots of old garlic flavor.  yuuuck.  and the rice on the plate had clearly been sitting in a pot or on the plate for hours.  No way it was recently cooked.  Summer rolls were also ordered.  There were some shrimp in them.....  four strands of noodles and the rest was all white lettuce.  There was no flavor, no spices like cilantro or mint, etc.  Bland.  I won't ever be back.    I'm glad others are enjoying the place.  I must have just ordered the wrong dish.  My friend said her pho was good but nothing spectacular.",

I'm very skeptical about Vietnamese restaurants in general just because I grew up in California where there are tons of Vietnamese restaurants. First impression, nice location but what's up with the limited choices on the menu?  I ordered the combination bird nest (mi xao don thap cam) which was described to have chicken, beef, and seafood and a mixed of vegetables. The noodle was good, crunchy and light like how its supposed to be but then again, it's not hard to fry premade noodles and throw them on a plate. My protein consists 90% of chicken, 8% beef and 2% seafood and by \"seafood\", I mean 3 shrimps. Really? This was NOT the first time I've eaten the combination bird nest so I know for a fact there should be a lot more \"seafood\" than 3 lousy frozen shrimps.   So maybe its just my food that was bad? Of course not... My friend ordered the bun thit nuong cha gio, which to me is probably one if the easiest dish to make, and that was a fail. She got ONE salty egg roll, decent meat, non-pickled \"pickled\" daikon and carrot, and hot vermicelli? Pretty sure traditional vermicelli supposed to be cooled off before served and the only thing that should be hot on that dish is the egg roll and the meat, but ok, maybe its an Asian \"fusion\" thing?   The best thing there was probably the durian shake that my friend ordered and the super nice waitress. for a restaurant with limited choices, you would think they would perfect what little they're offerring. I would post a picture of what I ordered but after eating it, it was definitely not Instagram worthy so I deleted the picture. Sadly to say, I'm probably not going to spend anymore money here. Sorry Saigon Bay.",

Then brought me the right order except everything that come with the dish lettuce peanuts cucumber etc was not on my dish.  After all that he gave me a $.90 cent discount.",

Chicken wings were undercooked. Not just slightly, I mean there was a chunk of meat next to the bone that was still raw. Service was pretty bad. Server was either inexperienced or indifferent. Maybe both. But just not friendly at all. Visited on a Tuesday, between lunch and dinner. So there was nobody else there. However, it still took well over 15 minutes just to get appetizers, that were not fully cooked. And an additional 20 minutes for the pho and bbh. An average visit to a restaurant like this usually takes around 45 mins. We were here at 2:40, when we sat down in the car, it was 4:05.   So bad service, long wait, good food.",

    "text": "This place is LEGIT! A lot of Vietnamese places in my area really only just do the pho (and maybe vermicelli) well, but this place also does some other, less popular Vietnamese dishes.  + The large pho is MASSIVE. It could maybe feed 3-4 people (and I might suggest eating it this way and going family style on a few other dishes so your dinner isn't just one note consisting of a giant pot of pho) + Generous portions of greens, with culantro? which isn't always offered at some pho places + The salted limeade drink was an adventure! Definitely a more traditional Vietnamese drink that is an acquired taste. It might be more refreshing to drink on a hot day, I think. ~ Baby clams with sesame cracker. YES! Fun to eat and delectable--my family really descended on this plate. Really popular with us. However, I think it could have used more of an acidic element. ~ Knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful service (our waitress was nice enough to give us another cracker on the house), but could use a little more confidence. - The spring and summer rolls were a little pricey to me, but maybe it's because I usually buy them cheaply at fast food Viet places... Pho was just over $8, rolls were closer to $3-4 for small portions and vermicelli and other dishes over $10.  In summary, this place is worth a visit. Oh, and the bathrooms are super nice. ALWAYS a big +plus there. The atmosphere overall is relaxed, well-lit, spacious, with some pretty details. Keep it up Saigon Bay!",

So my first impression walking in was it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be. But that doesn't really matter cause we're all just here for the food. Anyways, we got sat at a half booth table and let me tell you, that booth seat was so uncomfortable but I didn't want to go through the hassle of having our waitress move us to a different table so I just put my big girl panties on and sucked it up. Lol.   So like I said before, I ended up ordering the pho and when I received the pho it looked delicious. The waitress was very accommodating and brought us the extra limes we asked for and chili oil. She was also on point at refilling our drinks making sure we wasn't slurping the bottom of our cups.   I tried plenty of pho places in Charlotte and even though none of these pho compares to the pho place back in Hickory, I honestly think Saigon Bay has the best pho that I've tasted in Charlotte.   By the way, it's right on the Boardwalk so that's always a plus. What better than to take a stroll around the boardwalk after all that food. This will be my go to pho place whenever I'm in Charlotte.",

First off, this place SMELLS amazing. You don't have to even walk in the door to start feeling excited for an awesome meal.   Our summer rolls were giant, soft, delicious... like a bun burrito. Highly recommend.   The hot pot was MASSIVE. I have to be honest and say that this was my first time with a vietnamese hot pot, and I... well.. I was a bit intimidated. It was different than a japanese shabu shabu where you kind of throw everything in and go for it.   There were new devices... wire baskets... I dunno. I just never felt like I was doing the right thing. Our server was very pleasant, and whenever I asked for clarification, or guidance, she told us that we can do it however we feel like we should.. which is lovely, and open ended. I feel like I needed a real hot pot veteran to hold my hand.   It was a TON of food, and for a very fair price. I'm thrilled that we chose Saigon Bay.",

We didn't start to get our orders after waiting about 20 mins. That's when we started to get impatient because I started to see other people get their food and they came into the restaurant AFTER us. Well, they started bringing our food one by one....literally. 3 people got their food, then they brought out one more order but then we had to wait another 5-7mins for the rest of group to get their pho. So nobody in my group really got to eat together. The first 3 people finished their food first and then we had to wait for the rest of the party to eat. Now for the food. I had a noodle dish that came with pork, shrimp and an egg roll. I enjoyed my dish, or maybe I was just so hungry from waiting. As for the pho dishes, they didn't enjoy it too much. The broth was so bland, where we had to keep adding hoisin sauce and fish sauce just to make it a little tasty. My overall experience was okay, but I won't be back.",

There were a lot of ethnic patrons (which I find important in ethnic restaurants). The Vietnamese iced coffee (espresso over condensed milk) was a perfect pick me up before a night enjoying the sights. Me and my sister both ate for less than $30. Will definitely add to me \"Go To\" list for the Queen City.",

The place was busy buy not jammed packed. After being seated, our menus came a few minutes later, the he left. He came back about 10 minutes later and we placed our orders (all pho dac biet-P1), along with 7 waters, tea and 1 iced-coffee.  The water/tea came out about 10 minutes later. While waiting, the waiter never came back to bring us utensils, plate of veggies or the condiment rack. We waited about 30 minutes before the pho's came out (way too long! and we had asked twice on the status) and he left again.. all the while, no utensils, veggies or condiments.  I had to go up and ask for these items. A couple minutes later the waiter brought the items.. then I notice 5 of the 7 bowls of pho did NOT have meatballs. 1 had 2 slices and another had 1 slice. (SLICES!!!) We also requested jalapenos, which did not come out until 15 minutes when we were almost done. My friend got his ice-coffee 2 minutes after the jalapenos came out.   I find it RIDICULOUS we had to ask for everything! On top of that when I got the bill the pen given to me did not work..so I had to wait for a waiter to come by and ask for another one. All around it was such a bad experience for me and my friends from out of town.. and we love pho that' why we took them there!  They were busy but not slammed jammed packed busy! No excuses for the delay and us having to ask for items that should have been brought to the table on time!  JUST POOR SERVICE THE ENTIRE TIME.. AND THE WAITER NEVER EXPLAINED (OR APOLOGIZE) WHAT THE ISSUE WAS! He kept doing his thing...   It takes a lot, and a really bad experience for me to write this review. But I'm hoping the owner/management sees this and makes changes!",

My Pho was served in a literal mixing bowl...huge!  I got the large because I planned to take leftovers home, which I had plenty to do so.  It was served with a size of Thai basil, cilantro, lime and jalapeno.  Not sure what another poster was saying that theirs didn't, maybe the server forgot?  My soup had a ton of veggies, I was really impressed!  My husband also really liked his dish and it filled him up.  Great portion sizes!    This is located in the Boardwalk area of University.

When we ordered our hot pot our server put down a not quite folded up creative loafing under one side to try and \"level it out\".  For one thing, this kind of made one side spring loaded and another, I'm thinking anything would be better than a creative loafing.  I mean, I guess a bottle of liquor or a gas can might be more of a fire hazard.  She ended up finding a different burner after we kind of laughed at her.  We got the seafood hotpot.  Everything was great, but if you aren't an experienced cook, you might not find this as your best option.  Mussels, scallops, shrimp, and calamari are all very finicky on cook times.  The fish balls and veggies are much more forgiving.  A great meal, but like I said, we knew how to cook our seafood.  I'll be back and back again.",

    "text": "Today was my first time at Saigon Bay, and I will say that I really had a VERY hard time contacting them. My plan was to order my food a head of time so I would not have to wait during lunch time. I called three time from the number listed on here as I was reviewing all the reviews and no one answered. The first time someone picked up then hung up, and I said to myself maybe they are extremely busy. I called again and it continued to ring and ring same as the third time. SO I still decided to go because I was craving some Pho and its cold and rainy today.  When I arrive I was expecting it to be a MAD HOUSE.... however there were all of 5 people inside and that included the servers. I immediately asked, \"do you all not accept order during lunch time?\" She replied yes we do why? I explained that I have tried calling multiple times to plan a to go order. After providing my thoughts on this situation my food came out within 7 minutes, During that time I had the opportunity to look around the restaurant. It wasn't as clean as I would have liked, and I will suggest that they spend sometime reorganizing and cleaning their bar area a little more. Being that the bar is the FIRST thing you see when walking into the doors, and you can see behind the bar its not appealing at all.   This is my feed back on my first experience at Saigon Bay, I maybe back only if I'm able to order over the phone to save time and if I'm craving Pho while at work..",

    "text": "I don't live in the Charlotte area. I drove down from Winston-Salem and wanted some food after an IKEA trip on a Saturday around 12:45PM. I was seated quickly and the restaurant was about half full. It continued to fill up as a sat to almost totally full as I was eating.   I tried to order the coconut water but they were out. I was going to get an order of spring rolls with shrimp and pork and another one with grilled pork after reading reviews that the grilled pork was very good. The waitress said its not on the menu but she could make shrimp with grilled pork rolls for me so I got that. It was the same price as just one order of rolls. They were pretty good, I was expecting the grilled pork to be sweet but it wasn't really. They give you plenty of sauce and it's nice and thick.   For my entree, I got a regular combo pho and I told them to leave off the cilantro and no mistakes! I didn't get a picture but the basil and bean sprouts were super fresh. I'm sure it's not always the case but they looked excellent. The beef was thin sliced and the broth was really flavorful. I think this is my favorite pho place so far in North Carolina. ( I grew up in Denver where there is an abundance of great pho restaurants.) I would definitely not hesitate to stop by again. The service was also lightning fast. I got my food so quickly after I ordered.",

As a first time guest was very impressed with the time spent explaining the menu, and helping to no end with explaining the flavors of the meals on the menu.

Perfect portion and soup broth was excellent. Just the right amount of fattiness in the broth. Our toddler got the plain fried rice with egg and it was cooked perfectly. Our waitress was so sweet and kind. Reason for the four instead of five stars is because the place could be a little cleaner.",

The vermicelli salad is also very good, love their quality of meats. Also try their grilled pork summer rolls, fried egg rolls are great too.   Sometimes service can be slow because i think they're a bit understaffed for a place that is always busy when I'm there but I don't mind bc it hasn't been extremely long waits or bad service, as long as I get my food.

The beef broth is definitely good, and I'm not sure if it is just me, but the broth just doesn't taste as great as it was a year ago. Maybe a change within the owner/chef. I still enjoy eating here, but let's not dismiss the fact that an XL pho went from $11 to $12 to $14 within like two years. Granted, XL is pretty big but even a Large pho is still $12 (and regular is $10). After tax and tip, expect to drop $20 for an XL bowl of pho.",

    "text": "Usually when we're in North Charlotte towards the university, our go to place has always been Pho Real.  However, one fateful day, we found them closed and needed a quick, close alternative.  All of our friends swore by this place, so we knew we had to try it.   Upon entering, it was a little surprising how few people were in the restaurant.  Aside from us, I think there were only a couple other tables seated.  Since this is a small pho restaurant on the Charlotte, NC boardwalk, we figured we could let it go.   Man, am I glad we did! We were greeted by a friendly server who started us with a couple glasses of water and an order of the spring rolls (or summer rolls in Vietnamese restaurants, the ones wrapped in lettuce, not fried) that were some of the best I've ever had.  The meat was seasoned immaculately, the peanut butter sauce incredible.   Seriously, order these.    The pho was fantastic, and don't let my lack of exposition fool you.  The broth was very sweet with just enough savory, and it was well packed with noodles and meat (I always go for the Dac Biet, with all of the amenities).   Overall, this place is a great stop for pho and Vietnamese food overall.  The menu looked pricey at first ($10 for small, $12 for large, $14 for x-large) but large is a huge portion, equal to x-large in most pho restaurants and well worth it.   Make this your next stop and you won't be disappointed.",

I got the bun thit nuong which I've had before and it was pretty good. However, it was AWFUL this time. Chicken was so dry that I had a hard time swallowing it. Same with the noodles. As for the fish sauce, it was flavorless. There's also supposed to be herbs in bun thit nuong. There was only the really cheap iceberg lettuce.   It was so bad that I couldn't even finish my food even though I really did try. And I had to sit there and wait a very long time for the waitress to get my check. So not only was the food horrendous but so was the lazy customer service. DO NOT waste you time and money here.",

I couldn't find their health rating score easily posted from my seat. I meant to look for it again on my way out and forgot. So I looked it up when I got home and their most recent one was a 90. That's pushing it and I could definitely see why.   I used to highly recommend this place but not so much anymore.   It's disappointing because the food is good.

We had to shout because he was on the other side of the restaurant and didn't want to come to us. He said no we needed three. We signaled with three fingers, he said okay. He came to the table with one check. We stated again no we need three separate again.  He brought us our three separate checks. We waited for someone to come back to get it but nobody came. There was just one other table at the time. The whole time we were there, there was only one or two tables with like three or four servers, it wasn't busy. I used to be a server so I would be more understanding if it was busy but it wasn't. The servers were just talked to each other or on in their phones. I ended up going up there with our checks to pay. After that he came back with our checks and didn't even bring any pens, luckily my friend had a pen in her purse. I enjoyed the food but because of such neglectful service I will not be back.",

    "text": "During a rainy week, on a rainy day I decided to enjoy some Pho at a restaurant that I am not familiar with. I was greeted pleasantly by gentleman and ordered water with lemon on the side before proceeding to the restroom to wash my hands. The water was delivered with the lemon on the rim of the glass and I noticed steam coming up from the glass. I touch the glass and it was hot. I am not sure what kind of misunderstanding is water with lemon on the side consTrue to being hot water (within a drinking glass) with lemon on the rim.   Also, due to my severe allergies that are disturbing to me and probably to any waiter, Carol, my waiter and I came up with the B7 broth (no animal broth) with shrimp and scallop and regular Pho noodles. Notice there is no plural on \"scallop.\" The shrimp was a good size as they did not shrink but the scallop was very tiny and there were only two (looked like one cut in half and shrunk to bite size).   Being that this is the first time I'm having Pho, I have no other other comparison to review against.  In summary, the meal was a delicious.",

Three other tables were sat around me at the same time with multiple people, and they all ate, paid, and left before I was even halfway finished with my soup.  Also, the pho was mediocre at best for the price; way too salty. I'm sure there are other Vietnamese restaurants to try in the area; don't even bother with this place.",

    "text": "Pho please! Saigon Bay has amazing pho and excellent service as well.  I went with a friend of mine who knows good Asian food and I was very happy I did.  I have never had Pho and he had some great recommendations on flavoring Pho to your specific taste.  We ordered the PH TAI (Pho with beef round), GI CUN (fresh spring shrimp rolls), and COM C BIT (pork plate).  Pho tastes great by itself, but adding lime, hoisin sauce, and cilantro really amp the flavors.  In addition to the Pho, we also ordered the pork plate with a variety of ways to prepare pork, but the chargrilled pork chop was crazy good. The service was very friendly and helpful.  I will absolutely go back.",

    "text": "About a year ago, the quality and service here was awesome.  Now, the service is horrible and they have gone completely stingy on the quantity and quality for things like meat.  I used to like this place so much, I've brought & recommended my co-workers here who wanted to try Vietnamese dishes for the first time.  4 times, we ended up waiting like 30 minutes to get our food, let alone another 30 minutes to get our appetizer and 10 minutes to have a waitress/waiter come over to place an order.  The last time I went there and ordered Bun Bo He and asked for extra blood cubes for which they charged me, I only got 3 in the entire soup.  Then my co-worker got 2-3 slices of beef in his pho?  Like really??  Not to mention, our spring roll came with fish sauce and the fish sauce cup still had the freaking price tag on it.... I am assuming the cup was not even washed prior to using it for customers since there were no signs of paper deterioration from rinsing or cleaning.  My co-worker had the exact same price tag on his.  So today, I ordered food to go for my family and I.  We ordered  Bun Dac Biet and seriously...got about 4 pieces of small cut spam, 6 thin slices of bbq pork and the rest was cold noodles....  Now, I can handle disappointment 4 or 5 times for myself and embarrassment for recommending this place to my coworkers, but since I got this for my parents as well.... and they got something like this piece of **** for an entree I paid for more than what was provided..umm NO I am never going back nor do I recommend anyone eating here.  3 times should have been shame on me.",

The broth in the pho is delicious and flavorful. They give you so much meat! Which is unusual in most restaurants.
