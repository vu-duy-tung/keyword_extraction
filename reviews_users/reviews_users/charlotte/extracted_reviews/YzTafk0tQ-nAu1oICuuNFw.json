They have a great menu with many different choices so everyone in your party is bound to find something they would like to order. I don't go here that often because I don't like being so close to the tables around me, but when I'm looking to save some money while not sacrificing quality, this is my go-to.",

This is of course not a fancy restaurant or \"fine cuisine.\"  But the service was great and I would recommend to anybody who wants some reasonably priced tasty Sushi and doesn't have a lot of time.

Even the ambiance of the  place is muted from what I remember in the past.  Had dinner on a Wednesday night and the place was not very busy.  I agree with a prior review that the weeknight crew must not be the A team.  There did not seem to be any urgency from anyone.  Our dinner was just that... an average dinner that I would have or could have prepared at home.  No spectacular or overly fresh ingredients or even tastes that I could have said were awesome.  My sushi was un-inspired and well... just ok.  The fish was not sashimi quality or fresh from the freezer.  My selection turned out to be a small rainbow roll on a really big plate.  If anything the plate selection promoted my feeling of disappointment in the size of the roll.  I really did not understand the approach for the vegetable tempura.  It must have been the creation of a chef on a limited budget.  Think cut vegetables from a bag pressed into a box form, battered, deep fried, and sliced.  I actually wondered what they used for tempura batter and it was over cooked and dripping with oil.",

I only tried a little bit of sushi itself as a shared appetizer but it was pretty good. The chicken and noodle stir fry type dish was good. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed. I didn't feel rushed but with being a newbie I could've used some guidance and education on the different types of items on the menu and what to expect. Overall it was better than I expected though I'm not a huge food buff when it comes to trying new and more exotic things.

The quality is good. I've tried almost every sashimi and roll on the menu, and have never been disappointed with the quality of anything. Obviously there are things I like less, but that's just preference, not quality. 4. The selection is good! I mean, if you're a sushi snob, you might not think so, but I just want fresh, good tasting fish and rolls. Also, I love their red pepper appetizer- SO good. 5. It's reasonably priced! I love that I can gorge myself on fresh sushi for a reasonable amount of money! I've been to plenty of other sushi restaurants across America (and in Charlotte) where I've paid double or triple for the same amount and quality of food- and have come to realize that I was paying for fancy decor, not better quality or bigger portion size.  Look, it's not a fancy date night. It's a low-key, strip-mall ambiance.  If I have one complaint, it's that they only serve sodas in a can, so I can end up spending more on Diet Coke than I do for one of the less expensive rolls! I wish they'd get a soda fountain instead.",

Even though it was a Sunday (early) around 5 or 6pm, we waited for a table and service was super slow.  Good thing we had the time to kill and our server was nice enough.  There was some confusion of how to split the check and she seemed to take forever with sliding our plastic forms of payment....  (only because she was correcting the splitting of the checks which was nice).  Overall, it's a solid place to get sushi if you are in the area.  I would not go out of my way to go to this Sushi 101.  It's a bit tight with the receiving area right when you open the door - makes it a little awkward if you are waiting for a table.  Personally I am a fan of the life-sized portrait of Gwen Stafani in the Sushi101 off of Park Rd and Woodlawn... but this one has some local art and R2D2 on the walls.  Parking can get a bit crazy since the traffic flow around the restaurant is rather odd and the spaces are angled.  A big plus is that Yoforia is right next door so it makes for a short stroll for dessert.",

    "text": "The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the very first time I went there, the sashimi was the best I'd ever had. I've been twice since then and last night was the last straw. My guess is that they've changed management or ownership. The hostess wiped down the table in front of us by spraying the cleaning solution on the table, without even bothering to move the soy sauce and sriracha bottles out of the way. When she seated us, the table was sopping wet and still very sticky.   Then came the food. It was a group of five of us and among the orders were yaki somen with grilled shrimp, three sashimi platters, a combination sushi platter, and a bowl of chirashi. After waiting 30 minutes for our food, the noodles were the highlight of the meal. The sashimi was warm (as usual), and the chirashi was the saddest I've ever seen. It was a gigantic bowl of rice with nine measley slices of warm fish and three slices of cucumbers. I'm a huge fan of chirashi and try to order it at every sushi restaurant I go to, in order to find the best. This was the worst.   A simple tip to them: close the doors to the sushi refrigerators after you've taken out the portion you need. Doing this one simple thing will keep your fish much colder. Or serve it over ice. Although, serving it over ice would probably result in the fish swimming in a pool of water by the time it got to the customers, since they are so slow.",

I'm no purist, because I do love to experiment and try new flavors. But dropping a roll of perfectly-rolled sushi into a deep fryer is blasphemy, in my opinion. So... for this reason, I was hesitant to try Sushi 101 because I feared it would be another trendy sushi spot (I avoided any place with deep friend sushi for that reason). Anyway, our usual sushi spot was going through some management changes and the menu changed, so we had to branch out and try new places.   My family is pretty predictable. The 9-year old boy loves ramen noodle soup with chicken and no veggies. The hubby loves sushi and ramen noodle soup with all the veggies they can fit in the bowl. I skip the soup and just eat sashimi and maybe a hand roll or two, a ginger salad or some edamame.  We found Sushi 101 to be a really pleasant surprise! As you can imagine, we skipped the deep fried sushi (and now, I will step off the soap box)...  Their noodle dishes are wonderful. I love how you basically build your dish. Pick your starch (noodle choices include udon, buckwheat, glass noodles and ramen... or rice), then your protein, then your \"style\". They can make it into soup, a stir-fry or even a \"don\" style which is over rice. LOVE this format!  The sushi menu is extensive and satisfying to any sushi lover. For the purists, you can get a lovely sashimi. The fish is fresh and expertly prepared. Their presentation, even for the simplest of items, is lovely. The nigiri sushi rolls are great, and the portions are great for one, or to share (if you order a few). My only complaint is that there's just a little too much rice on the nigiri, but that's no biggie. I am in love with their Half Moon, which is a lightly broiled scallop concoction, it just melts in your mouth and leaves you begging for more!  They do have a full bar, wine list (not extensive), sake and Japanese and domestic beers. The sodas are served in cans, which I've always found to be a little strange, but, again, no biggie. Just different.  All in all, we love the service, the location and the menu. The food never disappoints, and this is now one of our regular sushi spots. It's best at lunch time, because you can get in and out in less than 45 mins!",

If you can't sit on their outdoor patio, get it to go, bring a blanket and have a picnic. I did however, come here on a Sunday night last week and found it super relaxing. It was a gorgeous night and it was very quiet. We sat on the patio and very much enjoyed an evening of good sushi. I was suprised to see they now have noodles on their menu. Maybe they've always had noodles and I've never seen them before. I ordered the ramen noodles with mushrooms and veggies in broth. It was very good however I felt the sodium level hours later when my body began to puff from the salt. I also ordered my favorite sushi rolls, the professor vu and the pandhandle. Both tasty as ever. Great chocie for cheap sushi.",

Our server was a little lacking, but the sushi rolls we partook in (Cali, Philly, Rock&Roll) were fresh, huge and rolled really well.  I had the chicken hibachi and the manpiece had the salmon. We were shocked at how much food was on the plate (it's good warmed up, True story!) and really pleased with the taste and quality. The salmon is definitely worth having each time you go - it's got a glaze that is spot on!  The bill came to $40 after coupon and with so much food, that's totally cool in my book. Not a quick, cheap lunch place but a really nice place to pop into after exploring the shops in The Promenade!",

When I ate here a few months ago, we found some of the food (noodle bowl) flavorless and lacking, but some food (yakitori sticks) tasty and very reasonably priced. Tonight, I was disappointed all around. We had another noodle bowl, bland and flavorless as before. The yakitori was previously $2 for 2 skewers and is now $4 each skewer. The average adult could consume 4 sticks and consider it an appetizer. Moreover, because they don't bring everything to the table at once, I didn't realize until we left that we were shorted three skewers from the bill I paid. The ahi poke was okay, but not worth $12 for a tiny portion. The restaurant is also extremely loud and hot, and our server forgot to refill our drinks. All in all, a sad show and definitely not a repeat.",

We haven't been approached for drinks or water. Incredibly hard to capture the waiters attention. The family of five behind us left after not being paid attention to.   To the owner: we get that you want to save money and not hire a hostess or extra waiter, but at what cost? The patrons are unhappy and that keeps their tips low. The food is not good enough to keep attracting customers. Fix your system because the poor waiters are suffering and you're just driving customers away.

There is a great selection of rolls and they even do noodles and yakitori.   The atmosphere is light and airy with a view of the folks making sushi out front in the dining room.  Service is prompt and friendly.  A solid four stars.",

I will definitely be back, we had a great meal here and had tons of leftovers for lunch the next time. Great little place.",

    "text": "Not the place for noodles. Take it out of the name.  While technically they offer noodles (ramen, udon, soba), there are three preparations and then proteins you add. The stir fry or over-rice might have been fine. The \"any style\" broth is not worth the money. With water at lunch I paid $14 plus tip. The bowl is as big as a large pho at a Vietnamese restaurant. The broth tastes like maybe some miso was added to some water, and that's about it. Then raw vegetables (onions, carrots, scallions maybe) are added along with the protein. The soba were fine. The grilled beef added nothing to the soup. The veggies required fishing out. I left about 24 oz if broth in my bowl. Yes it was fine. Thanks. Thanks. -- didn't want the conversation. This was nowhere near the unctuous ramen you find at a location dedicated to the craft.  Stick with the sushi. It's probably pretty good. Since I didn't try it I'm giving 3 stars. The broth and noodles needs to be reworked. The place is clean and the service is friendly. No complaints there. And it's not too noisy, at least with a rather scattered lunch crowd. Hope they can take it up a notch. Hate to lose a noodle place because there are so few.",

But then they brought adult food first. The sushi rolls I ordered was ok, but the Udon noodle is definitely not how Japanese restaurant will serve. It was horrible. The bill was brought to us, with 18% tip automatically put on it. Seriously? For only a group of five, plus food quality was not up to the level and service was slow and terrible. First time to check it out, already decided will never go back there again.",

What I could not accept is what I witnessed as I waited another 20 minutes for our order.  There is no sense of urgency whatsoever.  Chefs, staff, all employees walking around as slow as turtles.  People everywhere waiting on orders.  It was infuriating.  I asked to speak to manager and when he finally sauntered over he said, do you want a refund?  No!  I want my food 20 minutes ago.

I do wish they'd change the spicy tuna to be less about the MAYO and more about the spicy tuna inside - otherwise, the noodle bowls are quite tasty and continue to be a favorite for my 8-year old. We'll likely venture back in next year and I can only hope they get it together. The service has been spotty the last several times as well - but it's obvious they're struggling for staff (we've had a different host/wait-staff person every time for the last several visits).",

Once we got to the table she slammed down the menus and walked off. Didn't even say anything. Our server was friendly and gave suggestions. My husband got a salad and although it was big, the core of the lettuce was in there as well as a lot of white lettuce. The sushi was good but it took a very long time considering how slow they were. Also, I got the surf and turf roll and the meat in it was very small! The steak was teeny tiny! Decent sushi but nothing memorable.",

When she came to ask if I wanted a to-go container, (since I hardly ate any). I said that I didn't because it was not good.  She replied \"Oh\", and took the check with my charge card!

They have possibly the best teriyaki in charlotte. It's grilled over an open flame and then cover d with a sweet thick sauce. The stir fry vegetables are to die for. The specialty sushi rolls are excellent as well. We really enjoyed the tempura, great crunch without being too thick.",

I believe it's because of their fryer ventilation system is insufficient so the grease is in the air coating everything. This place needs professional cleaning everywhere, including the ceiling to get that nasty smell out. Reminds me of Cinebarre theater's smelly problem, too. But, after u sit at your table, the smell is not so overwhelming. Still, it really needs sanitation.   Sushi rice prep is the key to great sushi. Unfortunately it wasn't prepared correctly but still edible. It seemed like the rice was yesterday's or just not professionally cooked.   I had the chirashi rice which had nine sashimi pieces (three of each kind). The salmon sashimi was warm which was worrisome for it is raw. Fortunately I didn't get sick that night but still sashimi should be served cold, not warm like it must've bn laying out for a while.   Usually shredded daikon tsuma (white radish) complements sashimi but this time it was served with shredded carrots which I suppose is the establishment's choice but I usually enjoy traditional daikon tsuma after the sashimi.   The shredded carrot didn't compliment the after taste of eating sashimi for me.   For the price of the lunchtime chirashi, it was reasonable. I think it was $13.95?",

Two issues tonight, 1st - there just wasn't a lot of flavor in the spicy tuna roll. No little kick in the sauce. And 2nd, and more importantly, it seemed that the rolls are getting smaller. The spider roll had 5 pieces. I swore it had more the last few times I've order it.  It was still very good.

    "text": "I ordered Chirashi Sushi at this restaurant and totally disappointed.  It was not even close to what it suppose to be.  If all Sushi 101 serves Chirashi Sushi this way then franchise owners should do something about it,  its so wrong. If your customer didn't even eat more than 2 bites,don't you wanna ask what was wrong???.  Green Tea was over priced for just a tea bag!  There is no japanese sushi chef there, which I find most of Japanese restaurants in Charlotte have no Japanese chefs.  I am Japanese and I guess I just make/cook at home. Oh Miso Soup was good by the way.",

There isn't a lot of creativity here with the selection. All that said, its a staple to us and we will always continue to go to the restaurant. it's also worth noting that it is a very family friendly restaurant.",

    "text": "Just got back from dinner at Sushi 101.  Not sure I'll be going back.  We arrived around 5:30 and there were only at most 6 customers in the restaurant.  We were promptly greeted by the very friendly hostess. So far so good.  Then out comes our server.  She was more interested in brooding hanging out behind the curtain than taking anyone's order. When she finally did get around to taking our order  it was \"what do you want.... ugh... fine....\"  We ordered various sushi rolls(California roll, philly rolls, spicy tuna, crab roll, and some other roll) and a plate of fried rice and a side of spicy mayo. Well the sushi came out after a few min.(super fast Sushi chefs) but the server pretty much just dropped it on our table and ran away Ignoring the fact that we had 2 empty drinks and  NO SPICY MAYO. We tried for about 10-15 to track her down to but she was no where to be found. We looked around and realized we weren't the only unhappy table.  Seemed the only people who worked there we could find were the sushi chefs and felt it a little disrespectful to ask them for spicy mayo and refills.  Needless to say the service stunk, after reading the other reviews It looks like this may be a common theme for sushi 101.",
