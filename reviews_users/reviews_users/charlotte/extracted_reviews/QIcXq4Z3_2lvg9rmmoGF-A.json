We did, however, have to wait a little bit for our drinks to be brought to us (even though we could see them sitting on the bar). Our food only took about 10 minutes to arrive. So overall, the experience was not bad! I will be back the next time I'm in the area on business.",

This location is definatly under staffed! Salad bar was empty, a lady did come out to refill everything, but 3 customers had to wait for her to fill the salad bar in order to get their salads. Food looked good, & there was plenty of food. The cheese grits looked like a baked potato & the grits were hard, ate them in chunks. Cheese biscuits are always good! Went to check out & they could not run our cards to pay so we either had to run them by writing down our credit card #s or pay cash. Never do this! They will have your credit card # & can attempt to purchase items with your card! We paid cash & left. Probably will never go back to this location again! Be warned!! Credit card not being able to run sounds like a Server scam to steal your card number!! If this restaurant does not fix these problems it will be shut down soon!!",

First, I was rudely put on hold for more than EIGHT minutes. I finally gave up and called back. The second time I called, the phone rang in excess of 12 times before someone finally picked up.  The order was not ready when I arrived at the scheduled time. After waiting five more minutes before finally getting the food, I started to leave before realizing that they didn't give me the appetizer I ordered. I then had to wait another 5-6 minutes for them to make the appetizer. When I got pack to our hotel room, I realized  that they had not given me the side that was supposed to come with my sandwich and had only given my wife one of the sides she ordered. At this point, I gave up because I did not want to drive back to the restaurant again to get two sides. The food, by the way, was poor quality and lukewarm. Probably because it sat so long while they made the appetizer they missed. All in all, this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in years.",

    "text": "So I was out in the Steele Creek area today... don't ask. I'm glad I was able to step in to Ruby Tuesday for three reasons:  1.) Salad Bar -- I miss REAL salad bars, back in San Diego, well to be correct anywhere in California, they have fine establishments like Souplantation, Fresh Choice and Sweet Tomatoes... these are FULL blown salad bars with everything under the sun as vegetables, pasta (both hot and cold), breads/muffins and tons-o-soup. I truly appreciated Ruby's salad bar today. Since moving here, I've be completely overwhelmed by the fried this, the fried that and it's all served with RANCH on top. So two stars for the salad bar for sure-however they should check the lettuce once in awhile to change it out  2) WiFi-- Damn I was so surprised! I sat in the bar as the restaurant was slow and I saw that most of the customers where seated in the bar area and then I saw everyone with their laptops out! WTF are you kidding me! I was do darn happy. I love this idea, but unfortunately while seated I had a flashback of doing work in an airport restaurant because my effing flight was delayed because they could find the pilot -- and YES this happened!!!! Twice at that.   3) Adult like atmosphere--I love'd the fact I didn't have to listen to people chatting on their iPhones/Androids (LOUDLY) about why or why not their boyfriends suck, what horrible customer service they received at Nordstoms, or whether or not they should go to the doctor since it hurts when they piss...  I truly loved CNN on the 8 tvs... I loved having news in the background, somewhat cool bar music, and great wait staff... truly they were all great!   So all in all I will give this RT 4 stars... I'm going to check others nearby as I would love to have a cocky while I surf.   For now, this Cali girls gives Four stars to this salad bar... but while always be in search for the next big one to ride... Salad bar that is.",

With the exception of the hostess, the entire staff was back in the kitchen. Bad food and bad service. Gas is cheap, drive an extra 10 minutes and go to a different location.

Our server Kelly was stingy with the tiny biscuits they serve and only brought us 2 biscuits to share for 2 people.  The biscuits are good but are literally the size of one bite. Other servers were serving 2 biscuits per person to their tables. I had the petite shrimp plate with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The food was good but I felt a little ripped off about being charged extra for asparagus since the plate does come with 2 sides. There were maybe 5 small spears of asparagus on my plate. Our drinks were refilled promptly and that was good. Oh, I also think that $3.50 is too much to pay for a raspberry lemonade.",

Our server was very attentive and actually seemed to care about his job. We seemed to sit there for about 45 min waiting for our food but the staff came by several times and appologized for the wait. The manager offered up some complimentary goodies. Once the food arrived all was forgiven, at least by me. I ordered the Ribeye. I have to say, I have paid as much as $60 for a ribeye before and this one was pretty close to same taste. Obviously it wasn't a 20oz cut or anything huge but it was good and cooked properly, Medium! My wife on the other hand did not have such great luck with her steak. She ordered some Asiago Sirloin or something like that, medium well, and received an unevenly cooked hunk of cheese covered steer. Needless to say she was not happy. Management handled the situation again and all was good. I would eat here again and give them a chance to show me how they operate with a smaller party.",

From no hostess and finding my way into the bar, bartender seeing me and no reaction to the typical question \"What are you having tonight\", this place misses the service mark. A server (maybe the Mgr as he had on a different colored shirt) did come see me after I got up and headed to the bar to get order and retrieve my own beer. After the food was delivered that was it for any interaction with staff. I did get up and ordered and received beer 2. I had the Triple Play, greasy shrimp and chicken strips with chewy ribs. The high point was the cold Coors Light, the bar server after no contact through the complete meal, picked up my empty plate and asked if I wanted desert, I smiled and said no thanks. I will not be back, it's a shame as it is close to hotels and would be a business travelers stop for dinner. Many other choices, my recommendation would be to choose another. Why is good service and good food sometimes so hard to come by? Other RT's are great so it's not the brand, it's this location.",

When I was finally able to order they modified a cheese burger and charged me for customizing, charged me for a gluten free bun, and then charged me extra for the avocado even with removing the cheese. They wouldn't allow me to use the garden bar. Worst experience ever! Do not eat here if you have food allergies. They are completely unhelpful and actually annoyed with questions.

I was professionally dressed and took a shower, so I don't know why I was relegated to seating hell.  There's a glass door, so I was blinded by the light (wrapped up like a deuce...), the young lady that was waiting on me attempted to pull the rickety shade down to block the sunlight, but then the manager took care of it.  Which solved the light problem, but every time the door was opened (8 times while I was sitting there), I got a shot of the sun and a gust of wind that blew everything not weighted down on my table around.  The seating... sucked.  But the booth was comfy.    The salad bar today was meh.  The greens (they have spinach, an iceberg mix, a springier greens mix and then a mix of everything) were looking a little ragged.  There was a lot of the tough white part of the iceberg lettuce in the mix.  Peas and ham were sitting on a liquid of some sort that wasn't terribly appetizing.  But, there is a huge selection of items on the bar, and typically they replenish it pretty frequently.  Lettuces, cucumbers, green peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, carrots, edamame, peas, broccoli, some mayo based salads, many different kinds of dressings, bacon, croutons, diced egg, etc.  I piled up my plate and it was good - although drenching things in blue cheese dressing always makes them a little better.  Service was fine and friendly.  She brought me a couple of their garlic cheese biscuits, which are small but quite tasty.  I didn't require much attention today, but she did a good job.  $7.99 for the salad bar is a good price.  I made two trips and feel I got my money's worth.",

When we sent them back the brought back the same fries and said they just came out. I never had dry warm fries out the grease. Then the rookie waitress apologized and said \" I'm sorry you didn't like the fries\" like my taste buds were wrong for wanting hot fries. If I'm waiting 20 minutes for a burger and fries I expect them to be fresh. The salad bar was on point, I saw the attendant refill and keep it up consistently. Yet the lack of common sense from waitress was astounding. I hate wasting my money on lack luster service and food.  Extremely inconsistent!!!I will never go to this Location again. I will try Another location.   Ps not independence location, they served me water with soap and a piece of a sports sponge in my glass",

    "text": "While I've grown up alot since I worked at Ruby Tuesdays back in college, so had the establishment. No more is the place decked out in local and pop culture memorabilia and Tiffany lamps, it's a little more chic than it used to be....for a chain restaurant at least.   It's been a long while since I've been to Ruby Tuesday but I recently signed up for their email list which opens the doors to many perks such as BOGO coupons emailed to you, special offers and a birthday meal. I like birthdays. I like meals. When I saw I had a coupon for a free handcrafted burger soon to expire, I know where I was going for dinner!   The place is a little obscure in location-right in the middle of a business park off Arrowood and 77. You can see it easily from 77 but when I exited on Arrowood, a bit confused where to turn so I follow the red. I turned into Oak Hill Business Park then made an immediate right and there I was. It was a little slow for a Thursday night but what can you expect on a chilly night. I was dining solo so opted for the bar where I could watch hockey or hoops on one of their many tv's and was soon greeted by the bartender. She told me the selection of draft beers they have on hand (about six to seven with two types of Sam Adams, wooooo!) and was quick with a pour. I was the only chick in the bar and felt like the only one not there on business since there are three or four hotels within a 1/2 mile radius.   Even though I was getting a burger of sorts, I still scoured the menu and saw they have Sunday brunch served until 3PM, news to me, will have to check out! I got some complimentary biscuits while waiting for my food--think smaller, less cheesy knock off of Red Lobster's cheesy biscuits. Tasty and just enough to hold me over until my meal.I got the Alpine Swiss Burger which came out in no time along with their endless fries. The fries were crispy, fried, salty goodness. My only complaint is now they they are a tad more chic, the ketchup is served in ramekins and not a bottle in sight. I put ketchup on everything so I like to have a bottle within reaching distance but they were happy to offer me more when they saw I was running low. And the burger? Succulent with just enough toppings to make it fun yet not fall apart. I think the menu said it was 8 oz and it was a lot better than I expected.   I had a pleasant experience and look forward to going more now that I'm getting coupons on the regular. I'm not really big into chain restaurants but if you can offer me values for giving you business, I will be loyal. I've got my eye on the salad bar with the sneeze guard for my next visit!",

You do have to pay for the while entree so it's about 10 bux but that means you can load up on as much as you can fit in the box! Fresh veggies, pasta salad, potato salad and usually fruit salad. I do recall that the last time I went there NOT for a salad, I got fish and the cauliflower mash and that was delish.",

Massive selection of their burgers on the high-gloss menus, all come with their overly salted \"bottomless fries.\" They have a wide selection of other items, including salads and entrees, but the emphasis here is on the burgers.  I really like Ruby's for the salad bar, which I think hasn't changed in ten years. It's the same stuff at every restaurant, not that it isn't a fresh alternative to the usual cole slaw side items at other places.  Drinks are refillable and I really liked my Ruby's Tea. The wait staff always seems so dang young, though that could just be me. ;-)  It's casual dining with a very full selection at the bar. Would I come here again? Sure. Consistency is nice sometimes. I can't find a thing wrong to say about the place, but it's just not a \"five stars\" restaurant.",

Why tell us that it would be ready at 9:11 when it wasn't until closer to 9:40? It absolutely seemed like they waited until we arrived and paid to start assembling the food -- which, even doing so, shouldn't have taken so long to make.   They gave us the food and, when I checked the bag, there were no plastic utensils. When I asked for them, they said they had none -- except for spoons. What?! We were staying at a hotel after a long day of driving and just wanted to take the food back to the room, eat/relax, and head to bed. The server's answer was for us to ask the hotel for the utensils. (Yes, of course the hotel had them, but how could the whole restaurant be out of plastic utensils and not even mention this, etc.?)

No one there wants to work nor cares about making money. We waited over 10 minutes and no one came to take our drink order or food order. There was this one girl who had tons of ear rings walk buy a few times but she never spoke to us. I assume she was a waitress. Hard to tell though because they don't wear name tags or uniforms. We ended up leaving and going to O'charley's. It was there we were greeted with friendly service and a smile. We had a good server and good time. So if you want good food and good service, go to O'charley's!!!trust me you'll be glad you did.",

Visiting a known chain restaurant like Ruby Tuesday's, you know what your going to get and you know the standard. Having worked in a similar chain I know how these restaurants are ran. When service is not so great and food is not very good then I blame management.  Ques o for an appetizer was not bad as long as you don't mind old, stale, and chewy chips. That is just gross. The salad bar is always good at Ruby's right? Well yes, as long as the employee is continuously filling the empties. Only here they were filling up half empties and leaving items such as cheese gone. Salmon and mash potatoes are all me! Only the mash was cold. Layer of dust on the lampshades just grossed me out.  I usually like a Ruby Tuesday's meal, so I was very disaponted at this location. I will not be back here anytime soon.",

Upon arriving I had to wait for over 10 min for the waitress at the bar to come over. I finally called the restaurant from my cell, while at the bar, to get someone's attention. Upon receipt of my order I found that my portion was half what I've been served when I dine in, yet I was charged the full price of 14.99. And it was not even lukewarm. Very disappointed in my entire experience here and will be passing this on to my relatives who live here as well. Don't waste your money. If you're serving half portions then charge half price. Period. There's plenty of other restaurants in this area.",

Tomatoes and cucumbers were frozen solid. Hummus and potato salad were covered with dry brown crusts. Half the other ingredients were almost used up. Staff made no effort to restock or clean up the salad bar.  With so many Ruby Tuesday's closing the staff must want to join the unemployed.",

Literally, restaurant has 20 people TOTAL, and it takes me standing at an empty hostess stand for over 5 minutes before anyone ever walks up to seat. It then takes 18 minutes to get a drink. THEN, they somehow run out of the \"hickory bourbon sauce\", which apparently is their signature sauce, since it is peppered throughout the menu. I can assure you it wasn't because there was a \"run\" on Ruby Tuesdays.  If the server apologized one more time or \"thanked me for my patience\", I might have run screaming into traffic. If you just can't live without ruby Tuesdays for supper tonight, then you should at least manage your expectations. My rookie mistake was not checking the ratings BEFORE I got here. I can guarantee you it won't happen again here. EVER. Oh, and the best was the \"manager's \" half-hearted \"thanks\" as I walked out.  You're welcome.",

Other things that were wrong was the slooooowwww service and my other two coworkers who didn't get shrimp or the correct veggie. But that took forever to fix. And portions are tiny. You no longer get your money's worth here.  The server was so bad that the rest of the staff was sucking up to us. Constant apologies from the manager.   Every time I've been back here, it's been worse than the previous visit. If the place wasn't down the street from my work, I would avoid this place completely.

    "text": "Solid lunch spot with a great salad bar. I am still trying to figure out their pricing structure. How can soup and salad be only $2 less than a steak, side and salad? They might do that on purpose because I always end up spending just a bit more to get a dish with the salad bar as a side. However you could get the salad bar as a main and never go hungry again. There is a huge amount of choice from bacon bits to edamame. The food has always been fresh and promptly served.   Last time I went here I was my usual 10 minutes early. The person who was meeting me was about 10 minutes late. Other early birds can relate to sitting alone in a booth staring at your phone trying to look cool and collected. The waiter in this situation was absolutely great! He brought waters, and after confirming I would wait to order he still brought out some biscuits for me to snack on. It is little experiences that can lift a chain experience to an outstanding lunch.   I can be a little tricky to find with the construction. Don't be discouraged if you think you are driving onto a job site. It is probably fine until the men in orange vests start yelling.",

We arrived a little after 6:30 the hostess was able to get us to a booth quickly. However, we waited....and waited until our waitress finally came over and the first thing she says to us is \"looks like you're stuck with me tonight\" Now, I don't know much about being a waitress (ok..ok I don't know anything about it) but I'm sure there's a better intro for your customers...or maybe that's just the new \"thing\" and I'm just not hip to it.  Anywhoo on to my meal:  Pomegranate Lemonade- I was a bit turned off by the price ($3.49) a glass BUT they do offer refills and each one is freshly made. This drink is freaking delicious. Worth every penny, not too sweet or sour, just the right amount of pomegranate juice....Soooooo good! Get it! Get it! Get it!   Salad Bar- Meh. It needed to be replenished and there were toppings dropped all around the containers, some of the lettuce had browned and the worse part was that my favorite croutons were stale. Hopefully, this was just a \"wrong time...wrong day\" experience.   Spicy Fish Tacos- Welp..the presentation was lacking. But the tacos tasted great. The fish was very well seasoned, with lettuce and cheese with a delicious spicy ranch sauce.   Overall, this visit was just okay. Didn't knock my socks off but I really enjoyed my lemonade and the food was good.  So I'll make sure to give them another shot.",
