When I got home I was a little confused being from Brooklyn NY. I have never seen eggplant cooked in a deep fryer in my life. I was surprised when I took my first bite because I never had this hero chew crunchy or oil/grease shoot out like a cannon. It seems like it might have been over cooked??? I was starving so I forced myself to try to eat some more of this unfamiliar hero. I couldn't do it anymore so I threw it out. My dog would bite me if I fed this to him. I will go back one more time and try the pizza just because of the reviews but if this goes sour forgetabutit!!!!!!",

Though i started to suspect the food.  I mean MOP and italian food with a name like Carmellas can't clearly go together can they?

The place is dark, they even tinted the windows.  The \"decor\" (if I can even call it that) was confusing, bar on one side, the other side looks like Chucky Cheese (minus all the games). It's a typical hole in the wall place.  They have a decent pizza lunch special ($4.75 2 slices with a drink).  I ordered a philly cheesesteak (half).  It's a pretty big half, but unfortunately, it looks and smell better than it tasted.  Kind of plain.  The seasoned waffle fries were better, even though they're definitely frozen and bought in bulk from some food supplier.   I see that they have 50cents wings night, dollar pizza slice night, karaoke on Fridays and other \"special.\"",

Here's the deal people this is a local joint with usually the same regular patrons who all know each other and are like a family. The drinks are cheap the pie is great and the people are awesome. It is not a gourment pizza place it is a local bar with good pizza pie. The crowds vary at times to almost crazy some nights but that is what makes it fun. I can totally understand how someone may not like it but that is because they don't understand what the place is about. Hang out, meet some people at the bar and throw some darts. When you get hungry order 2 slices of pepperoni. Great place for me it is laid back and fun. You run into some local people and take it for what you want. Definetely not a corporate uptight boring place.",

I mentioned that the Panthers game was not on any of the TV's and the response was \"well it was, that's weird.\"  I ordered a house calzone.  I see they are skimping with plastic silverware but also filling the calzone with about long strips ofa whole yellow onion.  It said there was ricotta but if there was I didn't see any.  So I had a onion calzone.  The calzone was messy, and was served on paper.  Essentially, if you cut your calzone you had to sift through the soggy paper.  The kids had a pizza brought to them by the lady who was smoking in the doorway out front.  We asked specifically if they could change the channel to the Panthers game.  The response was the manager said you have to sit at the bar to watch the game.  No one else was in the dining area but us.  Also, when it was brought to the attention that the paper the calzones were served on was less than ideal the staff finally recognized maybe a plate would be a good idea.  We were almost done and we said forget it.  I can see what effect management can have on a restaurant.  Any issues such as games on TV's were not remedied but answered by essentially that's too bad.  It was Sunday football and I was afraid it would be too crowded.  I see why it was not and I will not go back.  By the way, we have been going here for many years and I would have given t 4 stars then.",

She only said, \"What can I get you ?\" We ordered 4 waters which she brought about 5 minutes later. Come to find out the restaurant was extremely understaffed and she was the only waitress working. We walked up to the bar to see if they had any beers on tap, and they didn't just by observation. We couldn't ask a staff member because the bartender was on her personal cellphone and wouldn't even acknowledge us. Finally, we decided to leave prior to ordering and went next door to the Flip Side Cafe who sells locally farmed produce and all locally grown foods. It was amazing and the best decision we could have made. We will definitely go back to the Flip Side Cafe !!!!",

We drove down a bit and I remember driving by Carmellas a few times.  My kids like pizza so here we are.  Upon walking in, it seems a bit sketchy.  Let me set the scene....you walk in and the Jukebox is playing WAY too loud, and the music is like \"house boomy type music\" you know, like I just stepped into BAR CHARLOTTE?  Alas, no pole or anything but you know what I mean.  There is a bar section on the left hand side and for a 5:30 on a Sat. evening, there were people drinking and carrying on like it was last call I was waiting for someone to call out over the PA \"If you sitting stand, if you're standing get the hell out\".  On the right was like a twilight zone....completely transformed and is a sit down section with families eating pizza.  We pass by a few arcade games, foosball table and sit down.  Their menu is quite diverse with everything you'd want to see pizza, specialty pizzas heros, pasta dishes, the works.  We ordered a white pizza and I had a calzone.  All were surprisingly good.  My little one who, frankly, doesn't eat hardly anything scarfed down 2 slices of pizza while this may not mean anything to you,  to me it means the pizza was spot on!  My calzone was typical chock full of ricotta, mozz, ham and mushroom.  Good flavor.  The food, like I said was good.  The service was very good.  Others have found it non existent but they must have fixed the issue or at least they did last night.  Our server was upbeat, helpful and was attentive without being overbearing.  Our food came out lightning quick and we were in and out within an hour which put us right on time for the game.  I can take or leave this place, the food was OK but there are better places in the area for similar food.  I think Carmellas needs to establish it's identity and stick to it.  All in all, it wasn't bad.",

Don't ask about your food that u ordered at the same time as your friends or Stephanie will rudely remind how busy she is therefor making sure you know how unimportant you are to her. The DJ is fantastic and crowd is fun and diverse ...Stephanie is sometimes decent but come on days when she isn't overwhelmed!",

She brought my drink and salad quickly. But then it took 25 minutes for the two slices of pizza to come (at least 15 min after a person who arrived after me got his-I really don't like that.)  The salad came in a small clamshell container - your basic pre washed salad mix. The pizza slices (one veg and one cheese) had obviously sat for some time. The server was over extended and was having trouble multi tasking. I felt pretty invisible for a time.",

The manager, Kathy, is absolutely 100% unprofessional, she yells and cusses at her staff in front of the customers, talks down to everyone. Some of my regular servers express how mean and unprofessional she is. Surprised she has kept the staff she has for as long as she has considering the abuse they endure each and everyday. I enjoy Tuesday dollar pizza a beer night. The bar tender is great, but the manager really makes me rethink visiting there everytime I go. I myself have been a manager in the restaurant business and I do not approve of her managing technique and skills, or lack there of really. In my opinion this place would do triple the business of they found a better person to manage this place. My visits will continue to decline until someone with a brain fires this incompetent woman. Until then, find another place for pizza and beer like empire if you want to avoid drama and constant yelling from her big mouth.",

It never seems to be the same...and the servers sometimes appear \"on edge\".    Overall, it's not a bad experience...or...should I say...it hasn't been yet.

    "text": "Before we ventured out to Scarowinds we stopped in for a quick bite. I thought the place itself was just fine. I didn't notice blaring music (it was 6pm on a Saturday evening), and there was a clear divide between the dining area and the bar- making it family friendly. The menu is huge - everything from burgers to pasta/pizza to gyros. I ordered the chicken parm which came with a salad and pasta on the side.   I really enjoyed the salad - the ranch dressing was homemade and it had some nice pepper jack cheese sprinkled on top. As far as my main dish I found that their sauce was too sweet for my liking - and there wasn't a whole lot of chicken in the dish , it was mainly the \"side\" of pasta that came with it. The chicken itself was really good so I was dissapointed to find the side made up the bulk of my meal. I had a bite of the strombolli which was really delicious - so I'd stick with the pizza/calzone/strombolli route if I were to return.  Service was quick and friendly- no issues in that department. The only thing I found a little odd was that all of the containers including our  silverware, entree and salad dish were disposable .My mom's entree was in a to-go box that sat on top of a regular plate so I know they have dishwashers.  It seems like  they would save a lot of money by just getting rid of these when people dine-in...it also would be way better for the environment -as I cringe to think how much plastic they waste.   Overall it was a solid choice to grab a quick inexpensive bite before heading to Carowinds.",

The pizza was undercooked and the meatballs on it were dry and over cooked. I saw a big piece of what looked like cheese but it turned out to be a big piece of raw dough!!

The menu had quite a few Mediterranean items and I was gonna have what they called Spinach footballs (spanokopita)., I think. I decided on wings with a side salad. I asked the bartender Stephanie what wings she suggested. She said Babalo and the Garlic parm was good. The babalo is a mix of Buffalo and barbecue. I ordered them cooked well, no flabby skin. They were nicely coated with sauce without being drenched and they had a great mix of the the two flavors and the garlic parm was delicious. I NEVER order those, but she said they were finished off in the oven and the flavors were baked in and it made them crunchy. Wow! So goood!! She suggested a drink that was Strawberry lemonade. So good. Could've used a little more liquor, but I had to drive home, so it was fine. Side salad was boring, but their blue cheese made up for that. Baldie had the pizza, wasn't my favorite, too thick and doughy. But then again, I'm used to New York pizza. I'll go back for the wings tho.",

The wife orders a house stromboli,i order the ruben, and my daughter gets a couple slices of cheese pizza. In addition, the wife and I get salads.  I like my salad first, like most people. Well, it came out with the meal. Now, my food is going to get cold waiting on me to scarf down a salad. This was not an issue.  The wife's stromboli was sitting in a pool of grease. So much it was inedible. My daughter has to wipe the grease off her pizza. My ruben had no dressing. Everyone makes mistakes. I look for our waitress. She is nowhere to be found. Mind you, we are the only table in the restaurant. I decide to go to the counter and service myself. She ignores us. I have to make several more attempts to get assistance, and she continues to ignore us. In between, she fills the ice machine.  I head to the counter to get my check, speak with a manager, and post my bill. I want nothing free, I give feedback, positive and negative. We can't improve if we don't know.  No manager, just some guy helping out. Convenient. The hispanics in the kitchen are laughing, probably at my expense. All he says is sorry. I expected nothing less. Now we have to find the waitress to get my bill. She won't even give it to me. She hands it to the guy and spend off. Now he can't run the register. He goes to find someone else. After an additional 5 minute wait, I can pay and leave...never to return.  So I had to post one star, but it was not deserved or earned.",

The employees spent a lot of time hanging out in the customer entrance area while tables needed to be cleaned, food cooked, etc. Definitely not a good experience. We will not be going back :(",

I like mine a little crispy and that they were. However I always think I'm eating an inferior product when there are broken bones. Wednesday special was 50 wings.   Seat yourself...very casual. Bar hopping crowd in the bar. Video games in the center for kids and big kids. Then there is a dining area in the back. Good for any and all.   High ceiling and beer signs/racing memorabilia.

Instead of ordering at the counter and finding a table like at the Whitehall location here a waitress has you pick a table and takes your order. The windows are tinted and the decor had a western bar feel (fun fact - there is a whole separate bar section as well). Like Peggy said circa 2012 - if you wanted to do some hard middle of the work day drinking this place has that feel.   The pizza lunch special can't be beat - two slices and a drink for less than $5. I added a side salad for about $3.50. The salad came out first in it's prepackaged tin on top of a plate. It was a pretty good salad with fresh greens and lots of interesting things that aren't lettuce, including a peperoni. My pizza came out reasonably quickly and was okay.   The price point is biggest draw for a return visit.",

I stopped in on a random Wednesday evening to pick up my gift card and decided to grab dinner while I was there. The staff was friendly and attentive in giving me time to look over the menu. I opted for the pepperoni calzone. My order came out in a timely fashion. The calzone looks small but honey, it is a huge portion and quite dense. The flavors are classic and the touch of ricotta was appreciated. I will def be returning to redeem the remainder of my gift card but even after that, as two locations are close to my home; and more importantly I've learned that they have great daily specials.

    "text": "I brought my family here on Thursday night, 50 cent wing night. We ordered some hot wings, they were pretty good. I like the flavor of the sauce, nothings better then a tasty hot sauce. My kids ordered the kids French bread pizza, it was a really large portion that they could have shared but it was so inexpensive I didn't mind. We ordered the vegetarian pizza, for me there was too much cheese but everyone loved it otherwise. I dunked mine in the wing sauce, delish.  All in all we had a good experience, the bar area was packed but the dining room was slow. I was happy that it was a semi loud place so my kids weren't a bother :) that's always a plus when you have two kids under 4.   Point is... we will def be back.",

I got a call an hour later and was told nobody answered our door. I told him we've been here and nobody has come to the house. We revalidated our address and it was another half hour until delivery. The driver said nothing to us and just gave us the food. Cold and extremely greasy pizza, mozzarella sticks with no cheese inside and decent spaghetti. The pizza was so greasy it was wet and my family wouldn't eat it. Really disappointed I wasted money on this.",

    "text": "Carmella's is pretty good for a lunch stop. I've been here at least three times, and counting, during my lunch hour. It's quite close and service moves quick enough for the allotted lunch hour that so many of us are limited to. They recently updated their menus to a large 11x17\" size front and back with thick, strong lamination - a much needed improvement. And they fill that menu top to bottom on both sides with lots of tasty options.  The food selection isn't especially unique, though perhaps it is harder to find. The salads with grilled chicken are usually piled high and they're not your everyday bland salads with just three toppings (iceberg, tomatoes and cheese). They actually give a healthy helping of mozzarella cheese, big slice of tomato, a banana pepper, a whole slice of green bell pepper, thinly sliced red onions, cucumbers and more (depending on which specific salad you order). I've seen co-workers order the meatball subs which are weighed down with giant meatballs and a pile of marinara. I recently had the black bean burger. Like a heathen I brought insult to vegans everywhere and had them add bacon. It was a seriously good sandwich considering the price of less than $9.  The service can be spotty here though. Out of the three times I can clearly remember visiting this restaurant, twice I've had the wrong thing placed in front of me when it came out. And as I mentioned above it comes out quick enough for lunch hour but it can also push it a little close to the cut. Nonetheless, I will definitely be coming back several times for lunch!",

The pizza was REALLY good but it would have been even better if it showed up HOT. It was a Saturday night so I give them a pass on the hr delivery time but next time we order it better be HOT!",
