    "text": "Honestly, I'm saddened to even have to post this but other consumers should be aware. I ordered pizza from this location through an online app, as I have done on numerous occasions. Due to no fault of the business or myself, the order appeared on the company's end a little odd...for example there were essentially no toppings for a create your own pizza. Upon following up to investigate this issue, the lady who answered the phone indicated that it did seem weird. If the order seemed weird, why not call the consumer? Irregardless a pizza was delivered...a pizza that did not match what was ordered nor did it match the order the company actually received! Where then did they come up with what to put on my pizza?  Again, a simple call to the consumer could have avoided this issue. Upon discussing the matter further with the person who answered my call, I asked if I could get a replacement pizza (ie what I had originally ordered). Initially she said yes but then indicated that I could purchase another pizza and would have to resolve the refund issues with the delivery service separately. This seemed so confusing...especially since they made an incorrect pizza irregardless of the system error on the part of the delivery service. It's my understanding, the company gets money for the food ordered since a separate fee applies to the delivery. If a company gets your money for a pizza, I don't think it's too much to ask for the pizza you ordered.",

They greet you when you step in the place and are real helpful if you're a newbie like me. I went during lunch so the prices were really good. Nice crowd but not too packed. I guess the secret isn't out yet. Check this place out.",

We were a bit apprehensive about going in since there were only a few people in the restaurant.  Once we had ordered our pizza we were showered with attention and a welcome from all the staff.  We ordered The Big Max.  It was delicious and the sausage was especially tasty,  The assistant manager was very kind and checked in with us to see if everything was okay.  We also enjoyed the local beer that was on tap.  We hope to go back again soon.",

    "text": "We ordered takeout from Maddio's tonight online. The pizzas were hot and ready as I walked through the door, and the staff were great. 5 stars go to the staff, but here I'm commenting mainly on the food.  The pizzas were good, however not great. Toppings were plentiful, but scattered - I really prefer crumbled Italian sausage rather than sliced for one, because you can spread it all over the pie as opposed to sliced, where you may or may not get the sausage in each bite. Same goes for the artichoke. Giant chunks of artichoke were on the pizza, but rather scattered - either you get a giant hunk of artichoke in a bite or you get none at all. This may be all in growing pains, and may be perfected once the newness wears off.  With the plethora of similar \"build your own\" pizza chains entering the Charlotte market, I just wasn't all that impressed when compared to the others. Blaze Pizza is the winner in my book. Not only did I enjoy their pizza more, but they offer unlimited toppings, where you only get 3 without paying extra at Uncle Maddio's. The reason that I give this place three stars is because it's going to be hard to convince me to return here instead of going to Blaze, which essentially is the same type of pizza place, but with a real fired pizza oven rather than a conveyor cooker and more generous toppings that are more evenly spread on the pizza (oh, and there's that spicy marinara at Blaze that is amazing!).  I wouldn't avoid this place by all means, though. Still a good pie - just doesn't quite stack up to the competition IMHO.  Now if only we could score an &pizza location from DC, I'd be in heaven.",

    "text": "I walked in and it was apparent how things worked there was a large sign with the menu, over what seemed to be a food making station, and smiling faces greeting us.   I'm huge on Customer Service so this immediately made me feel like this was going to be a good experience.   The little one got a kids meal with just cheese so nothing too fancy, he ate all of it and a cookie which was impressive it was kinda big for a kids pizza.   I was super confused about what to order salad, pizza, flatbread thingy, there was so many choices. The chick behind the counter suggested the special which was a personal pizza for like five bucks.   I got prosciutto, sausage, and sun-dried tomatoes.   My bill was 20 bucks, I don't know how, I got a five dollar deal and a five dollar kids meal, and then the two cookies and my medium drink was another 10 bucks?!? I'm sure it's right, the cookies were huge. It threw me off a little, but I was getting hangry, and my kid was annoying the hell out of me so I just paid, I'm normally that annoying person who questions b/c I've noticed people get rung up incorrectly a lot!    We took our little number & my cup, his milk, & our cookies and found a spot in the cramped dining area. It's not really cramped per se but the booth are really spacious, but the aisle space it's sort of tight when more than one person is walking down.   There's a drink machine with Coke products and all your flatware, napkins, lemons, and lids & straws.   It was really clean and I like the ambience. It was upbeat and there was a good mix of people but the wait was like no time at all.   The pizza was fantastic! It came out piping hot the sauce was absolutely phenomenal I could taste the spices. It was almost like I had made it at my house myself. There was plenty of toppings and cheese. And let me tell you about these cookies! They were huge, tasted amazing, perfectly baked, and had the right amount of morsels! We got a chocolate chip, and oatmeal w/ white chocolate chips & crasins.   Overall great experience, we'll go back next time I make a Trader Joe trip because the salads looked great!!   They do say to order online to skip the wait which I might do next time that way I can look at the menu too.",

I was excited last week to get a text and email from them about a 10\" special they had (2 for $9.50). I hopped in my car to take advantage of it. I wasted my time and gas coming here. As soon as I pulled up, I saw a sign in a window that said this location is not participating in this particular special. Then I went inside and there was another sign with the same notification. I talked to a young lady behind the counter and she confirmed, telling me the owner wasn't going to honor this special. Dammit I want my gas money back and time! If you are going to text me and email me, at least put a clause in there that says all franchises do not participate and you may want to call and confirm before wasting your time. I'm pulling my rewards membership and not going back.",

For sauces, they have tomato basil, garlic olive oil, zesty BBQ, herb pesto, and more. The toppings list is pretty outrageous--spinach, steak, meatballs, roasted corn, baby Bella mushrooms, banana peppers, jalapenos, prosciutto, celery, broccoli, grilled tofu, green and black olives, pineapple, and more! And of course, the cheese!! Mozzarella, ricotta, fontina, goat, blue, cheddar, fresh mozzarella, and DAIYA, which makes THIS VEGAN GIRL SMILE AND SAY CHEEEESE!!

We tried to eat what we could of the pizza but it was soggy and did not taste good. No refund, No nothing. Bad business don't order anything from this place. They don't care about customers.",

Sometimes I have too difficult of a time picking toppings myself, but that's okay because I really like their Italian on the signature menu (tomato basil sauce, mozzarella, spicy Italian sausage, red onions, mushrooms, banana peppers, fresh basil). I love that there's a whole wheat crust option (they also have gluten free). They also have calzones and build your own salads. Want to make it quick? You can place your order online ahead of time.   Make sure to sign up for their rewards program. You get a free pizza just for enrolling (must use within 24 hours) and you get one point per entree purchased. Ten points will get you a free entree.",

I love the variety of fresh toppings that you can add to your own pizza, really truly making your own creation! If you're not feeling that adventurous, they also have \"pre-made\" creations that sounded equally delicious. They also have make your own Stromboli, which isn't something other pizza places in the area offer, along with wings and other menu items.   Overall, I was impressed with their efficiency, topping choices, amount of toppings they use on your pizza and the overall taste. It's definitely being added to our pizza night spots and we will be back.",

We called the pizza place to let them know, and the manager told us \"he didn't do it\" and there was nothing they could do since they use a third party delivery service. If you choose to use a delivery service, you should care how your food is delivered. And, if you don't, you should at least care about having disappointed customers and do what you can to make it right. Very unfortunate! Won't be back.",

Although some of the staff may not be the most engaging, their quality sure makes up for it.  My favorite premade combination they have is the 4 cheese - Garlic Olive Oil - Ricotta - Fresh & Shredded Mozzarella - Fontina - Italian Seasoning! Get a side of marinara for dipping and you're set!  If you're a meat lover and not wanting to decide on toppings, you must got with the Big Maxx - Tomato Basil Sauce - Mozzarella - Pepperoni - Italian Sausage - Bacon - Handmade Meatballs. It's a meat lovers delight!  If you're looking for something a little more unique I'd go with the BBQ Chicken. You're probably thinking that seems kind of basic or mainstream, but they spice it up just right and make it their own! It's all inclusive of Zesty BBQ & Tomato Basil Sauce - Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese - Grilled Chicken - Bacon - Red Onion - Roasted Corn - Cilantro!  Of course you still have the option to make your own and do it up just as you'd like... But beware at this chain your toppings aren't endless. I can't remember if it's 3 or 5 toppings max, but that includes the cheese. Because of that I typically stick with the premade options because they are absolutely delicious... Why mess with a good thing?!",

When he reached at the 345 S Kings Dr, Charlotte location, the pizza wasn't even ready then the guy that was preparing the pizza, started asking my husband what's the next ingredient to put on the pizza - he did not even know to make pizza, excuse me? When the pizza arrived home, half of the ingredients and seasonings were missing - to add the frustration, the dough was really nasty.neing a regular customer, today's pizza wasn't close to the jamaican jerk chicken pizza uncle maddios is known for..I would never step back in that place or recommend anyone..worse customer service too. The service had already started going downhill few months back but now with the food quality suffering it brings an end to our patronage. Highly dissatisfied!!!!! And one last thing, what ever happen to the maddios greeting? Management should be ashamed of putting together such an inferior quality product along with disinterested and untrained staff.",

While i stood and waited on my to-go order, I observed an elderly couple sitting at a table. An employee brought a box (or possibly a to-go order) to their table. Rather than a offer pleasant \"here you go\" and handing them the box, the employee literally dropped the box on the table and walked away, without saying a word or making eye contact.  The woman at the table was visibly offended (as was I for her). The woman couldn't say anything because the employee was back in the kitchen by then.  About 10 min later, I was waiting for my name or my type of pizza to be called to signify that it was ready to pick up. As I expected to get a verbal call for my order, I decided to browse my phone. Suddenly, without any verbal notification at all, I saw a pizza box flung in my direction. It somewhat startled me - it was the same employee holding my pizza box without making any eye contact. It was as though she was \"over the entire night and could care less about being pleasant or efficient at her job.\"   I reached out to get the box (expecting a \"have a nice night\")...but instead....SILENCE as she walked away). It was extremely disrespectful. I decided to just leave with my order.   I know this happened to at least one other customer and I suspect neither she nor I was the first or last to experience this kind of poor customer service that day.  I hope Maddio's has a refresher on common decency with its employees.",
