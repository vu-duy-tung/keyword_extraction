After discovering there were none really close and still craving \"mexican\" type dishes...She pointed me to Don Pedro's.  I ordered Arroz con Pollo which is my go to dish back home in Virginia. But wow, there version of this plate blew my mind. Next time I am anywhere near Charlotte I am making a special trip for this place!",

    "text": "Sometimes I just really want Mexican food, and this place does enough to satisfy that craving.  It's a little bit nicer than some of the other local Mexican places but still very casual.  It's a pretty standard setup for a Mexican Restaurant.  You sit down and get the chips and salsa.  I am not a huge fan of the salsa.  I prefer a thicker salsa with more interesting things going on in it, but the salsa here is pretty runny and ordinary.  There are lots of beverages so if you enjoy the mixed concoctions you will probably find something you enjoy.   The food is pretty good.  I most recently got the tacos al carbon which was one of the best things I've ordered here.  It consisted of sliced steak inside of corn tortillas.  It came with the standard refried beans, rice, and lettuce/tomato/guac/sour cream situation.  Lots of food!  The service is okay but not exceptional.  Our waters stayed full and our beers kept coming, so I was satisfied.  You probably will be too if you give this place a shot.",

    "text": "3.5 stars! A co-worker took me to this restaurant and I was glad to find Mexican restaurant that was truly a Mexican restaurant - not a Tex-Mex one disguised as Mexican.   We sat down fairly quickly,as it was a bit early for lunch, and we were given chips and salsa right away. The chips were hot and really good.  We also ordered the cheese dip - which reminded me of the queso from Salsarita's - it was good but I don't know if I'd go out of my way to order it again.  I'm from Southern California, we don't get cheese dip in Mexican restaurants.   Because I'm trying to be a good Catholic girl, I gave up meat for Lent, so my food choices at the moment are a bit limited.  I ordered the Camarones Mexicanos (shrimp -I'm allowed seafood) with corn tortillas.  It came out quickly and hot.  The shrimp size were decent and was served with avocado on a bed of rice, ranchero sauce, cheese, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. It was a nice, filling lunch.  They do have very good service, the servers are very attentive.   I'd go back because, so far, it's the most authentic Mexican cuisine I can find in Charlotte. And by all means, if any other Yelpers have any other suggestions - please let me know :).",

I was immediately greeted with chips and salsa, which probably was my least favorite part of the meal. The chips were just okay, not bad, but definitely not good.  However, the salsa, way to runny for my liking, and it had somewhat of a tomato sauce flavor. I ordered a house margarita, why not, it was after 12 on a Sunday, and the lunch chicken fajitas. The margarita hit the spot and definitely had a good kick of tequila. Honestly, I debated a second, ha ha! The fajitas came out sizzling with peppers and onions and just the right amount of chicken.  I received rice, beans, guacamole, lettuce and sour cream with four flour tortillas. The entree was great and I loved the beans and guacamole.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but do wish the salsa and chips were better, fresh and more salsa like. And, other Yelpers raved about the service, which I thought was just okay.  Maybe it was being in the bar, but there were other tables around me and I felt the bartender was overwhelmed.  If I am in the area I would definitely give Don Pedro's another visit, especially for the margaritea.",

Coming from another part of the country I am used to a different style of latino food but considering they made me something specifically for me and I gobbled it all down, I am not complaining.  the guacamole made tableside was delicious and the hot salsa was also delicious.  I can't speak highly enough of the service.",

Reading the review of another yelper we tried this place out. When entering the location you have the \"bar\" to the right and the dining area to your left.   Pretty nice looking bar from what I saw. I'll have to come back and pony up to it at another time.  Table Side Guac.... umm umm good. (Albeit too good. I ate way too much of it.) 2 different kinds of salsa, Thick, and Runny.  Ordered 2 Margarita's (no no no.. not JUST FOR ME.. but my gf also) = 15.00 We both ordered the number 37 (thanks for the tip Shaun R.)  I ate way too much salsa and chips (came out pretty hot.. thats a good thing). Trying to soak up the liq. in those margarita(s). Ok ok.. I \"helped\" my gf finish hers' off.   The wait was a bit long for the amount of pp in the building. (maybe 4 other tables 2 already had their food)  Food, Drink & Tip for two = about 33.00. 15.00 of the 33.00 was for the 2 drinks.. I think thats a pretty good bargain. Since I STILL have leftovers.   We came in around 2:15pm (Lunch special 11am - 3pm)  This place get the Arnold (I'll Beee BacccK) see pics",

We waited for about 5 minutes in the foyer area before just seating ourselves in the dining room. Maybe we should have picked the bar, since we ended up waiting another 15 minutes before a waiter came to take our drink order. The service did not improve as the night went on; we had to ask several times for drink refills and finally for the check.   My husband had a burrito and I ordered the Carnitas De Res. He was not impressed, but did not dislike his entree. I, on the other hand, could not eat more than a couple bites of mine. The steak had a strange plastic-y flavor. I assume it was just old meat. The cactus salad was also sad and strange tasting. I filled up on the beans and rice and we left the restaurant as quickly as possible.   Salsa's, down the street in Ayrsley, is priced a bit higher. However, the food actually edible. We will definitely be skipping Don Pedro in the future.",

The interior is well-decorated. This location is a bit fancier than the E. Independence one. The E. Independence location is more casual, replicating the scenery in Mexico.  DO NOT order the fried ice cream. First of all, the ice cream isn't even fried. It is just blobs of ice cream in a fried bowl, drenched with whipped cream, chocolate and other toppings. Basically, a sundae in a fried bowl.  I tasted my friend's strawberry margarita. It were okay, nothing special. I definitely have had better pina coladas. I guess I had higher expectations for a Mexican restaurant. I do love that they come in giant glasses. Neither of us were able to finish (weak sauce.. I know =P). I do confess that it's probably not because of the percentage of alcohol in the drinks but rather the fact that neither of us have developed tolerance lol  We didn't try the food at this location, but I've tried the E. Independence location. I'm not a huge Mexican food fan and this place did not do much to sway me otherwise. If you want a large portion for $4-$6 entrees, you should come check out their lunch specials. The dishes are filled with beans as a side item and covered in cheese. That's great if this suits your palette, but personally, I think it just results in a very heavy, awful feeling (not so great if you can't nap afterwards and have to go back to work =/). If you love freebies, you'll love this place! You'll get free, bottomless chips/salsa and a sweet treat at the end of your meal (though I'm pretty sure this is typical in most Mexican restaurants).",

(Cover the eyes of small children. This ain't pretty.)  The first bowl of chips were a bit stale. The second bowl was warm, so they're forgiven, but the salsa is too watery for my preferences. The servers are dressed up in traditional Mexican clothing. This along with the ornately carved chairs, tables, and the decor sufficiently welcome the \"adventurous white people\" to \"Mexico\", but the giant painting is a bit over the top, in my opinion. I think this is the source of the inflated rating. People who don't normally have Hispanic fare thinking this was great as a first experience. I might be white and adventurous, but I grew up on authentic Hispanic and Asian food, or at least as close as you can get in Atlanta. MOVING ON.  I ordered the steak Azteca, which comes with rice, beans, vegetables, tortillas, and butterflied shrimp, or \"Mexican prawn\", that are still attached to the shell, making consumption a chore. Quite depressingly, the steak was overcooked and bland. I asked for medium, and it was almost well. That I can deal with, but the lack of spices was an insult to my taste buds. The rice was unbalanced. One bite was juicy and perfect, the next was mediocre, and there was plenty of undercooked/overcooked rice. Didn't touch the ensemble of mushrooms, onions, and peppers. Didn't look appealing at all. The tortillas were average. The refried beans were the best thing on the plate. Too bad I don't really like refried beans. Didn't finish anything on the plate except the shrimp.  And the review was still somewhat respectable, but the flan did it. Plated horribly. Not sure if they were out of the smaller dishes or what, but it came out on an entree dish. Plenty of caramel and cream, but the flan mixture is off. Not creamy enough at all. Needs more milk, me thinks.  1 star, but they earned it. Not coming back. I've had better in small Midwestern towns with 3 digit populations. Pathetic for a large town like Charlotte. Only thing authentic was the waitress. Not coming back.",

We started off with their chips, salsa, and table side guacamole. The chips are a bit thicker than I like, but tasty nonetheless. The salsa is quite thin and the guacamole isn't overwhelming with lime and salt like some other restaurants.   The staff hasn't been very warm and welcoming, but I wasn't expecting southern hospitality from a traditional Mexican joint. They are attentive and refill beverage/chips/salsa.   My boyfriend ordered the steak fajitas and I'm a little jealous of the flavorful sauce in which they've marinated the meat. The \"fixings\" they serve along the fajitas are just the same as what is served on top of my burrito; guacamole, lettuce, sour cream, tomato with rice and beans alongside. He was a little disappointed with that, but it worked perfectly with my meal.   All in all, Don Pedro is definitely a location I will try again to see if there are even better GIANT meals to enjoy.",

    "text": "I go here quite often with the family and its always consistent. The people are friendly, the food is good. Its fairly typical Mexican fare. I think most of these restaurant's must get their menu and supplies from the same place. I went to a Mexican restaurant in Charleston, with a different name, almost the exact same menu. Azteca-same menu too.   Here you start off with free chips and salsa. You can get fresh guacamole made at your table. A nice touch. They have a great white cheese dip. Be careful not to fill up on the free chips, because you have a boat load of food coming out.   I like the Burrito Azteca (mix of chicken, shrimp), with enough cheese and sour cream poured on top to croak you. You get a giant plate with beans, rice, and your burrito. My wife got the steak quesadilla. Again, huge. My daughter got a \"small combination\", enchilada, rice, beans. My other daughter a streak fajita. We always have enough food left over for lunch the next day. And I usually leave here thinking, \"why did I eat so much?\"  Add in a cold Pacifico brew or a Top Shelf Margarita and you have a pretty decent meal.  The atmosphere is just ok. Its in a strip mall after all. But its clean. They recently installed new tables, lights, etc. The staff is friendly. They have an outside seating area if you like. I've sat there before, but tend to not like it because of flies.  All in, a pretty solid meal. Not the most healthy and not something you'll get too exited about, but pretty good. I find myself coming back, again and again.",

Ladies, in case you were mislead on size, this is as big as pizza size. The interior is big, decorated and very clean.service A+.portion size is generous and prices are in part par with other Mexican restaurants. Don't read negative reviews place is worth it. Carne asada is fashizl!!",

After we ordered he suddenly turned to rude, I guess because neither of us ordered an alcoholic drink (which he took 3-4 minutes to list and explain in detail).   The fact that their chips were stale should have been an immediate turn off but we decided to order anyway. Bad plan, I feel sick today and I definitely don't think it's a coincidence :(  The girl who refilled our chips was rude and according to the menu only the first 2 baskets of chips are free, after that they are $3. Seriously? They aren't good... who's ordering multiple baskets??  This was just not a good experience overall and the staff was not helpful or pleasant. I won't be back and I hope others will follow suit.",

    "text": "I used to come to this restaurant all the time but each time something has gone completely wrong.  On my latest visit here, they sat me in the middle with a bunch of other people.   What I don't like about the table seating here is unless you are in a booth, you are seated right on top of another table.  There may be 2 or 3 inches between you and the next table which makes conversations open to everyone around you.  So I got over the seating issue and look at the menu.  My server brings my drink quickly and then asks me if I'm ready to order.  No...she only gave me 2 minutes to look at a very extensive menu.  Well it was like 10 minutes before she came back again after that.    I decide on a deluxe taco salad which comes with guac and sour cream in addition to the salad.  Oh yeah, I ordered chicken.   So it comes out and it's a half-stale tortilla bowl with tons of shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese and slightly seasoned ground beef.  Chicken???????   I received just an additional dollup of guac and sour cream off to the side on top of more lettuce.  Do I look like a rabbit?   Oh yeah don't forget that half frozen slice of tomato.   The whole thing was so unappetizing and it tasted the same way.  I had to dump salsa on it to give it a least a tad bit of flavor.  Honestly, I've had better taco salads at Wendy's and Taco Bell and I think a chinese restaurant could do better at this.  So I can shoot myself for not going to Moe's like I had planned.  Oh yeah, I thought, this place gets so busy that it deserved another try.  Yeah right...  Moral of this story,, always trust your gut feeling.  The alternative is never worth it!",

Bring half Puerto Rican I'm used to something else. It wasn't bad. Just different. Too many other vegetables. But the portion - BIG! It can be shared.  Now I always always get the carnitas/carne with corn tortillas. Their pork is never dry. We even get it to take out on occasion when we don't feel like cooking.

The food is still good and the portions are -massive-. The plate in the entryway is what you're going to end up with so be ready. I had the Deluxe Burrito and there was a ton of it. It might be hard to tell in my picture, but buried under that sour cream and guacamole is a large burrito stuffed with chicken.  My daughter chose the chicken fajitas and there was also a lot there. Only three tortillas, but plenty of chicken, onions and peppers.  Drinks were refilled. The queso is no longer a problem - it probably wasn't poured into a cold bowl so it stayed cheesy until our entrees arrived.  Service was quick. Table-side guacamole is available too.  If you're looking for fancier Mexican, you've found it. Don Pedro is a step above the usual Mexican places along Burrito Way.",

    "text": "I stopped in for lunch with a few co-workers. The place was pretty packed when we arrived which is always a good sign for a newbie!   While we waited we checked out the menu and lunch specials. The prices for their lunch combos was pretty reasonable! Once we were finally seated we got the chips and salsa. I wasn't a fan of either, the chips were fine (I guess) but just not my personal favorite...and the salsa was way to watery for me!   For lunch I ordered the Ranchera quesadilla. It comes along side rice and beans, with your choice of chicken or ground beef and then gets topped with sour cream, guacamole, tomato and cheese.  My plate arrived to the table hot so that was a huge plus! The portion size was just right! But the chicken could have used a bit more seasoning, I wasn't a fan of the beans (covered in cheese) and the rice was a bit crunchy.   Blah.   So for now this place is just okay! It's certainly not the best Mexican I've ever had but I'm at least willing to try another dish and a margarita and see if they can't win me over!",

Everyone at the table loved their meals (arroz con pollo, shrimp fajitas, chorizo con huevos), but we all agree that the salsa is a little thin and the chips a little thick for our taste... trust me, though, that didn't stop us from eating several baskets full! Parking can be a challenge, especially for bigger cars because the spaces are quite skinny. The little strawberry chip with whipped cream at the end of your meal is nice, too. Also, they never mind splitting the check for you (a requirement for a work group lunch). When the weather is nice, there is a small patio (covered), too.",

Their queso is well-flavored and a good thickness for dipping the warmed tortilla chips into.  I ate at least 1/2 of the bowl on my own.  My meal order of carne asada was prepared to the requested temperature and was juicy and tender, absolutely delicious.  The beans and rice were standard mexican restaurants beans and rice.  Dessert of xangos (fried cheesecake) was the perfect icing on the food coma that I sent myself into.    Price was as to be expected.  Service was very good and the restaurant was clean.",

I was so excited to find a traditional Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, especially down the street from me. I love me some dirty Mexican food and when I say dirty I don't mean gross. I mean the down home loving traditional Mexican joints where you order a number 1-10! And that's exactly what Don Pedro's is. The food is awesome and I've always had a great experience.   My favorite is the chicken burrito (house special), two taco combo or the chicken fajitas. Yes I've been here a lot ;-) All of them have been awesome. The food is always steaming as it comes to your table and the servers are great- however there have been a few times we've had slow service, but the food made up for it. Hence why I gave this a 4 star review instead of a 5.",

After what was at a minimum the worst hangover of my life kept me indoors and in bed for roughly 18 hours, I was beyond ready for something scrumptious to bring me back to life. I had this grand idea in my head that authentic Mexican would somehow do the trick, and boy did it ever. My wife didn't mind this plan, as Mexican food is her favorite form of sustenance.   My go-to; 2 enchiladas & a taco, extra rice with no beans. I believe this is the #22, and it's something stupid cheap like $10.95. I almost always get two meals out of it. I recommend upgrading (for $.50) to the pulled/shredded beef instead of ground beef. The shredded chicken is also moist and packs a great flavor. Their rice is tasty & never dry.  Don't hestitate to make a stop here on your next jaunt down in the Ayrsley area.",

Once more guest began to arrive I asked if I could purchase the fresh table side guacamole. She took forever to put in the request and knew she hadn't done so, because the guacamole guy was standing near our table. When I asked how much longer before the table guacamole she said, of itll be a few more minutes, again the guy was right by our table doing absolutely nothing. I did not appreciate this at all, she made it appear as if she had already put the order request in so we had to wait longer for the fresh guacamole.   Our food was delicious, everyone enjoyed what they ordered, except my uncle and grandmother who order burgers. They mentioned that it was over cooked and hard. It was an ok experience at Don Pedros, its been better in the past but this time was just ok.",

My favorite part about it is the fact that it is huge so I've never had to wait for a table, even with a large group.   I would not call their food gourmet by any stretch of the imagination, but you get what you pay for. They also have Dos Equis Amber on tap and serve it in two different sizes, which is nice. Their margaritas are your classic sugar mix, again, you get what you pay for.  If I want a huge pile of fajitas that aren't going to break the bank, or a table big enough for me and 19 of my closest friends in the Steele Creek area, I go to Don Pedro's.",

Figure they may be sort of a big deal since another Mexican restaurant i frequently visit mentioned Don Pedro's one day in anger as if Don Pedro's was their biggest competitor. So i said \"self\" lets go see what the hoopla about.   When i arrived the one thing that stood out to me here was the employees all were dressed alike in gear from their culture which i off the bat thought was cool. The next thing that strikes me for sure is the bar. Someone put some kind of thought into the skull as the backdrop of the bar etc.  Now lets get to the food. You guys i am so mad because i accidentally deleted all of my pictures from my phone except for my drink, which i had a mango margarita. I ordered a chicken/rice and beans platter which was pretty good, the rice was a little dry but everything for the most part was OK.   The staff here, everyone and i mean everyone was super friendly, and attentive. I don't know rather or not this is protocol but once i finished up my meal my waiter brought me out what appeared to be some type of sweet dessert chip with which cream and strawberries on top. Small gestures always win almost anyone over. I have to make it a point to come back and try out other meals on the menu.",

It's edible but not my favorite thing on my plate.  The chicken here is great!  It isn't filled with onions or peppers like other restaurants seem to do with chicken.

They were all super delicious and satisfying but I will say that the cheese dip needed something to bring out the flavor. Perhaps salt? For my entree, I had a chimichanga with a creamy white sauce poured on top that came with rice and beans. It was freshly hot and absolutely delicious! The staff were awesome as well! Our waitress was on top of the game and was always checking in on us. There's a man pulling a guacamole cart where he makes fresh homemade guac, I didn't try it but it looked very good! Overall, I highly recommend this location for their excellent food, service, and staff!",

I have only had food that I liked the very first time that I came and unfortunately it was a \"daily special\" menu item never to be seen again.   Oh but on that blessed day how fortunate it was that I had one of their delectable flavored margaritas!!! OMG... they are probably some of the best flavored Margaritas I've ever had in my life. Great Frozen but 10 times better on the rocks!  I live for Thursdays when the flavored margaritas are good drink special of the day. There's nothing like an amazing drink when you have that \" I'm only one day away from the weekend but I need a drink now\" feeling. Their regular Margaritas are also discounted on Wednesdays. Either way you can't lose.  If you come for the drinks you'll have a great time. Just know that the food leaves a lot to be desired but a great drinks make anything taste great!",

    "text": "What a complete rip off! I come here all the time with coworkers and on evenings with my family and friends, but on the day we had the ice storm I decided to come in on a Sunday evening because they were open even though they were empty. I ordered the queso and salsa with chips to go as I have in the past. This time they charged me $13 for half empty queso & salsa with only 1 small bag of chips- an extra bag would be $2 extra. You get more queso if you don't eat out- not equal. This is pathetic & when I complained that they always fill it up, the server who was sweet & I still tipped, said the chef said that's how much they give. No it's not & I was the only customer and they failed me. I doubt the management even cares or will see this, they just lost a customer. Never eating here again.",

    "text": "Probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Came in with a party of 6 and was seated quickly. Our server came up and was polite, we placed our order and the food soon came out. Had the vegetarian burrito, which had yellow cheese and a tomato sauce that tasted like Ragu. It was also cold on the inside and plate was hot, probably microwaved. Food for the rest of he party varied, some enjoyed it and others didn't . Had one issue with an item and sent it back, not a big deal or uncommon but it was to them. When the check came out, the item was on the bill so I asked the server why something we didn't eat and sent back was still on there. Server then proceeds to get snappy and tried to tell me that they could not remove the item and that is something that was supposed to be removed when we sent the plate back. She proceeds to go and talk to the manager about removing the item and he takes it off but then decides to now add 18% gratituity. I then ask to speak to the manager to ask why gratituity was added after I simply asked for an item to be removed. The manager Fernando, did not come to the table and the server instructed me to go to a table where he was sitting running a karaoke event and taking with one other server. I proceed to walk over and ask the manager about the grat, which he informs me was added because it was taking the waiter \"extra time\" to correct the check and bc they regularly grat parties of 6. I understand the grat for parties of 6+ but why not add the grat on the original check and why choose to add it after I asked to have something removed ? He then proceeds to start raising his voice and then starts to talk in Spanish (which I also speak) to the server saying he would just take off the grat to make us happy and so that we would stop \"complaining\" because he didn't know what our problem was. He was extremely unprofessional, rude and the side comments were unnecessary. Simple issue that he decided to make into a big dramatic fiasco, as he's screaming and talking trash about our party to the servers.",

So, it took them awhile to serve us all. As I watched I never saw an employee on the floor that was not doing something. Nobody was hiding in a corner ignoring customers.  Food was good and arrived hot. Their table-side guacamole service was a nice touch and the guacamole was tasty. Hot chips. Ordered a combo plate with chili rellano, beef taco and cheese enchilada.  Did not expect the rellano to be stuffed with beef, but it was. I was not impressed with the meat in the relleno and taco. It was seasoned ground beef which reminds me of fast food tacos. Does that ring a \"bell\"? They had an interesting hot sauce. I think it was the juice from canned green chilies and some chopped onions and other seasoning. Was not bad. Everyone else at the table was happy with their selections. They frequent this place and were familiar with the menu.  I will be back if in the area again.",

I preferred La Paz's enchiladas but now they are gone....so these will do. The food is sort of one note- cheesy.. Speaking of cheesy their queso is some of the better I've had (I am not an imitation cheese fan). The guac is just ok - wish they spiced it up a bit more and added more lime.   A co-worker of mine ordered the veggie quesadilla - and honestly it was beyond even what a large plate is and was filled with huge chunks of once frozen veggies - cauliflower, broccoli, green peppers, onions. She said the veggies must have been cooked in a thicker oil (not something like olive oil) - and the flavor was odd. So  if you don't eat meat I think a better option (taste and sadly even calorie-wise) is the cheese enchilada.   This wouldn't be a place I would go out of my way to go to, but I go as a group work lunch and haven't been  disappointed - not the best,  not the worst....just plain ok...",

I placed an order over the phone the food was ready when I arrived. There was 1 guy that I saw helping customers, he greeted me and wanted to help but when i said I called in my order he said someone would help me. There was an employee sitting in the back playing on her cell phone.She looked up and made eye contact but never stopped what she was doing...... The guy was busy working I looked at the lady for 10 minutes before she sent someone over to help me. Keep in mind the lady she sent to help me was waiting other tables. The girl came to the counter and stated a price, no hi how are you nothing just 10.67..... I explain that I have a groupon she took my phone and walked to the back...... So now Im standing at the front and my phone is gone. I wait a couple of minutes but when I see other people coming over and them swipping thru my phone I got upset. So I walked to the back and asked what was the deal, while taking my phone back from some random man . They stated that they are looking for the code. I understand by why did you take my phone. Couldnt you have written it down and come to the front where I was standing and look for the code. The man became upset and told me to go to the front and someone will help me. So I walked back and who comes to help.... The lady who was too busy with her phone to help me in the first place. She then gives me an attitude explaining that it was a dine in groupon. I totally understand that and I explain that the last time I used it, it was to go. She says it wasn't her and she doesn't care.I gave her the .78 cents, I didn't get change and its safe to say I will NEVER go back there. Service is horrible.",

Seriously this place is legit good. I am bitter about the salsa, but I will live. Decent service(it seems like when you ask they don't acknowledge you they just walk away and you hope they bring you what you want). All and all good stuff. 3 out of 5 ain't so bad.",

Huge portions, you will need to come hungry or take a bunch home to eat later.  For the prices you get a lot.  Margaritas are also great!  I'm usually a little picky about Mexican food, so I can say this places is unique and delicious.  Table side Guacamole is an interesting new twist and the wait staff was so polite and attentive (but not overly so which is nice in my opinion).",

    "text": "A Friday night favorite for my husband and I since we moved to Charlotte- we started out going to the Tryon location, but now visit the Pineville location on a regular basis because it's closer to our new home. Both locations offer excellent service and great food at reasonable prices. I think on the whole I give the edge to the Pineville location, as they actually have better rice and a few additional things on the menu that the Tryon location doesn't offer.  If you're looking for some of the more authentic dishes, ask to see the picture menu- it offers several dishes that aren't on the english menu (at least at the Pineville location).  If you're looking for value, you cant go wrong with the combination platters- it's a ton of food for super cheap (especially if you go for lunch). And of course, every meal starts with free chips and salsa (two different kinds, a True salsa and a pico de gallo). They also make all their tortillas fresh, and at the Pineville location you can watch them being made at an open station near the kitchens.",

I have tried many different entrees and have never been disappointed. The restaurant is not going to blow you away but it will not disappoint either. The service is always good. The restaurant is clean and modern. Overall price/value is good. Good spot if you are craving Mexican fare. This is a great spot to bring someone for their birthday. Let the hostess know in advance and your birthday person will have a pleasant surprice. Good place for groups.",

    "text": "While this place is in a shopping center, it's a whole lot bigger than you'd expect, & the food is pretty good as well. While I do have the perception that Mexican food is really tough to screw up, Don Pedro's is above average in the taste department. I think the only negative is the price, when you can get just as good Mexican at some lesser known places for cheaper.  There's plenty of seating, so the lunch crowd usually moves through pretty quickly. The seating area is also pretty wide open so you can take quite a bit of people along with you. They also have a separate bar area as well as outdoor patio seating.   They serve the typical mexican dishes & everything is pretty tasty but won't blow you away. They have free chips & salsa which is always a plus & two types of salsa as well. I like their pico salsa better than their runny stuff, but both are fine considering their price.   Don Pedro's is good if you're with a large lunch group during work, the food will satisfy you, and you'll get in & out pretty quickly.",

Their lunch specials are really affordable, most are $5.95 and they serve salsa and pico de gallo with their chips.  Yum!  The wait staff is friendly and quick and they wear little Spaniard-esque uniforms.  I had a chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo and was satisfied with the selection.  At the end of the meal they brought out some type of cinnamon/raspberry sauce giant chip with whip cream on top.  Nice little meal ending surprise.",
