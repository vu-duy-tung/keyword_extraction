I decided to eat here because of the modern furniture, good music, T.V.'s (playing the Little League World Series), and extremely warm greeting by staff (Jorge). I'm rating them a 3 Stars because I ordered the International roll, which had over cooked mushy rice, somewhat undercooked eel, and a spicy mayo that tasted like Miracle Whip with pink coloring. I would return for the atmosphere and good service alone. While I'm at it I'll get a Sapporo and give the rolls a second shot.",

The rolls had more fish than rice and that was great. Tasted fresh. I had the ocean roll. The ginger on the side though see less tasty and old. The wasabi was not a bright green but dull green, not sure why or was it too old? On any case I would eat there again. It's better than the fast food places, but it will cost some more as any other sushi place.",

I am not familiar with Charlotte or North Carolina in general, but I am hoping this is not considered quality sushi by the population. I appreciate that the staff did not charge me for the orders. Please Yelpers, avoid this joint at all costs. If you're that hungry, I would even recommend the Burger King next door.",

The cashier asked me if it was to go, I said yes, but asked to sit down so I could eat a few bites before my flight. The extremely rude cashier said I couldn't sit down because my order was to go and said I could sit over at the general sitting area across the way. This was done even though there was at least 5 empty tables at the sushi place. I walked over to the general sitting area and realized they didn't offer me chop sticks, soy sauce or napkins. I had to walk back to the cashier station, gather those items and then hurry to eat the sushi outside my terminal. Worst yet, the sushi tasted like it had been made yesterday, being mushy and dare I say stale. Overall, a bad experience with terrible food. Next time I'll try any of the other quick to grab food available at the Charlotte airport. Perhaps the other establishments allow you to sit at their tables after buying their food.",

Although the California Roll was just fair, both of the other rolls we ordered were excellent--the Southern Charm (featuring snow crab, cucumber & avocado topped with eel sauce and not so authentic but tasty crunchy fried onions--fantastic), and Sushicado, (fish wrapped around avocado) choose from salmon yellowtail or tuna--salmon was lovely. Our waitress, Olivia  was sweet and helpful. Unfortunately, I couldn't give a 5 star rating due to the excessive amount of plastics/disposables used here-- EVERYTHING from the cups to the chopsticks, dipping bowls and plates! Just seems unnecessary. I'd happily raise the status to 5 if that were to change.",

Service made the airport feel hospitable. Don't eat sushi without alcohol, especially at the airport",

    "text": "Had about 30 minutes before my flight was boarding, and I was pretty hungry.  I hemmed and hawed about picking a place to eat, but figured, what the hell, airport sushi - I'm a masochist.  Suprisingly, it was much better than one would expect.  I ordered the First in Flight combo - spicy tuna roll, yellowtail nigiri, and spinach salad - and a burr.  The spicy tuna roll could have been a little bit spicier, but nothing some wasabi couldn't remedy.  The yellowtail was actually much better and melted in your mouth, I mean, my mouth.  Spinach salad was pretty standard except they serve up quite a bit of it.  All for $15 bucks, which I thought was pretty reasonable given (a) sushi, and (b) airport prices.  I overlooked the Shotgun Betty burrs that they had on tap.  It's a funky tasting beer, but so good.  It has a bubble-gum/banana taste... and it's so good, I promise.  Anyways, I think it's Lone Star Brewing or something like that, and they don't have a huge Charlotte presence AFAIK.  I'm glad that there are other places than Carolina Alehouse that carries it.  Now I can tell my buddy from Indiana about airport Bettys.  dmo out.",

Not only was the service promot and pleasant, but the food was better than i expected.    Although it wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, it was decent, which is more than i can say about any other airport sushi.  The only thing I didn't like about the was the heaviness of the rice; it was laid on real thick which made it hard to eat a piece without picking off some of the rice.  I had the CLT roll which was massive, and a little bit spicy.  The food prices are reasonable and the portions are hefty; however the wine is rather pricey ($9 for the house wine & $15 for the recommended Red).  My glass of vino was not served in a glass- but rather a plastic pyramid looking structure that definetly did not complement the wine.",

The salad had avocado piled on it and a refreshingly tasty dressing over a bed of actual lettuce (not iceberg garbage). My sushi roll was filled with chunks of real crab. It was much spicier than I was expecting, but still excellent and I would order it again. Plus, it didn't cost any more than I would expect to pay outside the airport.   I'm glad I wasn't swayed by the negative reviews, as there's no way I could have eaten as delicious (and healthy) of a meal anywhere else in the airport. Most of the bad reviews deal with the pre-made items in the cooler, and a few mention the eel. I steered clear of both of those, and couldn't be happier with my decision. You should do the same!",

I didn't see any shrimp tempura in the freezer so I asked if she could make me some and yes she made it immediately. She was polite. I was able to watch her prepare my food. The sushi tasted pretty good. I wasn't expecting top of the line considering it's an airport. Expecting top of the line sushi at an airport is like going to an amusement park and anticipating five star Filet mignon. It did the job and tasted pleasant. The price was decent considering it was at the airport and sushi. There was plenty of seating nearby and some with plugging areas to charge your items. Enjoy!",

The sushi bar was not fully open when I came but they have a decent selection of prepared sushi in a cooler in front of the sushi bar. Veggie rolls made their presence known to my eyeballs and my selection was made. Take the container to one of the center stations to pay before the sushi bar opens. There's a sign that will tell you so along the sushi bar. However the wait time at the center station got a star removed.  Picked a spot to sit and enjoyed some pretty decent pre prepared container veggie sushi. It had crisp, not soggy veggies and rice even after putting low sodium soy sauce on it. That's a plus in my book. Add in some wasabi and it's got a great kick. Nice to find plant based sushi that was flavorful even from a package. I'll consider going here again.",

Just previously frozen tasting, watery, mush posing as fish. No amount of soy, wasabi or ginger could save this one. Seaweed salad was ok but I expect a little more satisfaction after I shell out $20 bucks for something. I didn't even eat it all and I was starving. I threw the rest away.

I have gone to many of their locations; from Cleveland State University (which they up-charge the students because they can) and the Heinens location all in Ohio. The sushi is just too sour (the way the sticky rice is prepare.)  They give you very little wasabi and wherever they source their fish -- the fish is very pale in color and tastes sour as well. Maybe the sourness is done to mask the flavourless fish and other ingredients.   Seriously this place is a disgrace to Japanese food and culture.",

Wicker Park at Ohare remains the standard for sushi in air port.",

I'm also happy I've found this secluded spot to get away from the crowd.",

Had the CLT roll... beware it does have a kick. The sushi seemed not fresh. Nothing was wrong but it just didn't melt in your mouth the way you expect good sushi to melt. Edamame was delish and Pinot Grigio is tough to screw up, very good!   Prices are typical airport gouged prices but the portions are sizable.",

I should have read the other reviews before purchasing the cold, stale pre-made items left sitting in a cooler.   I was not impressed.   I guess the waiter went on break and the chef wasn't saying anything about the menu.  They need to eliminate cooler and just have made to order.  The area is nice.   Several lounge chairs and couches with tvs and wall plugs for recharging batteries.   There is a view of the runway and has top 40 music playing the background.    The airport offers unlimited free wifi (45 minutes at a time with no limit for more minutes).      Hissho is located in terminal D.    Worth checking out and waiting for the waiter to serve you.",

Tuna or salmon is dressed with spicy sauce then place on top of whole grain chips.  I love the taste. It is always fresh as they are always busy. The menu is pretty good offering more than the typical airport choices. I haven't try the rolls but they all look very good. they offer quick carry out options as well.
