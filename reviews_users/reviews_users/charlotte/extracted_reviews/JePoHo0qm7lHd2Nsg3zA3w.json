    "text": "Excellent cheese selection.  Beautiful homemade pasta and sauces...I can't say enough about how good every single sauce I have tried is, served with their perfect pasta.   I've had to edit my review of Pasta & Provisions for one simple reason. Their store is so unorganized, and their staff so lazy and unmotivated that it is a chore to try to shop there.  I can't remember the last time I went to their store that all of the items that I purchased made it home in my bag. They will randomly leave out at least one item every trip.  I don't know if this is an effort to increase their profits by stealing from their customers, or if their front counter staff are just that incompetent. But, even with a concerted effort, I still end up at home unpacking my bag, wondering how exactly that I don't have the bread I purchased, or the cheeses, or the ham... or whatever it is that they have charged me for that they didn't put in the bag.  Don't try to call to complain either! There is NEVER any management or owner there, and you will talk with a high school aged person, who doesn't know and doesn't care.",

    "text": "Eat pasta, run fasta.  At least that's the logo at this local Italian specialty grocer and pasta maker.  No doubt pastabilities (ha!) abound for carb loading here, whether for your latest endurance run or for your Sunday dinner food coma.  This is an old-school grocery with a small but amble selection of Italian meats, cheeses, oils, and sweets.  They also have a small selection of wines , but the show stoppers are their fresh pastas and sauces.  In other words, everything you need for your Italian feast can be had here.  Rather than peruse the cooler and the freezer, I encourage you to check out the large blackboard behind the counter.  All the pasta options and sauces are clearly laid out and explained.  Just make your selections and tell the staff how much you need or how many are eating.  For fresh pasta, the register staff sends your order back to the kitchen staff on a little zip line, who fills the order and zips it back to the register in just a minute.  Raviolis are pre-made and frozen.  Sauces are either frozen or fresh and in the cooler.  No worries, they all taste great.  Fresh salad greens and focaccia breads are also usually available, and located near the register.  Do check out the wide selection of olive oils and other jarred goodness located pin the tiny aisles to the right.  Pricey?  A little; but you'll find things here not available at any other mega-grocery in town.  This is a local gem that any foodie will put on their must-see list.  Luckily, they are just as accessible for those looking for a quick mid-week meal to make back home.  Buon cibo!",

It's like a traditional Italian deli/pasta shop right here in Charlotte.  Too cool!  So many fresh ingredients from all the fresh cut deli meats, to the freshly made pasta as well as roasted veggies, sauce and of course the deserts!  I will definitely be visiting this place more often in an attempt to expand my culinary horizons!  Note:  For the single guys out there that might not know how to prepare a great romantic dinner....this is your one stop shop!  Come by here and you can find every ingredient you need already made up so all you have to do is throw it together and BAM! You'll look like a superstar!",

    "text": "*Advanced apologies for this being so long! :) \"Sono nell'amore\" - I'm in love!  I wanted to burst into a child-like conniption right on the floor because I couldn't buy one (or more) of everything...someone hold me.  But I digress!  This is a FANTASTIC little shop - a lotta stuff packed in a small space & it seems to be quite popular.  Parking was a smidge daunting, but there is more in the back...but be careful since the tiny ally only allows for one car & you might get in the \"I'm trying to leave but no I'M trying to come in\" face-off!  The rear lot is shared with Providence Sundries & was pretty full when I was there around 12:30ish on a Thursday.  Found the staff to be SUPER helpful, friendly & knowledgeable, especially as to which sauce would pair well with what pasta (all homemade in house btw)- one girl (didn't catch her name) offered to show me around the store & explain things when she learned it was my first time in, which was a huge help (although the shop is relatively small it's still kind of overwhelming at first).  Once the tour was over I wandered about on my own to soak it all in.  The atmosphere is easy with music playing in the background at juuust the right volume and a view to the kitchen in the back.  One cool thing they do is whenever someone orders any of their fresh pasta, they send it sailing from the kitchen to the register up front down a long wire attached to a clip (watch your head!) - FUN!   PS - you choose how you want your pasta cut: Angel Hair, Spaghetti, Linguine or Fettuccine.  They have a huge menu board up front that spells out exactly what's in each pasta, ravioli and sauce, so you know just what you're getting.  Plus you see how NATURAL everything is.  I walked away with THE most delicious Greek White Bean Spread & loaf of Rosemary Focaccia bread (which I am munching on as we speak)...just marvelous.  Also picked up a pound of fresh garlic/rosemary pasta cut fettuccini style (only 2 mins to cook!), house-made alfredo and pomodoro sauces, and a pound of shrimp ravioli (prebagged).  They even gave me a treat just b/c it was my first time there - how awesome is THAT?!   They're my new bestest friends :)  For those SIX, local, house-made items, my total came to $30 and change.   Taking into account I was supporting a local business and getting True FRESH items, made BY those locals, I don't think that was half bad.  One other thing I like about P&P is that their prices are fixed & do not fluctuate as they see fit any given day like many other places of this type, and from what I could gather (didn't ask, so..) everything is always available - they even give you a \"menu\" when you check out.  This is especially handy if you're trying to plan for a special dinner or get-together.    True, you are gonna pay more than you would at the grocery store, and at times quite a bit more, but it really IS worth it (especially for many of the \"provisions\").  Once we've munched on the pastas & sauces I'll update this.  But as of this moment in time I'm drooling over my newfound love.  Everyone should visit P&P at least once, especially if you love to cook, play in the kitchen, or even just browse & get ideas for a simple meal for two since they're more they happy to help.  OH...and they have very reasonable hours, including Saturday AND Sunday!!!  See you there :)",

The staff was incredibly helpful and told us exactly how much pasta and sauce we needed. We had the garlic and rosemary linguini with their homemade pomodoro and marinara sauce (mix 1 part pomodoro, 2 parts marinara). It was incredible! We also had meatballs which I highly recommend. For $20, we fed 5 hungry runners! You only have to boil the fresh pasta for 60-90 seconds so it was really fast too.  They have these little chocolates on a shelf called \"liquid coffee\" for $.75 that I got on a whim-SO amazing and now I have to find out where else I could find them!",

Does it cost more to buy their made-in-house spaghettini or ravioli than HT's failed attempts? Of course.  But who cares. Everyone that works here is awesome, you can taste almost anything in the cold case before purchasing, open kitchen in the back so you can watch, if you tire of shopping...it's an impressive little store that deserves the extra buck or two. Or three. Hell, maybe even four.  Lately (for you meaters) they've branched out and have started stocking Grateful Grower's sausage and some other hard-to-find NC fine meats, as well as their standard Italian selection.  There's also a fridge with sauces, pastas, etc in the P/M Common Market, if you don't feel like making the drive down Providence, and the parking kinda sucks... but go at least once.

The service is spot on and friendly, the selection of imports very thorough, and from a quick already made meal to picking up components that you might be missing it's awesome.  Another secret of the store is they supply fresh pasta to a lot of the local restaurants.  The owners are also big Slow Food supporters and couldn't be nicer.",

I love it because although I enjoy cooking,ravioli is last on my list to whip up in the kitchen.

It's perfect for those weeks when you know are going to be killer and you're going to be exhausted...pick up a ready-to-eat meal and just pop it in the oven or grab some fresh pasta!  The staff were really helpful and friendly!   The only downfall was the cannoli. Now I know Nicole W. sang praises about this pastry, but I must have gone on a not fresh day. It was small, didn't taste fresh, and pricey for the size & quality. Perhaps my expectations are high since my only experience with cannoli's are from Little Italy in the Boston area where the cannoli's are so big they require two hands to eat them. This cannoli issue can be easily forgiven since the rest of the place was impressive!  Go, explore, and enjoy! Grazie, Pasta & Provisions!",

If I have more $, I'd stock my fridge and freezer full of their goods.  If nothing else, you HAVE to grab a bag of BUTTERNUT SQUASH RAVIOLI and and round of fresh FOCACCIA.  The bags of pasta are fresh made and then frozen, all you have to do is drop them in a pot of boiling water for 6-8 minutes and VOILA! you have a perfectly easy, delicious lunch or dinner with local, fresh, simple ingredients.   Let's get back to the bread. The rosemary focaccia that they have everyday is to die for and you can even buy half a round if you're not as carb crazy as I am. Just make sure you buy the focaccia the day you're going to eat it, because since it's not made with preservatives, it doesn't stay fresh for longer than a few days. Even then, when it's stale but still good, it makes a wonderful french toast.  IF they have it, make sure you try the focaccia with feta, sun dried tomatoes and olives. I'm salivating just thinking about it. It's really sharp and rich, but amazing. I wanna do a happy dance every time I take a bite.   Only complaint is that parking is crazy limited.",

All of which was amazingly tasty.    They have lots of different premade Italian food that your can purchase and take home with you.      Breads, cheeses, and meats all looked like a quality selection. I'll be back to try more of their selection.",

    "text": "I feel like we've barely scratched the surface at Pasta & Provisions, and can't wait to try more! Everything we've had from Pasta & Provisions has been perfect. The first time we went on a Friday to take advantage of the current meal deal where if you bring your own container you receive pomodoro or marinara sauce at a discounted per oz. price PLUS a free pound of pasta. We picked spaghetti and pomodoro sauce on this particular night. We couldn't resist picking up a few mini cannoli which were piped fresh right in front of us. The pasta was enough for 4 servings, and we got 32 oz of sauce, so that went a long way too. I think we ended up paying about $16 for the sauce, 6 frozen meatballs, 4 mini cannoli, and the pound of pasta. NOT BAD especially considering it was 4 servings! And, the speed at which the dinner came together once we were home made it even better.  The next time we visited we picked up frozen tortellini and the frozen pizza meal deal, which included a bag of salad and cannoli. We chose the Italian Cold Cut pizza, which was great. It's also worth mentioning that I'm not typically crazy about tortellini, but theirs was delicious.  We also typically park in the back, and more times than not get tired of waiting for a chance to turn left and just go right instead. It's all worth it though!",

I don't want anyone to know why when I make pasta it always tastes so much better then theirs.  That's right the secret is fresh pasta but who has the time to make it themselves these days.  I frequently stop by Pasta & Provisions to pick up all kinds of yummy stuff.  I love that I can get everything I need in one place for a great Italian meal and don't have to hassle with a large grocery store.  The garlic and parsley pasta is amazing.  They import a lot of food items I can't find anywhere else.  In fact they carry a sausage that I've never been able to find in twelve years of living in North Carolina.  Grab a loaf of their fresh baked bread and one of their homemade sauces and you have a great meal in no time.  You can also pickup a prepackaged meal like lasagna, chicken parmesan etc. & don't forget to check out the wine selection.  If you eat Italian food like I do then this is the place for you.  Besides the great food the staff  is incredibly friendly and helpful which  keeps me coming back for more!",

The staff is casual and friendly and always ready to make a recommendation.   This is the place I go when I really want to make a Christmas-present good sandwich. The breads are little beauties and they don't get upset when I ask for 5 slices of three different meats!

    "text": "Now that I've made a full Pasta and Provisions meal, I feel fully prepared to give an educated review.    Service: Rockin'. The little shop was packed (mostly with Myers Park-esque women who seemed to be staring at me, but I can ignore them) but there was always a friendly and knowledgeable staff ready to help.   I asked what I should make for dinner since I haven't tried their fresh pastas.  A mushroom one, and a garlic rosemary was recommended.  The person helping me said the linguine should only be boiled for 45 seconds.  She got me the right amount, and went to the back where the pasta is cut and prepared, to get the portion.  It's nifty to see the pasta come zipping into the cashier area on a wire, hung near the ceiling.   Foccacia (sp?) bread comes in an ENORMOUS wheel, almost the size of a large pizza of car wheel.  You can get it cut in half.  To go with it, I got a $2.50 bag of spring mix and a container of Greek (I know, it's Greek in an Italian store, but it's fantastic) white bean spread. The bread was light and fresh, the spread so savory and delicious...I ate half the container before dinner.  Oops!  There's a freezer section, a few of them full of frozen filled pastas like ravioli in different varieties (seafood, squash, mushroom, crab, cheese, etc.) and frozen sauces.  There are freshly refrigerated ones too, like the popular marinara and pomodoro sauces.  I chose the pomodoro with 12 meatballs.   I also got some peach soda for bellinis for a New Year's party, and some house cheese blend (parm and a couple other cheeses blended together in a plastic baggie), block of imported fontina cheese, and a small bottle of house dressing.   Everything was delicious.  The cooking directions of 45 seconds is spot on for al-dente pasta.  Compared to dried stuff, you'll never want to go back.  Just the right amount of chew and nice garlicky flavor.  The sauce too was super flavorful and blows the jarred Ragu stuff from the grocery store out of the water.    I forgot to pick up a canoli or one of the pie things at the front.  Oh well, next time.   PS: The prices are higher than the grocery store, but you really get what you pay for here.  Can't wait to plan out another meal here!",

When looking for fresh ravioli I was pointed to a freezer because, and get ready for this explanation, \"you have to freeze ravioli or it will fall apart\". That is the dumbest explanation I've ever heard. I guess, if you've never had pasta before you might think this is good.

Fresh pasta in all sorts of colors and favors - you pick the cut and how much you want.    Lots of frozen and prepared raviolis and lasagna etc.    Sauces of different kinds.   I love the sun dried tomato sauce on pasta and I always keep it on hand to use either as a nice spread on fresh baguettes or quick crostini appetizer base.     Plus all the extras you need from wine, oils, risotto, polenta, seasonings, tomato sauces and such.   Great specialty store.",

Located off of Providence (and a bit difficult to squeeze in and out of their faux parking lot) it's the neighborhood shop for all those seeking to attain the level of \"savant\" in preparing their pasta-laden meal(s).  First of all, the staff is so friendly it hurts. They genuinely are interested in what you are preparing. They aren't trying to shove a $200 wheel of Parmigiano into your shopping bag. They want to help you acquire the flavors that you're looking for and, without a doubt, they'll have what you're looking for. Have no idea what to prepare? They do. Ask one of the staff members for a recommendation and they'll hook you up with the starch, protein or mise en place to pull off a meal like Mario Batali in a super hero cape.   One of my favorite things about this place is the smell. Breath deeply, newbie shoppers. You'll breathe in the fresh garlic, herbs and fresh pasta being prepped in the back. What a treat and right in your Myers Park backyard.   I've ventured in on several occasions for dried pasta and other canned goods (pepperoncini peppers, olives, tomatoes, etc) but you can't beat their fresh pasta. They have over 10 different kinds in-house. My favorites are the garlic rosemary or the wild mushroom. Sampled a few of the others and they are all wonderful as well. All are ideal for preparing ravioli, lasagna, spaghetti or any other pasta dish you're looking to make.   This place is a market titan for its class. Wonderful selection, staff and overall presentation. Look forward to visiting every single time!",

We also got the pomodoro sauce and a pack of 6 frozen meatballs as well as a baguette. Everything was delicious. Best meatballs I've ever had, best baguette, best sauce. All of this you bring home and prepare yourself. It is more expensive than store bought but cheaper than a restaurant. We paid about $15 for everything.

Their chicken parmigiana is absolutely fantastic. All dishes come with easy instructions for heating at home and the pasta is so fresh it's ready in a pinch. Service is incredibly courteous and quick.",

I've had some of their pre-made stuff. The basil pesto is always a good pick, I added it to their pre-made 5 cheese ravioli. The chicken marsala was not so great last time I had it.

Picking out the flavor of pasta was a tough choice, but the little lightning bolts denoting a favorite flavor made it a bit easier.  The final choice was garlic & rosemary linguini.  I made a quick decision on the sauce and went with the pomodoro to try something different then my normal marinara.    I couldn't resist a baguette.  The pasta, sauce and bread totaled to around $8 - a great price for an amazing dinner.  The pasta was just as delicious as I was expecting, the sauce was fun with a little kick and the bread was gone quickly.    Glad I decided to expand my bubble and check out Pasta & Provisions.  I definitely will be returning.",

In the freezer is also Tiramisu and and Almond Cake which will make you break your New Years Resolution about eating sugar!. The Park Rd Location offers Sandwiches that are incredible..Ask for the Dominic! HE is my son who has a great palate and orders his Italian Sub with Everything and More!!

Whether you're getting a frozen pizza or a frozen pasta dish, you will not be disappointed with how it turns out when you cook it in your oven at home. The flavors are always spot on and it's so nice to have the dishes fresh from the oven in your own home.  I've ordered 20 mini cannolis ($1.50) from here for a birthday and they were fantastic -- the shell was fresh and crispy and they did a great job filling them. The cream is not too sweet but not too ricotta-y. Very well balanced. You can get them dipped in chocolate chip or pistachio.",

My guests could not get over how delicious the food is from here. From the moment I walked in the door, I was helped and the process so easy. The chicken parm was probably the dinner favorite. We also had a delicious spinach lasagna. I bought 3 containers of meatballs on my way out from the pickup thinking they'd be a nice add-on; not a single meatball was left! The cannolis were also a crowd pleaser.   The highlight and my major recommendation is the charcuterie. Brought them my own cutting board, told them how many people I had coming, and away they went with their talents. It is extremely affordable and looked spectacular.",

From the fresh cut deli meat, to the hand made and weighed pasta, to the ready-to-head entrees and wine selection, this place has it all.  As expected, you'll pay a premium here due to the quality of ingredients and the fact that you're in a more Ritzy neighborhood, but we think it's 100% worth it.   My favorite impulse buy is the small freshly filled cannoli. (You can also buy a larger one, but I love the small ones. Low guilt and high deliciousness factor.)  Looking for a date-night-at-home dinner? This is a great spot to stop for all or part of your meal.",

I ended up getting the stuffed shells meal and the lasagna.  Both had the directions to cook them.  The instructions were super easy to follow and the results were amazing!  I've tried a lot of Italian restaurants, but they had the absolute best stuffed shells and lasagna I have ever had!  I highly recommend coming to this place,  I can't wait to come back!

Stepped in and right away, I was greeted by 2 very friendly handsome men that work there. I'm thinking, oh wow. They may find a thick asian chick like me attractive. Hubba Hubba!!!!  Then another customer step into the store and they're just as friendly. Ok, wishful thinking on my part.  Looking around, I'm overwhelmed.. Thinking of Mario and many other famous Italian chefs who can possibly come here to get all their goodies. Fresh or frozen. Truly wish they have a location in Steele Creek. All their pastas can be easily custom cut. I wanted spinach lasagna and I asked them. They said yes they can cut it for me.. 5 mins later.. I'm holding a beautiful bag of green deliciousness! The staffs are friendly and they seem to know I'm lost and not a great cook. As they bagging my pasta. They provided with instructions.  I must say. I like to thank them for that.. Little did I know I don't have to cook them in advance because that's exactly what I was going to do! \"I'll be back!\" (In Arnold's voice)",

I'll have to come back next time I want some pre-made meals, they looks amazing!  I grabbed some fresh pasta made with rosemary and basil- about 5.50 enough for 4 large meals of pasta.

FOOD is what I miss. It's a nice little speciality store with a wonderful patio to dine out at. Me and my sons felt very comfortable to stay awhile. The menu selection was more limiting than I anticipated and asking for a few items seemed to be a unheard of.  (EX:chicken parm hero)I was told we don't have that!? I said you have chicken cutlets, mozzarella, sauce, and bread. All you do is assemble them together to make a sandwich. I've seen the pics online that it's been done before. The guy said ok it shouldn't be a problem. I received chopped up grilled chicken pieces in my sandwich with the other ingredients? It was good but not what I asked for or the taste I was looking for. We ordered a few different things including pasta. Which was very fresh tasting and the garlic bread was delicious. My sons enjoyed it. I'll try it again maybe order everything separate and assemble myself.",

It was a slow Sunday and I decided I was gonna go to the best cheese shop I could find and have a great cheese plate and great bottle of red wine for supper. The highest rated cheese shops weren't open. I went to several spots that didn't work out. I was close enough to P&P that I drove there to check things out after reading some damn good reviews.  Well once in there I decided to try something? My significant other was out of town so I was eating by myself.  I ended up not missing the cheese shops. I bought fresh pasta and pomodoro sauce and meatballs to check things out.  Keeping in mind that my SO is the best Italian chef I know. I tried the food Sunday and invited her over on Monday. She pronounced it as absolutely phenomenal just like I did. We are thinking that driving to  Charlotte from Mooresville for this quality of food is well worth the trip. Mario Battalli would pay these people to cook for him!!! Don't worry about driving from anywhere to get their food, it is worth it. I had a Pinot Noir instead of a Chianti with it and it was perfect. Meiomi was the Pinot.",

Go to the counter to find no fresh ravioli (all frozen) also all frozen Capavetti and Gnocchi.  All types of sauces are also frozen, except one. The kid at the counter is explaining to be how frozen ravioli is better.  Whatever.  The display had a sign for three types of Focacci,  I asked for 2 of the 3 no luck.   I bought the rosemary Focacci and it's sold warm and it's not bad.   I also decided to try a frozen Florantine ravioli and frozen Gnocchi.

    "text": "This place is like a little Italian grocery and a prepared foods shop.  They have the best fresh pasta (I love how it takes like 2 minutes to cook)- they have a bunch of different kinds of ravioli, spaghetti, and other classic Italian dishes.  If you want to try something a little different the sweet potato ravioli is awesome!  I also highly reccomend their sauces and breads.  This place also has a pretty decent wine selction.  This is the perfect to stop and pick-up something that you can prepare at home in minutes.",

    "text": "Pasta & Provisions is amazing!  You really should go there, now.  Right now.  Everything from the homemade pasta, ready to eat salads and grilled veggies, the sauces, the meatballs, the wine selection and the focaccia.  It's pretty hard not to get wrapped up into buying every item they sell.  It's all so fresh and local, it's like a dream!  And let me tell you a little something about the focaccia.  On a recent trip to Asheville my uncle asked if I could pick him up two rounds of focaccia.  He said, \"they just don't make focaccia like that up here.\"  You know it's good when you're taking out of town requests.  The entire entity is where it's at!  Owner, Tommy George has really created a family atmosphere in this authentic shop.  I always walk away, with a pep in my step, feeling great about supporting this local business and of course, hungry.  The pasta literally melts in your mouth and the meatballs are the best I've ever had.  This food is perfect for dinner parties, big family meals and/or a quiet date night at home.  And, of course it's good for you!  Eat Pasta Run Fasta!",
