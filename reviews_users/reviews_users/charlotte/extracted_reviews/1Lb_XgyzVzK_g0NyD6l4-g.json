The avocados weren't ripe and they forgot our seaweed salad inside the bowl, but it was still good. We also got the Kamikaze Kimchi Fries to share and it was really good. It was a bit salty for my taste but that's just me being picky. The price is a bit high to be honest but expected for how good the food tastes. I'd definitely come back again!",

The cooks are the same NASTY cooks from the previous restaurant called Shiki.  These are the same cooks you see sitting on buckets and the sidewalk at the back door of the restaurant.  I told the cashier that the cook was digging in his nose, and it wasn't just a simple wipe of the nose, he was digging hard and for about 20 seconds.  Although they've remodeled and the name has changed, there are still old disgusting habits since they're using the same cooks from Shiki. Never eating there again!!!",

It came with a big bone of beef rib that was oh so soft and tender. Broth was delicious. I also had the Kim chi fries which are highly addictive. Crispy waffle fries topped with beef and Kim chi. Definitely different than what I'm used to but it was amazing. Highly recommended. I'll be back for sure to try some of the other dishes that they have!!!",

We go three on a plate with generous portions of beef, cilantro, carrots and green onions and a spicy mayo sauce. Next was the poke bowl that may have been one of the best bowls I have had in Charlotte. It was loaded with rice, avocado, pineapple, masago, and of coarse tuna and some delicious sweet sauce. Then there was the massive bowl of pho. The broth was pristine clear and savory with beef and vietnamese aromatics. There was a very generous portion of beed. This has to be one of the best meals I have had in a while and will soon be a regular.",

They took it back and we're sitting here waiting for him to get his food while ours gets cold. The mixup is not a big deal and still would have resulted in 5 stars. This place is getting one star because it's been 39 minutes since my son returned his order, my food is cold, everyone in line has been served, the portions are small and we ended up walking out without his food and returning my plate. While this was a one star upon us waking out the door we brought it to their attention and the owners apologized, recooked our plates, refunded the 2 uneaten meals and remade them fresh! It is service like this that makes you feel valued! Great finish to a rough start.",

Now that it's apparently been rated one of the best Asian restaurants in Charlotte (really???) I'm comfortable putting in my 2 cents.  The prices are reasonable, the presentation is excellent for a casual restaurant and service is super, that why I rated it 3 stars  The food, on the other hand, is not bad but it's bland, boring, meh.  We had the \"signature\" poke bowl and as much as I appreciate its price being a couple or three dollars lower than at better poke eateries it still was not good enough that I'd order it ever again. The Kamikaze Kim Chi fries were fast food kind of terrible and the Vietnamese street tacos with shrimp were OK, but there's a lot better all over town these days.  Overall 2 stars for the food, raised to 3 because of price and presentation.",

Enough to share for 2-3 people. It is a little on the double digit side of cost, but the price is worth the quality of the ingredients. I'm so thankful they opened it up close to home. Staff is awesome and friendly. Will definitely be back and have already told friends about it. It is across from the Walmart in the Galleria shopping center.   I had the Kimchi fries and the vietnamese shrimp tacos. Next time, I would ask for the sauce to be put on the side, since the sauce kind of soaked into the tortilla. Other than that, great experience all around.",

I just wish there were more flavor options for them. The rice bowl was very good, very hearty I just wish I had a little more meat and a little less rice. I give this place 4 stars because the food was great, service was also really good and the interior was gorgeous. I hope that they can expand a bit more in their drink options as well since they only serve foundation drinks and water currently.",

Same guy was running the place so I figured same quality of food. And I think I'm right, because the food is alright. I've had Vietnamese Tacos, the Beef Bulgogi Bowl, the Signature Poke Bowl, the brisket Pho. I've also sampled the hibachi chicken and tuna nachos. I will give a quick review now if each meal: Out of all these meals, the Vietnamese tacos are undoubtedly the best thing I've had. I'm a big fan of banh mi, and those tacos were on point. The Bulgogi bowl is alright, not a huge fan of the kimchi that comes with it. The hibachi chicken is ok, nothing crazy about it. The pho definitely lives up to the hype, very delicious. The poke is good, nothing special about it. And finally, the tuna nachos are a strange concept, essentially sushi nachos, but taste good. My goal is to try everything, so far, they haven't disappointed.",

    "text": "Yelp recommended this place and I am so glad it did! I had the pho with chicken and it was so good. My first time having pho and was very impressed with the broth and additions that came with it. I added the lime and jalapeno, but passed on the tai basil since I don't like licorice. The bowl was huge and filled to the rim. It was triple the size I could eat myself but my husband didn't mind helping! He thought he didn't like rice noodles until he tried these and he was very impressed. My husband ordered a plate with teriyaki steak, mixed veggies, sweet carrots, and fried rice. The pieces of steak were tender and the rice had good actual flavor, unlike other restaurants rice that can be a bland afterthought. We also ordered the crab wontons, which came with a sweet and spicy sauce. They came out very hot, but were very tasty. The service was very friendly, answered all my questions, and the kitchen was fast. Everything came out looking like a magazine photo with beautiful presentation. The portions were very adequate for the price. The atmosphere is wonderful and staff keeps it very clean and tidy. I will definitely be including this place in our regular restaurant cycle.",

Their Kamikaze Filet Kimchi Fries are definitely a must to try when you go there, super crispy and flavorful while being aesthetically pleasing. Also the Poke Bowls are very filling and worth the price, highly recommend checking this place out for your Asian food cravings!",

I did add a little soy because I like a little more bold flavor but it was still good before I added it. It came with a soup and a salad. The soup was your standard soup with onion and the salad was just lettuce with ranch. I was expecting at least some carrot or something else but the main course more than made up for it as it was a large portion and tasted really good. It isn't busy right now (330 pm) and the food was on the table within 5 minutes and everything was done and hot so you know it was freshly made.  Definitely coming back soon!   Also I do like the atmosphere here. The greenery although it is fake it still looks good in this modern style location.",

We went all out and got a whole spread: chicken fried rice plate, pork fried rice plate, king salmon bowl, be-em's spring rolls, be-em's famous savory soy wings, and coconut. The wings were crispy and meaty, and the flavoring was a sweet soy glaze that was a new flavor. I've had soy wings at KFC (Korean fried chicken) places typically but it's never been sweet before, so this was a great rendition of that.  The egg rolls were c r u n c h city and filled with chicken and veggies! The outside wasn't oily (thank you so much because I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to oil ) . The Thai chili sauce was a great compliment to the filling but I honestly didn't need any sauce on mine. My king salmon poke bowl was filled with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes were fantastic. I loved everything about except for the spicy mayo sauce. I just felt that there was a bit too much spicy mayo but I'm not a huge fan of mayonnaise in general.  The chicken and pork entrees were large in size as well. The dish Is like a hibachi grill but not as greasy in my opinion.  Highly recommend this place",

Go to the counter, order your food, and they bring it to your table.  The servings are huge.  I had a tofu plate with brown rice and vegetables. I ordered the grilled tofu, but they brought me the fried tofu. It was an error, but I didn't send it back. Deanna had the pho with chicken.  There were so many noodles in her bowl that she could have shared it with everyone living in South Charlotte.  I was actually going to order the pho, but it came with only beef broth.  The lady behind the counter promised me that they would soon have other broth options.  This was a fun spot that is getting a lot of good Yelp attention.  Thankfully, Yelp continues to guide me in the right direction!",

They were hot. But tasted greasy inside. I made the front counter staff aware and they we're making the kitchen staff aware. No one bothered to come out front to speak to me about it. Wonderful customer service huh? Oh well. I'm just glad there are other places around to order from. The two stars is for the food Portion only.",

Not sure if this place is same owners but it is a significant upgrade. So pretty inside and love the branding. You order at the counter and then they give you a number and will bring your food to the table. This is a Asian restaurant which has Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean dishes. They also have poke bowls. Truly something for everyone.     I ordered the chicken and steak hibachi entree. My husband had the Korean bbq beef bowl. My entree came with soup and salad and the bowl had fried rice, brocolli and zucchini, sweet carrots and chicken/shrimp. It was a very large portion. I really enjoyed it - it was delicious. The Korean bbq beef bowl was also very good. We really like Korean bbq flavors. I think it is going to be one of the most popular dishes here.     Other menu highlights include Koji karaage chicken which is a fried popcorn chicken with sweet chili sauce- I want to try this next time! Also the street tacos sound great!   The staff were all super friendly and helpful. I will absolutely be back soon!!",

We ordered the spring rolls, kamikaze filet kimchi waffle fries, teriyaki chicken and rice, Vietnamese beef street tacos, and a Korean BBQ beef poke bowl. I also had the passion fruit tea. Every single thing was superb. The kamikaze filet kimchi fries were my absolute favorite. The manager came out to greet us, and told us to order what we wanted and she would take care of it. The staff brought out all of our food and was really accommodating. They checked on us throughout the meal to ensure we didn't go without anything we needed. Being that the restaurant is so close to me I will definitely be back in to dine.",

    "text": "So after being opened for 3 months, I finally decided to go give this place a try since they added drinks to their menu. I ordered the oxtail pho, Korean beef bowl, kamikaze fries, Thai tea with grass jelly & my fave the fresh coconut.   Rating for the food: the pho broth was phenomenal. So clean, simple and fresh! First time I had pho that I didn't have to add any extra sauce or ingredients to it. Just wow! Buuuuut, even though the broth was so good unfortunately the noodles were over cooked. Korean beef bowl was a little sweet for me but the kimchi was awesome! Kamikaze fries: the fries were cold and tasted old but I bet if it came out hot, it would have tasted even better. Now for the drinks, I'm a self proclaimed Thai Tea connoisseur. Lol. I love Thai tea, it's one of my go to drinks when I'm at an Asian restaurant. The Thai tea was good and the grass jelly also tasted fresh made. Lastly, for the one thing that made me drive 30mins out for, the fresh coconut drink. The drink itself was so refreshing and getting to eat the coconut meat after finishing the drink made it even better. Only thing that upset me the most about the coconut drink is that it didn't come out with the restaurant logo stamp on it. Like really people! Presentation is everything! I asked the server why mines didn't come out with a stamp and she just gave me a shoulder shrug and replied \"I don't know\". Um, okay.   As for customer service, ugh! Absolutely horrible. The girl in the front taking my order had absolutely and I mean absolutely no knowledge of the menu. I had asked for a few recommendations of what to get and she also said, \"I don't know\". Um okay. I then proceeded to ask which pho had the bone in, her answer \"Oh, I don't know\". I mean, if you don't know the answer you can easily go to the back and ask. After that, I was just ready to place whatever order and just get my food. Nothing ruins a place more than having sucky service with a worker who doesn't have any knowledge about the menu.  As for the inside, it was modern and clean. They are quick to clean a table after the customer leaves.  I'll definitely be giving this place a second chance because the pho broth was so good, but customer service needs improvement.",

My wife and I both had the Chicken and Shrimp Combo meal, which was piled high, piping hot and delicious! At $13, it also came with a side salad with savory ginger dressing AND soup.  Presentation was beautifully done and the service was very friendly and cheerful. Sanitation score was 95.  I really enjoyed the unique small touches such as the IKEA serving boards on which our meal was delivered, the whimsical ivy covered wall and even their classy carry out boxes.  For me, except for being a bit pricey, they checked all the boxes. Even when it comes to price, however, they provide exceptional value considering their serving sizes. We intend to be back.",

However they no longer have table service and the menu had almost completely changed the first time we tried it we were not overly impressed. I keep up with restaurants in our area to see what's good and I saw the 5 star reviews from Be Em and decided to try it again today and I am so happy I did! I got the steak and chicken with noodles, it also comes with salad and soup it was delectable. They bring everything to your table and the staff are really friendly. My niece got Steak and shrimp and she are every bite. They also have Pho, Poke and at least 10 different kinds of fruit and bubble teas. I recommend you go get your BE EM on immediately.",

The reviews on here looked awesome and the food presentation is A1. I asked my bf if we should try it out and he was down. My bf got the Korean bbq bowl and I opted for the kamalazie kimchi fries. I wanted the Korean bbq bowl too but since this was our first time trying this place, I thought we could share meals.  I'm glad I got the fries because they are really good!! My only concern was that I wish it was a better helping like in the dine in pics.. However, as you can see it was enough for one person. I smashed it. The sauces are so good and using waffle fries is the best for this dish. Also, the food wasn't hot. My bf even said his bowl was lukewarm  My bf's bowl was really good. The bulgogi is so flavorful. Kimchi and egg. Perfection. I can't wait to try more from their menu. Looking for a good Korean fix? Try this place out!!",

I am a firm believer that if I'm going to drive somewhere simply for food and it's not convenient to what I have going on that day let the food be worth driving for.....I must say Be-Em definitely exceeded my expectations. The creative concept of the restaurant when you walk in is breath taking for it to be so limited in space. I remember the restaurant that was in this location before them and boy am I glad how things have changed. I ordered the veggie dumplings, scallop plate with mixed veggies and fried rice, and the strawberry blitz refresher as a recommended compliment to my meal. They are very quick and the system behind how you order and delivery of your food works for them! So I have no complaints about service. The food was very fresh and full of flavor and the refresher was sooooo good I had no need for dessert. The only reason I took one start away is because for a new timer some things were a little confusing. I needed little things like side dishes or extra napkins and didn't know if I had to walk up or some one would serve us and at the end of the meal I didn't want to be rude but didn't know if I left my plates on the table or they had a trash area for me to clean the tray myself something that could fixed with a sign maybe? Overall, I would and already have recommended this place to others and am glad it is here for the foodies",

With each visit, I ordered something different to get a variety of taste. The quality and freshness of the food, amiable environment and staff, and service as you walk into the doors... A+. My experience was great each time; there is plenty of seating indoors and outside and the decoration is beautiful.   The items that I have with images:  Crunchy California Bowl: my second time ordering this!! It is perfect for someone who isn't a raw sushi fan. There's crab meat, avocado, spicy crab, cucumber and tempura crunch topped with eel sauce (my favorite!) For the price of this, it is definitely worth it due to the freshness of each topping of this poke bowl.  Crispy wonton bites: basically cheese wontons or crab rangoons.. however, you would like to call it!   Korean BBQ Beef Bowl: Beef, fried egg, kimchi! and you can see... I got the wontons again (no regrets)   Koji Karaage Chicken: IDK how to pronounce this BUT THIS WAS SO GOOD. Whatever they did to this... I want the recipe.   NEW BOBA/TEA/DRINKS!!!! Honestly, would come back for the drinks.  Lychee Love: refreshing with fruits!  Oreo Cookies and Cream: with roasted oolong tea... yummy omg. I felt like a little kid using my spoon and trying to grab all of the oreos out of the cup.  and Cafe Sua Da, Vietnamese coffee with sea salt cream !   Overall experience: I would definitely come back for the koji chicken, poke bowls and their drinks. I'm impressed with the presentation, the tray, and the amount of food they give for each dish. It was definitely, definitely worth it.",

    "text": "A recent favorite find and I've been addicted ever since! I'm usually not a huge fan of Asian fusion restaurants as it's often difficult to retain quality (in my opinion). I've tried a bit of everything and I have to say Be Em does a good job of marrying different flavors, textures and cuisines.  Favorites: Kimchi Fries: bulgogi, kimchi, sriracha, cheese, magic?, etc on a bed of WAFFLE FRIES. I would live on this   Ahi Tuna Nachos: the tuna was incredibly fresh and the flavors delish! In fact, they were sold out last time I went so I assume this is a general favorite   Good: Teriyaki: I've tried the teriyaki steak with scallops. Good portion and flavor.   Poke Bowl: I tried the salmon one. I thought the flavor was great along with the size of the bowl, but wish there were more salmon pieces. This was mom's favorite :)  Wouldn't Recommend: Wings: I got the savory soy and the flavor just seemed off. The soy sauce was thicken to almost a bitter taste while the wings seem a bit dry  Match Milk Tea: while this was decent, definitely not the usual milk tea quality I'm used to. I know they recently added all of their teas so hopefully it'll improve in the near future   Would love to come back and try the pho next time!",

It was so pretty inside that we chose to sit inside. I really loved the details of light fixtures.   We walked up to the counter and ordered the Vietnamese Street Tacos- steak, Be-Em's famous wings- Thai sweet chili and I had the Bulgogi bowl. I couldn't decide on what to drink so I had two!! The fresh coconut and the lychee love (thinking I would take the Lychee Love to-go). The coconut was fresh with plenty of coconut water and the lychee love was extremely refreshing that I drank it all during dinner!   I really loved the street tacos, if you love eating Banh Mi then it is the same fun flavors but in a taco form. The Chicken wings were so crispy and I really love crispy wings. The bulgogi bowl was a great portion and I definitely am excited to eat the leftover for lunch today. We were thinking that their small plates were going to be like restaurants in uptown where they barely give you any food. But it was a pleasant surprise that the small plate portions were so big.",

Walking in, you can't help but notice their \"earthy\" interior.  They even have parts of the wall covered in moss.  Pretty cool and definitely fits the style of being organic and environmentally friendly.    I went with the Be-Em Signature Poke Bowl and it was delicious!  The portion was more than enough for lunch, so I found myself eating the rest for dinner that night.  I was debating whether or not to order their tiramisu dessert drink because I'm sure it's full of calories but I figured this could be my cheat meal for the week.  I definitely don't regret that decision!   Overall, this place is a great spot if you're craving some Asian food.  They've got a lot of variety so you don't have to limit yourself to a specific cuisine. The presentation of the food and the decor of the restaurant is definitely a foodie's Instagram paradise.  I also love their mission of being organic, ecofriendly, and giving back to the community.",

The decor and ambiance in the restaurant were great. I really enjoyed just being in the space with all the greenery and openness. They have a really great variety of menu items with everything from bubble/milk teas to traditional Asian entrees. We tried quite a few things! A few of my favorites were the Korean BBQ bowl, the kimchi fries, and their wings were great! The staff is also super cool and super patient. They can make great recommendations on things to try if you want. All in all, this will be one of my go to places to get my Asian food!",

    "text": "So I finally made my way to Be Em Asian Kitchen after talking about going for awhile amongst co-workers. This place is awesome! It's easy to find with a WalMart being close by too.  This place isn't your typical Asian restaurant though. It's a fast-casual place. You order at the counter then they give you a number then bring the food out to you when the food is ready. Definitely a plus for me since most Asian restaurants take their sweet time bringing the check when you're ready to leave. (hate waiting)  The interior is really nice! Love the moss on the walls. The employees were very helpful in helping me choose what I wanted to order. I got the tuna nachos. They were amazing. Crispy chips with the freshness of the tuna and whatever sauce they drizzled on top, damn it was good. I also got the filet and shrimp kabob entree. It's basically hibachi but I've never had a filet and shrimp kabob with hibachi so I ordered it. It was delicious and was such a huge portion. It even came with a side of soup! The filet and shrimp was cooked perfectly. So good that when I reheated my leftovers, it was still had that melt in your mouth feeling.   And the PassionFruit drink! I'm typically not a fruit drink type of person but decided to get it since I was in a splurge type moment. Boy, I was not disappointed. Not overly sweet but super refreshing. It definitely gave me some life at the end of a long work day.  What a perfect place for me to come during my lunch break during the week. Going to have to try and bring my coworkers now.",

    "text": "Always wanted to try this because I kept seeing popping up on Facebook and Instagram as my some of my friends had been there! Very talked about and it was always in the back of my head.  Anyways, we came during lunch!  When you first walk in, very beautiful opened space and love, love the extreme vaulted ceilings. The decorations were very simple, but I absolute love the green to it.  At first I thought it was a \"please wait to be seated\" kind of thing but it wasn't so don't stand at the door looking silly waiting for someone to come seat you. You order and pay at the counter and will bring you food.  My husband and I (plus 4 little children) ordered pan fried dumplings, crispy wonton bites, firecracker bites, be em's dac biet, be em's signature poke bowl, Korean bbq beef bowl and chicken & shrimp teriyaki plate!  Pan Fried Dumpling: Crispy and juicy! Loved everything about it. The sauce was perfect and every bite was delicious.  Crispy Wonton Bites: it was crispy as mentioned, but dripping with oil. I mean, it didn't really bother me, but it was kind of messy. Came with sweet chili sauce, but it's already delicious without it.  Firecracker Bites: I was extremely disappointed on this appetizer. It was soggy and didn't have a lot of sauce to cover it. I was not a fan.   Be Em's Dac Biet Pho: Okay, I'm always hesitant to try pho, but my niece said it was better than my favorite pho back here at my city so we HAD to try it. The broth was very, very similar to my favorite pho joint. I could honestly drink the broth itself. So if the broth is good, the pho should be good too and it was. My kids enjoyed it so much!! But my husband said he should had gotten the oxtail one instead. It might had been even better.   Be Em's Signature Poke Bowl: This bowl is actually really delicious. But I think it would had been better if the bowl was a little bit bigger and had more sauce. It was a little hard to mix it all, but it was good.   Korean BBQ Beef Bowl: This now is on point. I really like that sweet red sauce they had in it. The egg was cooked to perfection and once mixed, my taste bud just explodes with many delicious sauce.   Chicken & Shrimp Teriyaki with Rice: Everything on this plate was super good. Usually I don't do teriyaki, but I had to try it because my kids said it was good and usually they don't say such thing and it was yummy. I think if they cut the chicken pieces a bit smaller, it would had been more eatable! Haha, other than that, it was super good.  Overall, this place is bomb. I would come back if I am around the area. Not yet try their teas so I will def come back for that.",

We ordered a plethora of Small-Bites and apps dishes to try out. All dishes were made to order with fresh, local/organic ingredients; I love that there are substitutions available depending on your dietary needs and restrictions. Favorites were: Pan Fried Dumplings, Crispy Wonton Bites, Be Em's Famous Wings, Kamikaze Filet Kimchi Fries, Sesame Ahi Tuna Nachos, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and Vietnamese Street Tacos. Portion sizes are massive and perfect for groups.   Also, their Cafe Sua Da and fruit teas are delightful. Refreshing on an extremely hot, summer day. You can't go wrong with any of the menu items, even the kiddos enjoyed it!",

    "text": "My coworker told me about this place and how I needed to try it. But I looked it up and it was a bit of a hike from where I live. Then a week later, I passed this trying to kill time before my orthodontist appointment and realized it's not that far of a drive. Finally made it out and it's definitely worth the drive!  We walked in and were surprised how nice it is inside. Most Asian restaurants (the authentic ones at least) aren't really decorated so modern or at all. We took a look at the menu and they have a variety of options, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese, and Hawaiian. Normally restaurants aren't good at all, but from what we tried (street tacos, pho, poke, boba tea) they can definitely excel in all.   We ordered a small plate thinking it would be small portions. Yet again, we were wrong. Good size portion that left us full but wanting to eat more because it was so yummy. The food came out super fast for a fast casual restaurant. The Vietnamese Street taco with steak was delish and very reasonably priced. The pho tai with short rib and filet strips is hands down the best pho I've had in Charlotte (and I've been on the hunt for 4 years). The short rib, which was still on the bone for maximum flavor, was so tender and juicy! I didn't think it could get much better, but then I tried my fiancee's Hawaiian poke bowl (sub salmon for spicy tuna) and we were in food coma heaven. He said it was the best poke he's had in Charlotte too! The lychee boba tea was the perfect ending to wake us up! And to top it off, the tea was cold with no ice for max beverage!  The one thing a restaurant should invest in is quality meats, and Be-Em did just that. They have such a huge selection of meats too. We will definitely be back every time we're in the mood for anything Asian (which is quite often)!",

    "text": "If you live in the Charlotte area anywhere outside of South End/Elizabeth/Dilworth/Plaza Midwood, you're likely tired of everyone you know that does live in those areas touting them as if they're the center of Charlotte culture and nothing exists outside of those areas.    Be-Em is the perfect answer to those charges.  With a trendy, \"South End\" type of poke-Korean appeal in an admittedly non-\"hip\" location (this place could easily be on South Blvd rather than off of Sardis, but I'm not complaining), Be-Em really is something special compared to the surrounding area.  Our group ordered:  -Korean BBQ Beef Bowl: This is by far the best thing on the menu.  The beef is moist, flavorful and absolutely delicious.  Served with a fried egg, kimchi, rice, amongst other things, this bowl is a meal on its own and is probably going to be my go to when I go back in the future.  -Pan fried dumplings: The best starter/\"small plate\" on our order.  The dumplings are fresh, piping-hot and the sauce was delicious.  Definitely a must-try.  -Crispy wonton bites: Also another good starter, but in a pinch/if I weren't just trying to sample a bunch of things on the menu, I'd probably go for the pan-fried dumplings.  -Crunchy california bowl: We weren't a fan of the crunchy california bowl as much.  While it was okay for a poke-bowl, it is definitely overshadowed by the Korean BBQ Beef Bowl.  -Vietnamese street tacos: Pretty average for small-plate tacos.  Probably not something we'd order again.  -Chicken and shrimp (teriyaki): Again, pretty much average chicken and shrimp teriyaki.  Not this place's specialty, nor does it claim to be, and you can do better on other places of the menu.  Overall, a really good experience and I'm so glad that a trendy, delicious restaurant has finally opened somewhere convenient to those of us that don't live within a mile of uptown.",

I also tried their signature Fresh Coconut drink served in a cool, rustic shell...and as expected, it was Dee-Lish! Since I'm CooCoo over Coconuts anyway, I would have loved it every which way. I only wish there was more of it inside the shell.  Like I said last time, I really like the modern, eco-friendly decor here...and I love the super-comfy booths. The place is quite spacious as well, with a cool, relaxing vibe! I only wish they had overhead music (something lively, something Asian, or maybe New Age to match its eco-friendly style?) would add some spark to the place. Just a suggestion!  If this restaurant wasn't so far from my home, I can easily see myself hanging out regularly.   Anyway, if you haven't been, you're missing out. Check it out...and soon!",

Be-em Asian Kitchen is a True Asian fusion restaurant with Japanese, Vietnamese and Korean influences!  The restaurant's decor was very nice and modern. The staff was very welcoming and helpful with menu suggestions. The manager Dee (Bear) was very polite and made sure we felt at home.   Ok on to the food! My friend and I had the following:   * Be-em spring rolls -crispy outside but flavor wise just ok. * Kamikaze filet Kim chi fries -OMG! The BEST thing on the menu by far! Must try!  * Korean bbq beef bowl -yummy and flavorful. Love the sesame flavor paired with the Korean bbq and kimchi  * Vietnamese street tacos (steak) -soo savory and yummy! Has a little kick, if you don't prefer spicy, omit the fresh jalapeno.  * Chicken teriyaki  -chicken, zucchini, broccoli. Teriyaki sauce was on the sweeter side. * Mango crush & passionfruit fresh fruit teas -LOVED these fresh made drinks. My favorite was the mango crush which had jelly pieces and chia seeds, yum!  I will DEFINITELY be returning soon as this is a new favorite!",

There's plenty of tables and seating. They also have a few tables outside.   You order at the counter - the menu is huge!! It used to be a hibachi spot and the hibachi really blew me away! The shrimp I had had amazing flavor and was great quality.   I also tried the poke bowls- they are huge and delicious! Tons of fresh fish and toppings.   They have Asian inspired tacos- I loved the seared tofu. Perfect for vegetarians and great flavor and texture. Would be fun to share as an app too (comes with 3 tacos)  You MUST get the coconut !! They cut open a fresh coconut for you to drink the coconut water out of. It was such a special experience and so unique! I felt like I was in the islands.   The tuna wonton nachos were a delicious app. Great for sharing and covered in tons of tuna, avocado, seaweed salad and sauces.   They firecracker shrimp were delicious tempura style. They were pretty spicy!  Overall I had a great experience. They staff are so sweet and welcoming. They helped me decide and explained the menu for me.",

I've been here 3 times since then and everything has been really good.  It has a quick service feel so when you walk in you go to the counter to order. They do have menus setup by the front door as you walk in. The decor is really nice and they have plenty of seating. They have a pretty big menu from small bites, soups and salads, hibachi, pho, and poke bowls.  My two favorite things right now are the kamikaze filet Kim chi fries and the sesame ahi tuna nachos! Both are sooooo delicious and full of flavor!  Also got starters, the pan fried dumplings are good but didn't like the crispy wonton bites they were blah, ate one didn't want the rest.

I have a broken leg and came in with crutches, and the nice girl at the counter actually told me to sit down and she would come take my order. That's amazing service. I ordered hibachi chicken and shrimp and my friend ordered the pho. Also ordered the wings and a thai iced tea with coffee jelly. Thai tea was great, strong tea flavor without being overtly sweet. Chicken wings with thai chili sauce was fried very well. Nice and crisp. The hibachi chicken and shrimp came with a salad and soup, the portion was humongous. The pho was also a good portion size. Overall a great little restaurant and I'd highly recommend it.",

I recall an image featuring their signature logo on these wooden boards that they serve food on.   Walked in and my first impression was wow! The decor was so beautiful and seemed way out of the league compared to the surrounding areas' restaurants.   I did not expect the restaurant to be fast casual from the initial marketing, but I did rather enjoy the idea of paying prior to eating so that I could get on with my night and not wait for a server.   I ordered the wings, shrimp appetizer and Korean BBQ beef bowl. The shrimp was 10/10, wings 7/10 and beef bowl 7/10. I would score the beef bowl higher but I felt like I needed just a tad bit more flavor or sauce in it.   Overall, i had a nice experience. It's a large restaurant and a great place to grab food with friends. Think chipotle meets glamour!",

    "text": "This place had been showing up on Yelp recently with a lot of good reviews. We decided to take our Monday off and make the drive out to Matthews to check it out.   We went with a group of people so we got a bunch of small plates and shared everything. It's fast casual so you order, take a number, find a seat, and they bring your food to you. The food came out very quickly.  We tried: veggie spring rolls, crispy wonton bites, Thai sweet chili wings, kamikaze filet kimchi fries, sesame ahi tuna nachos, firecracker shrimp, Koji karaage chicken, shrimp Vietnamese street tacos, a custom hibachi plate, and the Korean BBQ beef bowl.  Everything was great. I think my absolute favorite was the Korean BBQ beef bowl. It's under the poke bowl section on the menu which is misleading because it's really more of bibimbap. Some other favorites were the wings (very crispy), the tacos, the firecracker shrimp, the nachos, and the fries.   The couple of things I wasn't a huge fan of were the Koji Karaage Chicken (really needed sauce) and the hibachi (wasn't bad, just didn't compare to how good the other dishes were). Both of these were still good, they just didn't stand out.   I would highly recommend checking this place out if you like Asian food!",

It's cool to see a restaurant bring life to the space by incorporating just plants.   We got two entree's (one came with soup and salad) and an order of spring rolls. The only thing I could have done with out were the spring rolls, mainly because i didn't notice they were fried. Everything else was great. I'll be going back for poke and more noodles- you can never have enough soba noodles In your life.",

We are there shortly after it re-opened and it took forever.  We then decided to do take out only.  The first take out order was wrong.   We were missing our soup and they quickly replaced it but then once home we realized there was no shrimp sauce.  Our most recent visit was sub-par.  While the order were correct, the food was terrible.  Our onion soup had a foul taste.  So much so that we refused to eat it.  I ordered a chicken plate with mixed veggies and it seemed well cooked but flavorless.  We knew immediately after eating that something wasn't cooked well.  The next day I was sick the entire day and 2 days after eating it, still am.  It's quite disappointing as this has been a go to place for years prior to remodeling/rebranding.  Sad to say, we won't be returning.",

I was shocked !!! Everyone knows the broth is piping hot when they pour it over raw meat and  sense the meat is so thin it cooks very fast well by the time I got home my broth was warm not nearly enough to cook the meat , I honestly think this is some sorta food violations code to even do something like that",

First of all I'm not fond of restaurants where you order in a line like you're at a fast food restaurant, I like to sit down and leisurely decide what I'd like to order. Ignoring the mechanics of the ordering process I ordered the shrimp plate with rice, mixed vegetables and hibachi sauce and was very disappointed in the quality of the food. The food was flavorless, the rice was cold and the carrots were so bland and mushy that I suspect they were served straight out of a can. I definitely won't be visiting Be-Em again.",

Everything was spot on! Kinda weird placing the order at the counter and then sitting down, but whatever works! Clean, food was awesome, and prices were good.

    "text": "Formerly Shiki, this restaurant has gone through a significant upgrade from what it was previously. I asked and was told the daughter of the previous owner is now in charge and she did a great job giving the place a fresh new look. The interior has nice green plants and love the wood interior. This restaurant is a welcome addition to the area: you can get poke bowls, pho, and other Asian fusion dishes. The best dish we had were the kimchi fries. Don't be fooled by the \"small bites\" menu- the portions are HUGe! A better name could be Starters. The waffle fries were nice and crispy and topped with delicious marinated beef, kimchi, cheese and cilantro. I also got the Ahi Poke bowl and it was decent- not the best I've had. One suggestion is that the poke bowls need a sauce to tie it all together. We also ordered the wings and they were decent- they were cooked well but too mild in flavor for my liking. They aren't korean fried wings, just small lightly fried wings. Overall very impressed with the change and will definitely be back!",

Today, I ordered the chicken hibachi with fried rice and vegetables and it was so delicious. Each component was super flavorful and fresh and I couldn't have asked for anything more. Not to mention, the atmosphere is super cute and modern. Loved it and totally recommend! I hope to come back soon and try some of their other dishes out!!",

The noodles were a bit over cooked for my taste.  The ginger salad was good.  If you don't like a ton of dressing, ask them to put it in the side.  They really pile it on.  Only disappointment was the onion soup.  A bit sweet.  Will return for sure.",

The food is very fresh and served in a very beautiful way where you finish the creation, with soups at least, by adding the fresh veggies served next to your noodle bowl.  This means the flavors of the soup were not all mushed together but tasted separate and unique in the bowl, a really great way to enjoy your meal.  The meats were cooked just right, neither over or under done.  Great background music that wasn't too loud, which added to the great experience.  Lastly, the staff visited us while we ate, not just to ask the obligatory \"how is everything\" but also to make a recommendation on what to try next time.  Most helpful.  Overall, a great and recommended eating experience!",
