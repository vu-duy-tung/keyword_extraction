    "text": "Saturday 5pm. Place filled quickly around 5:30. Patio looked inviting, just a bit warm out for our taste. Maybe after the sun was down. No reservations for under 8ppl, call ahead seating 30min to get on the list.   Glad I went with a group! We tried (almost) EVERYTHING!Not really, the menu is HUGE! Fried pickles, das pretzels, nachos, onion rings, honey/hot buffalo wings to get started. Everything  fried was clean, lightly battered & crisp.  Pretzels- warm, salty & chewy awesomeness. Pickles- spears not chips. Not overly battered so you actually taste the cuc. Tart and crisp. Good but, not necessary, dipping sauce.  Nachos- not the dry on bottom type. These chips were well dressed and ready to party. Chicken, cheese, beans, peppers, tomatoes, in every bite. No digging around.  Wings-half buffalo hot and half honey hot (good, sticky & spicy)- dry seasoned, good heat and crisp. Did not miss that (oh so good) saucy mess.   Kids had hot dogs. All beef classic. Good selections for kids, with fruit options (!), not just hotdog and chicken fingers.  Two elbows off the table (and they were)- deffinatly take this for a spin. Triple meat (beef, salami and more awesome thin sliced beef), provolone, chipotle mayo, savory, sweet salty in one pretzel bun'd bite.   Texas Brisket- yes, each time, yes. Cooked to order, sweet tender meat, crisp onion rings, obligitory tomato and lettuce all held together with a steak knife on a dissapointing bun. All this awesomeness could not be contained by this brioche. Fell apart as it was not so daintily enj.. okay to be honest..destroyed. Dispite the bun.   CB7- Blue cheese slaw, bacony, swiss cheesy goodness with the not so secret CB7 sauce on a pretzel roll. Good starter burger.  Sirloin steak salad- basicly a classic wedge (chopped up) salad with sliced steak.   Packed up a bit to take home.  Dessert was not an option. Though we really wanted to.  Drink specials everyday.  Sat $3 Blue Moon / Sam Seasonal. Good cold draft.  Good wine selections.  If you get a few apps.. ask them to not fire the entree for a bit. You'll want to enjoy the apps.  The entree on top of app. rush happened and the plate stacking began.  Fresh made tea.  Great experience, even better attentive staff.",

    "text": "Neighborhood joint with lots to offer.  This place has great salads and what look like good burgers, I personally have never tried one because they offer so many good salad options and tasty appetizers.  The apps are pretty standard from what I've seen at other places in Charlotte: wings,  fried pickles etc.  this was actually my first fried pickle experience and it was good. I don't really understand the whole fried pickle thing because pickles are so awesome on their own but what doesn't taste good fried?!  I love the seared tuna salad.  One of my favorites and my husband loves the French dipped sandwich.  This place is super kid friendly with a pretty decent sized kids menu that even has steak, which my 4 year old was thrilled about and they get cookies with their meal too.  Lots of cocktails offered with a full bar but I haven't been impressed by any of the cocktails yet.  I think most people come for the beer anyway which they also have lots of, both bottle and draft.  This is one of the few places in this part of town that is open pretty late and usually a go to spot after a fun dinner when we are not quite ready to end the night.  The outdoor patio is enclosed and makes for a fun summer night too!",

It isn't loaded with rabbit food which may cause a few people to turn up their noses.  I've tried another couple sandwiches, which were very good as well but I the FD is the regular.  Also, I love the tots, fried pickles, and as of this latest visit - the charbroiled wings!  The better half loves the burgers, Southwest especially.  Only thing keeping it from being a weekly, or more, frequent, is the price - it's a reasonable night out if eating in and enjoying all that the place has to offer but a little high for just sandwiches.",

My medium rare burger was a solid medium and a little on the dry side and really kind of lacked flavor. The interior was nice lots of TVs around to watch and stuff but the food was really just average.",

I asked my waitress Taya if she could have another one made with just plain carbonated water instead of bottled tonic water.  She came back with a glass of sour flat water with no alcohol in claiming it was straight carbonated water out of the tap.  It was obviously bottled sour tonic water.   Plain carbonated water does not come out of the tap tasting flat and sour.  She persisted it was and did nothing to correct it.  I don't know if it was the terrible night bar tender or ignorant waitress to blame.  Either way I just drank a beer I didn't want and paid over $80 for 3 drinks and 3 salads for a party of 3.

Decent bar area, dining room, and outdoor patio.  Lot's of televisions if you're trying to catch a game.  If you like your wings sweet/smoky I would highly recommend the Bourbon Chipotle wings done charred (it's a dollar extra but worth it).  They are on point and perfect with a beer.  I originally got that recommended to me by the bartender. I definitely will be going back.  I don't know how this place gets bad reviews!",

Not to mention the attitude that Alan feels is appropriate. Come on dude, ur a bartender in BFE. You could and should do soooo much better. Char Bar - if ur gonna suck this bad, at least get some personable people on the evening shift to peddle ur shit. Richard, the daytime tender, is way more appropriate and competent and is the reason we've given you multiple chances. Unfortunately, you're the only one in this 2 mile vicinity. Very disappointing.

I ordered the CB7 burger, Husband ordered the Leap year burger, and daughter ordered regular burger. We also ordered the fried pickles, sauce was good but they were pickle spears fried, not a lot of breading, very sour tasting. I wish the menu had been more descriptive. We also ordered the pretzles, but i never got to even taste them, devoured before I had a chance. The waitress, Ally according to my receipt, was not very attentive. My drink never got refilled once, husband had an Oberon, glass was empty, never stopped or asked if we wanted another. My daughter did get a refill. I was drinking tea, she had coke. There was a guy walking back and forth all night inside to outside, I am guessing the manager. He was a tall black guy,I stopped him at one point and asked for a to go box for the burger for our dogs. No one ever came over to ask how was everything, they seemed very understaffed. The menu was overpriced, and the burger was not great.  Another point, we asked for extra napkins, for our food, someone brought us 3 cocktail napkins. We won't be back, and if I'm in the mood for a burger, I'll go to 5 Guys.",

As we got seated we noticed that our table area seemed too dark. So I went up to the front and asked the hostess if we can change seats to another table that it was a little bigger, but had better lighting. She told me no because that specific table had more seats and they save it for large group of customers. Then, my husband noticed his seat was sticky, so we had to request a different chair. Finally our food comes out.I had ordered black chickened nachos. The nachos were cold and I felt like I was eating cold queso cheese with cold chicken. It was not good at all. Finally I had enough of eating cold nachos that I requested for them to just bring me a plate of nachos with warm cheese. They apologized, but never removed the fee from my check. I shouldn't be telling them to remove the fee. The manager should understand that customer service is important. Even after suggesting to fix my meal, they should go out of their way and not charge me. I come there and pay for my service. Otherwise, the waitress was nice and they had live music that we enjoyed listening to. I don't think will be back though:) Ohhhh, the whole time that we were there no one came to sit at that table that had more seats.",

The upside the burgers are a good size so you get a good bit of food just wish they'd give more fries with it.   Also my wife wanted to sit on the patio and it is pretty nice out there.

Fish tacos were pretty good too. The fries that came on the side though we're like heaven to me. Nice and crispy, had a nice crunch. Fried pickles with ranch are awesome. Can't get enough of those!",

Burger King has better char grilled burgers than this place. Food is average, completely lacks flavor. Perhaps people like this place due to the location, tvs, and beer. That would be it. Save yourself time and money and go somewhere else",

Our family of four walked in, with no one else waiting and were told we needed to sit on the patio or wait 15 minutes for a table.  Looking around there was a booth and at least one 6 top table open in the restaurant.  When we asked about the booth we were told it was for a reservation arriving in 15 minutes. When we asked about the 6 top we were told that the dinner rush was about to start and they couldn't sit us there.  At that point we walked out and went to Queen City Q.  The hostess was apparently a high school girl with too much authority and not enough training on customer service.",

My first visit I had the Leap Year Burger which suggests you should only have it once every 4 years because of how decadent it is. For health reasons, I would agree but for the love of God how can I have this burger only once every four years? It was DELISH and soooo bad for you, which made me like it even more. I have come to the realization that I swoon over anything that is topped with a fried egg which the Leap Year Burger has. YUMMO!!!!  Last night I had the Salmon Salad and although I appreciated the fact that they cooked my salmon as requested, Medium Rare, the salad itself was uneventful. Mixed greens with goat cheese and large rings of onion did not rock my world and the dressing that came with it, citrus vinaigrette, tasted artificial. I will most likely be sticking with their burgers.  Last night they were offering 1/2 price apps if you Liked them on Facebook. Not sure how long that special will last but it was a great way to get us to order one of their apps.. We had the Nachos and they were OK.",

I stepped into this place first holding my infant son and my teenage daughter was not to far behind as well as my girlfriend. This was my second visit and I normally give places multiple chances before writing review and this place was no different. This second visit was the same if not worst than the first visit. The service was terrible from the hostess to the waitress. The hostess was so uninterested in welcoming us and God forbid seating us with enthusiasm.  The 3 stars is from my first visit food mixed with the food we had at the second visit. Our first visit we had multiple appetizers in which we shared. They included a budget with a egg on it and fries and some chicken quesadillas. The second time I had salad, both times I had my baby with me and the hostess was pretty blow off-ish with me. There where plenty of tables available and when we entered the hostess provided blank stares both times and THE ONLY reason I went back the second time is because my friend wanted to go see her friend from college who was the executive chef at the time only to find out that he was no longer there (waste of a 2nd visit to this location).  Overall, if I were to try this place again it would be the other location in hopes that the host or hostess is not rude and unwelcoming.",

The only two things that weren't my absolute favorite were the risotto (a little underdone for my taste) and the Brussels sprouts (cooked whole, wish they would cut them in half to make them a little more tender).

Our table had a steak (I'm not a huge fan of red meat, but he enjoyed it and I took a bite - it was well cooked), the Charleston burger with pilaf, and another burger.   it's apparent the cooks are not tasting their our dishes because if the nachos were beyond over salted, the pilaf had zero flavor.  The pilaf I actually sent back for the tater tots I should have gotten in the first place.  Overall, it was a good experience, decent bar food, plenty of football games and relatively close enough to my home that I would come back.",

    "text": "This restaurant used to be great. But lately it has declined in both service and food quality. Many times we've ordered items on the menu to be told \"we're out of that\". Three times in five visits the restaurant has been out of baked potatoes! When I order a steak, I want a baked potato. Not broccoli or fruit or spinach! The weird thing is every time this happens, I have to ask the server...was this not noted a few hours ago? As in, hey we're down to 3 potatoes and it's only 6pm..perhaps we need more? Because a Publix grocery store sits less than 25 yards away from the restaurant! Twice our steaks were prepared incorrectly (one steak was completely charred black) and while the manager did bring out the redo steaks, he didn't seem very concerned or friendly. In the past, the same manager would come around to every table to inquire how was the meal/did we need anything, etc. Also I've been dismayed to discover their Tuesday night steak deal is now gone and has been replaced with Trivia Night. It would be fine if this was a bar/pub. However I was under the impression this was regarded as a nice sit down restaurant for families, couples, groups, etc. and the extremely loud atmosphere with a blaring announcer and cheesy music is one I'm sure I'll avoid in the future as well as many others who have remarked on the unpleasant environment on Tuesday nights. Also the whole trivia setup is a joke as we noted the one unfortunate time we came in on a Tuesday night that practically everyone who cannot be seen by the trivia announcer (which are many) was Googling every single question on their phones! That really isn't a fair process but since we weren't playing and ate quickly to get out of horrific noise of the once pleasant restaurant it didn't matter to us. Not sure if trivia night will continue but I know several of us who will avoid that now and although it's a lot further away, we will probably be heading to the other location on Carmel to see if their setup and availability of food items is comparable to how this location used to be.",

    "text": "Just okay, nothing special. Since we live real close by and we wanted to get something to go, we ordered take out here this evening. My wife looked at the online menu and picked out a wedge salad and was satisfied. When she was looking at the menu the image at the top is of some great looking onion rings and I thought I would like to have those as a side. I went to the restaurant to order and found out they don't have onion rings. Seems a bit strange the only image above the online menu is of something they don't even have available. I ordered a burger, specifically the Smokehouse Burger that costs $1 more than the basic burger. I ordered the Smokehouse because it came with onion strings on top - or at least that's what the menu says. I get home and find out there are no onion strings on top. Now I know they have them because I saw another dish coming out with onion strings.   Burgers seem to be somewhat of a specialty here so one would think that they would have decent fries. Unfortunately the fries are likely just frozen fries like you get in a plastic bag at the supermarket. Although the burger was pretty good, it's too bad they can't make fresh cut fries like some other places in the same price range do. When eating something that's really not so good for you, at least it should taste good.",

The bad: It's very expensive given the food options. It's $12.75 for a French Dip! I'm not stingy. I'll pay for good food but it isn't even that good. I think it's popular because there are not a lot of options in the immediate vicinity. If more restaurants were to move in, they'd be in trouble.   I've had their wings, burgers, chopped steak, salmon, and other sandwich dishes. Tonight I had the chopped steak for the first time and it was disgusting! It was full of grease and the \"jus\" as they called it was a gravy that tastes as if it had soured. I've given as many chances as I'm going to give this place. I might return for a cocktail but I'm not going to give anymore money for the terrible food here. It's too bad because it could be better.",

Chose NY strip and Filet Of Ribeye delicious! Very tender, well seasoned, and perfectly cooked to order! No joke they gave RC a little run for their money because they were darn near perfect!

They have excellent drink specials every day and the menu offers some jazzed-up traditional pub items at reasonable prices.  For instance, there are about 10 different salads you can choose from, and if none of those work for you, you can build your own.  There are even more burger options.    We usually order a sandwich/burger.  They offer MUCH more than just your typical burger with cheese, lettuce, and tomato.  Last night, I ordered the CB7 Burger, which was blue cheese cole slaw, apple wood smoked bacon, swiss cheese, and their CB7 sauce on a pretzel roll.  YUM!  You also get a few different options as a side (tater tots, please!).  All for about $10.  The burgers are always so big and flavorful, too.    We usually sit indoors at a high-top near the bar, but we have ventured outdoors once.  They have a nice, good-sized outdoor patio on the side of the restaurant that offers a great atmosphere and plenty of fresh air.",

Several servers made eye contact with us prior to us finally approaching the hostess stand complaining .

The menus could very easily be copy/pasted from each other.  The service is average, as is the experience overall.  The one big differentiator I've noticed between the two places so far is, CharBar7 usually has a nice loungey, outdoor/patio type area that is pretty nice to chill in.  Bottom line for me though is that the food just underdelivers.  It's just okay pub food.  Reading the menu, you're like - 'oh yea, that could be hella good', but then when it arrives, inevitably you wind up a bit dissapointed.  I too would echo my other yelpers on the service as well, unfortunately.  It's just not justifiable to be that inept, slow, and generally stand-off-ish.  You literally have an opportunity to make this THE local pub for about 500 homes within a 2 mile radius.  The way to do that?  have a decent venue (check) and KILL IT with service.  With remarkable service, people wouldn't notice the high price tags or average food.",

I was fortunate to be able to sample their jalapeno pimento spread.  Scrumptious!  For my entree, I chose the large house salad with no bacon and blue cheese dressing.  There was a design your own salad section, but I am so indecisive I would have been there long after my friends had left, trying to design my meal.  So many choices!

I ask, did you put my order in? Deer in the headlights. \"What did you order?\" I repeat the order. Light comes on. \"oh I can get that for you for free\". Never mind, I'm hungry, I'll go get something else. I don't have another hour to kill. Close me out. She brings me the bill..... ooooohhh I had 2 drinks not 4. Incompetent. Excuse me for not leaving a tip. I have gift cards so I have to go back. I'm not looking forward to that.",

    "text": "Parking lot is pretty hectic so it might be hard to find a space. We were sat within 5 mins. Decor and restaurant was nice and updated. We got the blackened chicken nachos (half order) and they were huge! More than enough for 2 people. The queso was good and cheesy. It had black beans and pico with cut up pieces of chicken. I got hot wings as my meal. Flavor was good and spicy. Not buttery flavor which I like! Wings were medium sized. Ranch was good. My fiance got the leap year burger. It was on an English muffin (larger than a regular one). It had beef, cheese, fried egg, bacon and lettuce and tomato. Egg was a little runny. Yolk was already dripping on the burger and it seeped on the bottom of the bun making it soggy. He liked that the English muffin was used but said it was almost not big enough to hold everything up. His burger kept breaking apart. I saw a manager stop by each table asking how everything is. Little gestures like that show you care about your customers. Tracy was our server and she was awesome and very informative about the menu! Only flaw I noticed was the bathroom. There were paper towels all over the floor as if it wasn't checked for a while. Other than that I would definitely go again!",

She came and took our drink order and offered us the special burger. We are condiment heavy people and she humored us and brought us every sauce we wanted. She then suggested some vegetarian dishes for my sister. She was so helpful and friendly. I have had good service here before but this was exceptional. We ordered the Pretzels and Fried Mushrooms for appetizers, they were fresh and hot . I had the Rib Eye Sliced Beef sandwich and my husband had the Southwestern Burger . My sister had  the Cavatappi with added Mushrooms and the Sweet Potato Tots. All of the food was spot on! Just letting you all know how good this restaurant is ! And make sure you ask for Jasmine!",

There is lots of choices for vegetarians ( they could do vegetarian tacos with their house made Black bean burger), but maybe they will if I ask.  We had an excellent server the night we went her name was Jasmine.  I'd say if you go- ask to sit in Jasmine's section as she was one of the best servers ever. Char Bar has great prices, and the food is fresh, pretty quick and their drinks are great.  I know we will continue to have this be one of our normal places to go to eat.  And I am a picky vegetarian beoutch and I love their food! Good Job Char Bar in Matthews! And awesome server Jasmine!",

Today's weather situation made it THE place to be.  This was my first experience at a Char Bar and I really enjoyed it. The server was so friendly and made great suggestions about the food. I ordered the smothered chicken that had mushrooms and onions on it, accompanied by the broccoli.  I love how the broccoli was served in a small black skillet. A+ on the presentation! The chicken dish was great and the price was right, as it was a lunch special. The inside of the restaurant looked just as cozy as the outside. I don't think this is a fine dining establishment, but if you like burgers and chicken and sandwiches and tater tots and fish and chips, this might just be your place. I like the fact that you don't have to order at a counter.  You have a servers taking care of you from start to finish.  That is somewhat of a rarity these days.  There are several Char Bars in Charlotte, and I am anxious to hit more of them.  Great lunch time experience!   Yippee.",

We just got beer as the beer prices were a little steep and we were really just thirsty and dehydrated.  My kids food came out first and it was just plain old Kraft mac n cheese.  Then my burger and wifes tenders.  my burger was cooked to order, medium, and it was perfectly warm in the middle but not a shoe.  It was juicy and tasty.  My wife said her tenders were moist and flavorful as well.    Overall it was a good experience, we got there at the right time as it was mostly empty when we arrived, but then as we left it was almost full on a Sunday Evening.",

    "text": "Reasonable service and menu ... though we've had their burgers a few times now and while not bad, they aren't all that great either ... especially for a place that touts its burgers.  It is literally the flavor of the meat ... just seems a bit off.  Perhaps it is just our preference, but have had that same point of view from several family members.  Good options for those who want a dinner salad.  Good kids menu.  Nice atmosphere (though they do get busy from time to time, and it isn't a place where I would find a wait to be worth my time).  Damning with faint praise?  Maybe I'm being too harsh.  It is a pretty good spot, hence the three stars.  The restaurant itself is visually appealing -- they did a nice job opening this relatively new location.",

    "text": "The highlight of this place is the outdoor patio and even that is overcrowded. I did like the fireplace but it was overshadowed by the TVs in every corner. The food was okay-typical bar food, nothing special, and seemingly mediocre quality at best.  The service was okay-they forgot to enter my two year old nephew's kids meal and so that made our dinner a bit stressful waiting on his food when we all had ours. I asked for a special request to have no butter or oil used in the preparation of my veggie side dish and when it came out it was clearly covered in oil. My husband's setback was well done not medium like he ordered. I also felt that service was rushed-we weren't even close to being finished and the waitress was already bringing the dessert options by. The biggest issue I had was how they had people packed in like sardines-it felt like we were practically having dinner with the other two tables closest to us and wait staff kept having to squeeze behind our chairs and bump into our table when trying to get to other patrons. I won't be heading back any time soon. I can see how my husband might want to spend a Sunday afternoon watching spots here but that's about it. I will say the woman who greeted us at the door was welcoming and friendly.",

Neither of them were supposed to be.  Didn't send it back because I don't send much back.  That's simply a cost cutting technique & completely inexcusable.  I doubt I will return.",

The burgerss were not very flavorful either.  Not what you would expect for $10-11 burgers.   Overpriced and under flavored.   I highly doubt that we will be back.  Too many better choices out there",

Fried pickles were spicier than most places ... were wedge cut Claussens I believe. Enjoyed them.  Lots of TV's but the noise level was quite low actually ...we were there around 5 on a Friday.  Seemed pricey at first, but when you factored in that the burger price included the fries, it works out about the same as ordering those separately at places like 5 guys.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere for a local pub. Lots of TV's so you won't miss watching your favorite sporting event. The bar service is awful. Not sure what the bartenders are doing most of the time, they don't really seem that busy. The service at the tables is better but can be spotty depending on the server. The food is decent. Better than the average bar food. The burgers have generally been very good. The Fish & Chips is really bad. Small pieces of fish that are either overcooked or greasy. The chips are not traditional english fries but rather fried potato chip things. Not very good either. I really like their Chicago Dog. Very tasty, but the bun is generally over toasted so it falls apart as you try and eat it. Pretty good selection of beers on tap, bottles and cans. The patio outside is a great spot to hang when the weather is nice. Overall, it's a nice place that needs a little more focus on service.",
