    "text": "When I entered this establishment at 645pm, I was the only customer on a Tuesday until the rest of my party arrived.  The bartender was very cool.  We were sat immediately and our waiter was attentive and friendly.  Strangely we were sat right next to another party of 4, even though no one else was present.  They were extremely obnoxious! We ordered from the charcuterie offerings to get things started.  All the descriptions of the items were spot on to the actual offerings.  Just thought the food offering was just not enough for the 4 of us. Entrees took a good 30 minutes due to the slow retherm of the short rib entree, which was sous vide cooking.  All well, but it would have been nice to have been told that information at the time of ordering, not when we looked like we were being ignored. Food presentation was well executed except for the pasta dish which was tossed together just like at Olive Garden.  And what is up with serving tail shells in a pasta dish? Or for any other dish that is not finger food? Really now! All my co-diners enjoyed and complimented their entree.  I asked about an ingredient in mine and got a pretentious answer that made me realize that this waiter thought over expressing the preparation of my dish was his way of expressing his knowledge and sounding good, but to a 30yr classically trained chef, he looked foolish. We will go back to experiment with more options soon.  Stay tuned!",

    "text": "As a New York City native craving haute cuisine on an extended tour of Charlotte, I was excited to hear about Dave Pasternack's Customshop restaurant.  Mr. Pasternack earned his chops under the tenure of Mario Batali, and I have previously enjoyed his excellently prepared dish of \"guitar cut\" spaghetti with sea urchin roe at Esca in NY.  I started with a crudo of (if memory serves me right) flounder and pine nuts.  For $10, 3 little bits of fish is extravagant, even by New York standards.  Our entrees of monk fish and salmon fell completely flat.  The salmon tasted like it had freezer burn, and it went unfinished.  The monk fish was well cooked, but uninspired and insipid.  Our side dish of \"custom hashbrowns\" were burnt and also went unfinished.  The only dish that was a hit in terms of taste, was the squid ink spaghetti, though it was incredibly overpriced for the portion that was served.    The menu, which sounds absolutely delicious, was poorly executed and overpriced, especially considering the market it serves.  Despite the fact I was on an expense account, I left feeling completely unsatisfied by the food.  Had I been paying out of pocket, I would have been outraged.",

Despite making a reservation, we we seated at a small table that barely held our four person party.  To say that the wait staff was ambivalent is giving them credit.  Our waiter spent more time conversing with the bartender than he did with us.  Despite informing them we were headed to a theater show and needed to leave by 7:15, our order was not taken promptly and the food was not delivered until 7:05.  My wife's tune was inedible, with lots of sinew throughout.  Given the time, we couldn't even order a replacement.  The waiter took the tuna off the bill, begrudgingly.  The other meals were really just average at best.  What peeves me the most though, was that when I called the manager to share our concern, from my car as we were now running late to our show, she indicated she would phone me back and resolve our concerns, the next day.  I've not heard back from her since then.  Don't go to Customshop.  There are many other great restaurants in Charlotte with far better attention to customer service, far better food, a more comprehensive wine/beer/drink list.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the Customshop.   The service was great and the atmosphere was pleasant. I had a glass or 2 of the red the waiter recommended and was happy with the selection.   For starters I had a Kobe beef carpaccio with homemade flat breads, micro greens and fresh grated horseradish on top. I would order it again in a heartbeat. Although I might ask for more horseradish since I am rather fond of it.   Main course I had a braised short rib along kale sauteed with maitake mushrooms. The plate was garnished with a small drizzle of a balsamic reduction. The beef was very tender. I did not have to pick up my knife once. The kale was not at all bitter and not overcooked. I like seeing kale on a \"trendy\" menu. I would order this again as well.   I tried my friend's salmon that was crisp seared on the outside and juicy in the middle. It was served over a cream sauce that I think had a touch of marscapone in it. It was nicely done even though said friend ordered it medium-well and not my normal rare or med-rare. =)   For dessert, I have to admit, I skipped since Elizabeth Creamery is right next door.   This place is not known for massive portions. I was satisfied when I left. Not stuffed which was good. It is pricey but the relaxed atmosphere and tasty food make up for that. It is near the top of the list when I get to take out business associates for local flavor.",

OK - I'll get the bad out of the way.    The fish crudo.  It's overpriced.  Was it good? ehh.  It was OK.  In fact, the fish was still frozen.  I would not order this again.    A cocktail off of their list - it was $12 if I recall and completely not worth it.  Seriously - $12 for gin and juice?  Pass.   The good - I had a really good glass of wine.  Was not completely overpriced.  I think it was about $10 - good for the price.    I had a braised meat pasta.  It was very good and not overpriced at all.  I would absolutely get this again.  I really don't remember what my girlfriend had...  sorry!  Service - Our waiter was nice and pretty attentive.  I guess he should be, given we were the only ones around.  I would still go back again.   Good tip - I have heard they have the best brunch in town.  Can't confirm, just a rumor....",

A dinner experience there was a lot of fun; the food was very good (octopus with bar b q sauce, strange as it sounds it was real tasty as a starter) wine selection was OK and moderate in price. I would not describe this as an upscale place or put it in the same category as Carpe Diem across the street. The service was typical for what can best be described as an \"East Village\" type of restaurant. The only caveat I would pass along is not to sit in the first three booths by the door, it can be annoying with people coming and going. I would go back especialy those times I want a modern hippie experience and a good time..",

Every experience has been AMAZING!  The guys who wait on you are very charming (if you like that sort of thing) and helpful.  I LOVE the ambiance.  The giant mirrors with rows of candles below create a calm and relaxing feel great for any romantic night or friend gathering. The Ricotta Gnocchi is heavenly, I have ordered this multiple times..Love the Crispy Duck Breast and you always have to order the cheese plate to start or the Beef Carpaccio or the Scallops...I could go on and on about each item...You would be a fool not to order the Bread Pudding or the Chocolate Souffle (or both).  There is an amazing chef in that kitchen.  I left off the PEI muscles with Chorizo, fantastic!!!  I have only had two let downs- Chicken Liver Pate (was ordered by someone else in my party, but of course had to try it.  People do rave about this item) and my grilled Wahoo was very dry (I should have returned it and I'm sure they would have prepared another piece)... They do change their menu frequently which can be a let down when you have your heart set on something that is now gone and never to be seen/tasted again!  But it's also great to try their new items.  It is a bit pricey but worth every dollar...",

    "text": "Customshop was the first restaurant I ventured out to when I moved from DC two years ago. I was very hesitant as I had become quite a foodie, but I was so impressed with the service, the quality of food, and the overall experience. It has been my go to place when friends come into town or for a special occasion.   Well last night was one of those special occasions in which my boyfriend and I had planned a romantic evening. They had changed the seating in the restaurant so we actually were seated right next to another two top and basically had dinner with them we were so close, and let's just say they were not the type of couple we wanted to have dinner with on our romantic evening. We asked to move and were given a quick no response, along with attitude from the person at the front. When it came to ordering entrees it became a hot mess.....the waiter informed me that the fish I wanted was no longer available that evening and my go to scallop dish was not on the menu. I initially ordered saffron fettuccine. The waiter came back ten minutes later to inform me they no longer had the saffron fettuccine. I then ordered the gnocchi with shrimp. Fifteen minutes later he came by to inform me they were out of the shrimp for that dish. He said I could combine the gnocchi with my original order and make that happen. I said fine----however, he came back yet again informing me that he could not do that either. I ordered squid ink fettuccine with calamari at that point because it was my only other option. So we have now been at the restaurant for well over an hour with nothing to eat....we had to ask for bread- which they usually bring in heaping portions and a major highlight of the restaurant. At one point when the table next to us asked about their appetizer (they had been waiting for well over half an hour for mussels), the waiter walked away throwing his hands up in the air!  The food was no where near as good as it has been in the past, including their always delicious crudo.  I left so disappointed last night- it has gone from being my favorite restaurant in Charlotte to I'm not sure I'll ever go back again!",

That said, the food was all of great quality and nicely presented. Sampled the octopus and chicken liver pate from the small plates side, and both were tasty - though very lopsided on the portion. The octopus was a little on the small side and the chicken liver was an enormous portion that 2 people had a tough time finishing. My entree was a special (tilefish if I recall) and while cooked perfectly, it suffered for being bathed in a bit too much sauce. The cocktail menu was inventive - but the drinks just missed the mark a little bit in being perfect. From what I hear there is a discount night on all food if you dine at the bar - which I would think would be an awesome way to enjoy this place! Great place for small groups - might not be the place for a romantic dinner for 2 on a weekend though.",

We went with Prosciutto, Chorizo, Chicken Liver Pate, with Manchego & Mimolette cheeses; It provided a great way to open the meal over initial drinks.)   Starter: 3/5 (We had the Pork Belly (awesome), although the bed of beans it was served over were pretty undercooked..)  Pasta: 4.5/5 (all Pasta made in house, we had Ricotta Gnocchi which was great in our opinion)   Main Course: 3.5/5  (We had Pork Chop, Duck, Short Rib, Lamb, & Whole Fish. Only complaints were execution...I hate to sound critical, but the Pork was a little chewy and definitely overcooked; same with the Duck...The Short Rib/Lamb & others were amazing though, and the review would have been higher had there not been the 2 critical temperature mistakes on the big ticket items)   Dessert: N/A So, we had to stop somewhere!....Looked amazing though (Pumpkin Creme Brulee & Brioche bread pudding), that will be next time.   The Charcuterie & Cheese plate(s) were definitely the highlight of the meal.   I thought the wine was fantastic (2007 Row Eleven Pinot Noir), server was knowledgable with the pairings, and overall a great dining experience.

The menu is already very short and limited, so in hindsight they probably shouldn't have even sat us since food wasn't really available. Some of us shared 'the last entree' of a particular type to make things work. The food overall was solid, but not what it has been in the past. Orecchiette and linguine were pretty good. The bread was great. Service continued to disappoint, with servers hustling at the end of the night cleaning up all around us while we were enjoying our later-than-planned dinner. She rushed us out at the end though everyone was drinking nice wine, closed the ticket and that was that. The food didn't measure up to what it has in the past and the service was a complete let-down. For this kind of money, patrons expect and deserve more. Something has changed at 'The Shop.'",

    "text": "Atmosphere: B Food: A- Service: B+  I would certainly return.    The service began unevenly, but once our waiter was aware of our existence, I have no complaints.  Attentive without hovering, the timing was spot on.  The bar is pleasant, the seating as well, but the decor is not notable.  I cannot recall any of the artwork on the walls, if there was any.  I suppose the style was rustic-upscale-trendy, if that is such a thing.   But to save the best for last, the food was excellent.  The cheese selection alone would be enough to return for, as were the small place selections.  I think we could have made a meal of just returning to both of those menus again and again; seriously, it would have been just as delightful to sit at the bar and enjoy just about anything off those two menus.  I liked that the entrees were limited to perhaps five offerings--that is a perfect number to provide enough options and maintain the high quality.  The presentation of the dishes was appealing to the eye, well balanced color and texture.  Top notch!",

We shared an amazing bottle of red wine. The Pork Belly appetizer, which we both agreed (in silence while devouring it) was perfectly cooked and swimming in an amazing broth (use the bread they offer to savor every drop). I had the grilled grouper special that was surrounded by clams. It was so full of flavor and incredibly seasoned. He had the smoked Duck which was cooked perfectly. Paired with a grilled peach that really added a nice touch of sweetness. I plan to go back soon and have my way with a cheese & charcuterie board.",

The service has always been great and though they don't appear on Find Me Gluten Free (for any fellow Celiac disease people who use the app), they actually do have lots of gluten free options, and the servers are very knowledgeable and careful with my food when I mention I need a GF dish.

The restaurant is lovely and the service was great but unfortunately the food was not.    Based on a quick glance at the yelp reviews and a few recommendations from the bartender (we sat at the bar which I actually really enjoyed) we ordered the BBQ octopus, brussel sprouts, and the ricotta gnocchi with butternut squash.  I'd never had octopus before, but based on the bartender's recommendation we went for it. Neither my husband or I enjoyed it, but I will note that there is the potential that we just don't like octopus. The brussel sprouts were fine, but honestly just sauteed without much seasoning. The ricotta gnocchi was my least favorite. Ricotta is already bland and nothing in the dish changed that.  I enjoyed the ambiance and service at Customshop, but unfortunately the food was not worth it.",

We were seated against the window, in a booth, which was nice.  Unfortunatey a party of over 15 girls, maybe for a girls dinner, arrived and were seated next to us, which I have no issue, but the place is small so the noise level was very hard.  I felt like the two of us were screaming at each other just to have a conversation. We started with the pork belly and tuna appetizer.  I have never had pork belly so it wasn't something I enjoyed by my date did.  The tuna was amazing, something we both loved!   After two more drinks we decided to order one small plate and one entree to share.  The menu, unfortunately, is very limited..meat centric, and was told they were out of the Tuna.  So, not too many options for me, but the special was a Tile Fish. We chose the skirt steak appetizer and the Tile fish entree. Both were SO overcooked.  The skirt steak had a nice flavor, but needs to be cooked right and sliced correctly to be good.  The tile fish was so overdone is was disappointing.  I think I would return for a drink and appetizer, but was not impressed with the entree menu and the entrees were experienced that evening.",

Buratta was not even buratta- it was frozen motzorella.    Entrees were all very bland- special duck was extremely bland. Pastas were just as bad with no seasoning or flavor.   Ordering wine was a special task in itself as they were out of the first two we ordered.   Didn't really seem like anyone cared here. Service was ok and waitress was nice but seriously- for the price... There are much better places to go. We will never go back.",

I started dinner off with a tequila cocktail. It was pretty sweet, but you could still taste the tequila.   My party shared the charcuterie, but it wasn't very special. Probably the one thing on the table that wasn't necessary.   The Brussel sprouts were delicious. They had lots of flavor. And the Tuna (main dish) didn't disappoint either. The sauce that comes with the fish, covering the cauliflower was amazing!  I couldn't get enough of it.   The rabbit confit and pasta was a star at our table. It tied for first place with the Pork Belly (small plate). The Pork Belly had the perfect glaze on it!  It was crunchy, but it still melted in your mouth.   I can't wait to head back.

Their menu is the right size with lots of options for meat eaters and vegetarians alike, but it's not so huge that you're like \"okay, I think I can narrow down my food choices to the options listed on pages 14 and 35 only.\" I ate every last bit of food on my plate, and some of the food on my husband's plate, too.

    "text": "I really liked the idea of this restaurant, locally sourced food and an ever changing menu to accommodate ingredients. Although the overall Yelp rating is middling, it seems alot of the lower reviews were from a couple of years ago and more recent reviewers were stronger, so I was excited to try Customshop.  Unfortunately, my meal in November 2013 was uneven. Some dishes were 5-star and some were 2-star. Four small plates, two cocktails, one dessert and one coffee ran $80, which was fair.  The space is small and attractive. I made an Open Table reservation a couple of days ahead, but apparently you have to reserve even further ahead than that to get a booth. Fair enough, and a small table (enough room for two water glasses, two drink glasses, two small plates, and one entree) is usually fine for the \"tapas\" option we were having as I was expecting the dishes to be brought out one at a time. Unfortunately, three of the small plates were ordered were all brought out at the same time. I ended up having to eat my pork belly, which was hot, before my burrata di buffalo, which was cold.  Had I known everything was going to be brought out when we ordered it I would have ordered the dishes one at a time in the order I wanted to eat them.  In terms of quality, from high to low, I had:  5-star: Bread pudding. Probably the best I have had, and I have bread pudding whenever it is on the menu. The bread was moist and all of the sweet buttery goodness of flavor was captured in the bread - no syrup or sauce poured over.   5-star: Beef carpaccio. Simply presented with salt, pepper, oil, and fresh horseradish, but wonderfully melt-in-your-mouth tender and flavorful. I was left wanting much much more of this.  4-star: Shrimp ceviche. Carolina shrimp were tender but the promised heat from the jalapeno was not there. Could also have used a spoon to work with the sauce.  2-star: Pork belly. Unevenly cooked and underseasoned. A big disappointment.  2-star: Burrata di bufala with roasted beets and pistachios. The burrata was bland and the beets exhibited little roasting flavor. The best part of this dish was the arugula salad which housed the pistachios.  I would love to give Customshop another try, though with many good restaurants to choose from in Charlotte I do not know if I will be able to.",

Started w/ the Duck and Rabbit Terrine w/ dates and pistachios and a Cheese and Charcuterie plate. Had the Tuna Crudo and Beef Carpaccio. Finished off w/ the 1/2 Duck that was on the specials list. Wouldn't have changed any of it. Service was great.",

Our bill was $300 with tip and after we finished our meal, paid, and were sitting around chatting with each other the manager came up to us. We assumed he was asking us how our meal was, but he came to let us know we had 5 minutes to leave because another reservation had \"already been waiting for 30 minutes.\" His name is Schuyler Munroe. Extremely unprofessional. I have never been asked to leave after spending money at a restaurant in my life. Then we asked him to come over and speak with us about it. He explained to us that \"he is frustrated because he has had to comp other guests drinks and food because we were sitting at this table\" okay that has nothing to do with me. The food and customer service by our specific server was great, but after the manager came and spoke with us and made us feel like we weren't welcomed I will never come back here again. Truly disappointed with our overall experience.",

    "text": "Went here for brunch on Sunday.  Truthfully I wasn't very impressed.  The place was rather empty for a \"brunch rush\" time and yet the employees seemed annoyed that we even showed up.  Maybe they were hoping to get by with not having to work the entire day but it made for a very awkward first impression.  I should have known I was in for a \"treat\" when the server brought over two complimentary, microscopic scones to kick start our great brunch experience.  They were freakin GOOD but I needed chopsticks to pick them up.  They were soooo itty bitty.  The menu was limited and the prices were on the high end, especially after I saw the portions.  I ordered the frittata and it had chorizo, ricotta and potatoes in it.  There was three pieces of chorizo---seriously, I counted, the cheese was so bland and flavorless it should have been left off and there were 3 potatoes that were hard and crunchy, which made no sense.  It was a small portion so needless to say I was still hungry after my 5 bites.  My husband ordered the benedict which he seemed to enjoy but again, he left hungry.  The benedict was served with a side of potatoes and I think I counted 5 on his plate.  That's just brutal...no getting around it.  I get that this place is more upscale and the food is supposed to be top of the line but I am confident there are better brunch places with just as good of quality (if not better), where you will leave satisfied and not broke.  Zada Janes is just about 5 minutes away...just sayin'...  I wouldn't come back unless invited by others.",

    "text": "Wow, Customshop impressed us! My husband and I didn't travel for the holidays and we decided to try a new restaurant for Christmas Eve. It had been a while since my last visit (Elite event way back in the day) and I thought this may be a good, quiet place to dine. It was fantastic.  We made reservations, which are recommended...and if you want a booth, supposedly you have to make those months in advance. Who knows where they'll be eating that far in advance? Not this girl. Anyway, the tables were fine although a booth would have been slightly cozier.   The service was great! Attentive, but not intrusive and in no way did we ever feel rushed. The wine list was extensive, but not overwhelming. We started with the cheese plate followed by our main entree and vegetables. It was just the right amount and made deliciously! I had the scallops and they were divine!   Besides the quality of the food, the ambiance and visual presentation is top notch. The decor is rustic, yet classy. They know how to set the mood with dim lighting and dining by candlelight. The food is thoughtfully placed on the dishes and is picture perfect and ready to eat.  I love that this place is local and rotates its menu to reflect what food is seasonal. I also like that they support area farms and add where they get their items on the bottom of their menu. It's like a win-win-win: us-them-community. Yay.  It's a new local favorite and I'm sorry it took me so long to return. Now that it's on the list of great places, we'll be back soon and happy to recommend to others.",

My wife and I are pretty out going and like to engage the servers and bartenders.  Our server Anthony had zero personality, never really made eye contact and was not personal at all.  Everyone working there was a DUDE.  I really don't mind being helped by men at all, but really everyone on staff?  Created a real weird environment.  We were both starving and order a cheese plate right away.  We both mentioned have a gluten allergy  and it not only come with the crackers on it he sat it down and never really shared what was what.  The food was ok at best.  For a $40 steak with no sides there are a number of better choices.  We salvaged the night by going for dessert at our favorite place Fig Tree.  The only problem was as we got there my wife started getting sick, probably from the food that wasn't completely gluten free.  She still doesn't feel well this am.  I wouldn't recommend the place or go back.",

We were the first ones there when they opened at 10:00, and we were still the only ones there when we left.  Maybe that's why we had great service?  Whatever the reason, I'll  take it!  I've always loved the atmosphere - exposed brick, black and caramel booths/tables, cozy feel.  For brunch, we were greeted with warm scones and boysenberry jam.  YUM.  I got the marscapone and blueberry french toast ($12).  I don't normally like a mouthful of whole blueberries, but these were warm and delicious, and the marscapone gave it just enough creaminess.  I almost didn't even need the maple syrup.  My fella got the eggs benedict ($12) and loved that the poached eggs weren't runny.   It also came with prosciutto instead of canadian bacon, which was a neat twist, but they were a little stingy on the meat.  I also need to give the coffee a special award; it was rich and delicious.  Then again, it oughta be for $3.50.    I also need to point out the fantastic soundtrack.  It's a nice start to the day to listen to Pink Floyd, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash and The Allman Brothers.  We'll definitely give dinner another chance soon and hope it lives up to brunch.",

Even though I ordered cheese for the appetizer and Brussel spouts (the latter never came to the table) I had to remind them of the order.

Nice ambiance, while our waiters were knowledgable and efficient and friendly, not a fan of wait staff that aren't cross trained or authorized (?) to handle all requests.   We tried a bunch of dishes - we started with the olives. Excellent. We then had a meat and cheese platter - the items with their accompaniments were all excellent. We especially liked the chorizo and the country pate.  I ordered the WTF pork chop with spaetzel - solid dish, though the pork chop could have been a bit more juicy. overall the dish was solid. I also tried my coworker's dishes - pumpkin gnochi was delicous as was the ricotta gnocchi with eggplant. My other coworker's ribeye deckle was also delicious, though still not entirely sure what part of the cow is the deckle. Nice to see some interesting cut.  We ordered a side of brussel sprouts which were delicious. Even the people at the table who didn't like brussel sprouts loved them. I swear, brussel sprouts taste much better now than they did when I was a kid. The only dissapointment of the night was the potato fingerlings with horseradish. No heat - just some boring roasted potatoes.  Wine service was solid with a lot of interesting choices.  I'd highly recommend this place for a comforting meal.",

We didn't have a reservation so we snuck in early and were lucky enough to get a booth, which are definitely more comfy than the interior tables (just like any restaurant).   I have always loved their interior, lighting and vibe. To me, this is the perfect size of a restaurant- cozy, small, neighborhoody, exclusive.  It is not a place you go everyday because of the cost and small menu size which is the reason I docked it a star. They change up the menu and this time there were only 2-3 entrees I could eat because of my rule that I won't eat an animal I've had as a pet and I've had a lot of pets.   Anyway, our wonderful waiter Bill was friendly, funny and attentive. He introduced us to Black Slate piorat wine which became my husband's new favorite wine! We noshed on the delicious bread drizzled with divine olive oil and fresh crushed black pepper- OMG.  Then we ordered the scallops and I had the whole fish special (snapper) with preserved lemons and pesto tossed arugula which was heaven on a plate. Hubby's scallops were perfect for someone on a diet, and definitely a \"chick\" dish so it was good that my fish was large enough to share. And he had a big cake at home for me. If I were planning to have scallops next time, I would also order the beef carpaccio or another starter. At the end of the night, the bill was $125.  I enjoyed it immensely so we were happy paying it.   I have had their squid ink pasta before with a different prep and it was wonderful.  Unfortunately I'm not a charcuterie/cheese person at all, so that specialty is wasted on me entirely. That's OK, I enjoy every other part of it.  I don't think I've ever had a dessert here (shocker) because I tend to get homemade ice cream next door at Elizabeth Creamery.",

The venue itself is awesome- beautiful candles line the walls and big comfy booths are there to relax in. This is the type of restaurant where you stay and relax for awhile.  Started with some excellent wine selections - our server was more than accommodating in this arena.   Wasn't very impressed with the fried goat cheese. They were sort of bland and I was hoping for a savory dish rather than sweet.   The Ahi tuna and scallops were amazing - as were the two gnocchi dishes I tasted.  So while they missed the boat on the appetizer, they definitely made up for it with the entrees. The meals were both creative and tasty, so I look forward to my next visit!",

I've read a few of the bad reviews on here and it seems like they either have a unfounded problem with this establishment or are completely ignorant to what an amazing dining experience should consist of.  When people complain about things like I've read on here it shows there pretentiousness.  The service is up there with the best I've ever had, the prices for the quality of ingredients is on par with any other restaurant, the chefs are some of the most creative in the country and the owner truly cares about every single aspect of bringing cutting edge cuisine.  I truly hope this review might help someone look beyond a few inexperienced reviews, from people that haven't traveled and experienced real upscale and creative dining and give Custom Shop a try.

I can understand that a bad experience there could really turn you off -- it isn't an inexpensive night out, and I suspect the food they serve could alienate the Groupon crowd that they have cultivated (I count 3 or 4 Groupons in the last year). But we've had nothing but really exceptional meals.  We have alternated cheese/charcuterie and crudo for two the last few times, and enjoy them both. I have succumbed to the pork chop several times because it is awesome, but have also enjoyed their specials.  It would be a five-star restaurant except for the jacked-up wine prices (nearly 200% -- $14 bottle for $39) and the occasional snooty server experience. But neither have distracted us from making this one of our \"Top-5 Restaurants in Charlotte.\" It would be 4.5 stars if such a rating existed.",

Although they weren't on the menu, the bartender made one up.  That's the good part.  The not so good: it was about half full and only once we got the bill did we realize they were $12 apiece.  Combined with my weak mixed drinks, a $50 (with tip) tab for four mediocre drinks left us with a sour taste in our mouths.  Sitting at the end of the bar next to the door is esp awkward.

Instead of cramming in as many tables as possible, perhaps they should have inlcuded a little more room for people to, I don't know, get in the door and wait to be seated.  The food might be great but I'm in no hurry to go back and find out.",

    "text": "Had dinner at Customshop last night with a friend.  We were seated promptly.  The wine list was decent though some of the by glass options were grossly overpriced.  (Granted, most wine by the glass is overpriced, but in this case I was somewhat shocked.)    The main reason I was brought here was to try their charcuterie.  Three meats (salame Toscana, prosciutto, and sweet dry sausage) along with two cheeses - Roaring 40s blue and Manchego.   The meats were excellent and well portioned. The cheeses were good, but the portions were minute. When compared to Good Food, even the now gone yet venerable Las Ramblas - it was very disappointing.  During this time our server started to really pressure us into making our decision for a main course, siting an 11-top that would delay our dinner if we got stuck behind them.  We looked after he left and there was no such group at that time.  However, we placed our starters and main orders asking them to take their time.    My friend had the Ambrosia Corn salad and said it was excellent.  I had the carpaccio which was divine.  If you're a beef person, and you like carpaccio - this is some of the best I've ever had and it was very well presented. Normally I get worried when I see \"horseradish\" on a carpaccio because it is usually way more than necessary. Customshop put just enough that it is discernible on the palate but it doesn't over power or burn. It was far more in the nose than on the tongue.    For our main course - my friend had the potato gnocchi with lamb ragu and i had the duck confit.  The duck was superb. Well cooked, tender, worked well with the salsify, fingerling potoatoes, and fig reduction.  My friend, however, did not have an ideal experience.   The gnocchi was overcooked, and the sauce was tasteless- with the lamb well past being over cooked even for a ragu.   It lacked any type of salt in the dish.  Our waiter, noting that the bowl of ragu wasn't being touched, asked what was going on.  To Customshop's credit, they sent out the ricotta gnocchi with rabbit and tomato.  It was amazingly good.  A far cry from the mess that was previously there.    Dessert comes around chocolate souffle and bread pudding are ordered.  The bread pudding took the prize.  Custard-y and delicious it was one of the best bread puddings in Charlotte.  The chocolate souffle, however, lacked any serious depth to it.  The chocolate was there, and the sugar was there - but once the taste on the front end left, it was gone.  It also seemed rather undercooked in places.  During dessert, the server placed the check on the table - not even asking if we might want more wine or coffee.  Again, the rushed feeling.   Somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars seems fair.  The food was hit and miss.  When you got something good - it was excellent, but when you got something bad, it wasn't worth eating.   The service, for the most part was good - but the rushed feeling was not.  As we were getting ready to leave, the 11-top was just coming in.",

    "text": "This place is ROCK SOLID.  (3 stars is very good from me, I'm trying to fight star inflation)  Really good restaurants are really really scarce in Charlotte, but Customshop is squarely on the list of really good ones (a very short list).  We went in on a rainy Monday and while it wasn't packed they were doing a good business.  The cheese/olive/charcuterie selections are very good.  They could have probably parted with a little more of the prosciutto but what the heck.  Terrific wine list.  Some excellent selections at almost every price point.  Two spots that they did fall down on in this area were vintages that are not up to date on the list, and high end red wines are served at room temperature.  We had an excellent 2006 Palacios that was as warm as bathwater.  This even after I specifically asked if the reds were kept in a cooler?  Management should address this issue immediately.   We split a butter lettuce salad, it was simple and excellent.  My date had the saffron fettuccine with shrimp, it was delicious.  I had the crispy duck breast and it too was very good.  Some of the reviews here seem to indicate that people think the duck breast isn't \"crispy\" enough, I thought it was fine.  In addition, our server was aware of this issue and talked with us about it up front.  Speaking of servers, ours (nice young NYU grad) did a fine job and was very pleasant (but I was disappointed about the temperature of the wine).  The room is very very well done from an ambiance perspective.  Net/net, the people at Customshop should be proud.   I do not live in Charlotte full-time but am often there.  I can't remember the last time I left a restaurant in Charlotte thinking \"you know, that was really really good\"....Customshop fills the void!  By the time we finished they were ready to close so can't comment on the desserts but I will be back another time to check those out!!  Keep up the good work.",

Ordered chorizo fritatta which was really good with just a nice kick from the chorizo.  Used the Elderflower Mimosa to tame the spice - and just to make sure the fire was all out - have another Mimosa - hey it was Mom's Day and Mom wanted a Mimosa!  All in all, very nice brunch.  Only complaint was for sweet potato hash and rib eye, rib eye was very fatty and not that flavorful which was odd - think it needed more seasoning during the grilling process - was just not very flavorful for that cut of meat.",

Visited here for restaurant week and although sitting at the bar may not have been the best idea, in the end our bartender \"Chip\" was very attentive and explained the menu to us fully and made up for the entire evening.   Onto my main course. The yellowtail tuna (imported from hawaii) Deliciously seared with pepper and some other fine marinates. Delicious and well proportioned. My date enjoyed the tuna meatballs and pasta dish which was also delicious and was served with house made pasta. Both dished were delightful  I had the bread-pudding desert and all I have to say is HOT DAMN THAT SHIT WAS GOOD!!!",

Our course came out at different time for different members of our 4 guest party, sometimes as much as 5 minutes between when the first person got their plate until the last.  Some of the food was outstanding, the BBQ octopus, some had no flavor at all, the spicy tuna meatballs. Some would have been excellent, the duck breast, if there was enough sauce to go with the nice sized portion.    All this coupled with service that mirrored the food. There were times when it was attentive and professional and others, they must cherish their water because trying to get a refill is a chore, that the servers seemed pre occupied with the theory of relativity.    Customshop has great promise if it only had consistency",

Whenever I go here I always grab a seat at the bar and start with a glass of wine (heavy pour in a mini-carafe) and the meat and cheese plate, which they usually make right behind the bar for you by a chef. Bartenders are very knowledgeable and will strike up a conversation with ease. Take their advice on the new wines or drink specials, you won't be disappointed.   Gnocchi is great, as well as the desserts are awesome. I hardly resist the bread pudding. They sure put the love in the food! This is a local place that had some challenges with the trolley construction and deserves to stay and be a local vibrant joint in the Midtown/Elizabeth scene.   PS - you'll enjoy the scenery in the restrooms :)",

Unfortunately that was not the case this time. I felt compelled to write a review after our experience. We ordered the cheese and charcuterie to start. The waitress brought out the wrong order but that is completely forgivable as she corrected it quickly. She said the cheese won a gold star for some cheese award so of course we had to have it. The cheese was well cheese. I am not a connoisseur of cheese but it was pretty good. Honestly I could have made this plate at home. Ok so then we ordered the BBQ Octopus small plate, again another Charlotte Observer favorite suggested by the waitress. The plate was just well weird. The ony octoupus tentacle lacked flavor other than a very burnt grill taste. Not their best dish by far. After that we had the beef carpaccio. My date had never tried it before and it is too bad he tried it here. The beef is supposed to be sliced thinly with olive oil and pepper and salt. This meat was thicker and was covered in horseradish. You could not taste the flavor of the meat at all. We had to scrape the horseradish off the and the fennel they sliced. The other thing is their complimentary bread. It was very dry and again nothing to write home about. Needless to say, I will not be going back. I think if you stick with the large plates you will be ok but their small plates lack flavor and are just weird.",

We were impressed by the charming and comfortable interior design and overall ambiance. Our waiter, Joe, was a friendly and accommodating fellow who answered our questions and gave excellent recommendations.   We had ordered BBQ Octopus as a small plate and were delighted when we were served a grilled tentacle that was tender and flavorful. If you love seafood as much as we do, this is worth coming back to alone! My partner had ordered Smoked Duck and I, the Potato Gnocchi for our main entrees. Both dishes did not disappoint. Again, best duck we've ever had--just the right amount of crisp on the skin and juicy softness in the meat. There were so many great things going on there too with the candied cabbage, figs, and spaetzle. My dish in contrast to his had savory crawfish and pork sausage, both of which complimented the smooth, creaminess of the gnocchi.  All the food we tasted we just loved, and to top it off, the Chocolate Souffle is die for! It had a subtle espresso taste about it which went well with a scoop of their mocha ice cream. My partner who typically doesn't care for chocolate was smiling ear-to-ear. We can't say enough good things about our experience with The Customshop. It has definitely made it's way to one of our Charlotte favorites. If you're looking for a special night out and have an adventurous palate, this restaurant offers a nice variety of dishes with well-balanced flavors.",

But even after we complained about the lengthy wait for our main dishes, it was nearly another 20 minutes before our food made an appearance.

One thing I do not see enough of are high held praise for Custom Shop.  Custom Shop is one of the restaurants that helped seed the culinary scene in our town, and I think often gets overlooked by the latest and greatest.  The simple fact is there are few places in Charlotte, old or new, that execute with at same level.  CS knows what it set out to do, and does it very well.

The tuna was beautiful, but was floating in some serious liquid and oil. The server talked about how delicious this liquid would be and don't we want to dip the bread in it? Between the liquid and the spicy sauce on it, the taste of the beautiful tuna was completely masked and the liquid was not a savory delight... I can't believe what a completely different experience we had. I don't think I'll be back.",

The honeycomb was artistic but lost on taste- beets were tough and blackberries over ripe, and the pastry severed with it was bland and missed. The tuna meatballs were fishy with a flavor and texture that was unappealing and really undesirable. After a bite- we left the rest bc it was so unappetizing.   The service has been exceptional both times. Can tell people really care about what they do. Also, the bread that was brought out was very nice- good quality olive oil.

I sort of like the appetizers.  Although, hmmm... they are unmemorable as I can't remember what we tried.  We didn't have dinner here, so I can't really comment on the quality of the food.  I sort of like the cocktails.  They have a Campari Cocktail which was good.  I sort of like the bartender/server.  He acted a bit \"not with it\" sometimes, though.  I probably won't go back, but I would recommend it to others just based on the other Yelpers great reviews.",

The Tomato and Pimento Linguine's flavor was over powered by the smokiness of the Surryano ham ( not a fan).  The Skillet Brussel Sprouts were incredible and the highlight of the meal.

    "text": "I really want to give this place two stars, but the touch of complimentary service brings this place up to three stars.  Came here after work on a Tuesday last month to meet up a couple of friends and try out their happy hour/appetizer menu.  FOOD - We tried a bevy of appetizers to go with our drinks while sitting at the bar.  Maybe it was our selection, but everything just kinda tasted the same.  What a misnomer, huh?  Should be Customshop Blandcrafted Food.  Without going through the apps, the one item I thought was really good is the carpaccio.  Wasabi-fiends would appreciate the hint of wasabi on the carpaccio, it really gives it a good kick (and takes care of allergies).  SERVICE - Maybe we looked like a couple of fatties or something, but the bartender brought us out a free skirt steak to enjoy.  Literally get an extra star for that.  It's not so much the free factor, but they saw we were having a good time, the alcohol was flowing, and really just trying all the food.  Bold and confident to be like, \"Yo, try this steak out, son - it's bomb-deez!\"  Okay, bartender didn't say it in those words, but you get the drift.  AMBIANCE - Tuesday hh is dead, or at least, the day that we went.    I probably won't suggest this place, but wouldn't mind returning here if some peeps wanted to go here.  That's almost strictly for the carpaccio.  dmo out",

I don't eat pork or beef yet almost every single dish had both as ingredients. I wanted to order the spicy tuna meatballs as an appetizer and even those are made with ham. The waitress let me know they could do pasta without meat but why pay $28 for vegetarian pasta? I ended up ordering a TINY salad for my dinner that was nothing to write home about. My husband did order a steak and he was not impressed either. He did like the bbq octopus app, however.  I do not feel like this restaurant's menu caters to all types of eaters. Vegetarians or vegans, proceed with caution.  The ambience and service is five star, though, so I stuck with three stars instead of two. We won't be going back due to the limited menu options.",

The main course plates, for the price, were extremely small - and we aren't fill the whole plate people, but  a little accompaniment is always nice.  The ravioli was just fine..but again, they too came out room temp.  The cocktails and suggested wine with our main courses were exceptional and well chosen by our sever.

Unfortunately our poor experience started right off the bat. We were immediately seated and given water glasses, but no waiter checked on us for 10 minutes until someone finally checked in. We just went ahead and made an order for the grilled octopus and chicken liver pate, planning on splitting both small plates. The grilled octopus was just okay. It was a little tough, which is almost expected with octopus/squid, but also tasted overwhelmingly of lemon. It wasn't bad but not a standout either. The chicken liver pate was really, really bad on the other hand. I can't even describe the taste, just incredibly offputting. We both tried two bites and couldn't stomach any more. The chocolate oatmeal bread on the side was okay, but not quite as delicious as it sounds. We were still very hungry so decided to try the ricotta gnocchi. They were incredibly soft gnocchi, like falling apart soft. The ricotta didn't add much flavor and the sauce tasted of too much tomato and not enough seasoning in my opinion. The sausage in the sauce was excellent, however.  Overall, we felt like we had 2 average at best dishes and 1 bad miss and decided it would be best to cut our losses, pay up our $55, and go home to eat some leftovers in order to actually be full.",

We had a great meal that night and have now returned a couple more times. With several visits under our belts, I felt it was time to put in a review. The most recent visit started with adult beverages, I went with the blood orange negroni and the wife chose a glass of wine. Clearly, I'm not a negroni man because I didn't realize that this was a gin drink. No problem, I like gin and I was enticed by the blood orange anyway which made for a good flavor combo for me. The wife enjoyed her white wine, Chardonnay I believe.  For appetizers, the wife was torn but ultimately went with the burrata which came with some apricot jam and sadly only one piece of grilled bread. The bread was great, but more was needed especially due to the generous portion of burrata. I guess that we could have inquired about more. The bread nazi didn't shoot us down, we just didn't ask. I can vouch for the burrata and it was very good as the wife generously shared. I still got my own app which was a blue fin tuna belly. It also came with pork belly and the tuna was slightly cooked by pouring hot broth over it just before it was served. The pork belly was well cooked and the tuna belly fresh, but the broth was over the top good. Our sever even brought me over a spoon so that I could savor very last drop.   For mains, I kept it in the tuna family and this time got the yellow fin tuna and it was just seared to perfection keeping the tuna the star of the show to go along with the accompanying cauliflower puree and smoked almond romesco. The wife chose the fresh made in house pasta dish of ricotta cappelletti and we both easily cleaned our plates. With reason, we were well fed and skipped dessert on this occasion. The service was attentive and on point with explanations of all the specials and thoughtful with suggestions and questions answered. Customshop will easily become a new regular restaurant in our rotation. Sadly they no longer serve brunch, which they used to in the past. I guess it wasn't popular, too bad.",

We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender who took our drink order and provided us with menus. Here is a rundown of why this is a five star establishment.  Cocktails: yes, yes, yes! The bartender was so friendly and gave us some insight into the drink menu, which rotates seasonally. She seemed extremely tuned into what her customers like and what to change up during the year. We order the Cucumber Basil Smash and the Ginger Devil. They were so delicious that we ordered three more (good thing we were walking home).  Food: We had already ate some dinner, but were hungry for some snacks so we ordered a Charcuterie board and loved it so much that we order another one with a few different cheeses and meats. We also order the Tuna Meatballs which were melt in your mouth fabulous with the texture of a meatball and the freshness of tuna.   We are looking forward to walking back here on a summer night to have more cocktails, sit down for dinner and enjoy some desserts. Bravo Customshop!",

I recommend the fresh cheese/blueberry/honeycomb plate or the meat and cheese plate. We shared both. We also tried the octopus - the guys liked it and said it was not gummy or chewy at all. We had the steak and duck as mains; the steak was better than the duck. We finished with their in house made ice creams and a chocolate souffle. The ice creams were interesting flavor a but delicious. The only thing we didn't like all night was the pb&j ice cream. I'm sure dinner was a fortune but it was a special occasion after all!",

Our server Scott did a fantastic job and listening to his descriptions of the specials made us want to get each one.   The scallops were so good with a fantastic sauce.  The salads had great flavor and many of the veggies come from the chefs personal garden.  Bead pudding for desert and various ice creams had so much flavor. Brussels sprouts were a big hit at the table and a few said \"best ever\".  Gratin potatoes were not heavy with cheese like some.  The cheese plate was possibly the hit of the night.  Many different types with meats and sauces.  Exquisite wine selection with the \"Roth\" a big hit at the table tonight.  If you want a different dining experience that pushes the culinary limits this is a place for you.",

The only downside is that they get just so busy that the service is very inconsistent and therefore mistakes are likely to happen. I won't list all the mistakes made at our last meal like some people because  our dinner was still quite good. My only recommendation is to go early or on a weeknight when they are less crowded and less noisy. Tip, do not order the tuna meatball, it is not good at all.",

    "text": "I finally can say Charlotte has great restaurants!   We came with a group of friends.   Food: 1. Complementary bread with home made garlic butter spread: It's amazing!!!!   2. Small plates: a. Honey Cones: Made from heaven! 3 different types of local honey cones, with cheddar biscuits, blue berries and beets. Great combination and it's definitely something you don't see in any other restaurants!   b. Braised pork belly: crispy outside edges and juicy meat inside. I hate fatty meat, but I like this! Actually, I love this!   c. Brussel Sprouts: I hate Brussel Sprouts in general, but this one is crispy and blends well with the rest plates.   d. Bbq octopus: crunchy ends and thick and tend in the middle. Very flavorful! Very good! This is speaking from a non-octopus fan!   e. Spicy tuna meatballs: I had high hopes for this one, but was actually a little disappointed. Didn't taste too different from regular meatballs. This is probably the only one I won't order again.   3. Entrees: a. Smoke Duck: really good. Doesn't taste gamy, which is what I was worried about. Tastes very smoky! I like the flavor and the sides that come with it. Just a little too rare (ordered medium) for my preference. Everyone else loves it though.   b. Steak: flavor is good! Tasted good! Again, too rare for my liking, but everyone else loves it!   c. Ink Squid bucatini: good!   4. Desert: Bread pudding. Comes in a hot skillet. Rich flavor and tastes a little different than the ones I had in the past, and we all love it (everyone ordered the bread pudding. Two share one order, 3 orders in total)! It's very hearty, so if you want something more refreshing, try something different.   Service: the food came out fast and service is good. Try to come with group of friends so you can order different small plates! Also avoid Saturdays, it's going to be packed. We came on a Sunday night and it was totally worth the wait. Will definitely come here again with more friends!",

    "text": "I really want to rate this 3.5 stars.  It is a good restaurant, but  to me just not knock your socks off good like some of the reviewers think.  I visited here a while back and thought it was OK, but it was restaurant week, so I wanted to try it again.  My husband and I visited before a play uptown on a Friday night.  We had early reservations and were seated promptly.  I had not been since they updated the decor and I really like the look. It is very cozy.  Our waitress was very nice and made a few recommendations for us.  We did not order any cocktails although they sounded good; we stuck with wine.  The bread service is a nice addition.  I wanted to love the food, but I found it to be good not great.  We had:  1-BBQ Octopus- I LOVE good grilled octopus and read several review that it was really good here.  Unfortunately it was WAY too chewy.  I am familiar with the texture, but this was bad as in we needed a steak knife to cut it.  We were not offered one though so took a lot of work cutting it to eat it.  The seasoning on it was really nice, but it was just too chewy to really enjoy.  I was so sad, but guess I'll stick to it at a place like Upstream.  2-Yellow Fin Tuna Crudo- This was yummy!  Very simple dish, although it was swimming in oil.  It could have had a bit less as it spilled all over the table.  Delish though.  3-Scallops-we got the special scallop dish that was on the menu that night.  The scallops were cooked very well and really enjoyed them.  The accompaniment did not quite mesh together and I think the dish that is listed on yelp on the regular menu sounds like it would have been better.  Would get scallops there again, just not this particular special from that night.  4-Brussel sprouts-One of my favorite foods so I always have to try them.  Especially after the rave reviews I saw.  These brussel sprouts were really good and would definitely get them again.  Not life changing like some of the reviewers think.  Try summit room for some of the best I've had in CLT.  Overall, we had a really nice dinner with good service.  Food was good, but not great.  At these prices you want it to be great!  There are so many great restaurants in town, I unfortunately don't think I\"ll be a rush to get back.",

My friend and I both really took our time and savored the flavors of our apps and entrees. The cocktails we started with were nicely made and presented and we enjoyed the transition to a nice wine list with dinner.   You're going to spend some money here. Good for a special date night, occasion, or to spoil yourself. Definitely not the place I am ordering take-out from or would want to afford on a regular basis.

When we dined last night, we had a reservation for 6:30pm and when we got there we were the only people at the restaurant which I thought was awkward. However, by 7pm the place was buzzing so I would recommend getting a later reservation. Our cocktails were good - this is definitely a selling point for this place. Good bread and enjoyed the tuna appetizer (photographed) and the burrata. I got the steak which was just okay. My husband made the mistake of ordering the special-of-the-day and it ended up being $45. I dislike when they tell you the special and not what it costs but I know that isn't uncommon practice. Overall, our bill for two apps, two drinks, and two entrees was $155 which I felt was expensive for a \"meh\" meal. After two times trying this place, I probably will not be back.",

Other than that, listen carefully to the specials your waiter tells you about. There are some winners there that you should take note of.   Our dining experience here was excellent, mostly due to our awesome server who we all pretty much were crushing on in a 90s sitcom kind of way. He was funny, charming and overall, on top of his game.   I went a little bit out of my normal lane and ordered the Squid Ink Linguine alla Chitarra. Didn't really think I could go wrong with squid ink and shellfish, but must not have read through the description carefully enough and to my surprise, came in a red sauce. It was tasty and made sense with the sausage also in there, but pretty much me and everyone at the table were a little surprised. (Looking back at the description, it's not completely clear but I should have asked.)  My friends ordered the scallops and risotto, which I believe was one of the specials. One bite of it gave me food envy, so if it was on the menu I would definitely re-order that again for myself.  Overall, the small plates were a highlight for me, with the BBQ Octopus and Burrata as the two standouts of the night for me. Obviously, there are just enough for a few bites each if shared, however small but mighty definitely applied to both.",

We went on the opening night; and the ambiance, food, drinks, and service were all spectacular!  My friend was encouraging a special drink, and I was looking for a non/low-alcoholic drink that night. The bartender Zoe suggested and offered a sample of this ginger beer, which I did order. She was so sweet!  And our server Jonathan was very accommodating that he recommended amazing starters, entrees, and dessert catered to our cravings we had that night. They were all showstoppers. As a starter, the goat cheese mousse was Divine. As our shared entree, the Lady Edison porkchop was impeccably seasoned and so tender. The pairing of the marinated pears with the porkchop was unexpectedly a savorful surprise! Last but definitely not the least, the chocolate peanut butter tart... WHOA BABY! I even got an extra slice for to-go.  I'm finished rambling. I'm anticipating my return to this restaurant!",

Id first like to brag on the the super sweet hostess who greeted us, I wish I'd gotten her name because she really stood out and made a great first impression. The restaurant was thoughtfully decorated and had a great ambiance, it was welcoming, a tad busy but not loud. We started with burrata di bufala and it was delicious! The bread it was served with was amazing, definitely recommend this dish! The saffron linguini was also a must try. Everything here was spot on from the food, to the atmosphere, and especially the friendly staff. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I really wanted to like Customshop again- it was one of our favorite spots for years, so was optimistic that the rebuild would put things back on track. Unfortunately, our meal missed across the board.   The restaurant ambiance wise is chic inside, but the noise level was absolutely deafening. Our reservation was at 6:30 on a weeknight, so having to yell across a four top to hear anything was unfortunate. The service was mediocre and the bar was backed up throughout the night, but would rather focus on the details of our food:  Bread: A highlight of the meal, could eat 10 plates worth. Great crust with fluffy inside, olive oil and pepper to top it off. Goat cheese mousse: Tasted more like creme cheese; lacking that tart, earthy flavor. Crab and Shrimp Ceviche: Absence of acidity and seasoning made the dish taste noticeably fishy. No chips or bread for scooping. BBQ Octopus w/ Gnocchi: Octopus overcooked and rubbery. Gnocchi was actually quite good but overpowered by the bbq sauce. Lamb Shank w/ Mushroom Risotto: Lamb was tender but desperately needed salt/seasoning. Risotto overcooked like porridge and lack of salt made the sauce sweet not savory. Duck Breast: The chef suggested temperature of medium came out rare (not surprising for duck), but the lack of fat rendering made the strong \"duck\" taste overwhelming. Pork Chop: Delicious, well-balanced flavors. Mustard Anglaise was great, and the fingerlings were nicely cooked.  Tip, tax, and wine included, the bill ran easily within the $$$ range. While I'd like to say otherwise, we won't be returning to Customshop anytime soon.",

    "text": "Customshop provided a nice welcome dinner on my recent visit to Charlotte. Our group of four was seated in a cozy booth, and our server was personable and attentive.   We started with some shared plates: burrata, tuna crudo, octopus. I really liked the burrata. The tuna crudo was pretty but dainty - one small bite per person, plus one remaining bite that everyone was too polite to claim for themselves.   For drinks, I enjoyed the smoky old fashioned followed by several glasses of wine which were recommended by our server. All of the wines were excellent and our server's pairing advice was spot-on!  I was super bummed that the pumpkin ravioli was unavailable but happy to try the scallops and risotto special. It was very good! I also tried the squid ink linguini which was nice, though we were all surprised that it came in a red sauce since that wasn't mentioned in the description. We all shared a side of the fingerling potatoes, and I feel pretty confident that I ate at least half the dish. So good!   One small critique is that the menu is kind of on the small side. I think with a few more options, Customshop could easily be a five star dinner option. Regardless, I'd be happy to return on another visit to Charlotte!",

Hats off to you Customshop, because I will think of you and drool.  I ordered the special, the scallops and risotto. Scallops were light and fluffy, the way they should be, as well as the risotto being a nice creamy texture. Seriously, plate licking should have been involved.  We also ordered a round of apps for the table. The burrata was good, although not as creamy and rich as I remember others being. The squid was good too, but it wasn't impressive like my dish was. This however will not change my view that this is a solid restaurant to visit!   Service was stellar, as our server was super friendly and attentive. He did a good job of suggestions on food and drinks. So good that I left definitely feeling very happily buzzed on some great wine. Whoops!",

    "text": "On an evening where basically every other restaurant was packed full (aka Valentine's Day), Customshop was one of basically no restaurants with reservations left.  Me, being semi-anal about having actual reservations before going anywhere that is going to be packed, plucked the last available spot on OpenTable.    The restaurant itself is conveniently located in Elizabeth (close enough to Uptown) along a street with many other popular restaurants such as Carpe Diem and Passion8.  The lighting is pretty dim, but it matches the atmosphere of the restaurant, which isn't too loud or too quiet, but just right... maybe because the entire restaurant was of couples? We were seated closely to another table, but didn't have to listen to their conversation the whole night.  Our server, Zoe, was an absolutely delight and was super friendly to us the whole evening.  The drinks took a little long to arrive, but it may have been because it was a full house... so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  As for food, we chose to order a bunch of small plates and one main entree: - Tuna crudo - slightly different texture than what I'm used to, but the flavor was okay.  Could have been a bit more tangy - Beef carpaccio - holy moly this was the motherlode of all beef carpaccios.  It's a LOT for two people.   - Razor clams - best flavor of the night, but some of them were a little overcooked and very chewy - Pork belly - could have been a little more melt-in-your-mouth and was rather bland - BBQ octopus - I was a little apprehensive about ordering BBQ anything, but this actually turned out to be the best dish of the evening.  I liked that it had a little kick to it and was more flavorful than the other dishes - Smoked duck - cooked just right... loved the crispy skin.  Overall, the food was a bit lackluster in that many of the dishes simply were not flavorful, salty enough, or just quite bland.  BUT... for dessert, I ordered the brownie souffle with coffee ice cream and that solved all my issues for the night. The souffle was the perfect amount of chocolate - not too rich, and just melty enough.  The cold ice cream and the melty goodness of the souffle complemented each other so well. I ate the entire thing by myself, thanks to my dinner companion that evening, and have zero regrets!  Excellent service and atmosphere, blandish food, but amazing dessert.  Prices were reasonable.",

The ambiance is perfect for close conversation and a swanky vibe in the QC, which we loved a lot! However, our server seemed a tad off and we would go periods at a time where he never would come us. We had to eventually ask another waiter to put in our order. Brussels were good! We also got the butter goat cheese and the crackers were overly salty, not enough bread for the spread provided, and the cheese seemed rather bland. I ordered the scallops for dinner--$32, which were very nicely done, but sadly I left hungry since there were only three, and two small potatoes along side it. This is a spot that is overpriced for a meal that doesn't leave you satisfied. I would pop in for a drink perhaps, but I wouldn't recommend this as a spot of choice for future evenings.",

    "text": "So have been traveling back and forth to charlotte for work lately and while out in the city in February, we decided to go take an early night and grab a bite to eat at a local joint. The options were limited given the last minute booking but customshop was available so we decided to give it a shot. We walked over from the Sheraton (would recommend uber for those in downtown directly). The walk was pleasant from the hotel and we were soon upon the small strip of hip restaurants around. Was able to find this spot quickly for our reservation and were greeted promptly upon entering the joint.   The space itself is a \"long restaurant\" and therefore stretches back. I was pretty excited to see a well stocked bar as I need to have my whiskey neats flowing for any night (don't judge). Our server was an absolute gem (Zoe) and was very friendly the entire time. She was a sweetheart and wish that all of you are lucky enough to have her as your server! After looking through the menu, we decided to order the tuna crudo, beef carpaccio, razor clams, pork belly, bbq octopus, and the smoked duck. The portions for all the dishes were solid but there seemed to be a slight lack of kick to a lot of the flavors leaving it a bit short of what I had expected for each dish. The tuna was OK but I wish there was a bit more tang with either some type of vinaigrette or something else to give it a bit of jazz. The Carpaccio was good but the portion was a bit off putting and it was hard to finish all of the dish. The razor clams were a welcome addition, however some of the clams were cooked better than others leaving a hodge podge experience. The ones that were cooked well were quite delicious while the opposite left a chewy texture. The pork belly was a heaping piece of meat but again there was something missing from kicking some flavor into it. The BBQ octopus was an interesting take and was probably one of my more favorite items despite me not liking octopus that much. The smoked duck was delish and something I would definitely get so was glad to have the two items be a solid contender.  All in all, this place was just OK for me as it relates to food. There is so much potential and the service was phenomenal so hopefully with a menu shift they are able to add some \"jazz\" to the food to kick it up a notch. Prices were reasonable for the food as well which was a nice plus.",

    "text": "I'm debating between a 3 and a 4, so I'm settling on a 3.5 start rating. Customshop has some great things you'll notice before even sitting down to order. It's off the trendy Elizabeth Street, which also boasts food gems like Carpe Diem, Earl's Grocery and Viva Chicken. Customshop is very unique from the others though and has a True rustic, local feel.  They have a small porch outside with some tables and casual sitting chairs and couches. It's a smaller restaurant inside, but there's a beautiful long bar that greets you as you walk in, enticing you for a craft, handmade cocktail, a glass of wine from their lengthy wine list, or a local craft beer. Customshop is all about local ingredients, and sources meat and cheeses from local producers. They also do nightly specials that rotate with the season/day, which is always impressive to me.   Our waitress, Emily, was very attentive throughout the experience. We actually had two more diners join us after ordering appetizers and she was very casual and cool with it, and went with the flow. She was also aware of food allergies and helped us with ordering. I started with the cucumber basil smash cocktail. I actually thought this was a little more watery than it should have been - I was disappointed. It wasn't that pop of refreshment or zip I was looking for, it was kind of flat. So rather than ordering a second cocktail for my next drink, I stuck with a glass of red wine.  As for appetizers, we started with the crispy brussel sprouts with maple syrup, and the braised pork belly. I found the pork belly to be rather dry. The brussel sprouts were very good, and had the perfect amount of crispy skin and they weren't overly saturated in maple syrup. A+ for the brussels, B- for the pork belly. Also, don't miss out on the bread they bring you. It's fabulous. I can't remember the butter it was served with, but it's tasty enough to eat with a spoon on it's own. The bread also has a sweeter hint to it, likely some sort of honey. I am in love with this bread.   We next tried the spicy tuna meatballs and the BBQ octopus. I enjoyed both of these dishes. The tuna meatballs weren't fishy at all. In fact, I wouldn't even have known they were made of tuna if I didn't order them off of the menu. I liked the spice that they were cooked with and it hits you at the end of the bite. If you've never had octopus, it is naturally a bit chewy, so that is to be expected. I think they put some great flavors together for this octopus, and the lemon aioli was an obvious winner in my book.   At this point, I was rather full but I still wanted to try the duck for my main meal. The duck was served with black garlic lentils, compressed apricots in a sherry dressing. I loved the lentils and apricots more than the duck, to be honest. The lentils had such a great flavor profile! The duck was good, don't get me wrong, but I almost feel like it was undershadowed by the lentils. Either way, this is a dish I would definitely order again.   The portions are rather small for the price tag of the dish. I do think the food is overpriced, and I wasn't overly \"wow-ed\" by some of the dishes like I had hoped to have been. However, it's a classy atmosphere, and great for an intimate date night. The service is very good, and it's a great environment for ordering many different appetizers.",

    "text": "Like Molly mentioned earlier, I hadn't even thought to go to Customshop until the Living Social Deal pretty much forced me to buy the coupon and give it a shot!  The place is relatively small, so you should make reservations early if you want a \"normal\" dinner time. 5 days in advance, I was able to reserve a table at 8:30pm. We arrived 30 minutes early (movie got out sooner than expected) and were promptly seated, despite the time discrepancy. The hostess was very nice about it and lessened my awkward feeling about being so early. Fortunately, they do have a small bar in case you're early and a table isn't available. The ambiance of Customshop is wonderful. It's just small enough to feel cozy and the candles throughout bring a warm feeling to an otherwise stark building. It also has this great quality to it where EVERY table was full the night we were there, but it never felt crowded or loud.  They start you off with some delicious, soft bread drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with freshly cracked pepper. I wished the bread was \"crustier\", but all-in-all, it was really good. Our water glasses were always full and the initial pour of wine was quite a pour!  For dinner, I had the pumpkin gnocchi in brown butter and sage and the BF has the scallops on mushrooms and a pumpkin sauce. My gnocchi was incredible. Perfectly cooked and nicely spiced. The sauce was great also. I typically cannot stand seafood; however, the scallops were perfection. Soft and buttery, yet light and creamy. The pumpkin sauce they were atop was also perfect. Nicely seasoned but the flavor of the pumpkin still came through.  Customshop knows what's up. The food is great, the ambiance is fantastic and the service is about as good as it gets.

To those who complain about the service, I suspect that they don't understand what they're ordering, how to not treat servers like servants, and generally act like they're at Olive Garden. Grow up people, this place is great and deserves much higher ratings based on the simple fact that it's not the same old Charlotte old american staples. They serve food you can't get anywhere else in Charlotte and much more like what you might find in San Francisco or NYC.",

    "text": "Somewhere in the sea of restaurants that get lost and inevitably closed in Charlotte you start to lose focus on why the really great ones work- because certainly you have a lot of options- but those are options that you can sort of bounce around to and then never really depend on as a repeat guest- but I think that is what makes Customshop work.. The menu is trendy without being over bearing- it changes but not so much that you lose what you LOVE- you may lose what you like but the niche that is removed is filled accordingly-  most notably the Lamb Cheek was so good I nearly set up a battle line so I could hog it from my date.  Everyone around us talked about the Ribeye Deckle- which was better than even they had portrayed it to be- eventually I had to give in to sharing so we ordered two.. The service was just casual enough- I think of it as sort of Brooklyn-esque- Scott was fantastic and really made it seem like we had met him a dozen times before..  I would recommend asking for him- I couldn't believe how comfortable the whole scene was- as busy as it got he never flinched or harried anything..  The Chef came by the table to make sure the cheeks were good- he was incredibly humble which was nice because I had shamed myself by vaporizing his cooking.. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely return to this restaurant..",

    "text": "We went to Customshop as a birthday dinner -- I found these previous reviews after making reservations, and was concerned, but nonetheless ready, taking into consideration both previous reviewers backgrounds (one an nyc diner, another with a \"culinary\" background) and also very aware of the genuine lack of outstanding dining choices in Charlotte.   I was pleasantly surprised. While yes, the prices are high, I was not offended by a $10 crudo plate or salad. The wine, a Volnay, was delicious, and our crudo plate for one (scallop, tuna and one other) was very good and if I were to be picky, the scallop was a little fishy. We ordered it to get a sense of the restaurant, and I think it was an accurate representation. We also ordered a fig salad with wilted spinach, pine nuts and a blue cheese vinegrette and a calimari plate with a delicious tomato sauce and caper berries. While the spinach salad was uninspired, it was still good. The calimari, however, was very good.  I ordered the squid ink spaghetti with king crab and mint, and my husband ordered duck with cherries. The duck was extremely rare, which my husband enjoyed (it was less appealing to me...) but the squid ink spaghetti was fantastic.  I found the food to be good and our waiter, Jack, was fantastic -- very attentive and ready to offer suggestions when we had a difficult time deciding.  The worst part, by far, was the noise volume. Both my husband and I like loud places, but this restaurant hurt our ears. This is not the place for a romantic dinner, but more for a boisterous party of friends or a place to hop to before going out.",

The food was very good, but our service was poor & detracted from the meal. The hostess did not greet us, make eye contact, or even smile. We gave her our name - we had a reservation - & all she gave us was an indifferent \"follow me, please.\" We were seated & we waited. And waited. It wasn't busy, & there seemed to be plenty of people working. Just as we began to consider going elsewhere, our waiter, Patrick, who had passed us several times without pausing, finally came to our table. My date remarked that we were glad to see him. He said, \"yes, I actually exist.\" He was not well trained. Our drinks were wrong (we both ordered the house Manhattan), & he served our small plates with no serving pieces. It was hard to get water. Rather than clearing my place after we'd eaten the first course, he plopped my main course on the edge of the table. That was it for me: inadequate & sloppy service. We spent over $125 on dinner that night. Again, the food was very good, but I expect some graciousness to go along with an upscale meal. Please, Customshop, invest some time holding your front of house staff to a standard on par with your food.",

    "text": "Really, this should be a 3.5...  I have eaten at Customshop three times.  Once for brunch, and twice for dinner.  I have had two excellent meals, and one that I really have no interest in repeating any time soon.  First, the good.  I have had consistently good service (with one caveat, which I will discuss below).  The service has been attentive without being smothering, and the servers have been very knowledgeable.  I also love the atmosphere.  The lighting and the decor are great - not too dark, but dark enough where it feels very comfortable.  Compared to the horrible atmosphere at Carpe Diem (across the street), Customshop is a real gem.  The drinks (cocktails) I have ordered have also been very good.  They aren't cheap -  they are overpriced as is typical of Charlotte's better restaurants - but I have found them to be creative and very tasty.  (My last trip to Customshop found me at the bar ordering a martini with gin and wine in it.  I was skeptical, but it tasted fantastic.)  The food, for the most part, has been first rate.  For brunch I had their eggs benedict.  Excellent.  For the first dinner we started with their flat bread, and I was impressed by the texture of the crust and the tasty toppings.  I had a boneless short rib for my entree, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was cooked to perfection, and it really melted in my mouth.  We also ordered the brussel sprout side dish, which was excellent.  For dessert, we had the bread pudding.  I love bread pudding, and while I have had better than what they serve at Customshop it hasn't happened often.  I think it is a must order if you like dessert.  My third trip to Customshop produced a much more disappointing outcome.  We ordered crudo and two salads.  I didn't try the crudo, but the judgment from my dining companions was that it was not very good at all.  We also ordered two salads and they were both disappointing.  The butter lettuce and blue cheese was really a bit of a joke for $8.  It is certainly the worst thing that I have had at Customshop.  I can't believe that they are trying to justify charging that much money for several pieces of lettuce, a bit of blue cheese, and a smidge of dressing that wasn't flavorful.  The arugula salad was better, but not worth anything close to $9.  The good news was that we got a great wine recommendation... For our entrees we ordered the ribeye, the short rib, a pasta dish, and I got a pork dish (after asking for a recommendation from the server).  The pork was thinly sliced and breaded, and, well, really not very tasty.  I was terribly disappointed, and I realized that I should have trusted my gut - which told me to ignore the server's recommendation and order the duck instead.  My dining companions seemed very happy with their entrees, so thankfully I was the only one who ordered poorly.  We had bread pudding for dessert, and it lived up to our previous experience.  Three appetizers, two beers, a bottle of wine, a glass of wine, four entrees, and two desserts (plus a bottle of Pellegrino) and with tax and tip the meal was $280 - not a particularly good value in my mind.  I would certainly return to Customshop.  Relative to some of the other \"higher end\" restaurants in the area - Carpe Diem and Fig Tree - I can at least say that I have had good food here.  I don't think Customshop is a great value, though.  If you are looking for great \"bang for the buck\", then I would try a different restaurant.",

The waiter went way beyond the typical aloofness of  waitstaff in better restaurants -- he was downright  rude when he saw that our table was two women only -- neither of whom was drinking.  What he doesn't know is we both have backgrounds in the culinary industry and tip, at the very least, 20% for very poor service and up to 50% for outstanding service.  Needless to say he got 20%.  The crudo was outrageously priced and disappointing.  I got the crudo with \"the mixed pickled veggies\".  The mixed veggies were only scallions -- one of my least favorite foods.  I guess it could be called \"veggies\" (multiple) because there was more than one scallion.  The waiter was less than helpful when I asked about the source of the beef  because Customshop is known for serving some local and organic foods.  The only thing I could find local and organic was the pork and some cheese.  The carpaccio was pretty tasty.  The entrees were so blah I can't even remember what I had.  I will not be going back.",

The space and food quality are reminiscent of a Charleston Maverick restaurant, but more intimate and uniquely Charlotte in the commitment to locally grown fruits, vegetables and meats. Oh, and their WTF meats listed on the menu are actually from Wild Turkey Farms in China Grove, North Carolina, and does not stand for the other WTF you potty mouths were thinking.   The cheese plates are lovely, and servers are well-versed in the choices and wine pairings. Try the Blu di Bufala (Water Buffalo) with local honey and Cremont Double Cream (Cow & Goat) cheeses for a pungent spin on typical cheese board offerings.  There were several entrees that made the main portion of the meal difficult to choose; however, the house made Potato Gnocchi, Lamb Ragu & Merguez Sausage was ridiculously full of savory win. The Braised Beef Boneless Short Rib was gorgeously tender and flavorful, and nicely complemented by the Kale and Marmalade.  Attentive service and intimate upscale digs round off the feel of Customshop, which in its entirety is an experience in which you'll want to paddle around within the lazy river of yum.  Customshop is located at 1601 Elizabeth Avenue in a building that is over 100 years old, and amazingly hasn't been torn down and replaced by a big bank building and filled with men wearing blue button downs, as is the usual Charlottean custom.",

    "text": "In late July 2011, we were desperate for good food as we made the trek from Alabama back home to Washington, DC.  We knew Charlotte's reputation for good restaurants, and after a bit of Internet research, we pulled off the freeway and headed for Customshop.  To say we enjoyed the meal is an understatement.  The restaurant is welcoming, the staff gave great service, and the food was delicious.  We started with a charcuterie plate (rustic pate, rabbit sausage, delicious cheeses), enjoyed delicious entrees (pork, halibut), and sampled a topnotch dessert (bread pudding).  And during the meal, we sipped a wonderful local beer.   Customshop's commitment to local sourcing and careful preparation really pays off.  It's a great place to relax and enjoy yourself.",

    "text": "Having had a handful of dinners here and now (most recently) a stop in for brunch, this intimate restaurant remains near the top of my list for upscale places to visit with foodie friends and out of town guests.  While partially subscribing to the locally-sourced ingredient movement, Customshop gets creative in the kitchen and the result is serious flavor in a very cool atmosphere.  As mentioned in other reviews, the appetizer menu is not to be overlooked.  Specifically, the cheese (and meat) boards are a must do as there are selections here you will not find at even the local specialty grocer.  Each cheese is paid with a honey, marmalade, or other side that complements the pairing.  The board is also served with large crunchy crackers that contrast nicely with the creamy smoothness of most cheeses.  Pair these with a glass a wine from the trim but sufficient wine menu and you may not make it to the main courses- a very happy problem to have.  You can bring your own wine, but there is a corkage fee of $20 per bottle- typical, but a bit disappointing.  The main course menu does vary according to the seasons, but they usually have at least a couple of house-made pastas that deserve your attention.  Squid ink linguni, for example, might first look like tentacles lurching across your bowl, but when paired with a chili pepper-based sauce and rock shrimp with mint you'll trust in your taste buds as you tame that beast with your fork.  Gnocchi based dishes and their pairing were also worthy of attention.  But don't be afraid to venture beyond pasta, as the others mains will tempt you with unexpected but most tempting combinations of flavors- all waging a mini-war for the attention of your taste buds.  Brunch is equally a feast for your eyes as much as for your hunger.  You will find an upscale collection of both traditional breakfast items as well as main dishes for those more on the \"lunch\" side of the equation.  The wife and I both had dishes that utilized poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, which were both expertly executed and decadent when paired together.  Sadly, the small side of home fries seemed bland and uninspired compared to the main dish.  Portions sizes were adequate, and refreshingly not made to fill a buffet-style plate.  Bonus for offering counter culture coffee in a french press.  Bottomless mimosas are also a popular choice.    Love the old yet modern feel of the space- from the booths to the little tables tucked along the wall and cloaked in primarily candlelight after dark.  Even the bar feels rustic yet private, like a speakeasy tucked into a back alley.  Smoothly cool, yet creative and expertly executed- Customshop is a serious gem to be savored.",

We were able to sit outside on the small patio--it was the perfect temperature for males and females alike. Unlike my last trip, our waiter was very friendly and not at all Oscar the Grouch-esque.   The food: let me just say it was one of those meals where everyone was audibly mmm'ing. Not much talking = culinary success.   I loved the complimentary bread, generously drizzled with olive oil and cracked pepper. We ordered a charcuterie plate to start with a selection of meats and cheeses. Notice a trend here?   After ogling a delicious roasted okra concoction at the table beside us (not on the menu) we asked our waiter for one of those as well. It was outstanding, a bit spicy, a lot smoky. Spying can really pay off.   The softshell crab with collards and polenta took home the blue ribbon that night. The crab was so lightly breaded, with a delicate crunch that no crab lover could ever resist. The beef carpaccio appetizer was also a standout. A much larger portion than I had during my Restaurant Week visit.   The same can be said about the brioche bread pudding. Good God this dessert is delicious. Just thinking about it makes me weak in the knees!",

    "text": "After getting a taste of Customshop at a Yelp even last fall we decided to go back for a Valentine's Day special occasion. In both ambiance and cuisine they delivered in spades.  For an appetizer, we split the fried goat cheese balls. The sweetness of the honey complimented the warm richness of the cheese wonderfully. I followed that up with pumpkin gnocchi. The crunchy walnuts and wild mushrooms added texture and the salty perfection of the chucks of blue cheese was the perfect compliment to the tender gnocchi. If I didn't feel so classy in the low-lit, chic space I probably would have licked the bowl. Toss in a choice of two local beers on tap and bread that literally melted in my mouth and you have a dinner that I won't soon forget.  Some of the earlier reviews cited service issues, but I saw no such problems. The hostess was polite and friendly and the server was attentive and engaging while still giving us plenty of privacy to be all gushy between ourselves (it was Valentine's Day after all). Yes, the prices are a bit higher than I would usually seek out, but I an a touch cheap. They are well within reason and the food was definitely worth it. Everything was so fresh and tasty. I used the Open Table feature on the Yelp mobile app to make a reservation and the system appears to work wonderfully.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Customshop to anyone looking to grab a classier bite in Charlotte while steering clear of uptown. I know I'll be back.",

We had a bit of a wait for our table, but I liked that the maitre d' didn't rush the people in front of us. We sat happily at the bar with a couple of drinks and a cheese plate until they finished.  The service was great (exceptional, really) but the food stole the show. My pork shoulder, a temporary Restaurant Week addition, was unbelievable. I am sure that it will be seen again on their fixed menu: there's just no way that they could discard a dish that good. Our waiter was also nice enough to mention that they had added their famous scallops to the prix fixe menu, which made my girlfriend's night.  But I would go back just for the dessert. The chocolate something-or-other was nice, but the bread pudding was the best I've had in Charlotte. It even tops that decadent creation at Dandelion Market. I don't have the words.

    "text": "So, I have to start with the good - the food actually tasted pretty good. I suppose you're thinking, Heather, good tasting food should equal more than 1 star. Well, you'd be wrong, sir.    I have no issues paying higher prices for excellent food but with that I certainly expect a good experience to go along with the price tag. I don't mean to toot my own horn but I'm not a bad home chef so going out to eat is more than just tasty food. I want a relaxing, comfortable, exciting and yes, tasty experience. Only having one of those criteria do not justify a $100 tab.   I made reservations a week ahead of time for a Saturday night. It was for the manperson/meateater's birthday.  I'd heard (and they promote on their website) that they have a chef who formerly worked in a vegetarian kitchen and would cater to special diets. Word up! I mentioned to the hostess I'm vegan and she said she'd make a note of it under our reservations.   We arrived about 10 minutes ahead of our reservation time. Of course I expected it to be busy but there is NO waiting room. Well, there is room to stand but it is awkward and you're constantly shifting about to make room for people to enter/leave. They do have an outside area which I assume is nice in the spring or fall but not when it's 30 degrees outside. I told the hostess our name and she said it would be no problem, it would be a few minutes for our table. Whatevs, no biggie. Wait, no biggie until people came in AFTER us with NO reservations and are sat ahead of us. I don't know if she was confused, had marked a specific table for us or what but that is not ok.   Anyway, the wait wasn't terribly long and we made our way to a 2-top that was painfully close to another 2-top. It's a small room; I understand they have to make room for as many tables as possible. It took about 10 minutes before we got a drink order, another 10 for drinks to arrive. Server completely lacked any personality and seemed annoyed to be there. Honestly, they seemed short-staffed and I know that's frustrating but cheer up pup, you still have to pretend to be happy to serve us dinner.  I told him I was vegan , \"no problem\". Then I said my dining partner was going to do a salad and main dish, could the chef also do a salad and main for me . Silly me, I assumed he was listening. About 20 minutes later manperson's salad arrived, nothing for me. We didn't see our server for another 10 minutes or so and I just gave up at this point. We had to flag someone else over to get water and a replacement fork for one dropped on the floor. Entrees arrived. He ordered a ribeye with blue cheese and they brought me (I kid you not) a plate of random veggies in a tomato sauce. No grain. No protein. Essentially a side dish of about 3/4cup of veggies that they charged $17 for. Give.Me.A.Break. This is what a place that yaks about their vegetarian chef comes up with? Pathetic.   We'll wrap this up now as I'm getting irritated with the whole experience almost a week later but in summary - overpriced, pretentious, crap service. Spend your money elsewhere.",

That being said, the last two times I've been there I've made poor choices in ordering.  I would recommend steering away from the crispy duck breast any entree specials that include veal.  The duck breast was anything but crispy.  Try a half inch layer of fat.  And the last time we went the waitress raved about the veal special they were having.  My boyfriend and I being regulars to the Custom Shop and knowing their typical portions, both ordered the veal plate.  Let me tell you, this thing was offensive.  It came out looking like a pizza pie.  Pounded veal, wrapped in prosciutto over a \"bed of greens\".  Thinking about it now makes me a little queasy.  We both felt sick for the next 24 hours after only finishing half of our plates.   Greasy, heavy, flavorless and in general very unappetizing.  Now, the veal episode aside... the Custom Shop usually never disappoints.  Their scallop dish is to die for and their beef carpacchio with fresh ground horse radish is my favorite in the world.  This place has the ambiance of New York City with an industrial building feel coming through.  The wait staff is always knowledgeable and friendly - really making it their goal to make sure you have a good experience.   Overall we really do love this place and I'm sure you will too!",

We had a bad experience that was more of the waiter's fault than the restaurant. Waiter broke a wine glass and it went in a dish and on a few plates. They replaced the entree 15 minutes later but too late to enjoy the food with the group. Waiter never apologized and made a joke about the $30 wine glasses don't last long.

Having not checked out the menu before we went in, we discovered the pricing to be a bit on the high end, though all the food and dishes are made via Slow food and local fare, we sat there wondering if droping close to $80 on food and drinks made sense?  So instead we opted for small plate items and side dishes and in the end we were full, had some nice cheese, meats, and side dishes along with the mussels all for a lot less than the $26+ entrees they have on their menu.  Server wasn't sure what to do with us when we ordered that way, but in the end came around and did a good job waiting on us.  Nice place, lovely space, great food.",

    "text": "My second time eating here, it was --- literally --- the best meal of my life. Not necessarily the best entree or appetizer or dessert I've ever eaten, but as a whole, this meal kicked all the others' asses! I'll just list what we ordered and if you have similar tastes, you will understand.  We asked Chip, our waiter extraordinaire, to recommend a bottle of red under $40.  He chose a Super Tuscan and it was delicious.  Perfect for the meat and cheese plate we ordered next.  We started with the meat & cheese plate. We chose 3. - A hot sopprasatta from North Carolina. - A French blue (cheese).  Very blue, very rich & creamy texture. Served  with dried, whole figs. Delicious. Perfect pairing. Chip described it as \"exactly what you'd expect from a high quality French blue\". Spot on. - A smoked sheep's milk from Spain. Also exactly what you'd expect. Very good.  Served with roasted tomatoes.  Then we had a watercress salad with roasted beets, crushed pistachios and a ricotta salata vinaigrette, which was very, very light. But perfect!  For the mains: - I ordered the pumpkin gnocchi, topped with a full POUND of lobster (!!!), oyster mushrooms, in a tomato sauce. (Check the menu for a better description, but it was divine.)  All of their pastas are made in-house, too. Oh, and it was priced at $25, which is totally reasonable for a dish that includes a pound of lobster (and homemade pasta)! - My partner ordered the braised boneless short rib with tuscan kale & cipollini marmalade & loved it. His only complaint was that the portion of meat was perhaps too much relative to the kale. Some might find this a plus!  And to finish the meal off, we ordered the chocolate souffle. DIVINE. This is my favorite dessert, so maybe I'm biased, but they nailed it.  Perfect darkness of chocolate (if that's what you'd call it...) --- not too sweet, not too bitter.  Served with vanilla icecream.  I will DEFINITELY be going back, and will always request Chip, if he's working. He was the perfect waiter.",

We selected several cheese and charcuteries and begin with malbacs and smooth  bordeaux (a must try)!  We shared the duck breast. I read reviews about it being cooked in a variety of ways and my date was kind enough to ask for recommendations, per the chef that evening. We requested it med. well and it was more undercooked.

It kind of reminds me of a restaurant you'd find in NYC's lower east side. We started with a red Cotes du Rhone and a charcuterie of chicken liver pate, fromage and prosciutto. YUM! Second course was a medium rare duck breast for me and a medium rate pork chop for him. Seriously, some of the best duck I have ever had and his pork chop was HUGE. You will want to order a side dish, as the entrees don't have much on the plate except the protein. We ordered fingerling potatoes and they were cooked perfectly. The service was on point and the waiter had lots of nice suggestions. Good place for a ladies night or date night. Great wine and cocktail selection. Wouldn't necessarily bring a small child here, but I don't think anyone would mind if you did, as long as he/she sat quietly and was willing to eat pate ;)",

The flavors were Moroccan--which I liked--but the dish didn't wow me. It was too saucy and there were several pieces of fatty meat in the dish that really turned me off.  My hubby had the rabbit.

While we've had a full meal here, I think they shine with their appetizers and wine selections. Their meat and cheese boards as well as their crudo, are fantastic. If you're a Kobe beef fan, their carpaccio is very good, too. The menu items are definitely not cheap, but I'm ok with that because of their local focus and quality.  I know that they update their menu with seasonal (and usually local) offerings and each app has been delicious. Definitely ask your server or bartender about wine and cheese/meat pairings. The servers are certainly educated and each one has been very friendly. Their bartenders are also very talented - I had the most amazing Blood Orange martini that the bartender made off the cuff.   Inside Customshop is, as Veronica O. says, a great dark bistro. It's definitely got some mood lighting, dark wood booths and a plethora of candles. Romantico!   On a few side notes, I've also been there for brunch and I wasn't overly impressed. I had their brioche french toast with marscapone and it was lacking in the marscapone department. Major bummer for a cheese and sweet lover like myself.   Also, I think this restaurant was really hurting the past year due to all of the construction on Elizabeth Ave. - now that the trolley work is done, I'm really hoping they pick back up. I'll definitely head back over to Customshop for a martini and a big slab of proscuitto and cheese.",

She seemed to be the the only one on, (besides a male filling waters and seating guests) & even though she had so many tables, the moment she came to ours it was as if the rest of the guests didn't exist & she was under no stress whatsoever. kudos to her.   When you sit down they serve you scones w/butter & honestly I could have just eaten a plate of those for breakfast & been content, but then I would have missed out on my rancheros. Poached eggs on pancakes with beans and salsa and oh my goodness. My friend had an egg white omelet & both of ours were cooked perfectly, I don't think I've ever been served such egg perfection.   I did notice that their brunch menu was very heavily accessorized with hollandaise. Not that it isn't an item you can't request to be left out, or that it is necessarily a bad thing, it just seemed odd to me. But go, and enjoy!",

    "text": "I've been to Customshop 3 times now and I wanted to make sure my first experiences were not an anomaly before I posted. This is hands down one of the top restaurants in Charlotte and one of only a few that I consider a True \"foodie\" spot.   Lets start with the atmosphere since that is what we see first... very cozy with a speakeasy kind of vibe. Small enough to feel like you're part of an insider crowd, but not too small that you're eating on top of the table next to you.  Next up, menu and wine list... here is where Customshop really shines. They are not afraid to get creative with their dishes - not total mainstream like many other places in CLT, but also not over the top eclectic that you have to pick and just go on blind faith that what comes out on the plate will be enjoyable. Best of all, they have a wine list that matches the menu and atmosphere - go figure, one place in town actually tries to harmonize the main ingredients of a restaurant! Again, not a complete geeky wine list that makes you feel intimidated, but not the usual Harris Teeter selection at 3x the grocery store price.  Last, and most important, the food and service. All 3 times I've had great service - no empty glasses, long waits or issues with the orders. The food has always been great, with individual dishes ranging from my personal bests in CLT to at very least way above average. Oh, and the bread pudding is sick! In a good way, like you eat so much of it because its that good and you get sick when your body stops receiving that goodness.  Long review, I know, but in a town that really lacks good restaurants that can put it all together - atmosphere, harmony between the menu and wine list, and great service, Customshop stands out. At least in my book.",

    "text": "I don't like to be the guy who goes into a place one time and leaves a negative review.  If I have a bad experience I typically hold off reviewing and give the place another chance.  I didn't even get past the hostess stand at Customshop and I'm not sure that I will ever be back to try again.    We've been talking about giving Customshop a try for a while now and decided last week to go for dinner while we were in the area.  Considering that it was 7:30 on a Friday and we had no reservation, our hopes weren't high that we'd get a seat, but it never hurts to try.  As expected, there were no available tables.  No big deal.  Like I said, it was expected.    Here's the problem:  don't talk about what you can't do for me  right in front of me.  Step away from the hostess stand, study your table map, confer with each other, pretend that you're trying to find a table for me--you know me, the guy who pays your salary?--pretend that you actually care.  Instead, a scowling and apparently harried waiter shot down every idea that the two slightly more--though not completely--helpful hostesses presented him with.  Poor form, indeed.  If this is the type of servers that are hired to work here, I'm glad that I didn't have to endure it for an entire meal.    What restaurant managers and owners need to understand is that uniqueness does not reign in Charlotte.  Chances are quite high that another restaurant 2 blocks away is serving the same type food in the same type atmosphere.  You've got to pull me in with service.",

Definitely a good pick. I really like this menu because they have many, many items that are ideal for various definitions of \"clean eating\". Lots of locally raised meats and interesting combinations of veggies, and an emphasis on veggies as sides rather than bread and starch. I like also that they have a lot of small plates in case you're not as hungry, or just indecisive. The service is great, the coffee is excellent.",

    "text": "Oh Customshop. I really wanted to love you. I have been hearing incredible things from my sister for awhile now and last night I finally had the opportunity to try it out. I would like to start by saying that I immediately liked the atmosphere and decor upon entering. We told the hostess we did not have reservations and she said it was no problem, they had a cancellation and could seat us right away.  Once seated we were immediately greeted by our  friendly server and ordered two dirty vodka martinis. Unfortunately  things kind of went down hill from there.  Our martinis were not dirty as we had ordered them, but we were ok with that and drank them anyway. We ordered a cheese plate and beef carpaccio to start. The cheese plate was only so-so and we actually never received our Carpaccio. We would have said something, but we didn't see our server again for quite awhile (it was extremely busy) and at the point that we did, our entrees had arrived, so we figured it wasn't worth it.  Our entrees were ok. Not anything memorable. The ricotta gnocchi was clearly made fresh but the sauce was extremely bland. While eating, we heard the table next to us say something to the server about their gnocchi dish. The server returned to their table with the bowl of gnocchi and told the table that the chef said it was supposed to be that way. ??  That really rubbed me the wrong ways. People pay good money to go out to eat and expect to enjoy their food. This man was in no way being unreasonable or making a fuss. He just didn't think his food tasted good. You would think the chef would want to make this right? Hmm...  Overall, I think there is potential for this place to be great! It seems like so many people have awesome experiences here and perhaps we just caught them on an off night. I would definitely give it another chance. I'll update my review when I do.",

Service is fantastic and knowledgeable about the wine, the beer - everything.  They won't have a beer menu because they cycle craft beers through regularly.    Don't ask for an average beer here.  What they have is much better, free your mind!!!  We had the charcuterie platter - you can pick a few meats and cheeses from several options.  Served on a great platter with flair - they also plunk on complimenting chutneys or caramelized onions.  Yum!  I had the scallops for dinner - perfectly cooked served with squash and mushrooms.  Sooooo good!!  This is just a great place for a date night - highly recommend.    P.S. If anyone from Customshop reads this - could you pretty please turn the heat on in the winter?!?!  I was a frozen Chick-cicle!!!",

    "text": "I hate to do this.  I love the idea of this place, but wow did I get the wrong end of the deal.  My long dissertation here has been sent to management and they are assuring me that the problems will be resolved.  I wish this letter was to inform you of what a great experience it was, but regrettably it isn't. I've had better service from Mad Marge at Waffle house and most of the meals I've eaten at Applebees were much better.  We came in on the day after a holiday to a pretty much empty restaurant. The hostess seated us immediately, but next to the only other people in the place, which was a group of loud old ladies. We were a having a business meeting, but didn't mention anything since they were obviously about to leave.  Next we were greeted by our waiter(Tim G), we looked rather casual, so he acted casual which is fine to a certain extent. When my business partner ordered a bottle of prosseco our waiter intruded you know thats sweet sweet champagne right? In a somewhat condescending voice. I felt no need to correct him and say it was just an Italian white sparkling that is normally drank before the main meal. As we waited for our bottle, we drank our just recently for the first time filled water. Once the bottle was finally brought I ordered some charcuterie and cheese. With 2 people to a table late in the eve the bottle was still put on a table away from us.  We drank our first glass quickly, but it was a good 5-10mins+ and many walks by by our waiter, before I decided to just stand up and grab the bottle and pour some drinks ourselves. This entire time we still had no more water and not our first bread. Once he finally showed back up to take our orders he asked if it was ok to put a bottle in reaching distance of 2 people in a booth. This is where things started to get much worse.  I then asked about what type Oyster mushroom was used in the saffron fettucini. He said that he didn't understand what I was saying. I repeated myself, and he stated that my question didn't make any sense. I repeated myself one more time and he stated that there was only one type of oyster mushroom in yet again a condescending voice. I was under the assumption that the customer was always right when ordered, especially when he was actually right. I was also under the assumption that your facility had some knowledge of mushrooms. I felt no need to teach a taxonomy lesson, but I did briefly explain that there are blue, phoenix, golden, tarragon, etc... mushrooms. My fungi knowledge is vast, I guess I should expect the same of others.  He never offered to ask the chef, as he \"knew\" he was right.  After that encounter I just ordered the whole fish(most expensive entree?) after I asked about it and found out it was close to a \"red snapper\". When I was told there was only one left, I had no idea that that meant it wasn't really even servable but if you wanted to order it, we charge you for it. My cohort ordered the potato gnocci with the lamb ragu.  Our charcuterie finally came. The \"hot\" chorizo, was neither temperature hot or spicy hot, so I have no idea what your intentions were. It was small shriveled up little pieces with not much distinctive flavor. My Prosciutto di Parma was not what it was supposed to be but was something like a salami. Ironically, I liked it, it was thick and the pepper chucks were a little much, but still had good flavor. The Parmesean was good, but I'm not sure if it should be automatically served with honey. The salt/sweet vibe worked, but would have worked fine with our \"sweet, sweet champagne\".  We didn't talk to our waiter for a while after that. It was still well before 10 and him and the apparently only other waitress on duty were too bust closing down for the eve. When he did finally show up with our plates the presentation was pathetic. So it was obviously not just an off night on the wait staff. My whole fish was a little burnt in the face and covered with greens, very interesting way to present(I have pictures). My buddies dish looked edible but at first bite I could tell he wasn't happy. He was paying for the bill so I was trying to play it up and enjoy myself the entire time, but as soon as I dug into the fish, the reality set in. This fish was nasty. Burnt on the head, not even a chunck of cheek left. The middle was chewy and of a strange texture. The lemon jam was pungent, but other than that not usable.  We obviously didn't like our food but felt no reason to complain, if anything we shouldn't have had to, we deserved an apology, but I assume no person that had financial interest in the place was working that day. The waiter did take time from his cleaning job to ask his last table if they wanted dessert, by this point we just wanted out of here quickly. We discussed another bottle but got one else where. The bill came and we were overcharged, it was only a buck or 2 so, we let that go as well.  Paid/tipped and walked out pretty pissed off I must say.  I'll try it again at some point.",

My 3 star review is based around our experience with our reservation.  I made reservations for 8pm and we arrived right on time to a table that was not yet ready.  Okay, not a huge deal we'll just grab drinks at the bar - which we did.  Once the guests at 'our' table received their check and cleared out we were seated (about 20-25 min after the start of our reservation).  The issue arose when we were leaving the bar to sit at our table.  Typically, from my experience, when you delay your customers the drinks or whatever is ordered at the bar (within reason - we only had one drink each) when customers are killing time to wait on their reservation is covered by the establishment.  Not only did I have to pay an extra half an hour of babysitting, I also had to pay for my drinks.  Overall the experience at Customshop was a good one, but I believe that they could have handled the situation a little better.  It's not the restaurant's fault that the guests ahead of us took longer than expected but at the same time the inconvenience should not have been passed along to my wife and I.",
