    "text": "This was honestly the worst \"Italian\" food I've ever had and that includes having dined at various other Sbarro locations. I hit up this location as I was en route to New York and it was the most convenient option and well-trafficked by other diners so I thought \"what the heck?\". I ordered a Sausage & Mozz stromboli because 1.) I was starving 2.) it just needed to be heated up and wouldn't take long to be ready and 3.) it was a nice compromise in size since one slice of pizza may not have been enough and two probably would have been too much.  The stromboli was brought out of the oven looking appetizing enough and sufficiently heated up. That was the best part of my experience. The bottom of it was as hard as a plank of wood and when I tried to cut into with a plastic knife, I was unsuccessful. Even if I had used actual silverware, I would have faced a challenge. I tore it with my hands because I wanted to be able to more easily dip it in the marinara sauce that I got.  The inside was a little mushy, as if the dough hadn't properly cooked. The sausage had zero flavor and they seemed to want to compensate by just piling on more cheese...which was similarly tasteless.   The marinara sauce that accompanied it was watery and it, too, lacked flavor. Heck, even the sodas that were in the fridge were barely cooler than room temperature so I couldn't even get satisfaction from my Coca Cola.  I really don't like to slam a place but I also don't like to mislead others with my reviews either. I hope they evaluate this location and make some big changes immediately. Luckily, they are inside CLT airport and, thus, benefit from constant traffic and visited by people whom they don't expect to be regulars. I'm sure others, like me, come here due to brand recognition and the convenience of its location. I'd be curious as to how many people who have eaten here would come back if given the chance.",

Anyways, I'm not big on employee interaction, but the people here at this location have got to be the rudest people ever.  Not only did the server seem like she was miserable and hated her job and totally ignored the customers trying to place an order in line as she's daydreaming, but the cashier was equally as rude. Maybe they're both having a bad day but I totally felt awkward as they gave me dirty looks and acted as if it was a burden to take care of their customers even as I smiled and tried to make the most of this interaction. LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE!!",

Look at the floors.....ouch!!  This unit is a blip in the system, but hopefully they'll read this!  Zero staff interaction with customers, only themselves...restaurant was filthy and food was cold.",

It's not just like that in airports, I've been to other locations outside of airports and it's the same way. Their Pizza is pretty good, their breadsticks lacked any flavor, I can't say anything about their pastas. The salad was pretty good. They are really good at getting you in and out fast for the most part. I've eaten at this location multiple times when flying through and the food is consistently pretty good. Not great, just good. But then again what airport food is delicious?",

Wrong. Oh so wrong.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, a Greek salad and a soft drink. Pricey but whatever, I'm in the airport. What I wasn't expecting is how awful the food was. My salad was full of limp lettuce and quite a few pieces were browning pretty badly. My pizza was tasteless and nondescript. It would be nice if they tried to keep the place a little cleaner - the place wasn't even packed so it wouldn't have been hard.  Best part of my meal? The root beer.",

Definitely didn't feel as if I was eating in a sanitized environment.  I can understand if they were busy then had would have some excuse.

I've tried a handful over the visits and every time everything has been delicious.  There are several tables, chairs and a couple of hightops to sit at, and there is always seating available.  The pricing is a bit excessive, though the food is good, it's always efficient so I guess worth it.  Most of the staff are friendly and polite, though you sometimes get the odd one that doesn't want to be there.  That said, overall always a good experience and a great spot to grab a quick bite.

Plus this place doesnt put as much of a hurting on the wallet for a slice of pep pizza.  Again, can i fiind better pizza?

The trash cans were overflowing, the lady that was handing my slice of pizza felt like she had to be the world manager and telling me to take my headphones out before I can ask her to give me a slice of pepperoni. I didn't take my headphones out of my ear and I still was able to order a couple slices of pizza and she was still able to give them to me, so not sure what she was trying to do there. Once I did get my stuffed pizza slice it was amazing, that pepperoni slice that I got was actually underwhelming so that was a little more frustrating for me, I should've just gotten another stuffed pizza slice, had I known. I know that they are busy but if you're waiting for the people to come around and change out your trashcan, you may have to do it yourself and do the trashcan drag just to keep your lobby from over flowing.

    "text": "Pizza was fine.  The services were odd.  Woman put two slices of greasy pizza on top if each in a single box, couldn't close it when she tried, handed it to me.  Others were getting separate boxes.  Closed. The cashier said something I didn't hear clearly, repeated it with a tone.  I then realized they are just pushing their hump through the day. Not there for customer service so much.  I detected an attitude. The other workers actually looked fine in action.  Guess I got the two loafs in the team.   Need to groom them with a customer service class.",

    "text": "The pizza is extremely greasy. It literally soaked through the cardboard box and left a grease outline on the table. Good thing the table was already dirty when I sat down! Most of the cheese slid off (probably because of the grease) with my first bite. The crust tasted like cardboard - it was just a nasty slice of pizza. The trash cans were overflowing, the floor was filthy, gross all around!",
