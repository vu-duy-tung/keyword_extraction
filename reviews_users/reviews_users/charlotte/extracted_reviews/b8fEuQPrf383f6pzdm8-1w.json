I couldn't finish my taco salad, pretty salty. But the tacos were good.",

I recommend it for a good lunch, and I suggest sitting outside if the weather is pleasant.",

I ordered the fajitas at $15.99 I barely got a teaspoon of guacamole, or Pico. I got about 3 tbls of cold black beans and some of the rice tht I don't like. They mix the chicken, onions, and peppers with mushrooms!? Way to stretch the main part of the meal. This was my first-time having mushrooms in any Mexican dish and was quite alarmed. It's sort of like ordering a grilled cheese that comes with bacon on it. Not NECESSARY. This was my last attempt with Vida.",

They had Coronas and Coronaritas on special but I opted for a Blood Orange Margarita because I love blood orange - it was great!  The salsa was really good and they will refill it whenever. I chose to get the Tortilla Pie even though I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It was delicious! Filled with mushrooms, chicken, spinach, and a great tomatillo cream sauce. I also liked the cheese on top. Great that you can choose two sides instead of the typical rice and beans. The grilled corn was yummy!  Also I must say our service was awesome. Our server was super friendly and attentive and gave great advice.  Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "I have come here a couple of times, and each time I leave asking \"WHY\"!  Here are the deets... My friends and I went on a Friday night, the place wasn't packed which was nice. We really wanted to sit out in the patio but it seemed too windy, however, it looks like they have great outdoor space.  We got sat right away, they served us chips in salsa, bad idea since we ate two containers of them. The chips where very tasty and warm, the salsa was also pretty good.   We ordered guacamole and drinks - red wine Sangria and a Millionaire Margarita. The guac was bland, no salt, no flavor, the avocado tasted like it can from a container and not fresh at all. The drinks came but immediately we realized that they weren't good, they were too sweet, so sweet we couldn't drink them.   The food was decent, we ordered the carne asada tacos, the tortillas smelled amazing and tasted just as good. We also ordered the garlic shrimp with corn and plantains, the plantains where perfectly cook. I ordered the Vida house salad, it said mixed greens but it was iceberg lettuce (which I dislike), other then that it was meh, nothing special.   What really did it for me is the price, I don't mind spending $100 for dinner for 3 people but I would like the quality food to match the cost, I did not feel it did.   The one constant thing is the service, they are pretty attentive, cleaned up quickly and I never noticed my water glass empty.   I won't say I will never try them again but It will take some time and some convincing from my friend that LOVES mexican.",

I also had a chicken burrito that was fairly good. It was way too big though and very doughy.   Overall is was a good experience. The restaurant is more so a place to go for the atmosphere.

Hey look, there's the Epicenter.   Passed by but took notes on Vida to look for the entrance to Enso Sushi Lounge or whatever it's called. We saw that it was to upscale for our toned down casual attire seeing as they had a rope and security guard at the front. Guess this sushi is served on naked women or something. LOL   Erase Enso. Saw Whiskey River, sounded like a good restaurant. Low and behold its a damn club. Looked around and EVERY BUSINESS IN THE EPICENTER TURNED INTO A CLUB! Cover charge to enter boring ass Wild Wing Cafe? Cover charge to enter a regular ass bar? Cover charge for Walgreen's and Kinko's?  Get tha fuck outta here(insert gtfoh meme here)!!  It's almost midnight. Hurry up... club, bar, turn up in Walgreen's or go home? Wait Vida was still open. Guess we'll settle for that.   Very friendly greeting, chips&salsa better than Chili's! Excellent and attentive staff(shout out to AURIEL D.) that corrected a kitchen mistake before we even noticed it. I had the combo #2. The fish taco was good, the shrimp and crab enchilada was MAGNIFICENT!  They have over 100 different tequilas according to their menu. I had one of their exclusive drinks that had a Brazilian tequila in it which was really good. Like most of you, we ate before we thought about a Yic (yelp pic). So I took a pic of a piece of their bathroom wall art.   I highly recommend if you want to go to a restaurant without a weekend cover charge at the Epicenter!!!",

The service was spot on and I had high hopes but after receiving my 'lump' crab nachos my whole attitude changed.  There were 8 pieces of individual nachos buried in cheese and little else.......hmmm $12 bucks for 8 pieces of baked cheese nachos?  I gave it a try and all I tasted was cheese and grease...no black beans, no crab....cheese.  I thought perhaps they had given me the wrong order so I peeled back a glob of cheese from one of the 8 pieces in search of 'lump' crab to find little bits of crab.  Ok, my bad.......that's what I get for going against my better judgment so I took a L on this one as I had promised myself not to bother with this place......",

Our server was very attentive from the beginning and throughout the meal. The chips were good and the salsa, which had a smoky chipotle flavored twist, was great. We had 4 people in our party, so we ordered a classic margarita, a partita, Vida's specialty frozen margarita and the Skinny margarita. We all decided that the Skinny was best. Do not miss the ripe plantain and black bean mash side! Awesome. Also good, the grilled vegetable tacos and the green chili rice.   We'll be back and will recommend Vida to others. Be sure to make a reservation and be prepared to spend some time there, the food is slow to come out, but I don't think that's a bad thing.",

They have a great menu, but if you're there for the $2 tacos they'll give you a separate menu, kinda like a notepad. One has the option of selecting various sides and toppings on his/her taco. This ranges from beans and rice to spicy tangy cream cheese. Whatever you select, I assure you it will be delicious!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I was thoroughly let down with Vida.  I had high expectations going in and I just don't think an \"American\" Mexican restaurant can cut it.  I'm way fonder of the various chain Mexican restaurants in the area.  I first attempted to come here this past Saturday around 9:00 PM.  Walking up the place looked really nice and the patio only had about two tables seated.  There was a bouncer with a rope, before the door, at the base of the steps that asked if we had reservations.  I didn't, he says there is about a 35 minute wait.  I'm thinking, ok how is the patio empty and the place still has a wait?  Needless to say they did not get my business that night.  I came in on the following Tuesday night, the place was fairly empty and luckily no bouncer waiting to tell us about a fictitious wait time.  I came to watch football with some friends, I know its not really a spot to do that, but the bar is ok and had a couple decent sized TV's.  Service was pretty good, I'm guessing on account of being very slow and empty.  Talk about over priced drinks!  $9 for a shot of vodka, get real.  Its not a night club.  Food, my lord, how can a place attempting to be a high line Mexican joint be so bleh.  Plain, no flavor, PLAIN PLAIN PLAIN!  I ordered the shrimp tacos, a friend of mine ordered fish tacos.  We exchanged one taco each to try them.  The fish supposedly came with a chipotle sauce, didn't taste it.  The shrimp tasted like run of the mill shrimp.  If you ask for the grilled corn with queso, dont get the queso.  No flavor, kind of gross actually.  Corn was not sweet at all either, don't even know how to describe it.  Guacamole dip was actually pretty good just as everyone says, but the chips are way WAY over salted.  All in all I did come in with high expectations.  I expected great Mexican food and Vida just did not deliver.  I'll stick with the trailers sitting on corners for good Mexican food!",

Needless to say we were disappointed in our choice, and will never go back. The food was subpar. Guacamole had no flavor at all. So bad we felt the need to send it back. Sangria was so-so at best (and way overpriced- pay attention to the less visible writing on the signs, a pitcher is NOT $20 if you're not there on Thursday. Dinner was filling, or maybe I just lost my appetite. To add to my personal frustration, the service was just terrible. Our server was slow and difficult to track down when he was needed. When our food was brought out, our server and another guy put all the food down at once... The food runner's arm went right into my burrito. Acceptable? I didn't think so, but they felt it was. He actually tried to leave the table without saying a word (despite the cheese running down his arm). Our servers response to an arm in my food? \"Oh, is that okay?\" No, it's not. And you couldn't pay me enough to come back. I can promise you'd get better Mexican/tex-mex at any of the other places in and around the city.",

We ordered the guacamole, which was not the best I have had, but was pretty decent. We also had margaritas, which were nothing to write home about. My main course, the shrimp and crab enchiladas with a side of roasted corn and plantain/black bean mash, was delicious!   Had it only been for the food, I would probably rate Vida 3 or 4 stars. However, the service was horrible! The food took FOREVER to arrive. The chips and salsa took about 15 minutes after the server finally told us they were being brought out. The guacamole, which we ordered at the same time, took another 20 minutes or so to arrive. Drinks for some reason took at least 10 or 15 minutes to come out. The waitress made comments about our wait time but never once apologized or tried to offer something to make it better. She blamed it on the restaurant being new. \"We've only been open for 2 weeks so things are a little backed up.\" Regardless of who's fault it was. hers or the kitchen's, she didn't try to rectify the situation. Even when getting the check, we asked for two separate checks and because the manager took $2 off 4 out of our 5 drinks, it took her three times to get our check divided correctly (food on one, drinks on the other should not be that difficult!)  All in all, decent-good food, bad service. Hopefully the other servers are better!",

I agree with most everyone else that said that it was the best thing on the menu.  That should be sign enough to stay away, the best thing they make is something that isn't cooked and is put together table-side.  We also ordered the queso fundido as an app...it came out as pretty much a block of cheese that we had to cut into pieces and put on our flour tortillas.  The baking just made it into a globby mess.  I had the carnitas tacos which were flavorless.  I don't recall what everyone else had, but I do remember that all of us left disappointed.

It was 6:30 on Sat night and surprisingly we were immediately seated. We opted for a high top in the bar area. We started with Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole. The Guac was very good. I liked how they put chopped tomatoes on top of it, and it was just the right spiciness. Then we decided to split the grilled salmon, grilled corn, and fried plantains. This was very good eats. Excellent flavor and not an overwhelming amount of food. Did I mention we split it? Some mexican places tend to give you so much food you can't eat it all, this portion size was pretty reasonable. By splitting, we ended up with a lite meal for both of us. The Margarita's were good as well, we stepped up one notch from the house version. Although, they weren't very strong. I like my Margrita's to pack and punch and these were definitely on the not strong side. It was a nice date night experience, as we prepared for a show at the Blumenthal Theater.  The only downside was the cost. It ended up being a pretty pricey meal considering we only had 1 entree, but the 5 Margrita's was a bill breaker. So, great place, good food, be prepared to pay up.",

    "text": "\"Mexican\" and \"Brunch\". Two words that typically don't go together in my mind. But we saw that they had a brunch menu and thought to give it a try.  We looked at the menu online so we'd know what to have. Unfortunately, the menu we had on this particular day didn't have the \"Mexican Toast\" so we had one order of the \"Smoked Salmon Tacos\" and one of the \"Carne Asada and Eggs\". The tacos were excellent - they had the right amount of salmon and a really good load of eggs and cheese. I especially enjoyed the steak and eggs. It was cooked well, the eggs were poached perfectly.  Parking is an irritant. If you're already in Uptown, hey, great. If not, expect to either drive around the block (yes, even on Sunday) or pay for a garage.",

    "text": "Over the last several years, we have seen a rise in quality taco establishments. Both places that keep to authentic Mexican style and new, innovative places that develop their own unique brand of street-style taco. This is neither!  It is as if the creator of this menu went to the local GFS and found whatever frozen or prepackaged ingredients that were on sale and lamely attempted to cobble together a menu. I can almost envision the can of queso with \"Extra Gloppy\" on the label. The two tacos I found even mildly inspiring were equally devoid of inspiration or flavor. The braised beef taco, which alleged on the menu the flavor of chipotle, recalled neither heat nor smoke. It was oddly reminiscent of last Sunday's  pot roast dinner (you know, the fatty bits you push around on your plate and hope no one will notice you are not eating). While the Asian shrimp taco was slightly more palatable, It too was found to be lacking. I urge the continued celebration of the taco. I also urge you do it elsewhere.",

I had the day's special margarita and I can't remember the name or what exactly was in it other than it had malibu rum in it.  I don't usually like malibu, but the mix of liquor was just right and probably the highlight of the evening.

    "text": "Vida is total garbage, and the price on this Yelp page is wrong. It's easily a $$$ restaurant.  Vida is the kid who's trying desperately to be cool but isn't wiling to put forward even the most basic of efforts. The biggest issue I have with Vida is the pricing, which to me is absolutely arrogant considering the quality of the food.   The cheapest way to eat at Vida is to get a $10 lunch special This will get you two of their super-thin quesadillas or 2 tacos, with a side of bland black beans and even blander rice. If you're not at lunch tough: their cheapest burrito that can't even hold a candle to Chipotle is $12 minimum. Anything else and you're looking at $15 +. Their excuse for a margarita is maybe a single shot of bottom shelf tequila in a tiny little 10 oz plastic cup. Their queso is good, but when the kitchen doesn't even bother microwaving it for you beforehand what's the point? Oh, and it's $7.  Whenever I've eaten at Vida I realize that the food tastes about as good as a place where I'd say \"I want combination A3\" instead of the pretentious titles the menu seems to use in order to suggest nonexistent quality. The only difference is I'm paying an extra 40% for their premium spot in the epicenter.  If you're on the fence about Vida, do one thing for me. Before walking in, go past the sign on the walkway towards the train and take a look at the kitchen entrance. Notice how it's regularly black from kitchen grease. Take a deep breath to inhale the stale, rotten smell and examine the trash they hide behind the sign. It's disgusting.  Vida is a fourth-rate hole in the wall that blew too much money on a graphic designer and gives exactly nothing about the quality of their food. There are easily half a dozen places inside the epicenter that are an order of magnitude better. Don't waste your time.",

Vida was spot on with some things and mediocre with others.  Our server John was wonderful.  Extremely friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu and drink offerings, he made great recommendations.  He knew all of the upcoming events going on and I will definitely request his section next time we come back.    In terms of the drinks, they had a great specialty drink list and an impressive variety of tequilas.  I had a melon mojito that was pretty good...not exceptional but definitely worth ordering another.  The chips and salsa are good...but definitely enhanced by the queso dip.  It was very very different from the quesos I've had at other Mexican-styled restaurants...and that was a great thing.  It was spicy and had different flavors in there I couldn't put my finger on...but it was delicious.  I had the chicken taquitos...which were pretty bland.  Maybe I just picked a bad dish, but as a taquito expert I was not very impressed.  The chicken was bland and the queso fresco scarce.  I will not be ordering those again.  The rice was good but nothing to write home about either.    Despite some of the let downs with the entrees I will definitely be going back.  The location and patio make it a top pick for happy hour drinks and the service is spectacular.  Hopefully I will be able to retract my current review on the food next time we go!",

    "text": "It was a cold and snowy Sunday afternoon... this reads like the start of a horror movie, but in the case of Vida there was no scare, just an relatively awesome food experience.  Now in fairness, it was snowing outside and it was a holiday weekend, so my party of 3 basically had the whole restaurant to ourselves.  Our server spent all the time in the world making recommendations on the menu and describing the dishes while making sure our drinks never ran empty.  Real world experience?  I dunno, but our server's knowledge of the menu and the preparation of the dishes was impressive and spot on, so I'm impressed regardless of whether he was resigned to the fact we'd be his only table for lunch service.  What impressed me most were the little extra touches that accompanied most dishes and drinks.  For example, I'm not quick to choose a margarita because of the sweetness or the cake of salt rimmed on the glass.  Vida, though, has a Partita, which uses agave nectar in place of sugar and fresh squeezed lime juice.  No salt needed because this guy is smooth and dangerous- as in, \"I could've drunk them all afternoon and gotten seriously messed up.\"  I also appreciated the inclusion of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce mixed into the salsa- it added that smoky zing that made the salsa memorable.  It was also adjustable according to your level of spice preference.  Perhaps it was the Partita getting to me, but I think I liked the first bowl clean.    Table-side guac is as fresh as it comes and also adjustable according to your likey of the spicy.  Just tell your chef as he mixes it all in the huge stone bowl before your eyes.  Freshly made chips, fried in-house accompanies your order, and our party of three cashed the whole thing.    My table shared three main dishes- the tortilla soup, a shrimp and lime salad, and carnita tacos.  All were very good.  The carnitas were some of the best I had, the meat was awesomely flavorful and moist.  The shrimp were grilled just right and the salad portion was sufficiently large.  In all, we three were stuffed and happy.  But we couldn't stop there- we also were talked into the homemade churros.  They come out piping hot, freshly fried, with a bowl of rich and dark dipping chocolate.  Calories be damned, because these things were worth every extra lap around the neighborhood I'll have to run to work them off.  One plate was enough to share.  Mexican is plentiful around Charlotte, but well-executed Mexican that stands out from the competition is hard to find.  Luckily for Vida, I think they've done it.  Each dish was smartly prepared without being an order-by-number conglomeration that is common at most Mexican joints.  If I had one suggestion, it would be that these guys get away from the mainly traditional dishes that populate their menu and get a little more creative.  The hints of inspiration are there and the kitchen obviously knows what it is doing, so I'd like to see them find new and interesting ways to bring those flavors to the table.  In the meantime, I will return, lured back by that awesome drink.  Viva Partita!",

The showcase didn't last that long and it was a beautiful day outside, so decided to take a walk towards the Epicenter and find a place to have a late lunch. Walked up on Vida Mexican, and decided to give it a try. The restaurant was empty inside, and everyone was sitting outside because of the beautiful weather. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink while our table outside became available. I ordered a Classic Mojito which ended up being really good. I find Mojito's can either be really bad, or really good. There seems to be no in between.   Once we finally got seated, our waiter brought us out some Chips and Salsa. I'm not sure what kind of salsa it was, but it was rather tasty. It definitely had a different kind of zing to it, but was enjoyable.   I ended up ordering the easy and simple Chicken Tacos which used grilled red chile chicken with black bean puree with a specialty blend of cheeses, chopped cilantro and pico de gallo with a side of red chile rice. No complaint here, and they definitely hit the spot.   Vida was quite enjoyable, but was rather pricey for Mexican. Its in a great location with being connected to the Epicenter though. I'm pretty sure it gets quite busy during the evenings. I definitely recommend for a nice lunch during a Saturday or Sunday afternoon if you happen to be uptown.",

Save yourself some money, soak some cardboard in warm water, place it on a warm corn tortilla, and eat it.  It isn't that the food tastes bad.  It's that it doesn't taste like anything at all.  I got a taco platter with three different types of tacos, pork, chicken, and beef.  They all tasted exactly the same, like an empty, warm, corn tortilla.  The only reason I gave them two stars was for the excellent wait staff.  Doesn't make up for the flavorless food.  Wouldn't even feed the leftovers to a dog.",

    "text": "Holy Guacamole I am in L-O-V-E with theirs! First off you get a ton so you wont end up with guac-envy if the table next to you hasn't finished theirs (hey it happens). Second of all it's fresh and made at your table with love - well maybe not but it really tastes that way.  Next we had the garlic shrimp which was mind altering good. I could have drank the delicious sauce it was swimming in...mmm.   Last we had the wild mushroom flautas which were a bit greasy and disappointing compared to the other two fabulous appetizers. I wouldn't get this next time.  We had two drinks - the Sangria which was pretty delicious. It was fizzy though which I haven't experienced before- but in a good way. The agave margaritas were all natural and quite refreshing as well.   We then decided to step it up a notch and have a shot of tequila (rough week!) we asked our server for a recommendation - he inquired about a price range and then came up with something that suited both our tastes and wallets. We were told they have a large selection if you're a tequila connoisseur.   Our server was friendly although at times MIA- we did have to track him down for drink numero dos. He also charged my card three times ($48, $66, $75) and never told me about the two voids. The next day when I went to check my account the charges were pending so they withheld that money. A quick call to the manager and my bank took care of that. I had wished the server told me that up front.   I will be going back for the guacamole and shrimp for sure. This is a great option for uptown eats albeit slightly pricey when compared to other Mexican options in the area.",

It's definitely one their most flavorful dishes on the menu. The chorizo adds a whole new depth of flavor and every now and then you get that hint of cilantro which meshes well with the tomato-based background. I'm eating it right now and it may well become a go-to item whenever I come here.",

If you don't have reservations and show up promptly...they turn you away.  I watched it happen twice.   I'm in another area of service Industry...and I don't believe in turning anyone away for any reason.  First Impression....decor was nice...not too over the top...but still had that Epicenter feel.  Great menu with lots of variety.   I ordered shrimp...it came out COLD.  So I sent it back...and then guy who brought it back to me said \"Now hurry and eat it before it gets cold again\".... I was appalled.    It's not my fault that my food was sitting in the window too long before it hit the table.    After the \"re-cook\"  it was fine....I enjoyed my meal.  Service was lacking....between the bouncer guy at the door of a restaurant and the slacker that was waiting on us...I'm surprised that we made it to our next venue in time.  Our waiter maybe came over 2 times the entire time.... I just thought he was on a perpetual smoke break someplace.  Waitstaff can definitely be a little more attentive.  I probably will not go back due to the price:service/quality ratio.  It wasn't awful...but it was FAR FROM STELLAR.",

In all honesty, I wish I could offer a review of more dishes, but I go there for one reason--the naked burrito with queso or as I refer to it--heaven in a bowl.  The burrito comes with a delicious grilled corn, which is the best I've ever had.  I've also sampled their chicken tostada for lunch which was also excellent, but the burrito is special.  While I haven't strayed from this dish much, my wife has enjoyed several dishes there, most recently the shrimp tacos.  Overall, the service is excellent because of their quick and attentive staff.  The lone drawback for me is that they don't validate, so you're left for looking for a space in uptown or paying for parking.",

Bisected tree trunks cast in cement in the entry way and main dining area are comparable to cobblestone paths (charming, but be careful, ambulation on them isn't as easy as it looks), and seatbelts woven into surprisingly comfortable chair and stool seats strap patrons in for upscale Mexican cuisine. Al fresco dining options overlook busy College and Trade Streets, which is prime real estate for people watching.  The food itself at Vida Mexican Kitchen Y Cantina is good, but not great, especially for the price tag. Menu stand outs include the Pork Barbacoa and the Chicken and Corn Enchiladas entrees, while the Grilled Corn with Queso Fresco and the Pineapple Papaya Coleslaw are beautifully summery sides. The ubiquitous chips and salsa also deserve a nod, as the salsa has just the right amount of kick to make the longer than average wait for the entrees more enjoyable. Those that enjoy guacamole also sang the praises of the Table Side Guacamole.  Skinny Margaritas, Vida's 100 calorie creations that are \"full of liquor\", as one server put it, are served in martini glasses. Be careful not to make the rookie mistake of not paying the bar bill prior to heading to your table, though, because attempting to separate the bills out along with the dinner bill led to frustration and wasted time for the group and the adorably accented server. Had the server in the bar area not told the group that it wouldn't be a problem divvy the bill at the table, it would have saved us all an extra 30 minutes and a distaste for the restaurant itself.",

Went last night with a group of six people and we couldn't finish the bowl, which is unprecedented.  This was my second visit to Vida, and it was just as delicious as the first time. The decor is quite trendy (check out wood chunks in the floor) and the bar area is large and generally busy from just after 5 p.m. until the wee hours. There are a ton of seating options as well as an upstairs area that's great for small groups.   Our server was a bit slow last night, although other servers/food runners were all over keeping our water glasses and chip bowls full. The chicken and corn enchiladas, garlic shrimp quesadillas, and chicken tacos ordered at our table were all very good. And the plantains are a must have if you're a fan. Keep in mind that portion sizes are humongous, so you may want to share. And for beverages, there is a full bar, multiple beer and wine choices, and skinny margaritas or sangria for those who would like a specialty drink.  Uptown needed a solid Mexican option, and Vida has definitely fit the bill. Salud!",

As for the service, our waitress was nice. My friends were satisfied with their meals...but not Wowed. Not sure why I continue to come here. Maybe it's the drinks. Possibly, I should try other items on the menu.   The restaurants in the Epicenter have went downhill. Not sure why, but the food isn't as good. Kinda sad when you think about it. With all the amazing nightlife in this area you can't find decent food. Your better off going to Wendy's or Burger King.   Ok, my Kanye West rant is over now.... I will return here again.

We were waiting for one more person in our group to arrive when we were seated. The bartender was our server and right away asked us when the last person in our group was arriving because they were closing soon. He arrived shortly after 10pm and prior to that the bartender forced us to order our food because the kitchen was closing. He continued to mention several times that they are trying to close. We ordered drinks and food and then when we asked for the check he said he would give us a discount since he rushed us out. Food was pretty good, service was completely unacceptable. I would not come here again unless during the daytime and with a different server.",

I got the jalapeno shrimp and a veggie taco. Both were really good, but nothing special. The second time I came I got the Vida chicken salad, which was a little blah. Nothing too exciting with this salad. Toppings were bare and the chicken was over cooked/ crunchy- please note this was a $13 salad and was a \"signature item\" on their menu. Woof!   Other people I was with ordered the taco salad, which looked amazing, and the burrito which was the size of a small baby. They had no complaints. I would definitely order the taco salad next time. The chips and salsa are a plus here though and saved me from giving this a 3 star review.   My advice- go to cantina 1511 over vida for 'fancier' Mexican.",

We arrived a little before 10pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately , then as soon as we were seated David brought us fresh chips and salsa (Yum!). I got the chicken and spinach enchiladas with fried plantains and the chile rice, and my boyfriend got the beer battered fish tacos with the corn queso and chile rice. Both were delicious! The tacos were definitely my fav though, and the fried plantains were done to perfection! Really nice atmosphere and incredible service! Connor was friendly and helpful, and made our overall dining experience so enjoyable! Definitely will return if ever in Charlotte again. Highly recommend.",

They are a little pricey for Mexican Food, but it's because of location, so I can put up with it since it allows me to walk here from home. They have a variety of drinks, which is appreciated. The meals I've gotten here, all chicken dishes, have been delicious. The portions are huge so I end up sharing or taking half home. They also have really good, fresh salsa here, which is probably my favorite thing about Mexican food. Maybe that's why I can't finish my meals - too many chips and too much salsa. :) Ambiance here is also cool, it's not traditional it's modern and elegant. I like this spot.",

It wasn't very busy at all, so I would say this is a good spot to eat after happy hours in the Epicentre. The only problem is the food is pricey for that idea when you just want bar food or simple tacos, where this is more of a premium Mexican restaurant.  Speaking of the food, I had the chicken tinga, which was just ok despite the fun I had saying the name aloud multiple times. A great idea with red chile sauce, chicken, and a fried egg on top, but it could have used more spice. We also had the combo #1 which I thought was a good deal with multiple tacos and mildly priced.   Nice spot conveniently located in the Epicentre but there are plenty of options around which hurts the repeat visits.",

The food was great and arrived at our table in no time, minus the chips & salsa which came out after our food. The drinks were good, we had a strawberry mango frozen Margarita & millionaire _______. The millionaire was $15 alone, I didn't taste it but my bf said it was strong. I ordered a combo 2 and he had a combo 3. We finished EVERYTHING! I recommend getting corn tortillas, you get a choice of flour & corn which were both pretty good but the corn melts in your mouth.   I felt the food was overpriced compared to what I pay for Mexican food in Atlanta, we paid over $60 for 2 meals & drinks & a small side of Queso, for freaking $1.50",

Got the shredded beef tacos which comes with rice and black beans. One of the tacos had really dry, overcooked beef. They fry their tortillas, which is usually good, but at this restaurant they were soaking in oil and they were better off not frying them (specifically the corn tortilla). The flavor was lacking and overall the dish was salty.   Service was really slow but we were a big party. If there's a plus, the vibe and the ambience of the place was really nice. They also provide free chips and salsa.  All in all, it wasn't too bad and I was full, but I wouldn't go back.",

The tuna tacos, the crab and shrimp enchiladas and my new fav- smoked salmon tacos. Smoked salmon tacos you ask.... why yes, this is in fact a brunch item. I never thought of Vida as a brunch place until I had these. All the brunch plates come with fruit and jalapeno potatoes.   I'm a big fan of the salsa here. I love guac and queso, so sometimes I have a hard deciding which to order at a Mexican restaurant. When it comes to Vida, I go with the guac. Personal preference.  Now this is important, sit outside. IMO, Vida has the best patio for sight-seeing in uptown. And by sight-seeing, I of course mean people watching. Bubble (directly above it) also has a killer patio, but they don't have chips and salsa.  The Epicentre parking garage is a total rip-off. Unless you are heading to the movies (which validates), park anywhere else or take the lightrail here. There is an Epicentre stop. Parking on the street is free after 6pm. The Wake Forest deck (next to Fitzgerald's) is usually only five dollars. Fitz also validates that deck is you feel like popping in for a drink before you head home.",

I had just the simple tacos and was blown away. The tortillas were just ever so slightly cripsy, light, and very very fresh tasting.

Specially for someone who enjoys tequila's because they have a ton of tequila's. The food I found to be a little off for the most part. At first I thought maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, then other people said their food was not very good either. I would give their guac a 5 our of 5. The queso a 1 out of 5. It was horrible. Out of a group of about 10 it was barely touched. Usually queso get demolished at any mexican restaurant and your asking for more chips to finish it off. Not the case here unfortunately. I had their barbacoa for my entree. Im not really sure how the barbocoa actually is because it was drenched in their barbeque sauce. The sauce was not very good unfortunately. I did think that the servers and the drinks were real good.",

My server recommended the tacos because they come on flour tortillas instead of corn.  He also said the shredded beef was best so I got the 3 taco combo with  shredded beef, carne asada, and ground beef.  All 3 were very good but my favorite was the shredded beef, it was the juiciest!  Each taco had a different sauce and there was plenty of meat in each toasted homemade flour tortilla.  The black beans and spanish rice were also delicious.  Of course this is not the kind of place where someone's mexican grandma is cooking in the back so don't expect truly authentic homemade mexican food but you will still enjoy your food.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  The portion size is perfect and you will leave feeling satisfied but not stuffed like a fat pig lol.   I will definitely go back and I highly recommend the shredded beef.  You can get carnitas anywhere so try something different!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Mexican food. I knew that good Mexican food was going to be scarce in Charlotte compared to California so I made sure to eat as much Mexican as possible before coming out here.  I had only been here for a little over a week before I started missing it. I'm notorious for asking the bf \"what's for dinner\" over breakfast and the day I wanted Mexican was no different. Just based on proximity/convenience and the so-so reviews on Yelp, we decided to go to Vida after he got off work.   I'm not sure which way the entrance is but I think we came in from the patio entrance since the door opened directly into the bar area and we had to cross the bar area to get to the host stand. It was a little before 5pm so it was fairly empty. I couldn't help but notice the heavy smell of air (un)freshner. It was overwhelming! It's a restaurant, not a hotel. It's okay for it to smell like food. And it wasn't even good air freshener like the ocean-y spa smell that they pump into the air at Mandalay Bay in Vegas. It smelled like cheap perfume. I thought I was going to get a headache for sure. It was almost unappetizing, but I really wanted my Mexican food so we stayed.  Don't laugh. I ordered a salad. Yes, after all that. They didn't have the dish that I wanted so I went with the shrimp salad ($11.99). And it was actually good. It had mango, avocado, and about six decent sized shrimp. The shrimp tasted like it was prepared like shrimp scampi. The lime vinaigrette went well with it.  The bf got the crab and shrimp enchiladas ($17.99). He was happy with it, but I tried it and, um, I wasn't too impressed, especially for that price. The tortilla was doughy and flavorless  Writing about this just made me think of the giant shrimp burritos that they serve back in the taquerias in Cali *drooling* And for only $9!  It looks like they have good drink specials though. They had Friday drink specials listed on the table cards advertising a bucket of Coronas for $15, Coronas for $3.50, and Coronaritas for $7. The bf had a margarita for $3.50 since the waiter let us know that they were half off that day (Monday).   Ricky, our waiter, was very good. And the chips and salsa were decent with the chips being just a tad bit too salty. I think I'll just stick to coming here for drinks. Oh, and maybe I'll try the guacamole since I've read in a few tips that it was good. I'd be open to try some appetizers but I think I'll pass on the entrees. Sooo I definitely think Mexican food will be the first meal I have when I get home. lol. Until then, I will stick to the southern food while I'm here. Like they say, \"When in Rome...\" Or should I say, \"When in the South.\" ;)",

I like Vida just as much as I like those things because they don't have just a good brunch; they have a great brunch...   The staff was fantastic... You could barely finish your meal before they would ask if you were done with it... They do not believe in letting plates sit around and clog up a table... I like that... The refills kept coming without a lull, which was also great...   I went for the chorizo tacos and I was not disappointed... You could probably put jalapeno bacon on anything and I'd eat it, though... lol  Seriously, scrambled eggs, cheese, cilantro and chorizo?  All wrapped in some floury goodness?  I was full midway into the second one, but I kept trying to finish... I still get a tear in my eye when I think about that last bite I left on my plate... I couldn't focus on just the tacos, though, because the potatoes they give you were awesome!  That's probably because they had jalapeno in them as well... The fruit was very good... They've got to get their stuff from a market, that wasn't grocery store fruit... lol  I loved the look of the restaurant and since we were seated upstairs, it gave us a nice view of all the goings on downstairs... The drinks were fantastic... I had Cointreau Noir and Vida margaritas... They were both sublime... The frozen Vida margarita didn't have that weird, watery taste that most frozens end up with, so I was very excited about that...   The prices weren't bad at all, but they don't validate parking, so I would suggest going there, but making better arrangements than the dreaded Epicentre lot... lol",

No, the one star reflects the uncaring, robotic, demeaning service I got from their staff, other than the guy who showed me to the table and offered me chips I didn't want.   I'm sure once they see my photo, they won't give a damn about this review, because clearly they didn't care that night whether or not I was treated like a human being, much less a customer. For whatever reasons - my age, my lack of designer clothes - the staff decided I simply didn't matter that night.  I can't remember the last time I went into a place like this and didn't leave some kind of tip, but this time I didn't. I ended up giving it to some homeless guy instead to make myself feel better.   I left wondering if the staff is trained to ask questions and not wait for answers, That happened twice that night. That's pathetic.  I ended up just getting a salad with seared tuna. It actually wasn't that bad. But I will never go back.",

    "text": "Came here on Friday night (around 6pm)........should have known better and made a reservation. Since the Eagels were playing that night, Vida was slammed! Without a reservation, it was an hour and a half wait. We had other plans for the evening, so we decided to see if we could grab two seats (or heck, one would work!) from the bar. No such luck. I felt bad cause there were many couples, like us, hovering around the bar just waiting for one of those coveted seats. No joke, we literally stood behind these two women sipping their beers for almost 45 minutes. Probably, two of the most slowest beer drinkers I have ever met....but I digress.....Anyways, we soon discovered that the wait to sit outside wasn't very long and we put our name on the list. We were seated outside (wasn't too cold....they had a heater out there but it wasn't turned on).  We ordered a bucket (5 beers) of Coronas and some guac. I really really love guacamole.....like, it's an issue. They have some fantastic guac. Nothing Truely beats the guac I make, but this is a close second. We also chose to split a burrito meal. We were bar hopping that night and figured we didn't need two meals. Man, so glad we split. The serving was huge!! The burrito was delish. The grilled corn as the side was so good!   All in all, I would have given this place 3 stars, but the food was so good it made me forget about standing behind the slow beer drinking women! Since we walked here, I can't comment on parking. We have been here numerous times in the past and will continue to return.",

Appears this location has two parts.. The faster food, casual area and the more formal side.  Overall casual Mexican restaurant. Ordered the the Seared tuna over mixed greens with avocado, corn and assorted vegetables. The tuna was bright pink (I'll admit it kind of freaked me out a bit BUT) all in all it was delicious. Not the most Mexican Mexican dish around but defiantly beyond satisfying!  Perks: Always love me some free chips and salsa Perks: Margs were good, not overly sweet",

Since my first stop I've gone back several times for just their guacamole. This is the best guacamole I've found in Charlotte, with a very decent price for the amount you get. And I keep coming back for the margaritas! This is the only place in uptown that makes a decent margarita, and one of the few places in Charlotte that makes them strong but limey. Perfect margaritas for this West Coast girl!",

From the minute we got there til the minute we left, everything was awesome!    We started with a delicious, refreshing margarita for me and a snifter of tequila for the fella - he said it was the best tequila he's ever had.  We then moved onto dinner and I got the tacos (1 al pastor, 1 carnitas and 1 beef).  They were all really good, but i loved the pineapple on the al pastor - good mix of sweet and salty.  Fellla got the chicken taquitos, and they were crispy, light and fresh.  Our waitress, Jackie, was so engaging and personable, and she had great food/drink recommendations, and the sales and marketing VP, Andrea, even checked in on us to see how we were and chatted for a few minutes.    I don't know how they all found the time to provide such great customer service, but it's a rare thing these days, and I love patronizing places that put such a great emphasis on it.  I'll definitely be back soon.",

After my first experience I would not have chosen to return, but we had a big group, and I was more interested in being with friends than pushing restaurant choice.   I judge Mexican places on four basics: guacamole, tacos, salsa, and margaritas. I set out to give Vida two stars, but had to bump it up to three when I realized that the only terrible thing out of these four was the tacos. But the tacos were bad. So bad. If I cannot finish a taco? Bad. The salsa and guacamole were fair. The margaritas were excellent., especially the pomegranate variety (but $11? Really? Stupid.)   The ceviche was not good, and was also not technically ceviche. I don't know what the sauce was they drenched it in, but ease up there, chief. Simple: lime, garlic, a little spice -- that's all you need. Not whatever the red stuff was. Ick. I also tried tortilla soup on the lunch visit, and didn't care for that either.   The service was accommodating both times, especially for our large dinner group, so that also ranks the extra star. But really, in my heart, it's two for a bad taco.",

That being said, you would think we would have had excellent service and our orders correct.. Instead, terribly slow service, orders incorrect/incomplete. Had my friend not been an employee I would have insisted on asking for a manager. For starters, drinks from the bar took about 10 minutes if not longer to arrive at the table. For a restaurant less than half full, that is too long. As for the food, I asked for no jalapenos on my potatoes. They come out with it and our server quickly notices and offers to bring me another serving of them. She does and now they are without cheese.. Whatever, fine. Next two from our table are missing the bacon from their order, ask for it and the server brings them ONE serving and asks if that's ok.. Really.. Really? Sure, that's fine they would love to share 2 pieces of bacon. Who shares bacon? I believe had a member of the party not been an employee we may have had different treatment, but you would have thought we would have at least gotten a prompt service as well as accurate orders. Shame on the chef, and shame on the server or whoever checks plates at the window for overlooking 3 out of 6 plates. I wouldn't recommend brunch here, there are many other options in the Charlotte uptown area.",

We got there slightly early but our table was ready to go and the server was on point with taking our drink and app orders while we waited for everyone else to get there.   We got seated upstairs and yes, the floor is really slippery. Have someone to hold onto and be careful going up and down the stairs too.   The upstairs was awesome! I wanna sit here every time. It had its own bar and waitstaff. Our waiter and waitress were awesome! They were so attentive and even with our large group they were patient and got everything right.  We got the margaritas, crab nachos and taquitos. Even splitting it, it was too much food and we were very hungry when we got there. The portions were overwhelming and since the food was heavy, we got full quickly.   They had some wonderful desserts on the menu but we didn't get to try them, next time for sure.  A few notes, there is valet service or you can park in the Epicentre garage. Valet is 15/20? and Parking is 10bucks typically. You can also take the light rail, the stop is right behind the restaurant. Get the back bean plantain mash, I didn't get it but I tried my brother's and it was good.",

We were in Charlotte for a concert at Time Warner. The event started at 7 so we made reservations for 5:30. We checked in and were taken to a table in about 5 minutes. It took about 10 minutes to be greeted. Our servers name was Shelby. We were waiting on a friend who was stuck in traffic  so we ordered drinks and an appetizer. The drinks took 25 minutes. We also went ahead and ordered dinner because we did not want to be late for the event. It's now 615 and we stil don't have dinner. When our friend showed up she ordered a margarita from the bar and her dinner...the margarita took another  20 minutes and was delivered in a plastic cup half full. (Her food never came) Our food finally arrived around 635pm. As soon as the food was delivered we asked Shelby for our checks and boxes...at 650 we had to call a manger over to ask for our checks again...when Shelby finally brought them back they had ran my card twice...and my friends not at all. It's now 655 and I have to try to get my check fixed....I went to the host stand and asked for a different manager to fix my checks because I am now late at this point. I asked her to fix it and when she asked me how everything was I said horrible and she said to just not worry about it. It has now been a full 7 days and the hold is still on my account.   I will not be returning to this restaurant. Like I said, the food is good but if you are going to be across the street from a major venue like that then you need to be more prepared for a rush before showtime. Everyone in there was in a hurry and there were people seated after us that left before us. Such a shame, such a great location.",

    "text": "As an Angeleno, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Vida holds its own against some of the better taco places in LA. Sure, it's not Grand Central Market where there's sawdust on the floor and a guy in a stand serves you one pound cabeza tacos on a double layer of freshly made corn tortillas, but this is the Epicenter of Uptown Charlotte, NC. I wasn't expecting much. In fact, from the outside, I thought I was going to get stuck with overpriced, Americanized Mexican food. I was mistaken.  My colleagues and I ended up splitting an order of the guacamole. $8.99 seemed mighty pricey at first, but they give you a veritable fuck ton of it in a mortar-style bowl and it was friggin delicious. Granted, it wasn't made fresh at the table (oh how I wish it was), but it was very nice. Lots of avocado, both on the front of the palate from the first bite and also in the large chunks that were mixed in.   I ordered a lunch special of the house salad plus a carnitas taco. The salad was above average, with a healthy mix of greens, a slice of avocado and some corn. The black beans + rice was surprisingly tasty, maybe even ranking near the top of what I've had. Black beans especially were sinfully fatty.  The taco was excelente. Carnitas were tender and full of juicy flavor, showing that they had indeed been marinated and then cooked over several hours. The tortilla was warm and melted in my mouth. If it wasn't made fresh that day, it sure tasted like it.  Overall, the lunch was fairly light: one medium-sized taco, a small mix of rice and beans and a small house salad. Were it not for the guacamole, I would have walked away feeling pretty good about my portions.  Will I race back here? Probably not. But it's a solid place to have lunch or dinner... and I'm dying to try out their tequila selection.",

    "text": "Great location. Cool vibe. Attentive service. . .and, sadly, that's it. We had been looking forward to trying this place for quite some time since we have seen it front center at the EpiCentre.  We finally got the chance and were completely underwhelmed.  First we started with some margaritas--these should be an easy way to please anyone. They weren't.   The skinny margarita was just awful and I've had some good ones at other places in town (such as 1900 Mexican Grill which has a fantastic one). The regular margarita was just passable.  Perhaps the premium margaritas ones are better but I suspect we won't be back to try again.  The chips and salsa were really quite good.   After devouring 2 bowls of chips because they were so good we  figured the food would dazzle us.  We could not decide among all of the delicious offerings so tried 2 of the combo platters to try a good variety of the food.  They were chock full of good quality ingredients (crab, shrimp, fish, avocados) but somehow were rendered almost tasteless. Nothing stood out, except for the fact that the soft corn tortillas were greasy. The food at a casual burrito shop is easily more pleasing.  In college I worked in an average Mexican restaurant and the entrees here didn't even come close.   The banana tres leches cake for dessert was intensely flavored (nice change from the bland meal) but really good (if you don't fear banana flavor). It isn't a traditional tres leches so the waiter tried to steer us away from it.  I understand why, but it was very good and potent.  All in all this was a disappointment (chips, salsa and dessert excepted) and we love Mexican food. Not sure if we'd waste the calories on another try when there are so many other Mexican options in the Queen City.  That's too bad because the location is great and there aren't any other Mexican places uptown.",

I decided to go with the combo that had a carne asada taco, chicken taco and pork avocado enchilada. The tacos were really tasty but really greasy. The enchilada had a cinnamon flavor which I thought was weird; not bad, just different. The margarita was ok; nothing too exciting.

We sat outside, on the bar side since the dine-in side was pretty crowded.  I thought that the crowd meant the food was good, so I was happy.  We were pretty hungry so we ordered the Chips and Salsa and added the Guacamole for an appetizer.  My wife and daughter shared in the 6 tacos platter while I opted for the Nachos and added some groud beef at an additional charge.  The service was decent.  Nothing really special, but I felt like we were taken care of.  The Chips arrived first and were pretty good.  The Salsa was Fantastic!!  Probably my favorite part of the meal.  The Guacamole left a lot to be desired.  My wife and I both agreed that it was pretty bland and needed some salt to heighten the flavor.  My Nachos were ok.  My only knock on is that the ground beef was also very bland.  It really had no taste.  The 6 Tacos platter included 2 veggie tacos, 2 fried chicken tacos and 2 grilled chicken tacos.  I was surprised to see that the soft flour tortillas were fried and therefore, were very greasy.  I was not a fan of that and neither was my wife.    For drinks, we ordered 2 ginger ales and 1 lemonade for my daughter.  My wife thought the lemonade tasted like what they would use for a Margarita.  Overall, we spent about $45 including a 15% tip.  So I don't think the place is too bad price-wise, considering we got plenty of food.  But I wish the flavors were more vibrant.  The waitress did mention that the menu is different with more options on the dine-in side of the venue, so I might give this place another chance some day since we were sitting on the \"bar\" side.",

    "text": "I've been to Vida plenty of times. I'm a lover of all things Mexican. And tequila. And cheese. Anywho... I've had my share of good dishes here and some not so good. Not bad just... ehhh... here's the deal.   Years ago when the hot spot first opened, I would go constantly simply for the queso fundido. It was a thing with my friend Ray and myself to hit up the Checkers games then walk over to Vida and snag some cheese and drinks. However, sadly, they took the fundido away. Sigh... Vida, feel free to bring that back at any point. Nonetheless they still have queso but it doesn't hold a candle to the fundido.   If I go for lunch, I always get the ABLT - thats avocado on a BLT. It comes with a cilantro mayo but that's not my thing so I ask them to 86 the mayo, side of honey mustard. The sandwich is light and comes on an almost ciabatta-like bun.   If I do dinner, I get the crab meat nachos time and time again. Topped with crab meat, melted cheese, mashed black beans and avocado (hi, I'm Nikki and I love avocado). The nachos are individually crafted, piled high on each chip with yummy goodness.   Last time I went I got the ahi tuna salad. The ahi tuna was cooked mid-rare, absolutely perfect, but the ingredients in the salad didn't seem to jive. This is the ehhh I was talking about earlier. And the cilantro lime dressing left me a bit disappointed. For an appetizer, we had some type of mushroom wraps which I'd say go ahead and skip.   However, if you have a margarita craving, this is the place to quench your thirst. Variety of styles. A pleathra of tequila choices. And a good number of flavors to choose from.",

I've never been a fan and will choose a grilled steak over mexican fare, any day. But this place was soooo trendy that I had to try it.  My boyfriend and I started at the bar with Margaritas and wholly guacamole and tortilla chips! Yum, Yum, Yum. The drinks were superb and my boyfriend loved all of the tvs. The drinks here are very creative and you will want to try more than one.  I ordered the chicken enchilada accompanied with some sort of corn side dish. I am a corn freak! That corn stuff was tasty! The enchilada was good (remember i don't like mexican) but I wouldn't order it again. My boyfriend loves any kind of food. He ordered the chicken fajitas and plantains.  He never picked his head up. Lol. He was in heaven. He doesn't even do that when I cook. :O  4 stars because service was great, the place is trendy, the drinks are great, if you love mexican food...you'll love this place.  I didn't have a problem with the music...I like dancing at the table. hehe",

It is a bit hustle and bustle, but I love that atmosphere.  For apps I had the guacamole and cheese dip.  The guacamole is so incredible.  I also had a cheese quesadilla and it was decent enough.  The margaritas were on special here and it was nice to have a good drink and sit back and watch the views.  I think the guacamole and service were great here.  Its not your typical mexican fare and I think next time I will order something a little more special to Vida!",

    "text": "This place is trendy and has a decent atmosphere if you care about that...The best thing was the Guacamole.  It was fresh and there was plenty of it so that was a plus.  The entrees were over-priced and bland at best.  I ordered the marinated shrimp tacos and it looked and tasted like cocktail shrimp, just a bit warmer...every other flavor blended together.    We had a party of 6 and none of us enjoyed our meals.  Everyone had the same feedback..:\"it was bland.\"  If you go to a Mexican restaurant you expect the flavors to POP!  This is NOT traditional mexican--obviously--and the only way you would even know it was supposed to be a mexican restaurant is because they serve chips and salsa.  The service was not that great and it felt rushed, especially as it started to get more crowded.  They just seemed unorganized.    The thing that annoyed me about this \"nicer\" restaurant is that after taking two bites of my shrimp cocktail taco, I put it down and didn't touch the rest on my plate.  I did eat the refried blacked beans and they were pretty yummy...but other than that--my plate looked untouched.  As a waiter, you should realize that someone didn't touch their food and ask if everything is okay--I was a waitress for several years and that is just basic server 101.  If you care at all about repeat customers and their opinions then you need to take notice if they didn't eat their meal...at least ASK if everything is okay.  I'm not saying he had to comp the meal or anything like that but to just act oblivious is also just ridiculous.  There are soooo many amazing mexican restaurants that are more affordable, half the drama, and way more authentic.  Save your money and go somewhere else.",

Pretty confusing that Vida and Vida Vida are two different restaurants, but the more elegant section has good food, decent drinks, and the bartender was very helpful in food and drink selections. The skinny margarita is not excellent but it is mostly tequila and artificial sweetener so, for what it is it's okay. Other margaritas are okay but they don't have much of a drink selection otherwise. Overall a good experience.",

We were seated quickly and before we got settled at our table we had chips and salsa placed on our table (which was amazing!) I ordered a mango margarita that was oh-so-good. I ordered 3 tacos: 1) Fish taco was my least favorite. It was fresh tasting but seemed it needed more seasoning. Probably better fried. 2) Beef taco was good. Typical. 3) Chicken red chile taco was great! The grilled onions and spicy sauce made the taste even more complex and tasty. The only downfall with service was that our waiter made us feel a little rushed to leave near the end of our meal. Outside of that, overall good experience. I'll definitely be back. But probably only for the taco Tuesday as the prices seem a little high to me for Tex-Mex cuisine.",

The tacos are served three for dinner, two for lunch.  You also get to choose two sides for dinner and one for lunch. I tried the shrimp tacos for dinner and they were very tasty! I had the green rice and fried plantains, both delicious. On my lunch excursion, I had the carne asada tacos. They were pretty good as well, and I had a repeat of the plantains for my side, I loved them that much (just be prepared for a bit of grease.)

Their food was probably between 3-4 stars, note the \"was\". I had not gone to Vidas for 2-3 months, but this visit was a severe disappointment. Not only did they raise the prices on their menus, they made it so you can't select your side from their list of sides when ordering from 3/4 of the menu.  Let's get onto the food... there is something to be said about a restaurant when the chips and salsa are the best thing for your meal. I ordered a Cobb Salad, but due to the \"loudness\" in the restaurant, the order was taken as a House Salad. Sigh... I was in a rush, so I did not have them make a new salad. Either way, the salad was ALOT of iceberg lettuce. There was 1/4 of an avocado, some corn, and simple beans. Fairly bland dressing... all for $7. I am not sure what part of that salad constitutes the extra $4, maybe the location?  Another person ordered a ground beef taco. People at Qdoba, Chipotle, or any of the fast food \"Mexican\" joints at least know how to drain the fat from the meat before putting it into the taco shell. Vida apparently does not understand this process. The taco my friend got was a soggy mess dripping with grease. When you can see your reflection on the taco, not good.  The review would probably side on the lower end of 2 stars, I was debating giving only 1 star.",

    "text": "Vida is one of our go-to Mexican spots in Charlotte, especially when we have guests in town. We've rarely (if ever) had to wait for a table, even on weekends. I'm consistently impressed by the service we've received. Everyone is constantly keeping an eye on our drinks to make sure they're refilled and we usually get a refill of chips after we've scarfed down the first basket (because why not?).   I usually opt for the taco plate and leave stuffed with leftovers for lunch the next day. The \"Shrimp Jalapeno Bacon\" is a must-try; very flavorful and unique. Avoid the Carnitas; I'm usually a big fan, but every time I've tried them at Vida the pork has been too dry for my taste.   This past visit I tried the \"Combo 1\" that included a red chile chicken taco, carne asada steak taco, and a green chili pork and avocado enchilada, plus rice and beans. I'm proud of myself for going out of my comfort zone, but still recommend the tacos for dinner. My favorite part about the combo meal was the chicken taco; everything else was good, but again, a bit dry.   If you're a salad person, the Vida House is fantastic - very fresh, light, and some unique twists to your typical house salad at a Mexican restaurant (cilantro lime vinaigrette, jicama....). Yum.   4 stars because I think it's a bit pricey, but you do get a LOT of food for your buck.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my time at the Vegan night hosted by a meetup group I found. Vida Mexican Kitchen y Cantina offered a four-course meal that was 100% vegan.   I was super pleased to hear that the chef spent time creating the menu, ensuring the kitchen was cleaned properly, and that there were no traces of improper food exchanges while cooking. He made everything fresh and wow was it noticeable in the food.   I started with the chips and salsa which was very fresh, then they made fresh guacamole. For my entree, I selected the veggie tacos with rice and black beans. They also made vegan beverages, but I wasn't drinking that evening; however, my friends said it was really delicious.  My only pit about the event was the wait for our checks. I don't believe they were fully prepared for the processing of our bills. The items they created wasn't in the system so they had to manually enter in 15 orders which took about 40minutes. I would highly suggest for any future events that this is something they have programmed ahead of time. A lot of the guest was irritated and ready to leave.   I would recommend they offer more vegan entrees that they offered this night.",

    "text": "TERRIBLE!!!!   I ordered a cheese quesadilla with rice, cilantro, and grilled onions inside. There was unfortunately chicken inside. The waitress argued that there was no chicken and then looked at me shocked when I lifted the tortilla up to find a hunk of meat. They also had the rice on the side and not inside.   Rice- incredibly spicy and not good  I ended up re ordering a plain cheese quesadilla and it was so spicy I couldn't eat it.   Margarita - ok, but very sweet  No apology from Vida, just bad all around!!",

I've been here for lunch and dinner many times. Today I came with a group of friends for their first ever Drag Brunch. Food and a show? Count this piggy in!   We started with a brunch buffet. I gorged on the breakfast favorites- scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon and home fries. Eggs were seasoned well, home fries were cooked with onions for that extra oomph of flavor and bacon, well, bacon is never bad.   Then add in brunch the Vida way - chicken taquitos, mushroom sopes, carne asada y arroz, chorizo tacos and cheese quesadillas. Oh my goodness. No, I'm not even done yet. Throw in some pastries, cornbread, fresh fruit and countless tequila shots. Yep, that's how I Brunch!   Everything I ate was delicious but the chicken taquitos were by far my fave. There were 4 different salsas - but no chips. No worries, I sopped up the salsas with my meal. Well, meals. Let's face It, I probably had 4 full plates of food. Cheat day, ok?   After we ate, we enjoyed a wonderful show put on by the lovely ladies. This was their first Drag show at the restaurant and I really really really hope it's not the last. I enjoyed myself so much and know my girlfriends all did too.",

Talk about tasteless....It tasted like 4 day old chicken that's was left in the refrigerator uncovered. Now I understand why this place was almost empty at lunch time on Saturday. How can anyone mess up a salad? The chef really missed the mark on this one. When I sent the food back the bartender tasted it and agreed that something was off with the chicken. It would've been nice for the manager on duty to come by and ask why I was sending the food back but I guess he didn't care either.",

We went to the restaurant there was an AKA event on the bar side. When we came in we were greeted and seated. Staff were nice. Had the skinny margarita which is weak. The server noted its alcohol mostly - not! I didn't get the regular or other options because they are pre made. Don't waste your money on his drink. We tried another the one of my favorites  in general a Brazilian drink, the Caipirinha. I'm so glad they didn't mess it up. It was good I could actually taste the alcohol. The server was busy didn't see him waiting on tables on our side, but it took him forever to bring stuff out.  I was happy that I was able to try various tacos instead of getting all one flavor. The beer battered cod/ fish taco was the best. It wasn't spicy but had a good amount of flavor. The chicken taco was horrible I was very surprised considering that most people eat chicken and lacked flavor. The shrimp taco with the jalapenos and bacon was super spicy. The rice wasn't cooked properly and the beans were just OK. I am shocked. Had better in food quality. I think you pay for location. Good luck.",

I must say the chicken was my favorite and since I go here for lunch on occasion I'm sure I'll get the chicken tacos again. I also had a mojito and although not my favorite it wasn't horrible.

    "text": "This is one of the times I really wish we could do half stars, cause 5 stars should only be for perfect meals and it wasn't quite there, but it was close.  A definite 4.5  From reading the other reviews I kinda wonder if this is the same restaurant.  We called 45 mins in advance on restaurant week, and they said no problem.  Place was packed when we got there, but we were seated right away.  Chips, salsa, and water almost instantly.  We were obviously wanting drinks, so our waitress asked quickly, but it took us a while to decide.  She came by 3 times before we were ready.  Finally said Partita Margaritas for all.  Sweetened with agave nectar, so not too sweet and better for you.  We had the table side guac, that I thought was pretty tasty.  Was hoping for a performance or something of the sort, but was still nice.  I had the tortilla soup, good, but not memorable.  As per entrees.  I sat and looked at all the taco's over and over.  I wanted to do the mix and match of 3, but everybody else at the table was doing that.  Knew I could just poke at those.  I went for the Salmon with Manchamantel Sauce.  Never heard of it before, so what the hey.  The sauce was simple but spot on.  A kind of fruity puree with adobo sauce.  SPOT ON!  The salmon was tasty but a hair over salted.  No consistency between every body's sides.  Corn with queso fresco was awesome, plantains were pretty good.  Red chile rice and beans were good also.  They messed up on the cole slaw.  no papaya, very little pineapple.  Mostly just raw cabbage.  Have had better at crappy hot dog carts.  The sauteed greens were so salty there were barely edible.  Then dessert, OH YEAH!  Not normally my thing, but i did the restaurant week deal and nobody else did, so figured I'd share.  Mango crisp was like grandma's apple pie with Hagen Daz ice cream.  Highly recommended.  A little pricey for Mexican, but you can get out pretty cheap compared to the rest of the epicenter.  A must try if your in the area.",

    "text": "I knew this place was going to open sometime at the end of the year, but hadn't been hanging around Epicenter lately so didn't realize it was fully operational.  Now that I've moved back to the city it was time to start walking around to start getting reacquainted with the Queen city.  So the GF and I put on our coats and started walking.  I have to admit it is nice to be able to just step out 4 or 5 blocks and have a pick of bars, restaurants, art, and entertainment....but I digress. With a facade of glass, Vida is very inviting from the street.  Entering the restaurant there is dining to the left and above on a second level and to the right there is bar (also a small bar on the second level). Tonight was casual, so it was the bar.  We were also a bit hungry, so food was also in order.  The bar was busier than the restaurant, but we were able to grab some seats right by the wait station.  We had our drink orders taken and also menus for food.  Drinks came and we decided on guacamole which I had just heard earlier that day was \"to die for\" so we decided to try it out.  Now 1511 is the KING of guacamole in my opinion and with Vida pricing it at $11 and a few more dollars more than 1511 I had to see what it was all about. Chips and salsa was served, but almost after our first set of drinks were done....this was a foretelling of things to come with the bar staff and particularly our designated bartender & waiter (we'll call her Grace to protect the innocent).....more on that later.  Sorry I don't have more on the food, but I'll do the best I can with the one dish.  The chips were good and the salsa was a bit different.  Subtle which we think had to do with it being made fresh as it appeared to be though we cannot say for sure.  My beer is finished...bottle empty on the bar....and I wait for Grace to inquire to another one....and wait...and wait......  So the guacamole comes...a gentleman which is dressed as though he works in the kitchen brings the MASSIVE guac bowl.  It was huge!!!!  He saw our faces and placed the bowl down with a big thud...just to make a point which in turn we all laughed.  Then we asked about the size.  It seems Vida uses 3 avocados for their table side whereas 1511 uses only 2.  Now is that work an extra $2 to $3?  Not sure.  What I am sure about is that if you don't have a healthy appetite you'll definitely have a To-Go container full of this stuff.  My beer order is finally filled....  We eat....and eat....and eat....and eat.................and still eat.....beer gone.  Now this time Grace along with the other female bartender are standing right in front of us just talking to each other........my bottle sitting their empty continues to sit there.........and the bar staff continues to chat.  Though my career is Finance & Banking, I also have over 5 years of bartending expereience and managing a bar, so I know that you need to be on the ball to be a good bartender...to anticipate customer needs...to be one step ahead and think for your customer so they just have the experience...not think about the little things..............Grace evidently does not understand this or cares.......nor does Management watch them perform in this manner.  It's a beer I know.....but in the end it was also a $50 tab, so it is my hard earned money and I'm finding in this town there are a few number of choices.....and a belief from the owners of these places that being \"best in class\" or professional levels of service are more of a footnote than a serious consideration....sorry for the soap box, but this is a tough economy.....  Perhaps Grace is one of the many millions of Americans waiting for the job market to heat back up so they can go and get a job that pays more?????  Regardless, my money is real enough and I'd like to stretch those dollars with the best experience as possible.  Vida's bar staff was not the ones totally providing it to me that evening.  They weren't bad mind you...but then again they weren't great either.  So, back to the guacamole............we actually ALMOST finished all of it.  And one last beer....which I have to give Grace an ok here as she did get this one faster........but then again, the bar had totally cleared out with only a few people, so it wasn't so difficult for her this time.  The guacamole is very fresh....with tons of cilantro and all manner of chunks of veggies.....very good....right now a tie with 1511, though price and size make it almost in a different class.  Decor is cool and laid back with earth tones.  The floor near the bar is interesting with slices of wood embedded in it.  What cracked me up is in the men's bathroom they have a wall made out of decorative concrete blocks like one would use to find in cheap hotels from the 70s, but the application here proved to be successful.  Plenty of TVs for watching games, so a nicer hang out for games in the coming year.  All and all a \"good\" place, but I'm holding onto a few stars until I eat in the restaurant.",

    "text": "Ok so I know there are some people hating on the Vida but I've been nothing but pleased during my visits there. I am totally digging that there is another option Uptown for Mexican besides the fast food Mexican places like Salsarita's and Qdoba. Some co-workers and I went for lunch today since one  had a free guacamole coupon and  were the first ones there. After 10 minutes of being there, the dining area was almost packed so obviously this place is doing something right. We had prompt service with a friendly and knowledgeable server who gladly gave honest suggestions on what to order (seriously, request Matthew-he is wonderful!).   The rolling guac cart came around right after we had our water filled and started to go to town on the fresh made guac. I love anything that I can see being made in front of me. Served along with that were some of the freshest and warm tortilla chips I've ever had with just the right touch of salt. And the guac? I almost asked guac man for his hand in marriage since it was rich, creamy and delightful. I wanted to scrape the bottom of the bowl but didn't think that would be ok since it was a business lunch and all. Our server suggested the carnitas tacos so I had to go with that and dare I say there were the best I've had (and I'm an Arizona transplant so I like to think I know good Mexican food). I had the plantain and black bean mash with was equally as awesome. We had no problems at all and checks were given in timely manner. I left with a feeling of happiness from exceptional service, amazing food and a food baby sitting in my belly. This place is one block away from my office which is going to be way dangerous for me but also way good for me.",

But feels far from authentic Mexican.   - Cold chips with our first serving and crispy hot our second. inconsistent.  - Only one salsa dip!? LOL. Salsa fail big time.  - Server said shrimp taco was his favorite. Pretty average. Comes with Mango. Not something I'd pay $15 again for.  - Corn tastes as if were canned or maybe frozen. - Optional: order burrito fried. cool.  - Burrito is short and stubby. The ground beef reminds me of that in a Chinese egg roll.  - Service was pleasant. Great with refills. Watch it though,..\"Any more boxes, LADIES\" WTF... - Spoiled with great Mexican eats in Los Angeles and San Diego, this place taste like an over-priced Baja Fresh. City Center Charlotte will sure disappoint you when it comes to Mexican food. Chevy's would be a better alternative. haha. ouch.",

The staff are great but the food is BLAND. I'm used to Mexican food being very flavorful and I'm not even a fan of spicy and this stuff is just blah. The best part was the chips and salsa but who can screw that up? I didn't even like the queso. My only recommendation if you're forced to go here is to sit at the bar, have some drinks and chips/salsa and then run.",

I've experienced a few soggy tortillas at times, but that's just to be expected when dealing with corn tortillas. The service is always outstanding, the bartenders are always attentive and accommodating. While this is not as \"authentic\" as going to a mom and pop type of Mexican restaurant, the spin they put on it helps you indulge in the flavors of Mexico without worrying about eating too much. Aside from that, the frozen margarita has me feeling so good by the end of the meal that I can never order less than 1. Vida is definitely a staple (for me), just as long as they keep making those margaritas just right.",

    "text": "They really did a wonderful job on their grand opening.  I was quite impressed.  The service was fantastic, even with a full house and it being their first big day. They really use the space well, it's a bit oddly shaped inside (it's on a rounded corner in Epicentre).   The bar area is spacious and there are long tables to stand and enjoy cocktails at while you wait for your table.    Our server, Jackie, was very knowledgeable, nice and amusing.  She recommended the carnitas, which my boyfriend ordered.  I had the barbacoa.  She made sure our food didn't come out too close to the tableside guac.  We joined \"The Good Life\" club before going so we had a coupon for  a free tableside guacamole.  Which was MASSIVE.  I swear he use like 6 avocados!  It was very tasty and we ate so much of the yummy guac that by the time our food came I was almost full. I definitely recommend joining \"The Good Life\" and using the coupon, it's was some seriously good guac.    The barbacoa was just as barbacoa should be, tender and almost melt in your mouth.  I thought the sauce was a bit too sweet, but they didn't smother it in the sauce so it was okay.  The carnitas was definitely the better choice, it was smokey and slightly crisp.  We weren't too fond of the taco shells (they're similar to Loco Lime's) and slightly sweet.  It might just be that they're corn and that's how freshly made corn tortillas taste, but they were a little too heavy and sweet for me.  Jackie told us they come from a family business in Monroe and are brought in fresh every morning.  They are trying to use as much locally sourced products as possible.    The plantains were outstanding, i'm a huge sucker for properly done plantains, I also had the black beans and they were equally yummy.  The carnitas came with lettuce, guac and cheese and the barbacoa came with a mexican slaw which was okay, i'm not a slaw fan of any kind so i'm not the best judge.    Be forewarned, the drinks are STRONG.  I had a frozen strawberry margarita and it was very heavy on the tequila.    We had churros for dessert, which were a little too doughy in the middle for me, but the outside was perfect and they come with chocolate to dip them in.   My only complaint was the Abercrombie & Fitch music.  My boyfriend commented that he felt like he should be buying clothes not eating.  A little too club dance party for a restaurant.  I get that they're trying to be hip, but that's a bit too hip while i'm eating dinner.",

    "text": "So finally I made it back to Vida after enjoying their soft opening a while back...ole!   As others have mentioned - the decor is lovely. It's a well appointed restaurant with plenty of booths, large bar area, great patio (perfect for people watching) and sweet upstairs area for smaller groups. Our service last night was just about perfect - efficient, friendly, helpful and considerate. Case and point? Hubs and I dined with another couple, and my friend is about 7 months pregnant. When the server brought three of us our margaritas, etc. she also brought a mocktail for my buddy with baby. Sweet!   Here's my take on the food...  Guacamole: 5/5: Some of my favorite guacamole in Charlotte. It was super fresh, well made and gigantic. The four of us barely finished it. It may be more expensive than other places, but it is delicious and feeds many.   Skinny Margarita: 4/5: It is indeed a skinny margarita. I believe Vida touts this as fewer than 100 calories. It's a good margarita - especially for that caloric intake.   Chicken Enchiladas: 4/5: I thought I ordered the chicken & roasted corn enchiladas...but maybe they were just plain chicken. Regardless, they were flavorful, cheesy and filling. While some may say $14+ for enchiladas is pricey, this portion was mighty large and with the two sides I was plenty full.   Fried Plantains: 4/5: I love fried plantains. These are done right, albeit a teeny tiny bit greasy.   Corn con Queso: 3/5: It's a general ear of roasted corn with a bit of queso. Nothing to write home about, but it was fine overall.   So, overall a really solid experience at Vida. I'll be back soon...as long as I come with a reservation!",

Plenty of avocado, crunchy jicama, sweet mango chunks, and the most wonderful garlicky shrimp you've ever had. It's one of my favorite salads in Charlotte! I also really like the salsa they serve with the chips. It's got a great flavor and isn't watery like so many Mexican restaurants serve.    I just had lunch here and our server overheard my friend and I talking about her birthday. She treated us to a piece of Banana Tres Leches cake \"roasted banana tres leches with Mexican coffee creme anglaise\". I really am a sucker for tres leches but I am also very critical of it. Once you have a good one, it's hard to beat. This is not your everyday tres leches. The banana flavor is not overpowering, but is just enough to get that flavor.  The whipped cream on top had a nutmeg flavor that was so warm and delicious.  I mean, I want to go back and get another piece! It's a MUST try.",

If you check in you'll get a free queso and chips . I really liked the queso. I was pleasantly surprised at the prices especially being in the Epic Centre. One taco was about $3.50 and the combos were about $8. The tacos were big. I was satisfied with one. I ordered the buffalo chicken taco and I asked for no blue cheese. It came with blue cheese and I had to send it back. The new one took forever.  I thought the service was just so so. Our server seemed neither interested or uninterested. It was hard for me to gage her vibe. Overall, I will probably come back . I'll like to try their fish bowls.  Also, after reading other reviews I'm disappointed that we didn't receive salsa ? Is that the trade off between free queso is no salsa ? I sure wish someone would have told us.",

    "text": "Tacos were pretty good, they have a lobster roll type taco rolling for the month of August. Highly recommend but the PABG tag goes to the Carnitas taco... Spot on baby. If and when you go make sure to go on Wednesday night as they do Gay Trivia given by some fabulous guest MCs. Not only is it tasty but fairly inexpensive, the tacos are less then $3.50-$4.00 (lobster is $6.50... it's lobster.) it is a bit small but no worries they have outdoor seating. It is Uptown so the draw back is paying to park and it's near the Epicenter so if you don't want to deal with the bar crowd could put a damper on your experience but then again you are in a bar so... When you go YELP and you're a good for FREE Queso dip. Eat, Drin",

    "text": "I came here with some of my coworkers for lunch.  It took a little while for us to get service to start - meaning we had enough time to review the menu and discuss what each of us were thinking about getting.  Once we did get service, we were promptly given our drinks along with chips and salsa.  I do appreciate the fact that they brought two dishes of salsa and chips for the four of us.  While not the best salsa, it didn't stop me from eating a lot of it!  I ordered the combo with the quesadilla and the spinach and mushroom enchilada.  I appreciated the ability to order a couple different items to try, and glad I did - because I was originally just thinking of the enchilada.  The enchilada was awful.  I cannot pinpoint the exact flavor that I did not like, but it was not edible for me, so I just stuck with the quesadilla, which is hard to mess up.  It was alright to me, and at least edible.  The combo was served with rice and black beans, so plenty of food.  I probably do not see myself going back here with so many other lunch options that you can actually enjoy, but it was worth a try.",

A very cool ambiance when you walk in they have booths and tables to the left, upstairs seating and a bar and high top seating to the right. I decided to sit at the bar because we had a show to go to and usually the bar is a bit quicker. Well the bartender looked super annoyed we even sat at the bar, she barely greeted us and seemed to be in a very unpleasant mood. I ordered queso dip which when it finally did come out it was cold and the cheese had hardened as it does when it sits there for awhile. She made a good margarita not great. I ordered the steak fajita salad and my friend ordered carne asada tacos. The tacos were good. My salad was different not a traditional fajita salad but I would say a nice change I would maybe add some pico or a more flavorful dressing. My full experience was only a 2 star rating because of the service. I wouldn't mind coming back to try this place again but for sure would stay clear of that rude bartender.",

Chips were chips lol. Out of the party of 5 no one raved over their meal.  Due to the poor experience the only tips left were written notes to the waiter to DO BETTER. Well someone must not have cared for the tips much because they chose to write in a tip ($) on one of the bills which we didn't notice until the next day.

It's definitely homemade. I ordered a taco salad with ground beef. The lettuce was dressed in their homemade dressing and it gave the salad a nice flavor.

I have never had or heard of a Philly cheesesteak taco. It was mouth watering that I had to order more. The pricing is pretty high, $4 or more for a taco but it's worth it because it's packed with protein! The black beans was pretty awesome too. I also had the shrimp taco and fish taco which was nothing short of amazing as well. I gave it four stars only because like traditional Mexican restaurants it didn't come with complimentary chips and salsa, which is always a plus for eating at a Mexican restaurant. The next day I had to go back for more! The waitress was really helpful and attentive.",

The margarita tasted like it had too much sour mix and was quite sweet. For $7.99, I expect a bigger glass or a little bit of a better crafted beverage. That said, we enjoyed the DJ and busy atmosphere.    I think we will come back eventually to order some food. I'd like to see if the margaritas are better when it's less crowded, but I may order an upgraded margarita to see if that is better.

It's fresh and delicious with chunky pieces of avocado. They bring chips and salsa to the table. The salsa is also fresh with a spicy kick. No oily chips here.   For my lunch, I had two tacos. You can mix and match if you want to try different items. So I ordered the shrimp with jalapeno bacon and a shredded beef taco. It also came with beans and rice. I loved both tacos. There are amazing sauces on each one. The shrimp were plump and tasty. And the combination between the sweet mango and spicy jalapeno paired well. The shredded beef taco was seasoned very well. And the avocado poblano sauce on top was spicy and creamy.   The only thing I disliked was the seating. We were at a high top and there were no purse hooks or good places to put our coats. Other than that, I highly recommend this restaurant.",

My coworkers and I stopped by for a nice sit-down lunch, there were 6 of us.  Here is my issue. I hate to rate this place so low, as the food is decently good for the price, and the food came out quickly. Our server was absolutely awful. I am not the type to complain to management, but my friend did politely mention it to the manager. We sat for an hour and never got our drinks (we just ordered waters). One of my coworkers stepped inside and asked 2 different people if someone could bring us waters - nobody ever showed. The best people were the food runner and the manager.  I had the pork avocado enchilada and it was pretty good, although a bit too salty. The chips and salsa were good and we all enjoyed them. My friend enjoyed the house salad and another liked the beef burrito he ordered. This is not a terrible place to eat by any means, but it will certainly never be on my lunch list again.",

I made my reservations through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a> on Friday.  Saturday afternoon while I was at work, I received a voicemail from the restaurant asking that I call them back to confirm my reservation.  Naturally, I didn't get the message until 6:30 p.m.   I understand they want to ensure that they're not holding reservations for people who aren't going to show, but I like to use the online service so I don't *have* to call.  Otherwise, I'd just call to begin with, wouldn't I?  I never did call to confirm but we arrived 15 minutes ahead of our reservation time.  They still had our reservation and even seated us immediately!  We were very impressed.    Someone brought us the traditional complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa was delicious!  It had a unique flavor to it.  I think it may have been chargrilled?  I was happy to see that the menu items (drinks and entrees) were reasonably priced considering the restaurant's prime location in the Epicentre in Uptown Charlotte.  There were three different entrees that jumped out at and appealed to me (that's always a good sign for a restaurant!).  I opted for the Green Chile Brisket Tacos.   There were three tacos (more than plenty!).  Additionally, Vida offers you your choice of two side items.  I was very happy to see such unique choices on the side item menu.  Wanting to try something different, I chose the (1) ripe plantain and black bean mash and (2) grilled corn with queso fresco.  The corn was delicious; the mash was just okay.  It was a weird combination, and I think I should have just gotten one or the other by themselves.    My partner ordered the one thing on the menu that first jumped out at me:  Tortilla Pie with Poblano Cream Sauce.   I was thinking about ordering that without the listed mushrooms.  It's a good thing I didn't, because it was basically ALL mushrooms and I would have been left with just a couple of sad-looking tortillas.  If you love mushrooms, *that's* the dish for you.  It was a tortilla with layer upon layer of mushroom filling topped with another tortilla and then smothered with melted cheese.   It looked good, but wasn't for the mushroom-hater in me.    The service was great and we were in and out of there quickly, with a lot of extra time before the movie we were going to see.  The interior of the restaurant was nice, too.  It had a modern look to it; nothing \"Mexican\" about it.   I'd definitely return.",

The bar patrons were interesting and i had fun talking to them    I had the lunch special with the fish tacos and a caesar salad. Since I really like both of these dishes, I thought it wouldn't be too bad to eat them together.  The salad was alright and was better tasting than the fish tacos. I had a beer at the bar (some local brewery brand). It definitely wasn't my beer of choice ylang ylang but it helped to wash the meal down.  Btw, the chips and salsa was probably the best thing I ate there.",

My burrito was cold and, despite being advertised as \"grilled\" at most it was slapped on a flat-top grille for a quick minute.  My partner for the meal had the enchilada's which she thought were \"excellent.\"  Still, she left one on the plate, so it wasn't all that good.  As you may have read, the service was decent.  We stayed away from the alcohol drinks for the reasons you've read about.  So, all in all, I think we paid about $24 for our two dinners, which wasn't bad.  We went for the convenience (live 4 blocks away) and would probably go back.  We're informed diners thanks to fellow Yelpsters!",

I know because I've done all of that multiple times and was never disappointed.  Vida Chicken, the tacos, sandwiches are all good. Drinks are good too. Personally, wasn't so crazy about their Enchiladas but it could have been that I wasn't so hungry. I'd say the best thing about this place though, is that if you are looking for a place to eat/drink as a group in center city, and there's no consensus, this place is perfect.  Now, I must advise you to make a reservation if you are heading over for lunch on a weekday. It will be packed! If you don't you'll most likely wait. But luckily, the servers are nice so it makes up for the wait. Thanks.",

    "text": "Nice atmosphere, service and food. It is not the most authenic Mexican I have eaten but it is pretty darn good.   Their chips were fresh, light, crispy and not too much salt. Their salsa was not spicy but it was packed with flavor.   I ordered a dinner combo that came with three different kinds of enchiladas and rice topped with black beans. The star of the dish was the rice topped with black beans. I could eat that all day long if I could. The enchiladas were OK. They didn't look anything like how I pictured it in my head when I read the description on the menu. I finshed only half of each enchilda.   For my drink I had a flavored mojito. It was strong and not too sweet. If you like that sort of drink the mojito is for you. As for me, I lean towards the sweeter side so it could have used a little more simple syrup.   For dessert, I had to take it to go because I was so full. I wanted the creme brulee but the waitress said it wouldn't pack well. So I ordered the banana tres leches cake. Oh my lawdy! When I opened the container I was looking for bananas. Where were the bananas? It was soft, moist (as it should be) and was dripping nwith all the yummy goodness of all the three milks in my to-go container. It was topped with whipped cream and three different berries but the cake tasted like banana. There's the banana. It must have been a banana liquer that they put in it. It so darn good, ya'll.",

    "text": "I gave Vida 5 stars because I really can't remember any bad experiences I have had here. It's in a great busy uptown location in the Epicenter and has a great patio. Their patio overlooks the busy intersection of Trade and College and if you sit outside on a nice day, you will definitely get lots of people-watching action.   The inside decor of the restaurant is modern and fun, while the music is always upbeat but not too loud. I have sat in a booth and have also sat in the bar area as well as upstairs. If you have a choice, sit downstairs as there is not much going on upstairs. That area is mainly used for private events and opens up on the busier nights to overflow. Insider tip: Ladies, if you wear heels here, be very cautious! The weird tree-ring like floor and stairs that lead to the upper seating area are extremely slippery! Each time I wear heels in this place, I think I may cause a scene if I eat it.. but thankfully, I don't.   I have enjoyed a couple cocktails here with dinner and I would have to say that the flavored margaritas are my favorite. I have had a regular margarita, as well as their famous \"Skinny Margarita\" and I still would go with a flavored variety, but that may be because I am not a huge tequila fan to begin with. Only downside of their liquor is that it is a little expensive. You will easily pay $10 for a specialty drink.. but when in uptown...   When this place first opened I heard a few people comment that it was too expensive, but I really don't think that is the case. I think the drinks are expensive but the food is not. You could score an app for about $8 and an entree easily under $15 and they are a good size! So if you are on more of a budget, try their drink specials, grab a beer or just stick to their yummy food.   My suggestions for food: You have to order the table side guacamole! It is made at the table for you if you sit in an area where those guacamole-making-carts can fit. They now offer 2 different sizes of guacamole, which is good because while on a date after they first opened, we were served guac made with like 4 avocados or something crazy! So make sure to specify that you want the small helping if you are only dining for two.  Everything else I have had has been very delicious. The fare is new-Mexican style and tastes very fresh. Nothing tasted old or too heavy. I believe I have had certain types of tacos several times and enjoyed them each time. (I am usually too stuffed to go for a huge meal after all that guacamole and a drink or two.) I also have shared the quesadillas before and they were yum as well.   The service at Vida has always been speedy and attentive. I know a couple people who work here and they seem to enjoy it. The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. I once projected an entire champagne flute-full of Prosecco across the bar (I may have had a couple drinks before that particular one as well...) and the bartender just smiled and helped me clean up my mess. Thanks for that! =)   Parking is in the Epicenter garage (which is ridiculously expensive) and I am pretty sure that Vida cannot validate parking. If you live close enough to walk here, then do that.   If you have family visiting and would like to make a nice day of the Epicenter or uptown, I would suggest picking this spot for a fun and enjoyable treat. This is also a good casual date spot! It is nice to have a fresh, new Mexican joint with delicious food so close to us that live in Uptown!",

The service is friendly and quick, even during busy time (like brunch for Cinco de Mayo) and the portions are a healthy size to make it worth your buck.  I was seated upstairs both times I have visited, and though you get a little bit more of an intimate area, you kind of miss the buzz going on downstairs if you are looking for a scene.  Not sure if this is related to Vida or not, but while there on Cinco de Mayo, the most memorable piece for me was the DJ!  He was rocking all of my favorite 90s music, that I made a mental note to hopefully find him again!  Worth a visit if you are in the area and looking for a fair priced meal and good service.",

The server who took my order said, \"I gave you your card back\" She didn't, so I let her know that she had not given it back. She kept repeating that she had given it to me. I kept responding with, \"no you didn't.\" She then said \"I set it right here\" and pointed to the counter.  At that point I asked to speak to a manager.  The blonde manager in her 40's asked me to check my pockets. I declined saying that I was certain that it was never given back to me. She said \"you are the ones that have been drinking all day, not us\"  I said, \"mam, I was polite to you, but you just crossed a line, you're statement implies I'm at fault for this because you think I've been drinking, when in all reality your staff lost my card\"  They went to look around and came back with nothing. I logged into my account and noticed charges on the card from the same place. I called the manager over and said if she gave me my card back, how was someone able to run up charges on it?  I showed her my phone and said this is fraud and after that was the first time she started to address the situation with some urgency. She went to the bartenders and sure enough there was an open tab at the bar with my card. They claimed \"someone found it and turned it in\" and \"I was lucky to get it back\" I asked why there was an open tab with charges on my card and they began to get mad and yell. I said I wanted a refund for the charges on my card and they said \"seriously? Do you really want us to refund you $14?\" And tried to make me look stupid. I replied with yes, actually refund me 14.85 because that's the amount fraudulently charged on my card since you gave my credit card to someone else. They gave me my money back and rudely told me to \"never come back\" like I did something wrong?! Hopefully people read this and never come back.",

My husband tried the black bean plantain mash based on yelp reviews.  It was a little too sweet for the dish that he ordered.  Maybe if you ordered something very spicy & salty it would be a nice accent.  He & Dad had the tacos carnitas, and Mom had shrimp tacos. All said it was ok.  I had the cabo salad & felt there should have been more veggies (quantity wise) in the salad. I am wasn't expecting it to overpower or equal the greens, but the avocado, beans & corn felt a little stingy portion-wise vs. the greens.  Wished I would have remembered there was a restaurant at the Mint museum that we could have tried...next time",

We asked the server about theenchiladas and he told us that the plate came with 3. Well we ordered them and it came with 2 very, very small enchiladas. Certainly not worth the price of $11.

    "text": "I ate lunch here on a Friday about 11:30 am.  I beat the lunch crowd and it wasn't very busy.  They brought over chips and salsa.  For the salsa the mix it at the table to determine the heat level.  I chose medium, which for me wasn't very spicy at all.  I ordered the the carnitas plate with green chile rice for the side.  The menu on their website says that the plates come with 2 sides, but as I tried to order  2nd side, my waiter informed me that for lunch the plats only come with one side.  OK, fine.  My food came out quickly.  The carnitas were very tender and tasty with a crisp skin.  The tortillas that came with the meal were a little dry.  The green chile rice was good.  My waiter checked back once right after I got my food, but never again until I was done with my meal.  Overall the food is very good, but a bit pricey.  The service was so-so.  Probably won't be back, but that's just my choice as I can find better places to spend my $$$.",

We both lived in Southern California so our expectations for Mexican themed cuisine are high.  The made to order guacamole was sensational & the portion was more than enough for 2 single ladies.  3 women could have easily shared it as an appetizer.  I had the 3 enchiladas with plantains & she had tacos.  Both were generous proportions.  We loved hte plantains, tacos & the enchiladas.  It was so good that I took my partner who also has a high bar for Mexican style food.  We ordered the shrimp appetizer, sandwich & tacos.  All exceeded expectations again.  All portions were generous.  The shrimp appetizer the waiter had thought was only 5 shrimp.  It came out & it was 15.  The garlic cilantro sauce was sheer perfection - a great combination of flavor.  I have been trying to copy it ever since.  All in all fantastic.  Have never had to wait for a table or sit at the bar.  Have been lucky enough to get there right before rushes each time.  Loving this place and easily my new \"Mexican\" go to in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I have to say that I am very sad about my recent experience with Vida.  I went a few weeks ago and really enjoyed the black bean and plantain mash and the young lady who waited on us at the bar was really gracious and polite.  I was so excited that I got several of my colleagues to go on a Friday afternoon with me a few weeks later.  I was so DISAPPOINTED!  I understand that Friday lunches are busy, but our waiter, John, was flustered although he started out fine enough.  However, when our food came out, several times after he told us it \"was coming right up\" and I pointed out to him that my food order was incorrect, he was rude and very snappy.  Everything just seemed to go wrong from there.  One of our orders was incorrect and my friend had to wait on her food AGAIN and one colleague had to leave because the food took so long to get there.  And then to top it off, when the manager came by to check on us and we told him we were not having a good experience, he said (and I quote) \"Well, I'll just burn the place down tonight!\" and literally walked off.  Now I understand why the server was so rude.  I will not be returning to Vida.  I am not going to receive rudeness and bad service for money I work hard to earn.  And you had better believe I will let everyone know that who asks.  Such a shame, because the food is actually delicious!",

    "text": "I really love Mexican food. And the thought of having a place within walking distance of my home was a dream come True. Something I felt like Charlotte was really missing. I have visited Vida a handful of times within the last few months and the last two times have been pretty terrible.  The first of my two bad experiences was with my mom. We decided to eat at Vida on a Wednesday evening around 7pm. We were taken to the bar area and promptly thrown menus before the hostess/server took off. We wanted to ask if there was a way to sit in the dining room instead of the bar since two huge office parties were enjoying happy hour and the music was too loud for any decent conversation (With Mom, you want to be able to converse!) We had water and salsa delivered (well, thrown at us) and at that point, moving tables just seemed like a bigger deal than it should be.   Our server really seemed disinterested and due to that, I only ordered one drink (We stopped off at Wooden Vine for our night cap). All in all, not a spectacular show for the staff but the food was decent. I've always thought a lot of the menu was just like Cantina 1511.   My second bad experience happened just this past week, during a certain Mexican celebration. We went out for drinks and dinner with friends and were seated on the patio. Like any big group, things were rowdy and yes, I'm sure we were being obnoxious (What can you say? AA5 was going on and it was a loud, busy night). The GM walked over and scolded us like 5 year olds. I have no problem with him saying \"Hey, have a good time, that's what we want, just take it down a notch, cool?\" He actually said \"I have the authority to remove this group from the premises\" Really? He then proceeded to tell one person in our group that this establishment didn't need our money. No problem, Vida. I won't be spending my hard earned money with you anymore. After he scurried off, he had the server, who had no idea we even were scolded, hand off our checks. She double charged one person and lost another's' debit card. I would say it's a pretty big deal to lose a debit card around the Epicenter area.   All in all, food is decent. Guac is awesome. Staff is for the most part a complete joke and I have no problem taking my business elsewhere. I guess Vida is \"recession-proof.\" Good for them.",

I lived in LA and Houston and do know what this is supposed to look and taste like..I think the Chef should take a trip and find out how to prepare this.  My guest had fajitas which he said were so-so...and I can believe that cause they are supposed to be served sizzling on a cast iron plate!

When I ask for a table they ALWAYS say did you make a reservation, if I made a reservation I would have said, I have a reservation under so and so.  They act as if the restaurant is SOO packed, not any more packed than any other restaurant at lunch hour in uptown Charlotte.  The cheese dip is HORRIBLE, it's like the cheese dip that comes on top of onion soup, I don't want to cut my cheese dip with a knife, it's called dip..I really don't have a favorite entree, I have had multiple items there because I am agreeable to go with other coworkers.  I have gone for HH with friends and the wine and drinks are good.  I always love their guacamole.  Service is good.  Prices are too high.

The guacamole is fine, but the  tomatoes seem to have been bought prechopped in giant bags  from a mega food service company.  I ordered the mushroom enchiladas which has NO chile sauce and seemed as if they had been warmed in a microwave.  They were dry and flavorless and the mushrooms were room temperature, as if they had been cooked the day before and reheated.  The \"papaya-pineapple coleslaw\"  had no papaya and no dressing -- just dry cabbage with some shredded cilantro, a few cubes of jicama that tasted like the back of the fridge, and some sad pineapple.   My daughter, who is six, methodically picked the chicken off of her taco because it was so tough and dry that she couldn't eat it.  My husband got a vegetarian entree with black beans which was underseasoned and flavorless and which featured mostly those dreaded , bland, pre-diced tomatoes.  Had we not been the guest of a friend and on a tight schedule I would have sent most of our food back.  Don't waste your money here.  I've eaten in many upscale Mexican restaurants as well as in numerous little family run places in Mexico.  This food is not Mexican, and it's barely edible.",

I had been excited to eat at Vida since I first saw the sign that it was opening in the Epicenter.  The decor was nice and roomy, but that's pretty much it.  I can't review the table-side guacamole because they never made mine at my table.  They just threw it on my table and walked off.  It was good though.  My waiter was rude and he got my order wrong (as in he brought me the wrong thing).  By the time I had sent back my food and got the correct item, I wasn't hungry anymore, so I got it to go.  The waiter never returned to give us our check so we had to go to the manager.  What infuriated me was that there were only two couples eating in the entire restaurant and my waiter had both.  We sat first.  The waiter came up and just asked us \"whatcha ya want\" while I heard him give this professional and pre-scripted greeting to the other couple offering them specials and explaining their unique drinks and their most popular foods.  When I asked about the menu I got \"the highlighted stuff is the most popular\" in an annoyed tone.  I couldn't help but wonder if it was because they were an older couple and we were younger (my god, I'm 30!) and he thought they would tip better.  After sitting for over 20 minutes waiting for him to return, I finally got the manager.  I asked if I could please have my food that I had ordered in a to-go box, my check, and explained the inadequacies of our waiter.  She did comp our meal, which I thought was very gracious of her considering we had not asked and the restaurant is rather expensive.  After we left, a bus boy came chasing after us and asked us to come back in because the manager had one more thing for us.  The manager also gave us a $20 gift card to come back.  I'll be honest, if I had not gotten the gift card, I would not go back.  Even with the gift card, I'm still hesitant to go back there.  But kudos to a good manager, and shame on you server.  And he wasn't some teenager either, he was in his 40's.",

My entree which I have gotten there before at lunch is listed on their website for $8.99. They Charged us $16 for the same entree (which I have not paid $16 for before).  Then they charged \"21%\"- not 20% gratuity AND didn't disclose up front. On top of that they *included the tax in the gratuity* calculation. Then to make matters worse, I did the math and it was 25% gratuity even though it said \"21%\".  'Interestingly' the waiter immediately knew what the correct amount for 21% (still including the  tax!) was off the top of his head...and said he would fix it...  Unethical at every turn at this place. My bill would normally have been $11 all in, but the bill I received was for $24... more than twice the usual cost for the same food. Even when the made up tip amount was \"corrected\" it still was 21%, included tax in the tip calculation, and entree price was the inflated by 77%. Won't be going back.",

Lunch - Pork Green Chili Stew - I love shredded mexican pork and green chilies but HATED this stew.  Very little flavor and the flavor it did have was awful.    Dinner -  Tortilla Soup - Bad Surf and Turf Tacos - I thought for sure the surf and turf tacos would be delicious....how couldn't they be??  They weren't.  The flavor of the steak and lobster was good but the tacos were dry and flavorless. I had to ask for a side of chipolte crema to make the dinner edible.  (I couldn't waste it considering I spend $24 on it)   For dinner, I was with 5 other people.   Everyone thought their meal was just ok.    If you're in the mood for mexican food, go to Cantina.......or even Qdoba or Chipotle.    They don't validate parking either, in case you're wondering.",

Being vegetarian i was apprehensive about this place, but the options and taste was YUM! The portions are huge, so if you want to watch the calories and fat definitely share your entree. If you decide to make it a event with a group of friends I recommend to make reservations a week in advance, that way there is no wait and they can make the necessary accommodations for your party.",

They have a ton of tequilas to choose from and the service is always good to say the best. The one thing they seem to suffer on is the quality of the food. The chips and salsa are ok and we also tried the crab cakes which were so soft in the middle they tasted more like a mashed potato consistency. We also tried the pork tenderloin and I'll be damned if the center wasn't raw as could be. It was like it was half way cooked. We ended up sending that back and the chef said it was supposed to be that way before sending out another one (this time actually cooked) to replace the last one.",

We started the the chips/salsa, guac, and cheese dip. The quantities of the dips are big, in my opinion. Very fresh and yummy.   The friend sitting next to me got the red chicken chili chopped salad which she raved about and cleaned her plate! I got the chicken taquitos from the appetizer menu which were very tasty and the perfect portion for me..I'm \"that\" friend that will eat an entire basket of chips and be full!   In terms of drinks we tried the pear margarita, which was really yummy. The pomegranate margarita I wouldn't recommend.   Basically, I would recommend this place to anyone passing through Charlotte.

Chips weren't bad but weren't great.   Everything in my tacos was delicious. Surprisingly I think I liked the ground beef best, then the carnitas.   Everything was expensive! I read some reviews that said this place was reasonable?! No! The guac was 5.99 and it was tiny! I ate the entire thing by myself. Also the tacos are a la carte and don't come with sides... They're 3-4 dollars each, with no sides. For the quality, that was just too high... And I'd say a hungry person needs three tacos at least to be full.   I'll not be back.",

We were there for national margarita day as they were promoting specials online.  The drinks were terrible.  Tons of margarita mix and no tequila.  I would have rather paid the full price if you would have made it correctly.  So discounted drinks with half the liquor.  I ordered the taco salad and it wasn't bad.  I would eat it again.  However, our food came out cold.  Our server appeared to be new and was really struggling on the floor.  I didn't want to bother him.  He should have had some help, especially if you're going to promote the silly holiday. Not his fault he was in the weeds, the GM should have staffed a little better.  One star for cold food, poor service and terrible drinks.  Great location but not worth the hype. My recommendation to anyone reading this would be to check out Cantina 1500.  They're pretty equal in terms of pricing but Cantina is the real deal!",

Atmosphere- I loved the clean atmosphere and the views of the city were a great bonus! As car lovers we were thrilled that we were able to sit across from the Ritz and watch the valet take the nice cars out! Ate here on a Friday night so it was great to view the busy city! The popular music playing was also greatly appreciated, helping the place feel hip and fresh! Service- Loved the service! I felt like we really were valued customers! The seating was quick (about 8pm on a Friday), we were asked what our seating preferences were (yay!), and our servers were wonderful (two because we had one who was training in)!  Food- Yum! I loved the food (almost as much as Rojo!) They start you off with warm tortilla chips and salsa and it was oh so good! We also ordered their queso as an appetizer and that was a good choice! I was sad to see that they had no nachos on the menu though as I love nachos! I ordered combo plate number 4 (the vegetarian options) and substituted my sides for roasted corn (bad choice, the corn was gross. Tasted like tin.) It also came with a side salad so there was a lot of food! My boyfriend ordered the carne asada tacos and loved them! I sampled them and they were delicious! The steak was tender and flavorful! I'll be getting that next time!  Price- Reasonable! I think that mexican food like this is typically more expensive than the average town joint as it is more upscale, this fit the bill and we got a great amount of food without bank-breaking prices.",

I had an incident with the kitchen that was immediately addressed by the waitress and the manager. They did everything to correct the problem and I did leave pleased.  TVs everywhere.

    "text": "I've been to Vida multiple times and seen all iterations of service here. Lunch, dinner, brunch, special events, during the DNC. It's a prime location in the EpiCentre with a killer patio and great mezzanine. Here's the breakdown:  Bar - Two. Upstairs and downstairs. Both have relatively the same offerings. Bartenders are friendly and attentive and make up a mean margarita. Most recently, we had some killer margaritas with Cointreau Noir -- much better than standard Grand Marnier. They have a decent selection of beers, but they stick to the Mexican food-centric bottles/draughts.   Food - Incredible guac. Let me rephrase that -- I'd eat a whole meal of guac and chips and be a happy camper. I've never had anything from Vida that I wouldn't get again. I will say that my favorite time to dine is now brunch on Sunday. Try the chilequiles and thank me later. *drops mic*  Only downside that I can really comment on is the unassociated parking situation for the EpiCentre. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah....WE KNOW, Ben,\" they exclaimed and clamored exhaustively. We all know it. We all hate it. It's expensive, validated parking isn't the norm, and so on. Just buck up and pay the piper. It's worth the meal. OR, find a spot on the street post 6pm or on the weekends when it's free as well.  Vida, thanks...for everything. I can haz guacamole?",

    "text": "I love little hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints but there are times when I want more of a fine dining experience.  So with the help of the Yelp Mobile App I aimed myself at Vida.    When it comes to Mexican my standards are very high.  That's because I live in the Philadelphia area and that's Jose Garces country.  If you are a foodie you know that he is a very well-known and successful chef and also holds an Iron Chef title.  He really knows how to do Mexican and Mexican-fusion!  I've visited his restaurants many times and he was on my mind when I walked into Vida.  If you enjoy modern decor and atmosphere you will like the look and feel here.  The place is huge and is on two floors in addition to outside patio seating.  I sat at the downstairs bar.  The day of this visit it was brutally hot outside and delightfully cool inside.  My bartender was Chelsea and she was beautiful and a great conversationalist when you could get her attention. Unfortunately that was a bit of a challenge and the bar was only half full.  So my service wasn't bad but just OK.  As many others have said the margaritas here are excellent!  They are made from scratch without using the typical bottled sour mix that lesser places use.   There is something else here that is excellent and that is the guacamole.  It is OMG fresh and tasty and is paired with excellent tortilla chips.  The small size goes for $8.99 and is worth every penny.  If you stopped in for a guac and marg meal you would say five stars for sure.  I think every Mexican restaurant in the word has combination plates.  The one that I ordered had the incredibly imaginative name of COMBO 1 ($13.99). It included a chicken taco, carne asada taco, and a green chili pork and avacado enchilada.  It arrived quickly and was plated beautifully.  In a weird way I am both sad and pleased to say it was just fine.  Sad because I was hoping for more.  Pleased because there was nothing wrong with any component of my plate.  Everything was tasty but nothing was great. I've had similar combo plates in dozens of places.  My fellow Yelpers as a group give these folks three and one half stars.  In my view that is absolutely correct.  With my admittedly high standards I'm going to give them three.",

This was the absolute last straw concerning carnitas from any place that doesn't have roaches...or at least looks like it might, for me.  The \"carnitas\" here, were pulled pork.  Total fail...and they weren't seasoned very well either.    On with what's good:  The guac...as everyone else will tell you, tastes just like the guac I make at home (sans fresh jalapenos), and of course I like my own guac.  The margaritas are also great, very clean and balanced.  The service and establishment were both great.  Your hostess...not so much.    I've got to admit that I really wanted this place to be a hit.  I had a great time at an event I attended here previously, but the fact that Vida thinks that pulled pork translates into crisp carnitas is ridiculous.  FYI: Carnitas are traditionally seasoned heavily...and they are never soggy.  My three stars are based on the fact that they know how to nail a guacamole...which is easily five stars.",

I remembered from my first visit that if you sign up online for their membership program, you get the guac for free. Signed up then and there, showed my server, server asked the manager, manager said, \"No.\" I guess when their sign says that you can experience the benefits \"immediately\" that means something different. Something about a number...I got a confirmation email, but no number. After my initial visit, one of their PR staff called me to figure out what went wrong, we played phone tag, but they never followed through. As you can see, this restaurant is not a good stop for me...bummer.  I will say, the server we had this time around was very attentive and friendly and the hostesses were very nice too. However, the food was still mediocre. I don't know if even the patio or getting a number for the free guac can bring me back...",

The steak was juicy, tender and had a great grilled flavor to it.  I will say, I asked for my eggs scrambled w/cheese and received no cheese.  But other than that, everything was spectacular.  The fruit cocktail containing strawberries, watermelons, and a variety of other fruits was great and the perfect complement to the meaty steak, eggs and bacon.    I also had the chance to sample their margaritas and was truly impressed.  And of course, the Dos Equis Amber on draft might be the single greatest beer drinking experience known to mankind.    Be careful, parking can be expensive in the garages near and around the Epicenter and Vida doesn't validate parking (I know because I asked).  Overall, I must say, brunch at Vida for Cinco De Mayo was nothing short of Cinco De Amazing!",

    "text": "I find myself stopping in at Vida Vida more than this place now, but came back by recently to mix it up a bit. I have never been for lunch, only dinner, but have done everything else in between from grabbing a bucket of beer to doing a full sit down dinner with visiting family. Highlights include spot on food for each occasion, good free chips and sala, and an amazing guac dip that may have been my first real love with the food. Our most recent trip was before a show at the Blumenthal so we just came in to grab some beers and aforementioned guac. Per our recent usual, we sat at the bar for a quick service / low thrills approach, which works well for us. We ordered the large bowl of guac - big mistake as it is almost the size of your head. You can make a pretty filling meal of the chips, salsa, guac, and beer - and that is exactly what we did. On previous occasions we have ordered some other food including burritos and enchiladas, all excellent. Some menu items can be a bit pricey, but they come with a great presentation and ample portions - so take that into consideration. All in all a steady and solid option that has been a staple at the epicenter for longer than I have been in Charlotte!",

My bad...  So VIDA is a more sit-down restaurant type while it's neighbor is more casual... but still both very good!  Live and learn, but now that I've experienced the full blown Mexican kitchen and cantina... I may never go back to the casual.  J/K I live off of their lunch tacos!    Dinner here the other night was pretty amazeballs.  Just finished an amazing yoga class on the rooftop and ate here afterwards.  Needless-to-say, I was super hungry and downed my bacon jalapeno shrimp tacos in no time flat.  The side rice and black beans stood no chance as well as the plate was CLEANED!  The menu has a ton of options - we even had a friend that was on some crazy paleo + diet and the kitchen was able to accommodate after lots and lots of questions ;).  It was pretty crowded (but no wait) for a table.... I'm sure this is a good spot to go before a Knights game or going out somewhere Uptown.",

Hubs had the green chile pork entree with grilled corn and black beans.  He liked it, but felt he'd not order it again in the future.  Daughter had the beef taco and fresh fruit. The taco was a bit spicy for her, but she devoured the fresh pineapple and watermelon in between bites!  We ended dinner with the churro dessert. Yum!!!!",

(I always leave TWC arena in the mood for Mexican.) Why is that? Because it's probably one of the closest places that I can walk to haha.   I always order the same thing. Dos Equis Lager, the Queso Dip, and their combo #1. Food wise, I would give this place a 3...maybe 3.5 -- Will it be the best Mexican food you've ever had? Absolutely not. However, does it have an awesome ambiance, great decor and is it conveniently located? YES, YES, and YES.   I have only sat at the bar when I have come here. All the bartenders I've had are excellent and the food gets out to me pretty fast. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a solid bite to eat.",

It specifically states DO NOT microwave on the box - My son got a soupy (and hot-pocket-esque) mess. Was soupy and gross.

Yes, they were literally pulling their pants up high (way over the butt makes the best booty pictures?) and posing.  Mmmmhhhmmm.  Walking in the door I was hit in the face with the Manhattan club scene - Sean Paul was blasting and I could barely hear the hostess over the music and the people.    I'm good with that - I've been to plenty of Mexican restaurants that play authentic Mexican-style music, but I say there's nothing wrong with a little dance dance music while you taco up the night.  We opted for guacamole to start, which wasn't quite table side - we got a bowl of pre-chopped avocado mix with another bowl of chopped cilantro, onions, and tomatoes that was mixed in by the guy that brought it over.  Table side or not, it was still pretty good.  The thing that stood out to me the most was the salsa - we pretty much drank the stuff.  It was super smooth, and had the perfect mix of cilantro and onions.  It was the closest thing to my favorite salsa ever, handcrafted by La Carreta in Nashua, NH.  So now I can say my two favorite salsas can be found in New Hampshire and North Carolina, two places which fail to share a boarder with Mexico and probably wouldn't pop into your mind if you were asked to \"name states that makes the best salsa.\"  So far - NH, NC.  Boom.  There it is.  For food, we both opted for some type of taco, one with beef and one with chicken.  They came on a not quiet hard shell not quiet soft shell briefly fried taco deal, which was actually pretty good.  It was crunchy but still foldable.  We left full, happy, and after a day's worth of driving causing what might be referred to as mild dehydration (mixed with exhaustion)....a little tipsy (let's call it SUPER relaxed) after the second round of house margaritas, rocks, no salt.",

If that's all I had they'd have two stars, but other things made up for it.  The location is in a great spot downtown for tourists and locals alike.  The interior is spacious and open.  The bar is large and stocked with great options for tequila and such.  I started with the blood orange margarita.  It was sweet and refreshing, but a bit too sugary to have more than two.  I changed over to a Sangria swirl frozen margarita and it was a pleasant change to a more bitter drink.  It's not on the menu, so you'll have to ask for one. *PS - you can also get Sangria by the glass which is not on the menu as well.    The bartenders were also very polite and attentive!  However I feel it's unprofessional to be talking with your friends who stop by to say hi about how wasted you got the weekend before and how you gave someone a 50 instead of a 20 cause you were just to f'd up  - really can't you save that for the conversation you are going to have in a few hours when you're off work?  Just sayin'!  A tell tell sign for me if a place is worth it at all is the chips and salsa.  This place actually did a really good job with this!  The chips were crunchy, non greasy, not too thick, not too thin.  The salsa was just the right spice level with chunks of tomato and onion.  I also got the guacamole and it was spot on with pieces of avocados, white onion, jalapenos, cilantro, diced tomatoes and lime juice.   So yummy.  I'm a vegetarian so I always seek out something on the menu that suitable and the Veggie tacos sounded awesome.  But they were below par to me.  The menu states they have \"grilled Portobello mushrooms, zucchini, onions, fresh avocado, goat cheese and pico de gallo\", but mine had not a hint of a Portobello and only a few white mushrooms and if there was any goat cheese it was so minimal it went unnoticed.  They were also very greasy.  I would not get them again. Would I go here for margaritas and that guacamole again - you bet!  But I'd have to try some other veggie food dish for sure",

I saw our waitress wandering around the outdoor patio several times so I know she was free to stop and see how we were doing but she just never did.  After reading all the reviews I had to order the tableside guacomole which was quite delicious!  I was a little disappointed that they didn't actually make it at our table, but I think that was because we were sitting outside.  So if you're there for the show make sure to sit inside.  Our entrees were very disappointing.  Hubby got the carnitas tacos with pork meat in a soft wheat tortilla shell.  I tried a bite of a taco and it had zero flavor and the meat was dried out.  I ordered a cobb salad and made the mistake of not asking for my dressing on the side.  It was drenched in dressing and all the lettuce was soggy.  Gross.  Overall we paid too much money for poor service and not so great food.  I don't even think the free guacomole on the next visit will bring me back.  This makes me sad because I really wanted to like this place.  :(",

    "text": "Normally I'd say you can't go wrong with any kinda Mexican food. It's usually cheap, hearty and comforting. When it's elevated into a gourmet fine dining restaurant though; that's when things can either turn south or pan out eloquently like a Monet or maybe even a Frida Kahlo painting. Vida seems to be a hit or miss and just falls short in the execution of some dishes.   While I haven't had any issues with service, I do have one major beef with their seemingly ridiculous approach to seating. My first visit was on a Saturday night around 9:00pm. Luckily I had reservations, otherwise I might have been turned away by, ahem the bouncer. No offense to the doorman himself - he's just doing his job....but a bouncer at a restaurant? Are you serious? *suspense* I understand this place is a little clubby, but this is a bit of overkill dontcha' think?  What's the point of having a bouncer when you have hostesses? *climax* Better yet, WTF is the point of having a bouncer at a restaurant - period? *explosion* Riddle me that? I'm guess I'm just glad I was on the list.....I think.   Anywhoo, in two separate visits, I did have some issues with the food though. $24 for three (3) surf and turf tacos. Tender, medium rare beef and tiny bits of lobster. Okay it's lobster - I get it. But, at least make it worth my while. Tasty, but nothing that made me scream woohoo. The Pork Chops..Hmm I don't know how to describe them. I think distinctly non-Latin flavor works.   On my second visit, I had the fish tacos. While they were okay, they too weren't anything spectacular that I would return for. For sides, I prefer the green rice over the red. Black Bean and plantain mash, eh just okay. I had a hard time getting over the look of it though.. hehe. The grilled corn; it's kinda hard to mess up corn, but that queso slathered on top almost ruined it.   Vida isn't all bad though. The guac, another dish that isn't hard to mess up has a unanimous yummy consensus. Drinks are good; capraihina, mojitos and a decent beer selection. Not all of the tacos are overpriced, and I hear the carnitas is the thing to get. I also appreciate how the tacos are made in a traditional manner, corn tortillas, and prepared very simply with pico, cilantro and lime.   Overall the food is just average. Service has always been good for me, with the exception of the bouncer. The overall ambiance is clubby, young, posh and hip. Not a place you'd take your mom, but a pretty rad spot to impress a hot date. Just make sure she chugs a few margaritas in case the food itself doesn't impress. Either way, a place worth checking out for yourself.",

    "text": "My sister pretty much summed up our evening in her review (LeeAnn D.) but I thought I would add my take on the evening.  I found the chips, salsa and guacamole to all be excellent, to the point where I could not stop eating all of it and knew I was gonna be full for dinner!  I liked the prickly pear margarita, though I would have liked to have known it would be served up and not on the rocks.  I followed this up with the Partita margaritas and those were all very good as well.  My dinner was the tortilla pie, corn and the black bean and plantain mash.  All was good, but, my entree and corn were not served hot.  To add to the weirdness factor with the service, the guacamole maker took some and put it on a chip when he was done making it, and put it 2 inches from my face, just waiting for me to notice it!  It scared the shiz out of me when I finally saw something out of the corner of my eye!  I thought he was going to try and feed it to me!!    And also, the bar staff either needs to learn to pick up the pace or the restaurant needs to hire more staff.  We had just received a round of drinks and decided to put the order in for the next because it was taking soooo long.  Our server decided to tell us that there were 17 tickets in ahead of ours and he got in trouble for putting our other round in so soon after the previous, um okay TMI maybe??  And somehow, even though he asked me a good 3 times if I wanted another one, when everybody else got their drinks, mine wasn't there and I had to wait even longer for mine =(  Overall I think the space is nice and I liked the food and drinks, it didn't end up being crazy expensive, where it can be when multiple drinks are involved.  But the service situation needs to improve for sure!",

    "text": "I've been here twice for lunch.  By far the best thing on the menu is the guacamole, which is made table-side (I realize the table-side guac thing is such a gimmick, but, like a cat to a laser pointer, I fall for it every time).  Their house salsa is pretty good, too, and can be spiced up with chipotle per your specifications. Many pluses for the warm chips, too, which they keep coming throughout your meal. During my first visit, I had the Red Chile Chicken Chopped Salad, which was pretty good.  Second time, on a friend's recommendation, I had the Carnitas Tacos but they were a miss--not served hot enough and not that flavorful.   Vida is in a great location, right in the Epicenter, so seemingly accessible to everyone working in the Uptown area. The restaurant itself has a great vibe--lively but not too noisy.  I've had good service here, too. The hostesses have seated us pretty quickly even though we always come right during the lunch rush, and the table service has been good.  My main issue with Vida is that, both times for lunch, I ended up dropping around $20.  I think it is the guac (the aforementioned 'best thing on the menu') that is the killer, but, nonetheless, I think that is too much to pay for lunch.  Drop the prices a bit, Vida, and I'll be back for more.",

This place got very busy very quick! Our reservation was for 5:45 we checked in and then just stood there no one made any moves! I finally walked to the side and we waited about 5 mins and then were brought to the worst table in the place...the booth right by the door, with the crowds of people and the chill from outside, not gonna happen! I asked to be moved they had a whole restaurant full of tables that were empty, they put us right behind the 1st booth they tried to give us...  Free Guacamole compliments to my sister for printing this coupon up!! Guacamole was HUGE and very tasty my sister hates cilantro so we had it without...she ruins everything!!  They make it table side and while putting on his latex gloves asked \"who would like and exam\" sooooo creepy! Now don't get me wrong I am not that stuck up and do have a sense of humor, but it was totally out of left field!! CREEPY!  Moving on to dinner I had the Shrimp taco's the shrimp were cold unfortunately but we had no time to waste since we had a show to catch, I ate them. It had come with Sweet Plantains and Grilled Corn, the Plantains were good and the Grilled corn was served cold just like my shrimp, but had the potential of being good.  I Like to drink, like A lot!! So we tried a number of the drinks they offered. Starting with the Skinny Girl Margarita- only served Up which to me is weird because its much easier to do it over ice, but fine! Then I had the Sangria-red I hadn't read the description before ordering it thinking that it would be like every other Sangria I've ever drank, WRONG this is served with Tequila in it!! It was gross why put Tequila with wine? why??? I Chugged that down because our server was no where to be found and I was gonna have to pay for it! * Pinch Nose and Chug* then moved on to the Prickly Pear Margarita no salt or sugar please....or not! Not my favorite either it was a different kind of sour it was just ok. Moved on to a regular Margarita NO SALT please...or not! It was fine can't really re-invent it so I had two!!   Service was awkward all through the night! Never mind the \"Guacamole Guy\", but it was everyone that approached our table. It was like it was everyones first night serving EVER! I know our server wasn't young probably 30's and it was as if he has never done this before. I know they just opened, but not yesterday and it seemed from the minute we got there it was a Cluster F*!@ (sorry but it was). I may come back but I'm in no rush to do so.",

When the ceremony ran long, snow was falling, and traffic was miserable, I called ahead to the restaurant. The girl who answered the phone seemed genuinely happy to accommodate us 45 minutes later than planned.  Upon our arrival, we were immediately seated. I had also brought along some personalized graduation cupcakes (which I'd gotten permission for in advance when making my reservations). The hostess offered to keep them in the back, in the frig if necessary, and deliver them to our table following our meal. The dessert delivery happened without me needing to remind anyone.  Tableside guacamole was terrific! I've had this several other places but Vida's is the best in my opinion. The generous serving size was plenty for our table of 8.   Heard nothing but positive food reviews from everyone we dined with - some got lunch, while others got brunch.   Service was good. Drink refills could have been a little faster. We had two servers (one in training, perhaps?) - they were both very friendly, and offered meal suggestions.  Several of us agreed we'd be back. I'd like to go back to sample one (or two!) of the many tequilas they had on their menu.  My only reason for withholding the 5th star - paid parking at the EpiCentre garage.",

But when the food is bad, it is bad. The chicken quesadilla was bland and soggy and the corn sides were equally disappointing. The Caesar salad was subpar. The only redeeming dish was the crab nachos. It was loaded with cheese, tomatoes and crab; however, the dish still was not that great. Worst of all were the prices that the restaurant demands for the food. Sad times for Mexican food.",

    "text": "I went here on a whim while waiting for the train station to clear out- it was packed after Disney on Ice.   I was greeted instantly at the bar and given a drink menu. I got a Skinny Margarita- very good. Their tequila selection alone takes up 2 of the 6 drink menu pages.  The menu selections were a little limited, in my opinion. I just wanted something quick, but if I came here for dinner I would want some more options. I went with the Lime Shrimp Salad.   They brought out chips and salsa for me while I waited. The salsa was excellent, there was a little something extra in it, a rich bold flavor. I kept trying to figure out what it was but couldn't put my finger on it. The chips came out in a deep metal bowl with high sides- it kind of looked like a mixing bowl. I thought that was a little weird, like they ran out of bowls and just had to grab something quick.  My salad took a little bit longer than I would have expected a salad to take, but right when I was about to ask about it, it came out, so no big deal. Forgive the squealing but it was SO PRETTY, very nicely plated. I considered taking a phone picture of it for a moment, but then I was too hungry to wait.   The salad was excellent- lettuce, mangoes, avocados, a very light cilantro dressing, and of course the shrimp, which were well-seasoned.   I think the menu is slightly over-priced, but I guess that's to be expected for the location, but it's not outrageous. I probably won't be dropping by every day after work for $10 margaritas, but I'll be back for a nice dinner.",

I also have tried the carne asada quesadillas and tacos, the corn queso fresco (side item and it's ah mazing) as well as the shrimp and fish tacos w rice and the 2nd time, plantains. All very awesome with little or no grease (you know how mexican food can be...)  The atmosphere is inviting with a funky \"wooden\" floor you will have to see for yourself. 2 thumbs up on the sangria, it definitely lacks that awful \"sangria bitterness\" and that is why it tastes sooo much better than most places.  Staff needs a little more training, but I respect the fact that its all so new. On another note, they are super friendly and timely.

    "text": "I'm typically not a fan of the food at EpiCentre, but while entertaining out of town guests I decided to organize a dinner here.  The restaurant location is interesting - it faces the Ritz Carlton and has a big patio that would be fun if the weather were warmer. The bar scene looks very active and the restaurant overall has a fun, loud vibe.   We were seated fairly quickly and had two waiters due to our group size. The menu is a fair amount of mexican standards along with some tex-mex and bbq thrown in. A lot of options to satisfy carnivores and vegans alike.  We ordered a variety of appetizers in addition to the standard chips and salsa, which were quite good. The guac, as others have stated, was excellent and a very generous serving (easily serves 3-4). The queso is also solid.  For dinner I chose the pork and green chile stew - this is a dish that I have loved ever since having it Scottsdale AZ years ago. The slow cooked pork, enveloped in a creamy green chile sauce, is just about the perfect meal (for me). This rendition was excellent and among the best I've had. The side of black bean/platain mash is also really tasty (if you ignore how it looks). Others at the table had the carne asada (thumbs up) the orange chipotle ribs (judged average) and the grilled dish (thumbs up).  Overall this is a good addition to the mexican food scene in Charlotte- a notch bellow Cantina 1511, but better than the plethora of places that have opened around South Park.",

The decor is very modern, clean lines, nice layout, full bar, plenty of seating in the bar area and generous porch seating that over looks the intersection of Trade & College.  Perfect for people watching.  Although the salsa is very fresh it has the consistency of apple sauce and it is very bland.  We thought we had observed some people requesting additional seasoning in theirs but we could not catch our waitress at the bar.  For some reason there was only one bar tender serving 15-20 people ordering lunch at the bar as well as preparing all the other drinks for lunch hour.  I ordered the chicken & corn enchilada.   It was delightfully different that the typical enchilada covered in cheese and red sauce.  My husband order the tacos.  He asked for one pork and one brisket.  The waitress didn't hear him so they brought out two brisket.  Upon request they promptly brought out a pork taco.  He said the pork was better than the brisket.    Unfortunately, we felt a little put off when we got the bill and they charged us for the extra taco.  Some how we paid for their mistake?  The sides of beans & spinach were also a little bland but it is nice to have your not so typical side selections to choose from.  They guy next to us got an ear of corn.  It seems they changed the music since opening night.  It was more mellow and fit the ambiance of the restaurant.  However, since they weren't properly staffed it took a solid hour for lunch.  This is simply too long for a working lunch hour to compete with other service in the area.",

    "text": "Vida is what I would consider 'All form, less substance'.  Heres why...  Pros 1. Great location at the Epicentre; one of the hottest spots in all of the city 2. Well dressed, very attractive host staff 3. Excellent interior decorations, wood flooring, and table settings 4. Well trained , courteous wait staff   Cons 1. Premium price for average quality ingredients 2. No plating whatsoever  3. Generally poor menu selection.  A lot of noise with the most basic items being their best dishes (such as the fajitas)  Other The tableside guac I found to be a bit lacking but that may be due to the fact that everyone was hyping it so much.  To me, I would eat the guac from Cantina 1511 everyday , but this stuff did not hit the mark.  If you want a real recipe of what I do at home (and probably closer to what Cantina does) message me and I'll be happy to share it with you.  I did enjoy the service and ambiance, but only went its supporting great food does it compel me to come back again.  I am at the point now where I would not actively suggest this to friends, but I would join a group if they had decided to go.  If you do decide to make the trip to uptown, I would recommend something basic as the tacos or fajitas; skip the carnitas and barbacoa at least the first time.  Hope you have a better time than me!",

I want to make sure nobody comes here and wastes their money. The only thing good about this place is their location and their patio. The food runs anywhere from $9-13 for three tacos and two measly sides. The night was very nice, so we decided to check out VIDA and sit on the patio. The busy intersection is nice and excellent back drop. We placed our orders and thought the food would be excellent, especially at prices of $9-13 for tacos. Well the fish tacos had fried fish that seems like something from a cafeteria, and the steak tacos had two very small pieces of steak and was extremely greasy. I literally felt like I was robbed. DO NOT waste your money here. Only go here for the Monday night drink specials. Tacobell's food A+ compared to VIDA.",

John, our waiter who was GREAT, brought us salsa and chips that were really fresh and still warm- YUM. I had the grilled shrimp tacos as the main entree and they were alright. I think the main reason why I'm giving Vida five stars is because of the service: we were waiting for a friend who ended up not arriving until after closing (10 PM). We didn't know that she would also be bringing two more people with her. John gave us no problem at all. He was very courteous even though we ended up staying until past 11 PM. Overall, it was a great first experience here! I would definitely recommend it.",

Yes the restaurant had been operating for only 8 months when we went, but these aren't kinks. These are long term food and managerial problems.   The only highlight was from the pleasant hostess who recommended other good restaurants in the area before we were seated. Perhaps she was trying to secretly tell us to eat elsewhere.

    "text": "I'm staying at the omni hotel next door to this place and decided to give it a try.  I walked in and placed a to go order.  After waiting around outside for about 10 minutes, I came back in to see a bag waiting on the back of the greeter's station.  I nodded at the lady who took my order and she smiled back at me.  Then I sat at the bar - assuming the mystery back was some other lucky diner's property.  Three ladies and a man stood idly by at the greeter's station as I waited at the bar. The restless employees chatted, and hopped around looking alternatively interested in each other or just completely bored.  One, then two bartenders asked if I needed a drink.  I said \"no, I'm just waiting for a to go order,\"  as the girl who placed my order twisted her hair and batted eyelashes with a fellow employee.  After about 5 minutes of hair twisting, eyelash batting and what might have been the prologue scenes of a poorly acted porn, she looked at the bag behind her, pulled it from the shelf and examined the ticket.  Then she looked directly at me.  I hopped down from my barstool and came to get the bag: \"That's mine? Really?\"  \"Yes!\" she said in a chipper voice, acting as if the kitchen was super quick.  \"Wow, because the four of you have just been sitting there chatting and having such a grand old time - I figured that bag had been waiting for someone else. It's been up there forever.\"  Stunned, her mouth was agape. I took the bag and looked at her sincerely: \"You're doing a great job!\"  Ugh.  On to the food: I had the ceviche cocktail which was properly cold and spiced nicely but a little oversauced. Raw jalapenos would be a nice addition, but with the volume of sauce you can't taste the seafood.  My to-go order was well-packaged and labeled - and included a generous portion of chips & salsa.  The chips were \"so so\" regular fare: nothing special - not thin, but not too thick. They could easily be a bulk food purchase. I'd be surprised if they were house made.  The plasticware included one bunched up undersized napkin and exactly one salt and pepper packet - just like your average airline.  Two sets were oddly included in the bag.  While the ceviche was at a reasonable temperature, the Chicken Tinga was not.  The over-easy egg atop the chicken was a congealed mess by the time I opened the container and the rice was tepid.  Again - the sauce was everywhere.  Nice flavor but EVERYWHERE.  I didn't know chicken could swim.  The 4-5 presliced pieces of chicken breast were drowning in a lovely and flavorful sauce.  It was like eating one of those frozen nuke meals with slightly nicer spices. Chicken Tenga is usually done with shredded chicken - much like carnitas.  The rice was cold and flavorless as was the grill-marked flour tortilla served with the meal.  This might be a hip and trendy atmosphere and a nice bar, but the food and service leave a lot to be desired.  I would have rated only one star, but just the idea of some of the food items - even if poorly executed - is worthy of an extra.  Good luck on the porno-bound service staff.  It will be a sweet trick if this lasts more than a year.",

    "text": "This would have been a 1-star review with me vowing to never return here if it weren't for two wonderful people at Vida Cantina - April (our waitress) and Sean (the Manager).    The waiter that we had initially took down our whole order and even agreed enthusiastically to help us split the guacomole with my portion having onions and my friend's having none. Then we waited. And we waited. No water, no salsa or chips and no sign of our waiter again. Then suddenly we had April coming over to say that she would be taking over as the other waiter was about to leave. We were there for nearly an hour and kept seeing our 1st waiter hanging around even when we were leaving. What had been the real reason for the handoff we never found out, but we were puzzled and annoyed by this.   Blame it on miscommunication in the handoff but our guacomole arrived with onions in it. When my friend complained about it, April quickly apologized for it and offered to get a fresh bowl - which she did quickly enough - and brought out onions on the side for me. But think the chef wasn't very happy - our new bowl of guacomole was more like guacomole flavored salt! I was so hungry that I ate it despite the salt and we really didn't want to complain a second time.  Our main course arrived and I could see immediately that my friend wasn't happy about it. She was picking at it and apparently it had onions in it. I guess that the fact that she hated onions was also lost in the handoff. April noticed it, much to her credit, and came around to ask my friend what was wrong. She immediately apologized and offered to swap with a new plate free of onions. She whisked off the old plate and quickly got a new one. But my friend found the new one terribly spicy. By then it sounded to me as if the waitress was terrific but the chefs spiteful.   I liked my main course (chicken fajitas) well enough and ate well. But my friend was miserable and that put a dampener on our spirits. And we kept getting angry over our original waiter (Alex?) who was still hanging around and probably responsible for the whole mess.   We were wondering if we should ever come back! We both agreed that April had been as nice as we could have wished for, but the overall experience was still terrible.  Then we had the manager, Sean, turn up at our table and introduce himself. He apologized for everything and said that he was sorry that we had a bad experience and \"trust me, we aren't always like this!\". My friend had dined there before once and had a great time. She told him exactly that and why she was disappointed this time. He said \"that is why I'd like this meal to be on me!\". We were floored. The whole meal! Not just taking the offending items off the bill, but the whole meal! That was tremendous customer service.   Sean asked my friend if he could get us both anything else. My friend didn't want another entree to replace hers and I had nothing to complain about mine to begin with. We finally got some dessert (my friend did and I shared) and was surprised that even that was on the house!  Thanks to Sean and April, we are convinced that we need to go back to Vida Cantina and give them another chance. The customer service alone turned what could have ended as a one-star experience to 4-stars (I am not giving it 5-stars only because we have yet to go back and have a truly delightful experience start to end).",

My other daughter had combo #2 out of their combo choices which is crab and shrimp enchilada, beer battered fish taco and cheese quesadilla . Out of the combo, the only thing she enjoyed was the quesadilla and didn't care much about the fish taco .  Honestly , spending about 50 dollars for lunch for three people and not enjoying it was a big disappointment specially that the restaurant is located in the heart of  downtown Charlotte .",

    "text": "First, I walked in with my husband and three 11 year olds, and the hostess asked me if I had a reservation.  ???? For a Mexican Restaurant ????  We had just attended the International Festival, and wanted to treat our children to a trip downtown for dinner.  We chose this because most kids like Mexican food, it was convenient to the parking garage, and we were trying to beat the convention crowd.  We ordered cheese dip, and none of my children liked it because it had a \"meat flavor\" - ham I think - YUCK!  Secondly, the hostess said they didn't have a children's menu printed, but had one that the waitress could tell us about.  Our waitress didn't know anything about it.  She told us that our children would have to order off the menu.  They only wanted a chicken enchilada, and a cheese enchilada - but this kitchen/cantina would not prepare it.  My daughter was in tears because there was nothing she could eat.!  When I ordered, I tried to order a bean quesadilla, but the waitress said I couldn't, that beans came on the side, so I said okay, and ordered chicken in the quesadilla.  She then told me \"You also get two sides with that.\"  I told her that sounded like a lot of food in addition to the rice and beans - she gives me a smile. ~ Well, the rice and beans never made it.  I ended up with the two additional sides that I ordered!  The salsa was way too hot.  It even burned my tongue, and they didn't offer a mild salsa for children. The chips and salsa are served in small bowls.  There's not enough there for 5 people, and even when we ordered the side of cheese dip, no additional chips were brought.  We had to ask for more, and we still had more cheese dip (or whatever it was) than we had chips.  The food was tasteless, and we ended up paying almost $90 for 3 entrees, 1 cheese dip, 3 sodas, 2 margaritas, and 1 beer.  Something that should have only cost  $45 - $50.  And that is a stretch for Mexican food which is cheap to prepare. Also the margaritas were served in whiskey tumblers - less than what you get for the price at a REAL Mexican restaurant - they were good though, and that is the only good thing I have to say about this restaurant's food/drink.  If you want a place to go for a few drinks with friends, this is happening, but not a good choice for dinner - especially if you have kids with you.  Way overpriced, and poor food quality.  We will not return.",
