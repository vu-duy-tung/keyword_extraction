    "text": "I wanted to like it, but it fell flat.   First of all I told the girl who answered the phone what size (a large) and what toppings we wanted on our pizza. She responded by asking me if I wanted an extra large or a Super. I restated that I wanted a large, then she asked what I wanted on it, apparently not catching any of what I said. We ordered 2 toppings, nothing fancy.  The crust was undercooked. A big no no when you've got thin crust pizza, It needs to be cooked to stand up to toppings. Also there is a delicate balance when it comes to how much sauce, cheese, additional toppings on a thin crust in particular.  There was just way too much everything. The pizza was heavy and soggy. The flavor itself was alright. I'd give it a C+, but the undercooked crust and too much topping made this pizza an overall disappointment.   I've heard people say that it's better if you eat in. Perhaps I would try it again, but the lack of good customer service plus crappy pizza was disappointing.",

The pies are big but way over priced.  Their sauce is borderline horrible!  We ordered a chicken parm hero and got a deep fried chicken breast with no seasoning on some soggy bread and tasteless sauce.  I will prob continue to go there for the pizza on occasion but I wouldn't recommend anything else.",

I miss the Luigi's that used to be in Dilworth, right next to the Teeter on East Blvd. I miss their giant, cheesy slices with just the right amount of grease and crispity crunchity crust. When Luigi's left their spot in Dilworth, I think I shed at least a few tears. But alas, here's how it went down last weekend when we were driving around Steele Creek...  Hubs: \"So, you're hungry, right - what are you in the mood for?\" Me: \"Mmm, I don't know. Something quick would probably be best.\" Hubs: \"K, how about Chick-Fil-A?\" Me: \"Ehhh, no. I'd love a big ole slice of pizza. Let me get out my Yelp app.\" Me: \"Stop the car, I see Luigi's! Done. Pizza. Thanks.\"  I popped right in, grabbed a slice o' cheese to go for $2.25, a cup for water and stuffed my face while we made our way back north.   A few things to note about this location:  1) There is quite a bit of seating, and naturally, kiddos love pizza. Lots of seats, lots of pizza, lots of kids. Just sayin'.  2) If you want a side of anything with your 'za (ranch, marinara, etc.) expect to pay for it. Literally. A side of ranch (requested by another patron) was $.50. While I understand the need to cover costs, it seems a bit silly (until people start abusing it, I suppose).  3) Don't even think about trying to scam soda into your water cup. You shouldn't be doing it anyway (just buy the damn soda if you want one), but there is a big, bright sign that threatens back payment if the Luigi's staff sees soda in your clear cup. Again - a bit of overkill, but I get it.   Luigi's - please come back to Dilworth or South End or somewhere closer to Uptown so I can further stuff my face with your delicious slices!",

The garlic knots have a good flavor but the texture however was kinda spongy. Now let's talk about the pizza, it is so bland! I can't even taste the sauce nor the cheese. It kinda reminds me of the pizza from my middle school cafeteria,which it also taste a slightly better than this place.  I would not return. sorry !",

Myself and my significant other  was on a hunt for a really good pizza so we decided to try this place out. I ordered over the phone for a pick up and they informed me it would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. My daughter and myself went in to pick it up. When we came in a guy behind the counter jokingly stated (laughing) hey what type of fur is that you have on? I replied and smiled its a rabbit fur! He laughed and said hey i didn't know their were black rabbits as he laughed and ran to the back and said hold on let me go ask someone in the back i have no clue who the guy was from the back if he was the cook or what i really don't know, he then came up in the front with the other guy laughing again jokingly mam there is no such thing as a black rabbit, again i replied yes they definitely exist. It was all fun and games until he then stated where in Africa?? So black rabbits in Africa?  Whoa, no longer was anything funny to me anymore once that statement was made i then told myself let me sign this receipt so i can get out of here, so my daughter apparently the entire time this was going on took it upon herself to show him pictures of black rabbits so in awe and shock he stated as we were going out the door oh well they look good for a black rabbit?? Oh boy i am just so appalled by all of this! When i came home i was telling my significant other about it and he to was upset about all this taking place and excuse my french but it is no way in hell he could not know the things he was saying was very offensive and pretty much racial slurs, in the way he referenced and comparing a black rabbit must be in Africa as well as the comment about oh well that looks good to be a black rabbit. So much more happened from my significant other calling to ask about this entire situation and the guy on the phone who stated  he is  the owner/manager of Luigi's, how you as a  Manager/Owner of an establishment would allow everything that happened last night to happen and or take place. With all of this being said i hate this even happened i can't even give an actual review on how the pizza taste because we threw the pizza away because we were all in such disgust!!!!",

That is why it's nice to, every once in a while, stumble upon a good pizza joint in a state not named New York.  Luigi's makes pretty good pizza. The crust is not too thick and not too thin. The sauce is okay.  The amount of cheese is impressive- however, the consistency (too gooey- not enough elasticity) tells me it may not be real whole milk mozzarella.  The prices are good and the pies are enormous. A small pie is equivalent to some large pies at other establishments.   Overall- good and satisfying pizza. And from a place NOT located in NY!",

As a far as the pizza is concerned, Luigi's is good.  There isn't anything uber special or unique about their dough or sauce.  They have the typical varieties and they bake the pies just the way I like them.    The only challenge I've ever had with them was with their side condiments.  They had red peppers and parmesian cheese on the tables but didn't offer or provide to go packets.  I love my red peppers and not having them definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.  Will I go back? Sure. It is next door to my favorite watering hole.",

We were all dumbfounded to know there was no alfredo nor a la vodka pasta dishes, not even beef patties available.  They only had spaghetti and meatballs and baked ziti, couldnt add chicken to it. The dishes were also in the small to-go plates not the large ones and that was a disspointment as well. For the price id expect. The large to-go plate.  In the past we ordered a pie with extra cheese.  But the extra cheese.....i dont know where they get the idea extra cheese means sprinkle a little something in the center. But again...if your going to represent a ny pizzeria then please provide as such. Extra cheese means.....extra cheese. The pizza should be white.   The pizza tastes good..however 9 times of 10 its a soggy pizza. I dont know why i keep going back. Its just close by.  But if you have a chance to go to Lorenzos in ballantyne. Then you will see what i mean. Business is business but its frustrating as a customer to walk in to a ny style pizzeria and not have the same menu options nor quality. And yes im from brooklyn,ny.",

I had my niece visiting from out of town and she's never experienced authentic Italian pizza, so I had to delight her taste buds.  She was stunned at the size of this 20\" pie! Before it was delivered to the table, she was pretty sure she'd consume four slices! She made it through 1 1/4 slices.  The prices are reasonable. For the pizza (xtra cheese added) , two bottled waters and one fountain drink, my total was 27.00.  That fed 3 with leftovers! (winning)  Highly recommended!",

I arrived 30 minutes later and returned most of the veggie pizza and the replacement pizza he showed me was floppy and didn't look appealing. I asked for my money back and he said no. He was aggressive and loud and was insulted I didn't like his pizza. I reacted poorly to his aggressiveness and gave him the bird and left.",

However, ordering pick up is almost as easy as delivery because they stick to the quoted time exactly. Every time I order they quote me 15 minutes and my order has often time been ready at 15 minutes on the dot from the time my phone call ends. Sometimes the pizza is ready earlier, though never late. That is the sign of an efficient restaurant! The pizza is always hot and delicious and the personal pizza is way more than enough for one meal. They also have ginormous calzones and stromboli. I love their tiramisu! Everything we have tried there is so delicious they are worth the drive, even when I feel like being lazy and ordering delivery.",

Along those same lines they need to be able to have the toppings that they prepare be more uniform . If onions or peppers are added the veggies should be chopped or diced so that the pizza isn't \"chunk heavy\" with big clunky veggies.
