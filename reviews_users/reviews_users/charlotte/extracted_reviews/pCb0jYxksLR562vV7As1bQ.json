    "text": "Until today, I hadn't been here in years. Since the widening of Independence Blvd has forced so many other businesses to close or move, I half expected Chris'  to be boarded up, too.  From the looks of the lunch crowd on a Tuesday, they haven't got anything to worry about. Got there at 12:30 and moved into a just-vacated table (seats still warm). Only seats in the place.  I had pastrami on rye with potato salad. Wife had egg salad and slaw. I would have liked a little more sandwich, but she almost couldn't finish hers.  My pastrami was as good as can be expected without going to a full-kosher NY deli (which is an unfair comparison in CLT NC, I admit). Rye was fresh, with that chewy crust (same caveats apply as with the pastrami). Mustard was spicy enough. Potato salad was good, if suspiciously like something scooped out of a restaurant supply tub.  Wife raved about her egg salad. She's something of a slaw-snob, and she was impressed. I didn't try it (didn't get a chance, it disappeared so fast), but it looked good.  Pickle spears were worth an honorable mention. Next time, they'll be ordered as an appetizer.  Waitresses were great, in a \"we can tell you're not a regular\" sort of way. Helpful and talkative.  Note: the restaurant is on the **inbound** side of Independence, before Briar Creek. Since crossing over isn't allowed along that part of the highway, plan your route accordingly,.  If you're one of those folks who has to eat in a brightly-lit, corporate, tastefully decorated environment, keep on driving. There are Jason's, Subway, etc outlets further out Independence. This place is dim and well used. You can tell that in an earlier time, the cigarette smoke would have been thick and pervasive in there.  All in all. My kind of place. The next time I'm on that side of the world, this is where I'll be.",

This place rocks when it comes to consistency I frequent here often for lunch..you can always get a seat and the waiters are friendly. You can order your sub hot or cold on all different types of breads or rolls (onion roll highly recommended). Deli meat is cut fresh big PLUS.

    "text": "Since moving to CLT from the NY/NJ area I have been on the hunt for a good pastrami sandwich.  My wife and I tried this place based on the reviews.  Overall, the other reviewers were fair in terms of the ambience - it is a small, down home eatery anchoring a strip mall.  This was not a concern for us, but if you are looking for a gourmet deli with an upscale feel, this is probably not the place for you.  We purposely went late afternoon to avoid the lunch crowd.  The menu offers a pretty good selection of deli favorites at great prices.  To their credit, the service was outstanding as our waitress was very attentive and made our dining experience ejoyable.  We started with the chicken and rice soup, which was nothing to rave about.  I found it to be a little bland for my taste and the chicken was kind of mushy.  However, my wife seemed to enjoy it more than I did.  I had the pastrami on rye with a side of coleslaw.  The pastrami was lean and tasty and they were not stingy with the serving of meat.  The bread for my sandwich left a whole lot to be desired as it was soggy and stuck to the meat when I received it (I am guessing this was from the steam).  The slaw was decent.  My wife had the steak sandwhich with potato salad on the side, which she enjoyed.  Despite some of the execution issues with my dishes, I would consider trying it again based on the service and prices.",

    "text": "First off let me start by saying I am a sandwich fan. Morning,  noon and night, 24/7/365 if you ask me if I'd like a sandwich the answer will be a resounding YES. That being said, while they had plenty of sandwich options, with breads to choose from, the food was mediocre at best. The service was terrible, I actually had to get up to find my server to order dessert, an eclair; such was still frozen in there center and my server did not wash her hands before grabbing. The one redeeming quality of this run down. hole in the wall was the potato salad. It was heavenly. Not worth going back to the dirty table, hair on my soda can, and horrible service, but noteworthy regardless. If you are in need of a quick sandwich to go maybe you will have better luck than I did.  FAIR WARNING YELPERS:  Please be careful with your reviews of this place! I received a very nasty email from the \"owner\" of this place about my review. After ignoring my comments on bad service he flew into accusing my I must have been paid to write a bad review. Then was told I should pursue a career in law based on the fact I couldn't tell the truth and telling me if I wouldn't talk to him he had the right to refuse me service on future visits. After explaining my review wad based only on my visit, and offering an apology for my harsh review, he gave me his number to call and \"fix the problem\". Ewwww, no. You cant call me a liar and then lets fix it? No thanks. Key points, I have never returned since my original visit, and wasnt ever planning to. Maybe with a more customer friendly attitude, I would have been happy to give this place another shot and change my review. If a customer complains, maybe try to fix the problem? Just thought I should warn other yelpers before your message box is harassed with nasty messages. I'd post the screenshot,  of the messages; but I figured the way he chose to respond was embarassing for him enough the first time. I wish I could have liked the place, but pigs will fly before I subject myself to such bad service again, at least now I know why my server was so horrible; you are your establishment it seems.",

    "text": "Catching up on reviews. Chris's has been around awhile now. I would think most know how good this deli is.  All the construction on Ind Blvd/74 has killed most businesses in that area. Yet Chris's still thrives and is as good as ever. Harder to get to then years ago, but well worth the effort.  The fact the construction has killed so many businesses in that area, yet they are still packed at lunch, is all you need to know.  If they laid down a mile of hot coals you had to walk thru to get there, it would be worth burning your feet to eat there.  It was one of the best deli's in Charlotte years ago and it still is.   I would list some of my fav's, but I wouldnt know where to begin. Everything is terrific.  My fav is Corned beef and pastrami with swiss and mustard on NY rye. Its fantastic. Great meat, terrific rye, thick and hearty, priced right.  My biggest problem with this place is getting there and trying to decide what I want.....  You simply cant go wrong...its all good. Easily one of the top few deli's around. Worth walking thru hot coals to get there if need be.  If you haven't tried this place your missing out. If you are trying it for the first time, beware....You will probably be eating there on a regular basis, even if you work far away. Its well worth the drive.....  Dont believe me however. Go there, try it and form your own opinion.",

It's like your grandma used to make... really, it's super yummy!  It's so good in fact that they regularly run out, so you have to get there after 5pm but before 8pm or you'll miss out!    They also make the best greek salads, complete with super tasty, high quality feta cheese, tasty olives and spices with a very good house greek dressing.  If you're more of a chef salad fan, they do a mean chef salad as well!  The reuben is fantastic and like a reuben should be done on quality rye bread.  They offer a marinated chicken breast plate with a salad that just can't be beat if you're trying to eat healthy.  Of course they do all sorts of delicious deli sandwiches, made to order and served quickly.  My personal favorite side dish is their potato salad... it's really really good  :-) Oh yea- and they seem to have some sort of secret hookup with an amazing tomato guy- their tomatoes are delicious- they never go into the refrigerator either so they taste just like they came off the vine!   We moved away from the Independence area and we miss Chris' Deli.  We now try to plan our trips to that side of town to include a stop at Chris' for dinner  :-)",

It will blow any other deli out of the water in taste, quality, and cost. Seriously I can't rave about it enough. I love that you can by everything by the pint/quart as well. Seriously I'm going to have to go this weekend now lol.  The only downside is it's hard to get to since Independence underwent all the changes it has over the years.  Many many businesses have had to close up shop along that strip but Chris' Deli prevails!! *thank goodness*  You seem to be doing A-okay as their parking lot is always pretty full.  This is a hole in the wall, local kind of spot so don't expect a lot in the decor department etc. However if you are looking for amazing food this is the place to go... I mean it's a deli who cares about the decor :-)",

    "text": "If I lived in Charlotte I would probably eat here once a week or so. I love subs and growing up it was traditional to have subs once a week. This place brought me back to that time. These things are made with good flavored meat with toppings sliced just right. I asked for mine heated with toasted bread and that is just what I got. This thing was loaded with meat... no skimping out where it counts! I also ordered potato salad as my side and very much enjoyed it. It was not the best I have had but it was very good. The thing I liked the most about the potato salad was how simple/basic it was. It was not loaded with 100 different flavors or drowned in vinegar nor did it just taste like mustard. It had flavor yet you could still taste potato which I found nice since after all, it is potato salad.   My wife ordered her sandwich on an onion roll and she loved it. She got the baked beans with hers and said if you like Bush's baked beans then you would like these.   All in all, very pleasant experience. The server was very nice and the food was great. If it were not for the other reviews I would not have gone to this place. It doesn't look like much from the outside and is easy to miss. To be honest, when you walk in it won't look like much on the inside either. DO NOT let the looks fool you. I took others advice and my wife and I were more then pleased with our meal and the over all experience.  One last note... they had some decent beer and they were pretty cheap! I love beer so this was a bonus for me.",

Roast beef piled high, tender and delicious.  Danish ham with mayo tomato and lettuce, can be hot or cold.  Hot does not mean grilled.  Soup of the day a must and if chicken with rice is an option, get it.   Iced tea sweetened perfectly and refills kept coming.  Nice staff and you leave stuffed in a good way.   If not for Yelp we would have missed it and worth the turn around caused by the divided road.   Caution exiting and a low vehicle or motorcycle might not like the exit on the side by restaurant.     That said food is amazing.",

Sodas include canned Dr. Browns and they do have some wine and beer available.  We enjoyed what we ate, but I was hoping for bagels and smoked fish. Oh well.  Convenient location on East Independence if you're headed into the city. If you're heading out, you'll have to exit and go through a neighborhood, or continue onwards and make a u-turn.",

I like a nice toasty bread.  The sauerkraut was flavorful, so that was good.  The macaroni salad was absolutely awful.  I hate to be that blunt, but it had little to no flavor and the flavor it did have left and extremely bad after taste!  I was not a fan.

I walked in and placed a to go order with an older gentleman who I believe is the Chris of Chris' Deli. He immediately walked back to start making the sandwiches. I sat down to wait and suddenly overheard a staff member lose his cool and snap, \"Shut up. Just shut up. We bust our asses for you and you never even say thank you.\" Now on one hand, it's not cool to do that in front of customers. On the other hand, it's not cool for someone to be so frustrated at work that he feels he has to say that at all. The staff member came to the register to ring up another customer who was waiting and was very nice to him, and the staff member was very nice to me -- efficient, said thank you, and didn't act perturbed. I related the whole incident to my boyfriend who was surprised and said Chris had always been very nice to him whenever he was in there picking up an order.   So what gives? I have no idea what was said to the staff member. Does it take being kind of a jerk to keep a restaurant going since 1979? Probably so. Best pancake house I ever knew was run like an authoritarian regime, but employees stayed on there for years and the owner was a figurehead in the community. I don't want to feel sorry for the people who work at a place -- it makes me question what I'm supporting with my dollars. Does someone need a vacation? Management and empathy training? To just retire? Selfishly I don't want Chris' to close. The food always is great and super affordable.   Here's my thank you to those who put in hard work. I hope I'm not the only one who says it to them.",

It came out pretty good but this place has something secret going on.  I've also had the turkey sub (hot), pastrami no mustard (don't judge me), I even added pastrami to my turkey and that was the bomb. I have a lot of friends that love this place and for the most part they have nothing negative to say. I really don't either. It really is just a small simple place with simple food. It's just darn good.   It's also nice it is still thriving in an area that is currently struggling, with Independence construction and all. I will say they are in a pretty good little shopping center. Where else can you get great food, go next door and get your worship on, buy an e-cig a few more doors down, drop your kids off at day care, then zumba off that food. There s also a catering place too but that's another review.   This place is pretty much awesomeness. Oh and did I mention I am walking distance now. Yeah Im lucky.",

    "text": "I'm so upset I'm a Charlotte native that hasn't been here earlier! I'm a typical Charlotte millennial who tried out a restaurant after reading about it on Charlotte Agenda and I'm happy I did.  I went at 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon, so they weren't busy and I didn't have issues finding a parking spot. It is easy to miss on Independence Blvd if you aren't paying close attention and definitely be careful when you're exiting since the parkway is steep.   Chris and another female employee were there and couldn't have been friendlier. They were both sweet and patient with me while I took my time looking over the menu.   I ordered the Chris' Daily Special, which is roast beef, turkey, provolone cheese and mayo on an onion roll. I left off the mustard and ordered it hot. The special comes with your choice of a side item and I got the potato salad. I also added a cup of the chicken and rice soup.  Chris made my order himself and I barely waited five minutes for it. Everything I got was delicious. It was still hot when I got home with my takeout order ten minutes later. The meat was piled high and everything tasted fresh. I loved the potato salad and the soup was yummy comfort food.  I'm writing this review less than an hour after I ate this meal, which I've never done before as a Yelper. I sent the pictures to our family text message thread and my twin sister is livid I tried a sandwich without her since we are both sandwich lovers. I guess this means I'll have to make another trip soon!",

I would have not bothered posting this review if it wasn't for all the rave reviews which brought me here in the first place  This place is old, tired and dingy, it's lit up by mismatched, contrasting bulbs -some are bright white, others are amber. So OK it's been around since forever, but they could have fixed it up a bit. Sad  The help is yes very eager to help, can't fault the waitress. The coffee was weak and old (do I see a pattern emerging?) I came in search of Pastrami and Corned beef on toasted rye, it was just meh.  A thin sandwich, the meat was shaved as thin as carpaccio, the bread was itself was flat.  It only costs $8, which is on the low side for Pastrami but they could/should offer a fatter $10 or $11 version as an option.  Finally, the potato salad on the side was the worst, with that old, back of the refrigerator taste.     How does this sad diner rates nothing but 5 stars is beyond me!",

It is a little hard to get to unless you are traveling in the right direction, you can access the parking lot by driving around the block.   When you are in the mood for a sandwich, salad, or soup at an amazingly reasonable price head to Chris's. It is packed at lunch time but they are super fast for take out. They give a lot of side options with all their sandwiches and I totally recommend the potato salad. It was amazing.    It looks like they also sell meats by the pound. I took a picture of their current price list and posted. If you are in the area and looking for a quick and easy lunch check this place out!",

When my fiance and I walked in, we were not greeted by the brunette behind the counter nor the two gentlemen in the kitchen area. Upon walking to the counter ourselves, we asked if we could be seated. We were told to seat ourselves. The brunette followed us and asked us what we wanted to drink. She brought back our waters and didnt provide us a straw. She came back to our table about 10 mins later and asked us if we were ready to order without asking if we been there before nor if we had any questions. I quickly told her this was our first time and we needed a explanation of the menu. She recommended the daily deli so that is what I ordered. My fiance ordered a Turkey sub with bacon. I ordered the potato salad as a side and he ordered the macaroni salad. We got our food in about 10 mins. The subs were packed with meat but not enough mayo, oil, and vinegar.  Order extra! They also forgot to add my fiance's bacon! The waitress corrected it and brought out a few pieces of bacon. The macaroni salad lacked flavor and substance and tastesld mostly of plain macaroni. The potato salad was decent but lacked needed seasoning.  With the right seasoning, it would have been awesome. My fiance and I agreed that we may be back for the subs with extra oil, mayo, and vinegar but definitely not anything else.",

It is located right off of Independence at the end of a small strip mall, but don't its location defer you from coming! It can be a little tough to locate for the first time but totally worth it once you do.   All the people were super friendly and it seemed like there were a lot of locals inside that absolutely love going here on a regular basis. Why, you may ask? Because the food is amazing! Now I cant speak to much of the food since I have only been once, but what I did have was delicious. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on an onion roll with macaroni salad. The chicken salad was sooo good and fresh and it was a really nice sized portion for lunch. It also came with a nice scoop of macaroni salad (they have other sides if you prefer something else). I was stuffed after only eating half so I was even able to save my left overs for an easy dinner later that night!   The menu is pretty big and has so many things to offer, even catering for bigger events!!! Which we plan on using for our engagement party coming up :) I cant wait to go back soon and try some of the other delicious food that Chris' offers!",

From salads to sandwiches, soups and pitas, this place provides comfort in something simple, convenient and CHEAP. My go-to is either the chicken salad or egg salad on pita, toasted, topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles with potato salad on the side. I always get two meals out of the $6 dish and it is always delicious! Sometimes I stray and get the greek salad or grab a soup as a side instead. Either way, I'm never disappointed.

    "text": "So, I saw this place the last time I stopped at the computer store in the same strip mall and the reviews got me curious.  I had to make the trip back to the computer store and I told myself I would try these guys out the next time an opportunity arose.  I woke up this morning with a sore throat. Maybe getting sick, maybe too much drinking last night, not really sure.  I told the waitress I wasn't sure what I wanted to get; she suggested the chicken and rice soup since I wasn't feeling great. Excellent choice, it's also sold in bulk so it can be taken home. Chicken and rice was super creamy and tasty. Could use a slight bit more salt, but there was salt at the table and I'd rather it be under salted than oversalted. This may be my personal preference as well, I generally put a splash of soy sauce in my chicken and rice soup.  I got the steak and cheese, all the way, minus onions with chips. It was delicious. The waitress brought a bottle of some type of dressing which she suggested I add it, as that what she does. Really, really good. Vinaigrette type deal? I didn't hear what she said it was, but they were widely available.  On the strength of the food and other reviews, I got a BLT and potato salad to go for my mom. She doesn't like going out, but this type of food is right up her alley.  She loved it.  Great experience overall. Kinda dangerous because I need to watch my calories. They had lighter fare available.   Probably requires another trip to investigate.  Overall, really low key, really good food and apparently there's additional access via the neighborhood roads that don't require you to risk being rear-ended on Independence.",

Yes, I know I'm from Nebraska, but I think I've been in the South for too long now and lost my thick skin for chilly temps. Thanks to Yelp, I found this little old school deli and Charlotte gem tucked away in a strip mall on Independence.   The front of the menu has the tagline- you get your money's worth. That's all you need to know. End of review. I popped into Chris' at 8:30pm on a Monday. I was greeted warmly by one of the waitresses. Then it was decision time: vegetable, chicken noodle, or chicken and rice soup. I went chicken and rice. It was the perfect warm bowl of soup that I needed on a cold night. I also got a turkey reuben. So good. Note: they do their reubens with mustard. If you want thousand island, just make sure to ask. Soup, reuben, macaroni salad... all for about $10. I actually saved half my sandwich and side for lunch the next day. Two perfect Nikki-sized meals.   Chris himself was in the kitchen. He made my meal for me. He also took the time to come out, talk to me, and tell me about the place. (I walked in around closing time, so I was the only person there at the time) Such a sweet man. He even sent me home with a bag of apples. Why? Because he said they were so delicious.   I live in Elizabeth, so my GPS took me through a neighborhood on the backside of the strip mall. I didn't have to touch Independence at all. Just a heads up, in case you think your GPS is drunk.   Signs of a solid spot? The construction and bat ish craziness of Independence Blvd couldn't even slow down this place. It has a ton of regulars who pop in for lunch every week. You can add my name to that list.",

Always get Chris' special. Never disappoints!",

I got the Chris's daily special-roast beef, turkey, provolone mayo and brown mustard on an onion roll. Huge servings of meat. Will definitely be returning to Chris's deli!",
