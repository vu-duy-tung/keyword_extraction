My pet peeve with Panera is that the food order comes out in a hap-hazard way.  But not at this location!  I was so delighted to be handed a gadget to place on my table and was told that the order would come to me!  Hallelujah!  And it did - the complete order all in one go, and in a speedy fashion.  So refreshing to get this sort of service.  I was there with my son for a quick bite on Saturday lunchtime so the smooth and efficient service surpassed my expectations.  PS  The turkey chili was amazing.....I had never had that off the menu before, and I highly recommend it.  Came away very happy.  Great Panera location.",

There is no choice of \"braeburn\", \"pink lady\" or \"Gravenstein\". I would want organic and waxfree if I'm going to have an apple anyway.   I've enjoyed a croissant here a time or three.

I called the store immediately and spoke with the manager, gave them the customers name and they thanked me for letting them know and informed me they were making a new order for the customer. In a perfect world that's where this all should've ended b/c you're not legally allowed to re-serve food in this way. Well a few minutes later the driver called me and asked if the order was at my home. I told him yes and that I'd already called his location and they were already making a new order. He asked me if I had done anything with it - I said yes I placed the salad in the fridge b/c I have no use for it now but the soup and bread were still in the bag. He said \"yea I'm just gonna come pick it up now\" Um ok. I placed the salad back in the bag and handed it off to him when he came. His reasoning for it - your closer to the person than the store is. Having worked in food service this is so not allowed and is a violation. Makes me think twice about every time my delivery was late for whatever reason they gave.",

    "text": "I love Panera Bread, but this location is way too busy for my tastes. The parking lot is AWFUL. There's rarely any parking and the spaces are too close together. The compact car indicators do nothing to keep huge SUVs from taking up valuable space. If you don't want your car to get dinged, I recommend the Target parking lot and taking the short walk over to Panera.   It is very rare to walk in this restaurant and see any empty booths. This seems to be a prime location for studying or working on a computer, which is great, but that means there's never enough room for people who actually want to sit down for a bite. I'll tell you my prime secret: the Panera in Indian Trail is MUCH more spacious if you hope to get a table without having to reserve your seat since breakfast. The tables at the Matthews location are also way too close together for comfort. The staff are so busy that it's hard for them to acknowledge problems that go on in the dining area. For example, the last time I visited, there was a girl in the corner with her shoes off and her feet propped all over the booth chair in front of her. We tried to hint to her that this was pretty gross and not something we wanted to see when eating our (admittedly yummy) salads, but she wasn't having it. When having a business meeting or a casual sit-down meal in the future, I will travel down the road to a different location or find another restaurant entirely.",

    "text": "This Panera, located right in front of the Target off of Hwy 51 in Matthews is HUGE.  Plenty of both indoor and outdoor seating, they have your typical Panera selection of sandwiches, salads, soups and pastries.  The Saturday lunchtime crowd was crushing forward and the staff handled it like pros, keeping everyone moving.  I had the big kid grilled cheese with a cup of their broccoli cheddar soup, with a bear claw for dessert.  YUM!  Mom and dad both got ham and swiss with soup, with mom trying the corn chowder which smelled delicious.  She let me have a taste and it was delicious.  Although a little heavier on cilantro than I would care for, it was very tasty.    After discovering my love for the Panera, I got one of their cards (like everyone has) and in just a few visits several free things have accumulated, so if you think you are going to be a repeat customer, take a minute and get the card for free drinks, pastries and such.  There is a lot of \"compact\" car parking at this location (eye roll), so you may have to park at the back of the Target lot and hoof it - but it isn't too bad.  It's worth it!",

I explained to her that the sandwhich was incorrect.. expecting that she will just fix it or AT LEAST a APOLOGY! She immediately offered a refund... no apology no nothing!! Wasted 45 mins of my time for HORRIBLE SERVICE. I have been a manager for 8 years and she was not empathetic at all! I went to my car and decided that I will contact corporate... I called the cafe I just left 0774 Matthews location spoke with Cory AGAIN... still NO APOLOGY! Stated to her that I needed corporates phone number....lord behold this young lady tries to slide a slick one pass me and give me HELP DESK PHONE NUMBER! I don't know is she thinks that I don't have common sense or what not! I contacted corporate myself... and informed them of the situation... the lady I spoke with was appalled and very empathic. I will never go to this location again!!! I was late to work and frustrated at the same dang time!  I've never experienced service like this from anywhere! Then again this is 2017. Companies will hire anyone nowadays ...  I will Be contacting corporate again to make sure the issue is rectified! Cory has found the right one to play with :)",

And what chicken was on the bread was a  small amount.  The restaurant was unusually busy (parking an issue & few tables available.)  We were on a tight schedule so I took a photo of the sandwich and ate it. As we left, the crowd had subsided and there was no line at the counter, so I decided to speak to the manager.  I told him my sandwich was subpar (showed him the photo) and that my husband's sandwich was fine. He replied that the chicken is weighed so sandwiches are all the same. I left in a huff because, basically, he told me I was wrong. Other Panera Bread locations are MUCH better than this one. I enjoy Panera Bread but will steer clear of this one. The general  manager needs to learn better customer service.",

All tables were dirty, food and stuff on the tables.  So I wiped off a table and went to get our sodas.  Diet  Pepsi  was out, the beverage station was terrible, dirty, the floor was sticky, went to get a cover for our sodas and the container that held the lids was so dirty that we passed on the lids.  The vinyl seat where we sat was torn and nasty.  I went to wash my hands after trying to clean the table and the bathroom was disgusting, even after washing my hands They still felt dirty.  I can see a bathroom in a gas stations looking this bad but not in. A Place that Serves Food! The floor was so nasty I came home and cleaned the soles of my shoes off! There were at least 12 tables that needed immediate attention yet  a couple of employees walked around and didn't touch them. I can't imaging that this place could ever pass a health or sanitation inspection.  Our food was served and we could only drink our sodas and eat the chips that were in a bag, didn't trust if the kitchen was clean after looking at the rest of the facility.  This place used to be amazing.  E mailed the facility, and was told Thank You for your concerns we will share it with our workers!  SERIOUSLY?  From the other reviews this seems to be an o going problem! Is it to much to expect that when I spend $25.00  for lunch That  I could actually eat it in a clean we'll cared for place? My advice is save your money, go to another establishment that is clean, appreciates it customers and takes pride in their business.",

Most of their food has a ton of ingredients. I always forget what I order every time I come here, but it's a turkey/ham sandwich with some orange sauce on the bread. It's delicious.  The service hasn't really been good though. Especially when you pick up your food, everyone has a \"I want to leave\" look on their face. Panera is also very open when it comes to seating.",

The chicken was fatty, one time it was cold, one time it did not have all the ingredients it was supposed to have. Me and my husband were going to meet for lunch the other day and he actually said 'anything except Panera.'That surprised me, but I said 'Yep! I don't want to go there either!'

They couldn't find me in their half of empty restaurant til about 20 minutes later . When the cashier finds me she tells me what happened and apologizes. Then the \"server\" brings my sandwich and soup. Cold sandwich and lukewarm broccoli cheddar soup I should say. I guess they didn't want me to wait any longer so decided for me to not get a hot fresh meal. Not willing to be disappointed here again. Never will come back!",

First off, the prep people were not wearing gloves. So as they were checking to go orders for accuracy, they were riffling through bags and touching food with their bare hands. Secondly, this is probably the 3rd or 4th time this has occurred, but my drinks went out to a table while I was waiting for my to go order. Not a big deal right? Nope, not until a few minutes later when they realized they sent out the wrong drink and WENT TO GET IT FROM THE TABLE AND HANDED IT TO ME TO DRINK. Are you serious? When I asked for a remake, they got annoyed and didn't seem to understand why I did not want something that someone else could have already touched.   When I said something about it, the response was, \"the table numbers are confusing so it gets mixed up sometimes\" let me be clear. My issue is not that my food got mixed up. My issue is they have my food to someone else, went to get it, and tried to give it back to me.   Tossed my food in the trash on the way out. One time I can overlook, but clearly this is a reoccurring issue and one they are not willing to fix. Absolutely disgusting.",

Unfortunately, this time they lost our kiosk order. After about 30 mins of waiting and while the rest of the team was served, I check on the order. They made no attempt to rectify the problem, only asked each other...\"do you have an order '28' , no, \"do you have a '28', no\" all while making everyone else's order....and basically ignoring me. It took me asking for at least my son's mac and cheese so he could eat and get back to the fields. Finally, it wasn't till  another visit to the food counter that the general manager finally asked what I ordered, which he then fixed it at that moment. I forgot the cookie we ordered since I was in a hurry and not too happy. He said he would cancel the order in the system and I would not have to pay. Hmmmm, not sure how he would do that when they couldn't even FIND the order. Of course, when I checked my AMEX account, the Panera charge of $27.98 is there. Next time we will visit a different restaurant. I gave it two stars only because my son said the mac and cheese was good.",

    "text": "Just for the record, at my age (older guy)...I've probably taken time to write maybe...10 or so reviews. Of those, always recognizing exceptional products and/or service. Unfortunately, this breaks with my past record. Panera has good quality foods...never disappointed with salads or sandwiches I've ordered in the past. I've always found the Bagel's quite good, normally stopping by to pick up a dozen now and then. But that's where I now find my biggest complaint! The last three times I've stopped in to pickup a dozen \"mixed\" bagels, the baskets are \"all\" nearly empty. Meaning...if you had a certain combination in mind, don't bother stopping in. To leave with a dozen of the bagels \"you\" want...not going to happen. I've stopped in at 2:30pm...no selections. Twice recently that's happened. Today, I stopped by at 4:20pm...and was shocked to see \"in total\"... maybe...15 or so bagels. Some baskets totally empty...some with one, others with 3-4....with the couple having 6 or so, being the obviously less popular bagels. Having had to compromise my recent orders by picking from what was available, today was the first time I simply walked out with nothing. Tell me: why is it Panera is unable to maintain an inventory that matches daily volume? How is it that at 2 in the afternoon there is no attempt to keep bagels stocked? They close at 8pm! Out of product at 2pm? For me, simple enough to move on. Plenty of other Bagel Company's around.",

    "text": "Twice I've been here recently to order rapid pickup. App advertised meal will be ready in 8 minutes. Both times I arrived to only wait on my food for 10-20mins.  THATS NOT VERY \"RAPID\". Staff seems to have zero hustle. As pictured you can see wait times for other customers approaching 30 minutes. That is not the Panera I remember. Supposed to be good food, with a semi reasonable wait. Now this could be passable if the staff seemed to have a better system in place and wanted to get food out faster. Probably a result of poor training, pay, and management. Also a corporation that does not care about their customers or employees anymore. You might be losing me as a customer. 2 stars because the food is still pretty decent. Not great.",

I placed an online order and it said it would be ready in 8 minutes, 12:40 pm.  Arrived at 12:40 and didn't leave until 1:20.  It was my lunch hour (really 30 minutes) so that went down the tubes.  At the very least, notifications should have been sent indicating they were running late.    This is not the first time this has happened to me.    Just done with Panera in Matthews!",

    "text": "Panera Bread has always been my go-to for a quickly, somewhat healthy meal on the go. This location doesn't disappoint and recently expanded their hours to 10pm which is actually pretty late for the Matthews area. This location also offers rapid pick up which again is helpful when you are in a rush.   I usually order a pick 2 choice but vary from soup, sandwich, or salad. I'm a big fan of the autumn squash soup with pepitas on top. It's like fall in a bowl. Not such a fan of the French onion soup though because it's not prepared with the signature gooey cheese layer that one expects with that soup. I also recommend the Chinese citrus cashew salad and the Frontega chicken panini.",

I use the rapid pickup, but it has been sooooooo slooooow recently.  At least 6-8 names are waiting to be served and today a roach marched across the floor.  It seems the kitchen can't stay up with the rapid pickup orders from online and customers coming in to dine.  I witnessed more than one customer complaining about their order.  I hope they can get their act together and return to the way they used to be.",

This location is just as busy, especially during lunch. My issue is cleanliness. Tables are always dirty. Dirty dish bin kept overflowing. Fountain area cluttered and not consistently wiped down. Looks dingy and dark. Servers are hit or miss- polite or dismissive.   Better coordination needed to keep tables clean.  Sometimes my food comes out and an menu item has run out. However, I am a fan of their salads and soups.  Hope management looks to improve quality of space and customer care.",

This is my first time eating at the Matthews location however.. horrible is the only word I have to describe it. I ordered myself a half a tuna sandwich because it's my absolute favorite and I always get half because it's normally huge. Well my sandwich tonight with half of a half and there was hardly any tuna on it at all. Then I ordered my daughter her favorite, Broccoli and cheddar soup bread bowl. They were out of the bread bowls,so I asked them to put a couple slices of bread in there for her so she could break it up and put it in her soup, which they did not do after they told me they would... I also bought some bagels and bread for the morning, hoping they at least taste good. So long story short, I spent $20 I'm still hungry and she has no bread for her soup ... I don't know what's going on in that store but I'll never go in there again.... That's very unfortunate because it's conveniently two minutes from my house",
