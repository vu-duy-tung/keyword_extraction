I'd rate that a 2. The quality isn't great. I tried the fish tacos and the muy caliente tacos. Both were okay but don't say very hot tacos and forget to put in the peppers. My 3 year old niece could have eaten this it was so mild. In my opinion if you're looking to impress your date with how much money you have and want to fit in them this is the place. If you want authentic Mexican food head to the east side of town! Ten times the quality for a quarter of the price.",

It was about 2 o'clock, the server wasn't the nicest, (also knowing we had never been there before) however the food was great and all of the other servers that helped take care of our table were awesome as well. The service was fast. Of course when you go to a Mexican restaurant most people get the combination plates and that's exactly what we did. The salsa is good, it does have a little kick which I loved. I got the chicken quesadilla and steak taco. I really like the refried beans. Charlotte definitely needs more Mexican restaurants that are decent, finally SouthEnd has one. Will definitely go back, and just hope to have a nicer server next time.",

    "text": "Despite being so bad the first time when we dined-in (see review below), my girlfriend wanted to give them another shot, so she stopped by and got two shrimp tacos to go. She got them home, and one of the tacos didn't even have any shrimp on it. She said they tasted horrible, so I gave it a taste, and she was right, YUK! No flavor/quality to the ingredients, and over priced for what you get. Tasted like something from the frozen isle of the grocery store... maybe not even that good.  I'd really like to see it become a great place, so next time I walked by, I stopped in to offer my feedback to the manager.  Well, I quickly found out why their food is so bad. The manager didn't even want to know what was wrong with our dishes, and acted as if he knew their food was really bad and just didn't care... like maybe they only care about liquor sales? The manager didn't even offer to try to make it up to us. wow!  Dear Hot Toco, either totally revamp your food service, or leave the building so someone else can come in and offer decent food to the residents of the area.",

    "text": "Was excited about going to Hot Taco because I had enjoyed the place that was there before and wanted to check it out. The parking was a hurdle because it was a Saturday night and with all the other clubs and bars nearby the parking was scarce. Had to walk a couple blocks to get there but that was a minor thing. Got to the restaurant and joined a birthday party there that was in progress. They had eaten and warned me service was slow and the food was only ok. As it is Mexican food I felt it would be fine for me to eat there because there's not much I don't like and it's relatively easy to make. Service was a little slow but maybe it was because of the party, which was 22 people strong. I ordered a combo because the pricing structure made it seem like the best option. Taco are $5 each and the combo I got not only included 2 tacos for $10 but also a half quesadilla for only a dollar more. The orders were taken and food came relatively quickly, which was nice. But, the food was only so so. The tacos were dry with no sort of sauce and the meat was seasoned very sweetly, which was different but tolerable. The quesadilla did not come with sour cream or salsa as most do and was also kind of dry. After the party, I tried to leave and was hassled by the doorman because I stopped in a little side area to say goodbye to a friend. They were upset I didn't go out the \"right door\". So, not a horrible experience but I probably will not be back, mostly just because there are better restaurants for Mexican food and also more entertaining Latin nights. Your mileage may vary.",

After 25 minutes, food only came for half the table, it took 10 minutes for the other orders to come to the table. Food was ok, but we had been waiting for so long at the table we mostly filled up on chips and salsa. There are plenty of other choices around.",

    "text": "So I like this place. HOWEVER. After having gone three times in the last few weeks (kids eat free Monday's woot) I had to write a review. First off, I like the vibe, and that's important to me, so kudos for that. Big, roomy booths and really big, cool place. Here's the scoop. I like taco salad, I just do. It's not exciting, but I dig it. The first time we went I got the taco salad and it was good! Not fancy, but a solid yummy taco salad and I was not offended, so the second time I decided to get it again, and it was even better! I figured that the last time had been a fluke, even though it had been good, but that THIS was the way they initially intended to make it! It was MUCH larger (like twice the size) and had all kinds of avocado on it which had not been there the first time, and was so fresh. It was amazing. So naturally, the third time, I was pretty confident in ordering the taco salad again. But no such luck! It was the worst one yet! It was much smaller than the previous two, the chicken tasted kind of like tuna fish, and it was a completely different dish for the third time in a row. Weird!   So my review is this (and mind you, it's mostly just for taco salad, lol). It CAN be really good, but it's definitely hit or miss just because it's just not consistent. When it's good, it's really good, but when it's something entirely different for no apparent reason, it's just bleh. Other folks eating here with me say that it's not the best Mexican they've ever had, but it's not the worst, either. I'd give an extra half star if I could for being alongside the trolley rail trail, because we always bike when we come, and it's super convenient.",

All I can say about the asada taco is TASTE.LESS. It takes a certain level of skill to somehow suck the flavor out of otherwise flavorful things. As for the blackened fish taco...this one had more taste, unfortunately is was of a metallic variety. Not sure if that taste was coming from the fish or the cabbage but it was mighty strong. On a positive note the tacos are of a generous size and the waitress, while not very attentive, was really very friendly.  Not sure I will give it another shot, perhaps on another Tuesday. Also the name of this place is pretty dang gross. If you ever want to find this place even remotely appetizing do yourself a favor and DON'T look up 'Hot Taco' on Urban Dictionary....",

Who can beat $2 shrimp, Korean BBQ, and more exciting flavored tacos? No holds barred on any of the 12 or so taco flavors on the menu! I've come here with my family and friends as well and we always left with smiles and full stomachs.  Welp, all good things must come to an end.    After months of great food and service, they have suddenly fallen completely off. The choices of $2 tacos are now limited to 5 flavors (if you guessed that it is the 5 most basic tacos, you are correct). The ones I had were oozing with grease in every bite. My appetizer didn't even show up until I was done eating. One of my party had to request the correct drink 3 times before they got it right. Another was given the wrong tacos altogether... It was just a nightmare.   From the wait being double what we were quoted to the time it took for food to arrive, everything was just wrong. Not to mention they have now dropped to a 90 sanitation score. This will be my last visit.  R.I.P. Hot Taco.",

Everyone loved their food. The drinks were reasonably priced. I'll definitely be back for a margarita. I'd probably come on a weekend night when there more people. We were 4 out of maybe 20 people there.  It was right before CIAA though and they were going to close for private weekend events so I get it. All in all I'd come back for sure. The service was excellent and our server was super friendly",

However, we went for National Taco Day (last Wednesday), which they were doing $2 tacos from a limited menu. 3 out of 4 orders were wrong, the tacos and quesadillas were TERRIBLE and took an extremely long time to receive. The waitress was nice and friendly, but SLOW. There were maybe 10-15 occupied tables when we were there later in the evening.  Summary: Friendly but slow staff, disgusting food that was not accurate to our orders. Taco Bell would have been a tastier, quicker, less expensive way to do National Taco Day.",

    "text": "No bueno.  Hot Taco is just as bad as its ugly twin next door. The atmosphere is great but service and food here is lacking in the quality department.    It was just last Thursday and I ordered two tequila shots... what came out still haunts me.  Aside from them coming out warm and not chilled.  One shot glass had the usual: salt, lime, tequila; the other...salt, ORANGE, tequila.  I literally did a double take and as the waitress saw the horror on my face, which she explained they ran out of limes and thought an orange would suffice.  Whatcha talkin' about Willis? This is a Mexican restaurant you can't run out of limes and there is a Publix right up the street, have someone get more.  That's like ordering guacamole and they say, \"Sorry ran out of avocados, but we have tomatoes!\"  Just let us know before you make that kind of decision for us, it was insulting and sounded lazy.   The second \"hiccup\" up of the evening was ordering a side of refried beans.  I don't know what is worst, finding out Santa isn't real or the refried beans at Hot Taco.  No one does a better job of describing what I received than Outkast. \"What's cooler than cool... Ice Cold!\"  Thankfully I wasn't charged for it, but seriously why was it half frozen? *Insert thinking emoji*  The people want to know.   I will say the staff was nice and trying their best that night, but swing and a miss on every other category.   Hot Taco you need to be better, this is South End, stop being an amateur.  However, I will most likely be back, not because of the food, service or drinks.  But, because it's there.",

Very stereotypical. So based upon how the table looks determines how you treat them. And to top it off, she would curse describing the menu. Saying things like \"it has a little sh*t on it\" or things of the sort. She said shit about 6 times. I couldn't believe it. Very Professional. I won't be back!",

I visited twice during my recent stay in Charlotte and first time I had tacos (the fish tacos were my favorite) great flavor.  Great amount of breading on the fish.  Sauce wasn't too hot.  Crispy slaw with the tacos.  Chips and salsa were great.  Second time I just had a burrito but was full of chicken and it was also fantastic.  The beans were full of flavor and served w rice.  Reasonably priced and great place to hang out.  They have an outdoor seating area. Many TVs for enjoying football games.  It was Carolina Panther's opening night and many people were enjoying food and watching the game. This is a great place to go alone as I did or many groups hanging out as well.",

First when we got there, we were told our wait would be about an hour.

We were sat at a table under a pipe or something which kept leaking water on us from the condensation. We then moved tables, they were out of pork so I couldn't get any pork tacos.

The beef fajitas, although, had a nice sear, seemed lackluster.  I wanted more flavor from them.  The Venue... GREAT SPACE I liked the way the rows of booths created an open space for the BAR area.",

I came by myself one night after work and it took them more than 5 mins to just seat myself then Another 5 for a waitress to acknowledge me when she did she even brought water that's how long I'd been there . I asked if I could get my tacos Togo be cause I'd waited so long and she took my order with no problem. So the next week I tried to call ahead and I was informed the kitchen closes at 11AM BUT THEY CLOSE AT 12 ! This is the most ridiculous things I've seen and heard. Like you close at 12 so the kitten should close when the restaurant closes I understand maybe closing a little late but an entire hour THATS RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!  So then when I asked if I came in order my tacos like last time could I get take out they said no. BUT IVE DONE IT BEFORE (I explained to the manager on the phone that I was willing to drive from Ballantyne from work just eat your food,he still said no unless I was charged full price instead of $2)and for that I will never eat here again.",

When we got up to leave, the host said not to leave because our waitress was coming.  Sorry, too long for an empty Tuesday night.  Second experience was especially frustrating.  We had a group of six on Friday, March 11.  The tacos were all dry and not very good.  But what really irked me was our waitress.  I paid cash and was supposed to get $17 change, but I only received $12.  I assumed it was an honest mistake.  I sat there for about five minutes before I approached our waitress; she immediately pulled the missing $5 out of her boot and said, \"oh yeah I was going to come back, I thought I may have forgotten to give you change.\"  I literally didn't even say anything to her, she just blurted that out after me watching her go about her normal business for five minutes.  Honest mistake?  Maybe.  Won't be going back to Hot Taco until they clean up their act.",

    "text": "Went for Taco Tuesday. We were first seated at a table. I asked the hostess if she could clear off one of the dirty booths so we could sit there (there were 3 dirty booths in a row). We sat and waited for at least 20 minutes for someone to clean one booth off. We watched every single server and bus person walk past them without cleaning them off. When they finally cleared off the booth our waitress was obviously very overwhelmed. She handled herself very well considering she had a boatload of tables. I ordered 2 margaritas and they were very inconsistent. Neither one had the correct ratio of mix to alcohol. I'm sure it was a premixed drink. Sad. The tacos were awful and were unappealing looking. The only good one was a the veggie taco I got. I was surprised with how good that one was. So I got 1 out of 4 that was good. The waitress spilled water all over one of our friends. She was really sorry but she could have destroyed his phone if he hadn't moved it quickly. Not a good experience.",

    "text": "We went to Hot Taco at the busy time on a Friday night. There was a little wait, but mostly because they seemed understaffed. The hostess was very shy.  The salsa was almost spicy. The cocktails are very very sweet, way too sweet for our liking, but if you like sweet drinks they would be good. My paloma (\"Ventura\") tasted more like pink lemonade.  The stuffed jalapenos were out of this world!!! They're stuffed with pork and cheese and have plenty of heat. Yom! The enchilada was crispy fried, also tasted good.  I got the poblano stuffed with veggies and cheese,  which wasn't bad, but the cheese wasn't fully melted, which was a disappointment. The kale gave it a different flavor in a good way.  Sad we didn't try the tacos or empanadas, but we'll probably be back. Overall it was what you'd expect: casual, slightly overpriced Mexican-American fare in a great location.",

    "text": "I must have really been enamored with Hot Taco but let me warn you: SERVICE SUCKS.  It's sporadic at best and inconsistent on a good day. Yeah, I know sounds like semantics but it's not. They have different definitions and HotTaco proves it.   Went Tuesday after 9pm and was told there's a 45m -1 hour wait. No biggie but I left after 10 minutes. I'm happy they have a dedicated hostess now and they'll text you when your party can be seated. Returned  Wednesday at 5p and was amazed how many people were present. Took a while to get a server to acknowledge me and she was decent when she did.   The $8 FROZEN mango margarita was not good. Had less flavor than the lime and  sugar rim.  I didn't ska daddle over to the salsa bar this time BUT for the 1st time ever...  I TRIED THE  CHORIZO  EMPANADAS and..... YES Lord!  Look, I don't care for the chorizo on the queso as the pork is greasy. It just is.  But whomever they decided to hire to cook midday got these empanadas all the way right.  I thought about them today as I enjoy the left overs.   Warning they come on a bed of diced tomatoes with a salsa for dipping and a sour cream based decorated with zig zags on the plate.   I meant to take pictures as they were light, airy, crispy, velvety and was not overstuffed nor greasy. The dough was reminiscent of Phyllo for Greek dishes.   Well, let me wrap up with: Don't expect much for service. This is Tex-Mex fusion at best. Quit with the authentic gripes. I'm starting to think: Y'all would go to Mexico and complain.  Tuesday margaritas range from watered down to salty BUT HEY they're $2 and that's what 'cha get.  Portions vary based on who showed up for work.  None of the deals are to go. Must dine in.  Lids don't always fit the cup sizes they bring out hence I dropped sour cream when walking out from work while wearing sandals. Why? Lid too small for the cup size.  Fajita shrimps can be large or small.  Rice may be salty or done just right.  Refried Beans may be old or fresh & tasty You'll always only get 3 tortillas no matter the size of the skillet.  You'll get more lettuce and pico than Sour Cream AND especially NOT the cheese on the setup but hey~ IT\"S HALF OFF ... DEAL!  With all that, HotTaco still gets 4 stars and they lost 1 due to that service issue. Look at my check-ins; I think I have enough credibility to state: the service is whack.   Get the empanadas, queso, guac, stuffed jalapenos, street corn and Hot shrimp Get the shrimp tacos, fish tacos, fajita skillet, chimi and  on the rocks original margarita or the 1 with the corona per my friends. I can't judge liquor.",

    "text": "Where to even begin. I struggled with whether or not to even take the time out of my day to write a review considering Hot Taco's reviews are terrible anyway. Alas, here I am. This is a long post, so if you want the Reader's Digest version, I've summed up our experience at the bottom.  I had my first Hot Taco experience when I came in for my birthday back in April. I called the morning of and made a reservation for 10 people at 7:30 on a Saturday night. \"No problem!\" They said. Wellllllll....We get there, right on time mind you, and the hostesses looked confused when I gave them my name, then floundered and claimed that our table was \"being cleaned\" after we saw them look up my name in the system and their expressions made it clear that there was no reservation in my name. Once we got seated (25 mins after our original reservation time), the food was less than subpar, drinks were awful (how do you mess up a Margarita?) and service was mediocre at absolute best. I gave them the benefit of the doubt considering it was a relatively busy Saturday night.   We returned against my better judgement for Taco Tuesday this past Tuesday, and I'll give them this, they're nothing if not consistent (in the worst way). We ordered tacos at the bar, and watched the waitress put the tacos behind said bar and forget about them. We didn't know they were ours at the time. Fast forward an hour...yes, an hour, and we moved to an open table, but before that, we closed our drink tab. We got to the table & ordered more tacos considering we hadn't received our original order. We let the waitress know that we never received our tacos at the bar so she went to confirm, and the bartender (wish I could remember her name), claimed those tacos sitting behind the bar were ours, and she just never got them to us. REALLY?! That's your literal job.   Come to find out, the waitress ended up charging the uneaten, undelivered tacos to our card AND tipped herself. It took us 2 days of back and forth with the manager to get the charges reversed.   Moral of the story, Hot Taco not only has poor service, drinks and tacos, but their employees, in particular, that bartender, have poor morals. Will not be back and urge others to take your business elsewhere.",

She was short with us, didn't smile a single time didn't say welcome- threw menus at us and ran off, didn't even say hello. It wasn't even busy...  Drinks and apps came out fast- our tacos took ages to come out. The kitchen had tons of tickets in the window with one cook on the line. No one came to apologize for the wait and there seemed to be no manager on duty. We got our food but no one came over to make sure we liked it or had everything we needed. Saw our server constantly eating in the back. Food was okay but not sure that we would ever come back.",

Less than average tacos, quesadillas, even chips and salsa (and they have a salsa bar). I've been here both for dinner and \"brunch\" and both times were 'eh'. The food isn't garbage, but is not the quality that you would expect for such a busy area and a great location. I've also gotten a margarita and mimosa from here and both had the similar reaction of \"eh. It's not really bad, just not exactly good or what I was expecting/hoping for.\"  They have outside seating with TVs, which was a plus. The inside decor and seating areas were very cool (with TVs as well). Other than Hot Taco having a great location and really cool and interesting decorations, there food is really just a waste of money.",

But when one goes to any establishment to eat, expecting edible food is a basic requirement! But no. Hot taco couldn't even deliver on that.   My bf and I came to this place on taco Tuesday (I know, I know..that should've been an indicator to not come) and we waited an hour to be seated. The wait wasn't the dealbreaker - we expected that there would be a wait since it was Tuesday but it's walking distance from our place so we figured why not?  We were seated an hour later...bf ordered three tacos and I ordered one bang bang taco. Server gave us chips and salsa and that was the last we saw of her.  When my bang bang taco arrived (a food runner brought it over), I looked at it and was like \"ummm what's this?\" Half of the ingredients that were supposed to come on the taco were missing!   Since the server was nowhere to be found, we had to track down another employee (I think she was the hostess) and explained that the spicy slaw, seafood sauce, and avocado aioli that were supposed be in the taco were missing. Hostess looked at the taco and said \"yeah, I don't know what they did there.\" She took the taco back (hopefully to have it redone) but I didn't see her after that and didn't see the taco either.   After waiting another 20 minutes for the mysterious taco, I finally located the server (she was sitting down at a table chatting with friends!!) and explained what happened. She went to check on the missing taco and came back with a taco drenched in a white sauce. I took one bite of the taco and couldn't eat it. It was gross and flavorless.   The server brought us our bill (without even offering to take care of the one taco - she clearly saw that I was upset) and I finally had to explain to her that we were frustrated with this experience and were willing to wait an hour for food that wasn't delivered as expected. She brought the manager over and the manager was apologetic and offered to take care of our $8 bill (tacos are $2 on Tuesdays)  At the end of the day, taking care of a $8 bill doesn't bring back the 2 hours that we wasted at the establishment. I urge this place to be considerate of their patrons' time and provide better service and food.   In the meantime, do yourself a favor and go to Sabor on taco Tuesdays if you are craving decent tacos. You won't regret saving two hours and leaving on a full, content stomach.   Sincerely,  Still Hungry and Frustrated",

I've been here on several occasions and if it wasn't for the people I was with each time it wouldn't have been my first choice after my first experience. The location and deco are great and the food is okay. It's a good taco Tuesday place if you get on the waiting list early as they have some good $2 tacos and $2 mini margaritas but just be prepared to wait. The best bet is to order as soon as your waiter gets to you because it may be awhile before they come back.",

After we got our drinks, we wanted to order a appetizer but our server didn't come by for a long time. The chips and salsa are good. Salsa has a good flavor and kick to it. When the server came, we finally ordered our appetizer but we were also ready to order food. As soon as I told her our appetizer, she walked away. So we had to wait another while before she came. We got the queso. It was ok. It was thick but  not spicy.   I ordered the fajita rito and it was good but had more beans than meat. It came with chicken, steak, shrimp with rice and beans and lettuce. Came with queso sauce on top with a red sauce. Overall, it was good but lacked meat and there was some type of spice/herb that was in it that had a very strong mint taste. It was so potent that some parts were hard to eat. My husband got the combo and he liked it. Our friends also liked their food.   One thing that was also strange was after my husband and his friend got a beer, they wanted to get another beer and when they were looking, the server finally told them the drink/beer specials. Would of been nice to know ahead of time.   Overall, this place is ok. The best part is the chips and salsa. I'm glad I tried it.",

We came in with a large party, without a reservation, and we're told we'd be seated soon. I asked for a time and they said just a few minutes.   After 20 minutes I asked again - when we'd be seated and was again told just a minute. After another 15 minutes, I yet again went to ask and this time asked to speak to a manager, as there had been significant table turnover in this time. We finally got seated 10 minutes later.   While this wait wouldn't have been a problem, if we'd been told up front, we were strung along and would have gone elsewhere, had we been told at the onset that we'd have a 45 minute plus wait.   Overall the food was average and not all the orders were correct. The saving grace were the happy hour prices on tacos and margaritas. I might return given the happy hour prices, but would try other places first given the service.",

We were sat in the outside bar area and after sitting there for a while, realized that the seating was awkward and uncomfortable so I asked the hostess if we could move to a patio table. She said we could and wiped one down for us. After waiting for 15 minutes for a server, one of the other hostess' came up to our table and told us that we were not getting service because we sat ourselves. I would like to elaborate that this was my second time ever coming here and she was working both times and had a terrible attitude both times. She said \"for future reference\" and stood by the table embarrassing us and borderline yelling. Server finally came up to us but our food was delivered before our drinks even were. Manager dropped food off and just threw it on the table and walked away without asking if we needed anything else. Entire experience left a bad taste and I 100% will NOT be back until they hire competent staff and get rid of the unprofessional people that currently work there.",

I chalked it up to opening week jitters. I went back this weekend for brunch and realized that it's not opening week issues - Hot Taco's food just sucks.   My roommate and I played it safe and ordered nachos. They were probably the worst nachos I've ever had. No salsa, just chopped up tomatoes (I'm guessing it was supposed to be pico de gallo). Pickled, not fresh jalapenos. The chicken was over-cooked and the chips were really, really salty. I don't know how a Mexican-centric restaurant can screw up nachos so badly, but they did.   I gave it two stars overall because the blood orange lemonade mimosas were decent.",

Similar to any fast food taco, but maybe with a dash of pineapple. So really the $2 \"special\" is still overpriced. The service was even less to write home about. To be fair we did have a large group, but there are some basic requirements of service. For example, even when you are a \"new hire\" perhaps don't offer up food and say \"I'm new I don't know what any of these are.\" Yeah well all your crappy tacos look the same.   There are some nice parts about the establishment -- there's a good number of parking spaces across the street and the outside patio does fit large groups well.

Great start until we were actually ready to order and there was not a waitress in sight. Mind, our dinner started at 7 pm and we did not receive our dinner until 8:30 pm.. we ate nothing but chips the whole hour and half so by the time the food came we were stuffed. My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and was given MY chicken quesadilla which they took back after she took one bite and realized it wasn't what she ordered. This happened to another friend who was also apart of the party but it was exactly what she ordered and the waitress continued to just take it away from her. By the time the shrimp and chicken quesadillas came out they were soggy and again we were not hungry at the time. My meal totaled $19.00 and that is counting a $7.00 queso which I've never had to spend that much at a Mexican restaurant before... especially for a quesadilla and queso. And for a tablespoon of guacamole was an EXTRA $2.00.  Never again! Oh yeah.. and we saw one of the waiters kicking and stepping on roaches right by our table in the kitchen... You're welcome",

I had the carnitas and had to send them back to the kitchen exchange for chicken fajitas because they were so salty I couldn't stomach choking down a whole plate. The chicken fajitas were ok but rather dry. I had a strawberry frozen magarita that tasted soley like cheap tequila.  I've been previously and the food was solid. So maybe the kitchen was having a bad noght.",

If the salsa you get isn't your thing, you have the option to go to the salsa bar and choose from a number of difference salsas with different sorts of tastes and sauce levels. When we went it was a little busy, but not too busy for 7PM on a Friday night.  FAIR WARNING: Pay attention to the heat levels. I had the bang bang fish tacos which are rated \"5 skulls\". I figured it shouldn't be too bad as I have had ghost chili peppers without too much trouble. These things are nuclear! Probably one of my poorer life choice - the first bite was good, but the second bite was agony for the next 12 hours.",

    "text": "Okay my original review was 2 months the ago and I gave them 2 stars. I'm bumping them up 1.5 stars to a rating of 3.5. And this is my second time coming back since Feb. Last month, I sat at the bar which was a great experience and the bar tender was great. I came back in with my mom on Saturday around 2:30pm and had a hiccup. The restaurant wasn't full but we had to wait about 8 mins for a table, still not really a big deal to me. Anywho much to my surprise, I had the same server that epically failed during my 1st review. Okay this was their chance to redeem themselves and also my chance to provide another review. Once again, I was rooting for Hot Taco. The food is so good but unfortunately the service is spotty. I also just think that serving isn't the strong suit of the server we had.  Food came  out hot and fast unlike the last time, our server even came back to check on us a couple of times. Definitely a step up from the last time. Here's where there was a hiccup. Of course I checked in on my Yelp app and redeemed the free appetizer. I ordered the empanadas for the app and then a side of grilled corn. My mom got a combo plate. When the bill came, my app was still on the bill and they also charged me for the app corn and not the side corn. When I kindly pointed it out to our server and I told her I asked for grilled corn and not the app corn, she replied that she wasn't paying attention when I was placing my order.  This was the same issue that we had the last time when she was our server, which was why many of our orders were not correct. Needless to say, the manager ended up comping me the grilled corn and of course the appetizer. Next time, I may just ask for an different server.",

That was until one of the DRUNK employees sitting at the bar with a full uniform on started telling customers what they could or could not do or order. On top of that the barback would talk about customers behind their customers. This is my second visit here and this reassured me to never come back here. You're better off spending your money in any other good southend bar. Get rid of employees who drink at the bar while in uniform and Barbacks talking bad about customers. So unprofessional.",

    "text": "The food is not good, nor is the service.  My wife and her friends had been here before for their drinks (Margaritas, etc), and I was told prior to going that the food was average.  We went there for Mother's day 2016 - everyone in our party was Mexican, but me..  It took 15 minutes after we were seated to have our server Erin come over and greet us and take our drink orders.  She seemed like she didn't want to be there that day; she never smiled, she was monotone, and literally did everything thing in the book to lessen her tip.    We had a party of 6 and sat outside(eventually 7) - we were seated at two small round tables that were pushed together.  These small tables are fine for small parties, but not for larger groups in a communal setting.  When our app's (guacamole fresco, queso blanco con chorizo - we ordered the fried jalapenos later..) came out, we couldn't even share across tables b/c you had to actually stand up or pass the app over to the other person.    \"Hot Taco\" this is something you should consider on the patio; a 4'x8' rectangle for larger parties.    After placing our drink order it took another 10 minutes to get the WATER to our table, and the margaritas and other mixed drinks took even longer.  I will say that she told us that they are short a server, but that is not my problem, and I'm sure she could've walked faster if she wanted to.  Regardless, the service was painfully slow, for everything, and we were rarely \"checked upon\".  Hot Taco was NOT slammed that day, nor near reaching full capacity.  Their website says their looking for motivated people to hire.  I think they're failing on that aspect.    The only reason we went there was b/c my MIL wanted a good Margarita.  She was pleased with her drink, but commented that the food was 'okay', which is her way of saying \"not good\".  I agree, the food was not good.  My wife had the Korean Beef Tacos, if I were to grade on presentation, it would've been a 3/10.  Taste 5/10.  The paltry amount of beans and rice they give you is sad, as was the taste of it.  My father in law had the fish tacos.  This is a man known for eating anything, at anytime, anywhere, regardless of when his last meal was.  He didn't finish the tacos, nor the beans and rice.    The guacamole came out in a big glob on a big plate with two tortilla chips stuck into it (my MIL did verify it was fresh, but it needed more salt and lime juice)...  The queso con chorizo was terrible.  The tortilla chips they serve, sub-par.  The Queso con chorizo comes in this little skillet that sits atop a little holder that has a little candle underneath it to keep it from congealing.  The candle is worthless, and it thickened rather quickly.  The fried jalapenos weren't that great either.  There was actually one left at the end of the night if that says anything.  Erin talked us into the \"fried cheese cake\" - it wasn't that good either, and it was fried!!  What fried food isn't good?  Hot Taco's fried food apparently.        I guess they also have a small selection for the music they play.  For first 3/4 of our time there, all we heard was Reggaeton?!  I guess that's part of the \"hip\" vibe they're going for? \"Um, how about some Vicente Fernandez, or Ana Gabriel?\".  Once the Reggaeton playlist played out, then came some Merengue and other upbeat Hispanic club classics.  My wife and her friends commented on how they heard the same songs the last time.    For the prices they're asking, you're better off going to a 'Real Mexican' restaurant - if you want real Mexican food (This food is the Americanized version of Mexican, seriously).  If you want to appear trendy and say you ate uptown, and you like bad service and sub-par food, then eat here.    I rarely tip less than 20%, but on this day, our bill came to $147.xx, and I tipped just under 15% (if I had the heart, I would've tipped less)...  Again, the service was slow and simply unpleasant, the food was not good, and when our meals came out, they came out in pairs, not altogether, in 3-4 minute intervals...  Bottom line, if you want a good drink, I 'guess' you could go here, but if you want real Mexican food look elsewhere.  The only thing good I can say about my first and last visit to Hot Taco is that the decor was pretty cool, inside and out, but you can't eat the decor...",

Sum of our experience:  - Server was cool - Atmosphere is what you pay for - Food was awful (honestly I've had better food at Chipotle)  This was our first night visiting Charlotte and we took a drive to get some food. Stopped in because the place looks really cool. Some awesome authentic decorations, they really put a lot into making this place look fun. That is pretty much all we enjoyed.  Got tacos and fajitas. The tacos were bland with barely any flavor. A spicy shrimp taco tasted like deep fried shrimp tossed in buffalo sauce.... hardly authentic. Another chicken taco was so dry I didn't even want to eat it.   Boyfriend got steak fajitas that looked like dog food. The amount of peppers and onions looked like the leftover scraps from the night, soggy and burnt at the same time, clearly not fresh. Served with a couple of dirty plates for ya folks. This was supposed to be their discounted fajita night special so not sure if the poor quality had anything to do with that...  Also had a margarita in a pint that I'm pretty sure had no alcohol in it. I'm a lightweight and could have ran a marathon after this.   We were so disappointed because we frequent taco and marg restaurants everywhere we go and this was the worst by far.",

    "text": "Please reference to paragraph c before reading the rest of the review.  a.) As my friend and I came in we were excited to see all of the funky decor. As an interior designer I thought it was a very trendy funky space so props to the designer. I did think the booths in the center just sitting elevated out in the open were odd... My thoughts are to add a wall and make the other side have a small lip with bar stools. It would make more space for customers since there seems to be a complaint about the wait and add privacy to the awkward booths.   b.) The food... Eh it's just alright nothing to write home to mom and dad about. (Hot taco is also owned by whiskey warehouse, brazwells, slate, etc. if that says anything.) It's great deals on the food but I don't know about you but I would rather pay a little more and get better food and better service...  I was reading the reviews and did get a free appetizer! ( please note the waitress saw me on Yelp. So she had to of known I saw all of the reviews... It's hard not to when there are so many off them). As I continue on The waitress let us enjoy our appetizers for awhile and then I asked if she would take our order when she came back to the table. Her response was, \"can I get some chips for you guys before that?\". She comes back no chips I don't know what the heck happened seemed like an excuse to me not to take our order.   c.) Well i really wasn't going to let any of this bother me until I saw the bartender and waitress pick out a bug in someone's Margarita before serving it to the poor customer. After I had already eaten and had two margaritas for myself!!  d.) Oh wait! I spoke too soon it was going from worse to absolutely terrible when the waitress came back from checking us out and NONE of the cards were mine. So it will have gone from terrible to horrific once my cards are compromised. I did all that I could to keep a smile on my face. The waitress didn't even seemed phased by this.   e.) really wanted to like this place but I am sorry this first timer will never go back. My thoughts are close the place for a week... Train your staff or hire people who care. (Mainly fire the bartender and waitress) and reevaluate some of your menu.",

The food isn't bad - there is at the very least a decent selection and the tacos are pretty consistent.   I've probably been here at least six Tuesdays and almost always regret my decision within 2 minutes of being in the door.   First off, management - I'd like to directly address you on your hiring choices. Every hostess I've ever spoken to here literally seems shocked that I would ask for my name to be put on the list for a table. I'm sorry, but when they applied to be a hostess wasn't that kind of the expectation? The shock isn't even what annoys me most though, it's the blatant rudeness. I don't think I've ever been treated with less human decency in my life. It's a pattern and I wouldn't leave this review if it wasn't.   Bartenders are hit and miss. Some have gone above and beyond (by some I mean only one), but the rest have been so rude it's unbelievable. I understand that you're busy - I'm not concerned about waiting when people are slammed. My concern is literally at times being told to order my food with other bartenders because they're too busy, in a very disrespectful fashion. When a patron is being polite and patient this just poorly reflects on the establishment. Particularly when your watered down sugary house margaritas mix is giving me a headache.   I personally feel that the owners should be embarrassed by the level of service here. Avoid at all costs.",

I waited for 30 mins before checking back in with the host, who advised me that my table had been skipped?? I informed her that I didnt hear my name and she replied\" we texted you\" Well hell my phone dies after waiting 45 mins!!! LOL Anywho after the verbal altercation I had with the host she proceed to put me at a table on the patio which was fine. Until 4 random old ladies just came and sat down... I just wanted my food by this time...smfh. I sat at the table 15 mins before the waitress even asked for my drink.. When my food arrived I didnt recieve any silverware?? Like get it together HOT Taco. Yall are becoming greedy for money and treating long time patrons as a \"number\"",

When we finally had a hostess acknowledge us she asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside and when we chose outside she told us it would be at least a 15 minute wait when 5 tables were clearly open just dirty, so we politely asked if we could take one of those which made her roll her eyes and exclaim \"Jesus\" to us. We had someone acknowledge us at our table after asking after 15 minutes (not busy at all let me remind you) the food was good, prices were average but nothing was good enough to make my friends and I come back to eat again.... super disappointing",

Sometimes it can be very slow, but everyone is generally nice.   I know there is a huge weekend bar scene here. So maybe the food isn't their focus.

He grabs a few silverware sets, and doesnt say ONE word before he walks right back away. We eventually are seated, waited about 7 minutes to get a server, ordered a draft beer and a frozen margarita immediately! We waited for our drinks as the bartender was everywhere in the restaurant besides behind the bar. I had to get up to ask someone about our drinks after 15 minutes of this. We get them about 30 seconds later, seeing as how the margaritas are premade. Finally we get our food. The manager, Joel, brings our food. Brings me a fish taco with over half of the tortilla empty from the lack of fish. I send it back, he brings my plate back to me with a better taco. I eat my tacos, after about 10 minutes. I have to once again ask for 2 orders of rice and beans that I was missing.  Nothing about this experience was pleasant. I have never witnessed a manager with such a lack of care for his job.",

Waited 15 minutes and a server never even came to our table. Looking around, all Hot Taco employees seemed either unhappy or disinterested in working. The lone exception was the bartender who was constantly working. Looking around at the other tables showed customers looking around for a server. We left without ever having anyone come to our table. No reason to give a place our business when there's such apathy and lack of customer service. There's plenty of options around for Southwest, Tex Mex and Mexican food. I'm really sad because this place was once excellent. Now, it just seems like a poorly-managed shell of its former self.",

    "text": "This place is pretty new, and I get that, but it was a huge disappointment.   I live in an apartment across the street so I was so excited for this place to open. I got the steak taco and chicken taco..taste was very bland. Rice and beans were okay. I was not a fan of the food at all. I went with three other people. Someone at our table got the quesadilla which was not bad and the grilled corn looked pretty good.   The service was not much better. Our waitress was terrible but the \"water girl\" was on point. By the end of our meal we were ready to close out. We had three checks come to the table. Two of them were wrong, so she took them back and adjusted them. We then gave her our cards to pay for the food. When she came back, my friend was charged $14.99 for a $9 meal. My friend confronted our waitress, who then took the card back and said she adjusted it. She came back with what appeared to be a check that was charged the correct amount but when my friend checked her bank account, she was now charged another $15 on top of the $14.99. We're up to $30 for a $9 meal. She spoke with the manager who apologized and said he would fix it. He gave us his business card and told us to call him if it was still an issue on Monday.   So, Monday comes...and the $14.99 charge was still there. But now the $15 charge became a $29 charge... So now it's $45 for a $9 meal. How does that happen? We went into the restaurant later that day to speak with the GM and he apologized and credited her the money. He even credited the $9 for the meal, which he should have done the first time. He said it might take several days. All the money was eventually credited back but I still have no clue how and why this happened. It could have been an issue with their system, but it was most likely an inexperienced waitress.   Maybe I just had really high hopes for this place. It's a shame because they are at such a great location. I am willing to give it another try. I will definitely edit this review after I do so.",

All I can say is it conveniently located on \"Bland Street\" for a reason, because that is all my experience was: bland. I will note that all we got were margaritas, queso dip, salsa and chips, but I'll stand by the fact that you can usually tell a good Mexican food restaurant by it's drinks.   The drinks were weak, and watered down. The queso dip tasted like something I would buy in the chip aisle at the grocers. The chips were cold, and the salsa had no kick. After such a disappointing first course, we didn't feel like we wanted to try a second course.   The reason I'm giving it a three star review, is because I didn't try the food. It wasn't so disappointing that I would never go back. I would be willing to give it another shot in a few months when it isn't freshly open.   It has such a good location, and a fun decor, I still have high hopes that this place will turn itself around!",

The service was slow, but the manager acknowledged it and comped our meal. The server was clearly overwhelmed since they were understaffed, but she was still as attentive as she could be. The food was great and good portion sizes. I did find it odd that the chicken in my chicken fajita appeared to be grilled then chopped up into some sauteed vegetables, but was delicious nonetheless. I'm glad this place has worked out some kinks and I hope it continues to improve and remain a staple in South End. Now I can't wait for warm weather so I can enjoy Taco Tuesday with a margarita and some tacos on the patio.",

We had a second table pushed up to  our table literally .2 seconds after asking without being treated like it was a HUGE deal to be done.    The server checked to see if we had any questions about the menu. The food was out quickly and it was very yummy.  Between the 5 of us, we tried the Chimichanga (so good!), the pork tacos, the empanadas and an enchiladas.  We were all very full and very satisfied with our food.

Asked the server what it was and she said \"Chicken burrito with black beans, etc....\" And that it was a large portion on a bed of rice. A different waitress came to take our order because ours was getting her face painted for Day of the Dead. She told me a completely different burrito of the day. She did say that they would make it the same meat, though, if I wanted. I went ahead and ordered it and when it arrived, it was barely a lunch portion. And the rice was inside, not beneath. The manager (?) came by after the meal and asked if everything was okay, and I said no, and she said \"Ok\" and KEPT WALKING. Also, the Margaritas are pretty much flavored water. Won't be back. I left hungry because I wasn't about to buy a second meal to make up for what the first one lacked.",

Shrimp tacos had two small shrimp in each. Pork tacos had less than a tablespoon of pork in each. My wife combined her shrimp to get one good taco off the plate!    Even the margaritas are bad -- watery and overpriced. It's not even passable as bad drunk food.  It feels like that is all the new owners care about - patrons too drunk to care about the food or prices.  Save your money and go to Tavern or Phat Burrito.",

I had the chicken tacos and wow, they were very underwhelming.  There was a massive pile of raw cabbage on the taco, with a little bit of chicken on top of it, then the usual garnishes.  It was very dry and just bland.  The chicken didn't have much flavor at all.  The waitress warned me when she brought the salsa out that it was outrageously good and very addictive.  I thought the salsa tasted like crap, almost like store bought.  There are way better options around.",

The food temp seemed like it was sitting for awhile. I'm not sure what is going on with Hot Taco in regards to food not coming out hot. The service was great and our waitress was excellent, but the food not being HOT really disappointed us.   The manager came out and apologized. He also took care of the bill. I want to give them a second chance but it seems others have been since our visit so I'm apprehensive. I think this place would be great for drinking but not eating. Kinda sad since there are so many great options for dinning in this area and I hoped finally we would get a great place for Tacos. I guess we will wait and see if the reviews become positive before visitng again.",

Well if you enjoy being in someone's personal space to get the attention of the bartender then this is your spot. They rarely make eye contact with you and it's always 3 or less behind the bar especially for this to be a busy place. The first time we attended a separate event that included this place and others. The second time was doing a national event. Food wise: first time, food was cold and the second time there was an 2 hour wait to be seated with a lot of tables empty. Food was average. Drink was watered down. There were not many waitresses/ servers to begin with. I probably will never go back.",

No hostess, no one behind the bar, no server to be found, no manager, no greeting. We stood there at the entrance near the bar and waited for about 5 minutes before realizing that this must be the reason hardly anyone goes there. Besides the food being subpar, customer service seems to be at an all time low. Just before turning away and leaving a CUSTOMER yells out \"you can just seat yourself\" ...ahhh no, thanks though.

We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender for a while who was friendly. We, of course, went with some of the $2 tacos. I had a chicken and a beef taco and they were both pretty good.

To be seated, for (cold, tasteless, ridiculously thick and stale) chips and salsa, drinks, and entrees. This place takes advantage of the fact that they have a great location. That is all they have going for them!  Nachos were dry, fish in fish tacos had no seasoning, and everything had cheddar cheese in it. CHEDDAR CHEESE. At a Mexican restaurant.  Lastly, this restaurant has NO kids menu, and seemingly no easy way to modify any dishes. Our server was baffled by our \"chicken and cheese burrito,\" and we were given a chicken and rice burrito covered in queso. This is after another server had to chase down our server and inquire as to what she meant by our obviously complicated order. I don't think it's too much to ask to have a kids menu at a Charlotte restaurant. Our other entree was wrong as well.  We tipped our server well(always do with kids in tow), paid our bill and agreed to never return.",

    "text": "Hot Taco wasn't bad but it wasn't outstanding either. I would say it's a pretty typical Mexican style restaurant. What I did enjoy was the atmosphere. The restaurant itself was huge and a lot of fun. They had great decorations and the way it is set up is pretty efficient. It's like a big open room but there's a dining area and then the bar area and the bar is separated by some booths.   The food was average. I got tacos in lettuce wrap and so did my boyfriend. They were pretty spicy which I didn't expect because t did say that. And we also got a free appetizer from checking in on Yelp which was awesome! We got the queso dip which was actually pretty good. I couldn't get enough of that!   The margaritas were stroooooong! Definitely recommend those if you like tequila. Overall not a bad experience and I'll probably be back at some point to try some of the other menu items.",

The service has certainly improved, and i LOVE the apps (stuffed jalapenos, queso, etc.), but I have yet to be impressed by the drinks.    The margarita menu is awesome (from the looks and details) - but I've now had a few different ones made by different bartenders - and the verdict is the same... I have no problem paying top dollar for a great marg with good tequila, but if I keep returning and continue paying top dollar, I don't want a watered down, plain, weak drink :-/  Might try it again for the apps - or ask for a shot of tequila and assemble my own marg?  Idk...too bad because the ambiance and location are great.    This place has potential.",

The place was pretty empty and we grabbed a table outside on the patio.  For drinks, I got the house marg and my hubby got a beer. The house marg was nicely sized and made very well. Who doesn't lobe margaritas when they come out in glasses the size of your face?!?  For dinner we split the chicken fajitas. They were half off (Wednesday special) making them $6....holy smokes what a deal!!! I thought they were plenty for the both of us. Came with beans, cheese, rice, tomatoes, sour cream, onions, peppers, and chicken (with 3 tortillas). I loved the refried beans!  Thought the chips and salsa were excellent as well!!  Just realized now there was a check in offer for a free tizer....next time!",

Me-#7 combo as well. Veggie Taco was Ok. Shrimp taco was ok but tiny shrimp and the ratio to filling was off. Beans was good. Disappointed in my chicken enchilada. Queso fresco was barely there.  Points for having Cholula and salsa verde. Lots of TVs  Glasses were refilled without asking.  Needs improvement: food could have been a little bit warmer and rice could have been a little firmer. Also it was cold to me inside. I wonder if that had any effect on the food temp.  Will come back and try again to see",

The service is horrendous. I should not have to wait at the front desk for 5 minutes when I look out into the seating area and only see 5-7 tables sat. I also shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes once I'm at my table to see a server when there are only 5-7 other tables sat. The food is mediocre and the recent menu changes have increased the prices and reduced the value of most entrees on the menu. The drink specials were the only saving grace but it appears that there are new 'rules' around what can be ordered and by how many people so that's the final straw for me. The new servers walk around with attitudes and look miserable working there. Sabor is just down the road and a much better option!",

We also had Mango margaritas. The food and drinks were so good. I ordered dessert to go, I got the fried cheesecake which was horrible when I got home but maybe it's because I waited 2 full hours before deciding to eat it. The skin of the cheesecake was like the burrito skin. The cheesecake itself was good. Maybe the skin got soft and was not crunchy anymore. I would def come back again and give the dessert a second try.",

We both ordered the 2 tacos for $8 deal. Both fish. Like with the some of the other reviewers, I was expecting a tiny nugget of fish in my tacos and BOOM that's what we got. It was no more than 2\" long encased in two really dry corn tortillas about 6\" in diameter. The fish nugget was hidden in a 2\" pile of thick shredded lettuce. 10% fish, 75% lettuce and 20% very dry corn tortillas. Just plain awful. I ended up picking through it and barely could finish it. Very bland. Nothing to hoot and holler. I guess this place would be good after a late night out of the town. But if you're better off saving your $ finding a taco truck for more bang.",

At 25 we were looking at our watches, with the main concern being there had been multiple tables cleaned and available for a bit at this point. I work in a restaurant so I understand \"dead sections\" but on a Saturday night, really? Anyway, we finally got our table and were sat with a really friendly server. Food took about 45 minutes to get (it's fake tacos) so no matter how busy they may be I know there is no way that this type of food could have taken that long. Once our food got brought out I was missing a core ingredient that separated my \"specialty\" tacos from the \"house\" tacos, not to mention my meal was brought out about 5 minutes after the other 3 at my table. To top it off, there was a drunk table behind us the entire time causing a ruckus and after an hour into the dinner when the bouncer? finally approached and started to kick them out, he instead ended up cutting up and taking selfies with her. Our server was super sweet, yet weeded the entire night. She forgot our chip refill 4 times, not that that was ever a big deal or we ever asked for one, but more salsa would have been nice to help out the flavor of my bland fish tacos. Cleary the management here is not up to par or are more interested in cutting up with problem customers than helping/relieving their employees.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere ...absolutely HORRIBLE service. I am amazed at the shit show that my friend and I experienced at this ( I use this term lightly) ...restaurant. Read the past reviews and believe them when they say this establishment does not have a clue how to run a restaurant. Once we sat down we were welcomed...check...given our menus...check...server was very nice...check...we are on a roll.. . she explains the drink specials ( Mimosas on a Friday Night...odd) but whatever...so we ordered two lime margaritas on the rocks. Tick, Tick, tick, 20 minutes later our drinks arrive with a basket of chips and salsa. Okay so the drinks were great. She asked if we wanted to order. Busy catching up we asked if she could give a few minutes to look over the menu. If I knew then what was to come...Tick, Tick, Tick ...20 minutes, Tick, tick tick..30 minutes goes by...Tick, Tick Tick...40 minutes no sign of the waitress. In fact, she was nowhere on the floor. Keep in mind we still have not placed our food order and it is over an hour since we were seated. I try to catch the eye of the young waitress who was waiting on the customers in the booth behind us. Eventually she looked up and came over to the table. I asked if she could find our waitress for us. She asked which one we told her the name and she walked away. Guess what...Tick, tick, tick 10 freaking minutes later our waitress approaches our table and asks.....wait for it..\" Has anyone taken your order yet?\"...Yep you read it correctly. OUR waitress asked if someone ELSE took our order. By this point my nice demeanor was wearing thin ..\"Please bring us our check this service is horrible\". Her response \" Okay\". She walks away. No offer no apologies. And............Tick, Tick, Tick... freaking 10 minutes later we get the check and she disappears again. Never to be seen again. My friend lost her cool grabbed the check and walked up to the bar which at the point was told \" I am sorry I cannot checkout your bill at the bar you have to pay your server\". Deep breath..in and out..in and out then we told her what our experience was. Still no dinner. The bartender was very nice she comped us one of the drinks which was fair and apologized. We left and went next door to the American Pub and had amazing service. In fact, the manager stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our drinks and if we needed anything. We told him we had a horrible experience at Hot Taco, which he then explained they were owned by the same company. I was dumbfounded. The same company and we had two extremely different experiences. Hot Taco you have serious management issues. You will not succeed in Charlotte if you continue to go down this path. I will never recommend this restaurant. I am interested to see if I receive a response. That will be the True test of the level of customer service. I would highly recommend American Pub because the entire staff and the Manager took the time during a very busy night to make sure we were taken care of. Good job American Pub.",

We were there on a Saturday night and although it was busy, it was not packed. Our first drinks came quickly along with chips and salsa...which was delicious.  After that we probably didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes. Our first drinks were long gone...we were starving and had been ready to order well over half an hour prior. We were so disgusted that we decided to just leave but the waitress brought our bill and never returned again. 20 minutes later we eventually settled up with the bar. Graciously the bartender removed one of our drinks. So needless to say the hour and a half wait I experienced was not worth the 1 mediocre Margarita! Went next door to the American pub and told our story..the staff was all over us. The manager even comped our first round of drinks and appetizers without us even asking!!! Now that's were I will frequent",

The mini margarita was cute. It was as strong as I expected for $2!  As for the tacos- I ordered a chicken, pork and beef taco. The pork was my favorite but none of them wow'd me.   But for the price everything was a ok. You really can't beat this deal...I had three tacos, a mini margarita and chips and salsa for less than $10.   I want to try the queso and a few other tacos so stay tuned for my update.",

Our server never came to our table except to take our order. The only other visit she had was because she dropped her nose ring and was searching around our table to find it! WHAT A MESS! We had to ask the lady who dropped our food off for more waters and silverware!   The chips were fried in the oldest oil and had the worst taste! Yuck!   The tres leches cake was so dry and you could tell they did not soak it and poured the \"tres leches\" liquid on to order! Then when my dad mentioned how it was not even a traditional tres leches at all and complained to our server she goes \"it's our American take on it\"  BAD!",

On Tuesday's they offer $2 tacos and weekends are $2 mimosas and $6 pitchers!   My bf ordered a pitcher of mimosas for $6 & i got water. We split the steak, chicken & shrimp fajitas. Cost was $19 and had to order an extra set of tortillas because originally only came with 3.   Ordered a side of guacamole...which turned out to be $9! for a small cup! wasn't notified that it was considered an appetizer at all and kind of disappointed in that!  Food was good only thing was the chicken was a bit over seasoned for me...a little of on the salty side.   But overall, it was good! and will deff come back.",

    "text": "Probably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.   I don't say this much because I used to be a server and know that some things can be difficult in a restaurant. But from start to finish, there was not one positive experience. When we first got there, we waited 15 minutes for someone to seat us. Server after server came by the host/hostess stand and kept saying someone will be with you in a minute, until finally one server decided to finally seat us.   We ordered drinks when sat down. It took 40 minutes for us to get our drinks. It was absurd. We kept asking the server where are drinks were and she kept saying the bartender was behind. We finally got our margaritas. They were the worst margaritas I have ever had. They were extremely watered down house mix with tequila. I guess they were running low on the mixer and added water to make it last longer. My margarita was basically a clear liquid and tasted awful.   Our service was one of the worst I have ever had. She was apologetic about all the delays which I appreciated. But she kept asking if we needed anything. We asked for water three separate times. She forgot each time and kept came back asking if we need anything. We finally had to grab another waitress to let her know we needed water. She brought the waters to our table in seconds. Our sever never noticed we got waters. She acted like she didn't care. When we ordered off the menu she didn't seem to know what any item was. She had to look off our menu to write down what we ordered.   The food was mediocre at best. It came out cold like it had been sitting out for a while. It took us about an hour to get our food. So we waited 40 minutes for drinks and an hour for our food.   I will most definitely not visit this place ever again.",

I told the hostess that they should hold the table of 4 open and wait for the other table of 4 next to it to open for us and she said they can't do that because then everyone would have to wait.

    "text": "In town for a short visit with our baseball working Funkette.  She picked us up at CLT-Douglas about 11AM and we decided on a quick bite for lunch.  Hot Tacos it was in the Old Southside neighborhood.  So it's $2 Tuesdays...that's $2 Taco's and $2 \"mini margarita's\". Lots of choices on the taco front... from fish, to chicken, carne aside, pulled pork, Koren, shrimp...you get the picture.  Hard shells, soft corn, flour...you pick that too.    Baja Fish - Flakey white fish grilled, blackened or fried. Served with pico de gallo, citrus slaw and spicy seafood creama.  Pretty good but the pico really cooled down the fish pieces just as others have stated.  Al Pastor - Hand pulled pork with pineapple, onion and cilantro. Good flavor, but the pork was on the fatty side.  Tobasco Chicken - Pulled chicken with citrus cabbage, cilantro and topped with Tabasco creama.  Hot and spicy.  Camarones Caliente - Fried shrimp tossed in house made hot sauce made with Tapatio and Ranchero salsa, Bleu cheese slaw, tomatoes and fresh scallions.  Tasty but not enough shrimp.  The mini margarita's were basic yet met our expectations for what eight two-bit pieces of silver should get you.  We three shared four.  Chips and salsa were decent but we've had better.  All in all would the lunch command a repeat?  Sure, why not.  The math was easy to figure the bill.",

However, everything we ordered took forever to come out... Drinks, appys, entrees.... Even though it wasn't very busy (around 1pm on a Sunday) As food and drink did come out, virtually everything was initially delivered to a different table or had stuff delivered to our table that we hadn't ordered.   While everything was able to be sorted out, it was just sad how mediocre all food was.   Guacamole was a grayish green (I get this color when I make at home and have left overs that I mix up the next day), unspicy and unsalted.  Street taco sampler was rather bland and unmemorable.   Chili verde carnitas were ok, but greasy and lacking in flavor to be found at MANY more capable taco shops.  Margarita tasted like it was based on a mediocre mix and tasted like there wasn't any alcohol.",

Our waitress, Chanel, was extremely sweet and fast, so she was tipped accordingly. However, the food itself wasn't good at ALL. I don't believe in taking money off a tip just because the food isn't good, as it's not the wait staff's fault.  My friend and I decided to split the sampler plate, which includes 5 of their specialty tacos. Decent at best but nothin that made either of us decide for sure that we wanted what was served. We also had the grilled corn, and this was the only thing decent. It still wasn't as seasoned as it should've been.  I ordered the two taco + 1/2 quesadilla meal. All bland. My friend didn't enjoy his taco salad either. He said that the chicken on his salad LOOKED seasoned but it wasn't.  Overall, I wouldn't be mad if someone said to me \"you can't ever go back to Hot Taco.\" Wouldn't fight or resist it in the slightest.   I seriously wouldn't be surprised if they closed within the next year or so. The location is way too awesome for them to be there offering subpar food.",

    "text": "Considering my husband and I live within walking distance of Hot Taco and there is no other Mexican options in South End, we decided that we should finally give this place the benefit of the doubt, with hopes of having a convenient place to frequent when we get the craving for a taco.  I held my expectations low because, I have been thoroughly disappointed with \"Mexican\" food in Charlotte since moving down from PA.  However, I was hoping that it would be at least decent enough to take advantage of the great drink specials that they have.    First impression as we walked in, the interior is aesthetically pleasing, and the music was enjoyable, so far so good.  We opted to sit at the bar, and it was filthy.  There was salt and sticky drink rings all over. The bartender was kind and good at what she does, I think her name was Joy and when asked, she willingly wiped down the bar for us - so no complaints from a service perspective.    Next, we ordered a draft beer and she politely told us that all of the drafts were out... ?  So, we ordered two Modelo bottles.  There was rust/funk around the rim, so we asked for glasses to pour them into.  No surprise here, they were entirely flat.  Next comes the chips and salsa.  The Chip plate she gave us had crusted cheese all over the bottom.  The chips and salsa themselves were respectable enough to have over a drink at the bar.  But the food was not worth it.  So on to our orders.  My husband and I both got a combo platter.  I had a cheese quesadilla and a beef taco and he a pork quesadilla and 2 beef tacos.  The beef was completely bland, no flavor at all.  The cheese quesadilla was stuffed with some type of colby jack cheese, not the type of cheese you get in a real Mexican restaurant... but I guess I was not expecting that considering this would be more of a tex mex then anything.  Anyway, the pork quesadilla was the best out of all of our food, but nothing to rave about.  Too bad! I really wanted this to be decent!  Tacos el Nevado and Three Amigos will still be our go to, even though it takes more effort to get there.",

First off the the actual physical space is very cool, sweet decor and a very active vibe.  We went on 4/2 about 6 pm on a whim to see if we could get a table for ten for a friends birthday.  Realizing it was Final Four and UNC was on it 9 we figured it would be tricky...They said they would get us in and would be about 20 minutes.  After an hour we were seated, got chips and salsa right away....Then took another hour to get drinks, I realize the pi** poor staffing and lack of any type of management and a ridonkulously slow kitchen are in no way the servers fault, but after three hours and not even getting all of our apps, the birthday boy in our party inquired as to what the hold up was, , and the server turned her back and left for another table we had some pretty valid concerns - two large groups seated well after us were eating.  She threatened to call security, she didn't realize our birthday group was a table of Police Offers, we decided to leave money for our one round of drinks and got up to leave, then someone (manager may haps??) told us not to worry about it, so we gathered our money and left.  Worst dining experience I have ever had, and it isn't even close, over three hours to get one warm corona and guacamole...Pretty sure they don't have a manager and if they do, there were never on the floor once, must have been hiding in the office, while his poor staff was getting destroyed, two tables next to us, also got up and left before getting food, they were smarter than us, they only waited 2 hours.

I ordered the baja fish taco and the side ordered the asada taco. Both tasted great but the meat in both of them was lukewarm, and it didn't Ysidro long for our food to arrive. Margaritas were excellent. As far as the length of time to be waited on, it was a little slow, and they were not busy.",

    "text": "I like reading reviews on yelp, not write them but my experience was so terrible last Saturday at Hot Taco that I just had to.  My two friends and I decided to come to Hot Taco because we were feeling like drinking some mimosas and enjoying the beautiful weather on a patio. We were greeted by a young lady that I can only assume was either high on something or just didn't care because everything we asked her, her answer was delayed like she didn't even know how to respond. Mind you we were not asking anything out of the ordinary. We asked the hostess was there any seating outside and she replied \"I don't think so\"  After seeing the confused looks on our faces I guess she decided that maybe it was best to actually go look before making that assumption.  When she came back to take us to a table outside(I guess there was a table available) she asked another young lady to seat us and that young lady shook her head no. I guess we should of known then that this wouldn't be a golden experience.  After being seated, the hostess brought to our table some chips and salsa. After that we saw no one else. No server came to take our order or bring us water, speak to us, wave to us or acknowledge us in any way. We thought maybe they were busy. We understood because we too are in the service industry but no, every table that got seated after us (3) was greeted right away and brought waters. After waiting for 15 minutes I went to the hostess stand and asked was there a reason no one was coming to our table. Once again blank emotionless expression and delayed response. She walked away to talk to someone and I walked away to go back to my table. After waiting a few minutes more, we then decided that it was best we didn't eat there but we did want to let the management know of our awful experience. After seating ourselves at the bar and asking to speak to a manager, Gabriel came out. You can tell by how he was walking over to us that he was uncomfortable. We told him what happened and he told us that he had just got there at 1pm and that they were short staffed. Out of the servers that did come to work, most of them were hung over (his exact words).  He then asked what did we want him to do fire his employees. That was not even remotely close to what we said. We just wanted to alert him to a problem. He then offered to buy us an appetizer but after dealing with being ignored and then this pathetic excuse for a manager we decided to just leave. After reading several reviews I see that being ignored is commonplace at Hot Taco. It's a shame because we love it here but I guess we have to find another place to get our mimosa and burrito fix.",

I had the chicken tacos and taco quesadilla and even though it was enough for me I feel like the portions were very small and the chicken was very bland. Also the margarita tasted more like the mix than tequila. I went for the 1 year anniversary and as I much I loved getting a sombrero to celebrate they had no food specials only alcohol specials. Also the service was awful. I hardly had a waitress check up on me to see how I was doing. Overall I'm very upset with the outcome, mostly being my first time there. My first impression is 1 star and I don't plan on going back. Wish I would have chosen another place to go to.",

When we arrived at hot taco there was a wait, so we went to the bar. The bartender was extremely nice and attentive, we got some drinks and she was nice enough to bring us chips and salsa. When our table was ready we asked to be moved to a booth (I had two large men in our party, the table was a bit too small), the hostess rolled her eyes, sighed and said I can clean one off when I get to it. So after watching her clean our table, I had to ask if it was ready. We sat at our booth for 20 minutes without an acknowledgment, literally nothing so much as a hello. One of the people in my party let an employee know we hadn't been served and she said, let me check on it. After another 10 minutes without service we decided to leave. On the way out, we let a few servers know about our situation, they could care less about he poor service, like the rest of the staff. It doesn't matter how average the food is, if the employees don't care for our service then they don't deserve mine.",

I've worked previously as a server in a very successful restaurant where the food is great but not only that, the servers are positive and want to make the experience enjoyable for diners. My two cents, there are other better places to eat and get great service at.

The kitchen seemed overwhelmed and confused as we watched and waited for our food to come out lukewarm and flavorless, there is a guy with dreadlocks and ho hat cooking in an open kitchen (health department violation). This place has to be one of the worst concept ideas in restaurant history and now that there is a petition to have them remove the statues in front of the entrance I think it will be interesting to see how long until it is closed and revamped.  Definitely a huge miss for the Bottle Cap Group on this one, but I guess that sometimes some ideas look way better on paper.",

    "text": "Just went for dinner earlier tonight...two thumbs DOWN! Hot Taco used to be somewhere I liked going to occasionally for a meal with friends. Service has never been great and food has been mediocre, but it's been a fun spot. The reason for my negative review is their decision to get rid of their salsa bar. Their salsa bar was half of the reason I went there! I really loved their green tomatillo salsa. Munching on some chips and a variety of salsas while enjoying good drink specials made Hot Taco worth going to. I was very disappointed to find out they removed their salsa bar but I guess it's a cost cutting thing. Not good from a competitive standpoint as Southbound recently opened up nearby and they have a salsa bar (although I heard it's pretty bad). Still, a sub par salsa bar is still better than no salsa bar. I also thought Hot Taco changed their menu from the last time I was here a couple months ago. I was surprised that pretty much all meals on their new menu are going to cost you over $10 (several in the $12-$14 price range). For some reason I remember Hot Taco being cheaper before. Hot Taco just lost a customer by taking away the salsa bar and using a more expensive new menu. I'll only return if they bring back the salsa bar...and it better remain free!",

The final straw was this weekend when I ordered a bowl of queso (the only bearable thing on their menu) and after waiting 10-15 minutes, was given a very small bowl (smaller than their normal size-think the size of ranch dipping), still charged $7 and they had changed the queso without warning me when I ordered it!! It tasted like the Tostitos jars of queso. Never giving my money to this establishment again!!! The WORST OVERPRICED Mexican food in Charlotte.",

    "text": "First Time eating here: Korean Beef Taco - was tasty but lack a little salt or seasoning. The meat was cold, like less than room temperature cold. I ate my taco regardless.   Carnitas Taco : the meat  was the shredded, mushy style carnitas as opposed to tender chucks of pork. The mushy pork meat was soaked in a sauce with off flavor.   Asado Taco - tasty but the meat was cold  Refried Beans - was the best part of the meal  Mexican Rice - little  cold too and very bland  The manager didn't even come by the table but offer a free appetizer for next time.  Every one at the table was disappointed. I felt bad for recommending this place.   Did not enjoy the lack of customer service; I am always confused by places that stand by their food alone especially when the food is worth coming back too.  Probably will not go back here again since there so many authentic Hispanic and Latino restaurants around with much better preparation and  better seasoned food.",

    "text": "Wow, this place was pretty disappointing!   I came in around 2 today with some friends, so it wasn't busy at all. I think, besides some people at the bar, we were the only people seated. With a check-in, you may get a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree which is very generous. That was the best part of the meal today. Because there was 3 of us, we got 3 different appetizers. I really recommend the corn! The portion size for the empanadas is quite generous, but it just reminded us of pizza rolls. Overall, appetizers were good. The water there tastes a little funky, I would get a soft drink.   For entrees, we all got tacos and quesadillas. They have this combination of 2 tacos and a beverage (between 11-3) for only $8! I thought it was a great deal; however, the food was such a disappointment. I ordered a steak and deep fried fish taco. The steak was burnt for me and my friend so it was brought back to the kitchen. The taco itself wasn't really good, it lacked a lot of flavor. I didn't even get a deep fried fish taco, it was just seasoned so they went back and got me another one again. The rice and beans that come with it are ok, nothing special.   We then decided to give dessert a try. We got the tres Leches cake which was good but very dense. We also got the churros. The churros are good without the chocolate dipping sauce. The sauce tasted kind of burnt.   Comments on service: Our server was very nice, however she seemed new to everything. We had to repeat ourselves many times when ordering. She just didn't seem very alert or there. Someone from the kitchen came out and apologized about our food which was nice. I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon. It's worth a try though, so don't let the review hinder you from going.",

    "text": "I came to eat here during their \"soft opening\"/trial run.  My bf was a partnering designer from Interiors at Southend.  We were asked to join in on their practice run.  The space was cool and hip...very tastefully done.  The waitstaff was on their game and didnt miss a beat with refills on chips, drinks, or salsa while we waited for the food.  The food was delicious!  The portions were mighty and the temeratures were right on.   The rice was a little spicy hot ...and I'm sure they will adjust that in the future.  I love spicy....but people who shy away from spice may find it a little tough to take.   The queso dip was really really great...it was like \"designer\" queso...not the typical run of the mill white stuff you get at the order by number places.  All in all, my experience was spot on and i enjoyed my time at Hot Taco.  I will definitely be back after they get going on Monday.    Good Luck Hot Taco!  You look great!

    "text": "Despite the poor reviews this place has received, some friends and I stopped by for dinner one night last week. I am glad we ignored the low ratings; I thought this place was great!  The vibe is casual; kind of teetering on the edge of hokey with its decor, but no big deal. The service was great; our waitress was super friendly and diligent about checking in on us, and our food arrived quickly.   Now, about the food: it was REALLY good. I'm not sure if previous reviewers have extremely high standards, or if I have extremely low standards. In any case, I have no complaints about anything I ordered (#11 and taquitos appetizer, for the record). My dining companions were very happy with their meal as well (although I can't recall what they ordered).   I live a few miles away in Wesley Heights. To this point, if I wanted tasty Mexican food, I'd drive to 1900 in Elizabeth. I actually think 1900 is an eensy bit better but the convenient location of Hot Taco, combined with my positive experience, has it currently ranked as my new go-to Mexican joint.   I hope future meals here are just as good as this one, for myself, as well as other diners.",

    "text": "The nicest thing I can say is that they stay open later than Phat Burrito. I'm kinda surprised they have such cartoonish statues of stereotypes out front but the other decor elements like the antique lamps over the main dining area are reminiscent of my travels in central Texas. I like the separated booth area in the middle, as it's pleasantly far enough away from the bar that should a crowd 3 people deep develop over there you won't feel that someone's elbow will end up in your plate because the booth is on a riser.    When we came in I was more peckish than hungry but none of the appetizers appealed to me that night though they did have a good variety available. I went with a 3 chicken taco plate and it was unremarkable. In no way was the food undesirable, it arrived quickly, it was warm, though we were ordering late, the chicken wasn't over cooked or gave any indication it wasn't just made. From a flavoring perspective there was nothing distinctive about the meal. Since I wasn't ordering among their collection of tequila's (sadly they don't have my favorite Clase Azul like Vida Vida) the only reason to order a chicken taco here than phat burrito or chipotle than: Is it after 10pm ?  Since we were here after 9pm on their first week the place was slow and service is finding its way still. When our waitress left for the night no one was assigned to us. I had to wave down another table's waitress to get the check, once I had my card in the folder while we waited for someone to pick it up 2 different people came by to see if we wanted refilled water and third person came by to take our plates. Finally I took the check to the bar. Only after I signed the check I realized I had been given the completely different bill. So it took more time to find a manager, void the wrong check out, go through our original waitress's open checks, find my correct order and rerun my card.  Pregame here or stop by on your way home on the lightrail to sober up because the food so far isn't much to remember.",

We ordered our beers and decided to start with the empanadas. The empanadas were delicious! They were fried perfectly and came out piping hot. I would recommend asking for additional sauce to dip them in. I suppose I'm a bit of a sauce hog. If it's served with something, I like to have the flavor with every bite. If you are the same way, you definitely need a second serving. Then, we moved on to the tacos. We decided to split 3. 2 tacos will cost $10 and 3 cost $12. For only $2 additional, who wouldn't get 3? We ordered their new Bang Bang Fish, Korean Beef, and Carnitas. Warning: when they say spicy, they mean SPICY! The Bang Bang Fish was incredibly spicy. If you don't love spicy food, that taco is not for you. The Carnitas had decent flavor but wasn't anything I would order again. Then the Korean Beef. Not good. The Korean/Mexican BBQ sauce was extremely thick and the pickled cucumbers did not compliment the sauce. I don't usually \"leave money on the table\" but we left that Taco to be thrown in the garbage. In the future, I will stick with the Empanadas. The Empanadas earned my second star and are the only reason I will return. (Seriously, they are that good)",

She passed the menus to the other girl & we went out to the patio. Waited forever for service, drinks, food and checks. Oh, but don't worry.. the service was everywhere talking amongst themselves. Ordered the chicken quesadillas. Still confused if I had salted jerky pork or chicken? The marg was horrific. Raspberry flavor... no, more like salted syrup.   They have some SERIOUS work to do.",

    "text": "I have never been disappointed with this place! It is so clutch! Always good for Taco Tuesday's and typically always good for brunch. Nothing too fancy so if you want to gather around with friends or simply looking for a place you can grab a quick bite to eat...this is it! I love the fact that they have fish tacos, a hot sauce bar, and sometimes a salsa bar. Unlike most places, the drink specials cater to every acquired taste from beer to mimosas to margaritas etc.   My most recent visit was for Taco Tuesday. I can sometimes be turned away from this place simply due to the extremely long wait times, however recently learned you can put in a reservation in advance via YELP!! I ordered the bang bang fish taco and their new cauliflower asado taco. I love how you can choose between flour, corn, and lettuce tortillas. We enjoyed many 4 dollar double margaritas. The house flavor is good but the mango flavor is even better! I did step out of the norm and ordered the street corn as an app but think I can live without it. It wasn't bad but simply wasn't the best I've ever had.   I will always recommend this place due to it being a spot where you can enjoy good food and not break the bank!",

I loved the fact that they had a live DJ inside and a music with seating outside..it was summer time when I came so the weather was perfect and it was very busy...great taco options being that I don't eat any land meat and a great variety of tacos to choose from for a whopping $2. What made my visit not so pleasant is I parked my car in another establishment parking lot and came out to no car...needless to say it was one of the most expensive taco dates I ever went on because i had to pay for my car being towed..  Although this was not Hot Tacos fault, I would advise to take precaution on where you park your vehicle when visiting this establishment",

The Baha taco was terrible. The fish was BLAND. NO Flavor at all. The dish came with a side of beans and rice. The rice was bad. The black beans had no flavor.   I ordered a drink. It was decent, but being the most expensive item on my ticket, it wasn't worth it. I also didn't like that the glass it came in wasn't clear. Think about it, aside from the mugs of a Moscow Mule, you can see your drink. And most of it was ice.   The Mexican street corn was decent. Overpriced at $7 for two ears of corn. I won't be returning. My friends gave more favorable ratings, but \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is right on the money.",

We were able to order quickly and staff was nice. They kept on bringing out fresh batches of chips and salsa that we all snacked on. They were okay, chips weren't greasy and salsa was average.   After about 30 minutes, we asked about our food and went ahead and said we needed it to go. During this time, two different servers asked if we wanted individual bags. Eventually we got our food and had paid.  Once we got back to the office, the food itself was unappealing. I didn't even take a picture. I got a shrimp fajita burrito bowl and there was just too much going on. There were so many sauces and cheeses, all the flavors didn't blend together from the seasoned rice to peppers, ranchero sauce and queso.  I felt sick after eating it and one co-worker threw a taco away.   And the environment is strange. I don't care for the sleepy Mexican statues and snakeskin booths.   I'm not a fan. Food took too long and just wasn't good. But hey, there's alcohol specials. I didn't get to partake in those even.",

Uh, yes, our food please.  1:10 after witnessing tables that were seated after us get served, we asked to have our food boxed to go as we had to return to work.  1:30 opened the take out boxes of food and found the most bland American-Mexican food we had ever had.  Will not be returning.",

It's amazing how different the food tastes when you put a Latino in the kitchen. Especially since it's a  Hispanic themed restaurant. All rightee then! They've gotten their kitchen sorted out and everything is good. So give them a try and let us know what you think. Many thanks to Tim the manager. ddc",

Had the fajitas (streak/chicken ) were good but ... didn't even get a choice of flour or corn or refried beans or black beans before the server walked away. Seemed to be her thing walking away as your talking. Didn't get a welcoming feeling from her or the hostess upon arrival. The steak a little dry, good chicken. Service was Kinda pricy for what you get unless you come for Taco Tuesday. So overall meh food and not a great attitude for customer service think it wasn't our place",

We ordered guac for an appetizer ($9) and that came out a good 10 minutes after we ordered it. My buddy ordered the steak fajitas, two of us ordered chicken chimichangas, and another ordered enchiladas. I should have timed the wait, but it was to the point where we all asked ourselves twice where the food was. I saw tons of plates sitting in front of the kitchen not moving for long periods of time. Finally we saw sizzling fajitas coming our way, but they were given to a table that was sat long after us. Turns out these were our fajitas and the ticket was labeled wrong. The person bringing our the food was visibly pissed off as they were throwing a mini tantrum in front of the kitchen about the error. The rest of our food came out a few minutes later, and we waited another 10 minutes for new fajitas. My chimichanga ended up being a burrito, as it was not fried. They took half the cost off the fajitas and comped a beer. The waitress was nice. The kitchen seems to be lacking severely. There are countless other Mexican places to get better food and better service.",

There's also a $12 one that is HUGE!!! We shared that with FOUR people!! It would not be possible to eat that all in your own! So if you're looking to have a good time and save some cash up this place is highly recommended!! Oh and the food tastes AMAZING!!!! That was the craziest part for sure!!!

    "text": "Servers need to be trained better. And it's making sense after seeing Management for Hot Taco. It's clearly someone with a minimum amount of experience who is easily overwhelmed. I'm so annoyed with Hot Taco, I'm not even going to waste time listing all the problems we continually have at this establishment. I'll upload pictures. But a brief summary is an hour wait, as more than 7 tables were empty because \"they notifying people of their tables and giving them time to get there\". At one point, I asked management if the two tables by the bar were bar seating, or if they are just not being used. She gave me the same excuse above and said we had 4 groups ahead of us. By time I walked back to my group, they notified us that our table was ready. Then sent us outside to a tiny table in the dark. That was followed by a 20 minute wait for a server to acknowledge us. Followed by incorrect orders to come out after an additional hour wait. Followed by checks being incorrect. I so badly want to blame this on Tuesdays being busy, but I've been during the day at other times with barely anyone there and the service still sucked. They need new management and training for servers. Also, one of the female bartenders.... I won't throw her under the bus, but your prejudice is showing. Stop treating customers of different ethnicities so starkly different, right in front of each other.  Sidebar: I asked for no cabbage on my tacos. There was cabbage on the tacos, and a side of it. I honestly thought it was a prank until.i asked the server about it. She said she knows I said no cabbage, but she had them put it on the side in case. I told her it was on my tacos as well, and she asked me why I hadn't told her. I can give you a few reasons why I didn't tell you there was cabbage on my tacos.   1. You left and didn't come back for 30 minutes. 2. The food has already taken an hour to come out, and that was in addition to the hour it took for us to get seated, and the 20-30 minutes we waited to be acknowledged. 3. I wasn't going to risk having to wait any longer to eat. So I picked off what I could.   Ridiculous.",

Once we sat down, service was fast, but inattentive and the food was okay. The tacos were lukewarm and the beans/rice combo were cold.

The food was served very quickly, and the service was prompt.  The resultant itself is pretty large with plenty of seating -plenty meaning at least 80+.  There is a bar if that's your thing, with tables and booths.  It's located right by the track of the light rail and not obviously visible from the main street behind; its nestled with a handful of other awesome restaurants in a small strip.  Overall prices were reasonable, and the experience was good.  I thought the quesadilla was a bit bland, though I'll likely try something else next time I head back.",

The buffalo shrimp taco is not to be missed as well as the Guacamole! This coming from a person who just started eating avocados thoroughly enjoyed the fresh Guacamole. They have a lot of seating and would be a nice place to hang out one evening because the vibe looks like it would be a great one! Also if you Check in on yelp for the first time you get a free appetizer bonus!",

They change the 2 taco menu just to the basics like any other taco place. The female manager was very rude when it came to problems with the food. My friend had a bay leaf served to her in a taco clearly you know to take it out before serving to a guest. The manager made an excuse & said that's what we seasoning the food with. Of course you do but the proper way to serve the food is to not have that on a plate . Our server was great really active but this place needs to do better",

Neither one had any clue the other was waiting our table. We got 2 waters each, but they kept leaving before we could put drink orders in. Eventually I had to go to the bar to order drinks over 15 min after we had been seated (we started a timer). The second time I went I made a reservation since we were a party of six and after telling the hostess we were here she didn't communicate anything with us, but left us there, confused, for a solid five minutes waiting at the stand. A line even started to form and no one was coming back to help anyone. Once we were finally seated our waitresses seemed like she would rather be doing anything but serving us.   Overall the service really took away from the great food and atmosphere. I will probably keep coming back just because it is the closest taco place to me, however they are in big trouble if someone else enters the market.",

We both had a different margarita from the menu. I took one sip and couldn't drink anymore it was so gross. I even overheard someone at the bar send his drink back. The salsa was great but we didn't get more than one single cup. I got a beef and chicken taco and a half of a chicken quesadilla. Everything was horrible besides the beef taco. The beef taco had some good spice to it. The white cream on top tasted like Clorox. Our waitress was even worse. She hardly checked on us and took about ten minutes to bring us one beer while the bar and restaurant was empty. At that point we decided to ask for our check since we didn't know if we'd see her again. The only time she cracked a smile was when she handed us our check and said bye. I wouldn't return to this place even if someone was giving me a free meal. It's sad that something so poor is in such an awesome location in south end.",

The hostess desk was a ball of confusion unable to make a decision on whether there was a table in the patio while numerous were in view and  available.  The food was painfully bland.  Guacamole lacked any flavor and  the chips were extremely greasy.  Tacos leaked a water like substance while biting into them, probably from the pan where the meat soaked.  Taking 3 seconds to allow this to strain off before slopping it into a shell would help.  There was zero seasoning on the taco.  It's really difficult to ruin a taco but they succeeded.  It also became humorous to watch the hostess attempt to deliver food to wrong tables repeatedly.  Evidently she does double duty.  I imagine those peoples' food was cold because it did a tour of the dining room first.  This place is severely lacking management.   I imagine it will follow suit of The Greek Isles that closed.",

By the time she came back to take our order it had been another 10 minutes. We weren't sure when we would see her again so we ordered an appetizer and our entrees at the same time, as well as another round of drinks. When our food finally came out 20 minutes later, our appetizer and entrees came together yet we continued to wait for our round of drinks. The empanadas were cold, tacos so soggy that they tore apart when we tried to lift them, and the taquitos were simply rolled fried tortillas that had no filling. Finally, our drinks came half way through eating. The food and service were lackluster at best. We certainly caution anyone from going and will not be making a return visit.",

You could not really tell the difference other than the texture of the meat. It as was bland and luke warm. We also ordered one of their signature dishes a stuffed poblano pepper. Halfway through it was cold. And also bland. Bland and cold do not make good Mexican food. Really need a do over here.",

    "text": "I have never reviewed anything in my life but after my experience here I feel inclined to.  The server was fine.  The problem was the food.  I got the Seared Tuna Tacos.  When it came out it was 2 tacos and each one had 2 small slivers of tuna on them (about what you get on top of a piece of sushi) with a little slaw under the tuna.  It said it has a teriyaki glaze on them and I didn't see that or taste it.  Absolutely ridiculous for the $12 price tag.  Then when I got the bill I found out they charged $1.00 more because I wanted grilled corn instead of beans & the corn was maybe a 1/4 piece of corn.  This place will be closed soon if they don't change their ways.  People work too hard to waste their money.  The owner of this place needs to go to either Krazy Fish or Cabo Fish Taco to learn what a real fish taco looks & tastes like for a better price also!  This will be my last time!",

The waitress who took our order didn't write anything down, so I repeated it twice just so she would remember. I ordered the blackened fish tacos both soft, it came out one hard, one soft and the chicken was just grilled, no seasoning whatsoever. My wife the same, one hard one soft she asked for mushrooms on hers and so they rudely took the plates back to fix them. She returned with mine and my wife's 10 mins later. I again said that my fish was to be blackened and they said that was their version of blackened. Folks it had no seasoning on it at all! The waitress was rude and spent most of the by the kitchen talking to the other staff. It took 10mins to get her to give us a to go box and another 10 mins for the bill. I would hate to be the person/group who put this restaurant together and have it get terrible reviews mainly because of the staff. This is the face of your business! Hire some people who take pride in their jobs. I wanted this to be my go to Taco place, the food is decent if it's prepared the way you want. The service is absolutely terrible. The ownership needs to come in and clean the \"front of the house\" and start over. You guys are loosing $$$ because of this.",

My order ended up being wrong and they gave me a chicken taco instead of carnitas. The mimosa was really good, 10/10 recommend getting one if you stop by. My friend orders a burrito and it was huge. Like the biggest burrito I've seen in my life. You definitely get what you pay for here. If you're hungry and you've got a big group, this is a good place to go.

All their tacos are $2 each, and they have a Mexican beer that is $2 as well as $2 margaritas (smaller than normal but still a decent size). Dinner (and drinks?!) for $8? I'll be there.   Other things that I like - they recently added a salsa bar with 6 or 7 different types of salsa. It's got a really great avocado salsa, plus some others that aren't necessarily unique but still, variety is good and I think this new addition really kicks the whole place up a notch. Also, tacos can be served on corn, flour, or lettuce wraps. I personally go for the lettuce and I haven't seen many other places around town offer that as an option.     Cons - service can be a little slow and parking there on the weekends can be tricky sometimes. But, overall, a good spot.",

Hot Taco ..... love the tacos, they have a Late Night $2 taco menu, $2 taco Tuesday and during a regular day try the taco sampler so you can enjoy variety of tacos.   Margaritas always a good look!   Pros: Pork Taco!!! cheap tacos, nice variety of tacos, sauce var, has tons of tequilas, tvs all over to watch games, patio to eat & drink, next door to other fun spots, free parking and rail access.   Cons: late night menu is only 4 diff tacos and two other offerings, Guacamole wasn't good.",

We sat at the bar while we waited for a table. We were there for 15 minutes but were not once acknowledged despite our efforts of getting the bartenders attention. No water. No drinks.   We were shortly moved to a table. We waited 20 minutes for chips & salsa which came from the manager. Still no water. We waited another 20 for water. The manager said she would be back to get our order. 15 minutes later, we decided we had to leave. It had been a whole hour, and our order hadn't been taken.   The manager did give us free appetizer coupons to use on our next visit. Sadly, we won't be back.",

We waited to even be acknowledged by a hostess for about 5-6 minutes. There were MULTIPLE empty tables inside as well. The hostess told us it would be ten minutes to wait to sit outside. We went to the bar to wait, where  the bartender told us she'd be with us soon. After about 10 minutes, she still never came to us, let alone anyone at our end of the bar. As we waited, the table outside let, but two girls walked up to it and sat. So our table was taken. The hostess never even said a word to us. We just left. Horrible business. Don't go",

    "text": "Good food and great service! My husband and I ate at Hot Taco on a Friday night and took advantage of the $3 Corona/Lt. special. Our server was very thoughtful. As soon as we sat down and gave her our drink orders, she informed us that she had a large party getting ready to order. We were able to order our food at the same time as our drinks, avoiding a potentially long wait.  The queso and salsa were delicious. My husband got the Fajita-rrito, which was okay - the steak was tough. I had three tacos: baja fish (blackened), orange shrimp, and el pollo. The blackened baja fish and orange shrimp were really good. The chicken was a bit bland, but nothing a little salsa & queso didn't fix. The tacos were paired with a generous amount of rice and beans, which is always appreciated. Overall we had great experience and we'll be back.  ----  This is an updated review from 11/2016 and I'm so bummed to update... this used to be our go-to taco joint in Charlotte. The orange shrimp and Korean beef were two of our favorites! Tonight we went to have our usual and found out that they changed their menu. Both tacos were omitted, and you can no longer mix and match tacos with the meal. Our server, Lauren, was great and informed me that you can order your tacos a la carte with one side and the cost is roughly the same (however only includes one side instead of two).  After we received our food we have to say the quality of food is very different from what we used to love about this spot. The tacos had very little meat. The fish lacked flavor and the ground beef was extremely salty. I communicated my unhappiness with Lauren and spoke with a manager, who ended up comping my food. I was very appreciative of the kind gesture but also disappointed in our experience. We were told a phase two of the menu will be available soon... until then I don't think we'll be back. Again service was awesome but the food is not what it used to be.",

The second time the service was much faster, and she actually knew the menu (her name was Murphy, ask for her). The food was still spot on, and I have to say it may have tasted a little better.   I recommend Hot Taco. But not their desserts, save your sweet tooth for a specialist.",

I got the nachos and my husband got the the biggest taco i have ever seen, i forget what it was called but it was HUGE. They were both good. Typical Tex Mex food. I cant say it was extraordinary it was just like typical mexican food. They also had a hot sauce bar which i loved, it had all kinds of different hot sauces you could choose from. I got the champagne margarita which was delicious. The spicy margarita, was not good at all, it was more sweet than actually spicy and it was like fruity sweet not even margarita sweet. I did not enjoy that one at all. Overall is was a good tex-mex restaurant. Oh yea they were also out of a lot of alcohol that we asked for, which was frustrating because if they have it on their menu they should have it in stock. Also the prices were pretty pricey for the food and drinks.",

If you go sit at the bar my experiences there are usually pretty good in all areas of service food and drinks. In fact if I could rate the bar and dining room separately I would. The bartenders have always seemed knowledgable and are always friendly. The food has always made me happy I LOVE MEXICAN FOOD and to be honest I'm not really all that picky about it I could it all day everyday. The chips and salsa are amazing they are always freshly made and the salsa is amazing. They have great specials for drinks and food all week long $2 tacos on Tuesdays and half price fajitas on weds (I think).  The only thing that has consistently disappointed me has been when I've sat anywhere but the bar (haven't tried the patio yet) I sat in a booth the other night with friend we were so excited to go there for the $2 taco and margarita night. It took forever to get sat they said they were letting the kitchen catch up..... To what I don't know because the place was only about half full maybe a little more. The only thing that was busy was the bar... Much to my dismay.... Finally we were sat things stated out ok but it just seemed like we could never get our server when we needed her. The food came out great and at a good pace so it seemed they had caught up.  And as a friendly tip stick to the drinks they know I ordered a vodka soda... Seemingly simple enough...but it came out in a large margarita glass, my immediate thought was ooook so I'm gonna have a ton of soda water in here, so I tried it and it was a little vodka and a ton of just plain tap water really gross :/ I asked our server if hey could remake it maybe the carbonation was out and if I could have it in a rocks glass so that it wasn't completely watered down. She replied they were out of rocks glasses and walked off soooo I assumed I was getting the same next time.  It came out this time in a rocks glass with NO VODKA in it. I repeat NO VODKA only soda water.   Needless to say there's a lot of good things they do but when you go stick to the things they do good. Pretty good food and cheap drinks that are on their menu.  Parking can be an issue at busy times but overall a good stop in for drinks and food we'll be back.",

By 9pm we hadn't gotten our food, and when we asked we were told there were 3 tickets in front of us, so it would be another 30 minutes. At this point the table next to us who sat down after us was finishing their dessert. at 9:30 we asked about our food again and were told there were two tickets in front of us. To which we said, please cancel our order, we've eaten so many chips we aren't even hungry anymore. Offering no apology whatsoever, it took them an additional 20 minutes to bring the check for our drinks. Who knows how the food is, you may never get it!",

I absolutely love a place that picks a theme and sticks to it! That said, there's no mistaking the Mexican fiesta happening here.   Seven of us arrived Saturday in the midst of lunch but the place was nowhere near capacity. We were seated pretty quickly and given water, chips and salsa right away. (A must at a Mexican joint, right?)   After ordering drinks, our server was pretty slow about returning to get our food order. An understandable offense if the location is very busy but given I don't believe Hot Taco was even half full, this group of hungry girls got a little anxious.  The food is typical Mexican fare - nothing spectacular. We were tickled and impressed that they warm the queso in a mini skillet over a burner when they bring it to your table. Genius!  Oh - don't try to mix and match tacos - they're not having it.",

To jump right in....We asked for another chipotle ranch to go with our appetizer, no one told us that we would be charged.  Upon getting my ticket I asked the server why was I charged without prior notification.  Her response was very rude, stating that \"I would assume that I would be charged because it's taco tuesday\" apparently she's been working in the industry for a long time and this always happens  (from her words not mine) very unprofessional.  It doesn't help that the service is always extremely poor at this restaurant and they're doing nothing to fix the issue (I give up)  Not to mention me reserving my place on yelp only to get there at the said wait time, to wait 15 additional min with several empty tables.  Who's hiring these people?? More importantly who's managing this place to continue to allow it to go downhill like this?? Three people that were with us said they heard the service was bad and prior to coming one person not affiliated with us also said the service was extremely poor (and yet we proceeded to patronize this establishment). I guess the rude comments from our server proved it times 10. With mediocre food and drinks (the chicken is pretty salty and the margaritas are a little weak) it surely doesn't help with service and poor attitudes.  Currently searching for a satisfying  Taco Tuesday spot.  This just isn't it.",

Took them 20 minute to get us semi cold beers!! On3 important factor here.  The place was EMPTY ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.  While the neighboring bars FULL.  I KNOW SEE WHY.  This isn't like a THEY ONLY DID US thing.  Everyone waited a while for BOTTLED BEER.  MAY I ADD that the limes were also old and not a drop of juice on them?  Bartender seemed annoyed when I asked for a better lime.    Also...when we got in, the table behind us was leaving.  That table was NEVER CLEARED in the almost hour we were there.  We also ordered food.  I must say I have no complaints there.  Food was good.  They didn't honor the HALF PRICE MARGARITA FRIDAY that was clearly on the menu either.  After paying asked to see the manager.  A manager that did not introduce himself by name when no did and expressed my recent visit.  All he said was sorry.  Sad bc it's a nIce looking place but the young staff is HORRIBLE with one exception, the gentleman that brought us more tortillas almost immediately after ordering more.",

Arrived at 630 and didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes. Server was attentive and friendly. They still validate the free app with check in on Taco Tuesdays as well - SCORE!!   I got a mini margarita, two tacos and guac for $6.50 AFTER tax. I mean come on?! You can't beat that. All of the tacos are eligible for the deal and you can get corn, flour or lettuce for your tacos.   I recommend the orange shrimp and seared tuna tacos! I was full after two tacos and an app, but with no app, you'll want to order three as your \"meal.\"   When I say they were yummy, they weren't Cabo Fish Taco good.

This last visit, we came on a Monday evening... 6pm... so fairly early.  We were seated right away.  From the looks of it, the restaurant was only about 25% full with a small group of people doing happy-hour on the patio outside.  Our server was super attentive and got our orders in... this is where my visits usually fall apart... but the food actually arrived in a decent amount of time!  Someone other than our server came by to check on how our appetizer was and then our server came back to see if we needed refills and how our food came out.  Things were looking up for this visit... until the rest of the dinner crowd came in.  We were done eating and drinking and there was a good period of time before we were given any attention.  No fault to our server, I could see her working hard and attending to a lot of other tables... but maybe her section was too big?  Were they shorthanded?  Mind you when we finally got our checks and closed out the restaurant was maaaaabbbbbyyyeee 60% full... I could see why people that visit on weekends got so frustrated with the service.  Not sure what the solution is - but it seems to be a lingering problem.  I can understand if this place was brand spanking new, but this guy has been around the block for a while now.... I would expect it to be a well greased, tex/mex slinging machine by now.",

I'm a nurse your nails carry so much bacteria and they are curling around into people's food! gAG!I asked for our Margaritas we ordered a while back and she said \" oh\" the walked away. She finally came back, dropped our drinks and walked away. We called for her to tell her about a wrong item that was brought, we also needed silverware and napkins. She kept walking. Another waitress brought us over silverware and napkins.   We were so turned off between the hygiene and attitude. Needless to say we will not be returning. What a a shame. Looks like a cool place but lacks everything else.",

    "text": "Don't waste your time frequenting hot taco. You're in South End for goodness sake, you can find somewhere else to eat and drink.  First of all, hot taco is amidst a few generic restaurants with reasonable food and drink, but for some reason it thinks its an upscale latino restaurant. The menu items and price point put it on par with a nicer uptown venue, but the food quality is really quite poor. I ordered \"nachos\" which were literally a pile of chips with sequestered clumps of sour cream, shredded lettuce, pico, and black beans dumped on top. Honestly, probably the worst nachos I've ever had. The only redeeming factor was the salsa bar (shout out to the avocado verde salsa, you deserve better).  Additionally, the drink menu is lacking a bit in the beer department. I ordered a Day of the Dead Amber - which was actually quite good - but was disappointed to have it served in a bottle with no glass. I did have a margarita, and I thought it was good quality for the value.  Beyond the subpar food experience, I was really blown away at how poorly run the service is. I couldn't even tell who our waitress was, as multiple servers came up to our table asking if we'd been helped yet. It seems like a free-for-all with the wait staff, and I recommend snagging whoever walks by if you need something. \"Our\" waitress took our drink and food order, and the nachos came out a good five minutes before our (wrong) drink order showed up. I could not believe how disorganized the entire service process was.  Don't bother. Go to Helles and Dunkel. Go to Babalu. Go anywhere but here.",

    "text": "I didn't have any issues with the service, since my boyfriend and I came at around 8:45/9pm. Our waitress was attentive and got our food out in reasonable time, but came by three minutes after taking our order to ask if she took our order already and double check what we asked for, so I could see how the service could be bad when the place is crowded. Other than that, we didn't experience any issues with service!   The food was good! The Korean BBQ taco didn't taste like it was marinated in anything remotely similar to Korean BBQ sauce but it still had the smoky kick that I look for in BBQ. The ahi tuna taco was good, charred on the outside and raw and soft in the middle. The rice and retried beans were also good, the refried beans being better than most that I've had at my usual Mexican places.   Overall, I'd recommend anyone to give Hot Taco a late night visit. I enjoyed sitting outside and people watching while I ate my tacos, and would come again! This is a prime people watching area, since there are a hefty string of cool restaurants in the area and it's always bustling!",

We ordered some queso to start.  It came out in a small skillet and sat on top of a tea candle that did absolutely nothing.  I get the thought behind it but the cheese congealed faster than we could eat it.  Not cute.  I got the fish tacos.  I thought everything about them was pretty skimpy.  The pieces of fish were small and the toppings were virtually nonexistent.  The rice and the black beans were both pretty uninspired.  At the time, this place did offer a coupon for a free appetizer with a yelp check-in.  Our server was nice and took pretty good care of us.  I would probably try another place in the area before returning to Hot Taco.",

After our waitress took our food and drink orders, we didn't see her again until an hour later when our food finally arrived. (It wasn't crowded.) We had to go up to the bar and ask for water refills.   As for the food, I ordered a burrito with chicken, steak, and shrimp. The portion size was massive, but within expectations after seeing the price of the entree. It was okay, but I probably wouldn't order it again.

    "text": "Holy packed Saturday, Batman!  I was craving queso, so I kidnapped my buddy Reido and headed to Hot Taco. It was super busy today and there was a little bit of a wait. No worries, we posted up at the bar. Our bartender was buried in the weeds between a full bar and tickets shooting out of the service well, but she handled as well as can be and with a smile on her face. Kudos to her, I would've been miserable.   Though tempted by the mimosa special, I channeled my inner adult and stuck with a Coke. I got queso and the #9 combination. The queso comes in a little cast iron skillet that sits on a stand over a lit candle to keep it warm. My combo plate had two empanadas, two stuffed jalapenos, two tacos, rice and choice of beans for $12. There's a ton of protein and wrapper (including lettuce leaf) choices for the tacos. I did a blackened fish (you can also get it grilled or fried) with a flour tortilla and a beef with corn tortilla. I enjoyed both tacos, but the fish was my winner. The jalapenos were stuffed with chicken and cheese. I was full, but couldn't stop myself from eating them. Fish tacos and stuffed peppers will definitely be must get items for me when I come back here.   Things to know: kids eat free on Mondays (with a purchase of an entree), $2 tacos on Tuesdays, and various drink specials every day. There's free parking with two different lot options. Hot Taco also has a nice patio area that's perfect for people watching in South End. Make sure to check in on your Yelp app, right now you can get a free appetizer!",

First, we kept getting calls back saying they were out of things...either update yoour menu online saying that you don't sell these things anymore, or make sure you actually have the items that you sell in stock? How are you out of corn....at a Mexican restaurant? Once we got our food, my wife had the taco salad and it was decent, we both thought the flour taco shell tasted gross though, like it was fried in old oil. My enchiladas came with no sauce, no toppings as described in the menu, just some bits of shredded cheese...with gross black beans and old crunchy Mexican rice. The guacamole had no salt or lime, just blended avocados topped with tomatoes, the chips were stale, the quest wasn't bad though. All in all, seems like a classic case of a place that's all show and location, but the food is garbage.",

Unfortunately, we were greeted with an hour wait for our party of 8 at Futo Buta, so down the tracks we wandered. (Don't worry, we didn't actually walk ON the tracks.) And, behold... Hot Taco! I know what you're thinking... This isn't going to end well. But, I'm here to tell you, I think Hot Taco might have turned a corner!   After reading so many bad reviews, I was nervous and might have grumbled a little bit when our dinner plans changed from delicious ramen to questionable Mexican, but again... Really pleased with the experience at Hot Taco! Service was spot on. Several friendly waitresses dealt with our drunk shenanigans and were super attentive. Chips and salsa came out immediately. Drinks were fairly cheap. ($6.50 for the house margarita.) Menu offered the usual Mexican fare -- tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc. I had the mole chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Solid plate of food! Ted had a burrito that was only slightly smaller than the state of Texas.   I hope Hot Taco has hit their stride after a bumpy opening! I'm certainly excited to have a new spot in South End to stumble into after a few beers and regret staying away/judging a book by it's 3-star rating for so long.",

The decor is great - bright colors and open.  Our server welcomed us promptly and we had drinks and chips almost immediately.    The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa was quite tasty - one of the highlights of the meal.    I ordered the korean beef tacos with black beans and rice.  I had hoped to split the taco order and get one seared tuna taco, but they will not allow you to mix and match - even though the cost for each dish is the same.  Okay, that's their policy and it's fine, but perhaps I would have had a better experience if I had other food to try.  The korean beef tacos were fine - but, bland.  I had hoped for a real burst of flavor with the meat - instead it tasted a bit like a beef taco with some lettuce and cucumber.  Meh.  Not bad, but also not necessarily good.    My friend ordered the skinny taco salad with grilled chicken - imagine a taco salad less the shell.  She ate about half of her chicken before getting to a section of the chicken that was pink and raw.  The server, manager and cook all came out to apologize and replace her meal - but we were nearly done at that point.  To compensate, they did comp her meal, bring coupons and a free churros dessert.  The grilled chicken was sliced before it came to the table - all they needed to do was look at it to see it was undercooked.  Mistakes are made, but raw chicken is a pretty big deal.  The churros were delicious.  Overall, the service was prompt and attentive.  I loved the decor.  I wish the food had impressed me more.",

We both left agreeing that we will never come back again.   We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly. She brought chips and salsa and our waters. When it came time to order, I was disappointed that there was no a la carte options. None of the dinner combinations had what I wanted but I was told that I could not add a single empanda, even for a cost. I was disappointed but willing to keep an open mind.   We ordered mimosas and I would tell you about them, but they never came. The manager and waitress apologized several times. We said it was cool as long as we weren't charged for them.  Now to the food. The chips and salsa were actually really good. Our meals arrived and I had ordered the #12- half quesadilla, enchilada and taco. My boyfriend had the #11- two empanadas, two stuffed jalapenos, and two tacos. We both were not impressed. The beef on my taco was room temperature. The enchilada had been laid on top of the beans so it was soggy. The quesadilla was something I could easily make at home. My boyfriend liked the stuffed jalapenos. He said his tacos were just okay and the dough of the empanada was not good. It tasted kinda like a funnel cake and was very greasy. Also, he ordered a pork taco and there were huge chunks of fat. In fact, we thought maybe it was a piece of shrimp but no - pure fat. I also thought the rice and beans were bland and left 95% of them on the plate.   I wanted to love this place. The location is great (although parking can be rough) and I had high hopes. But it was terrible. In fact, I would be surprised if this place stays in business. I don't mean that to be hateful but it is my honest opinion. Based on my experience and the other reviews, this place seems to be consistently bad.   If you are reading this and haven't been here, do yourself a favor and go to Maverick Rock Taco or Three Amigos instead (see my other reviews).   Bottom line: underwhelmed in every way.",

I'm not knocking my nephew's taco skills but he's not opening a restaurant anytime soon.   All I can say is when I saw the ratings on Yelp, I wasnt exactly surprised. But at the end of the day, tacos are tacos. Brought a few home to the wife, she wasn't enthused.   Skip.  UPDATE: tried HT again, waiter knew about me from my review.

The restaurant was busy but I don't think that is cause for us to be ignored.  The food was good but nothing really special or worth sitting through bad service for.  I would not recommend the tres leches cake.  It is nowhere near authentic or edible.",

One of our party (not me) made several completely inappropriate sexual comments, literally the epitome of the pathetic dirty old man. Quite frankly, I'm surprised we didn't get tossed, but again, Lauren handled it all like a pro. The service was timely, the food was good, and the tequila was flowing. Thank you so much Lauren for putting up with our nonsense and I want to apologize to you for having to put up with a creepy old man.   Lauren's a superstar. She needs a raise.",

The manager comes, takes my order, honors the half price, brings my food out me being annoyed and ready to get home after having to sit in the restaurant when not anticipated to wait on my order I find that my order is made incorrectly. It does no use to call as no one will address the concern I'll just sit on hold all night.",

They're not bad, but they're not that great either. I will say however, that if you're choosing to get a taco, the carne asada is the best one so far. I've had the three different types of snapper tacos (all really okay), the chicken (also decent) and the chorizo (which would be my next vote after the carne asada).  It is nice that on Sunday's they have a mimosa drink special ($1 mimosa glass, $6 carafe), however my waitress repeatedly said we would get from 6-7 glasses from the $6 carafe, but my husband and I only got a solid 5. On the upside, you could definitely taste the champagne so you're not getting completely ripped off.  I would say another highlight is the service. My waitress was very nice and attentive; but, if you're looking for a good bite this wouldn't be my first suggestion.",

You'd think the restaurant would be prepared for such an event.

At first, it took a while to get our drinks but once we got them they were okay. We can tell the bar tenders are busy so we wait until we are completely out of our margs to ask for refills. We wait for someone to come and then after about 20 minutes I start raising my hand. One bar tender tells me that she can't give me a drink because she's working the other side of the bar. I politely say okay thanks. In the meantime the other bartender ignores me, blatantly. The guy next to me is literally laughing at the situation because he can see she is obviously ignoring me. 45 minutes later I get the attention of the same bartender, so I say can you please ask the other bartenders if they could come over. She knew we had been waiting for a while at this point. She tells me \"nobody's getting drinks tonight\" if she does that. Rude response but ok. Then all these girls start huddling together and laughing, obviously talking about us. At this point it has become a joke that we were not getting served. I keep saying excuse me to the woman who is suppose to be our bartender. She finally decides to respond (and basically yells at me); She says that she can't serve me because she has to ask her manager first because my friend \"looked too drunk.\" This is a typical excuse you get from bartenders and bouncers who just want to discriminate. Also, how is someone who had ONE marg an HOUR ago drunk. AND her manager was there ten minutes ago so I don't know why she didn't ask her then.  I asked her \"why didn't you just say that?\" She had no answer. We left. I tried to tell the owner that all these girls were laughing at us but she looked like she didn't give a care in the world. Awful. Next time I'll spend my money somewhere else where the girls don't act like b*tches",

Zero flavor--not even salt!  Maybe the other menu items are better but I won't be back to find out. Service was as bland as the food.  Server looked as though she was in pain having to be there. No smile or greeting. Had to flag her down for any attention. Took over an hour to get order.  Do not recommend.

It's obvious when a restaurant views the place from the perspective of the owner rather than from the perspective of the customer. This place is all of that.  Lunch - no lunch menu. $11 for a burrito. Ok - fine, I can do an $11 burrito (once in a while) but what do I get? No vegetables? Look, there are many places where I can get the same $5 burrito. Qdoba, Salsaritas, Chipotle - even Taco Bell ! But what I can't get at those places is fresh vegetables. So you would think for $11 I'd get fresh vegetables? No. Not a one. Not even tomatoes and lettuce on top. Well then Mr. Owner - you tell me - why would I go here?  Taco Tuesday. Need I say more? The place IS A Taco Tuesday. The only reason to stomach it is because you only got $2 and it happens to be Tuesday. Stale chips - uninspired tacos - but cheap! Like a bad $1 drive though.   They changed their menu, now you can't get combination platters? Seriously? The one thing that may want me to consider coming back has been removed from the menu? Good job! Good luck paying that rent.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why everyone is so down on this place. Perhaps it's because I waited a while before starting to come here - who knows. I've been here a few times and find the drinks are both decently made and reasonably priced, the food has hit that Mexican sweet spot somewhere between authentic (like someone's mom is cooking in the back kitchen - my favorite type of Mexican food) and slightly upscale, and the vibe of the place is pretty neat as well.   My most recent visit was around 7:30 on a Saturday with a party of 6. We were able to snag a table on the patio very quickly and our waitress was attentive and quick with chips, salsa, queso, and drinks. While I stuck to import bottles and drafts, several partook in the $6 mimosa carafes (probably a liter a piece if I had to venture a guess). We ordered food and it came out about the time you would expect for a party of our size and time/day of the week. I split a fajita with my wife and while nothing blew me away, it was still a good dish. We were able to get our check easily and were well on our way without issue.  This has been a pretty typical experience for me whether it's after a Panther's game or my wife and I pop in while walking the rail trail with our dog (I highly recommend this spot to re-energize with a beer and some chips). I definitely plan on coming back and think Hot Taco has been a great addition to this booming area in Charlotte.",

Although i was on the phone handling an important call (which i try not to do because it is rude) my friend next to me was not and neither one of us were greeted. Once realizing we've been sitting there for about 15 minutes still not greeted i decided to say something. The bartender (some brunette) proceeds to be a smart ass saying \"are u ready or are u gonna stay on the phone!\"  being on the phone shouldn't of made u neglect my friend at least who was patiently waiting. It was very unprofessional of her. She clearly seen us, and purposely didn't at LEAST greet us due to me being on a call. After i heard her say something rude to another guest regarding US, i decided at that point i didn't want to spend my money there. She lucky i didn't get her name. She was very unpleasant and sucks for her because we are very good tippers. So for any professionals who live on their phone for work related purposes trying to work while grabbing a quick lunch, try somewhere else where people are a little more patient and kind and not full of themselves when they look like they don't need to be.",

The building contains 4 different locations, two of which were closed leading me to believe they're more for the nightlife scene. Hot Taco is on the northernmost end of the building.   We went in to find a very large space that was very well decorated. We were seated immediately and our waitress came out to serve us almost instantly. Our server was an absolute sweetheart. I can't remember her name, but she was absolutely lovely.   I had the tacos al pastor, which came with a choice of beans and red rice. The food was great. It wasn't the very best taco I've ever had, but it was delicious and very filling. We finished the meal with some churros, which were also delicious.   Overall, there's nothing bad that can be said about Hot Taco from my visit. The food is great, the prices are very reasonable, and getting there is super easy - it's right off the Bland Street Station. I'm hoping I have another reason to go very soon!",

I give this place 3 stars, simply, because it seems to have gone down in quality and service over the few years that I've been coming here. When I first started coming, the tacos were WAY better, until they changed the menu. This change brought on a lower selection of tacos, as well as less ingredients inside the tacos. I would say that my favorite taco was the Baja fish taco, which included a nice Baja sauce to compliment the fish. Now, the fish tacos no longer have the Baja sauce, and appear to have more of a dry texture. I had a few other favorites as well, but those tacos aren't as good anymore either. I used to come in every week, but that stopped once the menu changed. There are also quite a bit of workers there with a poor attitude, which makes things even worse. I'm not sure about anyone else, but I've learned in life, when you have something good, such as good food and service, you don't change it to lower quality food and bad service. That's a good way to lose loyal customers. I'm currently looking for a better place to get good tacos.",

    "text": "Ironically, I'm sitting in Hot Taco right now. My boyfriend and I came to get $6 margaritas (a Thursday special) on a whim. Truthfully, the experience was awful. We waited 15 minutes before the hostess even returned to the stand to talk to us, then another 45 minutes for a table. We then waited 10 more minutes for our waitress, who didn't return to check on us for another 20 minutes. We ended up getting 2 drinks and ordering a check. The $6 margaritas were not worth the wait (overly sweet and generic), especially given it wasn't packed. I won't be returning.",

At that point, we asked for our food to go. Got that and the checks at 6:20. Finally able to pay and leave by 6:30. Probably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize. Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing. Chances are, I won't be back. That is unfortunate, as we spend a lot of time in the area and this would have been a great outdoor spot! To top it off, when I got home and opened the soggy boxes, I was very disappointed at what I paid $11 for.",

Nothing special. I ordered 2 tacos with beans and rice. One of my tacos was supposed to be blackened chicken. There was nothing blackened about it. I didn't even dare try to eat it. I picked off a tiny piece and it was so bland. Blah! We got a pitcher of margaritas - kind of by accident - our server asked if we were ready, we said, \"Yes.\", and a few minutes later a pitcher appeared on our table. Oops. But, fine, we must have looked like we needed it. The margarita was strong. Maybe a tad too strong.  Not a ton of flavor. Just ok. I would not race back to Hot Taco. I'll probably stick with my tried and True Mexican hotspots!",

The guacamole, however, was good.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I could have had a better (and much cheaper) meal at Taco Bell.  Want decent Mexican in the greater Charlotte area?

We had to wait over an hour to get seated for a group of 6 when we went on 9/13. But you can get drinks from the bar and take them outside, so that made the time pass a little faster.

The prices are very reasonable, especially for the combination plates. I had a combination plate with 2 empanadas, 2 tacos and 2 stuffed jalapenos with rice and beans for only $12. Stuffed jalapenos were the best thing and dipping those and the empanadas in the chipotle ranch made them even better. The fish and shrimp tacos were pretty good, but a little bland as others have mentioned. Once I put some cholula on them they were good though.  We came on a Monday and they had the mini margaritas on special for $4. They were very good. Not too sweet and decently strong. They have a great tequila selection with flights available as well. Will try that next time.  Overall, nothing too fancy but certainly good for such reasonable prices. Service was great as well. Also, they have plenty of big screen tv's showing MNF at the moment.",

Then the fish, really light and flakey and spiced just right to get the smokey flavor that any Mexican fish taco needs. And the steak taco I had was really flavorful and awesome! Lastly the speed and the friendliness of the wait staff, the food came out right on time and the drinks were prompt. Our server Emily was so friendly and she immediately made us feel like part of this newly created family that wanted to take us on this food journey.

    "text": "So, I've heard nothing but bad reviews of Hot Taco. So naturally, I decided to check it out for myself for lunch yesterday. OK, OK - I held off until a \"Taco Tuesday\" so I could get some cheap tacos - how bad could they be? Even if it's Americanized \"On The Border\" quality, $6 for three tacos is a good deal.  I was pleasantly surprised. I had a Baja Fish Taco, a spicy shrimp taco, and their signature Muy Caliente taco. You can choose your tortilla style, or a lettuce wrap. I have to say that they all were great - not your typical Americanized Mexican fare. The Muy Caliente taco was by far supreme - a heap of roasted pork, cilantro, and queso fresco on corn tortillas (that was my choice of shell) - the pork was tender and full of flavor. Free housemade tortilla chips and tasty salsa were included, and if the default salsa isn't for you, there is a salsa bar with about 6 salsa styles and 30 or so different hot sauces.  And I didn't mention the $2 margaritas on Tuesdays yet, which weren't amazing, but certainly not bad. Yes it was a work day, but no, I cannot refuse a $2 margarita (or two).  I struck up a conversation with a couple of folks beside me at the bar and they were frequenters of the place, I'm guessing probably living in one of the nearby apartments. They said that the kitchen staff has gone through three changes since they opened, all for the better. They agreed that when Hot Taco opened, it sucked, but said that the restaurant has changed a lot since the first kitchen staff was there and the food quality has turned around completely.  This was my first experience there, but I have to say I was impressed given the negative tone of what I've heard about the place. So for anyone whose written this off as another non-authentic Tex-Mex place, give it another shot. You may be surprised. I plan on making this a regular Tuesday spot for lunch.",

Black beans were very salty.  I had the asada taco and the korean bbq taco.  The beef was flavorless, tough and chewy, and I had multiple pieces that were just straight up fat. The asada taco was essentially meat on top of american coleslaw that was not as good as what you get at most fast food restaurants.  The Korean taco was clearly the same beef but with a sickeningly sweet bbq sauce (no korean aspect to it that I could see) over huge slices of onions.  It was $10 for these crappy tacos.  We got the queso because of the free app coupon. It was fine but worth about$2, not the $7 we were charged before reminding the waitress about the coupon we had.  Service was friendly but very slow.  My friend and I both had to use the restroom afterwards.",

We were fine with outside, but noticed on the way in there's a lot of steps and high top seating on the patio. We asked if it was accessible where we could be seated immediately and we were told yes. The hostess leads us to the patio and straight to the stairs down onto the lower area, without even turning around. My wife had to turn around on her own and go back down the main entrance ramp and around the front to the side gated patio entrance. The positive is that it is handicap accessible. Once we were seated, our server was training another server and things seemed a little awkward. We didn't feel welcomed, more like just another table to get through. When my margarita was brought out it was dropped off on the other side of the table across from where I was sitting by the training server and just left there as she went on with what she was doing. When the food came out, it wasn't 100% correct as one of my three tacos was not what I ordered, and while presentation of the food was on point, the taste at this visit left something to be desired. Maybe it was the whole vibe of the meal covering up the flavor. Overall, location, atmosphere, design and decor are amazing! Taco Tuesday prices are great, too. I only gave 3 stars because this particular visit (my first) didn't stand out with service or flavor.",

Since we waited so long for our food, I went up to the bar myself and ordered a few drinks, all of which were better than average. The place with filled with hipster millennial southenders, who were loud and drunk-ish. There was a brosef birthday party in the back that was so vulgar that they made another group of hipster girls leave. With all this negativity, I will say that I ordered the (expensive) cheese dip and wow. Holy cheese dip, this was good. I mean, like lick-the-bowl after you finish good. So maybe just stick with a drink and some cheese dip at the bar.",

    "text": "Came in around 8 last night and the guy checking IDs by the stairs charged $10 entry fee. I've never paid an entry fee here so I asked what time they started charging and a few other questions to see if I'm dealing with a hustler. Upon realizing this was the case, our group proceeded to go next door and the guy stopped us and said he was just messing with us.",

Service was terrible. I would never recommend this place for anything more than walking past on your way to something better.",

Didn't know about the tortillas until Joy told another customer.    Heard awesome reviews about this spot & decided to stop by after work.  No time again soon. Awful!  Told the manager not sure how much that would do.",
