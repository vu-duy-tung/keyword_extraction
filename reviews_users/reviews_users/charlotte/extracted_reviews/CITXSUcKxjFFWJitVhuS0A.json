Their drive through process is so screwed up that getting ice cream is a pain- I can't imagine trying to wait for food with this set up. There is only room for maybe 1 or 2 cars to wait behind the person ordering in the drive through. Once you order you drive to the window and pay, then they toss a number at you and make you drive around to the front of the building. After 15 minutes (keep in mind we ordered one up of ice cream) I went inside to see what the issue was, only to find that they never brought it out to us and it was melted all down the side of the cup.",

It's rare now days to get good customer service, but they have perfected it at this location.  They greet customers and have a great attitude.  The restaurant is clean; including the bathrooms.  All fast food restaurants need to go by Culver's and take notes.",

I spent almost $25, and they of course forgot some of my items. I didn't notice until I got home. So, when I tried to call their phone to let them know, it rang a few times and went to voicemail. It's saddening when one of my favorite places can't even answer the phone. I probably won't be going back for a while because apparently no one is running the place. The food is great, but when the service is terrible, I'd rather go somewhere else.",

Pretty ridiculous system if you ask me... 20 minutes go by and all the cars behind us which was was about 5 ...ALL got there food before us!! So I go inside to speak to a \"manager\" if that's what you want to call him and I tell him what is going on and tell him id like a refund.. he doesn't seem to care that I am upset and he offers me free custard which I don't think is appropriate for how long we just had to wait for our food. I told him I wanted a refund and he then proceeded to ask me what we got, which I told him..and then mentioned that it's ridiculous that we waited 20 minutes to get our food while everyone else behind us got there food first. Again, doesn't seem to care at all...He goes over to look to see when the order was placed because apparently he didn't believe that I waited that along and then comes back and said to me \"it just hit the 20 minute mark and that I've been standing here for about 4 of those minutes\"!!! Really?!! Is this really how you are going to speak to a customer! This place has the worst customer service especially when the so called manager tries to argue with me and then still doesn't do anything about my unhappiness. If he is the manager then he should be fired... that is very poor to treat your customers like that! I will be calling corporate because I feel like the way I was treated and how everything was handled was unacceptable. I do not recommend this place to anyone... the food and service are both horrible!",

The fries, onion rings and cheese curds (more on these later) have always come out hot and fresh, like they were cooked to order.  The custard is excellent. I recommend not getting a shake, but instead getting a Concrete Mixer, as it seems to be more value for the price and isn't milky/melted like the shakes.  The cheese curds are great. Think fried mozzarella bites, but with a rubbery, squeaky quality to them. These are great. Their fries, while good, are \"just\" crinkle cut and not fresh cut, so I always get the Curds as my side instead.  Prices are actually pretty decent. You can get a burger, fries and drink (even if upgrading to custard, like I do, instead of a drink) will set you back around $8-12 depending on the number of patties or fancy toppings or premium sides.",

Hot fresh delicious. I like them. Better than 5 guys because cost and quality Culvers wins. Don't forget taste . Yummmmmmmyyy mmm mmmm",

For dessert ordered a mint chocolate chip shake and a pumpkin spice Shake.

The atmosphere felt relaxed, even for how packed the place was, it never slinked into complete bedlam. I was especially impressed with the gluten-free bun, which was savory and flavorful like it has been grilled in butter. Side note: Since this fast food joint permits open carry, expect to see patrons with pistols strapped to their cargo shorts. While this isn't much of an issue, being caught unawares of the situation could give you a slight shock at a family restaurant as you stuff your face hole with the delectable crispy fries Culver's offers. But this detail is trivial and by no means detracts from the place or prevents me from visiting the establishment again. If pressed, I'd say it only adds flavor of the whole Culver's experience. The one reason I dropped a star is because the ice machine didn't work and the iced tea was served warm. But, my wife loves the chicken.",

I've been eyeing the progress on Culver's since they started construction months ago. I'd never eaten here a day in my life but I had a feeling it was going to be amazing. And it was everything I wanted it to be and more. I came through the drive through and was warmly greeted. Took a minute to peruse the menu and asked for a suggestion before I placed my order. Per the pleasant cashier's suggestion, I opted for a double butter burger with cheese and no onion, fries and a root beer. The wait was short to get to the window and the pleasant demeanor never faded. She asked that I pull around as they prepared the meal to order. After less than 10 minutes my meal was delivered curbside. I almost waited until I arrived to my destination to eat it but for in order to give you my Yelp loves the quality review you deserve, I pulled over in the Culver's parking lot to devour my delicacies...you're welcome.   The burger was perfectly creamy and juicy piled with fresh toppings. The beef is not your average fast food patty. It is clearly from fresh beef and the perfect inconsistency of shape (and the obviously perfect fat to lean ratio in the meat) gave the edges a divine crispiness that is unparalleled. The fries were absolutely amazing. Perfectly salted, crispy and crunchy outside but hot creamy potato goodness inside. Then I got to wash it all down with a creamy root beer. Best of all this delicious meal set me back less than $8!!!   This place is quality indeed. This is now my new go to spot for a great burger in general.   Great job Culver's University team! You've gained a loyal client today.",

I heard very good things about them and they lived up to their hype. I was even impressed with the nice woman who worked the drive-thru.

Service is friendly & they bring your order to the table, which is nice, especially if you have little kids. The atmosphere is a bit cozier than most fast food places.  The location in front of Ikea is a bit tricky to get to. Coming down University from the East, go past Ikea Blvd and Zaxbys and turn in the Culver's driveway. From the West you have to hook a U-turn at the light and then go past Zaxbys, turning into the next driveway at Culver's. Otherwise you can take the scenic route down Ikea Blvd, make a U-turn and turn onto the road that runs behind the restaurants.",

I have to say that I really liked the sweet tea. It was perfect. I'd been passing the location near IKEA since it was built, but never had so I thought I'd go by today. The staff were extremely friendly to say the least. Maybe I'll try them again and try a chicken sandwich... who knows.",

The burger looked similar to Freddy's (but didn't match in taste) and according to the BF they didn't give much toppings (i.e tomato, pickles). It was okay but I will not be rushing back.",

I honestly was very impressed, and I would definitely get it again. The service is still top notch, and I do find it funny that, while Culver's is known for their burgers and their frozen custard, it's the other items on their menu - like the Reuben and the cod - that I think they excel at. I would recommend this to anyone, although personally, I would look beyond the burger menu and try some of their other dishes. :-)",

All of their burgers have that slightly crispy exterior while being nice and tender on the inside. They also have nice compliments to go with the burgers. The staff is very friendly and yet professional despite being mostly high schoolers and/or college kids. You can get a really good burger and be in and out in no time. Also, the shakes are very good. They taste like their homemade and not made from a powder like some places. You can't go wrong at Culvers.",

Dan, the owner, is a kind and driven guy with an amazing staff behind him. They welcome you and make sure your dining experience is everything that it should be. If you ever experience anything less than perfect, Dan won't hesitate to make it right. I would call the level of service at this restaurant \"the Chick-fil-a experience\".

There was a little mix up in the kitchen with my order; as they brought out the wrong entree twice, but the manager came over and gave me the second entree (the wrong one) for free, apologized profusely before heading back to the kitchen to get my order straightened out. It was only about another 10 min before my burger finally arrived, the manager along with it. He was very nice, even offered me a free dessert for my patience.   I ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger, the double, so it came with two patties, and a side of fries and a fountain drink. It was surprisingly very good for a semi-fast food restaurant. Enjoyed it, along with my company of friends. The manager then came back and gave me two menus full of desserts, even taking the time to pull up a chair and explain a few of the options. Very good service to make up for the mixups in the kitchen, made for an enjoyable first time dining experience at this Culver's.",

It didn't take long and the same gal brought my bag of food to me with a nice smile and I was off. I got about five minutes down the road before I started to wonder why they would have put the malt in the bag with the hot food. It turns out that they had not. I'll take come blame for that, I should have at least checked. Oh, well.  Burgers at home were perfect. Cooked just right and the fries were still nice and crisp.

Not your McDs or Burger King kinda joint.   My experience was pleasant, the line moved along, and plenty of seating available.  I liked the TV'S in the dining area, too (which I typically loathe).  Granted the place opened recently so it's in great shape; morever, my salad was prepared well (not artisan level but solid), the chicken tender and tasty.  Tip: nutritional information posted on My Fitness Pal.  A guy named Dan visited each table when things slowed inspecting how they're doing.  Discovered later he was the owner, blue hat, shirt, and everything. I like that.   I rarely eat much of their other stuff so I cannot comment, but if tempted I'd give that burger a try.  Or, the pot roast sandwich.  No, the fish.  Yes, with fries and a strawberry shake!",

Lots of people in the parking lot, and I went with the bacon cheeseburger with cheese curds. With a drink it came out to a little over $9. I asked for ranch instead of the marinara sauce that came with the curds and was told to drive up and wait for my food. A young boy (maybe 10?) came out with the food but when I saw marinara, I asked to replace with ranch. He happily said he would bring it out and I had to pull up more as the drive thru kept getting longer.  The burger was really tasty, for a fast food joint, it was good quality. The cheese curds were as good as can be!!",

That burger was so good! When we come back, I will definitely get a burger for myself. I don't know what their secret is but that burger was good.   The frozen custard was everything. They messed up my order but I didn't feel like being bothered with going back inside. I was supposed to get two chocolates but they only gave me one. They did give me an extra free custard with the order so I guess that is why I didn't go inside to fix it. They tried. But the custard is creamy and smooth and very flavorful. I just love custard.  And we ordered the cheese curds. These were everything too. I didn't want to share. Minus the initial shock of paying $3 and some change for a little serving of it - it ended up being a lot of curds in the bag.   When we want to treat ourselves I will definitely be back.",

You receive old fashioned customer service and you never feel like they are rushing you or that you are just a \"number\". Many other restaurants could take notice of training their staff as well as they do here. The location is great however I wish they would open one up near Concord Mills.",

We decided to stop by this restaurant location this past weekend as we visited Carowinds amusement park. We decided to utilize their drive thru and their staff was very courtesy and professional. Our food came out fast and hot. Everything was seasoned very well and both my spouse and I truly enjoyed everything.   I'm positive that we will be back in the near future. I would highly recommend it to friends and family members who want to have some good fast food.",

It appears clean and tidy in the dining area.  There is a sanitation grade of 97 posted near the registers.  The drink and condiment station was very tidy.  The floors were free from noticeable dirt and debris.  The restrooms were clean and smelled clean.     The employees were very friendly.  You order at the register, take a number, and then they deliver your meal to the table.  All of this happened as planned and in a timely manner.  Our orders were correct and warm.     I ordered a beef roast sandwich.  It was really good.  My wife got a single patty mushroom swiss burger basket.  It was also good and the fries that came with it were also good.  Next time I want to try the cheese curds.  They also sell ice cream that looks great and everything was reasonably priced.",

It was all great and had me wishing we had ordered more. Their house root beer was really good as well.   The staff was also very friendly. We'd never been before and the guy working the register gave some good recommendations and didn't rush us at all.   We'll be back.

You can ask for a taste test.  You can buy the custard by the cup or cone AND by the pint. 3 pints for $10.00.  Oh sorry, back to the \"food\".   I really like the burgers.  They have \"butter burgers\". My favorite is the cheddar butter burger with bacon.  I wish I could eat the double cheddar butter burger with bacon but I go for the single. My boys always go for the double burger.  Anyway you have to try the burger.  They have several chicken, salad, and seafood options as well.  Several sides allows you to add to any sandwich.   Stop by Culver's before you head into IKEA....you will get plenty of steps shopping the store where you can walk off any calories you took in!  Lol  Enjoy!",

As I got inside there was no one in line (except me) and 6 people standing behind the counter doing nothing. There needs to be someone giving the people direction (management).

This location is located on an outparcel of Ikea and depending on time or day may or may not be the easiest to access.

Each day in Charlotte, I would pass by signs on the highway that said Culver's was close by. I knew that I needed to visit one before going home.  I was delighted to find a Culver's close to where my hotel was. I decided to go through the drive-thru and get some dinner to bring back to the hotel.  The drive-thru is clean and straightforward. I ordered the bacon deluxe butter burger basket with fries and a regular strawberry shake. I then pulled up and paid. I got a number to place on my car's window.  The wait wasn't bad. There was a person ahead of me. Moments later, a person brought my food over. He was friendly and great.  I happily brought my food back to my hotel room after a good shopping day. The bacon deluxe butter burger was perfect. It was juicy and flavourful. It tasted so fresh. I have missed the crinkle-cut fries. They hold the ketchup so perfectly in all the grooves.   The strawberry custard shake hit the spot. You got real chunks of strawberry. It was so good and creamy.  I am so glad that I got my Culver's fix. Next time I am around, I will give eating at the restaurant a try.  (141)",

Sure, you could get a burger at plenty of other places, but they were just different.  Then along came Five Guys and Shake Shack and Smashburger and their variants. And of course if you were on the west coast, you had In and Out and the like. Now you have more of the midwest dairy style, like Culver's and Freddy's.  The primary driver here is certainly the burger - it's something like the smashed style of Smashburger, being that it's not large - but even better is that you can get custard too. And at Culver's, you can even find cheese curds. Nice.  When it comes to the burger, you can get about anything you want on it, and when it comes to desert, it's about the same. Just make sure you order it on hold - that way you don't have to sit there waiting on it for later. You get a receipt that you simply hand them later and they'll make it for you when you're ready and you can eat your burger (and curds) while it's hot, and you get your custard cold. Best of both worlds.",

They make \"concrete mixers\" which are basically like a blizzard from DQ. They have many flavors. Sundaes. Shakes. They got it all.   I've been to this location a handful of times, and always has good service, food made to order - coming out hot & yummy. I don't eat out a lot, and rarely \"fast food\" but this is a pretty good cheap burger and fries! *they have crinkle cut fries by the way, and they are the bomb dot com* (I love fries)   They are known for this custard, burger & fries. But they also have chicken tenders, salads, fish, and soups! I like that they offer side items such as fries, cheese bites, soup, salad, etc. with their combos at no additional charge. So say you want to swap fries for a salad. No problem!   Kid friendly menu, $4.99 includes entree/side/ drink (fountain, chocolate or white milk, juice box)/a scoop of custard with topping which you can use right then and there or wait til another time. Also \"scoopie token\" it's on the side of kids meal bag. You collect 10 and get to choose a Culvers football, soccer ball, volleyball or \"stuffed animal\" ice cream cone. I like this better than a wack little toy in each like some places (the yummy custard and choosing a sport related item eventually)",

We have never been there before and typically we go to Sonic. We went inside the restaurant is was very clean and the staff was very friendly. The menu look appealing so we ordered the concrete mixer and the special custard of the day. The custard was a very smooth texture but to me the flavor was lacking. I had the butterfinger concrete mixer and it was just okay. I wish I would have saved the calories for sonic or Chick-fil-A lol.",

While the service wasn't as quick as Culver's in WI, I'm confident they will get faster. I could tell that the team members cared and were trying to be quick / doing everything they could do which is why I gave 5 stars...besides the TASTY food of course.",
