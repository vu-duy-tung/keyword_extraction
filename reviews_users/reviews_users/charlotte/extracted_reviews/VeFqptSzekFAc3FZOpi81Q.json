The service was terrible we ordered cocktails 5 min before our dinner was ordered and our entrees came out before the drinks did. The Manhattan was average (coming from a former bartender that's being generous). As for the meal, my wife ordered the quesadilla and it was above average. I ordered the London broil which is one of my favorite dishes and was disappointed, the marinade was bland the meat was undercooked and cut incorrectly.   Overall we would not return which is a shame because we are in this area often for shows at the music factory.",

The staff is also very nice, no complaint there.  The thing is, I don't really have a complaint, I'm just not impressed with the food.  I find it acceptable, but nothing special.  In fact, the menu is, to me, kinda boring.  I think the point of this place is more to go \"have a few\" after work and such.  When looking for great food in uptown, this place wouldn't make my list.  I do love that it's locally owned and operated, however, and harbor no ill feelings.",

The bottom of the sandwich was already soggy by the time it got to the table.  My fiance ordered the Beef Stroganoff.  The beef was dry and chewy, the stroganoff sauce seemed lacking in flavor.  The dish seemed kind of watery.  The service was nice, the place was packed.  The restaurant had a nice vibe, but the menu offerings were disjointed, and the vinyl tablecloths were awkward.  I think the restaurant would do well to simplify the menu, and focus a bit more on quality.",

If you only have 1hr for lunch... maybe not if you are rushing, but definitely come for dinner or drinks after work.    There's a really cool \"neighborhood\" feel to this place and everyone is in close quarters, but that's part of the charm of this place.

We were shown to a \"half booth\" in the back with the option to wait for a real table, but we found it quite cozy.   We began with the nachos which were delicious. The soft chips are a nice spin on classic nachos. I had the \"What it is\" which is said to be a favorite on the menu. It is basically a Cajun chicken pasta. It was very good, a tad salty but good. My guest ordered the honey chicken pasta with the tomato bacon sauce which she enjoyed. The helpings were very generous.   Our service was great the whole time we were there. We were in a back corner on a busy night and we never went long with something we needed. We thought the prices were quite fair for the food.   I loved the neighborhood feel of the place, it reminded me of a big city back street restaurant. I would definitely go back.",

While my best friend and his boyfriend were in town for the holidays, we decided to stop in here for a bite to eat.  It was after 1 PM & surprisingly, the place was still packed.  This isn't saying much, because the tavern is quite small. Luckily, there were some empty seats at the bar.  They have a pretty extensive lunch menu & everything sounds good! I had a hard time choosing, but I went with the burger & cajun fries. (My second choice was the grilled cheese - maybe next time!)  We didn't wait too long until our food arrived. Holy cow (pun intended), this burger was HUGE! There were plenty of fries, too!  The burger was so tasty. It was just the right amount of juicy, without said juicy running down your wrists & arms. The bun from local Nova's Bakery was a fantastic addition. Word of caution: you will have to cut this burger in half!  Needless to say I finished my entire burger...it was only right! I wasn't able to finish the fries, but they were hot & crispy & the cajun seasoning had just enough \"bite\"...it wasn't overpowering.  The staff was so friendly & chatted frequently with us. They always made sure our glasses were filled & that we were enjoying our food.   The prices are a bit pricey, but in my case, the portion equaled the price ($9).  I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Wow. Using the overused term \"hidden gem\" really doesn't do Alexander Michael's proper justice. This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn't notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior.   HINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets.   Sat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong.   Service is so friendly here. You really get the feeling that these people have been at it for a long time and keep it old school.   If you haven't been or are on the fence, I highly recommend. Definitely one of the Uptown staples.",

    "text": "I have to laugh b/c this is the second time I find myself quoting Nicole W. but she said it best \"Alexander Michael's is the quintessential go-to spot for solid food, good drinks and superb company all packaged into a quaint little spot in the 4th ward.\"  Especially if you live within walking distance, this is a place you will go again and again for an uncomplicated place to find simple food done right with quality beer selections.  I had the chicken pita.  I was not expecting that the chicken would be perfectly cooked, seasoned and the pita warm and robust.  A side of beans satisfied an additional protein craving without the temptation of the go-to french fries.  The place is too cute explaining on the back of the menu why there is a beam in the ladies room which finds itself the victim of unsuspecting visitors who inevitably find themselves in close contact with the supporting structure.  They also give some history on the house which makes good reading while you wait for your first round to show up.    Small complaint that again, tv in the dining area.  I guess many people eat in front of the television at home and grow accustom to it?  Also, low ceilings make for a cozy atmosphere.  Probably not the #1 place for enjoying the natural sunlight of a gorgeous day.",

It is tcuked away in a neighborhood right in downtown.  I hear this place is a establishment in Charlotte and has been around for a long time.  I now know why..  the food is fantastic! The fried pickles are a must a littel salty but good.  I had the Fried Chicken Special with Garlic mash with Gravy and it was GOOOOOOOODD!!!  My friend had the London Broil and looked amazing and the prices were so reasonable.  I highly recommend this place its a chance to see a good ol local hangout in the city of Charlotte.",

    "text": "I used Yelp for the first time after a friend of mine informed me of it's awesomeness.  I was looking for a fun night out with my husband and I came across Alexander Michael's, just by chance.  We live on in South Meck county and don't get to explore the depths of urban Charlotte very often so a field-trip was in order.   I'll start off by saying parking is awful!  If you do not live in the neighborhood and are planning to walk, be prepared.  Most of the parking is by residential-permit only.  We drove around for a good 20 minutes before finding a lot across from the Harris Teeter on W 6th street that was open to the public.   LOVED Alexander Michael's!  Loved it!  It's a warm, inviting oasis in the middle of the city.  I am an urban-girl by heart, begrudgingly living in the burbs, and this just reassured me that I will be back in the city as soon as the kids are grown and gone.  My husband ordered us each a drink, (extensive beer list!) we gave our name to the host and hung out near the bar while we waited for our table.  Although the house was packed, tables were turning quickly.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table.   The staff is very fair about seating.  First-come, first-sat, kind of thing, regardless of your party size.  I would think you are taking your chances with the seating if you have a party any larger than 8 though because it's not a very big place.   We started out with the fried pickles.  A bit too salty but that didn't stop me from eating half of the basket.   The owner (I assumed it was the owner; a middle aged guy, very interested in what we thought of the place and very intimate with the menu) came by and chatted with us.  I asked what the house specialty was.  He was not specific about any dish but instead told me what the best sellers were.  I opted for the London broil sandwich and onion rings.  (A best seller)  Someone near us had just ordered it and it looked delicious.  My husband also ordered the London Broil sandwich.  (He does this often and it drives me crazy!)  But he asked for the broccoli slaw.  (Broccoli slaw was a bit bland but the onion rings were great!  The sandwich was pretty good too.) The staff was in no hurry and that was perfect.  We were not in a hurry.  Our meals came and I talked over and over again about how much I loved this place.  It wasn't the food so much as the atmosphere.  It was neighborhoody and warm.  The staff was incredibly nice and patient and we enjoyed ourselves and our urban experience.   I will go back again and I have no doubt it will, again, be an awesome experience.  Thank you Yelp for leading me here!",

    "text": "Shh. The first rule of Alexander Michael's is: you do not talk about Alexander Michael's. The second rule of Alexander Michael's is: you DO NOT talk about Alexander Michael's. The third rule is to not run into the pole in the woman's bathroom and don't go upstairs because it's haunted. But that's for another review.  You would miss this place if you were strolling through 4th ward looking at the houses, because it fits right in. Located in an older house, the ambiance is casual but dark. Food style: It's an amalgamation of Cajun and American, nothing too off the wall. But it's all delicious.  The Lady and I went here on a double date, where the other couple did everything in their power not to order the What it Is, partially because they both knew they needed to branch out. So we started off with an order of fried pickles and I ordered the What it Is, you know, so they could still look at it (I'm SUCH a nice guy!!).   The fried pickles were great, as was the dipping sauce. The main dish came out, and holy cow it looks great. Everyone's looks great. And it tastes the same as it looks. Oh man, that cajun sauce and perfectly blackened chicken...*shudder*. I had to really force myself not to finish the whole thing so I could save some for leftovers.  The price point was a little bit higher than an average night out (you're looking at ~$18 for an entree, you could absolutely order other things though and still have a full meal for cheaper!), but it was well worth it. I can't wait to come back here and try out more, this seems like a really special place. I don't think I'll ever get on the 'regular' status, but Alexander Michael's seems to have a lot of those, and honestly, you're treated like one either way.",

I've had the chance to have several menu items here, each being just as good as the last.   -The London Broil is served with perfectly  cooked/marinated flank stead. Of course to have to get it with the peppers & onions to really make it what it should be.  -The Ruben is a good size, and the Dijon mustard they thrown on there makes it a little different than what you're used to. It surprised me as I didn't even read the description on the menu when I ordered it.  -the quinoa veggie black bean burger is superb. This is a must try for everyone who loves any sort of veggie burgers --- it's served on fresh pita bread, wowza! -crab soup is delicious as a starter for all you seafood lovers out there.   Bonus: All of their bread is locally sourced from the outstanding Nova's Bakery in Plaza Midwood!",

It was overpriced bar food to me. Beer selection wasn't anything magical and I got beef tips and a baked potato and it wasn't any better than any chilis, outback (insert standard chain). Not saying I won't be back because their location is great but not my absolute favorite",

It feels a little like a pub, cozy but still very family friendly.  There is a nice bar plus tables and booths for a choice of seating.  It's fun, it doesn't get super loud and you can still hear and talk easily with each other at the table, which is part of the attraction too.    As for the food - everything we've tried has been to die for.  Last week we all ordered something different for tasting - Burgers, chicken, tuna plate with their special broccoli slaw, and the spicy crab soup!!!  Only shared a tiny bit of my soup, but it was enough for the taster to decide to order his own lol.  Have always loved Charleston she crab soup, but have come to love AM's even more.  Service is spot on - the local community is beautiful and great for a walk after your meal.  Definitely a place to put on your list if ever in the area.",

We grabbed the last available table and had great service. There were several couples out for a date night and groups of friends. Great, cozy vibe.   Good beer selection. We were feeling like splitting a couple apps instead of ordering meals. Wings were good but nothing special. I liked the black bean hummus. Nachos were great. Flour chips instead of corn-- which by boyfriend really loved. Lots of toppings!   So many of their entrees and pasta dishes looked good, can't wait to go back and try one!",

Service is always consistent, too.  Nothing fancy - but that's perfect for me.  Go for the London Broil sammy at lunch.  Reasonably priced and delicious.  If I had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant, I'd focus on parking and adding more tables.  Street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited.  I've been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table.  Both faults, however, are incredibly hard to control.",

    "text": "My partner took me to Alexander Michael's last night for dinner.  When he lived in Uptown, he used to frequent the restaurant often, but it was my first time.  You could say I got my cherry popped.  Alexander Michael's is tucked away from the Uptown skyscrapers in the residential section.  You probably wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there.  It looks like it could be just another house on the quiet street.  There are no big signs for it and not a lot of discernable noise from the outside.    Once we got inside, though, we saw that it was quite packed.  We were lucky to get seated right away in the crowded room that resembled something of an English or Irish pub.  The lighting was low and the casually dressed crowd was \"older\" than a lot of Uptown bars, so we felt like we fit in with the 30- and 40-somethings.   We started with a Woodchuck Cider (not everyone carries ciders!) and it was sweet, bubbly, and refreshing.  We enjoyed that our server wasn't overly attentive, but she was there whenever we needed to order and checked up on us only when necessary.  I tried the blackened catfish and my partner had the honey chicken.  Both were delicious.  Mine (accompanied by spicy black beans) had just the right amount of cajun flavor.  And the portion sizes were just right -- not enough to overfill you, but not enough to leave you hungry when you left.    It was definitely an enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning to this new (to me).  The only disappoint is that we weren't able to see the famous pole that they talked about on the back of the menu.  It's located in the women's restroom and apparently it's caused quite a few bruises.  Funny!",

The places looks like it only fits about 75 people max.   Waiting for a table we sat at the bar and I noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and I'm not talking Anhueser Busch B.S. Lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews. I tried a few high ABV brews that were really good and put my head in another world. I had been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really liking Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called \"What It Is\". it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I usually only do at home. I was thoroughly impressed.",

Maybe ABs gets flustered when they try to put on their fancy-pants for Restaurant Week.  Yeah, it's a little faux-pub, a little fratty, but there are only two TVs (god, my standards are dropping) and the food is cheap. What did I get? The nachos. What will I probably get every time I come? Said nachos. No art, no pretention - fried flour tortillas dusted with something aromatic and carefully smothered with black beans, cheese, tomatoes, and (tehehe) lettuce shreds we'll just go ahead and call chiffonade. Simple, textural, good. For 7 bucks. Jalapenos needed, my spicy friends, so ask. The size of your head, this pile, no, torso.  It's 1994 up in this joint, and they don't give a damn - but it limits the veg selections. I can respect the beer list, and the service was quietly good. Darkish lighting. I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach underneath the 5 pounds of nacho that the place swims in RL polos and Sperrys on the wkends (and this is before I perused other yelper's thoughts on the subject) but for Monday night nosh, it competently hit the spot.",

Upon entering this pub-like restaurant/bar we were seated and greeted promptly.   I ordered a cider on tap (a favorite of mine), a side salad, and the \"What it is\" . The star oddly enough was the salad, she said all their dressings were homemade and it certainly tasted that way.  The \"What it is\" was just ok in my opinion. I have had my share of amazing pasta dishes but never have been much of a rotini fan. The dish has a lot of dried herbs and I just prefer fresh...the chicken seemed almost too rubbed in cajun spice for my taste. That being said, I would like to give it another shot and order something else besides pasta ..I really am a tough critic in the Italian department.   My biggest gripe of the night was the pace of service. I don't know if the server (or chef) had somewhere to be but she was going a mile a minute. I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal not be rushed in and out in less than 45minutes. My dinner came as half of my salad remained uneaten...and the salad was literally brought out in less than a minute after I ordered it. I realize its a small venue with limited seating but there wasn't anyone waiting for a table and last  I checked this was not at a fast food joint.",

This is one of those places that you'd never find unless one, you find it on the infamous Yelp!, or two, someone took you here because they knew about it --mine was the latter.  The location is buried in a residential area of uptown Charlotte right off the beaten track --which really gives it a unique feel.  The insides kind of had the feeling of a snug, English style pub.  It was quite small and the tables were pushed relatively close together.  Its overall appearance was pretty clean despite its dark look and feel.  The food was pretty good.  I got their club sandwich with fries and my kids got the grilled cheese --which looked and tasted great!  The club sandwich was alright, using just regular deli meat and cheese on thick toasted bread.  The staff at this place were great.  They were very friendly and polite and pretty efficient, too.  The only downside to this place was I thought it was pretty expensive for what you got.",

Tucked away in 4th ward you may unfortunately overlook this hidden gem. It is a historic home turned into a lovely and quaint restaurant. The ambiance is something you will not find in other uptown Charlotte restaurants. The food has always been top notch, along with the service. I've dined (and drank at the bar) many times and everytime I leave I know it won't be long before I'll be back :) On a side note...definitely try the \"what it is\" pasta dish!

The decor is a mix between old school pub and cozy restaurant.  I've been here several times and seem to always get a salad because they normally do their salads with a spinach leaf base, throw in some pasta for good measure and top it off with fantastic grilled chicken.    It's a little off the beaten path which can be a breath of fresh air from the places to eat lunch or dinner down Tryon Street.  It looks to be built from one of the renovated homes there in the neighborhood with a 'dollhouse' style exterior in my opinion.  Cool character for a restaurant.  One thing to note is that it's a bit dark in there because there isn't any overhead lighting or if there is, it's very minimal.  So if you sit back towards the back prepare to eat by candlelight (even at lunch).  The only windows are towards the front so that's why.",

I appreciate that there is very little architectural history left in Charlotte, and that this is a piece of architectural history. I appreciate that the food here is good and that we tried some regional food, like fried pickles. I am not a fan of noisy, small places though, and that's what killed it for me. The hostess was great, but the female server bordered on rude. (It May be a survival tactic.) One man in particular was hitting against my seat because he couldn't get a seat in the bar. The place should not be set up like this where situations like this are inevitable. The low vibration side of me would like to advise him to wait until a bar seat is available before choosing to stand, crowd me, and lessen my experience. I will just end with if you are seeking a special place to celebrate a momentous occasion, avoid this place. As a historical site this place is  fine.",

And to think, they had proposed a nearby pub.  We went around 8:00 on a Thursday and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but the time flew by as we had some beers at the bar. We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant, which, with the candlelit tables, felt very intimate.  This was my second time here. I really enjoyed the Feta Chicken last time, and this time I went with the What It Is (blackened chicken breast over fresh rotini in a Cajun cream sauce). It was amazing! The portion was generous and it was just the right amount of spicy. I reluctantly shared some with my parents and they agreed it was heavenly.  This place is perfect for everyone. I was there with my parents and I noticed tables of guy friends, girl friends, and plenty of people on dates. No reason not to check this place out, especially if you live in 4th Ward.",

    "text": "What a hidden gem! I have been here twice now and I can't wait to return again.  This is a small house converted into a restaurant. I did not notice a hostess stand upon arriving, but each time a man has always been quick to come over to get our name. We've had to wait each time almost 30 minutes (party of 2 then 5), but it was the weekend and it is on the smaller side. So, it's to be expected and totally worth it.  There is a large bar to grab a drink or an appetizer.    OK, now for the food. House nachos! Or I would say fancy nachos. Pictures this, flour tortilla wedges covered in cheese, black beans, black olives and tomatoes. I've had them both times and I love them so. Plus, it's huge!  For my entree, I've had the Honey Chicken pasta and Feta Chicken Pasta. The Feta chicken pasta is full of veggies (peppers, broccoli and onions) and it's light. It's tossed in a garlic herb sauce and served over penne pasta. I really liked the flavor!  Alexander Micheal's is that cute, casual, grab dinner with the girls or date night spot!",

It was pretty empty, which I welcomed, since it's such a small place and I've heard wait times can be long! It's even smaller and darker than I imagined. I appreciate it for what it is - a great, historic neighborhood pub and restaurant. That being said, I don't think the food is anything too exceptional, but it is good for pub-like food - my 4 stars mostly goes to the atmosphere and experience.   They have a selection of local beers on tap- there were options from Noda, Sycamore, Triple C, wooden robot and Sugar Creek. Around $5-$6 per pint. We split the jerk chicken quesadillas and the London Broil sandwich, after reading rave reviews. Both were tasty. Definitely add the onions, mushrooms and peppers on the London Broil- otherwise you're doing it wrong. Because it comes coated with a melty Swiss cheese and you want all the substance you can get. Also, get the Cajun fries.   Oh, and watch out for the pole in the ladies bathroom!",

We actually started a conversation with a girl sitting at the bar that ended up joining us for dinner.   We were there on a Monday night and the special was meatloaf. I'm not overly fond of meatloaf, and would usually not order it in a restaurant, but for whatever reason decided to go for it. I'm glad I did as it was amazing.   I had a slice of carrot cake for desert that was also very good. All in all, it was a great meal with friends. It's worth mentioning again how friendly and helpful the staff was, which genuinely helps to make the Alexander Michael's experience. Al Mike's is what a neighborhood pub should be.",

The menu is fairly small but has a little bit of everything: classic bar appetizers, pasta dishes, burgers and sandwiches. They also have a decent selection of local beers on draft.  I usually always get one of the pasta dishes like the honey chicken or the what it is. Last night I opted for the penne Athena and it was delicious! The cream sauce was flavorful but still very light and the veggies were fresh and delicious. As a starter I highly recommend the crab soup- it's so good, I could honestly make a meal out of just that!  Another thing I really love about Al Mike's is that all of their chicken is natural and raised without antibiotics which is a surprising touch for a tavern-style restaurant, but it is very much appreciated!",

This is a great date spot because of the ambiance and energy (also you can stroll through the nearby park after dinner). I feel like there are two groups of people - those who don't know about Al Mikes and those who love it (and hope the others don't ever try it so that the wait times don't get too outrageous). I am in the group that love it!  First of all, every employee is welcoming and friendly. The owner/manager (I'm not sure) clearly loves the place and the people. He is the host, he brings out the food, he buses tables, he checks in with guests, etc. I love the way he takes pride in making sure every customer has a great experience. I consistently get the \"What It Is\". The flavor is great and the portion size always allows for sharing and having leftovers the next day. My boyfriend samples different things on the menu but loves the beef stroganoff. He tried the london broil (kinda dry) and the wings (could've been a little more crispy) but says the beef stroganoff is the best thing he has tried. Friends say their veggie burger is awesome, but I haven't tried it.   Parking can be tricky but we don't mind walking a little bit if needed, so it isn't a problem. There is usually a wait but it's worth it. Overall this is a great spot.",

I loved it!  As for the food, I ordered the Cajun catfish sandwich and a cup of soup. The sandwich came with a remoulade which was good, but also with a tangy pickle jammy type sauce that I thought really pulled the dish together. I had a cup of crab soup as well- it was rich and hearty.   I left here satisfied, and was impressed even more by the value. I'll definitely be back!",

It's tucked back in 4th ward and appears to fit right within the neighborhood- it looks like a quaint house from the outside. And from what I've heard, it use to be an old grocery store! The decor is old school- wood paneling, throwback signs, but the food is delicious!   IMO, AL's has one of the best veggie burgers in Charlotte! This is a must try item, even if you're a meat lover. The veggie burger isn't served on a bun, but rather than pita bread. It's a quinoa bean burger and it's just fricken delicious, especially because it's topped with avocado!     Another must try are their fried pickles with ranch. I mean is there anything to question with this recommendation? NO. Order them- love them- and come back again!",

    "text": "Al Mike's gets 5 stars because the atmosphere and ambiance are so uncommonly wonderful. From the beautiful wooden ceiling to the lovingly salvaged bar, to the incredibly awesome beer fridge, everything inside says \"Welcome. Stay awhile.\"  second Ace: a lovingly selected beer list. Small, but thoughtful, this one had a few surprises even for me! There's big names like Duvel and Sierra Nevada, local beers from Asheville, Mooresville, and Charlotte, and even a few Germans you might not expect - Neumarkt and Moos are usually not beer producing cities you see in the US. Well, not Chicago anyway.  third ace: the food. Since the restaurant industry is label-obsessed, I'll make one up: upgraded comfort pub grub. Could a few of the ingredients benefit from the upgrade? Sure. But this is not a \"blow your mind with something new\" kind of place. It is a \"let you know that everything is right with the world by doing the simple things well\" kind of place. For example: The meatloaf is tender and meaty. The Reuben -- a sandwich invented at the Blackstone Hotel in Omaha, NE, yeah, that's right NYC, take your 'We invented everything' God complex and stuff it! -- is solid with rye bread that leaves seeds in your teeth, an unabashed amount of salty sauerkraut, and just enough 1000 Island to moisten the affair.  Fourth ace: Did I mention the beer fridge? It's just awesome.  Now, I may not be a big city poker ace, but I do believe four aces is a mighty tough hand to beat.  Checkmate!",

We were \"tipped off\" by a fellow Charlottinian about Alexander Michael's, and were intrigued by the directions he gave us to get there. \"You're not far from it. Off the beaten path. Shortcut through the shrubs.\" I already liked it.   Once we found the shortcut, we immediately smelled the food and followed our noses. It is tucked away in a residential area and if the food didn't smell so good you might walk right by it. We sat at the bar and needed to pull the candle closer in order to read the menu. If you take anything from this review let it be this: Honey. Garlic. BBQ Wings. YUM.  I ordered the veggie burger as my main and was expecting nothing exciting, since most restaurants serve the usual warm-on-the-outside-cold-in-the-middle-sad-excuse-for-a-meal hockey puck. I was surprised that it was not only excellent and flavorful, but clearly home made. They had a great selection of micro-brewed beers in addition to the usual suspects, so my fiancee was happy from the moment we sat down. Laid back, fun and low-key, we definitely found our go-to joint. Oh, and ladies, watch out for the pole in the bathroom. You'll thank me later.",

    "text": "Al Mike's, as it is locally known, is housed in a 1890's Victorian era building that housed the E.W. Berryhill Store for 70 years. During the 60's & 70's, the building housed multiple businesses, from a paint store, a thrift store, grocery store and delicatessen. In 1983, Michael Alexanders neighborhood tavern opened for business.   A popular neighborhood institution, Al Mike's retains some interesting building characteristics, such as the supporting pole almost directly in front of the women's restroom door, which lends itself to many a bumped head as well as built in coolers that are original turn of the century ice box coolers.   We dined on the Spicy Crab Soup, which one of my dining partners characterized as melted Velveeta with crab and while that description might sound rather unappealing, it was quite yummy. In addition to the three cheese on Texas Toast sandwich, which was ok, but a bit on the dry side, my other dining companions had other basics, such as sandwiches and burgers. This is tavern food, so don't go expecting high end meals. The appeal of this restaurant, as a visitor to Charlotte, is that it is located in the Fourth Ward, a small district of brick and Victorian buildings and the unique history of the building that houses Al Mike's.",

    "text": "Wow, what a pleasant surprise!  I never would have known about Al Mike's (as it is known casually) without reading the reviews on Yelp.  Most people said very positive things, so we decided to go here for my birthday dinner.  There were 5 of us, and then 7 on a Saturday night.  Granted the weather was terrible, but we were easily seated at a comfortable table in the middle of the restaurant.  The waitress put up with our indecisiveness with grace and humor, and answered all of our questions very nicely.  Our group started with the Fried Pickles, and even with that many people one order was enough.  Of course, if you know Fried Pickles you know that too much is not a good thing.  These were light and not greasy, even though they came out to us super-hot and fresh out of the fryer.  Their ranch dressing was wonderful, and really complimented the sharp dill taste of the pickles.  Our entrees arrived very quickly, and our table ordered everything from one of the specials, to pasta, to a burrito.  All reports back on entrees were positive.  We had a vegetarian in the group and he was easily acommodated by their menu.  My Feta Chicken dish was chicken (duh) served over penne pasta with lots of veggies and covered in feta cheese.  The taste of the dish was great, and my only complaints had to do with texture.  The sauce was more of a broth, which is how it was described in the menu, but I guess I was expecting a bit more structure to it.  And, the chicken was tough.  Flavorful, but tough.  The rest of the dish was great.  The feta was lively, and there were some wonderful mushrooms in the sauce that were a treat to discover every few forkfuls.  Because it was my birthday, I got a free chocolate brownie!  It came out with a little candle in it, which was very sweet.  Our group also ordered the bread pudding.  Between the two desserts, I think the bread pudding might be the superb choice even though I'm a chocolate girl through and through.  It had a complex flavor that was just delightful.  The brownie was good, as really all brownies are.  I prefer wine, and while the wine list is not extensive here I was perfectly happy with the pinot noir on the menu.  If you are a beer drinker, than this place has a ton of options for you!  The rest of my group drank beer, and heartily enjoyed it.  I am so glad to have found Al Mike's, and I strongly recommend that you make the effort to find it in the 4th Ward.  It's easiest to get to off Graham Street - just turn south onto 9th and it's a block or so up the road.  Loved it!!!",

Dark, cozy--just a really cool spot. Not far from uptown, but in a more residentially area than you'd expect. It even kinda looks like a house from the road.   Great bar scene if you're looking to meet up for a few drinks (definitely not the type of place to really meet people or get sloppy, if that's what you're looking to do), with really cool, knowledgeable bartenders.   Good food, too. Last time in, I had the wings (definitely above average) and a pulled-pork sandwich, which was great. Simple, American-style food but done well, with great ingredients.   Definitely a great date place. Cool vibe and classy in an understated way--check it out!",

    "text": "We really liked the pub feel of this place and the location hidden among the houses. It could be easy to miss if you didn't know it was there. The inside didn't feel like a house at all, it was pretty dark inside, yet light enough to read the menu and socialize. The service was great, prompt refills, although we did wait an extended period of time to get our check.  i had the buffalo chicken sandwich and Cajun fries. Wasn't a big fan of the buffalo chicken. i guess i prefer more sauce and flavor. It seemed like too much chicken and bun, with not enough flavor. i liked the Cajun fries for my side and they were a generously sized portion.  We also tried the nachos. My special lady friend gave them a thumbs up. They were flour tortilla chips which seemed odd at first, but in the end seemed like a good choice.   i'd like to go back another time when i can enjoy some drinks and try another menu selection.",

Not only did I enjoy it, but the other 5 members of my group did as well, noting the wonderful food, as well as the ambience (such as the odd pole in the women's restroom) as their own special highlight.  The waitress was wonderfully friendly and helpful (because this was a business trip, we had to expense with separate checks) and the owner even consented to spinning some of the yarns about the stories behind the \"haunted house\" rumors.  He even volunteered to snap our photo as we left the restaurant.    As for my meal, I got \"What it is\", blackened chicken over pasta, which was extremely tender and welcome after a weekend of too much roast pork the previous weekend in Charlotte.  I even saved room for the bread pudding for desert, and was not disappointed.  You won't find Al Mike's in any of the Charlotte's guidebooks, but it's worth the search, worth the look, worth the trip, and worth your business.  I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Bored at night at the Double Tree near the bus station in Charlotte I needed a better place to hang out.  Tired of hotel bars and expensive consultant watering pools I found myself looking for a out of the way neighborhood bar.  Enter a young woman I met on a flight from BWI to CLT.  She told me about a cool neighborhood bar with 10 minutes of the hotel.  I sat on this information for  two weeks until last evening when I gave in and took a walk.   Located in some cool neighborhood that I have no idea where in Charlotte is a really great bar with a very laid back atmosphere and genuine customers.    You enter the establishment and it takes you back to those old European bars in Amsterdam.  Dark, unassuming and quaint.  Service was top notch, and the food was excellent.  I have the Vegetarian Burger on Texas Toast with onions and tomato.  Pretty good in my book.  Done just right.  I topped it off with 2 Amstel Lights and some good conversation.    I need to find more places like this.  The great thing about A.M is it is not that easy to find.  And in this busy world we all live in t A.M is the place I want to be.  Thanks Airtran girl, much appreicated!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.almikes.net&s=fcc5fef8c4e2ca802bbd97d4cb1ff879700afa94640382cc9ccfd821d6c1a00a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">almikes.net</a>",

If you aren't looking for it you might miss it.  It can get busy, but the staff is super friendly and fast. You won't have to wait that long for a table. One of my favorite things about this place is their fried pickles. Now, if you live in Charlotte you might try to tell me that the Penguin has the best fried pickles. I would politely agree to disagree (well maybe not that politely, I am a little obsessive about food). Because these fried pickles are the perfect combo of grease and crunch. How I miss them .   Another gem about this place is it's history, It is in an old Victorian house that I think used to be a mercantile. The decor is dark, and inviting. There is a booth in the back with a bench that just sits two. Perfect for a romantic rendezvous.   Not too shabby of a  beer selection either.",

Tucked in a nook of the 4th ward, Alexander Michael's adds a welcoming place to meet some friends, in an already welcoming neighborhood.  Great taverns always have a few things in common:  They feel sturdy, heavy and warm.  There is always a boisterous excitement that still allows for secluded conversation, while beaming with cheer and brotherhood.  The food though, just not that great.

Creamy, cheesy, and spicy, and topped with juicy blackened chicken breast. It always seems like they are down a server or two, so it can sometimes be hard to flag someone down, but the waitresses working have always been friendly and the kitchen is usually fast once the order is in. The decor looks like it hasn't been changed in 30 years, which fits well with its function as a neighborhood watering hole.   I usually walk here from Uptown after work, but parking is somewhat limited if you choose to drive. There is a small lot about half a block away, as well street parking.  Also, get the bread pudding for desert -- it comes out piping hot, moist, and is drenched in a delicious caramel sauce.",

This was probably the fifth or sixth time I have eaten at this local neighborhood gem, and I can assuredly tell you, this Alexander Michael's experience was just as good as the first.  My date and I walked in pleasantly surprised that despite the warm, quiet, lazy, summer evening outside, Alexander Michael's was cool, dark, and very lively on the inside.  We were directly escorted to a table in the cozy restaurant, just behind the bar.    My date ordered the chicken pita with fries (I've taken a picture of it), I ordered the craw fish bake (see pic).  The bake was a cross between a shrimp pasta and a seafood casserole.  It was perfectly gooey and cheesy - but not heartstoppingly so.  As for my date's pita; she loved it.  I had a few bites and can attest to its legitimacy.  Both OUR MEALS WERE EXCELLENT!!    I am truly of fan of this elegant and intimate Charlotte jewel. To me, Alexander Michael's is a place where you can get elegant, all-american bar food, but with an upscale twist.  If you haven't been to Alexander Michael's - GO!  If you've already been, GO AGAIN!!",

Was immediately greeted by Cooper, the host and owner's son. And yes ladies he is a \"hunk.\" And a hell of a nice guy too! I shared some of the other female Yelp reviews with him and he laughed.  Due to the other Yelp reviews I started with the fried pickles. Theirs were very lightly battered so you can actually TASTE the pickles! I thought that was great, along with the standard Ranch dipping sauce.  Cooper recommended the Penne Athena which was a nice, light chicken dish with black olives, red peppers and a light mushroom cream sauce. Very tasty and indeed not too heavy following my walkibg tour.   Overall very good! Cooper, Milt at the bar were super gracious and friendly hosts! Can't wait to come back to try their 4th Ward Stroganoff.",

It's definitely a gem in 4th Ward and worth stopping in if you're in the area.  My latest stop into Alexander Michael's was to continue my quest around Charlotte to find the best reuben in the city. The classic sandwich didn't disappoint. The corned beef was OK, a little above average, and the kraut was your standard store-bought style. It was loaded up with flavorful cheese and russian, adding an unhealthy but delicious flavor. Where the reuben really stood out though was the bread - it was full of that great rye flavor you're looking for and crisped up perfectly. Additionaly, the ingredients were proportioned perfectly - something I've rarely found on my journey. When it all came together it was one of the better reubens I've tried of the approximately 30 so far. It's definitely a place I plan to head back to so I can enjoy another delicious reuben from this great establishment.",

I really came for the spicy crab soup which was disappointing in my opinion. Most of the ingredients were great, except the imitation crab (the disappointing part) I picked through it and ate everything else. My friend tasted and confirmed that it was imitation crab. You can taste the sweet flavor---ugh! Now if this was real crab! Ohhhh buddy!! The flavor would've been amazing!! I didn't feel like sending the food back, I wasn't interested in trying anything else. So please excuse my diverse pallet.   Was the service great? Yes! Our waiter was very nice.

The waitress actually forgot and remembered right when she gave it to me (not a big deal), but she insisted on taking it back and fixing it.

It wasn't even good reheated the next day because the oil had separated. I still really like the food here. We've had wings and the hummus as appetizers, both are good. My boyfriend had a sundried tomato and basil pasta which was very good. Reasonably priced but the service is just kind of..eh. They're not very personable, no introductions, just kind of auto pilot. Our server was cut, and instead of introducing the next server, she just never said another word to us, and the next one never introduced herself either. I enjoy the romantic intimate vibe, and we will probably be back. I recommend it to several people for the food and atmosphere, but always warn not to expect anything special from the servers.",

Alexander Michael's is a nice little bar/ restaurant located at the outskirt of Fourth Ward Uptown in the middle of a residential neighborhood. The set up was classy, and to my amusement I ended up having a candle-lit lunch with my macho coworker  For lunch we both ordered a Reuben sandwich with cajun seasoned fries. The sandwiches were relatively smaller than other restaurants, but they were steaming hot with dijon mustard and were absolutely delicious! As for the fries, you can smell the cajun seasoning from far away which is absolutely mouth watering!  I for sure will be back again!",

I have not yet tried the London Broil, which I've heard is one of their more popular dishes, but I have had the She-Crab soup and it is very delicious!   The staff is always very friendly and I love the older wooden benches (They are similar to those of 300 East.) At night, candles are lit and it feels very comfy and cozy inside. I think this would be a good place for a first date but the menu isn't terribly extensive or expensive (if that's what you're going for on a first date...) You can order entrees, as well as salads or appetizers like quesadillas. The bar has a nice beer selection as well. It is located in the heart of 4th ward, snuggled between houses and cobble stone streets, which can make it a little difficult to find but perfect if you live in uptown and can walk to the restaurant while taking in the beautiful houses and scenery along the way.  Full Disclosure: Ladies... if you want the REAL reason to visit Alexander Michaels, here it is.. COOPER. He is one hell of a handsome man that works here. I have seen him a few times while visiting here and he has been extremely helpful and charming each time. I sat at a table facing the door last time I was here and watched every single woman, young and old, swoon over Cooper as he greeted them at the door with a huge, bright smile. I am normally not impressed by the looks of most men but Good Lord help me if he is single. I don't think I could handle it.   I also hope Cooper does not frequent <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a>...  ;)",

But it's nice to see history preserved in this area of town.  It's like stepping back into the turn of the century.  Anyway, about Alex Mike's.  The building used to be an old grocery store, now it's a neighborhood pub.  The staff is supper friendly and accommodating.    The restaurant itself is dark and intimate with wood everywhere, candles on the tables and soft lighting throughout.   Tables are close but you don't feel that you are sitting on top of the next table.  The menu is short but has a several appetizing selections from pasta dishes to sandwiches.  We got there and spent 45 minutes just in conversation and drinking before ordering our meals.  The meal came out within 15 minutes.     I had the feta chicken which was wonderful - savory chicken on top of a bed of penne pasta with veggies and feta.  The fried pickles appetizer was good as well.  Others in my group tried the sandwiches which were good as well.  I can only hope that Alex Mike's stays open in Charlotte for another 28+ years.",

    "text": "On a Thursday evening recently, passing through Charlotte, NC, I checked out Yelp and chose Alexander Michael's from the choices available. It was better even than all the positive reviews had led me to expect. And the largely local clientele bore this out.  A local \"gem\" in the shadows of Charlotte's downtown high-rises--in the city's 4th Ward--this saloon has quite a variety of beers on tap to complement their delicious food. I had a Babymaker 2x IPA to wash down my extraordinary \"4th Ward Beef Stroganoff\" on rigatoni.   The restaurant was crowded and busy but I was greeted as I walked in the door and assured of a table soon, even though I was alone. In fact, the owner noticed that I had parked my car in a no-parking spot, walked out with me, and visually found me a safe place to put my car. When I told him how I came, he said he'd show me a quicker way back to my motel after I'd eaten. An hour later, he kept that promise, seeking me out despite the lingering crowd.  But more amazingly, when I got back to my room I check my email and found a message on LinkedIn, from HIM--informing me that I'd left my credit card behind at the table. How had he found me on LinkedIn? His effort was astonishing.   Excellent and varied food, good drink, attentive and helpful wait people, and a cheerful crowd combine to make a visit to Alexander MIchael's a special night out and a haven for the traveler at the end of a day on the road. And a memory to renew when visiting Charlotte again.",

The menu has an array of pasta's and hearty meat dishes. Good selection of local beers as well. ONLY reason This review isn't accompanied by 5 stars is the parking situation outside, which is pretty rough but that can be said about any location in Uptown. Will definitely be back!",

I've been here one other time on a Friday or Saturday and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table of 2.  The service was good and pretty quick for how busy they were.  We tried the Ruben and it was one of the better Rubens we have had.  The sides were a little better than average, but the broccoli slaw was outstanding.  We also had the London broil, better than average but just a little tough.  The jerk chicken quesadilla was amazing and we would definitely get it again.  We will come back here for sure, for the food, the good beer selection, and the chill atmosphere.  A great place.  Would have given five stars had the menu been a little bigger offering more variety.",

Of course, I had to look up the reviews on Yelp before I agreed, and once I did, I was sold.    And now that I've been, I must say, Charlotte Yelpers, you are right on with this one!  I love this incredibly charming historic restaurant and the 4th Ward neighborhood that surrounds it.  AM's atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Luckily, we arrived early on Saturday night (around 6:30), so we didn't have to wait for a table... (The restaurant did, however, fill up within a half hour).  The highlights in my eyes: *great beer selection! *fried pickles!  *burger *onion rings  It was my first time ever trying fried pickles, and I'm a fan!  We devoured them as an appetizer for the table.    We weren't huge fans of the crab soup, and I'd stay away from salads... they are nothing special.  The service was attentive with a snap of attitude.  I think they probably are friendlier toward their regulars, but that's fine by me.  If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular too!",

The server brought each plate individually when I finished the previous, as if it was a 3-course dinner.  The owner referred to me by my first name every time he spoke to me and made me really feel welcome. I'm not local, but wish I had the opportunity to try every thing else on the menu. I doubt I would ever be disappointed. If I get the opportunity, I'll be sure to return.",

Tucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.    I was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the \"what it is.\"  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!  While the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure.",

The food here is prepared fresh and is simply delicious, and there's something for everyone on the menu.   We stopped in for lunch today, and made it in a little before the typical lunch rush. I went with their three cheese melt and a cup of their spicy crab soup. It was perfect for a chilly December day in Charlotte. Do not be alarmed by the \"spicy\" in their crab soup, it really is more a subtle heat, and I am one that is a wuss when it comes to spicy foods, and I gobbled it up! It really is a very mild spice that just warms you up right along with the rest of the soup. The chunks of crab in here let you know the soup is the real deal too! Simply delicious!   My husband went with the burger and pasta salad. I had a little bit of plate envy when I saw the size of the burger, and totally stole some pasta salad. Ask your server for some of their house vinegrette to put on the pasta salad, if they don't bring it out already. It's good!",

The waitress was really nice and apologetic about it though.   The vibe there was great. I can see why people say it's romantic.

They must have over 14 taps of beer to choose from along with a bar. We really enjoyed the experience of being here and hanging with the locals which is truly the best part of the experience. Thank you for a good time.   BTWThey are literally in the Fourth Ward. So a great walking tour of the area and the famous \"hanging tree\" down the street.",

I've been twice now, however, and both times I felt let down by the food. The food was mediocre. I had a chicken dish the first time and the second time a quesadilla because quite frankly I couldn't find anything else on the menu that was speaking to me. Maybe I ordered wrong both times?  If you are in the mood for bar food (appetizers), drinks and a great atmosphere -- come here. It will meet your needs and you will not be disappointed.

I ordered the chicken marsala, and while the serving size was huge, the pasta itself wasn't very good. It was under-seasoned and didn't really have that marsala taste, it mostly tasted like cream and cheese. The chicken was also overcooked.   However, my SO had the What Is It pasta, which he loved. So it seems the dishes are hit or miss here.",

I couldn't tell if they were all walk-ins from the historical neighborhood in 4th Ward, or if others, like myself, parked and walked. I had to use Google Maps to find it. Service was prompt and my server was someone who clearly had been with the restaurant a while. She knew her stuff. I ordered the Blackened Hummus with pita slices along with the Spicy Crab Soup (I didn't taste the spice). On a cold day, it was warm, although the crab was imitation. It was what I expected but tasty nonetheless. The Hummus (appetizer menu) was quite filling. I could not eat it all. My overall impression is that I like the neighborhood feel of the restaurant and its location \"in the cut.\" I will say that I found it rather dark for lunch and would expect that at dinner time. I perused the dinner menu and they serve a number of seafood dishes. Overall, I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant and will definitely visit again.",

    "text": "I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!  Parking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.    The food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \"crab\" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.  I will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon.",

    "text": "I would have given 3.5.  Some have given this place high marks just for being a great neighborhood bar but I am focused more on the food so can't speak to its bar life so to speak.  The obvious high marks are what others have already simply stated...great, hidden gem, neighborhood feel, house converted, bla bla bla...Yes, that's all very True.    Bring your glasses if you have poor eyesight because this place is very dimly lit but I think it adds to the romantic aspect and it makes it pretty cozy.  The service was mediocre...I have to give a shout out to the buff host that has been there all 3 times that I have.  He looks like an abercrombie model that moonlights as the host of Alexander Michael's.  He just makes me smile for some reason.  But as far as the wait staff..eh, ok.  They seemed overly busy and understaffed quite honestly.  I hated to even ask any questions to our waitress in fear of flight.  She didn't stick around and she seemed to just have too much going on in general.  Whatever, no big deal.    The food I think is consistently good.  The fried pickles are good, their cajun fries are crispy, good flavor, their other sides are OK, not amazing.  I tried their veggie and quinoa burger and I thought it was pretty good!  My friend had the burger and wasn't asked how she wanted it cooked so that was a BAD sign.  Not fresh.  Aaaand, it wasn't.  It was a little dry, not much flavor, just bleh in general.  The prices are right for their burgers and sandwhiches but they really should be based on the quality.  They have other specials and regular meal items that may be amazing but overall I think everything is just basic, consistent, good, not great.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but I wouldn't kick and scream if invited to go again.",

I was interested in tasting the crawfish burrito, but it was pricy ($16) and I assumed it would be disappointing.  Instead, I opted for a London broil sandwich, which I highly recommend. Extra points for offering Shine Bock on tap..a favorite beer I've missed dearly since Texas, where it's commonly served.",

Upon walking up to the restaurant I was a little afraid this was going to be a locals type place that looks at ya funny when you walk in and don't know what you are doing. This quickly started to escalate as we entered and there was no clear way to know if we were to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. As strange as this may sound I am legit afraid of those situations. I don't want to look like a fool standing around waiting until someone in the know tells me to sit down. Ok- back to my review.   Just as quickly as my fear rose it went away as a super nice man came out from behind the bar, greeted us with a smile and took us to a table.   Within a few minutes the waitress appeared with menus and offered some beer suggestions. They have an impressive beer list for a smaller place!   Both the hubs and myself ordered the London broil sandwich. His with onion rings, mine with fries. We both thought it was outstanding.   Our waitress was awesome- I wish I could remember her name to give her props, but as I mentioned above, they had a good beer selection!   Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu!",

If this place were dropped in the middle of London, it would fit right in -- although the menu would need some tweaks. I was with a group of four so we split a number of dishes and I got to taste the chicken wings, spicy crab soup, burger and blackened catfish. The wings were fine, nothing to rave about, the spicy crab soup wasn't spicy and needed a few extra dashes of sherry, the burger was solid and delicious, and the blackened catfish would make any southern fisherman happy. Not surprisingly they have a solid beer menu and the staff was attentive and friendly despite the huge crowds. If I'm ever back in this area, I'll be sure to drop by for a drink or quick snack.",

The map says 1.5 miles away and I don't have a car - going to have to hoof it.  Show up about 7:30pm on a Wed.  Place wasn't crowded at all and I got sat right away.  The staff was nice.  I ordered the Fried Pickles as an appetizer.  Some people say they are too salty and I say, \"Well, they're pickles.\"  They get paired up with a cup of ranch, but I think they would have been better with Blue Cheese.  Hint: use just a little ranch on your fried pickle.  Next up was a bowl of Spicy Crab Soup.  This is pretty much an enchilada soup with crab meat in it.  Not that that's a bad thing.  It's good soup.  But spicy?  No.  No it is not.  Main course is the Blackened Catfish Sandwich.  This right here is what I'm talking about.  The filet is a monster.  A tasty, flakey monster.  They pair it up with a tarter sauce (did I detect a pepper in there?  Chipotle maybe?) and some kind of other sauce that was like a chunky salsa/sweet-n-sour thing.  Doesn't matter.  I dumped both of them on.  It was tasty as all get out.  I devoured the enormous sandwich. The side dish I chose was the Broccoli Slaw and honestly, it tasted like 'healthy'.  Skip it.  Do the cajun fries instead.",

The historic building gives the vibe of a friendly, cozy neighborhood bar. We had the specials and shared them between the two of us:  Bruschetta salad w chicken and Shrimp Alfredo pasta. Both were delicious. The longer we were there the busier it got and the service slowed considerably. I noticed when we arrived and when we left there were open tables, but lots of people waiting to be seated. It took forever to get our bill, so maybe that's where things break down in turning tables. Good food, friendly but slow service.",

Not only am I in love with the little parks and the historic Fourth Ward homes, but I really adore places with character- and Alexander Michael's has just that.  Alexander Michael's is dimly lit, very old and bar-looking. We were seated right away but the restaurant soon had a big wait at the door. I can see this is a neighborhood favorite. I'm currently in the \"I dine out too much and cook huge portions / eat as much as I feed my boyfriend\" stage, so I opted against an appetizer and went straight for the blackened catfish. He got the crawfish burrito, which is funny because we noticed that we see cajun/creole EVERYWHERE since our recent New Orleans trip. I swear, I didn't notice anything cajun or creole before NOLA, which is a shame because I adore it so much. Anyway, I tried the burrito (yum) and enjoyed my catfish with sauteed vegetables. I'm being healthyish, you know. I'm sure we'll take a stroll back soon.",

More of a pub than anything.  Don't look to be knocked out by the food.  But it's good.  Had a half turkey sandwich with gumbo for lunch.  The bar is really cool though.  Good selection of beers including two highland beers from Asheville and other craft beers. I'll be back.",

Tucked into a small neighborhood uptown is the unassuming Alexander Michaels Restaurant and Tavern. The restaurant is in a beautiful, old home that has an historic feel to it, which gives it a great atmosphere and adds to its charm. The atmosphere is warm and inviting in a very low key way.    Alexander Michaels doesn't have a fancy or unique menu, it is just comfort food at its best. You don't come here for fancy food, you come here for  friendly service and YUMMY food! What I call Southern hospitality ;p  I will say you MUST order their *Spicy Crab Soup* it was fantastic and I must try .  This is a charming, fun, neighborhood pub that serves good food at great prices.",

My wife, daughter and I were hungry and getting hangry, so I \"Yelped\" for restaurants and found Alexander Michaels.   We were somewhat surprised that it was in a residential area, and I thought that my GPS was wrong on the address, but it turned out to be a nice unassuming place that I would describe as cozy.  There were rustic booths  tables and a bar, all in a dimly lit space, but it all worked.  Our waitress Alexis was very friendly and helpful and the service was prompt.  My wife went with the blackened catfish and I was able to talk her out of a bite.  It was very tasty and the dipping sauce that came with added just the right amount of seasoning.   I started with the Spicy Crab Soup.  It was good, although I didn't think it was spicy, and then had a Crawfish Burrito.  Man! Was that good.  The flavors came together to make a great meal.  The portion was a little much, so I over ate a bit, but it was so worth it.    We are trying to move to the Charlotte area, and we are hoping to make Alexander Michaels a regular thing.",

It is small and cozy with an an intimate ambiance but very casual vibes. The restaurant is especially charming during the Holidays when they decorate...lights and garland galore!   Whatever you do, order a cup of the Spicy Crab Soup to start. I seriously dream of this stuff- it is SO good. Cream based soup with big ole chunks of crab. The fried pickles are also an awesome starter.   For dinner, I always order the House Salad with blackened chicken and Honey Mustard dressing on the side. It sounds boring, but it really is incredible. Thick cut red onion and cucumbers on the salad the blackened chicken is so moist and flavorful. The honey mustard is also house made and has a kick to it- YUM. My husband always orders the Chicken Pita and gets a side of honey mustard to dip it in. I have tried a few of of the pastas, including the \"What It Is\" house specialty and the Chicken Marsala- both were delicious and packed with flavor.  Small beer and wine menu (makes total sense given the size of the space), but they have a full bar as well. Even through there is pretty much always a wait during dinner time (no reservations), they turn tables quickly and you can always snag a drink at the bar. The service is always quick and friendly as well. I truly can't say enough good things about Alexander Michael's- do yourself a favor and check it out!",

It's located in a residential area and has an interesting mix of pub and restaurant vibes.  We ordered a bunch of apps including the nachos, fried pickles, potato wedges and Cajun fries, all of which were pretty standard. Based on recommendations I split the London Broil and the special of that night, which was a mushroom chicken. They were both great! The best part was definitely the desserts though. We ordered on of each (brownie, bread pudding, carrot cake and Oreo cheesecake) and they were all delicious!! The best part was how reasonable the prices were. Our server was also incredibly sweet and helpful  Overall, I'd recommend Alexander Micheals for a low key bar with great food and character!",

It's very dimly lit inside and the bar area is pretty large with lots of tv's.  The staff was really nice and are very familiar with the menu to offer recommendations if needed.   The food is still the same..........average......they have many pasta dishes, wings, salads, sandwiches, etc.  I had the crab soup, which for the first time of me having tried this soup at many other restaurants, this restaurant had imitation crab in the soup....no words.  I also ordered the 'what it is' pasta dish, which was very dry blackened chicken over cajun cream sauced rotini(and it's not fresh as the menu states)......so I would like to rename it 'what it was' which was definitely not worth $17.",

We only make it to Al Mike's a few times a year because it's just so tucked into 4th Ward -- parking is tough, there is occasionally a wait, and quite frankly, we forget about it sometimes. When we're in the neighborhood though (usually for the 4th Ward home/garden tours), a visit is a must.   Service is always laid back yet attentive. They don't mind if you linger but you never go without something you need -- mayo, another napkin, beer refill... The food is solid, too. My favorite appetizer is the potato skins. Their crab soup is to die for. And, I know it sounds weird after I just ticked off apps with bacon and seafood, but their vegetarian quinoa black bean burger is my go-to entree. It has feta cheese and avocado on it. Simply delish!",

My friend asked if they had Moscato which they didn't have and the waitress did not bother to offer up an alternative. I ordered the daily special which was a chicken pasta dish and I was not impressed. It lacked flavor. I won't be returning or suggesting this place to anyone I know.",

When we entered the restaurant, this man, who was big on presence, strode toward us and showed us to a booth.  He told us who our server would be and ensured our comfort. A server arrived and took our drink orders. We also requested an appetizer, the black bean hummus.  We could have it with a kick or not.  Of course, I chose the kick.  OMG!  This was the best hummus that I have had.  It was served on a bed of shredded lettuce and chopped tomato, that added to the goodness of this dish. The pita bread served as a delectable anchor. Because we had ordered an appetizer, I chose a lighter meal for my entree.  I requested a chef salad sans meat with blue cheese dressing.  Fresh and loaded with vegetables, it was.  My husband got the crawfish burrito and enjoyed it as well. Wanna come back here.  What a charming spot.",

The food, on the other hand, is NOT good.  Spicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it.  It wasn't even spicy.  Not creamy, more gelatin in consistency.   Please, pass on it.  The London Broil arrived medium well, instead of medium rare.  Figured it was my error at being maybe misunderstood.  No, the waiter was quick to tell me I ordered medium rare.  Took it back and returned with medium rare on the rare side, just the way I like it.  By now, my companions had finished eating.  The meat was so tough, I gave up after a few pieces.  Nothing to write home about.  Parking issue.  There is a parking lot two doors before the restaurant. There is street parking all around if you arrive early enough.  Personally it won't be an issue because I won't be venturing back anytime soon.    Don't understand the hype. It a neat place. More of the neighborhood bar.  Not a good dinner place.",

It's in the middle of a beautiful Victorian Era neighborhood in  what used to be a general store. The inside gives the same impression, with its dark aged wood all around and old decor. The staff was very helpful and friendly from the minute we walked in the door. There's is a good selection of beers on tap but I was happy to see that they had Franziskaner, a classic hefeweizen, perfect to quench my thirst from the scorching heat that day. Had the London broil and Cajun fries for dinner. The cut is from flank steak so it can be a bit tough but the seasoning and flavors made up for the extra chewing. The Cajun fries were the right choice to compliment the meat, not too salty or spicy. In conclusion, it was a good experience and will be back again.",

The good: to contradict a previous reviewer, I found the beer selection to be quite respectable.  You've got mainstream goat piss, mainstream Irish, beer snob local, national and international.  I was very pleased by the Gaelic ale from Asheville.  Very pleased.  Also, the nachos were truly a work of art.  I can't stand flour tortillas but flour tortilla chips are great for this mouthwatering mountain of peppers, beans, tomatoes, olives, cream and little chicken bits.  The ok: well, I found my pasta - the Honey Chicken - to be just ok.  The chicken itself was nice and juicy.  I don't know what I expected from the pasta.  I think it was overall a bit sweet, and perhaps a nice pungent feta topping would have broken that up a bit better. What it came with was a bland kind of Parmesan, I think.  I might return and try something else on the menu - like their massive 1/2 pound burgers - and we'll see if it'll make me a fangirl.",

    "text": "This was our first visit to Alexander Mike's but picked it based of previous reviews =) and because it is not far from the Fillmore music venue. When we arrived, at about 5:30, it was still very quiet but began filling up fast (including other tables obviously going to the Carbon Leaf/Big Head Todd and the Monsters concert.) As soon as we walked in a server approached and guided us to a booth.   Food: We started with the Crab meat Supreme Quesadilla app ($7.60). My girlfriend had the 4th Ward Stroganoff ($13.75) and I had the Feta Chicken ($13.95) as entrees. For drinks, she had a Duvel and I had a Hefeweizen and Oktoberfest on tap.   As for the starter, I was not very impressed with the quesadilla. The menu advertises it has pepper jack cheese but I detected no pepper jack, just regular monterrey jack cheese. Also, I personally got two bites of crab meat (my girlfiend had several). Given the very mild flavors of crab and monterrey jack, this was a very bland quesadilla. Granted, it did come served with sides of sour cream and salsa and I thought the salsa was pretty good. I just would have preferred the actual quesadilla to stand on its own a bit.   For the stroganoff, my girlfriend really enjoyed it and would have clean-plated it if she wasn't a carb watcher. I did steal a piece of the beef and thought it was very tasty with the red wine definitely coming through. My Feta chicken was also good (how can you go wrong with Feta?) with extra props going to the sauteed veggies that make up bed along with the penne pasta. They consisted of broccoli, mushrooms, red and green peppers and red onions. I thought they were very well cooked and the white wine/garlic saute was very tasty. The chicken itself was good though a touch overcooked but not enough to ruin the plate. Be advised that, as advertised, it does come sitting in a \"broth\" so is a wet dish.   Our meal, including two pre-concert tequila shots ;-) and an appropriate tip, came to about $90 -- not cheap but we did splurge on alcohol a bit.   Service: Our service was excellent with our waitress obviously very familiar the menu and restaurant. As a plus, as it got busier two owner/manager types stayed available in the dining area helping out and making sure everyone's visit was up to par.   Atmosphere: This must be one of the big draws as AM is in an old converted house right in the middle of a residential neighborhood. All dark wood with a gorgeous bar, its easy to imagine coming here after work to just hangout for awhile. A couple of HD TV's are present, as well.  It is a fairly tight space, however, so I also imagine there must be times when it is standing room only.   Food: 7/10; Service: 9/10; Value: 7/10; Atmosphere 10/10",

First, I love this part of 4th Ward and make it a point to bring out-of-town guests through this neighborhood to show off just how cool Charlotte is with all its hidden gems. But my eating experience at AM was lack luster. The spicy crab soup was very good and I would come back for that. The menu looked wonderful and I didn't know where to begin . . .  so I went for the crawfish burrito cause it read as if it was going to be spicy and flavorful. Not so. All I could taste was the black beans. I took a bite of the London Broil sandwhich and was not impressed. I am still on the look out for a great sandwich shop.",

As many have said, this is \"bar type\" food but it is always so much better than that so I hate to put it in that genre.      We were seated very quickly as a waitress was already walking to greet us as we walked into the door.  We sat down & were checked on very regularly by whom I assuming is one of the owners.  Real cool laid back kind of guy.    As per usual, we got an order of wings (wild flavor) & I had my mind all made up to try something different today off of the menu (usually eat a burger or London broil sandwich), but was told of two specials that both sounded incredible.  The first one, grilled cheese with hearty chicken stew, is what I had.  My friend and his brother had the other special, meatloaf w/ onions on rye bread.  Everything was tasty and great as always.  The wings are hands down some of my favorite anywhere.  My friend also got some crab soup which he said was very good.    Hands down one of my favorite places in Charlotte and can say without a doubt have never even had a mediocre experience here, let alone a bad one.  Can't wait to go back.",

I have to say that the reviews for this wonderful local American pub are not misleading.  Dark old school interior with lots of bead-board wainscoting, a tin ceiling, and a variety of vintage print material adorning the walls, the place is comfortable and inviting. The place was full and bustling on this particular Tuesday night (despite being past the dinner hour). The host (who I think has been tagged as \"Ken\" in an earlier review was friendly and found me a table for one immediately (a great corner booth that gives a good view of the establishment) and my waitress, Traci, was flawless. Clearly a neighborhood haunt, a wide variety of clientele were enjoying the evening making for some pleasant people watching.  I really enjoyed my time at AM's, but I must confess that the food was good, but not great. The spicy crab soup was tasty, but not nearly spicy enough, and the 4th Ward Beef Stroganoff had a nice traditional flavor, but the sauce was too thin to stick to the meat or rotini or my ribs.  My personal business travel rules discourage me from eating at the same place twice, but if I were in need of a good comfort food meal in a place with some good energy, Alexander Michael's would be on my short list.",

Alexander Michael's is in a cute, old house in the 4th ward and has a COMPLETELY different feel than anywhere else in Charlotte. It is a dark, pub feel. I assume they would have mixed drinks, but it's definitely more of a beer place. They have a large selection of local beers, which I love. The night I went it was 100 degrees outside, so I wasn't much in the mood for food. I didn't see a lot of lighter options on the menu that I would eat (I'm picky), but I did try the \"What It Is\" pasta. So glad I did because it was delicious!

So I asked the server and she said it's usually only on Fridays, but can ask if they can make it for me, which they were able to so that made me excited. We ordered that and the Black Quinoa burger and told the server we are going to split both of them. When she brings the food to us, she had them cut each sandwich in half and give us separate plates for each sandwich with the sides. BEST SERVICE EVER.  Both sandwiches were absolutely delicious and the Cajun fries were great. I highly recommend this place and will definitely go back. Thank you for a great first experience!",

HOWEVER, once we finally got in our room and settled, this place was only a $18 cab ride from our hotel at the airport.   Perfect quaint little neighborhood bar with a downtown view, surrounded by little brownstone homes, serving local beers, local rums, and a variety of awesome food! This is the only time we've ever stopped in NC. If you're here for a night, looking for a good dose of awesome localness, 5 stars!   See YA tomorrow, Caribbean!",

Parking can be difficult as it is all on street.  I bring out of town guests here often because it is so different than what most would expect of a city like Charlotte.  I always enjoy their sandwiches and baked chicken.  I used to get grilled cheese and soup as my main order but it wasn't on the menu my last visit.  Their she-crab soup is also very good.    The drink prices seem very average for the area.",

We were greeted by a friendly man working the bar and he pointed out a small booth in the back that was available for us to sit at. It was a cozy little wooden booth. The atmosphere is warm and quaint with memorabilia and other random decor lined up and down the walls. Our waitress was polite and kind. We ordered the soup/salad combo and one of the specials. Any passing by waitress who noticed our water was low would fill our glasses, showing their attentiveness to customers. Food was delicious and their crab soup in particular was flavored wonderfully! Services was great, atmosphere was great... we will definitely be back to visit in the near future :)",

I'm a huge fan of the veggie burger and fries, and the prices are reasonable. The space is great, and I adore the 4th Ward neighborhood. In fact, I live there.   That said, I've been consistently underwhelmed with the quality of service that Al Mike's delivers to its patrons. On a couple of occasions I've felt as though the server did not really care much about my dining experience. As an example, recently I went with a friend who explained to the server that she was gluten intolerant and order the GF pasta. Despite that, her pasta came with two slices of bread on top. To me, that seems like something that should have been considered, and if it was an honest mistake, that would have been ok. However, the server acted as though it was preposterous that she asked for another plate. She was extremely disrespectful despite the fact that my party was respectful towards her. I really want to like and enjoy this spot and I think the food is great, but the experience of eating out is 100 percent framed by your service and on a couple of occasions it's been subpar to horrible at Al Mike's.",

They are great for a sit-down dinner in a wooden booth that screams old school privacy. At the same time, the bar is inviting to hang out with your neighbors over a pint or mixed drink at a good price.  The staff is the best in Uptown and as good as you'll find in the city.

I've eaten here a handful of times now and have been impressed each and every time. For starters, I've had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Quesadillas and the black bean hummus - both are excellent and definitely worth trying. For entrees I've had the Quinoa Black Bean Burger and the Rueben. The veggie burger is one of the best in town (in my humble opinion) and the Rueben is a tasty option as well.   The service has always been top notch as well. I've never had a bad experience at Alexander Michaels and consider it one of my go-to restaurants when I'm looking for a unique charlotte restaurant that you can't get anywhere else.",

Then finally, one day my wife and I were head south from LKN around lunchtime and miracle of miracles, I remembered. Very glad I did!  Really nice homey feeling as soon as we walked in and we were greeted quickly and in a welcoming way. There were many things on the menu that sounded wonderful and she landed on a burger and I had a blackened chicken sandwich which you can also get grilled or teriyaki-style. We felt both were great. In fact, the only thing we tried that was just good vs great was the spicy crab soup.   The service continued the theme from the nice greeting and our food came out quickly. Al Mike's is absolutely the kind of place any neighborhood would welcome.",

Parking in 4th Ward isnt the easiest. However, we were able to find a spot on the street relatively close. Alexander Michael's is an adorable house in 4th Ward. Please make sure to read the back of the menu for the story about this place!   The wait was about 45 minutes and the place was standing room only at the time. However, we were able to grab some drinks at the bar. They had Triple C Baby Maker on tap, so I was a happy girl! Lots of local brews!  We started with the fried pickles as we looked over the menu. Delicious ranch. For our meals, I convinced my Dad to order the What Is It, because I have had it before and loved it! I knew it would be right up his alley. He finished the whole thing and really enjoyed his meal. I had a bite and it was just as good as I remembered. I ordered the black bean burger with a cup of crap soup. The soup is absolutely amazing!!! Chunks of crab. This is a must order item every time. The black bean patty was nicely done and i liked that it was served on a pita, instead of a bun. Both my husband and mom ordered the chicken sandwich and enjoyed their meals.   Service at the table was just ok. To be quite honest, it felt fairly rushed, which is a bit annoying when you wait 45 minutes. However, the guy taking names down for the wait was fantastic. He was really on it! Actually, he seemed like a jack of all trades cause I saw him cleaning a table and bringing drinks out also! He was just so fun to interact with.  This is a great casual spot for a date or just a night out with some friends!",

My dad came into town and I had talked this place up as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. It wasn't even close. Our waitress was less than thrilled to be serving us. She spoke in short rushed sentences and took what felt like a lifetime to take our order. Apparently, her approach is to carry just one dish at a time from the kitchen to the table. She's also a pro at ignoring a table that has its menus closed and has been that way 10 minutes. She just seemed annoyed to be there. I chalked this up to her just having an off night.   My dad was seated facing the kitchen and witnessed pure filthiness. Someone with gloves on in the kitchen handled money from the waitress, and then passed her a tray full of food to be served without taking off or changing the gloves. Revolting and unsanitary.  Our meals were very underwhelming as well. I got the What It Is, my dad got the Penne Athena, and my girlfriend got a build your own pasta. Mine was alright, the sauce tasted like pure butter and not much else. The build your own pasta seemed to be fine. The Penne Athena was a disgrace. The \"sauce\" was beyond watery and the overall flavor was lacking. I could not have been more disappointed this time around, and will probably not be back for quite a while if at all.",

    "text": "Alexander Michael's is what you wish your local bar/brewpub was like. It truly is a throwback to what I imagine old neighborhood bars were like where yes, everybody did know your name and you always left with a smile on your face. Others have said it here, but I am going to go ahead and reiterate that this spot is truly a gem and all the people inhabiting the 4th Ward of Charlotte are lucky to have it.   What makes it so special? Well, as alluded to above, the quaint neighborhood feel of the restaurant itself goes a long way and its impact cannot really be done justice by words--you just have to go there! The staff is welcoming and friendly, and you most certainly are made to feel like a regular (even if you are not like this guy). The few times that I've been here, the tavern is always filled with jovial conversations, laughter, and a real community feeling.   The food is typical American pub food fare but done extremely well. I've never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered here, nor has anyone that I've come to Al Michael's with. In terms of starters, the spicy crab soup is excellent and the black bean hummus also hits the spot. For your main grub, the ruben, half pound burger, London broil, and quinoa black bean vegetable burger (did I mention they have a surprising number of healthier options?) are staples when we go. The side dish options also bring the goods with choices such as fries, Cajun fries, spicy black beans, or a big ol' baked potato (this option probably gives you the best bang for your buck!).   Right now your taste buds are most likely waking up but you're concerned about what you're going to wash all that delicious food down with. Well, stop your fretting because this spot has a rotating line-up of high quality draft beers with a huge emphasis on North Carolina beers and an even greater emphasis on Charlotte specific brews. Problem solved! On top of that, there is also a full bar and a few selections in the wine department.   Oh, and when is the best time to check this spot out? Right before you head out to a Panthers game of course!",

    "text": "Need a good, unique date spot? Here's the place. Great little hidden gem in uptown's historic 4th Ward neighborhood.  Food: First things first... whatever meal you get make sure to get a cup or bowl of the spicy crab soup. Money. Not so hungry or just want a snack? The fried pickles are spot on. The London Broil is just fantastic. The marinade they use on it is super delicious. Dinner version comes sliced up in entree form... lunch as a sandwich. You get a side item with both.  Bar: They have a good selection of local beers. If the restaurant is busy and you can't get a table... sit here. The service is always top notch.  Parking: there is a lot less than a block from the restaurant between Graham and Pine. There seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding parking here. I think a lot of it is because the signs are kind of confusing. You can park there for two hours without a parking permit. Bonus: had too much to drink and need to take a cab? The A Mike's staff will you show you where you can park your car overnight.  I love to bring out of town guests here. Such a charming place in a great neighborhood. Warm, welcoming, homey atmosphere.",

The grilled chicken pita is just grilled chicken, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes but it tastes amazing.  Get the Cajun fries with it and you will have a tasty meal!  The What It Is is blackened chicken on top of Cajun Alfredo sauce pasta. It's insanely good!  I've tried making it at home with a little success but it doesn't compare to how Al Mike's is! The owner and employees are all super friendly.  I really love that the restaurant is in an old Victorian style home nestled in Fourth Ward.  It's so cozy feeling.  Definitely a favorite stop! :)",

Walking from uptown up to 9th, you will notice that it becomes very residential and a dead-end, so you may think you are in the wrong place, but you are in the right place.  This is a local tavern, with the charm and hospitality.  Coming here makes you wish you had Alexander Michaels in your neighborhood.  The workers are very welcoming and efficient.  They are quick to take your orders, fill your drinks, and come back often.  The food options are great and too many to choose from.  I wanted to try the pastas as I saw several go by my table, but I went for the daily special, the boneless fried chicken and mashed, and a choice of side, and I was happy.  My friend got the burger and it was tasty too.  Top it all of with a nice selection of local Carolina beers on draft, and you have a great evening.  If I ever get back to Charlotte Al Mike's is on the must return list.",

Murphy our Waitress was outstanding. Food was outstanding. Prices were totally affordable and worth every penny three people with an app, two drinks per, meals and one dessert amounted to 100 before tip. When done dining be sure to take a walk around that area. Gorgeous! Thank you for a fantastic dining experience!",

    "text": "Great place for a quick lunch...a big part of the reason I enjoy coming here is it is a quick walk from Uptown, and the stroll takes you past some pretty funky, old-timey houses in the 4th ward.   Their burgers and sammies are all very good. I think I've had every sammich on their menu during one lunch or another, and have never given a single one a thumbs down. London Broil and the Cajun Catfish sammich are the best ones. And after perusing the bar menu, I have had to fight off the urge to order a beer to wash them down with every time as well, due to my presence being required back at work. I enjoy pubs that stock such a wide variety of beers, and this one also includes a rotation of fine ales from another favorite spot of mine, Olde Meck Brewery. I appreciate a bar who keeps it in the QC family!   This bar is quaint...maybe a little TOO quaint. Being that it is in an old, renovated house, the seating can get cramped at times, especially during peak traffic hours. Service gets bogged down too, both by the level of traffic and unwieldy setup. However, these are nit-picky issues that are easily overlooked when good food and hospitable atmosphere are taken into account.   I hope to come back when I can kick back and imbibe on some good libations! The food alone definitely warrants returning again and again.",

I've tried a handful of different things at this stop, but I always go back to the pita. Plenty of moist, well seasoned bird stuffed into a fluffy, mouth watering pita, special sauce, cheese and lettuce and tomato. If I'm feeling all healthy schmealthy I go for a side salad or fruit, but their onion rings are pretty tasty too!

    "text": "When I first moved to Charlotte more than a few people mentioned Alexander Michael's to me.  I had my expectations built up.  The place is solid and a decent pub/neighborhood restaurant.  I might have rated it better if people hadn't built it up to me so much before going.  If I lived near the place I would go pretty frequently for a beer or some food.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to get to it (like i would with some other Charlotte places).  All in all - a solid pub/neighborhood bar with some character but nothing earth shattering.",

It's very casual and a bit loud, but such a great atmosphere!  Try the fried pickles and their IPA's.  Great place.  Great food.  Great beer.  Will keep going as long as they stay open! :o)",

A restaurant with an intelligent sense of humor: read the back cover of the menu, talk to the staff, and you shall see.  The portions are generous, and soft drinks and teas get refilled without having to ask.  Crab soup, nachos, fries, onion rings, chicken dishes, and the London Broil were all perfect.  They had a good selection of beer and wine, all available by glass, but had to drive, so could not try.  The prices are moderate, which makes this place an excellent value, which I would definitely recommend to a friend.",

Plus they don't just have burgers, there are a ton of other options that are just as tasty.  They have a very impressive selection of beer too, so if you like adventure in that area give it a go.  It tends to get a little crowded around lunch time with all the bankers and whatnot, but still worth the trip.",

I typically get the blue cheese burger, while my boyfriend loves to get the London broil sandwich or the pita chicken wrap with honey mustard. The fries and onion rings are delicious too. Plus, it's non-smoking, which I LOVE. I just wish it stayed open later.",
