    "text": "Before getting a coupon for Beantown Tavern, I had never heard of it.  It's not someplace anyone in my circle has ever talked about.  After looking up their website online, we decided to give it a shot.   We got there early on a Saturday evening and it was already packed.  We even had to park quite a distance away down the small \"street.\"  Our wait thankfully wasn't too long; they have a lot of seating.   Being led into the restaurant and being seated, I looked around and thought, \"Wow.  My dad would love this place.\"  He's a huge Boston Red Sox fan and that's who this restaurant is dedicated to.  Red Sox memorabilia covers the walls and there are TVs showing the games.    The menu took awhile to read.  It's pretty extensive.  There was page after page of sandwiches, salads, appetizers, entrees, pizzas, etc.  It's your traditional American fare, but a lot more choices than you see at other American restaurants.  The entrees (pasta, seafood, chicken, steak) seem a little on the highend for such a casual place, but the sandwiches and salads are very reasonably priced.  If you know me, you know I love spicy food, so naturally I went with the Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  It was spicy and gooey, dripping with hot sauce.  YUM.  The kids menu is pretty good here, too, and only about $3 a pop.    All in all, Beantown Tavern was a nice casual place to go and hang out with your family or friends.  We had good service, good food, and enjoyed it in a casual and fun atmosphere.  Plus, you could return many times and never get the same thing twice.  If you're a fan of baseball or miss your hometown of Boston, this is the place for you.",

    "text": "We attempted to go to Beantown Tavern today to watch the Patriots/Dolphins game. We even called ahead to make sure they had the Patriots game on after reading reviews on Yelp. When we got there, they only had the Patriots game on in one room, they stated they would turn the game on in another room that had the Panthers game on 3! TV's. The staff failed to check with the patrons in that room, who refused to allow just 1 TV to be turned to the Patriots game (wait, isn't this supposed to be a Boston bar?!). We sat anyways, hoping after half time we could sneak into the \"Patriots room.\" Well, after waiting for over 20 minutes, seated at a table, multiple servers walked by us, looked right through us, and ignored us. At least 4 servers walked by our table, did not offer a hello, or even bring us water. After 20+ minutes of this nonsense, we left. Word to the wise, apparently Beantown Tavern doesn't need any business, so don't bother going. I'd give it 0 Stars but Yelp doesn't allow that.",

My husband got a burger and I got a chicken sandwich, both meals were average but definitely on the expensive side. The beer selection is poor and they have no local brews on draft, that was disappointing. Great place to people watch especially when there is karaoke going on. The highlight of my evening! We will go back to have a few beers and watch the karaoke peeps but will eat elsewhere.",

I'm guess the owner agrees ?  \"Nina K: For your information I wasn't texting/Drinking on my Job Duty (I sat down to wait for a beer,Thank you) Man up and ask for a Manger next time..Beantown is Not For EVERYONE so Beantown is Not for you guy!!!! I didn't give yu guys bad service yesterday so idk why you guys took that shitt on me.\"  Wow.  Popped in today because we were looking for a late lunch.  Our biggest mistake was seating ourselves next to the most obnoxiously wasted and offensive person ever.  Heard all about how he cheats on his wife with strippers, and which ones \"swal*ow\".  He yelled \"I licked her v*****!!\" about a dozen times during our meal at 3:00 in the afternoon. I don't blame the restaurant for the customer's bad behavior, but the worst part was that I felt intimidated to make any comments to our server or the manager.  Apparently he is a regular because all of the waitresses were basically sitting in his lap or rubbing his shoulders and laughing with him.  We had to get up and look around for our server to get the check, and she was sitting at the bar texting.  When we got up, the guy pointed at my fiance and said \"look at that guy!  He only has one ball!\"  Ok? Trashy place with scum of the earth staff and customers.",

We were a small group and we are obviously different looking than the crowd in the restaurant. The servers at the bar where very rude and no one offered to take our order or seat us. Then there was an open booth near the front and we asked to sit at that table and one of the servers told us that it was taken even though no one was sitting there. Like 10 minutes later a white couple came in and they offered the booth to them. We finally realized that there was a back room with empty tables and we went and seated ourselves and literally waited for 15 minutes before anyone even walked over to our table to ask for our drinks. They saw us seat ourselves which is why we finally got the hint that we were not welcome and got up and left. I think unless your a local in the neighborhood I would not visit this place. Very rude and unwelcoming atmosphere.",

The ribs were only sauced on one side. The good thing is they were half-price but even at eight dollars and $11 for a half and full size orders, I would have been disturbed paying the full price for the orders we received. The two dollars Bluemoon special was about the best thing that happened. They did cook the broccoli to my liking and a baked potato was not half bad. The salad was nothing special either but it was enjoyable. Overall not bad barfood. We actually came here to test the ribs so that we can order catering for our wedding party. It appears that we shall meander on down the road and check out Moes barbecue right down the street. To be fair we did have a decent meal for $27 including the tip. Be aware it is a monument to the Boston Red Sox and we are Yankee fans so that's why we only gave it two stars.",

We went Sunday at 3 pm and it wasn't overly busy; however, you would think she was serving a party of 50 all by herself. We never got our appetizers. She didn't respond to requests for drinks.

I found this while searching on Yelp for a new restaurant to try. The menu is huge, you can try some \"authentic Boston food\" if you'd like, but they also have other different things like hamburgers, ribs, and coconut shrimp. You'd probably find something you like even if you don't like seafood.   The atmosphere is very nice, spacious but cozy at the same time. The people are nice and make you feel comfortable. It's a casual and laid-back place with several plasma TVs all around. My friends and I left when they started turning up the music at around 9pm, because I guess that's when the \"bar life\" wakes up. Fantastic hidden place in Matthews. I say give it a go!  One last thing: their sweet tea is fantastic.",

    "text": "I moved to Matthews from Boston in August and was excited to learn of a local watering hole where I could catch a Sox game.  I went in during the week just after the lunch rush to check out the food and brew.  I was by myself and sat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and attentive, but never wiped the bar in front of me where the previous customer had been.  My draft was nicely chilled but had an after taste indicative of dirty draft lines.  The menu was just as described in these reviews, and the calamari I ordered were surprisingly as good as some back in Boston.  As I continued to take the place in and appreciate the Sox memorabilia, it became apparent that the bar had at one time not been smoke free.  The air vent in the ceiling was filthy with tobacco stained dust bunnies.  Similarly, most of the top shelf liquor bottles were enveloped in dusty under usage, and the mirrors in the back bar were cloudy and dull.  I began to wonder how clean the kitchen really was and if I was going to regret what I ate.  Like a previous reviewer, I agree with the \"Departed\" characters being at the bar.  Otherwise the place is plenty spacious, and there is adequate parking nearby.  In retrospect I think people go there because there is really very little choice in Matthews and it's better than nothing at all.  To top it off, I had to ask to have a TV tuned to the Sox game that day.  For my money in Matthews, check out John's Place, the bar half of Mario's Restaurant in Plantation Market.",

    "text": "This place serves up typical bar food and on my 2 visits, we had decent service.   If you happen to be in the neighborhood and are looking to grab a cold beer and a bite to eat, this is a pretty safe bet.   Their menu is quite extensive and there is literally something on there for everyone.  If you are watching your budget, they have plenty of good options under $10.   On my first visit, I decided to have a quesdilla (appetizer menu $9.95 w/chicken).  It was just fine - nothing out of the ordinary, but solid.  On my next visit I decided to go for the Salad with Ahi Tuna (also $9.95).  Again, it was good.   I like the bar - it definitely has the feel of a typical tavern, and I suspect that if you're a sports fan, this is a great place to hang out and watch your fav game.",

I take my kids here often and we can watch whatever favorite sport that happens to be on. Great \"local\" feel. My 10-year old and I enjoyed our lunch yesterday here on the patio. Very kind and attentive server, and the food really was good (daughter and I split a dinner entree). Live music on the patio to boot (this was around 2 or so on a Saturday).   I've also been here with friends, esp, when a certain band is performing here. Waitstaff is great. Acoustics are great for the band(s). It does not feel like your typical bar (hole in the wall). Really a nice place to rock out with your friends or just take your family.   PS: Not a Redsocks fan, but I still love it here. :)",

    "text": "I was in Matthews for a weekend training and the group went here afterward to chow down. there were about 14 of us and we were sat immediately on a Saturday night. Impressive.   The menu is pretty big, with all sorts of options. Feel like Chicken Parm? Got it covered. Hamburgers? Yup. Quahog? Check. (That's giant clam that's been stuffed btw. Ya learn something every day.)   I went with a simple cheeseburger. Thrilled I could add bacon, but bummed no guacamole. No avocados in North Carolina apparently.   So I should have ordered the calzone. It was giant and looked amazing. Unfortunately I was stuck with my burger that was dry and well done. And no bacon. Given that overall the waitress was not that attentive, I ignored it. To the waitress' credit, we were a fairly large party, and in general, sort of obnoxious. Pretty sure she didn't come by that often as she was afraid we'd order more drinks.   I honestly didn't notice this was a Boston or Red Sox themed restaurant. Maybe cuz I'm not from Boston and have only visited once, I didn't' pick up on it? I guess I assumed it was a generic sport-bar/restaurant because of all the TVs. It was fun to watch the last few clutch seconds of the Kansas game on the big screen. Until they lost. Totally F-d my bracket.   Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and drink and it was a pleasant experience overall. It was all moderately priced and the environment definitely suited a group. Nothing stellar, but nothing awful either, again a nice variety at a good value, perfect if you need to feed several.",

I can't say that I'd ever go there on purpose, as there's not much that stands out about the place to me...but it's never let me down as a good, old bar.  I tried to see the symphony in the park in Matthews earlier this summer, and it started to rain before the show started. The friends I was with decided to try to wait it out at Beantown. We drank coffee at the bar and chatted until the weather made a firm decision in the rain direction.   The servers are really nice, and the crowd is usually a little older. It's a weird older crowd, though...often quite drunk. I get the idea that it's the Matthews township's answer to the uptown yuppy bar. There's definitely a smaller town, lower key feeling here.   The restaurant area is plenty big as well, so it's great for groups. I've been out with friends here a few times, and it's always pretty easy to get a large, roomy table. It's a great spot for watching ballgames if you must be subjected to such an activity...",

    "text": "Make that 3 1/2 starts with judicious choosing To start with I decided to try this place out of pure perversion. I had just had some disappointing Marsala chicken at Fontanella and lousy Pork Marsala at Carrabas. So why not try it at a Boston pub? Ok the chicken breast was just meh, they don't know how to bread it and bake it like Fontanella does and the Marsala sauce was thin and again I could not taste prosciutto .... but the sauce tasted of Marsala wine and of Porcini mushrooms something that both previous eateries  failed at. Shame on them.   The grilled fish is generous but ... not so great. Sorry. But blackened fish works fine, it's lightly blackened and doesn't overpower the taste of the fish. The cole slaw is delish, why serve such tiny portions?? It's just cabbage folks. The onion soup is very very good. Like most everywhere else they need to learn that the proper way to prepare it is with a large piece of French bread toasted first, then floating on top to present the cheese to the broiler. Au gratin is not melted cheese floating about. Aside from that it was I said great. Burgers are pretty good although the chuck is a little greasy.   Tuesday special is a half price rack of ribs with fries($10) Killer deal, the meat was moist and fall off the bone. The sauce didn't win any competitions but was perfectly suitable for the job. Not sure if it was Wednesday but the special was pulled pork with beans for $7,95 and again it was really good and plentiful both.  For my money I'll pass on the more expensive dishes but if you KISS it's will be hard to go wrong. Given a choice I'd chose Tavern on the tracks but it's at the other end of town. Everything considered I'm happy having this joint as a neighborhood option.",

There were antique-style chandeliers and light fixtures that seemed out of place for a sports bar.  There was art on one wall and a wall of sports plaques.  The decor just didn't go together.  But maybe that's out they do things in Boston, which is the teams that this bar caters to,  My first disappointment came with the beer selection.  Not a single craft beer in this place.  I guess they haven't heard about the local trend to serve craft beers and haven't heard how popular some of the NC beers are.  My 2nd disappointment with this place is the appetizer menu.  We ordered several plates of many different appetizers and all of them seemed like they were right out of a box from the freezer.  Nothing stood out.  The potato skins looked like Ore-ida,  The nachos barely had any cheese on them and the fried pickles were some of the worst I've ever had.    Friends of mine had salads, one with seared Tuna, spinnach and fruit which looked good but that was the only thing in this place that impressed me.

Then I heard her at least 4 times say she did not have time to go home this morning to shower before work, and asking co workers is she smelled bad but it should be ok because at least she put on deodorant.  I would eat the food again but only carry out.  I'm in restaurant management and this is unacceptable.",

They have a nice outdoor area with lots of TVs to watch the games. Even more around the bar area. The bar area does need to be a little bigger but it gives off a smaller, intimate feel. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and the bar area was packed with local patrons. One of the new additions to this place is Keno (gambling game). I wasn't familiar with it but my brother, who lives in Ohio, was and taught me how to play...and lose. That's ok, it was still fun.

With that said, downtown Matthews offers SO MUCH MORE... settling on Beantown is typically reserved as the very last alternative to any alternative plans. I find myself loving the environments and crowds at Carolina Beer Temple, Black Chicken Wine Cellar, and even Kristophers more and more.  Some things worth mentioning -- karaoke's relatively big here, well as live music; covered semi-outdoor seating available; classic arcade games & darts available; NO POOL TABLES; parking can seem impossible, but it's not... just park towards the rear of the building or nearer the library.  Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... - Overall recommendation = 2.25 - Food taste and quality = 2 (extremely plain bar staples) - Portion size = 2.25 (where's the generosity?!) - Price = 2 (Carolina, Black Chicken & Kristophers are all a better value, least for drinks...) - Atmosphere = 2.5 - General service = 1.75 (many times lacking) - Waitstaff = 1.5 (general disinterested attitudes...) - Location = 4.5",

I usually go for lunch and the ahi tuna salad is awesome. I have also had the strawberry spinach salad with grilled chicken and that is very good too.

We sat down and soon after at 10:02 we're approached by the security guard (bald guy with tattoos). He came at us aggressively asking us for ID. I explained that both me and my friend are 22 and will both be drinking. My girlfriend is 20 but will not be drinking only eating food. He then said to \"get the **** out of the restaurant\". I explained that I am a regular and I don't understand why we have to leave. We were already seated.   He explained to me that it was the law. I told him that that was not True we go out frequently after 10 pm never with any problem. He said that in North Carolina restaurants are not allowed to have anyone under 21 in it after 10pm. We went to hickory tavern and were served without any problems. We also asked if it was a law and the waiter was like no not at all. I guess beantown doesn't want our business. Probably would have had a $60+ bill.",

She eventually showed up and led us to our table. The server was polite but didn't know the beer menu that well (wasn't sure if they had PBR) a pretty common beverage don't ya think? The one good thing about the place is the food wasn't half bad, I built my own calzone which starts out at 10 dollars and 1.50 for each topping, a bit pricey for a plate of dough. At least it came out hot and it wasn't bad.  This place gets two stars because of the bad service. It wasn't crowded (for a Friday!) and our server just disappeared after our food came out. Saw her texting and just wasting time with other servers. It took about 15 minutes to get our check. When we eventually left, I spotted the hostess on the patio talking to a guy and not doing her job. Seems like the place needs better management. Won't be going back.",

    "text": "A more apt title is BS Tavern. I didn't read the Yelp reviews as I normally do and went just based on the radio ads which make this sound like a vibrant hot spot where you watch your Boston sports (not just the Red Sox).  Instead it's just a dive where locals hang out for cheap beer. Full story.  Being a Celtics fan I thought it would be cool to watch a playoff game in a Boston themed bar.  And while they did have the game on, it wasn't even on the biggest TV and some golf was on as many as of the TVs.  I suspect they just leave the TVs on certain channels all the time and only change them if somebody requests it.  If its just another regular season game I would understand but playoffs should warrant special attention.  And while I understand many people probably could have cared less about the game, if you're representing yourself as a Boston sports bar then that's what you have to be.  That way when a fan like me shows up he isn't in for a big letdown.  Same way you wouldn't have a country western bar and be playing Katy Perry all night.   Another thing is I've never been to a bar where's its so difficult to get to the bar area.  As in getting to the bar seats you have to maneuver yourself awkwardly around tables and chairs.  Same thing goes for the bathroom.  Isn't this some kind of a fire hazard?  If say a fire did ever break out in the kitchen I imagine there would be a bit of chaos trying to exit safely.   In fairness I will admit that yes the beer was cheap, service at the bar was okay (didn't bother to try the food).  But still the one star applies for misrepresenting itself.  I went to school around Boston and know what the taverns like there are like.  And you are no Beantown Tavern.  Heck the Boston Market up the road is more Boston than you are.  You're just a cramped dive bar with a few Red Sox signs on the wall.  And there's nothing wrong with that...just stop pretending you're something you're not.   Maybe just shorten the name to the \"Town Tavern\". While I realize my experience is unique, it sounds like lots of other people have had their own story of this place being wicked bad.",

We were here on a Saturday afternoon and there was not even a wait for a table yet it took us an hour to get food. We were never told of the specials and didn't realize there were any until we heard another table being told. Of course we were offered an opportunity for a beverage however there was no follow up for a refill the entire time we were waiting for our food. Also after the food finally arrived there was no follow up to see if everything came out as ordered. I could go into more detail but as you can tell the speed and customer attention were quite lacking.  Now on to the food. I don't give two stars just based on a one time service problem however if a restaurant has such an issue coupled with bland food then there is not much to raise my rating. There was nothing inspiring and the food was quite mediocre. One person in our party had the taco salad and the salsa was just like barely spiced tomato paste and the shell not like the crispy tasty treat that you normally find in a taco salad.",

Lets go outside blah... smokers all around tables dirty, ok back in, now we are looking at each other not knowing what to do, the waitresses walking by us made us feel like we were on their way, not once looked at us or offered help, We see the couple that just left and a waitress trying to clean the table (not succeeding) we sit there and wait .....and wait....While waiting a drunk man walked in, all beat up asking for a woman that works there  about 3 waitresses answering all his questions, then he leaves they all start talking to each other ....Hellloooooo we are right there next to you literally staring ...nope they left.  15 minutes of waiting we looked at each other and without a word walked out, the hostes too busy on her cell to even noticed that we walked out.

Indoor outdoor seating, sports on the many TVs that completely line the walls. I posted pics of the menu. I decided on the mushroom Swiss burger and it was so good! I downed a well made Bloody Mary to boot. The restaurant is roomy and well lit. They play good tunes but not too loud that you can't have a conversation. There is a full bar you can grab a seat and eat there as well as booths and pub style tables you can push together if your group is big. Servers were happy and provided excellent service. Hope to return again some time. If you're a patriots and/or Red Sox fan this could be your home away from home.",

    "text": "There are certain times in your life when you really crave trashy bar food. However, if you experience that while in the Matthews area, turn around and get the hell away from this bar.   I stumbled in, maybe a little buzzed from Carolina Beer Temple (don't you judge me) and ready to eat something really bad for me. So what if the Yelp reviews of this place made it sound horrible? How bad can bar food be, I thought?  THE ANSWER IS REALLY PRETTY BAD.   The inside is charmingly gray. It looks like you're eating in someone's garage, maybe in the Soviet Bloc. Of course, the garish TVs all over the wall didn't add much to the ambiance.   Slowwww start to get service. We even questioned leaving, which in retrospect would have been the better choice. Our table was pleasantly sticky, which really heightened the mood. Started with potato skins. No real way to mess those up, so those were fine. I mean, I could've eaten the frozen boxed ones from TGI Friday's and had the same taste.   We skipped cocktails because they all used weird discount no-name brands and I didn't want a sugary alcohol hangover the next day.   Our waitress disappeared for what seemed like an eternity and then took our order. The Buffalo chicken sandwich was mediocre. Fries could've definitely been hotter and less limp. The nachos...wow, I don't know what the \"queso\" was made from, and maybe I don't want to know. I think I ate three chips before giving up. It looked like a plate of sadness.   Waitress just never checked on us the whole time, and we had to flag her down to get our bill. I don't think she was very busy seeing as how there were maybe five other tables and several other waitresses.   I get the impression everyone just kinda gave up on this bar.   This morning has brought me a cavalcade of tummy troubles. I regret everything.   In conclusion, listen to the reviews. I wish we had!",

I visited during the World Series during the week and surprisingly they did not have the pregame shows on. I asked them to put them on and they did. The service was not the best this night. Half way through dinner I had to go to the bar to get my drink as the waitress was no where to be found. I let this go though. So I visited last night and I must say that this is worse than the nastiest bar in Boston. The bathroom faucet had black substance on it that fluttered off the faucet as you used the water. The bathrooms were so discussing I actually would have preferred an put house. In the men's room some one committed in the Urinal. I sat outside and only went on to use the bathroom but I will tell you I have no idea why this place is in business due to health code violations. They need to get a total rehab. The floors are gross and I can only imagine what is on the seats or in the kitchen. I will not be returning ever and I am embarrassed to have this associated with Boston. Beantown Tavern when you decide to clean your self up and fairly represent win town the. Please message me and I will gladly return. Until the. I will pay to return to visit the bars on Boston!",

They have cheap beer options and the food is pretty good--the pizza is the best option on the menu. It's super cheap for the size of the pie and it tastes great.  We've had some issues in the past with the rowdy crowd the bar attracts at night, it is much more a bar than a restaurant so I wouldn't recommend it for a quiet dinner or anything like that. But if you're looking to drink a cheap beer and watch football, go for it!",

We asked the staff if it is aways very solid/gooey vs creamy/slightly thickened like bisque we are usually served and they said it was as we were served.

Looks like the place got a paint job and some brighter lighting and I am not sure if this is good or bad. Still pretty tight for seating and the crowd is middle aged beer drinkers. I think some are looking fir a little action later, but thats their business. Well, we decided to go traditional and get a cup of chowder and a lobster roll with cole slaw.  The chowder was average at best, a little too thick and potatoey.  It could have been warmer with a tad more clams but ok.  The lobster roll however, was not lobster, but some shitty crabmeat mayonnaise concoction with too much dill or fennel or something.  Shame on Beantown to try to pass this mush off as a lobster roll, especially to two old Bostonians. Yes its loud, the prices are ok, service was actually good tonight.  Now if she just bring me another beer.",

We ordered two burgers, medium, one BBQ sandwich and one crab cake sandwich.  We waited over 20 minutes for the food, while watching the cook chatting with the waitress.  Both burgers came out well done and the sweet potato fries were burned.  We returned one burger (daughter was too hungry to wait for another) and then had to wait another 10 minutes for the new burger, which was still well done. Husband ate it anyway because at this point he was very hungry.   Apparently cook doesn't know how to cook anything else. When we complained to the waitress her answer was: I don't know what to tell you.  What would you like me to do?  My answer: I'd like to speak to manager.  Her answer: well, he's on vacation.

As I walked by the space at the end of the drive, which I had believed to be vacant, I noticed activity inside.  After peering  through the windows for a better look,  I informed my companion that it looked like a bar inside, perhaps a restaurant.  As I looked closer I could see a hand beaconing me inside.  I walked to the door to be greeted by a man I would later learn was Donnie Gaskin, the new owner of The Beantown Tavern.  Donnie told us that he was not yet open for business and as such could not sell us a beer.......then with a big smile he said \"  But I can certainly give you a few\".    Well, we entered that day for our first beverage at Donnie's place and I have been going back ever since.  I am a lover of fine food, fine spirits and fine entertainment.  I am happy to say that the Beantown Tavern excels at providing all three.  It is no secret that I provide as much advertising for the Beantown Tavern as possible.  As a critic, some would say that this is a conflict of interests.  I would however argue that as a critic, as a lover of fine food, it is in my interests to promote this establishment to the best of my ability.  If you love something, and you want it to be there for you , you promote it.  Well, I never want to awaken to a day when I can not get a Beantown Crab cake.  I encourage all my readers to take an afternoon for lunch at Beantown, and an evening for a dinner.  If you really want to see good entertainment, then take an entire evening and enjoy some of the areas hottest bands and entertainers.  If you are lucky, you may even hear me sing.

Normally, you wouldn't find me in a bar full of Patriots fans, but this Boston themed bar had a good feel.  The owner, Donnie, actually approached my group of friends and asked us how everything was and if we were enjoying ourselves.  Of course I was!    There was a live band covering old soul jams like Curtis Mayfield and Isley Brothers and doing a damn good job at it too!  I chatted with the band members during a set break and they explained that they were also in a gospel group together and then cordially invited me to join them for service at Ebenezer Baptist Church that Sunday.  I enjoyed the diversity of the crowd, old and young alike.  That is except for the fourty-something year old that had one too many Budweisers and a taste for younger men.  It was hilarious nonetheless and I will definitely visit again.",

One visit we had to move tables because the air conditioner was leaking and dripping on our table....I really thought that was gross.   At the bar you will discover most of the extras from the movie \"The Departed\"....except I don't think they are acting.... I think they are placing bets, or are bookies, I don't know, but it was pretty mafia looking to me.",
