The nachos are nothing special, but definitely try the chicken waffle bites (with maple syrup and bacon crumbles on top).  Decent selection of popular beers in bottle and on draft, but don't go here looking for craft brews or microbrews.  LCD TVs over the bar for sports, live music on some nights.  Tables for groups, or you can just sit at the bar.  I'm not a bar hopper (just looking for a place to grab some beer and munchies) and I felt very welcome.",

    "text": "I had a great experience coming in early before a band started playing. We ordered a Carona and a Margarita drink which were good, the plastic cup didn't bother me because they are way to big for glass cups on a holiday evening with live music (cinco de mayo).  Everything was fine until it got busy, it became super dirty, and unattended.  They were super understaffed with a private party there before the night show on top of that.  The restrooms were terribly filthy and out of paper towels on one side, no hooks for purses so I had to put my purse on the nasty floor. When I went to the bar with my friend, she ordered a bud light and a PBR. I ordered two NoDa bears on tap.   Took us about... God I don't know... at least ten minutes if not 15 to get our drinks, then about another ten for them to fix their error, which I found out later they didn't.  The bartender switched our credit cards, he was spinning out of control literally, throwing cups behind his back and bottle caps on the floor. He was moving too fast, kept telling the group next to us to hurry up with their order.  He handed me my friends check which had an extra charge for a 2nd PBR that she didn't order, and he charged her for my two drinks.  I just got home and heard from my friend that they triple charged her card and they double charged my card for her order they got wrong the first time and then again for mine. I went today because we were hired to record the band playing, I will never go back there on a busy night, the worst experience with the actual vendor that I have had in a very long time, and we record events for a living.  Horribly managed place.  We asked them to switch the lights on over the band so we can record properly, we had to shoot silhouettes, all the lights were facing the crowd.   Just a horrible experience with the vendor, I've never had to call and speak to a manager the next day AND make sure my friend does too so she can get her money back also.   Be prepared to not have any expectations with them when you go on a busy night.",

If we ever go there for food, I'll update my review accordingly.   The second we walked in the door, we were greeted by one of the waitresses. There were a handful of people in the restaurant but definitely not busy. My husband and I decided to grab a drink at the bar, since we were just drinking. The bartender immediately came over. I asked for the drink specials and there were TONS.....I couldn't remember half of what he said cause there was so many!!! We both just settled for $2 Rolling Rock. I don't know if I was tired or the 15 min walk into Uptown made me thirsty, but man that ice cold beer was so amazing!   Looking around, the place is super colorful and all the decorations on the walls (like old school advertisements) were entertaining. We chatted with the bartender for a bit. He said there are 15 of these restaurants around the south east.  He also said they bring out live bands every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We were there on a Thursday, and he mentioned that there is usually a DJ that does his own screen visuals (I have no clue what its called) that comes out on Thursdays.   Seems like a cool place to grab a quick cheap drink and listen to some music.",

It's pretty average food nothing amazing but nothing to write home about either. We were there during a daytime sporting event and the service was really slow because they were busier than anticipated.  I have also been here at night. I went after the Miley Cyrus concert to hang out and have some drinks. It was a really fun time! Live music and lots of fun dancing. I would recommend stopping by here while out on the town. Overall fun atmosphere for nightlife but not so much for lunch.",

I was a little late to the party as I had to park when everyone else took the light rail.  It took me a second to find the place.  There are a lot of signs out front but I didn't really see one that had the name of the establishment.  The were under-staffed due to the weather but our waitress was still relatively punctual in her visits.  One great friend was nice enough to go ahead and order me a beer when they knew I was close to walking in.  So, all I had to do was decide on food.  I ate some leftover chicken tenders of others and decided that was enough to hold me off for now.  Ordered a few more drinks and watched some Olympics.  Everyone was nicely buzzed and having fun but not so much as to bother others.  I finally decided I was going to order some food.  At the same time a couple in our group asked for their check.  They got their check and they were over-charged.  They asked the waitress why their quesadilla's weren't the price as advertised on the ad on the napkin holder and she just said that they were't doing specials today.  She didn't think to say something when they both ordered quesadillas on quesadilla day?  She stood by her statement.  With a few in the party working in local establishments nobody wanted to bother the manager but we had no other option.  He came over, instantly fixed it.  No harm done.  After all that, everyone else wanted to leave, so I got no food.  I don't really get the theme here.  Country bar in the epicenter?  Will not go out of my way to visit this place again, but not completely apposed to it either.  Oh yeah, Epicenter parking is something like $5 an hour, and no one validates.  So, be prepared for that.",

I visited with a few friends on a big night.   It was the night of the McGregor Mayweather fight.  Place was packed!  Not only was it a great venue to see the fight, but I felt like I was their only guest.   Whenever I needed something, they responded immediately with courtesy and went out of their way to make me feel VIP.   Let me give you specifics!  There was an issue with the ordering of the online tickets to the event.  I called the restaurant and spoke with Yasmin.  She assured me they would solve it and they did.  Not only that, she gave me her personal cell to make sure if I needed anything, I would be helped.   She made sure that night we got there ok and the other manager was so polite too.    I couldn't have asked for better service.   I'm sorry that others might have had bad experiences.  Mine was awesome.   And I'll definitely be going back for sure!   Thanks again!",

Rude, bro-ish patrons that hassle the bar space and yell at bartenders for not pouring fireball shots fast enough. C. Severely lacking craft beer options. Which I get because Bros don't drink carbs.   I'll go back to Birmingham, Cincinnati and Columbia,SC in a heartbeat but I'm gonna pass on this one.",

The talent did off the cuff renditions of just about every 90s songs, some TBT rock, pop and r&b. Was very impressed with the talent. The crowd was mixed and what you'd expect for the Epicentre. I liked the Christmas lighting decor and watching people randomnly jam out to the band. Our bartender took a lot of smoke breaks and was hard to flag down every once in a while. Their beer selection was average and their wines were not my fave (sweet copa di vino Pinot Grigio - blech). Took some interesting pics while there and liked the unpretentious, grunge-like scene here. Would definitely come back just for the talent alone. Hope howl at the moon has decent talent too and like that they're both across from each other.",

I've bartended for years and even when you get slammed, you can still make eye contact with a waiting patron and say 'I'll be with you soon' or something. I was just ignored and had to hop around from one end of the bar to the other just to get acknowledged. Also, the air conditioning either wasn't working or wasn't turned on because the temp read 87 degrees on the thermostat in the bar. I spent $100 on a bar tab to sit and sweat all night. The Tin Roof locations in Nashville are awesome and have amazing staff but I won't ever be returning to the Charlotte location.",

    "text": "This spot is at the Epi center. Came on a Saturday night and it was a good crowd. The music played depends on the band and the night. It could be hip hop or rock or who knows. Its a relaxed casual place that can get crowded as the night goes on. It's a good place for the night time scene. They remove the chairs and table at night to accommodate a larger crowd and allow dancing. I would skip it for dinner, but they do have a late night open kitchen. The staff that work there are friendly. Drinks came strong the night I went. They have video games and dart boards in the back. The bar has dollar bills posted everywhere and you can leave one too with your name. They have the sharpies at the bar for you. Not sure what it means, but it's a cool memory idea. Went to use the bathroom....and no soap plus it was a hot mess. Told the manager and he got right on it. Overall good place to get a drink and good down to earth bar type feel. Not sure if the food and I left after the band played two songs.... so hope this helps.",

I didn't see the Mac and cheese on the menu this time (maybe I over looked it) so I opted to get the Hawaiian BBQ quesadilla with some tots. My guest ordered the Dixie biscuits as an appetizer and the VooDoo grinder as a meal.  I must say it was much improved. My quesadilla was delicious. The pork was well seasoned and tender and the portioning was large so I ended up taking some home. I did taste some of the voodoo grinder and it was good, though my guest complained it was a tad cold. The Dixie biscuits were much improved. The were cooked well, the biscuit was flaky. I still didn't get the taste of peach jam though.   I would go again and see if the Mac and cheese back or if I missed it. But what I had this go round was definitely improved from my last visit.  Christina said they will be expanding on one side and adding a club to one part and having the live music in the main dining area. Seems fitting for the EpiCentre",

    "text": "I provide a different perspective with my Yelp reviews sometimes- that of  a single person frequenting nighttime establishments by himself- which probably isn't of much interest to most people.  But this is Yelp gosh darnit and like everyone I must believe my opinion is of uptmost importance of being documented online for all to read! (thank you South Park- the TV show not the neighborhood)    I've only gone there for drinks and entertainment so can't comment on food (although I sorta do at the end).    Biggest positive is the staff other than bartenders (obviously meaning they will show up under cons) are very good.  Good in that know how to maintain control of the place and let people cut loose a bit without things getting super crazy.  Keep up the good work guys.  The bands they bring are solid no doubt but like with most live music in Charlotte Friday/Saturday tend to resort playing a lot of the same type of songs.  A lot of the bands don't do enough to differentiate themselves from the band that played the night before or last weekend.  With that said it's still good music which was has drawn me in here in the past.  I'll probably not go as much in the future though.  Not because of the drinks price which are typical Epicenter a bit pricier than most places.  But the bar staff really leaves a lot to be desired.  Not very pleasant for what I think a bartender should be where they should make you feel welcome.  A lot more of an attitude \"This is my job to serve you drinks.  Please tell me what you want so I can on to serve the next person.\"  Coming back to the single guy perspective, I'll say this which I noticed more so at Tin Roof but also tend to get the same vibe at some of the other Epicenter bars.  In general they don't treat the person out alone very well.  There's a bit of a suspicious \"What are you doing here you weirdo\" type vibe there I picked up off of every other bartender.  Most recent case was winding down a night of drinking there.  I'm someone who when I do drink I'll readily admit I like to pound a lot of beers but very rarely do I ever get out of control.  Yet my drink consumption was limited by someone who talked down to me a bit like my Mother telling me that I should slow down and finish my beer like being told I need to eat my vegetables before eating dessert.  Now I'm all for bartenders being diligent in trying not to overserve customers and quite frankly in the name of cash too often they're too lenient.  But as a single person I fall under greater scrutiny which is often funny given how my behavior is generally more reserved than most of the people there in groups.  So yeah call me a whiny little b- if you will but yeah it's not cool to be treated differently like this when you're there to have a good time and spend money.    I advise people to check it out if you're into hearing live music and get a sense as to whether it's your kind of place.  Like me though maybe you'll find after a while it's not all it's cracked up to be perhaps for a different reason than the one I have.  And for the love of all things delicious- you don't go to the Epicenter to eat food!  If you're going out on the town there's tons of great non-Epicenter restaurants which are a better value.  Hit that first and then come here for your night of drunken debauchery.",

I was kicked out from this rude manager, because of the way i was dressed.  - Dear worst management ive even seen in my whole life,  First of all, im not from the south, sorry my outfit offended you.  Also, the whole yelling was unnecessary. You could've nicely asked me to fix my outfit. I was enjoying the music, im pretty sure i could've managed to do smtg.  Last, its called a Bralette, not a bra.  (Oufit in picture)  (Make sure you dont wear a bralette and shorts when you there lol)",

The salsa wasn't anything special. The guac was ok.  Served with plenty of chips, no plates or utensils though. There are forks already on the table but it's kind of hard to scoop up salsa with a fork. We had asked for plates and were about halfway done with the appetizer by the time we got them. I did not bother asking for any spoons.   I ordered a turkey club.  It reminded me of the ones I make at home, kind of small not a lot of substance. I think maybe there was bacon on there though. Mostly toast. Actually I think mine is better.  The fries were crispy and looked like they had a pink tone to them. It was the lighting though. At least I hope it was.    Our server really didn't seem very interested in serving but she was friendly. Three stars for a fun, light atmosphere and good french fries.",

    "text": "I've been here 3-4x now so I guess it is time for a review!  I love the really cheap French fries when I'm drunk, lower-priced drinks compared to other local bars, and frequent live music. I like the opportunity to learn/play darts, however, they are inconveniently placed near the bathrooms so people constantly walk between dart throwers and the dartboard - this is pretty dangerous!   The live music is generally decent local cover bands, but they play too loudly for the venue and last time we visited (3 days ago) I found myself covering my ears! I like to go out and have a conversation - we were there around 8:30-9:30 and could not carry on a conversation, so we had one drink and left.  Drinks were $6 each, but I assume this is pretty cheap liquor being poured. We also paid $6 for a corona which seems overpriced. I'm sure we will stop in again if looking for live music, but I don't mention this place as a first choice location to hang out and I am certainly not rushing back.",

My only real complaint is that when it turns into a club at night, the cleanliness of the bathroom really takes a toll. The last time my stall didn't have any toilet paper but luckily some drunk girl helped me out. I'll definitely continue to come here, this is usually where we start our night in uptown to get a couple of their drink specials (usually like $5 fireball or something).",

The food menu was limited for people on the vegan scale, so that's a no-no. Sometimes they charge a cover at the door. Although the actual building is fairly new, this place has a divey ambiance. With a select few games in the rear. So to sum it it up, good place to goto for a Saturday night of dancing drinks and a few games.",

They may have been a little short staffed but we waited at least 10 minutes before being greeted. Carson didn't introduce herself, not even a \"hi, hey how you doing?\", nothing but \"what do you want to drink?\".  The only way we know her name is because we asked who she was. After ordering our drink it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks to the table (which were horrible). We ordered food which then took almost another 40 minutes. Meanwhile, Carson was in a corner seemingly talking to a group of her friends. Never did she come visit the table, get us refills on our drinks or inform us about our food taking so long. When one member of group got curious she got up and found Carson to inquire about the food and in return got a very rude remark and an uglier attitude. Food finally arrived and we scarfed it down quickly. Asked for water when the food came and ate the entire meal and paid the bill before getting the water. Carson sent another waitress to drop the bill off and never returned to the table. Being a server myself, I was absolutely appalled by this experience and am still heated hours later. I have never been treated with such utter disrespect. I work at a corporate chain restaurant in north Charlotte that has a clientele based on the elderly and university kids who do not tip but I would never and could never treat guests as I was treated tonight. Unless you like terribly slow and rude service, please do not go there.",

Live music, Dj's, sports, food, it's casual, specials....all in one place. The prices are great if not better then a lot of other places and its easy to get to. I've been there several times and never had to wait for a drink. The food is more then bar food and I thought it was great. The bar is long and the tables are spaced out so there isn't crowding over people. I would definitely take my friends there to hang out.",

    "text": "Bouncers act like high school bullies... We were there last night, me and my boyfriend had both of our beers taken away from us.  They claimed we were \"too drunk\".  We were then forced to leave... While drunk 18 year olds that shouldn't have even been in there were stumbling and falling around us, yet they were allowed to say.  Not only were we made to leave, but my boyfriend suffered a bleeding lip, has scrapes on the side of his face and he recently had knee surgery and in being physically removed, he injured it again!! I have a bruised arm and lost my Fitbit while there because the bouncer grabbed my wrist so hard that it ripped off and is now missing.  On top of all that, we were not putting up a fight but the bouncer felt the need to \"call for back up\".  This place was ridiculous and I will NEVER go back and I suggest if you're reading this, that you don't go!!!! It's sad when they can over serve 18 year olds and a couple of 30 something year olds get physically removed!!!",

Staff is the biggest bunch of scumbags I have ever had the displeasure of waiting on me in a restaurant establishment. Don't waist your time or money at this disgusting place. There is WAY better places to go to in Uptown. I don't normally give bad reviews, I usually only take the time to give good reviews but I felt compelled to save someone else from a horrible experience.",

    "text": "Hello to all of my people who read my posts.. I was so disgusted by this place that I had to write..ok so it's CIAA wknd here, and everyone is looking for a place to chill, drink..etc.. while at the epi center most of the spots are filled to the gills with people, so we wait on line to get in, after 20 min we get to the front door, I have my ID, but my boy doesnt, and he full beard of white hair, and they still would not let him come in without ID, so he's gotts run back to the car..finally gets back, and KNOW they want to charge $20 for him to come in, and all we wanted to do was grab something to eat and drink..so we clear that  mess up and walk to the bar, so we ordered wings and fries, and a couple drinks..I asked for a rum..splash of coke..so the waitress grabs two plastic cups, measures exactly 1oz of rum, and pours a splash of coke and it comes back with literally a half shot, and then has the nerve to say \"$16 for two shots??? I look at the cup..and I stare at it.. this is amazing..so I ask to speak to a mgr, and they explain this insane policy... then the food came, the fries came hot but the wings came luke warm and under cooked???. I am so upset with the customer service, with the food.. this had to be by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had..I dont know what they can do to reverse whats going  on down there.. but the place needs a complete staff make-over.. this was an EPIC failure..",

    "text": "Don't even bother! My husband and I stood at the door (I am disabled) and after being ignored by several people who work there I asked the guy at the door :Do we seat ourselves?\" Oh, yeah, ok. My husband found us a booth since I have a hard time walking and we sat. The waitress came and I ordered a vodka martini. She replied \"We can't make martinis\". I guess I gave her a puzzled look, because she went on to say \"We don't have a glass and besides, we're very busy. So, do you still want a martini?\". I asked if I could get a Bloody Mary and she said \"Yes.'  If you're too busy to splash some vodka and olive juice in a glass how do you have time to make a Bloody Mary??  My husband ordered a beer. She seemed ok with that, like bringing a beer in a bottle wouldn't strain her too much. We got up and left before the drinks came. It is rude to tell a customer that you are too busy to make the drink she really wants! Idiots much?????",

All waitresses were on their phones, very unprofessional and it took them a while to actually look up from their phones to see that we were there. We Came for food and drinks; drinks were okay, but the food was terrible. Very limited menu, we both ordered quesadillas they were terrible. The chicken tasted and smelled like canned chicken, had no seasoning or flavor to the quesadilla whatsoever, the cheese wasn't even gooey like it should be. The chips and salsa are a joke. They give you hardly any chips, and they were stale chips that came right out of a chip bag. Not authentic at all, and the salsa tasted like water. Good thing this place has live music, because that is probably the only thing keep this place afloat.",

    "text": "So last week I turned 21 and decided to celebrate during the weekend when all of my friends were able to. Anyway, I went here last night and didn't even make it through the door the bouncer was so ignorant and incompetent. I am from PA so naturally I have a PA ID, and yes I am very aware that it is protocol to be more careful with out of state ID's which is more than fine with me since I carry a real one! Now I don't know if anyone has seen a PA ID before but the holographic is very obvious and in depth (definitely a hard ID to copy and make a fake) and on top of that...THERE IS A RED LINE RIGHT IN THE CENTER SAYING \"Under 21 until....\" So I figured I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for the moron to realize where the date was...one entire minute later he looks up at me, looks down, makes a confused face and with attitude says \"ok\". Excuse me??? So now as if you didn't embarrass me enough in front of everyone around, you didn't even give me an explanation or apology as to why it took you so long to check the damn ID. So I walk in......and walk right back out!!! Why give my service to a place where disrespectful people are hired. No thanks :-) So thank you, Tin Roof, for really making me feel at home and welcomed!",
