    "text": "We were pleasantly greeted and received some menu suggestions from the cashier (order at counter and wait for your coaster to light type place) -- good sign to start, right?  2 regular burgers, some fries and a kids slider were ordered with their Kale Crush smoothie ~$36. After roughly 24 minutes and seeing people that came after us getting their food, decided to ask if our coaster was broken -- nope, waiting on smoothie. We got the food, while the burger had a nice char on it, the fries seemed slightly undercooked and meh.   Around the 35 minute mark, we're guessing the smoothie we were waiting on was forgotten, so went and asked, it was completed and sitting in their freezer.  As you can see, the kind service at the beginning was surprisingly deceptive. I'd call this a failure on their service on many levels. Nobody tried to figure out why food was getting cold or a smoothie was made and not picked up even after they knew we were still waiting on it. The burger was decent, if only the rest of their food and service were.  The concept was good and we were really hoping to like this place, but we'll never return, and from the staff's demeanor, I'm picking up they won't care.",

I've never had a bad experience there, other than some pretty long waits for my side of brussel sprouts to go, and they are always so pleasant and kind. They learned my name by about my second or third visit, ALL of them, and their customer service is exceptional! In addition I will say that the customer loyalty program is a big incentive to keep going there and the company is very generous and does a good job of keeping up with your visits and rewarding you!

I was very excited initially when this place opened but overall I am incredibly unimpressed. The only good thing was the drink options. They had real cane soda and other good options.

If you're crunched for time on your lunch break, then skip this place. Today I had been waiting for over 30 minutes so I decided to go up and ask about my meal. When I did, they realized it had been sitting on a shelf in the back and they had never buzzed me or called my name. When they realized the mistake they simply laughed and handed me my bag. No apology or even a simple \"sorry.\" This is unfortunately not the first time I've had a bad customer service experience here. I'm going to start driving a little out of the way for me to try the ballantyne location. Hopefully I have a different experience there!",

We walked in to order and were greeted pretty quickly, though I can see how workers may miss you if they are on the other side of the restaurant where they make the food. The setup reminds me of many of the trendy hot spots out west. I decided to try the harvest kale salad with tofu. I love all the add in options - garbanzo beans, brussel sprouts, manchego cheese, sunflowers and acorn squash. I was disappointed in the tofu though - it was barely seasoned and very bland, which almost ruined the salad for me. I think it would be a much more attractable option if they baked or charred the tofu to make it a little less chewy and watery, and add more flavor. My husband went with the spicy avocado and lime salad, which we both enjoyed, though seemed a little light. I love the menu and I think they have great potential. They even offer burgers, fries and some alcohol. I love the ingredients they use and their commitment to healthy foods that taste good. I'll have to try some different options next time.",

That works, but made me want to ask about the bread. I then was told that Gluten Free means no dairy. She repeated this 3 times and got louder each time and could not answer a simple questions without being argumentative when she's clearly ignorant.

Despite no one else ordering before us, it took us about 15-20 minutes to get our food and mine came out a good 5 minutes before my husbands followed by another 5 minutes for our sides. Overall the good concept seemed right up our alley, but sadly was lacking in flavor and size. For $28 we both left hungry and unsatisfied. I had the massaged kale salad with chicken and my husband had the western burger with sweet potato fries. We definitely won't be back unless we hear some serious changes were made. This is quite side because I have heard such good things about the chain from other locations, but it's not worth the drive or our money right now.",

When we arrived there were 2 orders ahead of us and all 3 tables waited at least 12 minutes to get food and orders came out 3-5 minutes in between. Almost seemed they could only handle one order at a time. Also, only found one napkin dispenser in the entire restaurant which caused a big bottleneck by the drinks and condiments.  Despite the operational issues to address, the food was great.  We had one grain and kale bowl, a salad, a kids chicken sandwich and a parmesean and veggie side.  All items got the thunbs up.",

    "text": "I was eager to try this restaurant when I saw it would be opening.  Unfortunately, after trying it tonight, I have to report that it was simply not that good.  I ordered a spicy avocado and lime bowl, which costs $13 if chicken is added.  The avocado, though prominently featured first in the name of the menu item, was small--about 1/4 of an avocado.  What's worse, significant portions of it were brown/black, not fresh or green at all. So after cutting out the dark parts, there was hardly any avocado left.  Besides the avocado, the bowl itself was surprisingly small with very sparse amounts of each of the ingredients.  The contents are placed in a large flat bowl (to make it look large, I suppose), but it had very little depth.  Both my date (who also ordered a bowl) and I left hungry.  When 2 people pay $30 for a simple fast casual meal and leave hungry, it is not acceptable.  Perhaps that would have been more palatable if the food were excellent, but the flavor was not to my liking.  Compared to somewhere like Chopt, Yafo, or even Freshii (all of which would have been less money for more food), it was sadly lacking.    I guess it should have been a clue when we walked in at 7pm on a Saturday and the place was completely empty.  The servers were nice, but that doesn't salvage the unappealing food.  Not to mention the long community tables were very uncomfortable, and the cloth cushions were stained and looked filthy.  I really wanted to like this place, but it was definitely a fail.",

Even the lemonade they served was basically water with a splash of lemon. I had such an issue with the grains that I actually asked them to give me something else (replaced grains with quinoa) and it was much better. So I would say avoid the grains and lemonade. Also, it was $30 for two bowls and two drinks. Seemed a little pricey.",

It comes with your choice of burger (beef, turkey, chicken), fries (regular or sweet potato), broccoli, apple sauce and a drink.   I decided to go with the turkey burger. I checked out the place while I waited and grabbed my condiments. I did like that they had a plethora of drinks and lemonade and teas. I tried the strawberry lemonade. For me, it was just ok. Not my favorite.   I found a table with no problem since the place was pretty empty. Then I waited. And waited. And waited. At one point I checked my buzzer to make sure everything was working ok.   15 minutes later.   My buzzer finally goes off I go to get my meal and sit down and it's cold. What the hell is going on?! What had I been waiting on? The broccoli was cold. The fries were cold and the burger was warm at best with a cold bun.   But I was hungry, so I just started to eat. And I was so underwhelmed. I didn't eat the fries or bun. And picked over the broccoli and burger.   Ugh.   I'm not impressed and don't plan to hear back here any time soon.",

Staff could tell that my friend and I were new and they were patient, kind and helpful.   I gave up red meat a few months back and I've really wanted a burger since then! So I chose a turkey burger. There are several \"styles\" you can choose from to add toppings to your regular, turkey or veggie burger. I went with an ala carte version, adding an egg and cheese to mine. My friend selected the veggie burger. Both were very tasty. My turkey burger was tender and more juicy than a typical dry turkey burger. I love sweet potato fries so i chose that as my side. I'm used to them being more on the sweet side but these savory hand cut ones were quite tasty! My friend thoroughly enjoyed her eggplant meatballs as her side.   Will definitely be back to try some of the amazing looking salads!",

My wife had a quinoa bowl and enjoyed it.  The kids had a burger and he chicken sandwich.  The kids meal had a good amount of food.  Both kids liked there food and were stuffed without finishing.    We arrived around 11:30 and there was one order ahead of us.  The food took longer than we expected.  Maybe that is because it is made fresh?   My burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was not soggy so they got it right.  We liked the drink selection and seating.  No major concerns.  BGood is a great addition to the area!",

My first try was the Power Bowl with quinoa and chicken from their location at Village in Ballantyne, it was good, fresh and very tasty. I thought expensive for the amount of food, the bowl was only half full and it was about $13 after tax, no sides and no drinks. I decided to download their App and was happy to find a second location closer to me in Rea Rd. Well, when I walked in the place didn't seem crowded but the interior service area looked busy and in such mess, dirty and disorganized, not only trash laying around the floor but peels of fruit and remains of trash sitting on top of the containers near the food on the counter, my disappointment was prob a bit obvious, when a woman gave me a look and sent a panicking looking young girl to help me, the rest were all frantically working on hamburgers, I had already decided not to come back to this location even if my food tasted as good as the other place in Ballantyne. Well $20 later my food did not only look smaller in portion, the grains were a old, I nearly cracked a tooth! and I had the absolute worst stomachache for two days. The smoothie was okay but Guess what? bye b.good and bye APP.",

We waited ten minutes until someone noticed us standing there and came to take our orders. This could be just a mishap, but then we watched the same thing happen to every customer that came in after us. It is definitely not good customer experience to operate like this.   The prices are higher than expected but the ingredients are locally sourced. Unfortunately, the taste of the food did not measure up to the prices even if the ingredients were local. The fries are terrible. They are supposed to be a healthier option with less calories and fat but that is what makes fries taste good. These taste like ore ida fries from the frozen food section. They were very mushy and tasted super bland. The salad was not bad but honestly Panera has much better salads. It just wasn't anything special, especially for $13 after adding chicken. My boyfriend got the turkey burger which was edible but nothing great. Average maybe. The portion sizes left me hungry upon leaving.  The menu has very limited options. Healthy can taste good but unfortunately healthy did not taste good here. The place was virtually empty and it's only been open two weeks. Honestly, not sure what happened to Boneheads but I never saw that place this empty once.   I will not be back here which stinks because it is such a convenient location. I will make the drive down to chopt to get my healthy but yummy fix.",

    "text": "b.good is a refreshing new concept among a continually evolving south Charlotte restaurant scene. It is, in fact, the only farm-to-table offering in the franchise-heavy area in which it resides.   Burgers and salads look appealing but I have stuck with the Kale and Grain Bowls on both of my trips. The power bowl, laden with brussels sprouts and crunchy chickpeas, was exceptional.  Service and was just okay and sanitation was acceptable. Will be back for a burger.",

Then I got a Black fingernail in my salad which made me vomit. I felt bad for the girl who lost her nail in my salad because she was really nice and apologetic.",
