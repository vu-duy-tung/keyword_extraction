    "text": "Why 1 star? Because of some of the most rude customer service I've ever received.    ---   ---   ---  I did not plan on writing this review today, but after some of the most egregious customer service I've ever received, I could not resist. For those who regularly see my reviews, you'll notice two common comments:  1) I try not to kill a business with a review due to one part-time employee having a bad day.  2) I've written nearly 1,100 reviews, and only 9 are 1-star, at the time of this visit. I try to be positive, even when a place doesn't offer a ton of positivity.   With that being said, let me paint the scene:  -My flight from Tampa-Charlotte was delayed, so I had to sprint from Terminal E - Terminal B while wearing Tom's and carrying 2 bags.  -I arrived at my gate, feeling like I just ran a marathon, only to learn that I missed the opportunity to board by 2 minutes. Awesome.  -I made arrangements to board the next flight and felt the need to find a good beer.  -How convenient? Right next to my gate was a restaurant/bar, called Whiskey River!   -I take two steps in to said establishment, look for the beer taps at the bar, and realize that there aren't any within sight.   -I turn around and ask the one of hostesses if she has a beer list I can see. She hands me a menu.  ***THE FUN PART***  -The other hostess (named Kaylan) then addresses the other hostess and loudly asks, \"Hey _____, can you tell me what the sign right outside the restaurant says?\"  Other hostess: \"See hostess to be seated.\"  Kaylan: \"Ohhhh that's what I thought! And can you tell me what the sign back there, just beyond that sign says?\"  Other hostess: \"See hostess to be seated.\"  Kaylan: \"Yes, that's what I thought too!\"  I drop menu back on hostess stand, and walk away.  Apparently Kaylan found it wildly inappropriate that I took two steps inside the threshold of the business to look at the taps, without addressing her first. She then dealt with the situation in the most rude way possible. I can't recall dealing with someone that rude at a restaurant in all of the time I've been writing Yelp reviews. If I were the owner, there is a zero percent chance that she would be employed another day.  I have never written a review of a business without actually purchasing something, and I have never written a review within 30 minutes of an experiencing a place. This situation was so outrageous that I felt like I had no choice.",

My water was always full, and my bartender made an extra effort to make conversation with me, along with other people at the bar.  My food order was placed immediately (Dirty Tots!) and came out in a timely manner, which is ALWAYS really appreciated in an airport. I think that most of the apps are served in a warm cast iron mini skillet, which is a neat presentation. Taste was on point as well!    Anyways, I can't really give this place 5 stars, but it was a really great experience to have. Glad to know that there's an adequate dining experience in lonely 'ol Terminal E.",

I get that higher prices should be expected at an airport but that is ridiculous. Second, a burger cooked to medium should not be bright red and cold to the touch in the middle. Third, apparently they soak their burger buns in the sink before putting burgers on them. To top it all off, the service is well below average, even for an airport joint.  The only reason for 1 star (vs no stars) is the fact that they had a single local beer in tap and one of the bartenders was easy on the eyes.",

To replace that pile of dog food, I ordered chili cheese fries (I know, I'm a real health nut!) and they came out with a strange soupy mix that made the fries soggier than soft boiled eggs...  maybe a fork of meat, a dozen red beans and some shredded cheese sprinkled very lightly on top of the potato soup.

She came back after a few minutes and had another guests food who ordered 10 minutes after I had, she said mine should be out soon. I asked her to refund me because my flight was being sat. She told me she wanted to get the manager and check on the food again. After a couple more minutes, I told the other hostess about what was going on, she said okay and continued seating other guests. The manager finally came up front, at this point my girlfriend had the flight being held, he started asking me about my order and I told him my flight was about to leave and I needed my money back. After him playing with the computer and showing no urgency I told him forget it. $15 wasn't worth me missing my flight. After that he got me my money and I had to run to my flight.

I am assuming that since they figure 90% will never return thru the area, that they can do such a bad job with both.  Too expensive for food that you honestly believe you will get sick off of if you take more than a bite.

They also have a large bar space and a huge wall covered in belt buckles- I was sold.   I was seated immediately and the waiter was prompt and attentive. I had a glass of wine, which was actually pretty decent. But my sandwich was the real star of the show! I loved the brisket grilled cheese. Although it could've been a little cheesier, it was packed full of delicious brisket. There are many sides to choose from, and their fries were pretty good. This is a neat little place to grab a drink or some food if you have time to kill in the airport.",

We got the pulled pork sandwich and the brisket grilled cheese and thought they were just fine, especially for airport food. The brisket was a little saltier than I would have personally preferred. However, plus one star for some really excellent service. Everyone was warm and welcoming, and our water glass never went past half full without being refilled.",

The bland, overcooked burger was bathed in \"guac\" that I suspect had been stored for a month in a 55-gallon barrel that was previously used to hold stale oil or unfortunate gangster corpses, along with a generous dump of a some indiscernible \"chipotle\" sauce (which I suspect has less to do with chipotle peppers and perhaps more to do with the contents of the mop bucket after a Chipotle restaurant's late night cleanup. It all came delivered on a Wonder bun and came with a side of tasteless, anemic fries.   I admit that I get sucked in by anything that has \"whisky\" or \"whiskey\" in the name, suspecting that I can at least get a tasty libation. But either the bartender is missing a finger or they have children pouring at the bar. A single is also known as \"one finger\", principally because you measure it according to the thickness of, well, a real finger. But if you're digitally impaired, I guess you have to wing it.   This place just totally sucks.",

    "text": "I love a good airport bar. In fact, they are second only two a solid hotel bar. Why is this? The hustle and bustle of people coming and going; the random oddballs you sit next to and converse with that you will never see again; that first sip of a drink that you enjoy even more knowing that you are about to embark on vacation. All of this makes the inflated prices at these places somewhat tolerable.  So when I found myself on a two and half hour layover in CLT while en route to Myrtle Beach last week, I jumped at the chance to partake in some airport bar eating and drinking.   Charlotte/Douglas is home to one of my favorite airport bars, Rum Bar and Grill (formerly Bacardi Grill). And despite the map saying that it was adjacent to the terminal where I was, I just couldn't find it. So I stumbled into Whisky River and found a random seat. I was greeted by a bartender who was somewhat pleasant, though seemingly indifferent.  I ordered a beer and a BBQ chicken salad. As is usually the case at an airport lounge, the food and drink came out rather quickly, but I wasn't especially excited by the salad.  It was a little too heavy on the BBQ flavor to the point that the lettuce bordered on soggy. The flavor was solid, but the wet consistency of the salad itself weirded me out.   Maybe it was the day or the time of day, but the vibe at Whisky River just didn't seem one that was particularly enjoyable or friendly.  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't looking for a boisterous and drunken time (like that time my buddy and I tied one on at Gordon Biersch in Atlanta-Hartsfield during a 3 hour layover flying home from FLL), but I'd have liked more interaction with the bartender, server, or even fellow patrons. Also, for a whisky bar, there didn't seem to be that many options. I may be wrong (I'm not much of a whisky drinker), but I didn't see that wide a variety of whisky choices.  With whisky being in the name of the place, one would think there would be a plethora of whisky. Incidentally, I didn't see anything river-themed, but I suppose there's a story behind the name (I think Dale Earnhardt Jr. owns these restaurants...so maybe the name has something to do with him).   All in all, not a terrible place, just not one that I would plan to go back to should I find myself on a layover in CLT again.",

    "text": "Here's how I look at it - it's 4 stars for airport dining. Should I compare it to dining out in the real world where a bottle of water isn't $5?  Or should I compare it to the fare located in this locked down area?  You know, like prison food. Do you think prisons compare it to food on the outside or to other facilities?  So this was a good salad. Probably small for some people but it was perfect for lunch. Salad and two Diet Cokes were $17. That's a total bargain in and out of an airport. The chicken definitely tasted buffaloie (saying it tasted like buffalo sends the wrong message - you get my point though: you could tell it was buffalo but my mouth is not on fire) and the veggies seemed fresh and clean. No brown lettuce. Waitress was nice. And I was in and out in about half an hour.  My personal rule for dining in any airport where there's a waitress is to have an hour between then and my flight. Anything less you're worried the kitchen may be too slow when it's really just on Reginald outside the airport timing.   Whiskey River is in Terminal E and once you get her you may not be up for traveling back to another Terminal. If you come in something else it always seems like E is the farthest away. It is the only place to dine currently in E with wait staff which to me usually means the only place you can grab a drink.   Cheers.",

    "text": "So I probably should have looked at the Yelp reviews before I decided to eat here.  Since we live in the Charlotte area we don't typically eat at the airport, and as we were transferring from one flight to another flight to visit more of our family we opted for this restaurant since it was close to our departure gate.  Big mistake!  First off make sure you have plenty of time to hang around, it's a long wait to get your food and if you have less than 45 minutes between flights do not order any food.  If you just want to hang out and drink and listen to the live music it's actually a good choice, the guitar player was really good.  We ordered the smothered chicken, the salmon and the wings.  We were told that the delay was due to my chicken, and when we realized we didn't have enough time we explained to the server that our flight boarded in ten minutes and asked for our food to go.  Our server greeted us with a look of indifference that  led me to believe that we were the only people that ever had to ask for our food to go.  That being said, we packed up our stuff, were handed the three styrofoam cartons and pointed to the lady at the front desk who was the keeper of the to go bags and silverware.  She was equally unfriendly.  We headed to our flight, opened up the styrofoam containers and began to eat our chewy salmon and chicken (it was a battle with the plastic knife and fork but I eventually won it!) and the cold fries.  So given that I was told we had to wait for my chicken I would have thought the fries would be warm?  So here's what I think.  Backed up/poorly organized kitchen, needed an excuse so they blamed it on my chicken and when I called on it they did all they could think of in terms of blowing us off.  I did tip the server 15%, although my wife challenged me as to why I did that, and I assumed it was the kitchen.  I'm not so sure now.  There are so many better places in the Charlotte airport, I would encourage you to skip this one and try something else.",

With high turnover in an airport place, you need to staff it right. Dont sit down if you are going to be in a hurry. Beer selection was great. Watched two folks wait on their check for way too long. My Texas Club sandwich tasted alright...kind of small for $13, but hey, its an airport. Tater tots...barely hot. If you are a savvy traveller and can roll with the puncges, not a bad place. And by the way Breakfast is SOLID. Have eaten here at least a handful of times prior to an early flight. Cheers and good travels!!!",

    "text": "For the record, I'm not one to typically complain. I usually just let go of things and move on, but I feel the need to warn all who may go here! I was seated very quickly (granted, I was by myself) while I waited for what ended up being 3 canceled AA flights- joy. My server was fast, but not very friendly (was a shorter man of Asian descent probably in his 40's). I felt as if I was a burden to him simply by being present.  I got my meal (smothered chicken) after about 20 mins, but it was cold and seemed as if it'd been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time. The chicken was mediocre. The BBQ sauce had begun to thicken by the time I got it, though, like it does when it sits out for a long time. While the fries were well seasoned, they were mostly soggy. But I was so hungry at the time, it didn't matter much to me (at least not until my stomach was tore up later!).   I also ordered their version of a margarita (which evidently is $17 and costed more than my meal, and, shocker, the prices aren't listed on the menu so you're in for a good surprise if you get an alcoholic beverage), and it tasted terrible. I can usually get a poor tasting drink down, but this one I couldn't manage taking more than two swigs from. It didn't even taste like it should have. Pretty positive it was a glass full of just straight sour mix. I drink LIT's often, so I can tell when someone has a heavy hand with the sour mix. This was FAR beyond a heavy hand with the sour mix. Made me want to puke.   Anyway, when I asked my waiter to take the $17 drink off my receipt, he was pretty rude about it. I drank my whole glass of water but only two sips from the margarita. It's obvious it wasn't good, but he acted as if I was trying to just get out of paying for it, though clearly that was not the case! He reluctantly took it off the receipt but copped a tude about it. Said I should have known it was going to be that expensive. Though, regardless, it was pure shit. If it had been delicious, I'd have gladly coughed up the money for it and even gotten another considering how my day had been going thus far.   So- service was fast, but everything else was sub par to terrible. The live music was good, however! But the waiter was a dick.",

At this point, I really just wanted to see how long it would take.  Dale Jr. needs to get his pit crew working on expediting things here.

It took forever to get our drinks and all we asked for was water. Once our order was placed we again waited for an extraordinary length of time. While we finished our food not once did our waitress come back and check on us or offer to refill our drinks. One of the waitresses was more interested in taking snaps by the bar then serving her customers in the not overly crowded restaurant.   If you're looking for a place to kill a long layover this place will definitely fulfill your needs as you will be here for over 2 hours. If however you're looking to make a tight connection your better off hitting up another joint.",

Hostess was a bit rude to us, but we were hungry. Manager came out and told us we couldn't all sit together. We told him we were fine waiting, then no one ever came and checked with us again. We ate somewhere else then came back to get drinks. There were only 6 seats at the bar so we grabbed a chair from a nearby EMPTY table. The bartender told us that was absolutely not allowed. We asked for the manager(same toothless guy as before) who basically told us they were only allowed to have a certain number of seats at the bar. I just don't understand what kind of customer service this is?? I will tell everyone i come in contact with to NEVER spend money at Whiskey River!!!",

They serve alcohol after 12 noon. Our waiter was rude about it after I said that's all I really wanted for breakfast.  We went ahead and ordered breakfast. I got the classic breakfast with 2 eggs your way. I asked to have them poached, the waitress laughed  .....and said either fried or scrambled.  Why advertise your way if it's only prepared two ways.  My husband got the large breakfast which was just like mine except they put 4 tbs of grits under his eggs, oh did I mention they only serve cold white un_toasted toast",

This is not fine dining but was great for a drink, and a bite while seated. It IS in the airport, so it's loud, busy and needs to be treated in a category of its own.   The terminal could use a bigger bathroom (there is none in the restaurant) and the menu could use a couple of healthier choices...but we got what we needed and moved on! Cheers!",

All-in-all, it was an expensive small burger but the atmosphere was good and so was the beer. With that, I'll give it 4-stars.

The only thing I didn't like is there were no croutons :(   And the dressing was definitely all at the bottom of the bowl.  Not a deal breaker though as it was still a tasty salad!  What I liked:  There was a device on the table where you could press buttons to summon your service, pay, or cancel the order.  The servers all had devices on their wrists (like a watch) so that they could attend to the tables.  Good to have when you need to get in and out quick!  I mean who wants to miss their flight over a lunch??    All in all not a bad place to hang out for a few.  (Yes, there is a bar there too!)",

You know you're on to something when you round the corner and a wall full of belt buckles awaits you. Then you look at the menu and realize all of the usual items await; brisket, pulled pork, slaw, banana pudding. I went with the pulled pork (comes with slaw AND a side) plate. For $12, I was even more surprised. When I asked what was on tap, I was told about German mead. I had to try it at least once (actually, twice).       The hostess and waitress were friendly and the order was out fairly quick. If you are seated in just the right spot, you almost forget you're at a airport. The live music helped with that. I will be sure to visit the second location (in Charlotte) if I am ever in town for a day.  *Insider's Tip -Seating is basically \"fill a empty chair\". If there's one beside you, then expect company. If you have a personal space bubble, either have a couple of friends with you or pick another spot.",

It had all of the flavor and not too much spice. The biscuit soaked up the honey like a good bread pudding.   Jennifer was an excellent server and made sure everything was cooked as I ordered it. Chef Carlos knows how to make some serious scrambled eggs and I love love love the texture, cheesiness and creaminess struck the perfect balance for me. I may just have to come back here during my next layover :)",

She was 3 time hide and seek of the Eastern US. Manager never showed up... Went to the bar and asked again for a manager. Miraculously my salad shows up after at least 40 minutes. Never once got a refill. This place has good food. The service is a joke and that is being very nice. I work here along with many other international airports. You will never get a good recommendation until the service staff improves. .0000001 stars",

The hostess asked my name and I gave it to her despite at least 8 open tables I could see. Another gentleman checked in behind me and we proceeded to stand there for 10 minutes as other guests left and vacated more tables. Finally the hostess asked, do you want a table? I said, I thought that's why I was standing here. She said, do you two mind sharing a table? I said, why, you have at least 10 tables open. She said but those are 4 tops. Now I frequent airports every week and have never been not given an empty table. Ridiculous!!!!",

I told the hostess that I needed to catch a flight, and I asked her about the fastest item on the menu. When the waitress came to get the drink order, I asked for \"Water, please, and the fastest item on the menu: the pulled pork sandwich.\" She smiled, nodded, collected the menu and a few minutes later brought the water. After 35 minutes, I realized that I'd have less than 5 minutes to wolf down a sandwich that arrived now. The man next to me received his food and I asked him how long between ordering and receiving food; 45 minutes, he said. I had to leave. Now here is the crazy thing... I eat at a lotta bbq joints, some are literally twice as busy as this place, and a pulled pork sandwich typically take FIVE minutes. This place here is at an airport, for goodness sake. Get your act together. Zero stars, but cannot post with less than one.",

BINGO - she brought fries when my friend said \"no fries\". Her burger was dry and inedible. I ordered a black and blue burger with a veggie patty substitute and I got a mushroom and Swiss burger. Wait?? WHAT??? There was some slight empathy from the waitress but it didn't feel very genuine. I'm sitting here now waiting for her to offer to bring my bill. Tick tick!!! I think she accidentally asked once if we needed anything else but she hasn't been back since.  Update - Chanel is getting ready to clock out soon so she's going around asking people to settle their bills now before she goes. Good thing it's all about her. Good riddance!

They were all 'sit down and don't bother me' from the moment we walked in. When they brought something to the table, there was little if any eye contact and none of the typical small talk you usually get from the waitress. We watched her clean multiple tables while our drinks sat at the bar getting warm even though we had mentioned that our flight was not too far out and so we were In a bit of a hurry. My wife got the brisket quesadillas which were great. I got the buffalo chicken wrap with tots. Unfortunately the ONLY thing I could taste in mine was the buffalo sauce, and the tots were overcooked and cold. When I told the manager about it, they swapped my dish for quesadillas and after that the waitress warmed up a bit... but next time I am in the Charlotte airport, I will taxie on by Whiskey River.",

Maybe they don't like animals? However, they are to offer service to everyone. Right? Don't feel as though this would be a place to pick again in the airport but it was close to the E concourse so I dealt with it.

Choose any place but this one as they don't want to serve you unless you're more then one body. The belt buckles on the wall was cool to see though. Just service was bad.",

    "text": "This was a difficult review to write as I find airport restaurants (and I travel every week) to be 3 stars or less mostly because either the customer service is subpar or the food is mediocre to trash. In this case, the wait time was terrible. The design of the restaurant is very Nashville'ish with a live country singer, whisky barrels here or there and belt buckles hanging on the wall. They were completely packed so maneuvering around was a challenge.   It actually didn't take that long to be seated at one of my least favorite places, the infamous communal table. Another gentleman was seated right after me and across from me. We waited for quite a long time (15 minutes) for our server to come over to take our order. I was about ready to leave when he did come over. At that point I knew what I wanted to ordered a beer and a veggie burger. Another customer was seated right next to me and our server took his order a few minutes later. Both received their drink before I did and so I waited and waited. Eventually the server came over and told me that they had to change out the keg and he would bring my drink over. He did about 5 minutes later. About 5 minutes after that my food arrived and it was actually delicious.   My server came back over to check on me and I told him to bring my check since I knew it would take an hour or so to get it. He was fairly prompt with that.   So would I go back: yes. While the wait was terrible (1 star), the customer service was 4 star and the food was 5 star.",

A few burger and fries. Wings salad etc. not much to choose from. The burger was definitely a frozen party. Fries were ok. But service was horrible. Though it was busy there was more than enough staff working and some standing around doing nothing yet the waitress never came to see if everything was ok. I flagged her down to ask for napkins and she never brought any then I finally had to flag her down to get my bill. I would have got a dessert if the waitress had ever come back to check on me. But I said forget it. Next time I am in this airport which is every few months I will not go here to eat    Best part was the pic I took of the food looked nice.",

My son ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and there was no buffalo sauce in the wrap- just too much lettuce, ranch and blue cheese with a  few small chunks of chicken.

The service sucks and after waiting 15 minutes for the waitress to take out order 30 minutes later the food came out and mine wasn't even close to what I ordered. Then the waitress acted like it was an imposition to get the correct order. I will not stop in here again. This was my second try here and both times were bad. As someone who goes through CLT every week I don't recommend eating here.",

Only come here if you are going to sit at the bar and has at LEAST 1 and a half hours. It will take your server around 30 minutes to come greet you and another 30 minutes for your food to come. The food is not good, way different than the original outside of the airport. I am not sure why these restaurants still risk their business by allowing HMS Host to operate their reputable businesses. I will not come back here and encourage others to do the same.",

The BBQ pork (sandwich), the pork tastes freshly smoked and not like it has ever been frozen. The quality of the food seems to be higher than your average airport food, which is always a nice treat! The service is always prompt and friendly.   As others stated, our server asked our flight information to make sure that we were not rushed or that we were waiting on them to catch our flight. I tried some chicken tenders, and they definitely did not taste like they were ever frozen, and that the breading was fresh.  The only downside to this place is the location - I wish it was closer to the main area of the airport!",

You got out of that airport/traveling mindset for a bit and are able to relax which was nice given that I had a middle seat on the prior flight. Blah!   We opted for Dirty Tots because the lady next to us had a half eaten burger and while it looked delicious AND huge, we thought we'd be in a coma after eating that. Pfft!  Coma came after the tots!  They were delicious!  Like, ridiculously delicious!  Tater tots are odd...it's hard to toss goodies on top and keep the tots under crispy but Whisky River figured out the trick. It certainly satisfied us and we were ready to settle into our next flight and just veg out!    The beer I had, a local stout that I wished I'd remembered the name but it was delicious!

So in the context of a normal city food scene, this would be a 1 star review all day. But since I have skeptical expectation when dining in an airport, this experience falls as a-ok in my book. As with so many reviews and especially when it comes to airports... location, location, location. This was the only sit down restaurant anywhere close to my gate. So despite my desire to separate from Alabama stereotypes and going against all things NASCAR, I end up in Dale Jr's restaurant. Despite what you may already thing, I had no idea it was DJ's until I was in there. But I digress.  I was hungry enough to eat. But not hungry enough to order a whole bunch. Which is a good thing for them. I ordered the appetizer of chicken fingers for $11.59. To which I got obviously frozen chicken fingers... in a quantity of 3 fingers total. With twin one year olds, I know this cost them a total of $1.42 with an extra $.50 to fry them in who knows how old oil. The service was good and the beer was cold... that is about all they had going for this place.",

    "text": "For an airport bar this one isn't bad! At the top of Terminal E at CLT, they have a big bar and plenty of seating. The bar tenders are funny and so nice. Makes for a pleasant place to kill time before your flight.   They have and offering of morning cocktails - complete with a Bloody Mary (vodka or Moonshine) that looks amaze! I had a mimosa (hold the OJ ), but was impressed when I saw the bloodys come out. I also hear lots of yummy noises from People having them.   Worth noting this is a whisky bar so they have quite an assortment. It's 10:30am as I write this so I didn't partake - but no judgement to anyone who is, does or would! I just prefer my OJ-less mimosas as a breakfast drink!   Breakfast goes until 10. Insider tip: the bar tender made a guy near me aware that since they fry eggs all day a bacon, egg and cheese is always available!  He got it and it looked killer.   Overall it's a solid stop for an airport bar!",

    "text": "\"Whiskey river, take my mind Don't let her memory torture me Whiskey river, don't run dry You're all I got, take care of me\"  I was recently traveling and had a 44 minute layover in CLT, but my first leg from CHS was late and after running across CLT to my gate I was denied permission to get on my flight from CLT to TYS, and had to rebook a flight that was 6 hours later. So there I am stuck in CLT for 6 hours with nothing to really do, so I decide to go grab a drink at Whiskey River and do a little work.  I went in and sat down at the bar where I opened my laptop with good intentions. But after being a good boy for about an hour i started ordering more drinks; which turned into even more drinks. Whiskey River really took my mind during this longer than expected layover.  Well the beer selection was minimal, but they also have a full bar. Food is decent for an airport, but it is expensive and the kitchen is slow. Service is great here. Everyone is very friendly and great conversationalists.",

He was very polite and attentive, but didn't hover. They even have live music in there on certain days, which is cool. I had the buffalo shrimp and it was pretty good. The sauce had nice flavor. the shrimp were similar to butterfly. The beer was perfectly cold and right on time. We had beer and a couple of cocktails. Reasonably priced and a nice atmosphere. Bar was huge with plenty of seating...best of all...they had charging ports at the bar. Whenever I'm in the Charlotte airport again I'll be back.",

    "text": "I had a layover at the Charlotte airport and decided to get some food. This place, located in Terminal E, wasn't far from my gate so I decided to give it a try. From the outside, it somewhat reminded me of the bar on the old TV show, \"Cheers.\" There were plenty of seats around the full, large bar. The bar was pretty decent in size and restaurant had a host stand right at the entrance where you were greeted upon entry an taken to a seat. It was pretty crowded and I don't believe there was a wait but since I was alone, I decided to take a seat at the bar. This was about 830pm.   SERVICE: The bartender was an older Caucasian looking woman; short in stature. She was pleasant, timely and efficient. I asked about 3 different whiskey drinks and one of them she didn't recommend because it came in a souvenir glass and she said it was quite costly. Thus, I opted for one of the others selected. I noticed there were no prices on the menu. I didn't want to be \"that customer\" who says, \"Ummmm, how much is this?\" Also, I expected to pay a bit more because I was at the airport so I didn't bother to ask. The bartender checked on me as needed, my food came out in a timely manner and as soon as I was ready to check out, the bartender gave it to me in a timely fashion.  FOOD: I ordered the brisket grilled cheese with broccoli. It was great! Very flavorful and filling. The bread was perfectly toasted, not soggy like some places and the portion size was appropriate. The broccoli was \"al dente\"...just the way I like it.   Now on to my complaint.......I did NOT expect to pay $15 for a whiskey drink (that was not hand crafted) that was served in a basic highball glass. I mean...didn't I say above that she recommended me NOT to get the some in the souvenir glass because it was \"expensive.\" Well....\"I\" think $15 is pretty expensive.....or maybe that's just me. So after having ordered two of those, I was stunned. But what was I supposed to do aside from pay for it? I mean, my glass was empty. With all of that being said, I definitely think it can be viewed as somewhat of a rip off due to the fact that many travelers want alcohol and no prices are on the menu. I would return; but I would drink water instead. Tap water that is... no bottled water.",

Okay the atmosphere is country with blues. Cool seats with faux cow hide backs. I hope they are fake! There is a small stage for entertainment. I guess if you flight is delayed this could be great. We just missed the Live music because guys was taking his black bag and leaving. The music they pipe thru heir system Is loud if you don't want to talk to someone, come here Check out the belt buckle walk. That's a nice distraction why waiting for your food which takes a while. Hopefully you won't be seated in the back by the whiskey barrel wallpaper because all you have to distract yourself with is people or free internet like me. Okay the menu is general American fare. We tried the chicken burger with bleu cheese crumbles. Ugh! The flavor on the chicken breast was too salty and not what I anticipated. the fries were okay. Overall, is it better than other airport food? No. I advise you to walk to different terminal and try something else. Not worth it",

The bacon was something you get out of those pre-cooked boxes. Not tasty at all. The biscuit was served dry with packaged jelly on the side.

Bartender was Milady, she told me I could not hold a seat for my friend who was coming from a different gate and plane. I had already ordered our food. I was only drinking water and happened to be the only female at the bar so it felt as if she was a stripper working a bar for tips and not for Customer satisfaction.  So if you want somewhere to eat good food listen to good music and relax between your flights go somewhere else. You will feel more warmth sitting next to the TSA AGENTS.  Food was good music was good, seriously don't sit at the bar. If it's the only place open and youve had all the customer service you can handle I suggest you sit at a table.   If you've had all the good service and pleasant personalities you can take in your travels and want to feel abused, unwanted and like your in a mean gurl scene sit at the bar.",

The service was fast, efficient, and friendly. We had the dirty tots. Worth every calorie! We also had the Buffalo chicken wrap. It could have been wrapped better, but it was spicy, definitely had bleu cheese on it, but also came with cucumbers. I didn't care for that either. We were there at 11 on a Sunday, were in, ate, and out within 40 minutes. If alcohol would have been served, we would have stayed much longer.  I'd say overall enjoyable experience.",

I waited 10 minutes for a waiter to approach me. He did and took my drink order. Showed back up to take my food order. I asked for a Cobb salad with ranch. Response was that they didn't have salads or sandwiches. Bewildered, I asked why. \"Our kitchen staff.\" Told me I could order quesadillas or burgers. Some entrees, mashed potatoes. One would have thought to mention that to me when he took my drink order! I order my second choice of a quesadilla. It shows up, with barely any filling, which consists of a few pieces of corn, scattered black beans, tons of onions, mushrooms and scant cheese. I stopped the waiter and asked where the chicken was, as it said grilled chicken quesadilla on menu. Response? \"You didn't ask for it. Don't think we have it anyway.\" Usually if something comes with a choice of filling the person taking the order will prompt the customer. I pointed out the random french fry I found in it. Waiter could care less. Laughed it off and walked away without offering to take it back and fix it. No manager on duty it seems. I will never come back here.",

But, we're talking airport food here so I guess we should set the bar low. Really low. Definitely wouldn't order again. $19.99. I should've stuck with a cheeseburger I guess. Next time. Also, glass of wine = $12.75 for a normal size (9oz) and this is the cheapest on the menu. They offer a 6oz for less but, really? I've never even heard of a \"six ounce pour\". WTH??",

The beer was good and we were happy with the draft choices. Once we received our food, the waitress was gone before I could question my salad dressing (it was supposed to be a honey bourbon \"ranch\" but appeared / tasted like honey mustard).

Quesadillas are good, but not worth $13, even with chicken and guac added.  But the service from Matt is AMAZING. He is attentive and quick, which is not an easy task in this extremely busy spot. Still, you feel like your tab is the only cover he's serving. SO GOOD.  Try to sit at the bar facing the rotunda outward from the actual restaurant, as far from the live music as possible. It's just annoying if you're too close. The musicians are fine, but super loud. Besides, the bar has power outlets underneath that you can exploit. #protip",

The \"cocktails\" look better on the menu compared to their taste.   I ordered a Shrimp wrap Cilantro-like based with Parmesan fries and i can say probably The food in the carts at the terminals was better. The fries were re-heated and the Parmesan was bad quality, the ketchup wasn't even making them taste better. The wrap was very cold, not even slightly cold. For my taste, I would have preferred it a little warm. So basically I ate the inside and there were like 3 shrimps. Kind of pricey for what I got.

Another 30 min later food came but not correct. Also burger nearly raw inside. No time to fuss, we just ate what we had. Everyone makes mistakes but I was very disappointed that except for a quick \"sorry\" no offer of compensation was made.  Should have at least offered to comp the drinks or something. Will not come again.",

The beer selection is great lots of local NC beers! The food is meh. Everything is priced as you would imagine being at the airport but it's not very good. My nachos were drenched so bad in cheese that you could even pick up a chip.. Kinda like a nacho soup. It was gross and I ended up with a salad that was fine.",

When finally seated,  the waitress was very nice. I ordered a burger, and it was just OK. The fries were not very good. Kind of soggy and had no flavor. Absolutely nothing to rave about. On subsequent layovers there has been a band playing, and the place is totally packed. I don't think it's because of the food, But if you have hours to kill you might as well go listen to the band. This place was just OK, and I probably would not go back.",

There also isn't really that much room to put your bags or carry-ons down.  Once we were seated, a server came by a few minutes later. I really think she might have been one of two people serving the whole place. Trying her best to keep up with the demand, she brought our drinks back quickly and took our order. We waited around 15 minutes for a cobb salad and buffalo chicken wrap. The cobb salad was huge and packed with a ton of toppings, just how I like it. I got asked by many people waiting in line for the adjacent pizza place if it was as good as it looked, yes, yes it was. My husband said the chicken wrap was decent.   The only problem we had was getting refills on our drinks and the check, both took a little longer than wanted.",

She took too long. Had to suffer through terrible blaring country music. Buffalo chicken omelette was ok. Tasted like buffalo sauce and blue cheese. Hard to screw up. Wife's biscuits and gravy were gross.  Biscuits were weirdly sweet and soggy even in places that hadn't touched gravy (undercooked?).  After struggling to get service through our meal, when the check came the waitress now had nothing better to do than chat at us for about 10 min. We were obviously tired and uninterested in conversation. Fortunately (or unfortunately) we weren't rushing to a flight.",

The decor is very nice and the ideas seem fancy, but the food (in my case, a burger - there isn't much that you wouldn't find at any pub) and drink (Mountain Dew and whiskey do not a cocktail make) were somewhat underwhelming.  Given the rather hefty price of food here, I definitely can't recommend it.  The servers were incredibly nice, though, which I appreciated.",

Menu is interesting. Ordered the \"low country poutine.\"  One would think that an item with  \" low country\" in the title might have shrimp, crawfish something like this but no. It was steak-based with a whiskey inspired sauce over French fries. Lots of cheese that was either microwaved or oven-baked. Difficult to cut, so I asked for a knife. Was told they only had forks. What??? Is this prison??   Steak was tough and cut into such large pieces that I passed on the steak.   Hence the 2 stars.",
