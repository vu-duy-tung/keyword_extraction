I ended up splitting the big boy plate (I forget the actual name) with my girlfriend.  All the BBQ on the plate was delicious although I thought the chicken BBQ was a bit too dry.  That's a hard one to keep from drying out though.  The pulled pork was good and moist.  The interior is a little dated but I'm doubtful any of the patrons of this place really care.  It's got a pretty cool neighborhood feel.  The service was great and friendly.  Bottom line is, there are so many great choices for BBQ in Charlotte, this place is easy to overlook.  It just didn't stand out to me.",

I had the buffalo chicken sandwich. I didn't realize it was going to be hot (spicy) but I didn't mind. The ranch that came with it was perfect. Husband had the pork sandwich. Amazing. I want to go back.",

    "text": "There's a certain crowd in Charlotte that believe that Mac's is the end-all and be-all when it comes to barbecue.  And that's okay, because while they're cramming themselves into Mac's, I can hang out at McKoy's (so far as I know, there is no relation).  McKoy's is a small place, tucked into a corner on Woodlawn at Old Pineville, where at least two or three places have been since I've been in Charlotte, and if memory serves, McKoy's has been there longer than anything else.  This incarnation is something of an upscale biker bar.  But what they really have is good barbecue.  Not that other food isn't good, but the 'cue is top-notch.  What you need to do, however, is catch them when it is freshest.  Though lunch and dinner can get a bit busy, it's the time to go, because if the meat has been sitting a while, it can dry out, and at that point, it's only as good as Mac's.  That's not bad, it's just not the best  When it's fresh, however, it is as good as it gets - even without the need for sauce (though they have a good vinegar, and I don't even like vinegar).  Also make sure you try their macaroni and cheese, which along with their sweet potato fries are quite possibly the best in town.  The only downside is that it can get a bit smoky inside (no longer a problem now that you can't smoke inside!).  They have a small porch out front, but it's right on Old Pineville - so there is some downside.  Otherwise?  McKoy's rocks.",

Our server was Great, in fact, all of their employees were cheerful & helpful, almost like they were each a part owner of the establishment.  The smoked meats were very tasty and so was the Guinness.  Just across the street from the LINX Train / Public Transportation to and from downtown.

The only thing missing was the hush puppies.  Nice vibe... part corner bar and part BBQ joint, great prices.

    "text": "I got the LTD and a side of wings. The wings had a great smoky flavor which was masked by an excess of sauce. The sauce was great, but I felt the wings would've been better served with less of it.  The LTD must stand for \"Leaves Tons (to be) Desired.\" The plate comes with two sides, roast, BBQ chicken, puled pork, and ribs.  The plate is freaking massive. It's a LOT of food. They pile it high with roast and pulled pork, give you four ribs, and 1/4 chicken (wing + breast).  The chicken wing was great, but the breast was VERY dry.  The roast was sawdust dry. I had a bite with a bit of onion which was presumably stewed down with the roast, and it wasn't half bad because the onion was moist enough to mask the uncomfortably dry roast.  The pulled pork was fair, but also a bit drier than I would've expected.  The ribs and sides were the highlight of the dish. The four ribs were packed with meat, and had a wonderful texture. I would've preferred a far more smoky flavor, but they were still good. They were also slathered with a decent BBQ sauce (more on this later).   I got mac n' cheese (because the Yelp reviews praised it) and fried okra. I expected a bit more of the mac n' cheese. It's not that it isn't good mac n' cheese. It's above average, but not great.  The fried okra was pretty good, but it was a touch too greasy, and a touch too salty. If it had more crunch on the outside and less grease, then it would've been perfect.  So... 3 items on the LTD were too damned dry to enjoy without some sauce, and that's a shame because the sauce on the tables is, for lack of a better word, terrible. One is a smoky shade away from ketchup and the other is of a heavy vinegar base. The vinegar one wasn't bad. At the recommendation of one Yelper's previous review, I mixed the two together and had a halfway decent sauce on my hands. No idea why no one in the restaurant has put this together.  The wait staff was prompt, attentive, and friendly. Can't ask for more on that front. Maybe I caught them on an off night, but when I go back, it'll be for wings and ribs. I'm not interested in trying the roast/pulled pork again.",

    "text": "I drive by this place all the time because it's on my way to Costco and on one of my alternate routes to/from work.  I often wondered about some of the places along my way on Old Pineville Rd like McCoy's.   After reading some of the other reviews on Yelp and also getting a flyer on my door at home, I decided it was definitely time to check it out.  McCoy's is a relatively small place but they make use of every inch of space with plenty of tables even if they might be a little close together.  There is also a bar with about 10-12 seats, TVs scattered around and a few video games back in the corner.  They also have a covered patio out front for additional seating.  There is a very extensive menu for such a small place - everything from sandwiches, salads, to steaks, ribs and barbecue.  I ordered the pork barbecue plate with collards and suateed mushrooms.  In about 10 minutes the meal was out.  The pork stands on its own which is hard to find at a barbecue place in Charlotte.  You don't need any sauce on McCoy's pork 'cue.  It's very moist, tender and flavorful and probably the best barbecue I've had in Charlotte for a long time.  Yes, It's better than Mac's IMO...and cheaper.   I will say that I tried both the sauces, an eastern NC and a western NC style sauce and I wasn't really impressed with either of them  which is fine because like I said, the meat is fine by itself.  Who needs sauce!  For sides, the mushrooms were great and the collards were good also.  They came with a homemade pepper vinegar rather than the standard Texas Pete stuff which was a nice touch!    Service-wise is where I think they can improve on.  The hostess didn't really greet me.  She just showed up when I entered the place and sat me at a table without really saying anything.  My server kind of started out the same way but got better as I sat there and did come to check up on me and refill my drink.  Overall, McCoy's is great and I think I just found my new favorite BBQ joint in Charlotte.",

I got what I thought would be their signature dish, the pulled pork sandwich with the slaw and baked mac n cheese. A bit messy as expected and is part of the bbq experience. Perfect baked mac n cheese and really good Cole slaw. The pulled pork came with a little bit of bbq sauce and they provided me with a bottle of bbq sauce so I could add more to my liking. I would rather have it served to me like that every time than it being smothered. The rest of my family all enjoyed their food too. Some dishes were a bit overwhelming to a couple people but that was there fault because I warned them of the portion size of the LTD. Overall very great dinner experience that I will not forget.",

The service is good, the ambiance is what you'd expect - rowdy and catered to the sports fans. Not a problem. The food, however, is not what it should be.   I got a $25 ribeye. Now let me start off by telling you, I'm a  fat girl and steak connoisseur. I know what a good steak is. This was an excellent cut of steak. They just cooked it horribly. I ordered it medium rare, as any True steak eater should, but what I got ran the gamut between well and rare. Every bite was a mystery, and not in the good way. Plus, they threw on some gross herbed butter (I taste NO garlic) but ABSOLUTELY NO SEASONING WHATSOEVER. I'm sorry, but steaks MUST be salted while cooking to bring out the natural flavor. This was not. Oh, and my \"sauteed  mushrooms\"... ew. Mushrooms should not taste like some weird tomatoey onion amalgamation. I think their garlic might have been old or something.   Also, my husband's ribs were undercooked and the sauce tasted like it was out of a jar from the local Food Lion. No beuno. I don't know what \"St. Louis\" these people have been to, but the only one I know has better seasoning than that. The ONLY good thing was the side salad. It was actually decent, which tricked us into thinking we were getting a good meal. Damn them. 10/10 would not recommend. The only reason this got two stars instead of one was because of the salad and the service.   And it's Christmas and I'm feeling charitable.",

If you are in the Charlotte area 10-15 minutes from the airport please stop in.... they have a whiskey,... clyde Maze is super duper smooth. Get in a whiskey sour or straight, unbelievable. Knock your socks off good.. okra was good. The string beans are better...stop by. Great service from Caroline.",

Glad there was a healthier choice than just mac and cheese or grits.    Service was attentive and courteous.  Multiple people looked after us...I prefer that over one waiter or waitress.  So why not 5 stars?   I don't want to mislead you...this is not fine dining.  A \"yankee\" might feel out of his or her element here.  I was fine because I was with locals.  Insider tip: go early, even on a weeknight.  I got a table no problem at 6 on a Tues, but by 6:30 the place was jam packed!",

The Mac & Cheese was loaded with real cheese, not the processed \"Kraft\" kind of cheese. The potato salad was fresh & homemade - you could be the texture. They offer two sauces - a sweet tomato based and a \"vinegary\" flavor. Here's a tip - try combining the two! It's a five star restaurant with a four star ambiance.",

The only downfall was that the food took a bit long to come out. We had a lovely waitress that informed us the kitchen was backed up but she kept coming back and letting us know it was coming. My sister and I shared the meat platter sampler which was more than enough for the two of us. I would definitely come back and would love to sample more of the sides. The spicy pinto beans are not spicy at all, no kick whatsoever. As an appetizer we did order the smokehouse wings, double grilled, so there was a nice chat just the way I like them. If I wasn't with my family who doesn't enjoy spicy food I would've tried a different flavor besides barbecue. My brother ordered the fried chicken and that looked good as well, two large breast and he didn't even finish one!",

You get your money's worth.....  * Fantastic TEMPURA BATTERED ONION RINGS - don't miss these. These are far and away the best onion rings that I have ever eaten. These onion rings, by themselves, are worth the trip here.  * BARBECUED WINGS that will put a smile on your face.  * Superb MAC 'N CHEESE and COLLARD GREENS. Pepper vinegar is available for the greens. Add this and some salt to the collards and thank me later.  SERVICE - 5 stars: * My waitress was first rate, highly attentive, helpful, and friendly. She got a BIG tip!    * VERY easy to find: Easy access from 1-77, Exit 6A. * Plentiful parking. * Gorgeous bartenders. Strong drinks. Bartenders also provide fast drink service.  * Extremely laid back atmosphere, with plenty of TV tuned to sports.  * I don't much think that this is a good place for children, after all, it's still a bar. Parents, use a little common sense.  * PS: The booth's seat cushions needed some TLC, but in the grand scheme of things, that's not very important to me. The food was so delicious, that such trivial things didn't matter. This is a great sports bar/restaurant.",

Two choices, basically a straight up watery vinegar (I get it - that's the Carolina way) but the other is basically a ketchup. The other thing I wasn't crazy about as I sat at the bar, 2 of the 3 TVs were on a channel that is notorious for spreading hate. Just a heads up of the kind of atmosphere you're heading into. Also, I should mention I went there two days in a row bc I was on a business trip staying at the hotel around the corner..  next time, I'll see if I can find a place that doesn't shove political BS down my throat as I eat mediocre BBQ sauce.  There has got to be a much better place in that same area to have a meal ...  save your hard earned money from this place.",

    "text": "TL;DR get the chicken wings!!!! pot roast, fried squash, and mac & cheese are p awesome too  Had a long layover in Charlotte and decided to checkout this place! We ordered a chicken wing app (6 pc w/ Thai chili sauce) as well as the LTD, southern fried chicken, and a Caesar salad. This was WAYYY too much food for 3 people lol...just the LTD alone could've filled up our whole party plus some.   Let me just say that the chicken wings are out of this world! Incredibly juicy and charred, and the Thai chili sauce that our waitress recommended added a real nice kick to it. If I ever came back here I would defs order this chicken wing appetizer as my meal!!   We had a hard time deciding which meats to try, so we ordered the LTD to sample a bit of everything. The pot roast ended up being the real star of this dish (the meat just melts in your mouth!), with the other meats being a bit on the drier side. Also had sides of fried squash and spicy pinto beans with this meal -- the beans were really nothing special but the fried squash was super addicting and super crispy!   My sister was dying to try the fried chicken so of course we had to order that as well loll. The breading is really well seasoned but besides that this dish didn't really stand out. She also ordered a side of mac & cheese which was perfectlyyy gooey/creamy/cheesey and probably the highlight of this meal for me haha. The sauteed green beans (which tbh tasted more like they were steamed :/) were just okk.   Overall I would say this place is a 3.5/5 for food, but I bumped my rating up to 4 because of the great service and great value (HUUGE dishes for decent prices).",

And although I wouldn't go that far, I would say it was some of the best Mac n cheese I've had in my life.  In fact, a colleague of mine who joined me for lunch ended up going back the next day and ordered a meal entirely of Mac n cheese.  So we definitely enjoyed ourselves.

After a slightly hellish 6 am flight and no food in my belly, McKoy's Smokehouse appeared on my Yelp search while a choir of angels sang in the background (in my brain, at least). I made the short stroll from my airport hotel and was greeted by the friendliest host who called me \"darlin\" and \"sugar.\" I'm not sure how I'd react to someone calling me sugar in Colorado, but here I found it endearingly Southern.   I ordered the BBQ pork platter off of the \"vittles\" menu, which comes with two \"fixins\"--I ordered the collard greens and fried okra. I was pretty hungry and went HAM on that pork (get it?), but in all honestly this plate could probably feed a small family. I love North Carolina style BBQ and the super vinegary sauces that come with it, and theirs certainly did not disappoint. The okra was really crispy and collards were perfectly seasoned and not too soggy. For $12, this meal a total steal.  This spot was pretty quiet and tame on a Friday afternoon, but I imagine it gets rowdier during the evening (it is a biker bar, after all). My server, the host, and one of the cooks all came out during my meal to make sure everything was okay--talk about service. McKoy's, thanks for filling me up with pork and assuring me that everything's going to be okay after air travel. I love you.",

    "text": "Back in the days where I didn't write reviews on Yelp... I've been here, however I never came back after. Let's just start with the obvious... It's not well known and you won't know it's really there unless you really take a good look. Inside you'll find straight up a bar. Some super old timer bar. You'll probably be blasted back to the west when you see the inside. But, it literally is just a straight up bar. Seating is super old, like the booth that we initially sat on felt like it was about to break. We opted for the table instead.  So this is what we ordered:  St. Louis Full Rack of Ribs and Living the dream.  These two things fed the 4 of us contently. We also ordered the greens as well as fried okra and green beans. To us though, the greens, even though they were cooked in pork stock, was sweet! What?! Why?! I felt that they added sugar within the greens, which completely turned our appetites off for the greens. The mushrooms and the fried okra were okay.  The St. Louis Full Rack of Ribs was a winner to us, as well as the pot roast. The pot roast was fatty, the way we like it, but we should have had more. That was the sad thing about our order, that living the dream didn't provide as much of pot roast as it did with the pulled pork and chicken. The pulled pork and chicken, well, it was dry. I've definitely have had better before, but it wasn't bad with it drenched in sauce. But, to be honest it comes out pretty dry.   If you want to take my cents and you're unsure of what to order... I would recommend you to get the ribs or the pot roast. You won't go wrong there, at least for our taste. The service was good, and there wasn't much else to say. Stick to the chairs, ribs, and pot roast and you'll win here.",

For my main, I chose the half barbecue chicken. A good amount of sauce on this bird kept it moist and the meat tore off easily with a well wielded knife and fork. The potato salad was excellent, mixed through with egg. The mac & cheese was also very good with a firm consistency that was more noodles than cheese. Tasty. A very good portion of chicken and sides.  Definitely will return. Maybe I won't wait five years next time...",

Creamy with a lot of crispy, melty cheese on top! Collard greens were good.  Perfectly cooked and I liked the seasoning they used. I got a bun for $1 and now have a large lunch for tomorrow.   The owner was around and seemed to know a lot of people.  Very friendly guy.  My waitress, Sunny, was very attentive and bubbly.  She has an appropriate name.",

    "text": "Horrible Experience Mr. Manager   Party of three (my family) and we ordered the following: Wife - Ribs half rack with greens and mac n'cheese Son - Cheeseburger plain with fries  Me - 12 Double smoked wings (calypso & chili) and side of pasta salad.   ISSUES: Wife's ribs were overcooked and tough as nails. The greens filled with stems versus the preferred \"leafy\" portion. The mac n'cheese was edible.   Son's burger was satisfying to him but not much expectations for a 12yr. old.   My wings were beyond charred. I understand double grilled because I'm a self proclaimed expert backyard/outdoor kitchen griller myself. But I told the waitress explicitly that as long as the wings aren't burned whereas I can taste the char then I'm ok with the double grilling. She said no problem but then brought out a problem with burned wings.   Not to mention I couldn't order all flats. I understand they're pre-packaged from the supplier and to order one specific portion over the other would throw off the overall count. All you have to do for people like myself who want specific flats or drummies is to charge us a little extra for that convenience. You never want the customer to feel their request is something far beyond your capabilities when it actually is a basic one.   Every other restaurant will allow you to pick your pieces but will simply charge you a buck or two more for the request.   My pasta salad never made it to the table BUT it made it to the actual bill?  Go figure. I told the waitress and she of course took it off but how can it not make it to the table but find its way to the bill?  This was a total waste of $50 I have to be honest. Please feel free to contact me if you want to make it right. The last complaint I've made to a restaurant (and I travel a lot for work) was in 2009 because I'm not the complaining type. This was an exception due to it being such a poorly prepared meal with a forgotten side item that was attempted to be charged.",

When the waitress set silverware down I told her it was for takeout per email which did not mention dine in only. Did not skip a beat, verified with manager & sent me home with a delicious, tender Steak with mushrooms, mashed taters & veggies. I will be stopping here for supper both sit down & takeout many more times. The employees are nice, friendly & welcoming to a new Charlotte resident. The food is fresh & homemade.

Despite being pretty busy at 6:30 pm on a Monday (I hear it gets way busier later), the service was very fast and very friendly.  And if the biker bar label scares you a bit, let me tell you that the clientele are every bit as friendly as the staff.  As for the food, I ordered McKoy's Barbecue Sandwich (pulled pork and cole slaw on a roll with a side).  The pulled pork was so juicy that the roll pretty much melted in my hands!  For my side I ordered the mac and cheese, and it may be the best Mac and cheese I ever had!  They also have a lot of cool events like live music and Biker Night every Friday.  Tonight they had a cornhole tournament.  If I ever make it back to Charlotte, this place will be first on the list of places to go!",

We had the large BBQ platter, a good value.  The sides were normal portions, but accompanied by a huge pile of pork - plenty for the take-home box.  They allow you to sauce it yourself, choosing between traditional NC vinegar or a tomato-based sauce.  I recommend the vinegar, personally since it's NC.  Greatly enjoyed the visit.",

Which is unheard of for me... I got side of mac n cheese, I do wish it was hotter and less greasy.. but it's still unique and really F***ing good... I also got 12 (proclame?) wings... the are amazing, fall off the bone, juicy, different... and the carrots & celery that comes with it, I got ranch.. the ranch is soooooooo good.. seems homemade.. a little chunky.  I will be back.. ask for Bri.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to McKoys Smokehouse & Saloon located right off of I-77 in south Charlotte, NC.   This smokehouse, with both indoor and outdoor seating, reminds me of what a local BBQ joint should look like with wood interior, BBQ paraphernalia on the wall, and loads of TV's.  We chose to share the Living the Dream (LTD) platter, a combination of ribs, pork, pot roast, and smoked BBQ chicken with sides of mac n' cheese and fried okra. The St. Louis style ribs were great, not fall off the bone as most BBQ restaurants serve, but with a little pull after the bite like KCBS competition ribs. The smoked pot roast was different, something I've never eaten.   Dora here. While we were contemplating the menu, I remember commenting that I wished they offered a combo minus the pot roast. But, no matter. I gobbled the pot roast down first! :) And look at that crusty bark on the mac & cheese! Yummy! I'm really not a fan of okra, but their crispy vegies won me over. (Sorry, no pic.) Even with two of us eating off this plate, we still brought home a leftover container with enough meat to make a pot of chili. Sa-weet! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

I read the reviews on here and since we were passing by that area, I thought this would be a good stop to catch a bite to eat.  Unfortunately, I made a mistake in judgment.  First, the place isn't in the best section of town.  In fact, I was approached by some locals asking for extra money in their parking lot.  When driving away from this establishment, it was clear it was not in a safe section of town.  Second, we waited to be seated, and then waited over 10 minutes to be recognized by the staff.  They were not over busy, open tables everywhere.  The wait staff was ample, but maybe they just were new or untrained?    When outside in the front when entering and exiting, folks were smoking directly in front of the entrance/exit.  Not the best place for a smoking section.  overall, this place can do much better with service and customers.  Location can't change, but that doesn't mean it has to take on that location with the service.",

I ordered the award winning St. Louis ribs and some mashed potatoes and the green beans.  I thought it was a little pricey for just a half rack of ribs, but I really liked the bark and the pork was tender, but a almost a little too pink for me.  The mashed potatoes were great -- I wasn't sure if they put cheese in it or if it was the potato skins in there but whatever it was, it was good.  Service was a little slow even though there were only a few tables occupied so I can only imagine what it must be like when it gets crowded here.

For example, the smoked pot roast is such a great concept, but it falls down in the execution.  They plate a giant, untrimmed portion of it, with huge bits of waste, fat, and connective tissue still attached.  Trim that thing before smoking AND again before plating, and you'd have a superstar dish that would win awards in town and inspire copycats.  It's got great flavor.  Plenty of smoke and beefy chuck goodness.  But don't make me do surgery at the table to find the edible pieces hidden among the waste.  Good sides here.  Service was so-so.  I doubt I'd come back.",

The pulled pork was very tender and I liked their BBQ sauce. For side, I really liked fried squash! Fried but not heavy! Coleslaw was good enough and mac and cheese was rich. For dessert, we had fried cheese cake with cinnamon powder and sugar frosted on the top. The cheese filling was soft and crispy outside but too sweet for me. The food was overall great.   It says the chicken will take around 20minutes to get served. You will need some patience to try great chicken. My journey to find the best chicken will go on...",

The chicken sandwich was very good! The fries I got with the sandwich were a little cold, but still not too bad.   But the pork nachos were out of this world I think! Not like regular nachos where everything is piled onto a bunch of chips but rather they made individual chips with the pork and cheese on top. Then you can add the sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce to each one!  I highly recommend here when a visit to the Queen City is in order!  I also want to give credit to my server, I gave her too much money and she returned the extra amount letting me know that I probably didn't mean to do that! I ended up giving her more of a tip!",

We get there and get seated right away. We ordered our food and it was out within maybe 10 minutes. I got the pot roast, Mac N Cheese and mashed potatoes. It was realllly good. The fresh squeezed lemonade was great as well. Wasn't too sweet, just perfect. The atmosphere of this place is cool, the server we had made sure we were okay with everything. Overall I rated this place 5 stars. I'll definitely be returning.",

We brought the kids and they even ate the pulled pork and DEVOURED the Mac and cheese!  I grab the green bean with out butter and side salad both done well and a good portion of each.

Woah! Was not expecting what I got. The food was delicious! I want some more now! lol. The salmon was grilled and seasoned to perfection. It came with the 2 lemon wedges so I used it for the salmon and a little bit for the green beans (don't judge). It didn't need any additional salt and pepper. It just needed a fork of food going into my mouth lol (see what I did there). The mac and cheese I must admit is one of the best aside from my Moms. I literally cleared the plate. I will definitely be back. I ordered take out so I can't really speak on the service. The lady who helped me (took my order, etc.) behind the bar was super sweet. Next time I'll order in.",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best BBQ places in the US. I travel a lot for work and since BBQ is a guilty pleasure of mine, I make it a point to stop by the local hot spots.   McKoy's menu offers a variety of options but not an over whelming amount that makes your head spin. My advice is to start with a small appetizer if you plan on going big with an entree because the portions are large. I started with the Good Ole Boy Queso Dip. It is large enough for two to share, but one could easily take it down. The go to entree for your first time should be the LTD (Living the Dream). It comes with good sized portions of smoked BBQ chicken, pit smoked pot roast, St. Louis ribs and BBQ pork. It also includes your choice of two sides. The Mac and cheese is definitely good enough to get as an entree if you don't eat meat and the beans are a perfect complement. Although the BBQ sauces are rich in flavor, the meats are smoked and seasoned with so much taste that it is not needed.   Long story long, if you don't take my word for it, the collection of pictures of country music stars at the entrance speaks for it self.",

    "text": "Ate dinner here while staying at a nearby hotel on a business trip to Charlotte. Enjoyed their excellent pulled pork platter with two sides (mac & cheese and fried squash). Everything was very tasty and the portions were generous. Glad I passed on the larger portion of pork, I would not have been able to finish it! Tried both BBQ sauces on the table: one thicker and more sweet - like a Midwest Chicago/KC-style - and the other a vinegar-based Carolina-style. Both were good but frankly, I ate most of the pork without sauce. It was that tasty and moist. Ironically, the only thing I didn't get from the pork was much smoke flavor. It was there, but it was very, very subtle. Nonetheless it was a very good meal.  I washed my dinner down with a Mecktoberfest, Old Mecklenburg Brewery's outstanding version of traditional Oktoberfest beer. Speaking of beer, they offer a nice variety here, both on tap and in bottles. The vibe is \"sports bar\" with lots of TVs throughout the dining room. Since I was dining alone I appreciated this since it gave me something to do while waiting for my dinner.  Finally, kudos to the staff here. The place was jumping on the Tuesday evening I was there and yet the attention from my server was excellent. She checked with me regularly and the food arrived quickly. I noticed that all the staff, servers and managers alike, were really hustling to seat and serve people.  All in all a very enjoyable experience.",

When it was 11 pm, we desperately searched the area for somewhere nearby where could get food. Luckily, McKoy's was there for us. Thank you for staying open late. For an $18 cab ride (screw that, by the way), we hopped over there and enjoyed a hell of a feast.  First of all, the service was excellent. Our server was very polite and knew the menu well. She greeted us promptly and didn't mind giving her opinion on the meals.  The food is the bomb. If you order a vittle (entree), you'll get two fixin's (appetizers) included. My girlfriend got the pit smoked pot roast with mac 'n cheese and collard greens. I got the country style steak with spicy pinto beans and collard greens. We were definitely not disappointed. I thought my steak was a bit small, but her pot roast was the bomb.  Also, the place has live music and Lagunitas on tap.",

With a mixed-bag of review and approval from the hotel front desk employee, I decided to give McKoy's a try for take-out. I will say that my food was prepared quickly as I stopped by a gas station to fill up and by the time I returned my wings were ready.  The mac n' cheese I ordered as a side was a big thin and soupy. Unfortunately the 12 wings left something to be desired; they were not bad and I appreciated the smoky flavor, but seemed no better than what I would get at a BW3's. I did appreciate the Calypso sauce (teriyaki and bbq combined).  I can't speak to the bbq and while I did like the smell of the smoker from the parking lot, I did not get the impression of an overly authentic restaurant. I've had worse meals, but in Charlotte I have certainly had better. I would characterize this place as more of a saloon and fully appreciate that late-night can reduce options.",

Unfortunately this place fell flat. They do serve large portions, it's moderately priced and the atmosphere is great. That's were it ends. BBQ is just NOT good. I had there sampler platter and everything on the platter was over cooked. I think I used half  a bottle of BBQ sauce just to get the meat down. Which  giving  credit where credit is due, the BBQ sauce they serve was very good. I am sure there are great BBQ joints in Charlotte. So look else where before going here.",

The managers checked on us several times throughout our dining experience. The waitress we had was attentive and food came out really quick. It was a bit crowded because they had a country singer artist performing. It's loud. But a great experience  The food was AMAZING!!! We ordered the wing Bar-bola (Bbq and Buffalo sauce). They were awesome, fresh and just all around great. Hubby had the shrimp and grits. I don't even like shrimp and grits combination but these were GREAT! The macaroni and cheese you could tell was definitely home made and so were the mashed potatoes. Everything is actually homemade except the French fries and fried chicken tenders. I had the pulled bbq chicken sandwich and the sandwich was huge. Hubby and I split half of each other's food but everything was so good. I didn't know what I want to eat the rest of.   All I can if you're ever in Charlotte come McKoys they really make you feel at home and comfortable! If I'm ever here again. I definitely will visit!",

The customer service was great. Lindsay was our server and did an excellent job at explaining the menu and popular items. Overall we really enjoyed the macaroni & cheese-it was amazing! Also we enjoyed the side salad. Some of us had chicken and it was okay.  Here is the bad. All of our sides (sauteed green beans/mushrooms and collard greens) were very bland. It was very disappointing. Also I ordered the pulled chicken and it came out looking like chopped chicken. Again this southern girl was disappointed.  I definitely was expecting something different. Will we return or recommend this restaurant? Unfortunately no. The food didn't taste up to par with the descriptions and price.",

I settled on McKoy's smokehouse and saloon on Monday night where I learned it is meatloaf night! The restaurant is part bar and part restaurant, with nice diverse crowd. Since I came on Meatloaf Monday, I had to order the meatloaf. I read recommendations to order the mac & cheese and the smoked wings. The smoked chicken in bbq sauce were excellent and lived up to their billing. The two sides I ordered were the collard greens and mac & cheese. Both were forgettable and bland.The meatloaf however was moist, and flavorful even without the sauce. The sauce on the meatloaf had a chunky tomato sauce on it it's reminiscent of spaghetti sauce in consistency. Bottom line:go to McKoys Smokehouse and saloon! Order the wings and meatloaf! Expect great service from the wait staff-just don't order the Mac and cheese or collard greens as sides unless you want to be disappointed.",

The food was pretty good, especially for how many BBQ places there are around here, definitely up there competing with some of the better ones around.   The only downside was the service. Either our waitress was brand new or just isn't cut out for the service industry. She pretty much messed up every order we had. Our drinks took about 15-20 minutes to get to the table and when they finally did, the beer was warm. When asking N about specials for the night, she forgot both times we asked and had to go back and ask someone. So needless to say we were there much lobbed than anticipated but it was worth it since the food was good. Hopefully she's just getting into the swing of things and it will become more natural as time goes on.   The food was a little pricey but portions were big so it balances out. I'll definitely go back soon to try some more menu items and enjoy the atmosphere!",

Because it doesn't matter if I'm full or not very hungry when I walk in the door, we're getting wings as an app. They are smoked in house, grilled, and freaking delicious. My favorite sauce is the calypso. It's a mix of terriyaki and buffalo. Finally, someone who gets me. Other places look at me strangely when I ask if it's possible to mix those two sauces together. I agree with the lovely Allyson D, I am a fan of the queso as well.   Now don't get me wrong, I'm a girl that can get down with barbecue. However, my go to here (after the wings) is a veggie plate because I am obsessed with their pasta salad. They also have some of the best mac and cheese in the city. Hi, I'm Nikki and I order the veggie plate with the most calories. The fried squash is made in house, not frozen. Green beans, collard greens, if I didn't have any self control I would probably order a six item veggie plate.   McKoy's has a cool dive and biker bar type feel to it. When the weather warms up, they do a weekly bike night. I've always had great service here. Good drink, lunch, dinner, and happy hour (food) specials throughout the week. Check out there Facebook page or website for the latest. There's also plenty of TVs (if you're into that kind of thing).",

    "text": "I've been to Coopers Old Time BBQ in Texas. Both locations. McKoys beats it. Yup, I said it. Wow! I had the Pit Smoked Pot Roast (lunch menu). Can you say Heaven? I did. Perfect. Color, texture, flavor. I opted for the Carolina sauce (vinegar based). It enhances the flavor of the meat as if that was even possible!! The sides were plentiful and delicious. I asked for the spicy pinto beans and potato salad but the star was the meat. HUGE portion (honestly we are on the road all this week so we stopped at a Flying J, bought hamburger buns and dug into the best leftover beef dinner we could've asked for later that night).   My trusty travel partner JD got the  BBQ chicken and ate all but a smidgen of it. He says it was moist, perfectly cooked and just the right smokey flavor.   Now the staff. Meh. As we walked in the hostess mumbled something and took off around the corner. JD told me \"I think she wants us to follow her\" so we did. Thank goodness she took us to a table and wasn't going on a break. She would've had two strangers hanging with her on her break. Our waitress was slow and we asked for extra napkins (which seems silly since it's a BBQ place so they should just bring extra). We never got them so we used the lemon from our iced tea and the table water to wash our hands. Hey, we make do.  So because the food was SO incredible- they get a 4.  A 5 would've been easy but the staff blew it.",

Waitresses aren't over friendly which I can't stand at most bars. They take your orders fill your drinks and don't flirt for tips. Now to the food, great taste reasonably price and something for everyone. The fried squash pulled this place from 5 star status with an overly greasy deep fry. But do not walk out without trying Mac n cheese. This place would be a great place to read my new short story. Chain Smoker.

    "text": "I decided to make this a BBQ weekend so I headed out to try McKoy's Smokehouse.  When I got out of my car I could smell smoke in the air which is usually a good sign.  The place wasn't very busy at all and I could pretty much sit anywhere.  I got the LTD (Living the Dream) which comes with pretty much all their meats plus two sided.  The meats were ribs (2-bones), BBQ pork, pit pot roast, and smoked BBQ chicken.  For the sides I got fries and slaw.  My food came out pretty quickly.  It all looked good except for the pit pot roast which had a huge chunk of fat on it.  The ribs and chicken had sauce on them, the pork and the pot roast did not.  The pork was moist and had a subtle smoky flavor.  It wasn't as tender as I like though, but it wasn't tough by any means.  The ribs weren't quite falling off the bone tender, but they very close as well.  Their flavor was OK.  The chicken also had a nice smoke flavor and tasted good.  I don't really like sauce on my BBQ, but the sauce on the ribs and chicken was light which was OK.  The pit pot roast was the best I thought.  It was moist and fall apart tender.  It had caramelized onions along with it as well.  There were two types of BBQ sauce, a tomato sauce which had a little bite to it and a vinegar sauce.  The vinegar sauce looked like it was just that.  It was way too watery so I stuck with the tomato based sauce.  It worked OK with the meat and was great to dip my fries into.  The service was good as well.  McKoy's doesn't have the best BBQ in Charlotte, but it was good.  Better than most places I have been to so far.",

First of all the owners and staff greeted and treated, us and their customers, as if they were family.  No kidding, they totally excelled at hospitality, with True sincerity, not that major chain restaurant sincerity of \"we have to do this, because corporate says so.\"  Second, when I asked the young lady, our server (sorry don't remember her name) what was good on the menu, she immediately shot out several of her favorite items and what the daily specials were.  She also asked if it was our first time to McKoy's, and quickly brought us a small sampler plate of the:  pulled pork, smoked pot roast, chicken salad, collard greens and Mac-n-cheese.  I had the Friday special, fried chicken with the fried okra and fried squash.  My girlfriend ordered the pot roast, with mashed potatoes and gravey, along with the mac-n-cheese. All the food that we had was very tasty and had I not had a hankering for fried okra, I would have had the collard greens, a dish this Northern boy never eats.  Our bill was $35, for the food, two beverages and dessert, including tax; which, I find to be reasonable now a days.  The thing that I like the most, is that the staff truly cared about their customers, and the food they produced, knowing that is what keeps people coming back. I will defiantly stop here again the next time I'm in Charlotte, NC.  Thanks McKoy's, good job.",

    "text": "I don't necessarily consider myself a BBQ snob, but I do have BBQ standards!  First let's start with the biggest qualifier... I'm a North Carolinian so BBQ=pork...beautiful smokey tender chopped piggies!  I do also enjoy other good BBQ like ribs and beef but my go to will always be pork and it will have that NC tangy vinegar sauce.  Well McKoys most definitely met qualifier number one they offer all sorts of BBQ even smoked wings, (get to those shortly).  #2, whilst walking up to your door I better get a smokey kick in the face indicating you most likely have a smoker on premises and slow cook the meat until tender and amazing..CHECK! I was met by the aroma of roasting meats before even getting out of the car.  Also menu says they use pecan wood Havant seen that much... seems to do the job well.  3rd, not a disqualifier but good sauce is highly recommended, not always necessary though if meats are prepared well enough you don't always need it.  But I do usually get a little disappointed if sauce sucks, especially if they don't have a good tangy sauce!  Be warned if the sauce sitting on your tables is bought at a grocery store you're not a real BBQ joint.  McKoys falls a little short here as they only have 2 sauces --one pretty close to ketchup, and one straight apple vinegar, after combining the two with a little kick of hot sauce it was pretty formidable so can't ding them to much on this.  A good beer selection is also always good and McKoys has a decent selection, I think I saw 7-8 taps even a few local options which is always good for bonus points from me.     To our food, first we got the sampler app...nachos, skins, wings, tenders... had a lot of people so I only got a skin a tender and a wing... tenders were premade frozen tenders deep fried, good, nothing special.  Skins were very good! But the appetizer super star was the Wings!  OMG.... SO GOOD!  Very smokey flavor most tender wings I have ever had and sauce had a good flavor but did not overpower the wing and take away from the smokey meaty flavor.  Wife informed me nachos were pretty darn good as well.   For dinner I ordered pulled pork plate...surprise! Pork was well done...well seasoned cooked low and slow, succulent, juicy, tender smokey....GREAT BBQ.  Good mixture of the \"bark\" mixed in(crispy charred exterior). Could taste it was well seasoned/prepared.   For my sides Mac and cheese and collards.  I had heard about this place just for the Mac and cheese but even the tales of Cracaroni and cheese didn't do justice to this melty cheesy concoction.  It really was best I've had in a LONG TIME.  Collards were also awesome some of the best I've had.  Wife got fried squash as a side and that was impressively good!  Lightly breaded and deep fried, dip it in ranch and you're knock in on heavens door.  Service was good too place was packed--saturday night--but good team work by the employees checking each others tables, delivering food wherever, no customer seemed unattended for long.  Cannot wait to go back...a BBQ joint that can hang with any Charlotte has to offer.  Great food, large portions, prices about average maybe a little higher but reasonable regardless!  Overall great place, thanks for the great meal McKoy's!",

Every dish was fantastic especially the smoked post roast. The chicken, ribs and roast had a nice smoky flavor. Good food, fair portions and decent service- this place is a winner!",

This has to be hands down the best meal we had in Charlotte, with some of the best food I've ever had period.  I got the pulled chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese. I consider myself a mac n cheese master and this was some of the best I've ever had. The chicken was perfectly moist and absolutely delicious. My boyfriend got the burger and fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and perfectly crispy (some of the best fries either of us have had in a long time) and he described the burger as \"a solid burger, and not a lot of places make a solid burger.\"  For dessert we got the brownie sundae, which was pretty good as far as brownie sundaes go :).  Definitely a must-try if you're in the area.",

I think you could probably even take the light rail here since it is near the tracks.  The decor is very sports-bar meets pub feeling.  There is a large bar and a big open seating area.  I had the pulled pork and it was so much food I had to take some home!  The pulled pork was probably the best I have had - right up there with Midwood Smokehouse.  Very tender and flavorful.  Didn't need sauce it was so wonderful.    The service was excellent - can't wait to go back!  Thanks guys!",

From the moment we parked our car and smelled all that deliciousness outside I just knew I was going to enjoy it. We walked in and I absolutely loved the atmosphere loved looking at all the pictures of celebrities that were there. We were waited on by Stephanie who was very very nice took our drink orders right away she was on top of everything! We ordered the nachos with pulled pork and it was a party in my mouth it was that good for our entrees my daughter had the rib eye steak with mac&cheese, my husband had the half rack bbq ribs and the meat was falling off the bone and me well I wanted a little bit of everything I had LTD Living the dream (picture added) it was big enough for two and I had mac&cheese as my side and if you love mac&cheese then you best get it cause it was beyond delish the pulled pork was my favorite with coleslaw oh makes my mouth water as I'm writing this lol.... Dessert I had fried cheesecake it was really good little too much for me but I managed to eat it but my daughter she had the coconut cream pie and OMG I'm so getting it next time ... So needless to say I'll be back!!",

    "text": "It's a Sports Bar!  A friend told me I did not want to go there and he did not want to go there.  I asked why.  He said \"It's a Sports Bar\"!  Last Friday my second lunch started at 2:30pm (got a burger for my first lunch somewhere on South that I will neither review nor go back) so I'm ready for something really good this time.  It was my first time eating at Mc Koy's and though the service was perfect and beyond and the food was Very good I will probably not come back here either only because it is not my scene (It's a Sports Bar).    Even though they had quite a crowd for 2:30 in the afternoon the food came out fast and though my wait was brief I enjoyed watching some of the Foot Ball Highlights (I'm not lying I really enjoyed it).  My waitress gave great instructions on ordering and gave me plenty of time yet still checked on me enough to make sure I was doing well (BIG Secret!  * * * She was friendly yet non-intrusive - She checked on me though did not and needed not say something every time -  She was as Professional as any wait staff at any price level - She had an intuitive gift that I appreciate in a person!  Excellent!)!    In the Kitchen (no I did not go back there) something GREAT was going on behind the scenes. As Tonya P. (P. for Poprock Photography) describes well prepared food \"Made with LOVE\"  This plate and a half was!  See Photos - This plate was piled with mmmmmmmmm Sweet Potato Fries perfectly Seasoned (and not quite typical) on the yelp scale 4.70 stars.  BBQ Sandwich (hey the bun was good but I've already had a burger 15 minutes ago so skip the bread (or half of it - told you it was good).  The Pork ...Mmmmm this is a Great Tasting (even with no sauce) Pork so I want to use a fork.  An Easy 5 yelp stars for the Pork! !  !  My waitress said both (Vinegar and Sweet Sauces) were good!  Both were VERY Good, 4.75+ stars at least!  Pasta Salad: really I only wanted a taste yet I could not stop eating it.  This is a simple almost dry Pasta Salad and probably deserves more that 4 stars.  Next Cole Slaw with much Mayonnaise (I hate Mayo and I knew that it was like this so I ordered it on the side so I could taste it, though not on my sandwich.  Even though I never eat this kind of slaw, this one is good (I took two small bites, the second was to make sure).  So why would I not want to go back?  ONLY because it's a Sports Bar (for the 53rd and last time in this review) and better stay that way because it looks to be working very well! !  !  I'm Impressed!",

They appeared to be understaffed based on the wait time. Lauren our server was pleasant but seemed a bit overwhelmed handling such a large party along with her additional tables. We arrived around 6:30 bet didn't recieve our food until after 8pm. Some of the orders were satisfactory while others were clearly left under the heating light a little too long. I give a 3 because Lauren really tried to be attentive but just had too much to handle. I noticed that once the crowd died down she was more attentive to our large party but, by that time we were done and ready for the check. I believe if our food was recieved while still hot and not luke warm the rating could have been higher but unfortunately that did not happen. I would definately recommend that the servers work more as a team to help one another out especially with a large party.",

I saw plenty of people there in casual attire and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  On to my review.....  Jennifer was my waitress last night and she was very sweet and welcoming.  I started off with an order of Buffalo Wings.  They offer different sauces to go with the wings and I picked the Buffalo Sauce.  I thought the wings were very good.  The sauce was right on point IMO.  Just enough heat to keep you honest.......  The Blue Cheese was creamy and simply great!!  They also came with sides of celery and carrots.  For my entree I had a 1/2 rack of their St. Louis style ribs with a side of mashed potatos and their green beans.  Everything was delicious!!  Ribs were big and meaty and you definitely got that smoky and sweet taste.  The green beans were sauteed in butter and garlic mixed with some chopped sweet peppers.  It was very good!!  Overall I thought this place was good and I would go back.  Only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because I think the place could use some updating but maybe it would take away some of its character if they did........ So who knows.....",

And being of the mindset that any BBQ is pretty good BBQ (generally speaking), I was only too happy to comply.   We sat on the patio, so I can't really comment in the inside, but the place was hopping and the parking lot full. From the looks of it, they do a business here ripe with regulars, and there's no question the spot was festive if not rollicking that afternoon. Beer selection, while not breathtaking, was solid, and before too long I was pulling on a Yuengling, paired this day with pulled pork (when in NC, right?), fried squash (interesting, curious), and afterward, a taste of pie that the waitress described as 'coconut and pecan pie had a kid, sort of.' And that's pretty much what it tasted like in texture and flavor.   In all, this wasn't the top 'cue I've had here, but I'd eat it again. Here's hoping there's another consumption holiday on the horizon to make that happen.",

But McKoy's is pretty delicious in its own right and is a definite barbecue competitor in Charlotte.   I didn't sit inside, so I'll just comment on the outdoor space. The porch area is really great to grab a meal with friends, have a drink and just chill. Do I wish the view was better? Sure, but hey, there's not much you can do about that! Our server was very sweet, friendly and helpful. She made sure we enjoyed our meal, our glasses were full and beers kept a-coming.   On to the food...I ordered the small barbecue platter with green beans and mac 'n cheese. Yay for two sides! The 'cue was solid - a pile plump pulled pork. My only gripe? It was on the dry side...I felt like I really had to douse on the sauce. The sides, however, were just about perfect. The mac 'n cheese was nom worthy, baked in all its goodness. And the green beans were a total surprise - fresh, crisp green beans with a very light saute in garlic and other tasty concoctions. It's a rarity that I find something fresh (not fried or saucy) at a NC bbq joint.   To wrap up the meal, I just had to order dessert after I heard about coconut pie. Yes, coconut pie. This slice of heaven was reminiscent of a mashup of pecan pie and a macaroon. It's truly swoon worthy, especially when it's warmed and topped with whipped cream. I'll go back *just* for the pie. McKoy's is definitely on my 'cue short list in Charlotte!",

My waitress made suggestions and I went with the pulled chicken sandwich, fried squash, local Pilsner and coconut pie. The pulled chick sandwich was amazing! Fried squash was much better than I expected and the homemade pie was delicious! Great restaurant. I highly recommend!",

    "text": "This review is from my mom. While the photos are of my meal and shared cornbread, she wanted me to be sure I yelped about her experience this time.  *smh* :) My mom, my boyfriend and I were driving back from a visit to TigerWorld and were in search of something yummy. Mom and my boyfriend love any cuisine that will give you cholesterol problems or require several extra steps on a Fitbit. So, as we drove down 85 to 77 on a Saturday evening, we knew not to stop in busier areas, like Concord Mills Mall. Much of the 'Food' highway signs listed fast food with a mixed in IHOP or Longhorn. However, as I almost missed the exit, I remembered McKoy's. I've visited here with work colleagues and quite liked the quality of food and portion size. So, off we went.  McKoy's has a great menu with several options for southern BBQ lovers. I like the pure protein aspect of BBQ where you can dress it how you like. Mom loves to smother stuff in sauce. As does my boyfriend, but to each their own. Mom had the pulled pork plate with a double order of fries. She was raving about how moist the BBQ was and said it even topped her local favorite. Her fries were crisp and hot, too. Definitely a success in her book and we didn't have to wait for a table. McKoys is hidden behind a few other shops/restaurants in Charlotte so if you aren't looking for it, you won't know its there. Still fairly busy but a great stop for good food that not everyone knows of.  My combo entree of pulled chicken and pulled pork was delicious, as was the Mac n Cheese. Of course, my boyfriend beat us both at clearing his plate. So, not much discussion about how good it was but I think his scarfing speaks for itself.  So, mom says 5 stars! And she will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Good stuff at McKoy's! I had the BBQ sandwich plate and everything was tasty. The Mac and cheese actually surpassed Midwood Smokehouse for best Mac n cheese in Charlotte, in my opinion! My husband really enjoyed his chicken sandwich. I ordered an additional side of fried squash because I couldn't resist, and it did not disappoint. We finished our meal by splitting a salted caramel cheesecake. Yummy, but a more accurate name would be just caramel cheesecake, as there was no salt to be found. No complaints about the service!  I have to dock McKoy's one star for allowing smoking on the patio. That's a pet peeve of mine at restaurants. Yes, I get it, people have the right to smoke if they want to. However, I would argue that non-smoking patrons' right to breathe carcinogen-free air is more important.",

I placed an order for the BBQ pork plate to go with the super sweet bartender. McKoy's seems like a cool place to eat and have a drink or two, but all I really wanted was to take a shower, get in my pajamas and eat in bed! (It's allowed at hotels. At home, not so much).  Anyway, despite all the \"research\" I did, I forgot that NC bbq sauce is vinegar based and I promptly choked and coughed up a storm from the tanginess. I started dipping a little more conservatively after that. They also give you a second, more traditional bbq sauce as well. Everything was delicious, including the mac & cheese and coleslaw. I only managed about half the plate before I gave up.   I highly recommend McKoy's and am looking forward to coming back the next time I'm in Charlotte!",

For dinner I had the pot roast, mash potatoes, and mac and cheese. Seriously, best food I've had in a long time. The pot roast was tender, the mashed potatoes were perfect, and the mac and cheese was better than what mom used to make (sorry mom). For dessert I had the peanut butter pie. It's a must try.

Try the cornbread too cause it has a little Mac and cheese type taste to it that made it great. Tea of course.  Good thing I ran in the AM.  Day two - salmon with veggies and on the side an 8 ounce portion of pulled chicken. Once again washed it down with tea and to really screw my diet up further brownie a la mode. Tea of course! All good.  Good restaurant with a good staff and nice ambiance.  May be a regular stop when I come up here.",

The ribs were slightly dry, but a taste of smoke was present. The ribs were tender, but extremely hot, which leads me to believe a microwave was used. The chicken was also somewhat dry and hardly tasted of anything but a little smoke. Nothing that a glob of bbq sauce can fix. . The bbq pot roast and pulled pork were the worst and thus unedible. No amout of bbq sauce could quench the dryness of the meat. Imagine putting in a piece of meat and all the moisture in your mouth getting sucked out!

A round of Long Island Iced teas started the meal off right. I wasn't very hungry and stuck with just an appetizer. I nearly screamed when I saw shrimp as an option on the nachos. I had to try them. Yummy! I was pleasantly surprised that for just $3 extra, every single chip had at least one medium-sized shrimp on it (yes, I pay close attention). Nachos come with sour cream, pico de Gallo and cheese. I will definitely be getting them again. And it was such a generous portion that I would order it as a meal again. I shared fries with my friend. You can select a type of salt/seasoning and a dressing. We went with seasoned salt, ranch and pepper jack. Delicious.

He also engaged our table and gave us the spiel on how the food is prepared and then brought us a sampler plate. That made our decision easier or harder depending on how you looked at it. We did not know what to chose, but by the taste of the sampler plate, knew that we could not go wrong with what ever we choose.  They are known for their wings but I went with the brisket sandwich. It was awesome. my side was the collard greens and mmmmmmm.   But I should have got the macaroni and Cheese too. It had a emphasis on the cheese. I should have also got at least on wing to try since that is what they are known for. It should almost be a crime to come here and not try the wings.   The service here was fast and very friendly. parking in the lot can get a little tight, but it is free and you should not have any problem finding a spot.  I highly recommend stopping in and paying Ryan a visit if you are looking for some great wings and barbecue. You will not be disappointed.",

They had sweet bbq sauce and a mustard or vinegar type bbq sauce. Both were really good. I really liked what I got! It was such a large portion and definitely worth the price. I find that a lot of places just don't do Mac & cheese very well, but that was not the case here. It was creamy, cheesy and flavorful. Other dishes ordered at our table were the pulled chicken sandwich, shrimp & grits, and a loaded baked potato. Everything looked really good and everyone was happy.  If I am in Charlotte again, I will definitely be back!",

The interior was a little chilly for my taste, but our server was happy to help us relocate to the patio where it was a tad warmer.  I was sad to see smokers on the patio but maybe because I live in a place where that's illegal so I'm not used to it. My dining companion had chicken fingers that were fine but nothing crazy.  The mac and cheese is another story- it was incredible! I could have eaten an entire plateful!  I had pulled pork and collards which were good too, but everything paled in comparison to that mac and cheese. We got very good advice from our server and ordered the coconut pie warmed to go and ate it back in our hotel room in our pjs. A sweet end to a sweet meal.",

We decided to do take out and eat in the car, as all of our worldly belongings were stuffed in the trunk and backseat (the neighborhood didn't look super friendly at night if you catch my drift).  Bae and I split the large pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac n cheese and an order of fries. Bud the bartender sent us a little care package with two of their BBQ sauces, one vinegar based and the other more classic style - both were so so good but my fave was the vinegar based one.  The pulled pork itself was a huge portion, super tender and moist with no fatty bits, so delicious. The toasted bun was perfectly piled high with the yummy meat and the little bit of coleslaw added a great crunch to the sandwich.  Wish I knew they had homemade peanut butter pie before we left as I would have definitely opted for a slice for the way home ;)  Would absolutely return when in the area again!",

The only meat that wasn't dry was the pulled pork, and it was average at best. I usually lick my plate clean and just couldn't get through the rest of the plate because of how dry it was. The staff was all polite and sweet, bringing me up from 2 stars to 3. I just thought the food was pretty subpar.",

I will say, the one thing that makes McKoys worth while is the deep fried cheesecake. I highly suggest getting the cheesecake, but cannot make any other recommendations. It's the kind of place my grandmother would have liked but not really my type of food. By my type of food, I mean flavorful, well thought, expertly cooked. I am not trying to be high flatulent, I dig me some comfort foods and classics, but McKoys is just average (at best). If you're in the area and don't want fast food, then head to McKoys. If you want a bar, head to McKoys. If you want really good food, drive further or get a ride and head somewhere else. Try Pinky's Westside.",

    "text": "I'm working in Charlotte this week so I turned to Yelp for gastronomical guidance. At first glance, McKoy's nothing fancy. I drove by it and didn't notice it as they're tucked in behind a gas station. The building is relatively large, but nondescript. It has a nice covered patio that is dog-friendly.   I liked this place so much I had dinner there twice this week.   The first meal was the pot roast with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy. The menu describes the pot roast is marinated. Whatever they do to it, the meat is flavorful with a hint of bbq sauce, and tender. No knife needed here. The meat was a huge chunk that accepted my fork easily. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I fell in love with the mac and cheese. Nice and cheddary (is that a word?), it is baked and has a nice crust on top. The server, Stephanie, was great and came by frequently to check on me and refill my drink. I left stuffed and happy.  Tonight, my boss was in town and she likes good food like I do, so I figured McKoy's would be a good dinner option. I was raving about the pot roast, so she decided to order it. We split a basket of the fried squash. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with more mac and cheese. My boss loved the pot roast; it was just as tender as I described. The pulled pork came with coleslaw and a toasted bun. The pork was tender and smokey. No bbq sauce for this.   The fried squash is even better cold, and it was still crisp.  Tonight's server was okay. She didn't come around much and refilled my club soda with regular water.   I asked my local employee about McKoy's and he said it was okay, but the atmosphere was fun. Really? His #2 BBQ place didn't impress me much. If I lived in Charlotte, I would definitely be visiting McKoy's often.",

Also the Mac and cheese should just be called \"cheese.\" Was a puddle of melted cheese with zero salt. Everything was just super bland.",

The atmosphere is what I would call \"tavernish\" - a few TV's and arcade games in the corner, but overall fun and friendly.  After sitting down at the bar and ordering a drink, I informed the friendly bar tender that it was my first time in the restaurant.  Shorlty after receiving my obnoxiously large bourbon on the rocks, I was presented with a free sampler platter of pulled pork, smoked chicken salad, collard greens, and mac- n-cheese, all of which was delish.  I started with the \"'maters\" (fried green tomatoes), and they were slightly above average for the South.  I then moved on to their \"award winning\" ribs - incredible.  The service here can't be beat, based on the attention I received.   My rating of this place is based in the type of establishment, and the location.  Establishments of this caliber are few and far between in areas such as this.  Don't get me wrong, this is no substitute for a night on the town in Uptown Charlotte, but on business, and not feeling like heading Uptown, this is a great place.  Full of locals as well, which is of course a good sign.  The prices are good as well.  I had my starter, entree (with two great sides), two huge bourbons, and a beer for $50 before tip.  Many great sounding entrees were under $15 as well (not the ribs), so it could have been far cheaper.",

The place was moderately packed and like another reviewer stated, one of the waitresses was hot :)   If I owned a bike and lived from around here, I will definitely come here. They have biker parking right in front and a nice patio to eat at.  We ordered:  - Pulled pork platter with Coleslaw & Collard Greens: The pulled pork was our favorite. The meat just tasted great. The coleslaw was good but nothing spectacular. I really liked the collard greens. Our waitress suggested the pork platter and she knew what she was talking about.  - Rib platter with Fried mac & cheese and Fried squash: We weren't crazy about the ribs. They were drenched in sauce and the meat wasn't as juicy as I prefer. The fried mac and cheese was AMAZING! We're on a low carb diet but that went out the window for this mac and cheese. We both loved the fried squash.  - Fried Cheesecake: Its fried and cheesecake...do you need any other explanation?!?   All in all, if we see ourselves in NC again, we'll definitely stop by.",

I decided on McKoy's since it was also billed as a saloon and I thought I'd get a good beer selection as well.  On the night I went, the beer taps were not working for some technical reason so I ordered bottled beer. I had a local brew called Rail house or something like that. It was a very good IPA and it was served good and cold.  Since it was my first time, I ordered the LTD (Living The Dream) platter which had four meats: Chicken, pulled pork, ribs, and pot roast. I got coleslaw and fried okra on the side.  The pulled pork was just so-so. It didn't have a real smoky flavor. However, everything else was fantastic. The chicken was tender, the ribs were smoky with a good dry rub, and the smoked pot roast was very good.   Also, I'm a big guy and this plate filled me up even though I did not finish the pulled pork. I'd read in previous reviews that the portions were big so I did not order an appetizer, although the wings looked very tempting.",

I also tried the pulled pork, mac and cheese, and fried okra.  The pork was fantastic, served in a huge portion and complimented perfectly by the vinegar-based sauce hidden in an unassuming ketchup dispenser-thingy.  The mac was great, as was the okra--although the portion size for the okra was far too much...leading me to put too much of it into a body that doesn't like fried food too much.  I digress.  I will most definitely come back on my next trip.  BTW--a couple of \"Crown Royal Girls\" were roaming the bar on this particular eve, offering up free trial drinks of their new apple-flavored blend.  Barf.  Why did they even bother asking me if I liked whiskey (which I do)?  This was not whiskey.  This was a sickly sweet concoction from the Willy Wonka factory that almost made me dislike apples and whiskey forever.",

    "text": "This place looks like a dive, so you know it must have great BBQ. From the diamond plate on the walls in the restroom to the mud flaps around the stalls this place oozes authentic Carolina. Outside, they have at least a dozen spots to park your motorcycle. Some kind of manufacturing plant down the street, a payday loan place, and a pawn shot ... so you know, a sort of edgy neighborhood that lends itself to authentic BBQ.  The server was perky in a laid back sort of way. We got the tater skins for an app and I had a BBQ sandwich. My wife had the fried chicken, mash potato's, and mac and cheese. We also ordered the cornbread. They even have fried cheese cake. So, we want to like this place. Unfortunately, the cornbread was cold ... I mean like it had just came out of the fridge. The mash potatos looked like the kind you get at KFC, and tasted about the same. The Mac and cheese, was lumpy, not creamy, and so it was also a looser. The fried Okra, was, well you know, the frozen stuff you get from all the places here lately ... definitely not home made. It seems that lots of restaurants seem to think that sides are just that, something on the side, and not really anything to get excited about, and so they order frozen stuff from their provider, and that is that. The BBQ was good, nice smokey flavor, and the fried chicken would have been good, but it was a bit greasy. All in all, I would have given this place two stars, but the servers really tried, it gets a 3. Another thing, the parking lot is really small, as is the dining area, and the place looks like it gets really crowded really quick.",

I doubled up on mac and cheese as my side (it's been on of THOSE weeks that require a double load of carbs to add to my double big booty) and it was delicious and creamy and cheesy as always, but I will be striking the pot roast off of my list (why didn't I stick to the BBQ?!)",

    "text": "Gotta have the NC BBQ while in town! Based on other yelpers reviews, we decided McKoy's would be the place to show us what NC was all about. We had the LTD (Living the dream) platter and ordered double mac'n'cheese as a side. Then, for some reason we thought we should also order another half rack of ribs... with slaw and collard greens on the side.  Living the Dream (which is a bit of a sample platter): The pulled pork was amazing. Especially with the slaw on top and just a bit of bbq sauce. The pit roast was also really delicious, but just a little fatty for my taste. The chicken was okay, but really paled in comparison to the pulled pork, the pit roast and the ribs. OH yahhhh... the ribs! Delish! They fell right off the bone and were so tasty. I added a little extra sauce on mine, but I am a saucy girl, after all. The mac'n'cheese was ooey gooey deliciousness...and definitely not low cal. I had to turn the plate around so that I couldn't see them anymore.  The slaw was tasty, not mayo laden at all and a great balance with crispness to the pork. The collard greens weren't my favorite, they had a weird after taste...but not being from the south, maybe I don't know what I am talking about?  We then decided to really go for a full on heart attack and ordered the fried cheesecake. Yep, I said fried.  Let me start by saying... I am pregnant and anything fried sounds delicious. Let me follow up by saying I only took two glorious life changing bites before laying my fork down. Gestational diabetes averted (hopefully.) This thing is unreal... it looks like a deep fried cannoli with cinnamon, served with a heaping scoop of vanilla bean ice cream with caramel on top. But, you really don't understand until you taste it, it has that soft cheesecakey filling that is brought to a new level by the frying. My boss, who is about to run an iron man, finished the whole thing off.... do you get what I am saying??? He's training for an ironman and couldn't resist eating it all!!!! You know it has to be good, right?  So, this place is decadent and you will leave in a food coma. But, you won't pay much and the service will be typical southern hospitality. Now that's my kind of coma!",

A few buds from work and I ventured out to grab lunch; craving some comfort food, we knew that McKoy's was our go-to spot. As a newbie, I was dubious of a great BBQ and comfort food location off the beaten path. Wrong, wrong I was! We luckily got a table really quickly, right during the high point of lunchtime. I was surprised by the mix of people that were eating.... From busy business professionals to old time buds trading war stories. I ordered the BLT wrap because well, how can you go wrong with bacon, and the mac & cheese as my side. It was fantastic! It hit the spot and exceeded my expectations. The mac & cheese was very down-home, southern style. Color me impressed and find me here the next time that I indulge for a  'cheat' meal! Very comfortable aesthetic and very unpretentious!",

    "text": "Top notch!! This place has it going on both with the food & service!! Went here last night with a few friends and had a great time. The BBQ pork platter with mac &cheese & cole slaw was awesome! The BBQ didn't even need sauce but I tried some anyways. Yum! My wife ordered their pot roast. Now, let me say this. At first she wasn't sure if she wanted to try it because it wasn't the traditional pot roast (carrots, potatoes, etc...) but they brought her a sample, yep, a sample to try. I've seen this done at bars when it comes to wine or beer, but actually sampling an entree, nicely done sir!! No brainer, she ordered it. It was so much food, we took it home & it feed both of us for dinner the next night. We tried a couple desserts too. The deep fried cheesecake was outstanding! Of course you can't go wrong with OMB's Copper on draft! We even had one of the brother's who owns the place come by a chat with us for a bit. You could tell he took pride in the food they were serving. Can't wait to go back!!!",

It would have been better if my sandwich bun wasn't stale & falling apart. Sides- Mac & Cheese and fried squash were awesome. Laid back atmosphere and good service are a plus. Patio size is decent too. Might be back if I'm in the area again.",

    "text": "I don't usually go out of my way to write a review but I just couldn't wait for this one. I wanted to make sure I remembered everything because if I could give only a half star, I would. I went there for lunch with two of my crew members. First mistake, we were waiting for a table and were forgotten about. Finally get a table and I ask for a seperate check, she gave all three of us seperate checks even though the two guys wanted theirs together. I ordered tea, the first guy I was with ordered half tea, half sweet tea, and the next guy ordered sweet tea. All three tasted exactly the same. Like very watered down sweet tea. Our glasses reached empty and stayed that way until we asked for a refill. We all ordered the Friday special, fried chicken. I ordered the shrimp chowder as one of my sides. Lots of fish, no shrimp in it.One of my friends ordered the side salad and they forgot his silverware. When we flagged down a waitress to get some, she didn't even apologies for the mistake. No matter that it's unhealthy, I love chicken skin but this one was so burnt it had that burnt crunch and burnt taste. I couldn't eat it. The chicken piece itself was unidentifiable as any piece I'm used to and so dry I had to put some of the bbq sauce they had on the table on it. The mac and cheese was good as long as it stayed hot. While fighting my chicken with a fork and knife because it was so hot, the mac and cheese cooled and got greasy. When  we got our checks all three were dumped in the middle of the table and they were all mixed up in the three black check folders. So bad we all went to Bojangles after. Should have just gone there to begin with.",

It was bigger than I expected and worth the $10.  It took about 15 minutes to get my food, but it was lunch and the grilled chicken was pretty large... bigger than the bun.  The fries where just ok.  The service at the bar was ok.  I had 1 more bite left of my sandwich by the time I was asked if it was ok.  My soda was empty before refilling.  It wasn't that busy so she could have been more attentive, but she was ok.  I will definitely be back to try another new item.",

This bbq chicken was awesome, great smokey flavor, lots of cheese no shortage there.   I had a salad as well the blue cheese dressing tasted homemade mmm  The only disappointment was no grated parm cheese for my pizza come on now you need sprinkle cheese on pizza to finish it off :)  I did order the cornbread that is what we in the south are known  for.  It was the worst cornbread I have ever eaten, it was just cornmeal n cheese but very greasey seems maybe they used  too much veg oil, my advice no veg oil, more  butter an no cheese please :) Very thin as well cornbread should be thick to me anyway.  I will def go back an try something else but I am hooked on that pizza but I guess I'll take some parm cheese to sprinkle myself :)",

They even brought us a small sampler plate of sides to let us taste their homemade goods so we could make up our minds on what to order. They were out of bbq pulled pork on a Tuesday night, so this was one of the only odd things. I'd figure a bbq joint would have that at all times. They doubled us up on their bbq pot roast, which was a huge serving. The chicken could have been a little more moist, but the ribs made up for that.  Mac N. cheese - look no further. This is the bomb. Worth a visit for sure.",

    "text": "Only went once, so take this with a grain of salt, but it was amazing. I had the ribs (half rack) and she had the pulled pork. Her pulled pork was slightly over cooked - which the guests at the table next to us assured was a real rarity - but that would be my only complaint. The ribs were superb, and the pulled pork was still really good. For sides I had the green beans and the mushrooms.  The green beans were really good, but the mushrooms were OUTSTANDING. Easily the best mushroom side I've ever had. I can't remember what her sides were but they were also really good (I think she ordered a salad for one of her sides?). Portions were perfect. Nobody should go home hungry. The big surprise of the night actually came when the group next to us recommended we try the fried squash. We were both full and I HATE squash, so we said thanks but no thanks. So they ordered us the fried squash as a surprise and I was absolutely blown away. I hate squash and I thought it was amazing. She thought the same. We wound up finishing the entire order while we were waiting for our check despite how full we were. With a beer each I think the total (incl. tax and tip) was roughly $30 a plate, but that's also with the most expensive stuff on the menu.  Highlights: The sides. The ribs were really, really good but the sides were just so good I could easily have pigged out on just them. They really made the meal. We tried some of the adjacent table's entree's and we thought the best entree ordered (out of 5 plates) were the ribs, and from what we understand that's the most consistent thing on the menu.  Hidden treat: Two here, not all that hidden. 1. Mushroom side; easily the best mushroom sautee` I've ever had, easily the highlight of the meal. If you like garlic even just a little bit, this is a MUST order every time. I know if I get the chance to go back I will be ordering the mushrooms again. 2. Fried squash; I can't explain what they did differently, but it came out crispy, salty, and just delicious. This is a must order for anyone who hasn't tried it, and I'll probably be getting that again as well.  Drawbacks: Man am I hard-pressed to find any. Parking was excellent, ambiance was excellent, service was really good, food came out quick, beer was cheap (at least compared to NYC-area prices, where I live). I guess the one thing I'd point out is that their house beer wasn't good. It was dirt cheap so it didn't bother me at all, but being that it's the house beer I feel like it needs to be said. That, to me would be the drawback. Don't order the house brew. As far as her pulled pork being over-cooked, since this appears to not be the norm I'll give it a pass, especially since it was still pretty darn good.",

I then had the pot roast that was difficult to pick up with a fork because it just fell apart so easily.  The smoked flavor in the roast was phenomenal.  We also had the baby-back ribs and half of a rack was plenty and extremely flavorful for my dining guest.  The owner came by every few minutes to make all was well.  Our server was very pleasant and service was fast.  The interior atmosphere is exactly what you would expect from a very clean, southern style smokehouse.  Istrongly recommend you stop by McKoy's.",

Had the pork plate (lunch special) w/ Sweet Potato Fries and Spicy Pintos. The meat was sweet and tender. Smoked to perfection. Didn't need a drop of sauce, but I couldn't keep away from their NC-style sauce. The sauce made the Sweet Potato fries even better, and the pintos were a unique addition.  I'll come back here every time I'm in Charlotte!",

The coleslaw was delicious, and omg the blue-cheese for the wings was out of this world.  It depends on what time of day you go whether the service is super fast or a bit slow. Even having to wait a tad was enjoyable. Either way, when we go back to Charlotte we are definitely going there again!",

I tried the barb-balo sauce and it was great. For my meal I had the smoked pot roast for something different, and it was. Huge portion. You won't leave hungry. It had a big chunk o' fat included but I think that's so it doesn't get dry during smoking. That's fine because there's no way I could have eaten it all. It was pretty tasty. Tender enough that you could hold a piece on your fork and just shake it apart! Good crowd of folks and nice friendly staff.",

Our server Stephanie greeted us and answered all our questions about portion sizes, menu items, and the beers on tap. We had the nachos with pulled pork as an appetizer. That was amazing. For dinner I had the half rack of ribs. I have no idea how anyone can eat a full but it is done often they say. My daughter had the rib eye and luckily she shared some. It melts in your mouth and very flavorful. My wife attempted the item called LTD for Living The Dream. There was so much food she barely put a dent in it. It was delicious and she is glad she has enough for lunch and dinner tomorrow. No exaggeration. When we relocate here next month, we cannot wait to make this a permanent location for us to visit. Thank you all.",

Atmosphere is good - its a bar / BBQ joint - doesn't try to be fancy and thats good - beer, BBQ, sports, etc. 2. I got the sampler that had the pork, pot roast, ribs and chicken with the mac & cheese and green beans - portion wise its enough for two people but it was the only way I could sample everything 3. Ribs were good - tender but didn't fall apart - pot roast was interesting as it first time I have ever seen that - chicken was chicken - the pork was disappointing - I have made better pork myself. I expected a lot more from a southern BBQ joint - just didn't have any flavor. 4. Sides were good, but nothing that was jaw dropping 5. Service was speedy, pleasant and friendly - that was good all around  Overall, I expected more from this place and left thinking that the ribs were the best thing I ate, but overall I was a little let down.",

    "text": "I have heard great things about McKoys but I was terribly disappointed.  The owner was really nice when we walked in and told us about all the great food.  We ordered the wings based on his recommendation.  We wanted 20, 10 plain, 10 with some kind of hot sauce they had and we got them extra crispy.  We had to pay 1.50 extra for a dozen for being extra crispy.  They came out soggy, full of sauce, and just cold and gross.   I think either the waitress just poured on sauce right before she brought them out or just forgot about them.  I also ordered the fries extra crispy for my son.  I told the waitress that the wings were soggy and she took the sauce ones but left the plain ones.  It took forever to come back out.  Also another guy brought the fries to our table and then dropped them.  He immediately brought some back out but of course they were not crispy like we had previously ordered.  My husband ordered the pulled pork, mac and cheese, and pasta salad.  He liked his meal.  The service was also terrible.  When we got our bill, they not only charged for the wings but $3.00 extra for being crispy.  We were pretty upset with that because of the fact that we had to send them back and because if it's per dozen, then why is it $3.00 for 20? Isn't a dozen 12? The waitress knew her service was terrible and even apologized for it.  This was nice of her but if she knew our experience was that bad, then I don't see why she didn't try to fix it at all while we were there.  I did really like the carrots and celery with the wings the best and the ranch was awesome.",

The fries were crisp and delicious and that pork.... did I mention the pork? The cold slaw was also spot on (I like slaw on my sandwich). Also, they offered a vinegar based Carolina sauce and a sweet BBQ sauce. I typically don't care for the vinegar based sauce but the two together tasted great.  The people in the place were also a good group. My wife and I met some great people and if I was a local I would surely make this place a hot spot. I love BBQ and I love good beer and good times. This place offers them all. If I ever come back to this area I will get the LTD as I am a huge, HUGE fan of ribs and I also want to sample that Mac & Cheese everyone raves about.

    "text": "Walking distance from the Four Points Sheridan, which was a major selling point.    Service was just OK.  The young lady tried, but it's really more of a sports bar that serves food than a BBQ restaurant.  The fella that brought out my meal really botched it by refusing to bring out a bit of ranch for my fried zucchini and just insisting over and over that it's not normally served that way.  Don't really care what normally happens; I want dipping sauce for my fried food.  The waitress intervened, practically pulling him away from the table, and bringing me a $0.50 cup of ranch.  She didn't mention that there would be an extra charge, although I figured there would be based on the dude's reaction, but fifty cents does seems a bit high for some dressing.  I was honestly happy to pay for him to go away!  Since it turned out my choice was the special for the night anyway, at a dollar off, it wasn't any kind of big deal--although I wish the specials has been more apparent than a sign on the floor by the door that you can never see again from inside the location...  I would have looked had I known!  The BBQ pork was OK.  I wish I had asked for half-pork, half-chicken, but I had figured the chicken would have been dry.  Based on how dry the pork was, it probably wouldn't have mattered.  I put on additional BBQ sauce from the squeeze container on the table, but it was a vinegar based sauce.  I had to ask for a non-vinegar based sauce and the gal just grabbed a bottle from the next table over.  Neither bottle was labeled and I'm glad I didn't accidentally find any hot sauce!  Really, the saving grace was the sides.  The mac and cheese was absolutely adequately cheesy.  The fried zucchini was totally worth skipping the sweet potato fries for.  I wish there had been an option to add a third or even fourth side to the plate--there's a sides-only option with 3 or 4 sides, but nothing with a meal.  Why is that???  In truth, I couldn't decide what I wanted my last bite to be--end on the super oily fried deliciousness of the thinly sliced summer squash in soft, soft breading?  Or save some of that chewy crusty cheese and creamy gooey elbow mac for the final chomp?  In reality, I stuffed both in my mouth simultaneously and that was indeed the perfect way to end the meal.",

    "text": "I ate 3 meals in Charlotte and this was the best by far!  I opted for a half-slab of St. Louis-style ribs with two side dishes.  Based upon the waitresses recommendation, I went with the fried squash and the green beans.  From bottom to top, here are my thoughts:  Green beans - too much garlic for my taste but I loved the freshness of the beans and that they had not been cooked to the point of mushiness.  Two bites and then I left them alone.  Bleu cheese dressing - a recommended accompaniment  for dipping  the squash and spot-on.  Perfect blend of creaminess and the slight bite of the bleu.  An appropriate amount of chunks of the stinky cheese combined with the savory flavor made this the perfect dipper for the squash.  They make this dressing in-house and it tastes like heaven.  Waitress was on the money when she recommended this as a dipper for the squash.  Fried squash - whoever thought this one up should be given a raise!  This is the first time that I've seen this dish offered anywhere but it needs to be everywhere.  The sweetness of the squash was accentuated by the crispiness of batter.  Also, the slight saltiness paired really well with the aforementioned bleu cheese dressing that my waitress recommended.  I plan to mention this dish to my favorite places that serve ribs in St. Louis in hopes that someone will pick it up and run with it.  The ribs - I love ribs!  I eat ribs in lots of different places to see how the pit masters interpret the pig differently.  These easily ranked in my top 5 favorites of all times.  They use pecan instead of hickory or a fruitwood and it makes for an amazingly complex and savory flavor.  Take a bite and your mouth waters for a second bite.  Take a second bite and the process repeats.  beautiful rub had plenty of flavor but the real star was the smoke.  There were a few different types of sauce on the table but not a one of them got within a foot of these ribs so I can't begin to comment on their attributes.  Go there - get the ribs!!!",

The greens were succulent (not bitter), mac and cheese was creamy and it melted in my mouth! The waitress was really attentive and the meal came out very quickly. The cornbread tasted like cornbread but the consistency was.... different. I will definitely be coming back here if I'm ever in the Charlotte area again!",

    "text": "The things I did to these wings should be illegal in all 50 states. They were so delicious. I devoured them. Each flavor was better than the next. Next time I'm going to get them double grilled so they get that crispy char on them.   We went here on a Saturday after being ignored at another bar that was literally a block up the street. I won't lie, I was feeling very dejected at our treatment at the other EMPTY bar during a college football Saturday. So when we walked into McCoy's I wasn't in the best mood.   They were pretty busy on a Saturday but when the owner saw us standing by the door he came and personally attended to us and sat us. He gave us a run down of how the restaurant got it's name (named after his dad), their specialties (wings) and even told us about their intensive cooking process for all their flavorful sides.  We ordered so many wings we couldn't finish them all. But they were all delicious. I think my favorite flavor was BBQ. My wife had a BBQ sandwich made into a wrap. They even put the slaw inside the wrap and BBQ sauces are on the table so you can load it up with each savory bite.   I had a burger and fries because you can never go wrong with a burger and fries. You'd think I'd have been full off of all the wings I ate but I still found room for that burger and fries before going home and falling into a food coma. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and we even ran into an old friend who was inside eating at the same time. What a coincidence.   Let me tell ya'll something. A little bit of friendliness, human decency and respect goes a LONG way. You really don't know what kind of day someone is having when they walk into your establishment. I was having a very sour afternoon after our treatment from the other bar up the road. And the small actions of having good customer service and a welcoming environment completely turned my day around.   I will definitely be returning here again. Not just for the food but for the entire lively environment and friendly staff.",

Mom and I stopped today and had chicken wings - buffalo and garlic Parmesan. Both were AMAZING. Absolutely one of the best of the best for wings - meaty, perfectly cooked. Fantastic. I never expected to like the garlic parm, but dammmmmn...The sauces were also delicious.  Pulled pork was 4/5 - flavorful and smokey but the choice of only 2 BBQ sauces was disappointing. I personally like a thicker sauce maybe with some crushed pepper little kick and thought the sauce was good but not great.   Mac and cheese was so good I'd trade my dog for the recipe. Not really lol, but it was that yum as well as the fried squash - TOTALLY CRAVE-ABLE  Waitstaff was friendly and helpful and perfect.  Massive disappointment? Blue cheese dressing which if you like buffalo wings is essential. It had an off- putting flavor I couldn't ID, possibly onion (a flavor I hate). But just... not good. That's likely my palate though. That might seem picky but I didn't care for it. The sweet tea was also very weak. Needs a bit more brewing. But all in all a wonderful meal and I will definitely return!",

I ordered the garlic Parmesan and Barbalo flavors, extra wet of course.  Garlic Parm-holy \"real garlic\" Batman! I found a beautifully roasted piece of garlic stuck to a wing and my whole perspective on this restaurant evolved! Any establishment that chooses real garlic over the alternative gets crazy kudos! Yum :).  Barbalo-y'all...these the barbalo, extra wet!? Finger licking good. Nomnom.  The only reason that I didn't give McKoy's five stars is because the wings, although delicious, were drier than I like my smoked wings to be. I prefer them to be juicer. However, I suggest giving the wings a go. Super yumsters.",

I got the pork bbq sandwich topped with coleslaw and a side of Mac n cheese. What can I say? It was an ethereal experience for my tastebuds. It was so delicious. The pork was perfectly tender and flavorful. It was also juicy. The coleslaw was perfectly tangy, a great compliment to the pork. The bun was sooo soft. The Mac n cheese  was AMAZING. An amazing cheese crust on top and beautifully cheesy and gooey. I loved my meal here. Our waitress was also very nice and super attentive (in a good way). Our service was also fast. I would definitely recommend this place and I'll make sure to stop by again!",

I have friends that swear by their wings, I have tried them twice, both just below par.   Last night we visited, I wanted to really give it another go.....   My wife got a Salad + BBQ, the BBQ was dry and not very flavorful, like it had been smoked earlier in the day or the night before and quickly warmed up.   I had the Country Style Steak which is a plain ass boring, no flavor hamburger patty, lightly bread, flash fried (I think) and served with white mushroom onion gravy.  I added pork belly to it.   The gravy was watery, no flavor.  The pork belly was awful, hard to chew and no flavor.  I have no idea why we have bad luck here.   We even got some mixed drinks, the pour was awful, all mixer.  WTF?   I have been to McCoys for bike night and they always had great, stiff, make you drink more - drinks!!!!!!!!!  So, considering they cancelled bike night and the above, I have no reason to ever frequent this establishment, there are way better choices in CLT.",

The Okra was amazing, fried hard and crispy to perfection, and not too salty! The wings were JUMBO. If I knew that the wings were jumbo I would not have ordered 20, trust me! The were cooked perfect, falling off the bone but still cooked thoroughly. The barbalo was amazing, never had a mix like that, but it was mixed great. The Parm-Garlic were different than I expected.

    "text": "So this place was pretty good. I'm not going to lie to say it's the best or the worst I've ever had but it is definitely good. First time being here and I have to say the owner Ryan is the one that made the experience for me. It was moderately busy and he made it a point to go around to each and every person and spread the love. That is what makes me enjoy being at a place when I eat, to see the man himself asking care of his business as I am a huge supporter of mom and pop type of businesses.   I had a very nice server (Brooke) that was attentive to me and my needs. She checked on me often but I do not feel like it was to much or to little. Sometimes you get a waitress that never checks on you or checks on you way to often and it is kind of annoying but she definitely had it figured out.   Ok but back to the food. I am not a wing fan (I do not eat meat on the bone it's weird but that's me haha) and this place is known for their wings but they definitely looked and smelled good. The pot roast was great, super tender, and has Ryan's families home style flavor and seasonings and I really enjoyed it. The mashed potatoes were great as well. The Mac and cheese was good but it was with real cheese (shouldn't be an issue for most people) but I personally like I guess more of a creamy type of cheese. I'm not saying it was bad though please do not get me wrong it was really good. Alas my appetizer. I went with the potato skins with some pulled pork added. It was taste, however looking back I think it would have been better if the potato itself was more... crisp. It seemed to be still a little flimsy if that makes sense and when I went to dip it into my sauce it gave a hard time. It was also pretty greasy/wet which I assume was from the abundance of cheese (not a bad thing haha) and pulled pork. Let's be honest though most things that are tasty are not clean to eat haha.   That's my experience. If you didn't read the whole thing I get it because I type a lot, but overall it was a great experience and I will definitely be coming back.",

As we had our 11 year old daughter with us we where a  bit apprehensive when we realised it was bikers night and the car park was full of bikers but we stepped inside anyway. We where greated by a server who told us they only had high tables free and would that be ok for our daughter and it was fine. Our lovely waitress Catherine appeared and despite the noise and the place full of bikers she made our daughter feel completely at ease. We ordered 3 plates of BBQ and the food was amazing. What we didn't finish we got boxed up and brought it with us. If your in Charlotte do yourself a favour and find this place it's amazing.",

We tried the pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches. The chicken is a must try! It's finished on the grill, which gives it a nice crispy char. I loved the coleslaw on the sandwiches.   Great comfort food!",

Also tried the ribs and they were ok. The sides are quite tasty, Mac&cheese, sweet potato fries, collards and fried squash. I wonder if pork is their best meat?

I've only eaten lunch here, but their lunch menu doesn't disappoint, & they usually have a pretty good special that most people get. And while I know the feel of the place gives off the saloon/biker feel, the food quality & taste will impress you. Their menu has many options, with a big enough selection for even your pickiest eaters. I had more of a southern meal, fried chicken with mac & cheese, & it was pretty good. It wasn't the best fried chicken I'd ever had, but I left full & happy for the price I paid.  Another big thing about McKoy's is the wait staff. They only hire beautiful girls, ones that catch the eyes of their customers. So you'll usually see a lunch crowd of mostly guys. The lunch crowd can get pretty large, so get there early or late to try and beat the line.  McKoy's is tucked away & may take a nod in the right direction for you to notice it, but it's worth the trip when you discover it. McKoy's atmosphere is very inviting & welcoming, along with an excellent menu & food taste that will bring you back again.",

It was a rainy day when we checked this place out and as we ran to the door to enter people who were exiting looked Happy and FULL & begin to tell us \"Best Choice Ever\". Our guest were excited and asked a couple questions to the patrons. We were say in the back corner booth for our party of 6.   My husband and I ordered the seafood fried with the squash. The squash was not as good as I read it to be, it had flavor with a lot of oil. The seafood was Meh ( I guess that's why it's a BBQ house not a seafood house ). Our guest on the other hand had Ba Ba Ba BarBeQue and they LOVED IT.  I wouldn't go back UNLESS we have guest that want pork BBQ.",

The hour hour specials were pretty blah. There's domestic beer specials and maybe a house or well cocktail / liquor type. It's more of a divey spot so you shouldn't expect a wealth of craft beer options and or fancy schmancy cocktails.

I put off trying this place because they don't serve brisket and while I like pulled pork I don't have the same love affair with it to begin with as I do with some nice juicy beef. Based on the reviews from other Yelpers I decided to go one evening after work to try this famous pot roast and I am now hooked.  We were enthusiastically greeted upon entering and led straight to a table. I ordered a $4 mango mojito which was promptly served and it was as sweet as it was refreshing. Since we were basically starving upon arrival we ordered the appetizer sampler. In hindsight this was too ambitious for just the two of us since we were ordering full diners as well. The nachos and potato skins were delicious and the establishment did not skimp on the cheese. I loved the chicken fingers which were juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I am not huge on bone in wings but my dining companion said they were excellent.   I ordered a soup as one of my fixin's, and it came out before the entrees as requested. It was potato and bacon and super creamy and filling. This could have easily served as an appetizer to hold me over until dinner.  When the mains came (we both opted for pot roast) I saw the soup again and when the waitress saw she remembered that I already had the soup brought out but shrugged and said that I get two soups today. This was totally okay with me - free food is one of my favorite things. The pot roast was completely tender. There was some fat to pick around but the generous portion made me feel like I wasn't being skimped on. They must cook this roast for hours to get the beef so tender. The darker sauce (not sure what it was called, not vinegar based) that was at our table was a great compliment to the pot roast.   Overall both the food and service were great and I will definitely be back! PS - the leftover pot roast made for great sandwiches the next day.",

Now my bf wanted ours double grilled....well that wasn't for me. They come exactly as it's worded on the menu \"crispy and charred\". No sauce (sweet BBQ) and nicely charred. My friend's regular ones had my mouth watering...next time next time. I just had to try the mac and cheese, of course. Oh dear gosh cheese! It was amazing! Get it!  I sat outside with a party of 8 to watch a Thursday night football game. Which was perfect because they have two tv's and put on the sound. The service was good too. I'll be back for some green beans (heard they are great) and some regular bar-Balo wings!",

The meat is smoked and just when it hits you know they aren't lying. The cornbread was slightly different than what I'm used too. It was cheesy and really good as well! A hit with my kiddos. We knew we made a good choice when you can smell the food from the parking lot",

Cassy, my waitress pointed me towards the ribs, and I was not dissapointed. They have both tomato based and Vinegar based sauce, and both were excellent. However, you don't need them, as the smoke ring went all the way to the bone, which the ribs fell right off.   Finally, I had saved room for desert, and the family recipe coconut pie was excellent. Save room for this to top off you dinner.",

The wings were grilled and had the perfect amount of char on them and they were full of flavor. The macaroni and cheese was delicious, creamy, and well seasoned. The waitress was friendly as well.

    "text": "I'll have to say that the award for this score, hands down belongs to John Ashley, the manager of this place. Rude, condescending, impatient, unprofessional, and quiet frankly, as arrogant as they come. The man clearly has no business being in front of the house, he should be exclusively in the back of the house.   Why? He literally exhibits the worst aspects of customer service. First, if a customer is complaining politely to you, don't raise your voice. Show some empathy, listen to the concern of your customer, show them respect, calm the situation and most importantly, just learn how to take some light constructive criticism, take ownership of the mistake and after apologize. Trust me, us telling you that the oil needs to be change in your fryer, doesn't mean it is an attack for him to get defensive. It simply means the chicken did not look golden at all, and we were served burnt chicken cooked in burnt oil, and it needs to be properly cleaned and disposed of. It's simply stating a fact, because you could both see it and smell it. This is an opportunity to simply fix a problem.   However, this is what you don't do, as to how John Ashley handled the situation.   Do not get defensive or Falsely accuse someone of \"cursing at you\", which by the way, it never happened.  Don't get loud with the customer. Don't shout over the customer. Never talk over a customer, and especially when they are trying to answer your questions, while you are interrupting with False assumptions. Definitely you should not ever say \"I don't know what else you want me to do\" after 2 minutes of a conversation with a customer. Definitely don't huff or puff and be dismissive of someone's complaint. And lastly, don't hang up on a customer not once, but twice because you don't like to hear a simple concern. If you're incapable in following these simple procedures, because you cannot put your pride aside, you shouldn't be a manager, and just stick to running the back of the house. Also, if a customer is trying to show some respect to you, how about you reach out and shake their hand, instead of walking out angrily because once again, you sir can't control your emotions. Clearly the owners need someone who knows efficiently how to run the front of the house. Clearly the owners need to spend some money for this employee to take some customer service classes or actually find a professional that knows how to properly deal with the customer, instead of looking for an argument.   The only positives? The server and staff were helpful. Some of my other dishes, like the Country Style Steak, which looked mostly like a Salisbury Steak, it had a nice sauce, but it was slapped with a few hamburger patties. Also, the Mac and cheese was cheesy, gooey and simply on point. I could eat it everyday! However, that won't ever happen with this experience. I can't recommend this place at all.",

    "text": "After furiously yelping \"BBQ in Charlotte\", we stopped here on our way down to Hilton Head.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here.  Food was awesome, price was reasonable and worth what you get.  Atmosphere: Was more local bar than BBQ restaurant, which I loved.  Casual, unassuming, chill.   Service: Great!  One of the owners recognized that it was our first time and brought us a sampler platter before we made our choices.  They were obviously very busy, but the service was fast, attentive and just what we needed.   Food: Started with the grilled wings, which were awesome.  Fall off the bone tender, would 100% recommend them again.    We wanted to try everything so ordered the Living the Dream platter, comes with chicken, ribs, pulled pork and pot roast.  Chicken and ribs were solid, honestly the chicken in the wing appetizer was way better.  The stars were really the pulled pork and pot roast.  I LOVE pulled pork and this was the best I have ever had.  Flavor without any sauce was juicy and tasty and the sauce options just elevated it.  I've never had bbq pot roast before, but this stuff is bomb.  We couldn't stop eating it.  For sides we got sweet potato fries and mac n cheese, most were great additions.  I mentioned before that the owner gave us a small sampler where we also got to try the greens which were also really good.  The portion for the price is fantastic and totally worth it.  We split the LTD between the two of us and had enough for 2 more dinners left over.   Overall: I want to drive back to the Carolinas to get more of this BBQ immediately.  I can't stop thinking about it... the pulled pork is having normal appearances in my dreams.  Do yourself a favor and go here immediately.",

Thanks to the Yelp Wing Fling I was introduced to their... wings. They are smoked to perfection and expect them to be a little bit pink. The chicken is juicy and tender almost fall-of-the bone like.   I heard on the local radio station that McKoy is famed for their Meatloaf, not knowing it was a Monday only special. So on a Monday, I remembered and tried it out. It's juicy with a crushed tomato based sauce that has a little kick to it. I almost wanted to say meatball sauce, but it got more texture to it. Paired it with yummy Mac'n'Cheese of course and fries, to soak up the sauce!  Parking is quite tough, not only is the lot tight, but during lunch or dinner rush, is packed, which is a good sign. It's a bar, saloon type setting, with high tables, booths and bar. Also locally known as a Harley Bar, I do roll up occasionally on a Ducati without getting a stink-eye. They have a lot of TV's and are a game day hot spot. You can also order their wings in advance for your viewing party at home. (HECK YAH!)  Staff is friendly and attentive, orders taken quick and food come out just as quick.",

My other also really liked their homemade blue cheese dressing. I also got a side of mac n cheese which wasn't bad either. The service is also on point.

In a group this size there was nary a menu item not sampled, and all were pleased with their selections. Southern hospitality & quality barbeque abound.",

    "text": "We were visiting from Atlanta, Ga and wanted some BBQ. Much like most cities, local places tend to have better food than chain restaurants. We saw the reviews on Yelp, which were pretty good so we decided to give them a try.  My husband ordered the wings. I ordered the pulled chicken. Our little one ordered grilled cheese. My son and husband were happy with their order, but I didn't like the pulled chicken. It tasted like a frozen dinner. I asked if I could switch it out for the wings. From the picture below, you'll see that I only took a bite out of it. Nonetheless, manager Aaron said if I switch it out, not only would I be charged for the pulled chicken, I would charge me for the wings also. He was upset that I didn't like the pulled chicken. To that end, he was very arrogant about it.  I ended up NOT eating the chicken and was shocked at how belligerent Aaron became about this. I spoke with a local who frequents the restaurant and they said they've seen this happen before. The local further stated that most people order wings, which is considered their most popular item. Whoever owns this restaurant should better train their managers. Everyone isn't going to like your food, but the most important thing is to make it right so the customers will come back. Not only will I NEVER be back to this place, I definitely don't recommend it!!!",

They did give large portions of food, but who really wants dry leftovers.

I was feeling adventurous so I gave it a shot.   It's not so much a biker bar as a biker inspired bar. I didn't see one Hog parked out front, however the interior is decorated with Hog Memorabilia and various motorcycle knick knacks.  The food is what we were there for, so that's what I'll review. The mac n cheese is the real deal Holyfield, complete with a perfectly browned top from being baked in the oven the way mac n cheese should be.   The greenbeans were so good I ordered them as an extra side and the blackened seafood platter was a hit. Spicy enough with out being too greasy.   They even had vegetarian options which is almost unheard of in Charlotte, much less at a BBQ joint. Needless to say I'm a fan and I can't believe it took me so long to find this place!   Oh yea and all of that was under $20! Priced to move.",

Their advertisement actually states that it should be called crack aroni n cheese because its that good and addicting. Well..... they are right. It is super cheesy and delicious. I could of had a whole bowl of it. The menu itself is smaller then most smokehouses or barbeque restaurants, however the food was all tasty and fresh. The staff was very pleasant and courteous. The restaurant is extremely easy to get to. I highly recommend checking out McKoy's for dinner or lunch.",

I went with the steak sandwich ( yes I am on an epic quest for best steak sandwich in clt) and it bearable.  It could have been one of the worst I had in charlotte.  What redeemed it was the mac n cheese though.  Now, thats a good mac n cheese! I watched all the bbq and ribs come out and realized that I friggin messed up.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy their food while i wish I could find a flux capicitor and never order the cheese steak.  There were plenty of beer specials and the service was pretty good for the light rail pub crawl group that was there. I am giving this place 3 instead of 2 stars for setting, mac n cheese, and how good everyone else's food looked.",

I ordered the seafood platter with fried white fish and grilled shrimp, collard greens and potato salad.The white fish was the best thing on the plate, that's the only reason I'm giving 3 stars. The shrimp was BURNT! I was highly annoyed that it was even served to me that way! The potato salad had no salt, and the collard greens lacked flavor. I couldn't believe a place in the south would serve bland potato salad and greens. I wish I had gone to different place for lunch.",

    "text": "I live relatively close to this place and for years drove right past it.  I finally stopped in and I was glad I did.  If the smell of the smokers doesn't clue you in, the food will clear up any mystery.    I will say the place is more of a saloon feel than a restaurant, which I like.  The lunch crowd varies quite a bit, but the place is a biker bar, so you will see some guys in their leathers hanging out... which again, is cool, don't let them get in your way of some good food.    On to the food, I keep hearing rave reviews about Mac's on this site and when Mac's opened I'd say they were the best, but the quality there has dropped as their business has picked up.  McKoy's has some of the best bbq I've had, great smokey flavor, good portions and good sauces to throw on top.  They continue to smoke their bbq in a manner that maintains that great subtle smokey flavor, where in my opinion Mac's has lost that smokiness that once made it so good.   I also branched out and tried their hot wings- as I'm a huge wing fan.  McKoy's served up some really good wings.  Again, great flavor, a little extra seasoning than most bar wings and they were cooked perfectly, not rubbery but not charcoal either.    If you're looking for good bbq and a place with a good set of other options, give McKoy's a shot... they'll make you forget all about that speedshop up the street.",

We stopped there twice (on our way and back from our destination) and both times we were very pleased with the service and food. The staff was friendly and attentive both times and provided our pup with cold water with ice cubes. The outside seating is covered and several fans were running with mist. It was hot outside but we were comfortable. They have a TV mounted outside and some music in the background. There is some traffic noise but it didn't bother us. We split a platter of barbecue the first time and it was very good. I think it was called the LTD (Living the Dream) platter or something similar. We got to sample a bit of everything. Very good. The second time we stopped our experience was very similar with the exception of no mist with the fans. We didn't say anything since it was a bit cooler that afternoon. We decided to try there double grilled wings and also split the BLFGT wrap with a side of fried squash. The wings were just how we like them...crispy and tasty. The wrap was so good and the fried squash was AMAZING! I'd go back just for it.",

Tonight my wife suggested it, so we went. And it was exactly what I expected--which is a good thing!  The atmosphere was laid back, to say the least. None of the pretentiousness you would find at Mac's Speedshop nearby. But McKoy's could probably use a little updating.  Anyway, on to the important stuff--the food. We started with fried green tomatoes. I followed that up with a barbecue platter that came with 2 sides. I selected mac & cheese and collards. The mac & cheese was outstanding. The other food was very good, but fell short of great. The barbecue was juicy and tender, but didn't have as much smokiness as I expected. Both types of NC sauces are provided on the table--eastern and western. I'm an eastern guy, so that's where I went. Again, it was very good, but not great. The bite of vinegar was definitely there, but I missed the red pepper kick. The collards were done right, again above average.  Overall, I was pleased with McKoy's, and look forward to returning soon.",

    "text": "Went to McKoy's this past Saturday.  I can't speak to the food, since I did not get to try any even after waiting over an hour and a half.  Just more concerned about the management.   We arrived on what seemed to be a busy night, but they did not seem to have too many folks waiting.  We asked how long the wait was for a 5 person table- the hostess (later found out manager) said \"it could be 10 minutes, it could be 30- we just sat a real big group.\" ALL 5 of us heard the same thing.  She put our name at the top of a new list on paper.  What we did not know- is they just sat 90% of the restaurant as one group, and the group had many more tables arriving over the next hour. They basically had a dinner reservation for over 100 plus people in a place that might not even seat that many.  We waiting over an hour, and I would admit became frustrated.  The hostess, pointed out a table that was \"ours\" when the group left, but then it was given to more arrivals of this huge party. We finally got a bar table for 5 after pushing for it, but heard from the tables around us that they were waiting for food for over 45 minutes- and we decided to give up and eat at Bojangles nearby.   While I can understand why they were in the situation with a hunder plus person group in the place- I can't understand why the management allowed us to put our name on a list in this situation or even thought anyone would be happy that night!  A group as large as the entire business is coming in for a meal- you have a few options: you don't take the reservation- since you can't give them good service; you close the restaurant and open for this group only, or you at least try to control the situation more by offering the group a limited or pre-ordered menu...   The staff were frustrated, and were frustrated with us, and we were frustrated with them.... but if they had just planned a bit better or told us the situation before we sat there for a long time- we could have had a good meal at another nearby eatery, and come back and enjoy this otherwie well rated Smokehouse another time.  THE FOOD LOOKED and SMELLED very good! Which in many ways made it even worse to have only seen it!",

    "text": "Saturday night around 9. Ordered the Sampler. Here was the MAJOR issue, which can be changed easily: the salsa and jalapenos  meant for the nachos crossed paths with other items and the juice made other items very HOT. I don't want jalapeno juice on my good. The potato skins were good as were the garlic and parm wings. Wings were a little dry. Chicken tenders were a throw away item. Chicken nachos were ok as well. I wasn't overwhelmed by anything and wouldn't order again. The waitress didn't put lemon in the water and forgot again when asked a second time. In fact, she seemed rather annoyed when we had a request.",

Good portions for meat, pretty standard portions for sides. I could have eaten more sides, but I'm glad I didn't. I took home left overs, who doesn't love ribs for breakfast?!

Way too much for me to eat in one sitting so I ended up with about a half a pound of q to take home. Fried squash is the best I have ever had! Delicious batter and cooked to perfection. I didn't have anything to dip it in like ranch but didn't need it. The spicy pinto beans were not that hot...I would say between a mild and medium heat. Very good though. My gf ordered a chicken wrap with the Mac n cheese side because of all the great reviews of Mac n cheese. We both thought the Mac and cheese was really good but not the best we have ever had. I would promote the fried squash and the fried tomatoes that we got as a starter. The tomatoes were cut thick and also had this amazing batter on it. We both thought they were cooked and sliced perfectly. A lot of places cut them too thin but not here. And to top it off they had $2 margaritas that we thought were great....especially for $2!",

We were disappointed that a bbq joint didn't have brisket but we were told that the pot roast was amazing so we were good with that. We started with the smoked wings that everyone raved about...bar-balo and calypso flavor. They were okay, I've definitely had better. Couldn't really tell a difference in the 2 flavors. For our entrees we had ribs with Mac n cheese & loaded baked potato & pot roast with Mac n cheese & green beans. The ribs were tough and were hard to get off the bone. The pot roast was extremely dry and tough. The green beans were mediocre. However, the Mac n cheese was amazing. Probably the reason I'm giving an extra star to this place. We basically only ate the sides so you would think the bartenders would have asked if we liked the food. Anyway...if you want good nc bbq I suggest not visiting McKoys and drive a few more miles up the road to Midwood Smokehouse.",

Try them with the Calypso sauce (which is a mix of BBQ and teriyaki sauce) and order them \"double grilled\".  Their wings are smoked and grilled (not fried) so you get a ton of flavor out of these meaty bad boys!!  We've been here three times but we can't get past ordering a pile of these wings.  The atmosphere is low-key and fun.  I really wanted to try the homemade coconut pie but they were sold out on the last visit...reason to go back!!  And...they carry Gentleman Jack : )",

There is a tomato-based sauce and what tasted like vinegar. They were ok but I would have liked more variety.

    "text": "Great atmosphere. Helpful wait staff. I got the LTD (Living the Dream), which is a sampler of ribs, BBQ pork, pit pot roast and smoked BBQ chicken. Mac and Cheese and Sweet Potato Fries as sides. Liked the ribs so much that I took some home to my wife (we live 3 hours a way - the smell in the car beats \"new car smell\" every day).   A tad expensive ($29.99 for a full rack of ribs). The LTD was $22.  I'll skip the sweet potato fries next time and might get a double order of Mac and Cheese. The wife liked the green beans I got her.  I liked her leftover Mac and Cheese. I'll probably just get the ribs next time.  Half a rack is more than enough.  I was going to give this 4 stars for the price, lackluster sweet potato fries, too much fat on the pot roast and a tad bit dry on the chicken, but the Mac and Cheese makes up for that extra star!",

At Only (with ONLY being capitalized and highlighted on the paper menu) $7.95 with two sides, I thought this was a steal.   When I got back to work though, there was only one breast. Had I known, I would have just paid the extra $2 for two breasts. 7.95 for one breast, is not a steal - I actually feel like I was stolen from. No one likes only one breast!   The chicken though, is very good and I mean VERY. Not greasy, very moist, and excellent crispy batter. Let me put it to you this way, I usually don't like fried chicken breast, even from the ever so famous coop. Mckoys breast, is wow.   The mac n cheese Never disappoints and mashed potatoes are quite tasty and whipped nicely.  All in all, a loyal customer now I am.",

    "text": "Had my 2nd visit to McKoy's on Saturday for lunch.  Before heading to the airport my friends wanted BBQ one more time and I figured they'd tried Mac's, let's go somewhere else.  It was a bit of a let down this time.  Our server was new, and she told us this at the end of our meal.  But really it was painfulyl obvious from the way she gave someone sweet tea instead of unsweet and forgot to differentiate between the regular Coke and the diet's.  Oh well she was sweet if not a bit out there.  We started with fried green tomatoes and the wings in the bar-balo sauce.  Both were good and I really liked the wing sauce, it had a nice tang to it but not spicy (I can't handle any spicy foods).  All 4 of us ordered ribs, 2 full racks and 2 half.  I got a half w/side salad and sweet potato fries.  The salad was really good for a side and the honey mustard dressing was yummy.  The 1/2 rack of ribs was still too much food.  The 2 who got the full looked shocked when the food arrived.  The sweet potato fries were not as good as last time, I kept raving about them to anyone who would listen, this time they were just average.  The ribs were okay, I've had much better.  And apparently the complaint from those w/full rack said half was really moist and the other half was dried out and tough.  Took a bite of mac and cheese and it was good.  I'd go back again.  The wings were solidly good on both trips and they have good drink specials.  I just would probably not go out of my way to head back soon though.",

    "text": "I finally had the pleasure of trying out McKoy's Smokehouse last night, after hearing from many people of the restaurant's awesome BBQ menu.   My wife and I got 20 wings to split, so that we could give multiple sauces a try (we're sauce people, don't judge). Side note: $.50 wing night on Thursdays during NFL games! Whoot whoot. We went with the buffalo, bar-balo, thai-chili & calypso.  Handsdown, my favorite was the Thai-chili, with bar-balo coming in as a close second. The wings were extremely tender, almost easily falling off the bone. They had a great smokey taste to them as well, which would be a little over-powering if you are expecting traditional wings where you just taste a sauce. Overall, these are some of the best grilled/smoked wings I've ever had!  Side wise, don't even waste your time with anything other than the Mac & Cheese. We made the mistake of ordering french fries, what a joke. $3.50 and they were about the size of a small order at a fast food joint. AND they weren't even that great to justify it. The mac & cheese, however, was a heaping mount of cheesy heaven.",

Waitstaff was very nice and helpful.   Full Disclosure: not an extreme fan of BBQ so my review may be bias  A-: Smoked Wings (buffalo sauce) - you can definitely taste the smokiness, buffalo sauce was okay, good with ranch  B: Living the Dream (LTD) - a sample of pull-pork, pot roast, chicken and ribs - NOTE: this is more than enough for 2 ppl to share.  Pull-pork was nicely cooked, chicken was smoked but little on the dry side.  Ribs and pot roast was ok. You get 2 types of bbq sauce, a vinegar base and sugary one.  A+: Fried squash - thinly cut and heavily breaded.  LOVED it!  Was still good as leftovers   A-: Coconut pie - very coconutty. Freshly made, just a little too sweet for my taste.  Overall, a good experience.  Do recommend for out of towners!",

    "text": "My husband and I, along with our teenage son, really enjoyed McKoy's.  The 3 of us were really hungry, so split the sample appetizer platter along with LTD (Living the Dream) dinner amongst the 3 of us.  We had the Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad for our sides.  My son ate the Mac and Cheese and loved it.  My husband ate most of the potato salad and liked it, but did add a little mustard.  All of the meats were delicious.  The ribs from the LTD dinner and the wings from the app plate were my favorites.  The pot roast was truly yummy too.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I would definitely look McKoy's up, and I will likely have a rib dinner.  We were full enough , but not stuffed, so when our fantastic waitress mentioned deep fried cheesecake with ice cream, we decided to split an order.  Really amazing!  Think deep fried ice cream meets sopapilla's - only with cheesecake.  1 order split 3 ways was the perfect dessert for the 3 of us.  We went about 7 on a Monday eve in July.  There was just a short wait.  Don't expect a quiet ambience .  We didn't think it would be, so we were fine with the noise from the other diners and from the bar.  Lots and lots of TV's.  We thought the prices were reasonable.  Or tab before tax and tip was $65.  Considering the quality and volume of food, that seemed reasonable to us.  Certainly not a bargain, but worth it for really excellent BBQ.",

On the recommendation of my server I ordered the pulled pork plate with a side salad,  mac 'n' cheese and dinner roll.  Salad was unremarkable - not much room for creativity in that area. Mac 'n' cheese was tasty and a good-sized portion, but the pork was unremarkable. The menu made a big deal of it being smoked over pecan wood, but to me it didn't taste very smoky and it was kind of greasy. Two kinds of sauce are offered - the traditional Eastern Carolina vinegar style, which didn't have much tang and a tomato-based version which tasted like nothing more than ketchup. Dinner roll was dense as if it had too much flour.  There are great places to go for BBQ in Charlotte. To me, McKoy's ain't one of 'em.",

We had a few extra days in Charlotte before a wedding, and found this great smokehouse and saloon not far from our hotel. It is not the fanciest of restaurants...but hey, what do want? It's a saloon. And a very clean one with super friendly service. Not used to this \"southern hospitality,\" especially coming from New York. There were 5 of us dining that evening, and we found the food to be absolutely delicious. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was out of this world! The portion was generous, it had a terrific smokey taste, and there was not a shred of fat to be found. Would rate it the best so far. It will be hard to find another place to top it. Our waitress, Ashleigh, could not have been nicer, and patiently took our order during a very busy dinner hour. Definitely a return spot when traveling to this area again!",

They probably put it in a greasy pan add seasoning and chicken stock, wrap it and toss in a conventional oven for a few hours. That's not Bbq to me. Didn't fall off bone tasted liking boiled ribs with sauce on it. The grilled wings .... That shit was burnt. The sides tho, corn bread, mash tater, baked mac.

The pull pork was traditional. The pot roast was unique. I've had bbq brisket but never pot roast. It was a unique and delicious choice.  Everything had a nice smoked flavor.  The portions were huge. No one could finish the LTD. I made a meal out of my doggie bag.  The salads were crisp and clean. The mac and cheese was great.  They had two sauces, a NC vinegar and a sweet mild tomato based.  The reataurant is a bar in a log building, a bit dark. We ate on the porch.  TL; DR - great bbq, good sides, nice ambience. We will return.",

Being California kids we were anxious to find some good local food...we got that and more.  First the food; Our rowdy party of three had the LTD (Livnin The Dream) plate, the ribeye steak and a regular ole pulled pork plate. All were fantastic. THe steak was cooked perfectly, the pulled pork was tender and smokey... and the LTD plate was an experience in and of itself. Even the green beans, collard greens and mac n cheese blew our collective socks off. To top it all off... the in house sauces at the table were the proverbial icing on the cake. The house vinegar based sauce was perfect with the pulled pork. Last, but not least, the staff; Everyone was alot of fun. As I said...we had had a long day and were pretty rowdy. My cohorts even lost the ability to read the menu for some reason, so the waitress had to take extra time explaining the side item choices... or fixxins. She was a great sport, and even kicked some rowdy attitude back in our direction which made for even more fun. The manager also stopped by a few times to check in and had some fun with us, good to see people at least appearing to enjoy their jobs. It made for us having a great experience. Big Thank You to McKoys! I am not sure when I will be back to Charlotte, but when I am,rest assured I will be back!",

They had good reviews, were busy on a Monday night, and it had my type of vibe inside. That being said my wife and I each ordered wings with a side. No alcohol, no appetizers, just a dinner. An hour later the food comes out. I understand a wait, that's fine. There was a big party outside. Buuuttt after an hour I got barely lukewarm wings with the lovely addition of a 16\" curly hair on two of them. Waitress was visibly flustered all night and it took us another 10 minutes to get silverware and napkins. $40 and an hour and a half wasted. I feel bad posting a review without talking to the manager, but I just wanted to leave, nothing short of giving me a lot of money could've made it better.  This all being said the waitress mentioned they had a bunch of new cooks. Do not discount this place completely, I think it was just a bad night. The okra and cornbread were very good. However I would give them some time to figure stuff out before visiting.",

Great sports viewing place, the food is great....i wasn't that hungry so i had potato skins and wings with their sweet BBQ sauce (it also came with carrots/celery and ranch dressing. Wings are judged by how many napkins you have to use to clean up...i used all of them about 6.....then i decided to order dessert...imagine the perfect round creamy cheesecake sitting on a bed of graham cracker crust, then on top sprinkles of same graham crackers AND SALTED CARAMEL drizzle....not too much not too little, JUST RIGHT.  Then beside your perfect cheesecake is a little squirt of whipped cream just saying HELLO......this is called dessert heaven. Hubby had a ribeye steak that was wonderful (yes i had a bite).....he ate every bite of his coconut cream pie slice....yes we will be back.....and Morgan was in our section...very friendly and knowledgeable.",

When I told her the tea tasted off, she rudely informed me they make it there. The fried squash was slapped on the plate in a pile of grease and tasted like mush. Every restaurant has bad days, so last week I tried again. Sassy server was not there, and our server was good. But the fried green tomatoes were over cooked, tasted like old grease, floating in the old grease along with the burned bacon crumbles. The manager removed from the table and confirmed they were overcooked. When the rest of the food arrived, my salad was wilted pale lettuce. The fried squash was even more soggy and greasy with the same old grease taste. The pulled chicken was pretty tasty though. My friend ordered the chicken nachos, and the chicken was old, pale and cold.  About how I felt at this point and I was ready to leave. Why not use that yummy pulled chicken on the nachos? When we left, our server was on break enjoying her meal, so it took some extra time with a new server to get a drink to go.  Place needs a little help.",

I asked for a different table, and the waitress put me in another small table at the other end of the bar.  The food was okay - portion of pot roast was not pot roast but brisket, but a humongous portion - it must have been over a pound of meat, dumped on a plate.  Fortunately, they had some barbeque sauce, which made it palatable.  I ate about 1/4 of it and left the rest.  For what it is it is good. Personally, I will not go back.",

I know I know...sort of contradicting but not really (see what I did there?) the cornbread is served with butter and has sweet corn in the mixture. I observed other customers ordering the pot roast.

For each day during lunchtime why have a different special. Thursday was pulled pork with two sides decided to get the Mac n cheese and spicy pinto beans but they have many more side dish options. My meal was a little to much for lunch but was perfect all around. Pinto beans were great the Mac and cheese was good but the pulled pork was awesome. Great spot for lunch and I assume even better for dinner. Definitely recommend if in The area",

    "text": "After a whole day of flying from SFO to Houston and finally to Charlotte, my coworker and I were running on EMPTY. Since we had such a late flight, there weren't a lot of options left for a Sunday night dinner, but when we stumbled upon McKoy's Smokehouse & Saloon that boasted a four star rating and was open until 2 am, it was practically a no brainer to get there and refuel.  As expected, the restaurant wasn't very crowded, but for a Sunday night, we were surprised to find a decent number of parties enjoying a late dinner like we were. We were offered a \"late night\" menu that had basic BBQ sandwiches, platters, and various sides like fries, coleslaw, and salads. Starving, I chose the McKoy's hamburger with a side of mac and cheese.  Considering the lack of a crowd, I was surprised that the wait for food was a bit lengthy, but I suppose that just meant the food was cooked fresh. Presentation wise, the hamburger was massive with vibrant fresh veggies piled on a charred beef patty and a large bun. The mac and cheese was strangely presented like a hump, but it looked pretty good.  Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving. The one thing that lacked from the entire entree was SEASONING. How could a BBQ place be so bland? I'm not one to put ketchup on burgers, but my goodness, I practically drizzled the condiment ALL OVER my burger just to get the taste of something besides charred meat and bread. (Charred is putting it lightly; it practically veered towards burnt.) Then on top of the severely under seasoned burger was the mac and cheese that was coated with what felt like congealed cheese. Where was the ooze? Where was the creaminess? It honestly tasted like they used day-old cheese to coat the macaroni pasta.   I walked in starving, so to be perfectly honest, my standards were quite low, but even then, I couldn't find anything in my dish to be impressed about. The only reason I gave this place two stars instead of one is because the service was friendly and the restaurant itself has a cool vibe. I'm not too sure where the \"saloon\" part comes in, but it's definitely a bar where you can watch any game imaginable on FIFTEEN television screens strewn all over the walls.   Did I finish what I ordered? I was too hungry not to. But was I that hungry that I couldn't tell McKoy's was an absolute disappointment? No way.",

    "text": "I came to McKoys for lunch with a friend after hearing so many great things about it. We started off with a platter of 20 wings, 4 sauces, double charred. It came with a bunch of their homemade blue cheese for dipping. The wings were simply amazing. We had barbalo, calypso, Carolina cider, and then a habanero flavor recommended that was not on the menu. All were good but the habanero took the show. The blue cheese is out of this world and they give you a lot- though we finished it! The meals were next. I got the pot roast special with beans and mashed potatoes. Sides were great, the pot roast was as dry as jerky. This isn't what I am used to when it comes to pot roast. It was literally smoked chewy jerky pieces or something. I would never order it again. My friend got a large pulled pork platter with Mac and cheese and potato salad. His pork was super dry with no real smoky flavor to it. He didn't like the meat and I tried it- didn't like it either. His Mac and cheese was good. The yellow potato salad he equated to the stuff you get at the Walmart deli. Overall, I would say stick to the amazing wings, maybe a blue cheese salad, and the select sides that are great. Ironically since this is a smokehouse, I would avoid their other meats. Service was excellent, atmosphere is no frills but lively and comfortable.",

I wasn't even mad because I knew I shouldn't have been there. Me & McKoys just don't mix. Maybe I don't order the right entrees. But I can't see it. McKoys just isn't for me.",

    "text": "This place had a Cool vibe. Very low-key. We got here in the midst of biker weekend so it was a mixed crowd.   The mac and cheese is incredible. I should have had it as my full course.  The collard greens were very good. Especially after I added the chili vinegar to it. The chicken wings with buffalo sauce were good but I can understand why they give you the option of double grilling it. They were a few that were on the soft side but overall still very good.  The Fried Chicken which they do state will take over 20 minutes looks really good on the plate but had too much breading. I tried the LTD which has a mix of barbecue chicken, ribs, pork and roast. It was okay. There is a lot of meat which is good but not the most flavorful barbecue I've ever had. Service was slow but it's understandable given the fact that it was a busy weekend. I had a good time but wasn't overwhelmed hence three stars.",

    "text": "We have been to McKoys twice now and are ready to return again very soon. The first time we came to McKoys we were looking for a place to eat late at night, so we were only given the late night menu. Our server was extremely friendly and gave us some recommendations for the best food items. We went with the pulled pork and chicken wings to share. The pulled pork was really good and our server even gave us a side of the famous mac and cheese even though it was past the time they usually serve it. The mac and cheese was the best I have ever eaten! The only item I was not a huge fan of was the chicken wings, but that is probably because I am from Buffalo and can be a bit of a chicken wing snob (wish they were slightly crispier).  The second visit we ordered the ribs (YUMMY) but decided to try the green beans as our side along with the mac and cheese. To be fair I am not a fan of green beans, but due to all of the hoopla we decided to try them and HOLY DELICIOUSNESS were they scrumptious. So the takeaway would be to definitely order the ribs, pork, green beans and mac and cheese.  My favorite part of this place is the very cozy bar atmosphere that create an enjoyable way to watch a sporting event. Also, everyone that has waited on us has been extremely friendly and helpful. We will be back to McKoys VERY SOON.",

The guy at the hotel front desk suggested some shaddy areas around the hotel for \"decent\" food, he clearly didn't yelp. Thankfully I walked in and out of one of his suggestions and found this gem!   Seeing as I was around the airport I wasn't getting my hopes up for a fabulous meal, however this place surprised me. The food was great, the wine pour was ample and the atmosphere is what I'd expect from North Carolina- bar/restaurant.   I got the regular pork platter which came with two sides, I went with the baked potato and green beans. The amount of food was perfect seeing as I was a starving travel!  The staff was friendly and refilled drinks as needed.   If you are staying at the Clarion Hotel... go about .2 miles and you will stumble upon this gem.",

I had the Pot Roast platter since they don't serve brisket. It was good but not even close to brisket. The go to side dish is baked Mac n cheese. It's awesome! The cole slaw was good too and mayonnaise based. McKoys also makes killer chicken wings. Make sure you get the twice grilled where they smoke the wings until tender then grill them to crispy up the skin. Outstanding!!! Some of the best ever wings!",

    "text": "I used to really enjoy coming here when I lived in Charlotte.  I don't get back often, so I had to get some of their grilled wings to take back to MD during my recent visit for the game.  So after a 6 HR drive, I was super excited to get home and eat my wings, after all these are some of the best wings I've had in my life.  How upset I was when I opened my to go box to find only six of the 12 wings I ordered.  I had a split flavor order (barbalo and calypso), but only had the 6 barbalo.    I immediately called and asked to speak to the manager.  Although she was nice, she almost sounded like she didn't believe me.  I gave her the check # and all.  She kept reiterating so you ordered 12?  Umm yea you see it on the ticket, and there isn't even an option to order 6, at least I didn't see one on the menu.  So she promises me the head manager will call me in a day or so.  It was Monday, and today is Thursday, and I haven't heard a word.  It's only $6 or so, but it's the principle.  I essentially paid almost $18 for 6 wings and pasta salad, and I gave the bartender a $2 tip.  Had I known she was giving me half my order, I would've kept the tip.  So $20 for 6 wings and pasta salad?  Now while I'd agree it's just as much my job to check my order to make sure it's correct, it's also their job to make sure they are giving you what you ordered.    While I used to love the wings, I definitely won't be back here.  If they do this to a couple customers a day, someone's getting over.  Definitely NOT the McKoy's I was used to when I lived in Charlotte.",

We got 6 buffalo style - twice grilled as recommended here by other reviewers. They were extra crispy and not too spicy.  We both ordered the pork plate. The small is plenty of pork! My husband ordered the large and was unable to eat it all. They have both ketchup based BBQ sauce and vinegar based BBQ sauce on the table. Collard greens were good but spicy. I'm not a big fan of the spiced up version some places do. Gas station right next door so we topped off the rental car tank and we were at the airport in no time!",

Potatoes I think are real (not instant) & pasta salad both were excellent! Plus PB pie for dessert was light & fluffy & awesome too!!  (normally not a PB pie fan! but I am with theirs!)    Overall, everything in one word was EXCELLENT!!!  I work around the corner & will definitely be going back! Can't wait!! Yum! :)",

I'm no foodie, so I can't really put in to words what I was experiencing. I also had the Monday special Meatloaf with mashed and green beans. Delicious. Only $11 too which was a solid deal. Check this place out for sure.",

Decent draft beer selection.  Bud, the bartender, was super friendly.   Great casual bar/ restaurant.  Couple steps above classic hole in the wall.   Tons of big screen TVs.  Every NFL game available.   Second time I have eaten here in 3 days.   Very solid BBQ place.    If you are in Charlotte, worth the trip.",

Everything on the menu looked amazing and I will be back with my motorcycle on bike night.",

    "text": "I'm not at all a motorcycle type gal, so I've driven past McKoy's a thousand times and never even wanted to try it, but today my coworkers decided it was where they wanted to go so it's where I ended up.  They told me the bbq was great so I tried to be optimistic.    We arrive- it's packed, which I hoped was a sign that it's good food.  But as we continued to sit and wait to have our drink orders taken, I realized why there were so many people in there...  because they were all waiting for some portion of their lunch to happen- ordering, waiting for food, or paying.  It was an agonizing 90 minutes for lunch.  I got fried green tomatoes as my meal.  The guys both got the daily special.  Why the process took so long I don't know.  There seemed to be no waitresses?  Lots of guys wearing McKoys shirts were delivering food, but not many actual waitstaff.    As the 90 minute mark rolled around, I finally got irritated and added the total roughly in my head and just threw the money on the table and and we left.  An hour and a half for two daily specials, fried green tomatoes and sweet tea?  I think not.  I won't be back.",

But it's more of a casual pub than an upscale restaurant.   The bartender is great, made me a custom drink not in the menu. (I wanted a fruity rum drink). We've been several times, and will keep going!",

We ordered cornbread, shrimp & grits, bbq sampler platter (LIVING THE DREAM) with Mac n cheese & fried okra.  OMG!  Awesome meal!  I would recommend this place to anybody!

    "text": "Holy crap how had I never been here before?!  My friend talks about how good it is all the time. I figured she was right, but I'm pretty picky when it comes to certain things: like mac n cheese. If it's not amazing, I'm unimpressed. Same with blue cheese dressing.   This place does not even look like it would have better than slightly-above-average food. I loved the low-key biker bar feel. I did not expect everything to taste quite as good as it did. The buffalo chicken sandwich had just the right thickness for a bun - not too much; I hate when it's so bready the sandwich seems dry. Nope, not a problem here. The fries were good and not overly-salted (in fact, I added a little salt, which is rare for me). The buffalo sauce was delicious, and the blue cheese dressing was homemade and so good.  I tasted a bite of my friend's mac n cheese and she's lucky I didn't just grab the rest off of her plate ...  The only downfall to our visit is our food took quite a long time to come out. But the owner apologized to us and the waitress said the kitchen was just really backed up. My friend didn't indicate that this was a regular problem, so no big deal.  My only problem is going to be what to order next time! Everything else on the menu looks so good, too!",

    "text": "We've driven by here plenty of times and finally stopped in tonight. Definitely will be back! All the previous reviews are dead on regarding the service. The staff are some of the most attentive we've ever had in a restaurant. They make sure you're taken care of but don't hover which is perfect to me. The food is equally amazing! Smoked pot roast is delicious, fall apart, full of flavor. I had smoked salmon and the taste of the grill was so right. You get a hint of smoke but not too much and the fish was cooked perfect, not dried out at all. Mac n cheese, green beans, fried squash was all from scratch, queso dip is their own twist with some spinach in it but better than most I've had. The only negative was the beer could have been just a bit colder. Hubby got the OMB copper and it was cold but not the ice cold he was hoping for. He guessed it was at about 50 degrees and could have been closer to 42. They don't have a drink menu but have a full bar so they can make pretty much anything you could want. We will definitely be back!!",

When she did, she was short and didn't give us the opportunity to request anything. It seemed as though we were an inconvenience to her. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was bland and flavorless. My burger was the only good part of my meal. The \"crack-aroni\" and cheese, which I heard was their best dish, was just okay.   All in all, I was not too impressed with McKoy's. I may give it another shot, but not anytime soon.",

These are NOT your average nachos - outstanding and even better with the BBQ sauce on top. My nine year old ordered the kids ribs with green beans and ate every bite. Great service by Amanda and food came fast. Would come back for sure!!!!",

Lots of big screen TVs and choices to watch your favorite game. The Beer was priced right (Great Specials) and the food was spot on.  I had the pulled pork barbecue, and the portion size was extra generous. The Fixins (sides) were prepared perfectly. Highly recommend the collards! Service was prompt and courteous, and you could feel the local ownership in the commitment of all of their team. Definitely a restaurant I would come back to again, solo or with friends.",
