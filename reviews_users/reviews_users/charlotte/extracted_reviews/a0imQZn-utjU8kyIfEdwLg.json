I've never eaten in but we get pizza/wings for take out all the time. It is slightly pricey when you get into adding lots of toppings but just cheese pizza is great. Really no complaints.  It's my choice of pizza places in the Mint Hill/Matthews area every time.",

First of all don't go in there looking for a grandma or Sicilian slice because they will look at you like your crazy, they literally said they don't know what that is! Also I went in  at 700 pm one night to give them a second chance and I asked for 4 slices to go, they told me they only had 2 and they weren't making anymore! I was shocked! What kind of pizza place that doesn't close until 9 doesn't make another pie? The taste is bad, the service is bad, and it is not NY style.",

The sauce is simple but pure and does not have a lot of spice to it. They serve the NY style big slices (which I'm not a raving fan of in general) but this one was pretty good...yes I used a knife and fork to hack off the bottom part but either way. It was good ZA and I'll be back.  I'm not sure where this falls on my Pizza list for CLT yet but I will update.",

This place has the largest slices of NY style pizza I have ever come across in the Charlotte area. The pizza they cut them off of is a huge 28\" pie and pulling just 8 slices from each pie makes for some gut busting eating. Also, the slices themselves only cost 3$ for the cheese and for another 50 cents each you can add toppings to make whatever combination you'd like. I know its NY style but I usually like a little extra sauce on my pizza but irregardless it was still awesome all the way around.",

The rest of the menu is a bit limited, but if you're just looking for pizza, this place is a good bet.  The greek salad is also pretty good, heavy on the feta and black olives, which I love, and onions, which I don't, but are chunky enough to be picked off. If you are having a party for kids, you can go for the huge take out rectangle pizza, but I wouldn't order that for adults (as most pieces are inside slices, without crust)The restaurant itself isn't much in the way of atmosphere, so we've done take out, or in years past delivery.  If you want take out pizza in Mint Hill, this is a great alternative to Hawthorne's. And it's nice to support a local, small business.",

Their pizza is spot on - great crust with a slight crunch, the perfect amount of cheese and oregano melted on top, and most importantly it doesn't just drip grease when you pick it up. In the never-ending search for great pizza down south Big Guys should be one of your first stops. And don't be surprised if it's your last too!!!",

I decided to give Big Guys a go tonight and ordered their 18\" veggie pizza to go. The wait was standard, about 25 minutes, which I didn't mind. Service was decent. I grabbed my pizza while still hot outta the oven and took a peek in the car to soothe my hunger pangs... and dammit I was instantly disappointed. The pizza was undercooked all in the center, complete with soggy canned toppings and cheese that slid right off. I tried to make some excuse to avoid marching right back in...solely for the fact that I was SO hungry. But after my quick arrival home I realized all hope was lost for this pizza. The pie was so soggy it would separate from the center when pulling a piece from the box. On top of that, there was no flavor at all. Did they even put sauce on this?? Papa Johns down the street does a better job, and that's unfortunately saying a lot... first and last dollar ever spent here. Would NOT recommend!",

I arrived @ 50 minutes later, paid for my 2 plain cheese pies and was told they'd be ready in a few minutes. By the time 1 1/2 hours had gone by since I placed my order, I would have simply left if I did not already pay. I watched numerous people walk in and pick up there orders as well as a family that came in after me, sit down order and get their food before I did.   Anyway, the pizza is good - but that was the worst wait I've ever had. If I had gone to Hawthornes, they would have given me a discount or even free pizza as they value their customers. I will not order on Friday from Big Guys EVER again.",

    "text": "Still catching up on reviews. This was a hard one to rate. Yelp should add half star options as I feel it deserved better then 3 stars but not 4 stars.  Folks are very nice. Service very slow. I mostly get take out orders from them while asking 'how long', depending on the time of day, before In should arrive to pick up.  They normally say approx 30min.  Wanting my food hot, I always get there at 20-25 minutes as Id prefer to be a tad early and wait a couple minutes, leaving with hot food, rather then arrive with my meal already done and just sitting on the counter.  Yet every order I've placed has taken over 1 hour. Many of these orders are at times where I am literally the only customer, in between lunch and dinner. Nobody eating in and nobody other then me picking up takeout.   Thankfully the folks working there are nice, so I at least can chat with them as I wait, rather then staring at the walls.  On to the food. Pizza. Not bad. Not NY Style, but closer to NY Style then others.  Sauce had good flavor.Decent crust. Overall 4 stars on the pizza. If your expectations are reasonable, you should enjoy the pizza.  Wasnt overly impressed with some of their main dishes. Pasta was overcooked and watery in every pasta dish I've had (pasta should be al dente...cooked just enough to be firm). Flavor was very bland on not only the pasta, but the main dishes as well. If your expecting garlic, your wondering where the garlic flavor is. Pretty much the same with all their dishes. Just bland....Nothing that says 'great, cant wait to come back'. Just ok. Portion sizes are fair, but overpriced comparing to others establishments. If the dishes had great flavor and weren't so hum drum, the prices would be fine, but you cant give out small portions, lacking in quality and flavor and expect to charge 4 or 5 star prices.  Its strange that the pizza/sauce has good flavor, but for whatever reason, the main dishes lack that flavor.  The Subs again, disappointed. Not bad, but again, overpriced and nothing to get excited about. Prices are about $7 for a basic 8inch sub with cheeze. Tomato and all other toppings are .75 each. Add 2 or 3 toppings that are typically included in most subs and your now at $10 for an 8inch sub, that is still more bread then meat/cheese/toppings. Lots of places have 13inch loaded monster subs for less money. A $10+sub should fill you up. A $10+sub should also be 13inches and filling. $10+ for an 8inch sub that will leave you hungry is just not right.. The bread is good, but for the $'s, they need to have a better bread/meat/fillings/toppings ratio. I love good bread. But I dont want the bread to overwhelm the meats, cheeses and etc. Again, charging 4 and 5 star prices, should deliver a 4 or 5 star product.$10+ for a small sub is absurd. Id be happy with the 8inch, and even at $10+, but it would have to be fully loaded and filling. Paying $10+ dollars for a sub that is small, more bread then anything, that leaves you still hungry is unsatisfactory, imo.  Overall, I guess 3 stars is fair. The folks are nice, so 4.5 stars for that. The service is way too slow so that gets 2 stars (if your not busy and have employees walking around acting bored, why does it take over an hour to get a pizza?)  The pizza I give 4 stars. Not the best, but pretty decent.    The main dishes and subs are about 2- 3 stars at best.  If in the area, I wouldnt hesitate  to rec stopping in for the pizza, but its not worth going out of your way for. Lots of good pizza places popping up, and Mint Hill is crazy. Its Mint Hill after all, yet there seems to be good quality pizzeria's popping up all over the place.  And if in Charlotte/Matthews, there are plenty of pizza places as good/better and cheaper.  So, if your in Mint Hill, try it out and compare to others. If you find yourself there at lunch, maybe stop in for a couple slices. Worth trying if your close, but not worth going out of your way for.  Happy eating...",

There are no other choices. First service was not great at least 4-5 ppl working. We needed plates an I had to ask a few times.  Food was not what I like but at least flavor the meats with oregano or basil calzone I tool home an doctored up. Not on my list of recommendations",

So we search Yelp and found this spot which was on the way.  It's a nice family owned place that was comfy and roomy inside (5/5).  The decor is sparse but not in a negative way.  You place your order, get your own drinks, sit and wait for the food; piece of cake.  We ordered the lasagna with meat sauce; 2 orders of the spaghetti with meat balls; and a 14 inch cheese lovers pizza.   By all accounts the food was good (4/5).  Few negatives include the spaghetti sauce being a bit to watery and needing a bit more salt, and the garlic knots being just a tad doughy.  Other than that, shark eyes all around. The lasagna was flavorful and the cheese pizza was amazing...the cheese tasted sooo buttery!!  Hold on while I regain my composure .  Also had to take a pic of the largest pizza I've ever seen.  Just a monster!  The gentleman could just barely get the box through the door!  We recommend you try this place and we would definitely come back!",

Staff always recognizes me, as I work in the area and visit for lunch fairly often.  Eat in or carry out available.   They offer pizzas, calzones and multiple Italian dishes.   I recommend calling ahead for carry out options.  For the Super Bowl we ordered the 28\" Big Guy with Pepperoni.  We had the pizza sliced Into 16 slices instead of the normal 8.  NY style pizza with the right amount of seasoning, tasty sauce.   Everyone at our SB party was pleased with our pizza!  Give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed!",

At one point I had rated this place 5 stars many moons ago; for years the pizza was always amazing......the last few visits had a slow decline in service, friendliness (thanks to the kids/children that work here), and overall pizza quality.         The kids/children that work here have attitudes and aren't friendly at all.   It's like they are part of the family so they got a \"in\" and this is just a job to make some spending cash so they don't care and treat their patrons like they don't matter.   The last pizza I got was burnt and tasted horrible so I threw it away.   I'm actually pretty sad but will not be giving Big Guys Pizza my business anymore.",

On the contrary, the slices are NY style. It was a tad too greasy for my liking. By the time I got to the crust, I forgot how greasy it was. The crust certainly tops this bite off right!   If I'm in the area again, I'd give them a shot to see if perhaps our timing was not inviting. Restaurant is good for the locals in the area wanting a NY slice conveniently.",
