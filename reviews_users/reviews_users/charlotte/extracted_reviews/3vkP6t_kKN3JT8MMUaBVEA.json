In any case, being impatient and super hungry, I ordered to go.  The buckwheat pancakes were a hit with me.  I ordered the special apple pancake.  It was heavy but looked good.  It is more like a baked apple dessert.  I can't tell you how it tasted because I opted not to have any.  I am confident It will be devoured by someone in the house with some vanilla bean ice cream!  Oh, while I was outside walking in the lot, the staff member came out and hand delivered my order.  That is excellent customer service and she did well to remember my face, as well as another customer's whose order she delivered to their waiting car.",

But 6 minutes later we were seated. Had the Eggs & Thick Cut Bacon combo... Sub'd regular pancakes for blueberry pancakes and a side order of grits.   The applewood bacon is ADDICTIVELY delicious! Grits were plain. Eggs were ok. And blueberry pancakes great!  They do pack people in kind of tight at the tables.  You're sitting there elbows length of people near you. It's so close you can hear each other's conversation. Even thought it may take a little longer, for privacy and comfort, request a booth.  I like the fact that a good portion of the staff was there from the last time I was was there. Generally when see the same faces over a course of months to a year, that lets you know something positive about the establishment. Parking is also a issue with their small lot. It seems every time I go, there is this competitive and aggressive atmosphere to obtain a parking spot.",

The pancakes are always made to order, way more food than you can eat and the variety of toppings is endless.

They had a packed house but our wait for seats was literally only about 5-10 minutes. They are really quick at getting people in and out. It helps that you don't have to wait for the waiter to bring your card/money back; you just walk up to the front register and pay there.  The food is amazing. Eggs Michael, Eggs Benedict, Blueberry pancakes, literally everything we've tried has yet to let us down. The bacon is AMAZING - thick cut Canadian bacon. They know just how to cook it! The blueberry pancakes come with blueberry compote which is SO good - and the portion sizes are amazing. 6 pancakes for less than 6 bucks! Their omelets are $12 but don't let the price fool you, they are HUGE!   The entire wait staff is fast, efficient and friendly. During our last visit, Charlette was our waitress and she was SO sweet and quick. The girls at the front door and at the register are always great, as well!

    "text": "Overall - this place is okay. We come here when we are craving something sweet. We share the apple pancake (which is such a huge portion that we typically take a lot of it home with us). My fiance got two eggs and bacon, as well. He said it was good but we were charged $8 for the eggs and bacon, which is pretty steep. I ordered some potato pancakes which were good on flavor but super dry - they fell apart into crumbles when we tried to eat them. We didn't even ask for a box to take what was left of them with us.   We come to this spot maybe twice a year and I don't see us increasing that. It's okay but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. There are several superior brunch spots in the CLT area that I am more likely to go to.  Note: I appreciated that Karen T. (I am guessing she is the manager of this location) read my review and responded but found her to be somewhat rude in her response. It doesn't matter that this establishment hasn't raised their prices in a few years - that does not change my opinion that some items are overpriced. Also, there was no offer of toast or pancakes with my fiance's eggs and bacon. One of my pet peeves is when businesses don't welcome the feedback of customers and her defensive response makes me feel even more confident about my two star rating.",

Once you enter, you realize it's not for the ambience, as the interior is unmemorable with dated food photos on the walls and tables packed into every inch of floorspace. But if you ask this girl, Original Pancake House, or \"O-HOP\" as my friends and I have always called it, is all about the food and is definitely worth the wait!  I feel like you can always tell the quality of a breakfast spot by the coffee. And O-HOP has great coffee!

Both my boyfriend and I were feeling adventurous that day, and the risks paid off big time. He ordered the Apple Cinnamon Nut French Toast. Before long a heaping plate arrived with large pieces of French bread, coated in almonds, with gobs of REAL whipped cream and homemade apple nectar syrup. I would have been jealous, except I ordered the Apple Pancake at the suggestion of our waitress, and that pancake was the star of the show.  O-HOP's Apple Pancakes reportedly take an hour to make, but they have one cooking during brunch at all times because it's always being ordered so it is not an extra wait. Even if it were, again, it would be worth it! The Apple Pancake is a soft baked pillow of deliciousness, coated in thinly-sliced, sweet and tart Granny Smith apples that have been caramelized and glazed in cinnamon and sugar. I wish I had the words to better describe this extraordinary experience. This is a CAN'T MISS DISH!  All of O-HOP's items are cooked with clarified butter (ghee) and peanut oil. They use real preserves. Batters are made from scratch, and some mixes take days to develop. It's a True testament to the importance of details, because their food is truly divine. Don't let the ho-hum digs fool you, Original Pancake House  is a real diamond in the rough.",

I ordered the waffle with strawberry. My friend had pecan pancakes and an omelet. She liked everything. I was excited to see fresh strawberries. I've learned not to take such things for granted. The whipped cream wasn't fluffy enough for me. I think it was home made. I like it out of the can better, as it was also too sweet. Almost taste like iced cream. Nevertheless, the waffle was great and I was about to eat about 3/4 of it before getting full. I also had bacon. It had a good taste, but was too thick for my liking. Overall, this is a good place with good service. It's very busy, but they do a good job moving things along.",

I had the Western Omelette and the hubby had bacon & eggs with pancakes and pork links. My omelette was huge, but it was so fluffy and delicious that I ate every bite.

Turned out to be an overhyped Waffle House in my opinion. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated, then ordered drinks. Our server, Jessica I believe, was great. She was very attentive and timely, always checking to make sure we were ok and didn't need anything.   I ordered a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with a side of hash browns. Not especially terrible, just extremely bland. The hash browns tasted like cardboard, so they were subsequently drowned in ketchup. The sandwich wasn't bad, but again the eggs lacked much flavor.   For the price I guess I can't complain too much, but I would rather spend an extra $5-$10 and have my socks blown off at a brunch spot somewhere.",

I used to travel full time for my job so I've been to several locations across the country; Chicago, Southfield (MI) Toledo, San Diego, Dallas, Atlanta, Aventura (FL), Ft. Lauderdale, Miami, Jacksonville and my hands down favorite Boca Raton!    I've been ordering the same thing for all these years, bacon and eggs with pancakes.  Now these pancakes aren't your ordinary tasting pancakes.  They melt in your mouth and every time you take a bite a slight moan of delight escapes your lips.    Although the portion sizes may vary from one location to the next (The Boca Raton location is my fav because the pancakes were the size of a large plate!) but the pancakes always taste the same.  The prices are a bit higher than typical breakfast spots like IHOP and Denny's but trust me it's well worth it.  Hey, don't take my word, try it for yourself and you will definitely become a believer.  You won't look at any other pancake the same!",

Fatty texture but not even a little butter or lemon flavor in that mother of all breakfast indulgences. Burnt, dry, microwave tasting omelettes, puffed and brown. Freezer-flavored hash browns with no crisp to them whatsoever.   Basically, the best argument towards anti-corpo food that I've eaten in a long, long while.   It hurt pretty bad, as I used to frequent this chain constantly as a kid - the Kosher made my gma+gpa happy, dad went for the apple pancake, week in, week out. Smoked salmon, potato pancakes, it was all delish. And strawberry pancakes, with fresh whipped cream, were totally my jam.  This new thing sporting the same name is like the OPH I remember but nightmarishly riffing off the nastiest of Denny's. Potato pancakes thin like paper, eerily tasting of potato, floppy and gummy. Sour cream in tiny, spit-cup sized containers. Watered down applesauce.   No thanks.",

They have a good menu with many options, baked pancakes, gourmet pancakes, waffles, omelets etc.  I had eggs, hash browns and pancakes.  The eggs were fine, the hash browns were country style and the pancakes looked fluffy, but they ate dense and slightly chewy.  The syrup was very sugary, too much so, that it had that no-sugar added kind of taste, where they overcompensate with sweetness.  I miss real maple taste.

Waiter waif he would get them.  After 10 minutes and food getting cold, my husband got up and got them from serving station.  Half way through meal, server comes back and states they were dirty utensils!!!! Needless to say, it was a horrible experience!!!!!",

It was our first visit and looking at the menu we thought the prices were a little bit high, until we saw the plates come out. A good value for the dollar.  I had the limited time meat omelette.  The eggs it was made of were light and fluffy and was packed full of meat and cheese.  The pancakes were much better than the dense ones served at some other pancake places.  I highly recommend the warm strawberry syrup with the buttermilk pancakes.  Tasted like strawberry shortcake.",

I ordered an omelet as they all come with 3 pancakes (so can't go wrong with that). Omelet was huge and pancakes delicious with a variety of syrups to match. We also had a blueberry compote waffle and enjoyed it. My only complaint was we were seated by kitchen which was very loud and very busy. Almost hard to even hear conversation. Overall, good food and experience. We'll be back.",

I'm sorry but $2.99 for a large orange juice with no refills is a bad start. I know plenty of restaurants like this but then on top of that the Eggs Benedict was HORRIBLE! Taste like egg yolks. Now mind you the hollandaise sauce is mostly egg yolk but it shouldn't taste like it, especially with poached eggs. It was really small and should come with some roasted potatoes. I got the buttermilk pancakes instead of the potato cakes. Considering its a pancake house, they're pretty good... With some strawberries and syrup, it's JUMPIN! So if you come here... just get what it's known for... pancakes.",

We were promptly seated and our waitress quickly took our drink orders giving us time to peruse the menu. My father-in-law ordered sausage patties, scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes. I ordered thick sliced bacon, scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes. The food arrived very quickly and piping hot. Everything was delicious! I could have sat there and eaten bacon until closing!  My only drawback is...I'm not a fan of warm syrup because it becomes to watery. However, if you like warm syrup, this is a great breakfast spot. The next time I'm in Charlotte, I will be returning.

    "text": "Husband and I ventured here one rainy weekend morning when the wait at our favorite neighborhood breakfast joint, Toast of Dilworth, seemed too long to bear. Afterward, I'd wished we had waited - though OPH was by no means BAD. It just wasn't of comparable quality, ambiance or service.  My veggie omelet and pancake sides were served hot. The omelet was bursting with veggies and - is it possible? - too much cheese. Husband's bacon, eggs & pancakes were also good - the bacon seemed impossibly long, and was truly thick-cut as advertised. Everything was cooked to order, but had that industrial air where you know things like the omelets come from premixed, cartoned egg 'batter'. Not bad, just not quite what we prefer. Syrup wasn't real maple, just your usual IHOP-y Aunt Butterworth approximation.   The setting is also a bit industrial, feeling a bit like a former garage or hanger of some kind. Seats are tightly packed in, so you end up a bit closer to your dining neighbors than we usually prefer.   There was a long wait when we arrived, which I get the feeling is pretty typical here, but they at least moved steadily - if not ultra-quickly -  through the wait list.   I'm not sure if we'd visit OPH again when we have such stellar competition closer to home, but I'm glad we tried it, at least once.",

It really does blow all those other huge chains away that seem to enter a city and devour the competition.  No, OPH really is a cut above the rest. The pancakes are naturally on-point with a great variety. Hence the time of year I had to try the pumpkin pancakes - which I've been a fan of before they became famous the nationwide.  I even some simple scrambled eggs to add and they were quite tasty.   The staff was also very nice, even better than before.  Next time in Charlotte this will once again be my first stop-over.",

The service was amazing and very attentive. My girl was craving eggs Benedict and all the reviews said it was the best..... and they were one hundred percent right!!! They even brought out extra hollandaise sauce and hash browns for us and didn't even charge us for it!!!! I got the steak and eggs which is my go to breakfast and they nailed it!!!!!! perfectly seasoned and cooked steak!!! And to make the meal even better where most places give you toast with your meal I got three fluffy buttermilk pancakes.

She was friendly and quick even as she was showing a newbie the ropes. I've never seen someone carry so many plates with such grace and speed .It's great to see the original pancake house takes the time to onboard their new employees and train them properly while still being able to provide excellent service. My blueberry pancakes were to die for and all my food arrived hot and looking like an Instagram photo. Just had to share my great experience !",

There are plenty of items on the menu for people to choose from which is great. The omlettes are HUGE! And this is not an understatement either. Two or three people can probably share it and it would be enough.   If you want to try a great b-fast place other than IHOP or Denny's...come here and you will not be disappointed",

It's also just a really great spot to come and eat. They have a huge menu and they do everything well. I love getting the Chorizo omelette with egg whites and gluten free pancakes (yep, I'm *that* person at the table -- and they never seem to mind my finicky ordering!) My husband loves the Grilled Chicken and Spinach omelette.   The coffee is good, the service is impeccable. They move a TON of people in and out of this place every morning. And the omelettes are HUGE. It is seriously difficult to leave this place hungry.   As an example of the impeccable service, last time we were there my omelette accidentally got made with regular eggs instead of egg whites. Our server recognized it before serving to us and offered me free hash browns to nibble on while I waited for them to remake my omelette (which only took a few minutes.) It was a really nice touch.",

It's also that mix of savory and sweet that makes breakfast my fav.  The Original Pancake House is great... I had been avoiding it due to the large crowds and waiting time it draws on the weekends, but it is definitely worth the wait.  Or if you can finagle an \"off\" time to beat the crowds, it's just a great thing.  They open up at 6:30am on weekdays and if you plan accordingly, you can start your day off just right.  Pretty much any breakfast staple is good here.  I'm probably 99.96% sure I will always get a Benedict.  Staffers here are super nice and the servers are quick to refill your coffee.  Definitely leave satisfied every time.  The trick to this midtown location is that it has a small parking lot.  With the addition of the new apartments next door, parking is definitely a challenge, but doable.  I would recommend walking if you live near the area.  As an added bonus, you can go right from breakfast into the ABC store next door.",

I used to eat them growing up so it's definitely a must try for me and they did not disappoint because they were delicious.  The other neat thing is that their corned beef hash is homemade not from the can my friends! So pay a little extra for that premium meat and you won't be sad.

I was not expecting to get my food that fast. Usually when food comes out fast there is something wrong with it. But that's not the case with the food here. They even butter the toast for you, it's crazy. I don't know what this syrup is but it just makes everything taste amazing. They cooked the eggs the best they could with the balance of cheese on it. The Belgian waffle was smaller than I was expecting but just as filling as any other one. The waitress checked on me often and it was impressive considering how busy she was. I am definitely coming back here every chance I get for a breakfast on a free day.",

I had the Spanish omelette and I substituted toast for the pancakes. My companion had eggs and banana nut pancakes.  Y'all, that was one great omelette. It was massive. Very fluffy and filled to the brim with mushrooms, chorizo, cheese, and all sorts of other goodies. It came with a Spanish sauce on the side that was so good, I took some home. If I could figure out how to make that at home, I'd be in heaven. Instead, looks like another trip to OPH is on the agenda soon. Oh, and by the way, the coffee and banana nut pancakes were delicious as well!!",

This is by far the best 'chain' to go to in town, but go to the one in South Park.  The people that work here are incompetent and I am not just reviewing one occasion.  Every time I go, whether I eat there or take it to go, they screw something up or are just plain slow.  And there's something off with the vibe of this place.  It doesn't feel comfortable like the other restaurant.  I only go to this one because it's closer.  If I'm out, I head over to the other one.  I even think the food is fresher at the other one.  5 stars for the one in South Park though.  **Update** Again they screwed something up.  How do you forget to give a person butter for pancakes and then, after reminding them 3 times that you need butter, still manage to never get it?",

I would avoid anything with \"tropical syrup\".....it tastes like pure sugar with a little imitation tropical flavoring thrown in.  Yuck!

I've only ever really gone after a night of drinking since I live nearly across the street from this location. The food is typically very average, it would be good cheap food, but the quality doesn't really reflect the price. Just a bit more than I care to pay for poor service and mediocre food.   The service is typically pretty poor. The waiter/waitress will disappear once you get your food without checking in on the table. I've had servers completely forget to bring the drinks that were ordered. Once I was delivered the wrong food, which meant for another table.  Recently, my credit card company emailed me telling me that I left a $50 tip on a $10 meal. So someone on the staff tried to change the tip I had left, which is generally just disappointing. But I guess it is an Original Pancake House and I can't really expect much more, so I'm just happy I have a good credit card company to warn me about these kind of issues.",

I deducted 1 star because parking is kind of difficult on busy days.

Its a perfect brunch place for a Sunday or a weekend, at least to us.   It is no news that their pancakes are to die for.  Super soft, super fluffy and super flavorful, especially with their homemade maple syrup and fresh cream and fruit toppings.  We have tried most of their pancakes and loved them all.  In our recent visit I order a french toast, its a cinnamon nut French toast with sauteed apples and fresh cream and WOW was it good.  Felt like IT was the answer to my Sunday brunch craving loaded with carbs and no protein lol. 4 loafs of bread generously drenched in eggs and seared, topped with enough cinnamon (which I love) and pecan and roasted almonds and a huge dollop of super fresh cream.  Loved the fresh cream because it is not too sweet and smells super fresh.   Wife's egg benedicts was just awesome (that's what she said).  English muffin, a thick layer of Canadian bacon and poached egg topped with hollandaise and you get two of these in an order with pancakes.  this is always a go-to place for us, rings in mind by default when we crave for Sunday brunch.  Even though we know we have to wait for a while to get a table, we still go here, wait outside, bear the hunger, scream at each other as it was their fault to choose this place, keep silent for a while, anxiously check our mobile phones, eagerly waiting to hear those words from the front desk \" Dee, party of 2 \" and everything changes. :)",

I came in with a couple friends on a Sunday around noon and, surprisingly, we didn't have to wait that long to get seated even though there were so many people. The menu was extensive and had a wide array of breakfast favorites.   One of my friends spoke highly of the omelettes, so I decided to try one. From the many delectable options, I ended up getting the Chorizo Omelette. The omelettes here are not your ordinary omelettes. These huge and fluffy egg delights are perfectly prepared and super cheesy (which is important). As an egg-slut, excitement ran through me as soon as this King-size pillow of an omelette hit the table. And it doesn't end there. All of the egg plates come with 3 excellent buttermilk pancakes. I love pancakes, so that's winning... Two Times.   Overall, the service was great and the food was excellent. This is definitely a place I want to return to on my next trip to Charlotte.",

    "text": "This place is awesome!!!! This was my very first time eating here so I had high expectations. I ordered the fresh strawberry pancakes with eggs and thick sliced bacon. I substituted the eggs for grits because I don't like restaurant eggs unless it's omelet style. The pancakes were VERY good and fluffy and has a quality taste to it unlike ihop where to me the pancakes just aren't great. They also use REAL strawberries (not that ihop preserve strawberries). One thing I did not like and I found out when I got my bill was the added strawberries were apparently $2.75 which is ridiculous to me. The grits were nothing special, the bacon was perfect. My little sister got the 3 pigs in a blanket and those were pretty good also.   On Sunday's expect a wait time of about 15-20 min since they close at 3 and everyone is leaving church. But once seated the food came fairly fast. Also finding a parking space can be hard. I'll definitely be coming back here again to try a different platter though!",

    "text": "This place has all the elements you'd expect would make a wonderful establishment, but somehow it falls short.  First, the menu is expansive. Anything you could ever imagine you'd like from a place with \"pancakes\" in the name, plus specials. There are dozens of planned dishes, but if none of those make your skirt fly up, you can create your own breakfast from the menu of side dishes.   The service is great, but also along the lines of what you'd expect from a diner. There's no way you're eating here without some sort of endearing acknowledgement -- our server called every female \"young lady.\"   There's no ambiance here -- none. The high ceilings make it feel very industrial, and the fluorescent lights give the place a clinical vibe. I wouldn't dare complain about that, though; if the food is great, I'll eat it in a shack. The food is always the most important part.  The food, though, is disappointing. I ordered a simple midday breakfast of corned beef hash and eggs with a side of grits and not one part of my meal was worth writing home about. My \"over medium\" eggs were far undercooked. Not just runny whites, either -- I'm talking about whites that were still clear and snotty. As in completely raw. My corned beef hash was cold and unproportionally heavy on the onion. And my grits were flavorless, even after adding whipped butter I stole from my companion's french toast.  I know, I know, breakfast isn't supposed to be five star, chef-inspired cuisine. But if I'm ordering eggs (and paying $10), I expect them to be, you know, cooked. My bar is set very low, and OPH couldn't reach it.",

It was an excellent experience because the food was delicious, service wasn't anything special, but it was immediate when we sat down. And the price was fair! I cannot wait to come back here.  There was a long wait before we were seated, but it was worth it. We waited about 45 minutes to an hour, and then were seated at a clean table. Service was friendly and actually quick. The menu is expansive and reminds me of a cross breed of IHOP and Waffle House.  The only part that was tough was the parking. I almost gave up on parking here and going here, but there were cars moving right when we arrived and we lucked up!",

Came in on a Wednesday morning around 10 am and got seated immediately though there was a short wait right after us. We got seated at a two top table that felt like a 4 top with how close we were to the people beside us.  The waitress was nice and as attentive as you can be with a packed house. She did forget I ordered my drink but by the time the food came I just decided to stay with water. The menu seemed standard but looking at others plates I can see that they have some unique staples that surely keep bring people back. We kept it pretty basic with eggs, country ham, French toast and  blueberry pancakes. Food came quick and hot. Everything was delicious and nicely portioned especially for the price! I love country ham and gave me a huge piece of it. I also ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes, please share with somebody, it was a lot!  I just always thought this place was similar to ihop but it's so much better, like a big diner feel to it. Can't wait to go back and try more.",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped in here around 8am on a Sunday morning.  I started with a cup of coffee and ordered corned beef hash with an extra egg (for a total of 3) over easy and rye toast.  She ordered the vegetarian omelette with the default pancakes on the side.  I have to start with the coffee.  For what is ostensibly a diner, the coffee's got to be good.  This coffee was not.  I'm not sure if it had been sitting in a heated carafe for too long, but it was extremely acidic.  If I wasn't so tired, I'd have gotten something else to drink.  I'm not terribly picky about my coffee as long as it tastes like coffee and has caffeine, but this was just bad.  The food was disappointing.  The corned beef hash wasn't really a hash...it didn't really have any identifiable pieces of potato or onion.  It was a monochrome dark pink color with little texture.  Slop, even.  Regardless of its content, it would have been a lot better if it had some extra time on the griddle, allowing a nice crust to form.  No such luck.  It was mushy, VERY salty even for corned beef hash, and just not that great.  My rye toast was undertoasted.  Only one side of one of the four pieces had any appreciable color to it.  The butter served alongside my wife's waffles didn't even melt, meaning it had been sitting for a bit and got cold, so they definitely had some extra time they could have used to toast it more deeply.  The eggs were perfectly cooked with warm runny yolks.  The whites themselves were completely pale white with no browning, but I won't hold that against them since I didn't ask for crispy whites or anything.  My wife enjoyed her omelette, though it had what must have been four ounces of cheese in it.  Way too much, and I love cheese, but some people must like that.  Her pancakes, however, were undercooked.  I tried a few bites and they definitely had uncooked batter in the center.  Really disappointing, for a restaurant with \"pancake\" in its name.  Service was fine, but I don't think we'd come back.",

He saw that I was waiting for a table and he immediately stepped in and helped out. Plus, my waiter was so sweet.  But.... For the 45 minutes we sat there, there were 3 different mix ups. I did not order fruit and was brought fruit. We asked for mustard but was brought whipped cream. We did not ask for jams but brought out jams. I think they could have done a better job of remember which table it is, the logistics is very messed up here. It really ruins the experience makes you feel like you are just another diner. Needs to do a better job of personalizing if you want to be a True competitor to iHop.   Also, the pancakes I had were very dry.",

    "text": "After 3 years of driving by this place and smelling it on walks I finally ate here! I went on a Sunday at 9:30 and had a 15 minute wait. The entrance is a bit strange as you walk into basically a small box with a bench.   Inside is better but also lacks some excitement and decoration. But who cares right? Let's get to the food review.  I ordered \"three pigs in a blanket\" and a side of hash browns. They were everything I dreamed of. Three sausages wrapped in pancakes. The pancakes are perfect and so were the sausages. I put a little maple syrup on there and it was delightful and very filling. The hash browns are perfectly flavored. They're more like house fries but no matter what they're called, they're delicious. My friend ordered the blueberry pancakes and some Canadian bacon. He loved both but raved about the Canadian bacon.  The service is very quick but our server was not friendly and gave us the bill before we were halfway done. After we had put the food in the to go box she started giving us the evil eye to get out. As a former server, I get it, the faster a table leaves, the faster you make more tips. But we had been there less than 30 minutes so like, chill. I want to enjoy my coffee!",

Not the standard American flat pancake, this mound of egg texture-ish flour and apple cinnamon mixture was a force. Mixed with a topping of the side syrup I had to take it to go.   Family friendly restaurant. We were traveling with a toddler and despite the hustle and bustle of this busy local favorite, they were kind and engaging with our kiddo.  This is a busy place and we visited on a weekday before the lunch time rush.  The kitchen was busy and the staff was keeping pace.  We did not wait but the location seems to welcome larger groups.  Please keep that in mind when planning your visit.",

Update: not True, they came in and added their names to the list after I did. I stood inside for 10 minutes then went and sat outside on the bench where your staff claimed they came outside and called me...want to know what they had on and looked like? I can provide that information to if you like. Text messages are timed stamped, the text came through after I had left the restaurant while the me and I were on the phone. Total time for the wait, time in the conversation and time I traveled down the road was a bit over an hour. You screwed up. I didn't want your food after the treatment, what I wanted was equal customer service from the beginning.",

Midnight Diner was our original choice, however, we couldn't wait in their line because we were pressed for time. So we stopped in Original Pancake House. We were seated with 10 minutes by the hostess who called our name over the speaker. We heard it standing outside in front. We were seated and our waitress was there to take our order as soon as we sat down. We asked for a few more minutes, and after looking at the heavy looking pancakes at the table next to us, we knew we would go with waffles instead. We ordered the bacon plate, our food came out quickly and man that bacon is stuff dreams are made of!! It is sooooooo goood!! Nice and thick and cooked to a nice crisp. The Waffles however, tasted just like the pancakes looked, heavy. The batter just wasn't good at all. If I ever returned, it'd be for the bacon.",

    "text": "Breakfast is my favorite meal.  When I want something extravagant I usually do that at home.  When I eat breakfast away from home, I usually want some combination of eggs and potatoes with a side of something good and porky.  Depends on the mood.  I'm a waffle french toast kinda girl.  Never been big on pancakes.    I dropped in on a Wednesday @ 10.  Got a great park, no waiting, hostess was friendly.  Decor will not blow you away.  It is rather plain and utilitarian.  I actually like that.  I was seated under a tv.  I chose not to switch sides to see it better.  I came to eat.  Today was a day to enjoy my own company, not something you see people do much anymore.  No phone out looking busy and engrossed in some other thing.  Just me.  I'm a sucker for Benedicts and got lured into ordering the eggs Michael.  A house favorite.  Like a benedict but with sausage and a sherry mushroom sauce, comes with potato pancakes.  Sounds yummy.  Had my coffee and was anxious to see the big deal.  It seemed to take longer than it should.  I think my server was distracted.  It did give me time to appreciate the coffee.  It was VERY good.  I don't even drink IHOP coffee anymore.  But this was really good. I loved the mug you got that made it feel like your home.  The cream in the little pitcher reminded me of my childhood tea set.  Nice.  I have to say, and this is a complete digression; what happened to the pouring sugar?  Maybe that's why I love a dive so.  I don't open fifty million packs of sugar at home when I drink coffee.  Yes, I'm embellishing but it's annoying. I swear sugar packs are not as sweet as sugar in bulk.  Give the people what they want: convenience without judgement.  Finally, my food arrives. (Insert sigh here). The potato pancakes came with a little sour cream and applesauce.  I don't get the applesauce but anyway.  They were light and delicate. Seasoned nicely. Tasty.  The other?  Eggs were poached a little over, not a crime, sausage was not dry and muffin was toasted lightly.  It was the sauce that ruined it.  I tried but couldn't take another bite.  I wasn't expecting a Hollandaise, just something equally delicious.  It was bad, to me.  The color was beige like, the texture was...like some kind of coating or gravy.  I didn't expect fresh mushrooms but I really wanted to like it. I could not.  I called my server over and got a regulation Benedict to replace it.  That came out much quicker.  But...I knew I wouldn't really enjoy this one either.  AND I knew why.  The sauce. It's packaged.  They had identical textures and seasonings were very artificial in that instant packet kinda way.  One hinted at lemon the other at I'll say sherry.  Since I'd finished most of my first order of potato pancakes I ate as much as I could.  It was not unbearable, just disappointing. I own this one. Taste is subjective.  I get that.  The guy sitting directly across from me ordered a side of the sherry sauce for his omelet. I was astounded.  I can understand how some people can love something while others do not.  I'll be back.  I'll pick my eggs more carefully next time.  I want to have a Yay! I'm a fan kinda relationship with a pretty decent breakfast stop.",

    "text": "The Original Pancake House (OPH) is my 2nd favorite place for breakfast on the weekends (Pewter Rose is the first).  And they're one of the few Charlotte brunch options that opens before 10 a.m.  They offer an extensive menu of breakfast selections, including eggs, waffles, and, of course, pancakes.    Since I'm usually an egg person for breakfast, I'm usually steered past the pancakes and waffles and go right for the omelettes or other egg dishes.  Their omelettes are HUGE.  They seem like they're made from like 18 eggs or something.  None of the omelettes really seem to have a lot inside them (the ingredients aren't overflowing), but my favorite is the sausage one.  Also tasty are their seafood crepes and Eggs Michael (Eggs Benedict with sausage instead of Canadian bacon), as well as their regular Eggs Benedict.  And, last but not least, there's the Kosher meal:  eggs with salami and potato pancakes on the side.  YUM!  I'm not Jewish, but I do love a good Kosher breakfast!  (Miami has an awesome Jewish breakfast place, too, but I draw the line at \"tongue.\")  Potato pancakes are a delicious treat -- more tasty than hashbrowns, but not as filling as regular pancakes.    This location of the OPH is fairly new (in the past couple of years).  They moved from South Blvd where there was little parking...to a place where there's even less.  Go figure.  And I'm not crazy about the big open space of the \"new\" restaurant.  I want OPH to feel more like a diner.  I guess that's part of my reasoning for only 4 stars instead of 5.    If you go on Sundays, be sure to get there before the church crowd!  Or you're looking at about an hour wait.",

I can't complain about how my Denver omelette was cooked, but the only thing I tasted was the salt and hot sauce I added. The peppers, ham, onion and cheese were merely textural additions to the pale fluffy eggs. My friend's eggs Benedict is what inspired this review and how I knew the level of cooks was sub par. Aside from the crappy English muffins and Canadian bacon one of his poached eggs was half gone, just a piece of egg white, covered in a broken hollandaise. \"Broken\" meaning the butter didn't emulsify with the eggs. Instead of a rich buttery sauce, it was greasy with clumps of overcooked egg. Yuck. Who let that slide??",

Our server was absolutely wonderful as well.  We had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and homefries between us.  The homefries were awesome.  In general, all of the pancakes are incredible, bacon is thick cut and delicious, and orange juice is fresh squeezed. Also worth trying crepes or the dutch baby if you're willing to wait for it.  Always an incredible experience, although not the cheapest.",

Whether you're in the mood for one of their signature pancake dishes, an omelet, or their unbeatable Belgian waffles, you won't be disappointed.

The Midtown location in particular, is THE spot to see and BE seen by Charlotte's business and political crowd.

I shouldn't be so picky though, because the menu here is huge, lots to choose from! And decently priced.  The omelettes at OHP are out of control huge! First time we ordered them my boyfriend and I looked at each other, open mouths in shock, at their enormous size! I actually prefer my omelettes a little thinner, but I'm always impressed at how thick these are, but still light, fluffy and not overcooked. You're definitely getting your money's worth if  you order one of these. I would recommend the vegetarian or Spanish.  I totally dig the crepes here.  My boyfriend does not agree, claims they are too eggy... but I think they're perfect and delish. The Crepe Florentine is the best, Hollandaise sauce... mmm. Comes with 4 little potato pancakes. I really like the flavor of these, but they are too thin (leaving me wanting 4 times as many!)  Coffee is good, but no necessarily my favorite cup in Charlotte.   The wait staff and always super sweet.  The biggest CON at OHP is that you will most definitely have to wait for a table on the weekend (15+ minutes). The good thing is that there's a nice view of the city from the patio/waiting area. AND the kitchen moves their food super fast so the table turnover is quite quick (don't be intimidated by the amount of other people you see waiting!)  FYI: there's a BOGO coupon in the Charlotte Citipass book for OPH.",

If you're looking for the best most filling breakfast out there, I'd recommend the apple Pancake. It's less of a pancake and more of an apple pie. The flavors are incredible and you will undoubtedly have leftovers. Now if you're not looking for dessert for breakfast, my go to ate the  49ers. Very thin, chewy pancakes. Amazing.   Beware of the wait on weekends. You're usually looking at 30-60 minutes on average, and usually greater than that Sunday after church.",

I've been to this place four times, and I've tried different pancakes each time.  Only one, thus far, has disappointed me, although I think they may have brought us the wrong pancakes.  I have to say, I especially love the yeasty old buckwheat pancakes (which I'm still not entirely convinced you should put the words \"yeasty\" and \"old\" next to each other on a food menu) and the sourdough pancakes.  Their regular coffee is just ok (pretty standard diner-style), but they do offer french press coffee there (I've not tried it, but one of these days I will).  Their egg and side offers are pretty generous as well.  More food for a better price than IHOP or Waffle House, I think.  This is my favorite breakfast place...or anytime I want breakfast-for-lunch or for-dinner place!",

    "text": "Heard this was a must stop place for breakfast while in Charlotte for a friends birthday & based on food they would have gotten 5 stars , the reason for 3 is the guy that handles reservations was having a off day I guess lol .   I made reservations from the yelp app witch is so cool you can do that we arrived & I checked in at the post where the waiter was , maybe 3 mins later my phone goes off saying our table was ready so I go to the guy & tell him & he's like oh well I got that by accident it's not ready yet . Ok cool so we go back outside to sit amongst about 30 other people who where waiting to be seated & were waiting n waiting the outside is getting empty so I go back to check like is out table ready yet . This guy had the nerve to say I accidentally took you off the list when I checked you in .  At this point I'm trying to remain calm because we waited almost a hour in the hot sun when he should have told me this before I walked away after checking for the second time I guess he was just going to let us sit outside and not say anything . So I ask to be added back on & at this point I'm ready to see a manager to be seated because outside is a whole new set of people , everyone we waited with were already inside and ordering .   I have him another chance to get this situation right , we sat outside another 5 mins before my name was called for seating .  Now to the food it was pretty good food & our waitress was great . The food did take a while to come out but the restaurant was packed so I expected this . I'll definitely come back when in the city",

They have several locations throughout the country and 2 in the Charlotte area.  I had a western omelette that came with 3 pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy and the omelet was made to perfection and really can be split between 2 people. Definitely try the blueberry or banana pancakes you definitely won't be disappointed.",

It is perfect for sharing. I like how you can customize anything to your liking and the portion sizes are great for the price. The staff is always extremely friendly and attentive. I have gotten a few other things besides the pancakes and omelettes but I feel as those are the best options on the menu. I never got a Benedict, but they look good. There is usually a wait on the weekends, so I suggest using Yelp to reserve your spot beforehand.",

They have a Cajun chicken sandwich that's great and the buckwheat pancake taste like momma made them. The grapefruit juice is crisp and tart.

That almost always guarantees a parking spot and no wait.  My absolute favorite thing here are the pecan pancakes with powdered sugar. I'm always a little disappointed to eat the lower most pancake of the stack since it has little or no powdered sugar. I hope they will remedy that some day. Their waffles are good as well, but I don't remember what kind I had ordered. Most likely pecan waffles.  I have tried their omelets before which are decent. The fajita crepes are pretty good, but the potato pancakes are not quite the way we've had them before. What particularly annoys me is their coffee. It is substandard, almost watery, every time we go here, but still somehow costs more than a tall coffee at Starbucks. Every time I realize this and decide I won't order coffee here next time and yet every time I forget it and order it again. Good thing my boyfriend has a habit of checking my Yelp reviews before we go to a place to see what we like and what we don't, so now that I have mentioned that, hopefully I won't be ordering any more coffee here.",

We enjoyed their corn beef hash which is made fresh. I had the western omelette which was really good. I like the way they whip and fluff up the eggs.  The service was polite and efficient.",

We ordered pancakes bacon and sausage links that were so tasty and yummy.  We needed a good meal before heading home & this hit the spot.  The staff is also very kind and professional, True southern hospitality!  Do order the Georgia pecan pancakes, they are amazing!  We will understand why there are crowds waiting to go in to eat.",

    "text": "This is a great classic breakfast diner experience. Any kind of a million pancake options along with crepes, French toast, everything plain or extravagant as you want it. I like that the side is often potato pancakes instead of hash browns- what a fun option! I came here because I had been brought up on Dutch Baby pancakes in Chicago and never see that on a menu. The staff is friendly in classic diner style.. My Dutch baby is right on the money!!! Exactly as I remember! Folks, if you try this, and you should, it's NOT A PANCAKE.. don't say it's too eggy or undercooked because it is a Dutch baby and how it's supposed to be. The middle becomes about a custard and the outer more cooked part is a beautiful light fluffy dough. I get it plain, it only needs maybe extra powdered sugar but nothing more. My son got a fajita crepe which was huge but, almost too huge.. There was so much stuff and filling you couldn't taste the crepe. What I do have \"beef\" with is coffee was $2.25????!!!!?? That seems ridiculous to me. So come, have a Dutch baby but just get water!",

We ordered their Swedish pancakes and meat lover's omelette ( which came with 3 buttermilk pancakes)..   The Swedish pancakes were unlike the regular pancakes.. These were more on the lines of crepes (not something we like) but this was delicious.. It was served with lingonberry sauce and whipped butter and the combination was divine!  The meat lovers omlette was huge and extremely filling (imagine an omlette made with 4-5 eggs!) The buttermilk pancakes were the best I've ever had.. Unlike the pancakes you usually get at Ihop or other such places! I'd surely go back just to have the pancakes again..   Expect a 15-20 mins wait time if you arrive post 8:30-9:00 AM on weekends!",

I love that they're using the no wait feature on Yelp, so now you can check in and save your spot in line on the drive over! We ended up only waiting about 3 minutes once we got there.   I switched things up this time and ordered the smoked salmon platter. It was really good. Tons of salmon! I split that with my fiance who ordered the pumpkin pancakes (my second favorite after the chocolate chip!). His mom got the banana nut pancakes which were really good too!   For some reason I've always opted out of whipped cream on my pancakes, this time we didn't, and it was life changing!

    "text": "Back today for a late brunch and to celebrate a birthday. The main meals at the Original Pancakes House aren't keto friendly but there are definitely some solid options.  On a Friday afternoon, it was surprisingly busy. Parking lot full and just about every table occupied but we landed at the right time as there was no wait and the kitchen was cooking up quickly.  My wife and my daughter both chose the Dutch Baby which is a large bowl-shaped pancake that is absolutely heavenly and if I wasn't still eating keto, we'd all have ordered them. I recommend getting it without the powdered sugar on it, as it's really not needed. The bowl of strawberries is a good add and ask for extra lemons. Oh so good.  I had the Philly Cheese Steak Omelet which was nicely loaded with cheese, meat, onions and peppers. It's a baked omelet and very fluffy. Delicious and with a little bit of hot sauce, perfect. I skipped the toast and the potatoes that are normally included.  Way better than anything you'd get at the International Hoes of Pancakes. This is great flavor and delicious and I'm glad to update my review!  [Review 11197 overall, 973 of 2019.]",

Let's start with the pancakes, they were good but a little less tasty than I expected. On a scale of 1-10 I would say a 7. The eggs were prepared well and were not over salted. The thick sliced bacon was great, I could have ordered a couple more slices. They also had fairly good coffee, and they kept my cup filled. Being that it was my first visit it was not too bad. The service was excellent! The waitress was friendly and frequently checked in on us. If you are in the area and looking for a solid breakfast spot you can't go wrong.",

The omelette comes with 3 pancakes,  but we substituted for some toast because that is a massive amount of food. But what a deal if you  have a group of people and can enjoy all of that.   All if the food was great.  Their hot sauce options were Tabasco and Texas Pete's- perfect.  Everything was great. Looking forward to returning.",

This place was packed, and I can see why! Fresh food and fast service! I'll most definitely be back! My sister and I both ordered an egg combination, mine with bacon and hers with hash browns. The egg combinations also come with 3 buttermilk pancakes. So much food for a very reasonable price! So happy I found a new quality breakfast spot!",

I had the Junior Platter with a side of grits and it was just enough for me to feel full without being stuffed. I enjoyed everything on my plate.

I try to get something different but I usually end up with my go to the strawberry waffle. Its loaded with fresh berries and they offer a trio of syrups to finish off your waffle. I dont add anything because it's already made perfectly. I did get some scrambled eggs with cheese to round out the meal. The hubby got the banana nut pancakes and they looked amazing. They have mashed bananas mixed in on the batter (which is how he prefers...lucky him) and its topped with pecans. He opted for egg whites and bacon. I should have gotten bacon too because it was good. I really wanted all of his bacon, but I had to restrain myself. He also ordered some freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. It's his favorite and he was excited that it was fresh. Freshly squeezed grapefruit juice is hard to find. Our meal was fantastic as always...I'm sure we will be back.",

The walls were sparse and there's nothing really look at as far as decor goes.   This place makes up for a bland atmosphere by having a delicious amount of options. I had a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with a side of hashbrowns. They let me substitute the bread on my sandwich for a bagle.  The egg wasn't over done and it had a good amount of salt and pepper. My bacon was long and crispy, and the cheese was melty. Their hashbrowns were buttery without being greasy and had the right amount of browning while maintaining a soft interior. They were well seasoned and I didn't need ketchup with them.  Our server kept our drinks full and was friendly and quick when it came to our needs.  So this place is not really date material but worth the stop.",

They have a rather extensive menu with all items priced below $10 with most items falling in between the 6 to 8 dollar range.  I generally prefer savory breakfast items over sweet so on this visit I got an order of the Florentine crepes with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. I'm not exaggerating when I say that their hollandaise sauce is one of the best I've tasted outside of Paris (Paris Hotel in Las Vegas that is). The sauce was smooth and lusciously rich. The mushrooms and spinach inside the crepes were plentiful. My glass of OJ had the right balance of tart and sweetness which was a nice accompaniment to my crepes. It was without a doubt, the best breakfast I had had in awhile.  The restaurant was very busy during our visit so we anticipated that service would be on the slow side. However, our server never appeared frazzled, inpatient, or rude. Service was excellent and served with a smile.    Be aware that unlike their South Park location which closes at 9pm daily, the Midtown location closes at 2:30pm during the weekdays and 3pm on weekends. Get there early because parking is scarce and there tends to be a wait for seating whether it be as short as 10 minutes or as long as an hour. Trust me though, the wait is worth it.",

Nobody ever seems to have these options (pizza joints take note! turkey pepperoni hello!?) I actually had no idea that they even had more than one location besides the one in southpark at least in charlotte anyway. The other morning I woke up and my love asked me what I wanted he said I could have anything I wanted (hes the definition of amazing) I almost yelled pancakes I was so hungry.   This place not only delivered it made me wonder why I hadn't been back in so long! Everything was great the pancakes the turkey sausage the eggs and don't even get me started on their hash browns. Good gawd! I only wish they did a brunch with ya know drinks! But other than that kudos to the food and the great service as well. Definitely wont be waiting so long to return this time.

We got there around 8:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and it wasn't crowded at all... however, it took so long for our waiter to come by that we were about to get up and leave. He finally showed up, and I ordered the banana walnut pancakes with bacon while the fella ordered sausage and eggs over-well.  To be fair, it IS called the Original Pancake House, so sausage and eggs probably aren't the way to go, but the fella got the driest-looking hockey puck sausages I've ever seen. His plate was just sad. My pancakes were good, but they just had a few slices of bananas and walnuts on top - it seemed odd considering most banana pancakes I've had had the bananas already in the batter. The bacon was solid.  As we left, the place was pretty packed, so maybe the service gets better as they get busier? I won't be in a hurry to go back.",

The reason is simple...they have the most unbelievable omelettes.  I've tried to replicate them at home to no avail, so I have to keep coming back.  The baked apple pancake is also a wonder of the world.  It's not the cheapest breakfast in town, and there might be a line to get in, but it general it moves fast, and if you order like I do your breakfast will keep you full all the way to dinner.",

I was an out of town visitor and the convenience to the mall/shopping is great, but the food i could have missed. I LOVE breakfast/brunch and this wasn't a memorable meal. Don't get me wrong, the portion size and prices were decent, but there are better places for breakfast vs waiting an hour or more here.   i did like the fact that they used the wait system that texts you when your food is ready. So we took that time to shop at the local stores in the same shopping center. The service was also great, which is why I gave it an extra star.  WARNING: if you plan to order the one of a kind griddle pancakes, it requires about 25 minutes to bake!",

The menu is huge......we were struggling with what to even get! We ended up settling on splitting the Cheesesteak omelet. The omelets all come with 3 pancakes...... I dont think I could ever eat an entire omelet and 3 pancakes myself! Hence the splitting. We substituted the regular buttermilk pancakes for the pumpkin pancakes (I think it was like a $2 upcharge). Good decision. The omelet was sooooo good. Never had anything like it before....cheesesteak in an omelet! The pumpkin pacakes took the cake though! They were served with this legit whipped cream (yes, I know, awful for you but I lived alittle and had some). Could quite possibly be one of the best pancakes I have ever had!

Restaurants that serve breakfast all day should be given an award for awesomeness. I came here with a friend for brunch during the week and we both ordered the chorizo omelette. With an omelette you get a side of pancakes (3), hashbrowns, or fresh fruit. We decided to upgrade to the pumpkin pancakes and I added pecans to mine. I also had an Earl Grey tea. I don't even really like eggs, but this omelette was delicious. It had chorizo, pork crumbles, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and a ton of cheese. It also came with sour cream and \"Spanish sauce\" which was like a really hearty salsa. The pancakes were served with whipped cream and syrup. I never tasted the nuts which were the only thing I would change.   Be aware of the construction going on around the block that contains the OPH. I passed the entrance 3 times.",

Definitely enough for 2 or more meals.  The fillings (spinach, tomato, broccoli, etc.) were great and the center of the eggs were light and airy and perfect.  Unfortunately, every time I've gotten an omelet here, the outside of the omelet is brown.  That's not great execution.    Also the omelet came with a side of pancakes, which I wasn't expecting.  I guess that was the reason for the $12 price.  It would've been helpful for my diet and willpower to know this in advance so I could tell them not to include.  I'm not sure what part of veggie egg white omelet no cheese extra veggies low oil made them think that pancakes as a side were desirable, but maybe that was my fault for not seeing it on the menu.",

It took a while to get our food-maybe 15 mins - not bad considering how busy they were. Get the hash browns - they are really nicely done with real potatoes, skins and all. Pancakes are amazing too. Dense and flavorful. I got the veggie omelet and it was good but way too big so I took half home. Coffee is strong with a bitter aftertaste. I like it that way but may not be for everyone. We were prepared to wait for a table as the parking lot was jammed and people were streaming in from all over but they seated us in about 2 minutes. The hostess could have been more friendly when checking us in. The building has an open ceiling so all the sounds reverberate making the atmosphere rather noisy during busy times. Next time I might try the Dutch Baby. I remember those being pretty tasty from past visits to the locations in Las Vegas.",

The 3 Pigs in a Blanket were so good that I wish I were eating it right now. I added two eggs to my meal for a few bucks. These were the most freakishly big eggs I've ever seen in my life! The 2 eggs are almost enough for a meal. This was breakfast at a very high level.  +1 Star for having Tabasco and Texas Pete hot sauce.

This was my first experience here, and when we pulled up I was about to pull right back ot of the parkin lot because there were people outside waiting for tables. The couple we were with assured us that this is normal and that they turn the tables over quickly. They were right; after about 10 minutes we were seated.   We've heard great things about the omelettes so that was the first place we looked on the menu. Even better was the fact that you get a short stack with your omelette. I chose the Spanish omelette while most others at the table ordered cheese omelettes, and when all of our orders came out I had immediate food envy. Everyone's omelettes looked like big, giant fluffy egg pillows of deliciousness, and mine was covered with some sort of mystery pasta gravy/salsa hybrid sauce. But I dug in, and it was delicous. The pancakes were soooooo good, and once you add their homemade butter and maple syrup, you have a recipe for 100% breakfast bliss. Eat here. Then go home and pass our for 3 hours, and don't expect to be hungry again until 7pm.",

If you're hungover on a Saturday or Sunday morning, head over to The Original Pancake House to ease your woes.  Their breakfast selection is absolutely huge, anything you can think of to have for breakfast, they have it. From pancakes, to waffles, to omelets, absolutely anything. Not only is every item I've had very good, it's also very filling. They give you very big portions for a pretty decent price. I promise you that the food here will not disappoint & you'll be heading back here again.  The breakfast/brunch crowd is always huge on the weekends, with people always waiting for tables. You may not enjoy your wait, but it's well worth it because you'll leave full & happy, without all those hangover woes.  The Original Pancake House will make you feel like you're eating at a homegrown restaurant, because the food tastes so fresh & homemade. So while it is a great place to catch breakfast/brunch in Charlotte, it is a little disappointing for me. I'd rather go to a local breakfast business to get True freshness in my breakfast. But if you're just looking for a great breakfast, with so many choices to choose from, then The Original Pancake House will definitely impress you & having you coming back again.",

    "text": "I've only been here twice. The first time I wanted to try it because I had seen the long lines out front on the weekends, and the second time because I thought the first was a fluke.   Both times the food was decent--standard breakfast fare with little flair. It was good, don't get me wrong, but didn't seem to justify the long wait.  What was surprising about this place is that the first time I went there the server tried to tell me what to order. I was told that \"complicated\" items take too long and I would be better off getting standard items like eggs or pancakes. I understand that they want to turn over tables quickly with the long wait, but pushing people off of menu items is a big turn-off for me.  The second time I went they were out of the item I wanted. I will try to get back there during the week when it's not as busy and see if my experience is better.",

I had the Eggs Michael - poached eggs over two sausage patties sitting on a toasted english muffin smothered with a delicious mushroom sherry sauce with potato pancakes with apple sauce dressing which were fabulous! The place has a modern industrial design with lots of high windows which makes it nice and bright to wake you up in the morning. The staff was friendly and attentive. I thought the price was reasonable for the amount of food we received. You will not leave hungry! We certainly will be back again. This was the Charlottetowne Ave location!",

I ordered the steak medium it was medium well to well done depending on where you cut it. The home fries were tasteless. Not even ketchup could help them. At least the eggs were cooked correctly and the pancakes were the saving grace. The waiter had no personality and treated everyone like an inconvenience.

    "text": "OMGEEERDD! I have found my new cheap, hungover breakfast/brunch eats! I have been wanting to try this place for a while and I wasn't disappointed with what I found! We arrived around noon, it was packed but, we were seated within a couple of minutes. Our servers were so nice and welcoming, so different from the recurring, unpleasant experiences at IHOP. The entire menu looked good, it was so hard for me to choose. We ended up ordering the western omelette with a side of Bermuda pancakes for an upcharge as well as a fajita crepe. Food was brought out promptly and hot. I LOVED the Bermuda pancakes (3 with the combo and 6 in a full order)! The pecans gave it great texture and the tropical maple syrup had a sweet fruity flavor, almost like passion fruit. The bananas and coconut shavings also provided for a wonderful texture. The western omelette and fajita crepes were very hearty, the crepe was my favorite out of the two. I wasn't a fan of the Spanish sauce that was included in the entrees, it was more like a tomato-y marinara sauce. I think the two of us would have been set between the western omelette - Bermuda pancakes combo, it was a lot of food, will do this next time. The hot chocolate was also delicious and served in their OPH mugs, very cute. And, refills on hot chocolate, score! And and, the hot chocolate and pancakes come with house-made vanilla whipped cream, double score. Egg whites for omelettes come at an additional charge.  We left stuffed with a tone of food to take home. The best experience I've had at a low cost breakfast joint. I will definitely be back, hell, I wish they were open longer so I could go after work. Original Pancake House knows how to work it.",

We had searched a few places on Yelp for brunch, and every place had a 1-2 hour wait except Original Pancake House.... and I don't know why it didn't have a wait!  The service and food were amazing. All the workers were very friendly and helpful. My friend and I both had omelette and a small stack of pancakes, with the hash browns on the side. I had the southwestern? omelette made with egg whites, and it was the FLUFFIEST omelette I've ever had from a restaurant!!!! It was full of cheese and veggies, and the salsa on top was so flavorful, and the omelette was bigger than my head. I had banana walnut chocolate chip pancakes, and they were DELICIOUS! The hash browns were fresh potatoes with onions and seasoning, and they were perfectly cooked. My friend had blueberry pancakes and a vegetarian omelette that she loved as well.   We both paid around 15 dollars each at the end of our meal, which was a huge bargain for the enormous amount of food and coffee. I only wish I can find an Original Pancake house in Virginia now! It's basically a WAY better version of IHOP.   Also, don't forget to try the complimentary sauces and syrups they bring out with the pancakes, the lemon one is delicious!",

The food was good and so was the service.  When I went to check out, I had some gift certificates that were on my email, which was on my phone.  The nice cashier called the manager, Steve, over to take care of me.  He was pretty rude and seemed annoyed by the fact I had the vouchers.  He didn't know anything about them and acted as if they were fabricated.  I didn't say much because I really didn't have the time to argue with him.

Also check your utensils to make sure they're actually clean notice on the picture how dirty this shit is",

The server always came back to check on us and brought all our food in a timely manner. Price wasn't too bad either. We went here for Eid breakfast. We all eat together after prayer, annual tradition.   IHOP is usually super packed so we stopped going there. It was busy but not too bad. It was about 18 of us. The food was great and I usually box up most my food to go but I ate it all.   Fresh and healthy options too. It's a little higher than IHOP but so much better food wise. It was about 220 without tip for all of us. I thought it be a lot more. People ordered a lot of food. Great location too. Will def go back.",

Not sure what the features something called a Dutch Baby made with dough, powdered sugar and lemon.   A stack of three pancakes came with our meals, my husband had corned beef hash and I had a Western omelet. The pancakes distinctly had the taste of lemon in them and we asked the waitress but she said no way just buttermilk. Nah the lemon was overwhelming so I'm guessing it was remnants from a Dutch Baby. The restaurant isn't allergy friendly and I can see how the cross contamination would be a problem.   The western omelet was the fluffiest biggest omelet I have had and it was thick yet light. So yummy, I ate it all! My husband said the corned beef hash was the best he'd ever eaten.   Skip the coffee. We actually asked for fresh pot because it tasted like black sludge leftover at the days end (we got there at 10am after the morning rush so I can understand old coffee). The so called fresh pot tasted like donkey grease. No way no how. Gross. Don't drink it. It probably was donkey grease or the same cup, I hate asking for something to go back to the kitchen.",

I've been to other locations of Original Pancake House before and have always liked it.  I met a friend from another part of town and this location was about halfway.  I got there early and was greeted promptly and got a booth by a window.  Coffee black is how I started.  My friend arrived and I orders 2 eggs, thick bacon (which is spelled out on the menu) and it came with 3 pancakes.  Eggs were good and to be expected.  Bacon was thick as noted.....nothing worse then going out to breakfast and they serve that paper thin crap.  This bacon was as God intended it.  Pancakes were fluffy, lightly sweet and served with whipped butter I LOVE WHIPPED BUTTER, and good syrup.  For like $8.00 it was all good!!!  This location was excellent and the experience was positive.  Only negative was the parking spots were a bit small but other than that everything was A-OK",

But the problem was the same with both locations: parking is awful. There just isn't enough parking for how packed the place gets, and the lot is always a mess of confused drivers.

Our waitress was definitely the best thing about breakfast, she was fast, really friendly, and kept the water and coffee flowing - I think she called each and every one of us 'love' at some point too!    In terms of the food, expect a pretty typical diner-esk experience.  My omelet was huge and I enjoyed it, the pancakes were also really tasty and coupled with the hot syrup made it even better.  My friend got a pecan waffle, it was honestly the smallest, thinnest waffle I have seen served at a diner.  My other friend ordered cheese grits and was really disappointed with them.  Overall it seemed like about half of the food we ordered was good, the other half was rather disappointing.    If you are looking for this place along Charlottetown ave, don't look for a sign out front, it's just a plain looking brick building, with a really jam packed parking lot - so expect to have a tough time getting a spot if its prime time breakfast time!",

I don't know what they do at this particular OPH, but the plain pancakes were amazing.  Definitely craving more today.  Hash browns were okay.  They're more home style with large chunks and kind of soft.  I happen to prefer mine more like Waffle House hashbrowns.  Eggs and sausage links were as expected.  The six year old in our party was a huge fan of the chocolate chip pancakes.  Fortunately he didn't finish all of them so I had the chance to try his.  I concur with his assessment.    There's an overflow parking lot across the street which has reserved spaces for the restaurant.  Expect to use it.",

A: Original Pancake House  Yup, it's a smorgasbord of hungry folks and it's tasty. And yes, it's a chain, but I can't help but express my love for this particular OPH. If you're looking for breakfast, early in the mornin' or late in the afternoon, I highly recommend dropping by here. If you make this particular breakfast run on a Sunday, be prepared to run into a line of hungry folks. But it's ok, really - don't you fear. A very long line absolutely flies into the restaurant in lighting quick speed. I don't know how many cooks OPH has working, but those guys/gals are really, really fast. Thus the tables turn really, really quickly.   No joke, as soon as hubs and I are seated we are out of there in 30-40 minutes at the longest. I usually order the French Crepes - perfectly cooked, delicious, thin crepes stuffed with fresh strawberries accompanied by a side of strawberry sauce. I typically order only two as the regular order comes with three and I just can't handle that much delectable goodness. Make sure you try the turkey sausage too - it's pretty amazing.   If you're more of an omelet fan, OPH makes them the size of footballs. They.are.huge. Oh, and they come with a side of pancakes, so be sure to come hungry. This particular joint is a staple for me as I'm always craving those damn crepes. Thanks, OPH!",

    "text": "I went to this place the day after seeing Wicked with some friends several years ago not realizing I'd actually eaten at another location before a good bit with my sister...in Columbia. I don't normally ever get pancakes, but I read they were good here, so I gave them a try. They were super delicious. The last time I went, (about a year ago) I had one of their (HUGE) omelets. You won't go hungry here, the portions are very big. The place is always packed, but we've always managed to get seated fairly quickly considering the (sometimes) long lines outside and the service is pretty good (orders, coffee refills, etc.). I'll be going back the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Can we talk Original Pancake House for a second? (Of course we can, that's why you are reading this)  OPH is rapidly becoming a Sunday ritual for the roommate and I. Despite all the delicious and fancy brunch options around this fair city, there is something about those fluffy circles of love and their breakfast-y entourage that is undeniable. My standby is the banana pancakes, which come with a tropical syrup that tastes like (and might be) liquid marmalade. One week when I was feeling particularly childlike I went with the chocolate chip pancakes sans whipped cream. They hit the spot without making me feel like I was going to go into diabetic coma. If a traditional breakfast combo is what you seek grab the 2 eggs and either bacon or sausage meal (links are better than patties in this situation). It comes with a side of three pancakes and will be sure to fill you up right to the brim.  The staff matches up to the quality of the food beautifully. I have never encountered an OPH employee who was anything but cheery and helpful (This includes the waiter who said he could *make* some ginger ale for my friend. She said it tasted like Canada Dry but the fact that he came by to ask how it was left us wondering).  The next time you are wondering where to grab your mimosas or bloody marys on a Sunday afternoon, try passing on the trendy brunch and grab some good old pancakes. They'll do you a world of good.",

    "text": "Ah.  The reliability of a chain that isn't too chainy.  You know what I mean.  You go to IHOP and you kind of get some smelly booths and those IHOP uniforms... oh sure the pancakes are tasty and they've got a few 24 hour operations but its got a distinctively chain feel.  Now you go to what a friend of mine used to call OHOP (although I now realize that is inaccurate) and the place does a good job of pretending to be a somewhat nicer joe schmoe breakfast diner - IE clean and non smelly booths no matter how many darn kids are in the place.  On the other hand, I've been to a few of the Original House's in Chicagoland and now this one in Charlotte and you have the good parts of being a franchise -the same tasty coffee, the same delicious and slightly yeasty pancakes.",

Their menu is large and includes all your favorites, but the inclusion of pancakes with every meal makes it an absolute delight. I often find myself scouring through breakfast menus to find an option that includes both eggs and pancakes but at this place, there is no searching necessary since all eggs come with pancakes !",

    "text": "Nothing brightens my mornings faster than a short stack of  sweet and delicious pancakes!  This morning a few friends of mine talked me into trying out the Original Pancake House off of Charlottetowne Ave. We arrived at the restaurant at about 11:30 am, and it goes without saying that this place was packed. To my pleasant surprise we were seated within about 10 minutes. That was record time considering there were about 8 other parties in front of us.   Once seated we were greeted by our amiable waitress, and put in our orders. My champion breakfast that morning was the CIAA Combo #1, which consisted of two eggs scrambled with cheese, 5 strips of bacon, and 3 pancakes with a glass of apple juice to wash it all down. The food was delicious, it reminded me of my mother's homemade breakfasts. The pancakes were fluffy and moist, with just the right hint of sweetness in the  batter that you didn't even have to use alot of syrup. The eggs were scrumptious with a near perfect consistency and had a wonderful egg to cheese ratio. The only issue I could find with my breakfast was my bacon. As always, I ordered the turkey bacon, however, I neglected to ask for it to be cooked to the crisp. So when the waitress noticed this she kindly took back my bacon and brought me out a some fresh crisp strips. Such a kind staff, and very attentive. Overall, my dinning experience was memorable and pleasant, and my wallet thanked me. (My total for breakfast was only $8.97)   Outside of the restaurant are lots of shops and things within walking distance so feel free to shop around and work off some of that delicious meal you just indulged in. I sure did. Parking at the Original Pancake house is a little tight, but traffic in and out of the restaurant tends to move pretty quickly, so no worries.  I suggest you and your friends give the Original Pancake House a try, it's definitely a nice change of pace from the typical breakfast chains.",

    "text": "Pulled in on a whim...was heading for Einstein's bagels, but this place looked intriguing.  Large, bright warehouse/loft effect inside. Menu posted in lobby for convenience. Walls painted a pale lemon color, kitchen semi-open to the public. Friendly waitress (I ordered the coffee in spite of myself--trying to cut down--because she was so nice).  I ordered a plain waffle for the daughter and the sourdough french toast for me (we shared with each other, though).  She was given crayons and a kids' menu.  OH. Ingredients do make such a difference. According to the menu,   \"Our recipes demand only the very finest of ingredients, such as 93 score butter, pure 36% whipping cream, fresh grade AA eggs, hard wheat unbleached flour, and our own recipe sourdough starter. Our batters and sauces are made fresh in each restaurant's kitchen.\"  The flavor of the French was subtle and excellent.  The waitress said it was the almond (extract?).  I didn't realize until she said it, but that was what I was tasting (and I am not usually a fan of almond flavoring--that's how gently-flavored it was).  The texture was perfect--just enough resistance and softness in balance.   Sprinkled with powdered sugar, spread with butter, and anointed with warm syrup---I never clear my plate (portion control), but I cleared my plate (with my daughter's help).  The waffle my daughter had was thin and crispy. She liked it. She finished it. I tasted it. It was fine, but after my French toast, I wasn't having it.   The coffee I gave in and had was hot and aromatic. I think it was pretty expensive, though. Like twice as much as a tall cup of Sbux for less the coffee.   I was there around noon on a weekday. It was comfortably occupied, but not crowded. I have the feeling that it can get pretty crazy in the mornings, based on a sign in the lobby about waiting in line.   Definitely beats IHOP (duh). :-)",

    "text": "I am a huge OPH fan from way back, except I had always gone to the one in Laguna Niguel, CA.  When I saw this location as I was driving by one day, I had to turn around, pull into the parking lot, and tag it in my GPS so I could easily find it again.  Moving into a new area can be hard, but this was a piece of home that I was thrilled to find.  We showed up on a weekday, around 10.  We still had to wait about 10 minutes or so, which wouldn't have been so bad except there is no warm place to do it!  They have a little anteroom, but it is devoid of even a basic space heater.  When we were seated, I was happy to find that the tables were spaced out a little more (in CA, you are close enough to taste the food at the table next to you).  Decor pretty much consisted of blown-up posters of the menu fare.  The menu is pretty much the same, except CHEAPER (WH!!!).  This required me to get the baked apple pancake.  For years, I have been visiting OPH, and trying to get other items, except I almost always have the same thing.  Maybe I should call it the apple CRACKcake, because it's so addictive!  One of these days, I'm going to have to trick myself into getting something different by making my husband order while I run to the car or something, lol.  One menu item that I hadn't seen before was some sort of tropical chicken and fruit salad, prominently displayed in one of the aforementioned posters.  Seriously?  I thought it was a joke when I first saw it.  It is served in a hollowed out pineapple, with a banana sticking out of one end, in order to build some sort of \"fruit bird\".  The thing looks like a reject from 1950's era polynesian theme restaurants.  I'm guessing even Don Ho would have thought this thing kitschy, lol.  In any case, the apple pancake (and dh's cheese steak omelette) arrived.  I WAS a little disappointed, because THIS apple pancake was drowning in grease!  Normally I would have sent it back, but by this time we had struck up a conversation with the guy at the next table, and were thoroughly enjoying ourselves with that.  On a 2nd visit, the grease was thankfully absent, so I will have to see if they are inconsistent, or that was just an anomaly.  DH's cheese steak omelette ROCKED!  It had big chunks of meat that were tender and flavorful.  The omelettes are smaller than in CA, but still WAY huge (and did I mention cheaper?)  I will definitely make the OPH a go-to place for breakfast, if only to point and snicker at the scary bird salad.  ;)",

They are nice and thin with good texture, and the lingonberry sauce is yummy.  The plate of three is not a super-heavy meal and goes nicely with a side of bacon.  As for the rest of it, well, it's breakfast food classic style.  Not a lot of worldly innovation, but it's all good.  Plus they are open at the crack of dawn.",
