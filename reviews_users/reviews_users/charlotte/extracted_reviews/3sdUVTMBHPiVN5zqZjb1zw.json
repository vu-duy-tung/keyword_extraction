First every single individual that works there is rude, from the disinterested \"hostess\", to the waitresses who shout at you asking what you want to drink...and if asked what they have they answer \"Coke products\"...to the kitchen help that will mow you down with their carts of food.  This place is very, very dirty.  There are food scraps everywhere....all over the carpet, the dishes are crusty and the food choices, while expansive are just not that good.  The real kicker as to why we will never, ever return is as we were waiting for our check...we were seated in the aforementioned back room...my son happened to tap his foot.  All we heard were sloshing sounds...his chair was on top of a soaked carpet.  Immediately a major mold issue came to mind, so we commented to the waitress, she smirked and said \"oh thats from when they clean\"....ya right.  I had to get out of there....fast, and will never step foot in there again.  This PLACE IS DISGUSTING!!!!!",

I have to disagree- unfortunately and say that it was just the opposite. 1.5 stars...  When you walk in the place looks pretty fancy smanshy for a typical Chinese buffet style restaurant and I was psyched to see a sushi chef and hibachi chef. I'll admit the buffet was huge and at first glance looked good.  I enjoyed the wontop soup, coconut macaroons and ...that's about it. I didn't realize the green onions were a part of the salad bar so I unfortunately didn't put those in my soup : (  Most of the food was overly salted and not cooked crispy enough for my tasting. I did brave the sushi and actually didn't think the california rolls were too bad. I didnt end up trying the spicy tuna since I just couldn't get past it's appearance. I didn't get the hibachi since the line was a little too crazy for me- perhaps that's the way to go?  Health-wise this place is not ideal. Probably not a good place for a dieter or someone who needs to watch salt/fat intake.  On the bright side it was cheap.   Wont be back...",

They do offer a huge selection, and if we'd never eaten at Nakato or Kubuto, this place would have been amazing...  but since we have eaten at those higher end chains, we were not impressed with what Hibachi Grill had to offer.  The seating was tight and there were children running all over the place.  There were also what appeared to be some escort type ladies with their handlers not far behind filling up for their night on the town.  The food tasted ok, but nothing memorable or worth returning for unfortunately.",

We got shoved all the way in a back corner room, where we were the only ones speaking English (Mexican Spanish was king here). And it almost seemed like we interrupted a birthday party, I later found out that wasn't the fact. It was just a very loud, obnoxious room with little kids running around everywhere unsupervised. Start the meal off like that was and its bound to end up getting worse. The food was pretty gross, everything was over seasoned and salty. The \"Chinese\" food was a disgrace, I was surprised at the American food options. (Spiral ham, pizza, etc..) The buffet tables were so crowded with everyone going everywhere with no rhyme or reason....shoulder bumps were common. I don't know, just not my idea of a good meal.",

The food was cold, underseasoned, bland, and poorly prepared. The chicken was tough, the \"egg rolls\" were burnt and had very old ingredients for filling. The shrimp smelled old and so we didn't risk eating it.  The staff was extremely rude (lots of younger girls), and spent most of the time behind our table fighting, gossiping, and being very loud while rolling napkins. They also said many things (in English) about the customers in the restaurant that were very inappropriate for any environment.  Would NOT visit again, EVER!",

I felt a little dizzy after my meal and I didn't even overstuff myself like I normally would.

It also has a hibachi grill area where you can pick out fresh veggies and meats and have them cook it for you right there.   Since I love Japanese food this is such a cheap way to have both Japanese and chinese food together.  They also have your typical sushi rolls from buffets if you enjoy Chinese buffet sushi. They also have a good variety of fruits and desserts options and and you won't be disappointed by their ice cream. Its not the typical three flavor yogurt ice cream.   I love their Teriyaki steak and my daughter loves their sesame chicken. She says its the best in town. :)   The prices are very reasonable too. Its under $8 per person and thats very reasonable when considering their buffet selection. They also have one in the Kannapolis area.",

    "text": "I'm going to have to go with a solid 3 star on this one. We hit this place up last week for dinner and as far as size goes it was pretty impressive. They have about 8 buffet islands with assorted foods and deserts to choose from. You have all of your standard stuff like rices, chickens, dumplings, shrimp and some beef which I wouldn't recommend because it was way overcooked and tough. They also had a bit of a DIY hibachi grill in the back which was pretty nice. It's similar to the mongolian BBQ where you build your own plate and hand it off to the guy at the grill and he'll cook it up while you wait. It only takes about 5 minutes but you kinda feel like a schmuck standing there milling around waiting for the food to cook. The hibachi offers 3 different types of sauce the cook will mix in with your dish. Garlic, Teriyaki and a standard \"hibachi\" style. The later of the three I went with and it was delicious. The only downside to the hibachi is that they do not offer up the white sauce that I usually eat by the cupful at more upscale hibachi restaurants but it's probably for the best since that stuff isn't exactly the healthiest food on the planet. One thing we found the buffet lacking was crab. I'm pretty sure I saw a pile of Krab with a K but no crab legs or anything that tasty. That was a bit of a letdown but the ticket price for a meal reflected the missing premium item(s). All in all it was around 9$ per person and for what you got it really is a good value if you are in a super hungry mood but this isn't the type of place I would call fine dinning. The service was pretty decent. Like a lot of buffets they just kinda usher you in, get your drink orders and bus the plates off your table as you finish up. They were also good about keeping our waters filled up.",

I've been coming here over a year and it's NEVER been dirty, the food is overall quite good though some things were not to my taste, but that's any place you go. There's a huge selection all the time, the buffet is constantly being restocked, the sushi is beautifully fresh though not a huge selection, but at their prices I wouldn't expect a big selection. The staff has always been very polite to us but there is a language barrier with most of them. The hostess will sometimes have a cup at the entrance and the grill and sushi chefs do as well and I don't begrudge them that at all. You work in a hot, busy environment like that all the time with few breaks and see if you aren't thirsty. If you're expecting 5 star service and Michelin star rated food for $10 a plate all you can eat then you're quite honestly an idiot. For the price this is an excellent value and I'll be coming here often just like I have for the past year.",

There always seems to be a line even with the two rooms in the back for seating.  I recommend getting a booth if there is only 2 of you.  The tables are very close to accommodate 8 people and just pulled a little for 4 or less.    My recommendation for eating is make a trip to the Hibachi station first.  Drop your food off (pay attention to where it is at on the grill) and go get your sushi or other food, drop off at your table and go back to station to wait on the cooks.  He will point at your food and you order your sauce (I am a fan of Hibachi and Garlic) and he will plate it up for you.  Repeat as necessary.",

I tried their pizza which was bad and their doughnuts which were stale and bad. Even the soda was very watered down. Honestly it was so cheap $6 for lunch, I can't really expect better. I myself will not be back but my husband likes their hibachi, he is not picky about where he eats. The place could stand to be cleaner. Our waitress was nice but the hostesses were mediocre. I guess if you are looking for a cheap lunch place and are not picky about what you eat definitely the place to go.",

The seats are ripped, the walls are stained, there are signs posted everywhere telling you to keep your kids near you, very unprofessional and really takes away the vibe if you're not there with kids.

I understand they can muck up american food because their not used to cooking it, but even their food was god awful. $10 is way over priced for what you can get. Half the buffet was dessert and salad. I would say $5.99 would be more accurate to the service you get. This is the golden corral of foreign food.

Her favorite is picking & choosing her selections from the hibachi bar and letting the chef work his magic.  They also have their buffet bar that is painfully huge... you have a nice seperate dessert bar along with a salad bar to accompany the main attraction food bars. Too many choices... you can try one of each item and NOT have had everything they have to offer.  Next to their Hibachi bar, they have a nice little sushi bar as well. I'm not a sushi aficionado but it's made fresh and my wife seems to enjoy it.   From crab legs, to pizza, to hand dip ice cream, to sushi and pretty much any and everything else you can imagine. Simply put, they have more bars than a jail cell.   The bottomline - good food, fresh, generally clean, and reasonably priced and if your a fan of buffets, then this place is a MUST!",

The waitresses (and not all of them but it seems to have become most of them) usually don't bring us drinks, it has gotten to the point where we were waiting for drinks for about 20 minutes and decided to leave (and we hadn't even finished a plate yet). And in another visit here, our waitress literally put her hand out as if she were asking for a tip (which we always leave no matter what). Then in yet another visit the waitress gave my dad a dirty look and for the rest of us gave an attitude as if she didn't want to even serve us. And we ended up leaving again.",

The seating was bad too they say us in the back room and it's just awful for anyone who's claustrophobic. There's way too many tables in there and they're too close together.

I think it's kind of funny they put a gym in right next door, so you can feel guilty about yourself before you go in. Who knows, maybe it's how the gym recruits new members.   This restaurant has very friendly employees, but not all of them speak English. Most of the time you can grab someone who might understand, but it's not the case all of the time.   They have an area that has a kind of cafeteria type space where you can fill up your plate with raw veggies and some sort of meat, then they fry it up hibachi style.   This is really the only reason I go, because for $6.97 for a lunch buffet, I can get all of the hibachi I can eat. You can't really get to-go japanese for that cheap, so it's a win in my book. Set me up with a gallon of shrimp sauce and I am one happy girl.   Oh and for you sushi takers, they have sushi. Take a glance at that lunch price again. That includes sushi...",

Labels for the food were missing and I was not quite sure what I would eat.  I witnessed employees changing out trays of food with no gloves or hair covering.  Had I been a health inspector, I would have shut it down immediately.  Plus I was charged $9.99.... Seriously???  Stay clear!!!  dirty, very dirty...",

This place has a big buffet selection for a pretty good price. This place is usually always crowded on Fridays or Saturdays, so there may be a wait. The place is really noisy and sometimes I wish I could hear the restaurant music and not other guest conversations. One thing I would say that I do not like about this place would be the bathrooms. The bathrooms are nasty. You have to have enough staff on the clock for a busy business such as this to tidy up the bathrooms. I will continue eating here. Haven't been disappointment   food wise just will never use there bathrooms.",

I forgot what used to be in this shopping center - I think a Media Play... but the space that the Hibachi Grill and Buffet now resides at used to be a Goody's clothing store so it had a lot of space to work with.  There are rows and rows of food... anything you can think of.  It's not all Asian inspired cuisine, there is pizza and chicken fingers for the kids.  There's even a sushi bar in the back - (quantity sushi rather than quality), but it's still sushi and pretty good for a buffet.  In the back there is a Mongolian grill setup where you can pick all your ingredients and the chef in the back stir fries it for you.  Decent price for such a large buffet.  I'll definitely go again, just that I always feel like I never get my $$s worth since I don't like eating until I'm about to pop.",

She also used the same rag to wash the chairs and tables. Once we saw it, we left our food and just left. Disgusting. Never will be returning.

There is something for everyone here from tasty salads and vegetarian, sushi, and standard Chinese and Japanese dishes as well as pizza and American cuisine plus a large selection of oriental pastries as well as ice cream. The food is quite delicious and freshly refilled by friendly staff. The restaurant appeared clean. Prices quite resonable and a reduced price for children. I asked for a cup of coffee instead of tea and surprised it was good and that they actually served coffee. Everyone in our party enjoyed their food. One of the best oriental buffets I've been to",

Quality is normally good, on occasion we have had pieces of food that were questionable, but for a large buffet they do a good job of keeping it stocked and fresh. They have a good variety of seafood too, which is a nice surprise. The jalapeno poppers they have are delicious. I'm also a huge fan of their seafood soup. It's spicy and delicious. Not a big fan of the sushi. I used to love it but I was spoiled going to an all you can eat, made to order sushi place in the town I live in, so I normally avoid it. I got a few pieces just to see, but it wasn't great.",

    "text": "Ay yi yi, guys. Where do I even start? This place was absolutely nothing special. It was, to me, a place with a bunch of random food and a hibachi grill. Nothing extraordinary, nothing that made me smile or feel pleased.  First off, the fruit was dry and not really that fresh. The pineapple tasted like it was from a can, and like it had been sitting out for a few hours. I didn't really consider that a big deal because it was just fruit so then I moved on to some other dishes.  I had the sushi from the sushi section and there were only about eight types of sushi. Tbh, they didn't really look that appetizing and that's coming from me- I absolutely love sushi. They tasted a little too basic for me and there weren't any real differences between the different types so I just gave up on eating them. The only thing that redeemed my food experience was the hibachi, which I added crab meat, noodles, and broccoli to.  It's okay for a first-timer but there is absolutely nothing special about this place. At $10.59, you would probably get a better deal getting food you'll actually enjoy.",

Certainly not all items that I prefer, but that's what makes it great for the masses; there's something for everyone. The cost was $10.95 for the adult dinner buffet. My intention for visiting an Asian buffet is for American Chinese selections and all you can eat sushi  And if You can save any room they have pretty decent dessert selection including ice cream.   I would've given them a three star review, but there's one item in particular they offer that I have not been able to find anywhere else. Since relocating from PA I've looked at many places for Coconut Chicken and this is the first place that has it. If you've never had this, it's a must. Deep fried (like general tso's) and covered in a sweet creamy white sauce   When I heard this, I drove home, got the family and we went in to load up to go containers. Mine consisted of fried rice, mostly coconut chicken, broccoli and I always love the teriyaki chicken skewers. Turned out to be a great deal so make sure to remember this place the next time your interested in take out!!!",
