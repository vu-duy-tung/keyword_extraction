    "text": "I mentioned Roaming Fork in a review for Cupcake Delirium, so I need to give them their full credit here.  They are worthy to stand alone.  This food truck has been stopping in Plaza Midwood lately and I've been able to sample some of their wares.  They also set up at other places around Charlotte, but if it's outside a 2-mile radius from Plaza-Midwood, then I wouldn't have a clue where that is. Yes, as others are howling about, the BBQ is gooooood.  They even tried their hand at Korean BBQ and you know what, pretty darn good for white folk.  Their slaw, which comes often with their meals, is out of this world.  Not sure what's in there - secret recipe - I see some corn?  They also have tasty fries and fried deviled eggs.  Nice people too - \"good eggs\" as midwesterners like to say. When they're in Plaza-Midwood, they have been setting up in front of the Meineke shop near the overpass for Independence.  I like the location - beautiful views of uptown and the Duke Energy building with all its colorful lights which must use a lot of energy.  Residential rate hike - kaching!! My only complaint is that they call themselves the Roaming Fork.  I think this is disrespectful to other eating utensils, like the knife and the spoon or even the spork or chopsticks or hands.   Yep, I'm a Roaming Eating Utensil groupie too.  Rock on food trucks!!",

We had the fish tacos and the pulled pork sandwhiches. I've had several inquiries from party goers so they could have them host their party.   Easy to do business with. Reasonable prices and accommodating service. Would do it all over again!",

Fan of the fish tacos for sure- also have tried the black & blue burger  and the greek chicken sandwish- both were great. Shrimp tacos were ok- I liked the blackened fish ones better. I loved that slaw that used to have- everytime I go now I never see it. It had ranch dressing with corn etc- was so good with the tacos but it seems they have gotten rid of it. They also take debit cards which is nice- and combos w a drink run about $8 so it's not too pricey.",

The Roaming Forks fish tacos have so much flavor and don't taste commercial at all. Their tacos are amazing and I'm a huge fan now. Cabo's tacos use to have so much flavor and didn't taste commercial, like their coming off assembly line. I've been looking for a good replacement and the Roaming Fork has filled my fish taco void. Treat yourself and grab their fish tacos!",

I was fortunate to let my nostrils lead me to this truck at a chowdown uptown food truck festival last week...amazing.  I LOVE me some bbq, but this pulled pork put every other pulled pork I have ever had to shame.  It does not need any condiments, the smell alone is intoxicating. The meat feels like it is melting in your mouth; tender and juicy and absolutely  mouth watering. YUM!",

It took me two months to track them back down, but I just had it again (with pulled pork) today.  So glad I found Roaming Fork again.

    "text": "I think I have managed to have everything on the Roaming Fork's menu now and I have to say there's a lot going on here! Every Thursday or something like that it parks around the Morrison offices that I am usually doing some sort of work around so that makes it a convenient lunch stop for sure. They manage to score a lot of hits and a few misses with their menu, though I wish they'd change it up a bit sometimes.   Onto the food let's start with that fried deviled egg, good but I think I prefer regular deviled eggs. The creaminess gets a bit lost for me in the fried outer shell and the texture wasn't appealing to me though some of my friends love it.  Parmesan truffle herb fries? Crispy, hot, crunchy. First thing Shauna and I said as we ate them, needs a sauce desperately (other than ketchup). I can't taste too much truffle oil which is a good thing because I don't care for it too much.  Cole slaw omg creamy dreamy deliciousness. I must figure out what's in it!  Fish Tacos, I gotta say best fish tacos I've had in Charlotte so far. Yeah I went there. Big generous hunks of blackened whitefish bursting with flavor, and the corn salsa with mango gives it a nice sweet and salty flavor.  Grilled cheese/stuffed with pulled pork. Yummy, could feel my arteries clogging up with every buttery cheesy porky bite. I think If you put some jam or compote to add some acid to cut some of the fattiness in this it would be a winner.  Chicken wings are super tender and almost fall apart in your mouth. Great smokiness and BBQ is awesomesauce. I must have more of these.  So now you've reached the end of my highly scientific dissertation on the various dishes of the Roaming Fork. Mosey on over there and treat yourself to a nice helping of deliciousness! They accept plastic too for your convenience!",

    "text": "I first had the opportunity to try Roaming Fork at the first Chow Down Uptown Food Truck Festival about a month ago and I fell INSTANTLY in love with Roaming Fork!   My first taste of love from Roaming Fork was their \"Award Winning Pulled Pork Sandwich.\" This was THE BEST BBQ I have ever tasted in my life! The pork is actually pulled (not the cafeteria type!) super melt-in-your-mouth tender, and seasoned to PERFECTION, no words can adequately describe the state of pleasure my tastebuds were in! You cannot go wrong with this! This alone kept me wanting to come back to Roaming Fork for more!  Today, my friends and I attended the 2nd Chow Down Uptown Food Truck Festival and we knew we had to order from them again! We ordered:  - Award Winning Pulled Pork Sandwich. (again! because I love it so much)  - Cheesy Grilled Cheese With Pulled Pork. Just as delicious as their award winning pulled pork but with 3 types of cheese, but it was a little bit too cheesy for my own personal liking but STILL amazing, my friend loved it!  - Blackened Fish Tacos w/ Roasted Corn Salsa & Lime Cilantro Sauce. WOW, just wow! The best fish tacos I've ever had! The fish was tender and cooked to perfection, I was unable to taste any of the fishiness from the taco. The taco was packed with so much flavor (but not to the point that it was overwhelming!) I really do not know how to describe how wonderful their tacos were, but I will tell you that they were the first item to sell out on their menu!  - Fried Deviled Eggs. Very good, but sadly I can't remember how it tasted to describe how this was. I only ended up trying one bite from a friend because I was so, so full from eating everything else!!  In conclusion, WHO KNEW a food truck could serve such quality and delicious food?! I can confidently say that Roaming Fork serves better food than most restaurants I've been to! So what are you waiting for? Go out and support Roaming Fork and the very few food trucks we have in Charlotte!!",

Orders were taken in front of the truck and then delivered from the window. Brilliant !!! it didn't feel like you were waiting in line, but instead, hanging our with friends and family until your order was ready. Delicious is an understatement.....Once everyone had been served (some more than once), Kelli wrapped everything up and drove away. It was perfect.",

I usually get the Porky Cheesy (pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich) with the parmesan herb fries, and have never been disappointed. For a while Roaming Fork was offering a chicken variety of this sandwich called the Chicken Smackdown, but it seems to have been removed from the menu. Most items are in the $7-$10 range and you get a cold drink or bottled water with the cost of the order, no extra charge. The wait can get a little long during peak times so make sure to budget time for your lunch. Roaming Fork pops up at different locations in Charlotte during the week; Google them to find out where they are on which days. (Thursdays noon in Ballantyne!)",

At least what I have been missing from the Roaming Fork truck situated perfectly downtown today so I could hop out of my car...and be in line in less than a minute!  The flavors of the blackened fish taco were simply amazing.  The heat of the spices, lightly chilled by a little sour cream, with lettuce and a SW type relish made it so so very tasty.  And to support those two great soft tacos...I had to have some cheese fries...no, not the velveeta variety ...but nicely fried shoestring potatoes with garlic parmesan sprinkled all over them. They were so good that as I walked past one of Charlotte's finest...I had to offer her some!!  It was nice to share some goodness with someone who had only moments before [serving and protecting], kept me from stepping in front of a moving vehicle as I raced to get my Roaming lunch!!!

    "text": "Roaming Fork is taking the typical food truck fare and upping the game. With options like smoked pulled pork and wings, parmesean herb fries and fried deviled eggs it is easy to get your hopes way up and on the whole Roaming Fork delivers.  I was a big fan off the meats. Both the pork and chicken were well seasoned and delicious. I'm not usually a boned wings fan and even I might be coerced into an order or two.  The sides were less spot on for me but still good. The fries were thin and their relationship to the parmesan was less \"coated in\" and more \"sitting in a pile of\". Still, the flavor was good and with a little assembly they went to the face. The fried deviled egg was actually s coated fried egg salad, which is in and of itself cool. But don't promise me a fried deviled egg unless that thing has a center that looks like a party at my tacky aunts. I don't mess around with deviled eggs.  Next time I see the Roaming Fork truck around town I'll be pulling over to grab a bite; this bistro on wheels has some tasty treats.",

She is some what of a picky eater so I let her choose what truck we were going to try. She stopped right at the Roaming Fork. She ordered the porky three cheese and had the fish taco both with fries. With in 10 mins we had our food. Which was surprising because there was a long line. We began to eat our food and from the first bite we looked at each other and had this non verbal conversation with our eyes. The food taste so great! Good fish tacos are very hard to find but the flavor  of the fish and sauce were perfect. The Parmesan fries were the perfect compliment to the tacos. My wife finished her plate before and said that she has never had pork taste that good. What a great start to a evening we will enjoy again!",

My wife loves the way they prepare the fries as well, the parmesan truffle thing has got it going on for her!  You know what they say, \" If Mama's happy everybody is happy!\"  This is True here.  The Roaming Fork is a great little High Quality Food Truck that serves food that is better than most sit down Restaurants!  I would have given it a fve stars if they had something else on the menu for me and I couldn't give a 4 1/2.  Worth a try, you won't be disappointed!",

If requested she will also replace bread with more lettuce. The food is fresh and flavorful and I recommend that you give it a try! Another good plus is her sanitation rating is a 98!",

I have to say I was disappointed in the salad. The salmon was good, but the greens underneath were shredded iceberg lettuce. This just reminds me of a McDonald's hamburger and grabbing a handful of lettuce from a plastic bag. For a $10 salad that's fairly small, though it did come with fries, I would at least expect some romaine. There was a bit of arugula so I'll give them that, but clearly I have a problem with iceberg lettuce. Maybe it's just me!   Overall I'll definitely go back and try something else if I have the opportunity.",

    "text": "I am officially becoming a Roaming Fork Groupie, which can't be good for my waistline. Every Thursday I make it a point to visit for lunch. A couple of things have changed, so it's a good time for an update.  Since my initial visits, I've tried more dishes. The fried deviled eggs are good, but they really need the mustard sauce with each bite to add some tang. I've also had a chance to try the pamesan herbed fries, which were crispy and hot. The parmesan added just the right amount of flavor and salt.   Finally, I've had a chance to try the famous blackened fish tacos. Here's the thing: I'm not a huge fish taco fan. Everyone raved about them, so I tried them, and I recognize that they are an excellent version of a fish taco... But that's not my favorite kind of food. If you like fish tacos, you'll almost certainly love these.  What IS my kind of food? Well, the grilled cheese, as my previous review made clear. The past few visits, they've started offering the option of pulled pork on the grilled cheese. Oh. My. God. They took my two favorite sandwiches, and combined them into one. I think about that pulled pork grilled cheese - a lot. Usually when I'm eating a salad. Their grilled cheese sandwiches will keep me coming back for more, for a long time. Particularly if they keep offering pork with them!  The last two trips out to Ballantyne, I've also noticed that they have an \"expediter\" managing orders at the window. Last week, she wasn't wearing a Roaming Fork t-shirt, and people thought she was waiting in line. This week there was a really engaged woman in a RF t-shirt greeting everyone who showed up right away. She did a great job, and I think the addition of someone to manage the orders on the front end, while they work on getting them put together inside the truck is a great one.  There will be many more visits from me! All of the food is great, the people are so nice, seek them out and you won't be disappointed!",

There's something really special about Roaming Fork, and it's the details and Kelly the owner who is fabulous and passion oozes from her body when talking and making and dishing out her food.   Yeah, yeah, parmesan truffle fries.  But these...are so wickedly crispy (oh I just showed my Boston roots) they put most other shames in the QC to shame.  Seriously.    Her deep fried deviled eggs and pimento cheese balls are crispy and different, and having a nice side of roasted honey broccoli and carrots is a nice departure from cole slaw.  You can also get sides like watermelon in the summer, or house-made kimchee cucumbers (albeit not traditional and buried and fermented in the ground...but hey, it's a tasty accompaniment.)   I also like how her prices really are reasonable.  For $8 you can get something like two fish tacos, a side and a drink.    TIP: Check out the website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.roamingfork.net%2F&s=afb72e8e7840bb4bb5e220f640c7727834e6a8b38b53b732677c7c109755c33a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">roamingfork.net</a> for a complete calendar.

The other Yelpers are right about this food - it leaves you craving for it again a day or two later.    It's a good thing that they only come to Ballantyne Corporate Park once a week so that I don't over-indulge!   (I'd hate to see the calorie count for the grilled cheese sandwich and a side of those wonderful parmesan-truffle fries!)   But, the major down-side to going for lunch is that it usually takes about 30 mins to get my order prepared. (There always seems to be a line when I go by!)  In 90 degree heat (while dressed for the office) with little to no shade around, waiting for your lunch outdoors becomes rather uncomfortable.   However, I think they are trying to reduce the wait-times, because today they had a third person with them - to take orders and payments so now Kelli along with Darryl can totally focus on preparing the food.",

This food truck makes a weekly trek to the corporate park where I work in yuppie-town (Ballantyne) every Thursday to serve up the deliciousness.  They open up the window at 11 and it's slammed throughout lunch time.  The secret is out!  There are all kinds of good things on the menu, and it changes frequently.  I have tried several of the items and have always been happy.  You'll find burgers, chicken, fish, barbecue, and probably other things that I haven't even noticed yet.  The fish tacos are the most popular item and for good reason.  They do 'em up right with the cabbage and the corn salsa.  There are tasty sides as well.  The truffle fries are darn good but I tend towards the lighter side for lunch and prefer the couscous or the tomato cucumber salad.     This is about the best lunch you can get for under 10 bucks, and you feel good about eating it because the folks are nice and the food is awesome.  And you gotta love supporting the local food truck scene!  Keep it up, Roaming Fork",

    "text": "Favorite food truck. Hands down. I need to stalk them more... OK, lets hop into it. First time I've had the pleasure of their cuisine was at Food Truck Fridays. They were out of a lot of the menu items as we arrived quite late. I ordered the Ooey Gooey Grilled Cheese and my friend got the Porky Sandwich, made with pickles and onions. Let it be known, here and now, the best grilled cheese has always come on thick, crunchy slices of sourdough bread so I was in love when I opened my box and found exactly that.   The sandwich was large and ooey gooey is right... it was shoved full of melted cheese and I was in heaven. Best part? I'm use to food trucks being a bit more pricey for one item but this sandwich also came with a side of parmesan herb fries which in one word is amazeballs. I bite heavily into my friend's pork sandwich (hey, we traded for a sample... I wasn't hijacking his food) and it was juicy and dripping with sauce. Another thumbs up for RF.   I was quite satisfied after my meal and checked out their menu for future yummy evenings. Still need to sample oversized pork mac pimento cheese balls and have also heard the fish tacos are the best thing on the menu - can't believe I haven't had them yet as I love tacos and am a huge seafood fan - but I'm addicted to that grilled cheese and parmesan fries combo.   Roaming Fork hasn't been at Food Truck Fridays lately (ummm come back) but I plan to make it a point to find them quite soon and indulge!",

Not only do they spin out a great grilled cheese, tasty tacos, hearty meatloaf sandwich, intriguing fried deviled egg, but they also make deeelightful parmesan herb fries. I'm more than happy to devour these while in my chunky train headed to obese city.   The eats are affordable, the owner and the folks who create these delicious bites are incredibly friendly and in it to make people smile. Get yourself some Roaming Fork!",

Those fries are on my top ten list of comfort foods. This visit, I enjoyed shrimp tacos with parmesan truffle fries and chicken and veggie potstickers. Yes I'm greedy.   The shrimp in the tacos was 'blackened' but not so 'blackened' that you get like you were eating burnt meat; just grilled to perfection . There was an interesting  mango salsa on the taco that was also pretty tasty . I like the spicy bbq sauce they have as a condiment on the truck , I dipped my fries in this as well as a thousand island based ( I think) dressing that came with my entree. The potstickers came with an awesome dipping sauce as well. So saucy. So good :-)",

The girl taking orders was really nice and accommodating so that gives them the extra star and I decided to stay after talking to her.    I ordered the sliders and they were very good.  The wings, on the other hand, were not!  They were honestly some of the worst wings I've had.  My friend agreed and even tried giving me some of hers, that I declined to take.  They were not crispy, although requested.  They were slimy inside and had no seasoning before being cooked.  Or at least it didn't taste that way!! I was really disappointed.",

    "text": "The Roaming Fork comes to Brixham Tent every Thursday. I've been wanting to try it since I began working in the area, however, I'd been hooked on the other truck that comes the same day. But since I had seafood all week, I wanted something different. The truck is always busy. However, there is a lady standing right in front of it taking orders so the cooks are not disturbed, which means food gets done quickly. I placed my order, 12 Hour Hickory Smoked Pulled Pork Sandwich w/Pickled Onion & Butter Pickles, Add Cheese & BBQ Sauce (you add the sauce your self, they have regular or spicy), and a side of the Parmesan Herb White Truffle French Fries. I asked if she had the Fried Deviled Eggs & she said not this week, but she'd have them next week since I was the 2nd person to ask for them. I can't really eat the yolk of eggs anymore, I developed an intolerance for them during a diet. But I wanted to try these so bad after hearing so many great reviews on them that I was willing to suffer the stomach ache after for a bite lol. It was BLAZING hot out so I stood under a tree for shade as I waited for my order. I saw just about everyone grabbing a drink out the cooler & thought they must've all added a drink to their order. About 8 minutes later, which felt like 20 I'm that heat, they called my name to pickup my order. I added sauce to my sandwich and ketchup for my fries and headed back to my office to eat.   At first glance I was disappointed in my sandwich. I asked if they could add cheese since it doesn't typically come with cheese, she asked the cook who said yes. So I was confused when I saw cold shredded cheddar cheese on my sandwich. Did they really think this was acceptable?? They could have at least warmed the sandwich a bit to melt the cheese or told me no cheese! Who wants cold shredded cheese on their warm sandwich??? So they lost half a star for this. I went to the microwave and melted the cheese myself. But I'm hard to please when it comes to BBQ because in my opinion, there's no BBQ better than the BBQ in Lexington NC. I usually don't even try others BBQ because of this. I don't EVER dare add cheese to that BBQ, but I'm glad I did with Roaming Fork. It added another layer of flavor which I felt the sandwich needed. The BBQ alone was really good though as well as the portion, not the bang I'm used to but probably the only BBQ I've had outside of Lexington that I actually liked. So that says a lot, trust me!!! It wasn't dry and was nice and tender and the smokey flavor really came through. The fries stole the show!! So crisp!! I was impressed because I hate takeout fries because they get soggy in the box, but not these!! Sooo much flavor for a fry! I was a little disappointed with the portion of fries I got though. I looked under the sandwich to see if there were more, but nope, that half a cup was all there was lol. That was the other half star they lost. Can I get a few more fries please??   All in all I enjoyed my food so much that I went back before they closed to order the same thing for my dinner tonight. This time I asked how much for a drink and I was told it came with the meal. It's probably a good idea to tell people this when they place their order. You never know who is new or not. But I told her I didn't get mine earlier and she let me get 2. They also gave me a small container to put sauce in since I would be eating this plate later. Next time I head downstairs to try them I have a few other things on their menu that I'd like to try. I heard just about everything was good and after that sandwich I'm not nervous about venturing out with them.   Now they have me wanting to make a trip home for some good ole Lexington BBQ!   Thanks for reminding me of home!",

And the fish tacos at Phat Burrito paled in comparison. The Roaming Fork taco was stuffed with fish, lettuce and grilled corn salsa. It tasted fresh and remarkably creamy (combination of corn and some sour cream). The 2 tacos come with their signature parmesan fries. I have no idea how they managed to perfectly coat each fry (even though I was the first order of the night!) but they did. The fries are relatively thick cut If you saw a crazy person trying to balance a to-go container while eating fries down Tryon, that was probably me. If I happen to track down this truck again, I'd be tempted just to buy a whole serving of fries.   Service here is friendly and at regular speed. The serving size is larger than that of TIn Kitchen's. So I'm going to have to give Roaming Fork the one up this time--I still recommend trying both for the variety of flavors.",

If awesomeness is a word, there's should be a picture of Roaming Fork next to it.  Foodgasm is another word.   The fish tacos were fresh, flavorful and they had an amazing farm fresh corn salsa on it.  Just that alone sent me to esctacy.    And the staff at Roaming Fork is great as well...willing to suggest items.  On this experience they had an Ostrich burger which they said was amazing.    Yeah, after 3 visits to Roaming Fork, they are definitely worth the 5 stars.    Who knew that Food Truck food could be so delicious!",
