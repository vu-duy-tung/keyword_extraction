    "text": "EDIT: So I've been back since my first review. I didn't edit it, because it still wasn't all that great to me.  I got a call from some friends to come out for lunch. \"Sure, where to?\" I asked. \"Midwood,\" they said. \"Ugh. Well, ok,\" I replied. I went back begrudgingly, but with an open mind to try something new. This time I got the Red Neck Cobb. It was lunch, and I didn't want a sandwich or anything too heavy. The salad was a good portion, with plenty of smoked turkey, bacon, and other goodies on top.  Much to my surprise, I really liked the turkey! Just enough smoke flavor, a bit dry, but very tasty nonetheless.  One friend had the special of \"Burnt Edges\" with a Dr. Pepper barbecue sauce. This was very good, too. I could tell it might get to be a bit rich, but again another pleasant surprise.  I will go back again and be more open to trying other items on the menu. --------------------------------------   Hmmm, I wonder if I ate at the same place as the other reviewers?  Took the fam there to try it out. Right away I was excited because the service is great!  I ordered the small bbq plate, with mac & cheese as my side. Well, for $9.95 I expected more. I got a very small portion of bbq, 3 very tiny drops of hush puppies, and an appropriate size of mac & cheese. (Is this the americanization of large portions in me to expect a bit more? Perhaps...) But truly I don't think it mattered. I was unimpressed with the bbq.  Hubs ordered the appetizer wings as his dinner. And he was unimpressed, too. The wings were dry (both in texture and no sauce). I gave him my eastern style bbq sauce to dip them in, and that helped.  However, the surprise dinner we both thought was really good was for the kid - the sloppy joe was really good. (Made with the brisket.)  All in all, I might give it another shot. But only until I see some more yelpers out there saying that the food cost is more reasonable to the portion. And that the bbq has gotten better. Will probably go back for night beers with friends, and maybe some apps (I heard the bacon wrapped jalapenos are good...).  I give the food 2 stars and the service 5 stars.",

    "text": "As a fan of all things BBQ and a resident of the Elizabeth neighborhood, I was thrilled with Midwood opened. I wish my enthusiasm for the the place could have been maintained following my 3 meals there.  The food is on point over all. My only real beef is with the BBQ beans which lack the sweetness and bacony flavor that I expect with BBQ beans. There's are mushy and taste too much of green and red pepper for me. The 'cue is solid from the sandwich to the brisket, to the chicken.   Why only 2 stars then? Well, the easiest answer is the service is borderline terrible. While generally friendly enough, they tend to disappear for unacceptably long periods of time and when they do return to grace you with their presence they have usually forgotten something you requested, like a drink refill, or have delivered the wrong food. If you are gonna charge $8.00 for a chopped sandwich I don't think its unreasonable on my part to expect a consistent service to go along with it.   If you ask me, they seem all too aware of their owner and his other success and are resting on their laurels a little bit too soon.",

    "text": "I went for lunch the first time and decided that I would go with the small Carolina pulled pork BBQ and a side of cole slaw.  If you are going to a smokehouse, I thought I should start there.   Delicious!  Finally, good BBQ in Charlotte.  Smoky and tender.  The slaw was good and homemade.  A few tiny hush puppies the size of Tater Tots that were also tasty.  Some pickled onions to set it off a bit.   I got a small platter, and while I wouldn't call the portion generous, it was certainly enough.  But no leftovers :(  Service was very good, quick and responsive.  Friendly and well tended on drinks and checking to see if we needed anything.  I liked the presentation on real plates, vintage retro diner type, a nice touch.    I didn't realize that this was another Frank Scibelli restaurant until I signed on to write a review.   I am a big fan of Mama Ricotta's, Cantina, and Bad Daddy's Burgers formerly Big Daddy's  (great breakfast, if you haven't tried them).  I have high expectations for anything he is associated with.  Midwood didn't disappoint me.   I expect that it will only improve as they settle in.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.    We were lucky not to have to wait to be seated, but as more folks discovered this place sometimes there is a wait.  We sat outside at the picnic tables under umbrellas, which was really nice.   Bravo..  Maybe I should give it 5 stars after all.  Just for getting the Q right.  Okay - changed.  I originally gave 4 out of 5 only because I hadn't tried more of of the menu and based it  on one meal.   Sometimes I am disappointed because I know the BBQ can be superb, and sometimes it is too salty.  I raised it to five because I realized that since it opened, it is one of my favorite places for casual and the only place I want to go for BBQ.    I say it is the best in the area for BBQ.",

My family and I are down here from Iowa at our nieces wedding and I wanted to experience some traditional NC BBQ as opposed to the traditional sweet and saucy Kansas City BBQ we are used to in the Midwest (which is also awesome by the way).  We did not leave disappointed or hungry.  The service was outstanding and friendly.  The outside seating was great.  The fried pickles left my fried pickle fan daughter impressed.   My vegetarian daughter even crossed over to the \"dark side\" for an evening with the moist pulled pork dinner.  I must say I am a fan of the spicy/tangy North Carolina vinegar based sauce and the baked beans were the best I've ever had.  Spicy and meaty.  A definite winner!",

Wife wanted a mix drink and she ordered a Mai Tai.  Big mistake, the bartender wasn't at all experienced.  The waiter brought a small shaker glass full of this blue mess.  It tasted as if they just poured the two rums in a glass and sent it on its way.  I asked the waiter to take it back and put it in a bigger glass with some pineapple and orange juice.  When it came back it was sour and did not taste at all like a drink should be.  Told the waiter it wasn't good at all and he did nothing about it. My wife ordered the BBQ sandwich with slaw and hush puppies.  I ordered the small chopped plate with fries and the plate had some kind of onions soaked in vinegar and hush puppies.  This place had to have the worst BBQ that I have ever eaten.  The BBQ was mushy and just didn't taste right at all.  The hush puppies seemed doughy and the fries and slaw were actually good. The atmosphere of the place was cheerful and upbeat.  The staff was super nice.  Too bad the food wasn't all that good.",

The only upside to our visit was the manager on duty was very understanding and took off the plates that were cold. We were very excited to try this as we saw many positive reviews, sadly we will not be returning. Def not the best BBQ.",

Atmosphere was nice and it was cool to see that former President Obama once even ate here as can be seen by a couple of pictures near the front door.  I thought that was pretty cool too. It was a laid back place and casual attire is acceptable.   As for the food, it was recommended by the waitress to get the brisket since she said it was her favorite things there.  Worked out well because that's actually what I came for and let me tell you, it was some great brisket; some of the best I think I have ever had. It had a perfect smoky taste to it and I enjoyed it without even using any sauce on it since it tasted so amazing on its own. We will definitely be returning and I highly recommend coming here if you are in the Plaza Midwood area and want some great BBQ.",

    "text": "I have never been to North Carolina before and when the opportunity presented itself to visit one of the barbeque staples in America, I could not resist. After speaking with a few locals on where the best barbeque was, Midwood Smokehouse was always mentioned. On a peaceful Labor Day afternoon, I called an Uber and directed my driver to this location.  After entering the premises, I was quickly greeted and offered the choice of indoor or outdoor seating. I chose indoor seating given that it was going to rain. My waitress came up to me within a few minutes and asked what I wanted to drink. I settled on the sweet tea, one of the most sought after beverages in the South. I large cup of ice cold sweet tea was brought to my table, and I told. the waitress that I decided on the Well-Fed Combination plate, complete with beef brisket, hickory sausage, ribs, hushpuppies , Carolina chopped pork, and bacon wrapped jalepenos. Unfortunately, they did not have ribs today, so they gave me the option of chicken or doubling up on another meat entree. Figuring that I should try all the meats, I opted for chopped chicken bbq.   I was dining alone so I spent a few minutes on my phone enjoying sips of the sweet, sugary iced tea. However, within a good seven minutes, my large whopping order presented itself in front of me. The waitress asked if it was my first time and proceeded to explain the different sauces. I was barely listening as I was salivating over the piles of meat. I dug in and fell in love with the brisket. They gave me a mix of both lean and fatty brisket and the combination of both, literally melting in my mouth, was enough for me to keep eating more. No sauces were required for the brisket. The hickory smoked sausage was perfectly grilled with that snap you would expect with any perfectly smoked sausage casing. The pork and chicken were equally tender, but the beef brisket was the star of the meal. All the meats were a wonderful pair to the collard greens, bacon wrapped jalepenos, and hush puppies.  I'm said to say that I am only in North Carolina for a month, but I will definitely be back for brisket!",

Overall good vibe/smells. Staff was very friendly and upbeat. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and my wife ordered the brisket plate. You can get lean, fatty, or mixed which I had never seen before. The waitress strongly recommended the mixed as being more flavorful. I was skeptical that you would ever order meat as \"fatty\". My wife ordered the mixed and my skepticism proved correct. There was not much mixed about it as it was mostly fatty and inedible. The flavor was merely OK. We had eaten brisket a couple of nights before at Maverick's in Durham that was fabulous; lean, fork tender, and smokey. She was wanting the same kind of experience. Not so. The Cuban was very good however. Wonderful taste, delicious Cuban style bread which they apparently have shipped in from Miami. So, overall would recommend just DO NOT get the brisket.",

    "text": "Top spot for Barbecue in the Queen City.  Hands down probably one of the best barbecue in the area. Let's just jump into the food since it is well deserving of the 5 stars.   I ordered the beef brisket that was cooked to near perfection. It was all the juices and literally melted in your mouth. The brisket was not dry and carried a mild smoke flavored. The brisket had a nice smoked ring on the meat. My sides included baked beans and smoked veggies which were nicely prepared. The bake beans were prepared with a nice balance of spice, sweetness and smokiness. The veggies had a nice smokey flavor but still were crunchy and fresh.   My wife ordered the half of chicken and ribs (large portion)!! The chicken was tender and carried a nice smoked flavor (well balance). The ribs seemed to be amazing since she left no visible signs of the once ribs.   The server did a great job being on top of everything and made up for our food being late (free hushpuppies).   But there is one small suggestion that we would like to make; change of ambiance. This involves a lighter dinning room area (more light to dark) and patio area that can provide some shade (yes I know its the south and get over it, but it would have been nice for shade.)   However, the food was overall to epic to give a rating lower than a 4 star.   Will be back.",

The rub used on the ribs was too spicy and had the consistency of sawdust. The fatty Brisket was just fat. The pulled pork was sauteed in cayenne pepper and habanero as well as some kind of mystery spice. (It may have been hippie strength pepper spray). The management seemed very defensive when we tried to ask questions.  The servers seemed ok. All in all we won't be going back since there are many truly good BBQ places around and we don't have to lower our standards by going to Midwood Smokehouse.",

I was given a gift card which I wanted to use but I didn't know Bad Daddy's and Midwood were no longer connected. So beware. It ended up being more expensive than I would've like to pay. $50+ tax for one plate of BBQ, one salmon, wings and a drink. The wings were good; I'd recommend those. All flats is extra. I ordered the brisket ends with fries and coleslaw plus a side of pulled pork. They don't do combo platters but sides of meat for $3-4 extra. My plate ended up being $22.50. Yikes. The brisket ends were kind of fatty, the pulled pork comes without sauce, crinkle fries were ok, hush puppies were good and coleslaw was plentiful. I ordered the honey/moonshine/tea cocktail. It was good; something I'd recreate at home. I'm not sure why other reviewers are so in love with Midwood. Maybe I just miss the sauce.",

I knew the Charlotte area had some great BBQ places, even had a couple of go-to's myself. Well, I thought I did! Until today, March 25th, I realized that I hadn't experienced the area's best BBQ! Midwood does it all and does it well! From the start you notice every server with a upbeat, charming, and eager to get you anything kinda attitude! Mine, Lorilee, was incredibly prompt, charming, and personable! From the time the Smoked Wings hit the table I knew this was special! Ordered dry with sauce on the side, these wings were smokey, plump, juicy, and the best wings in Charlotte hands down! To not feel too guilty, I ordered the Brisket Salad which made me feel ridiculously guilty! Full of tender brisket, smokey corn, real bacon, black beans, avocado, fresh lettuce, and fresh tomatoes! Incredibly good it was indeed! Then came the small Pulled Pork platter which had more meat than I'd first thought. Tender, juicy, flavorful, and though tossed in Eastern sauce it didn't disappoint. The side of Baked Beans had some pulled pork, possible bacon, and perhaps burnt ends in it which made it the highlight of the meal. Yes a side item stole the show which should tell you that they aren't just concentrating on the meats! I regret that I'll never step foot in my two favorites in Charlotte again, but hey, step up to Midwood's game!",

Since I'm in Charlotte I felt like I needed to revisit it and hit up Macs my first night out, got a tip from a local yelper (thx Greg) and made our way up to Midwood.   So I order the sample platter with the choice of four meats, we get the ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken instead of the sausage. Wife and I got the same meal (almost) at Macs. Can I settle the score? Just like it takes an out of towner to decide between Genos/Pats (it's Pats) Midwood is the better of the two. Not a blowout, but enough to pick a winner, would have picked the sausage over the chicken as neither of us were crazy about it. As people have noted, get those bacon jalapenos as both of your sides. Yowza.  Why not 5 stars? Sorry pal that's reserved for Pappys in St Louis or Central BBQ in Memphis. Midwood is a solid pick and am glad we got to hit it up during our stay here.",

The food took a while to come out but with orders for eight people that's totally forgivable.  The pulled chicken had decent texture but not a great deal of smoke flavor to it - the SC-style mustard sauce had a real acidic hit to it that worked nicely with the meat. BBQ beans were on the sweet side but well-made and packed with flavor. Hush puppies and pickled onions on the side were fine. $8 for this.  I will happily go back and sample more of their meats and sauce styles - they also have 'traditional' BBQ sauce, East NC vinegar-based sauce, and some habanero effort.  This place came highly recommended by locals and I can understand why. Very impressive at a low price point.",

    "text": "We ordered takeout from here a while back, ordered a large BBQ chicken plate for $12 with mac and cheese and BBQ baked beans as out 2 sides. Ordering was easy, we actually ordered about 30 minutes before closing but whoever answered the phone was extremely understanding and polite. He said the plate would take about 20 minutes to make. We ended up picking up our food 10 minutes after close, they were still very pleasant about it. We brought our boxes home to find a crazy amount of BBQ chicken, score! It was delicious too, the South Carolina Mustard sauce it is tossed it is delish! There was so much, that we used the left overs to make BBQ chicken sandwiches the next day. I wasn't a huge fan of the mac and cheese, it was kinda dry, but I blame myself for ordering so late. I assume it was the last batch of the day. Will have to try it fresh, I'm sure it won't disappoint. The hush puppies were also good as well, love the jalapeno addition, I wish we were given more lol. The large BBQ chicken plate really was a large, the two of us couldn't even finish it in one sitting.   Although, they really need to make it clear that there is red meat in the bbq beans. I was a little disappointed I couldn't eat them. But, we will be back for a sit down because the rest of the food was soo damn good! The salmon entree sounds soooo good. Cheers!",

    "text": "Midwood Smokehouse seems to be the quintessential Urban Bro Restaurant.  Every big business town with lots of transplants has to have at least a few.    The large crowd on a nice Sunday evening was probably about 70 percent male, which sounds about right for a restaurant serving this much meat.  A sizeable minority of the clientele consisted of the following two Urban Bro subspecies:  (1) dudes wearing pressed khaki shorts with overly bright tucked-in polo shirts, loafers without socks, and snappy golf visors (looking like they just stepped off of a Southern college campus circa 1987), and (2) dudes wearing baggy athletic shorts, athletic sandals (with or without socks), and t-shirts with logos from athletic companies (looking like they'd just stepped off a college campus circa 2014).  There were also a small handful of heavily tatted-up goateed dudes with backward baseball caps and wife-beaters (looking like they were trying to channel Fred Durst circa 2001).    Everybody else looked pretty much like normal adults.  To pull in the Urban Bro demographic, Midwood Smokehouse has even more giant TVs than average--most tuned to tuned to sports, of course--than the average meat-centric restaurant.  (But to confirm that we were in a sophisticated urban environment, and not some exurban barnyard, the TVs tuned to all-news showed vanilla CNN rather than Fox News!)  There is also an unwritten Midwood Smokehouse rule that any dude having a beer and/or BBQ solo at the bar, or waiting for a take-out order, is required to have his attention glued to a smartphone at almost all times, with small breaks allowed to eat food or catch golf action on the nearest giant TV.  The music?  Classic rock.  (What else would be possible to balance the various Urban Bro demographic subgroups?)  Besides the social anthropological amusement, Midwood Smokehouse serves up good food, too.  Chopped pork was certainly better than average, although not in the same league as the whole-hog stuff you can get in some small towns in this state.  Frankly, it was a bit salty, and the pork flavor just wasn't all that bold.  (Before you blast somebody with an Ohio address for even daring to talk about NC BBQ, I present the following defense:  I was born in NC, my dad's family is still anchored in this state, and both sides of my wife's family hail from this state.  But at the same time, I don't pretend to be any kind of BBQ expert.  I only justify my right to opine.)  Before we left, I got the impression that the burnt ends are what you get here, but they were sold out when we got there.    More impressive were the sides, which are just an afterthought at too many BBQ places everywhere.  Smoked veggies are a nice idea, and the collard greens were just the way I like them:  leafy, not overcooked, and suffused with plenty of smoky meat flavor.  Because this is a big urban restaurant, serving only BBQ won't do:  The menu also features burgers, sandwiches, salads, tacos, and more.  Decent selection of draft beer, too.  A word to the wise:  The $13 large BBQ plate might sound expensive at first glance, but it is a very generous portion of food.  You probably don't need to go that way, unless you're very large and/or haven't eaten all day.",

But here's why I really appreciated Smokehouse and gave you 5 stars.  The coleslaw and hush puppies were fresh, delicious and had some thought behind them.  I feel like with lots of BBQ places they spend so much time on the meat that the sides and (god forbid!) the hush puppies are a ho-hum afterthought.  Not so here.  Bravo.  --Oh wait, but I didn't give you 5 stars and here's why...  The reason you don't get 5 stars from me is because of the kid's food.  We ordered chicken fingers and mac-n-cheese for our 3 year old.  My food philosophy with kids is that they are basically small adults and shouldn't be coddled to with garbage, dumbed-down, obviously-from-a-bag chicken fingers.  You guys clearly respect meat so how's about making something good for the kiddos? --Something less spicy and less seasoned than the grown up choices but still actual good food...not frozen junk.",

    "text": "Can't believe I'm just now reviewing Midwood Smokehouse. Having BBQ aplenty in Crown Town, you've got competing businesses who want that coveted, smoky place on your palate. I'm happy to say that Scibelli has done it yet again!  The locale on Central Ave is a bit tricky for parking. Pulling into the compact lot amongst other cars whizzing by on their way to Uptown can be a bit of a hassle, but it's all worth the struggle. Parking on the street is available, too. Be mindful of your space. Be sure you don't inhabit private spaces or any of the adjacent businesses lots as it my result in towing.   Venture in to the cozy dining room, patio or rooftop and treat yourself to the bacon-wrapped jalapenos. I can barely muster enough words to describe their culinary beauty. Smokey, cheesy, spicy, bacon-y glory. If you're sitting at a table amongst bacon lovers, more than one order will be required. They go fast.   If you're in the mood for a sandwich, the Superbird is wonderful. Smoked turkey, ham, bacon, avocado mayo, tomato on a texas toast. I'd get it again in a heartbeat.   The brisket is great. You can order a lean plate, if you're not wanting the fattier, yet more tasy, cut.   The sides are where it hits home. Creamed corn that is out of this world. Spot on mac n' cheese, greens like mama used to make and smoked veggies. You can even order 4 as a meal for $9!  Do yourself a favor and order hush puppies, too. Fantastic flavor and crunchy texture paired with their tangy BBQ sauce.   The service is splendid. Friendly, fast, and very knowledgeable of the menu. Great job to our server Ben!  Look forward to each visit. These guys are making a name for BBQ in Plaza! Cheers!",

It was very busy so we sat at the bar.  I had the pork sandwich with cole slaw and fries.  My wife had the brisket with hush puppies.  Everything was great!  Fast service too.  We took a few hush puppies home and our dog loved them too.  My only complaint is they don't have a variety of sauces available in self service bottles.   I like to mix and match my BBQ sauces and try different combinations.  That's part of the fun of a BBQ place imho.  Nevertheless, the food here is delicious.

The parking lot was packed but we found parking on the back side of the building. We decided to split the 'Well Fed' combo with ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket. It didn't look like much food at first but ended up being enough for 2. The ribs were definitely the winner of the day. So tender and tangy; bbq'ed to perfection! Next up was the brisket, a little fatty but good nonetheless. The pulled pork was next; very tender and flavorful. I didn't really care for the pulled chicken. It lacked tenderness and flavor in my opinion. The Mac n cheese was delicious! Very cheesy! The sweet potato fries were tasty and crunchy. I definitely recommend giving this place a try. Our waitress was great. The space was great and there looked to be a rooftop deck as well.",

    "text": "This place is AMAZING!  So good that we actually chose to eat dinner here two times in our four night visit to Charlotte.  The second time we brought two other people with us.    First night we sat inside at a big booth and the waitress was absolutely fantastic.  She was friendly and accomodating.  One of the best!  We shared a big pig out combo platter with pork burnt ends, jalapeno/cheddar sausage, mix of lean and fatty brisket and Carolina pork.  The Carolina pork is actually what brought us to this place to begin with.  Which is funny because the restaurant is more Texas style and the Carolina pork is much smokier with no real mustard/vinegar flavor on the meat itself.  As sides we had bacon wrapped jalapenos and baked beans.  Everything was so good.  The sausage was cold and a bit greasy so we didn't get that the second time.  The brisket is likely the best I have ever had.  The pork was delicious and smoky.  The jalapenos had hard cheese in the middle but were fine.  The baked beans were amazing and that isn't usually something I would choose.  Even the hush puppies that came with the meal were well done and yummy.  I didn't love the sweet tea but it was mild and well made.  The second night we stuck with the same combo platter but tried the burnt ends (as an add on $5 plate), chicken and ribs in addition to the brisket and pork.  The chicken was so good.  I'm actually not a big chicken eater and I wouldn't have even realized it was chicken.  The ribs were also a must get.  So yummy and the texture was spot on.  Tried the mac and cheese and creamed corn, both were just okay.  Had a blackberry cocktail that was good but not worth even the discounted price that night.  Oh, the water was terrible so found I had to order a Diet Coke to have something to wash the food down with.  Second night we sat outside and the patio isn't that nice and the service wasn't as good but it was still an enjoyable night.  One of our friends got the smoked 1/2 chicken and was happy with it.  If we ever make it back to Charlotte you can bet we will be eating here!",

I ordered the Dixie Chicken Salad, and holy moly was it a HUGE amount of food. It's crammed with greens, toppings, an avocado, pulled chicken that was a little dry, and delicious chipotle ranch dressing. The BF ordered burnt ends, which comes with complimentary pickled onions (white, not red, so they weren't my fave!) and hush puppies, as well as your choice of side! He choose bacon-wrapped jalapenos per our server's suggestion, and even though they were tasty, we were only served three small pieces and it left us wanting more. Banana pudding was decent, but I'm spoiled by my favorite in Chicago.   Overall, a total hot spot for Carolina BBQ. I'm not completely sold, but it was better than greasy food after a couple of flights.",

Other than that the place is great. Decent service. Burnt ends are always my go to so I strongly recommend them. Bacon wrapped jalapenos are great as well as pimento cheese fries with pulled pork.

Poor J has to listen to me every time. He's always like, are you done yet?  Midwood is so solid. I absolutely love their smoked chicken on top and have also enjoyed the pork. Service is usually pretty good here, too, which I feel is always hit or miss at a BBQ place.  On the weekends, be prepared to wait. They offer a couple (literally, like 2) brunch options on the weekend, which sometimes I wish was expanded, but I have to remember its a BBQ spot first and foremost, not a breakfast place.  We have also ordered takeout from here for a small group and it was a hit. Word of advice: over-order on the wings...they will be the first to go!  Okay it's only 7:45 a.m. as I write this and I know I just wrote about how I wish they did breakfast, but now I am really just craving BBQ.",

Midwood is different from a lot of the local Texas options.  For one thing, Midwood offers table service and serves their meat on a plate instead of butcher paper.    But the important thing is the food.  The brisket is excellent and would compete well in Texas.  The sauce is tasty and they offer a variety of sauces.  I also liked my fries and hush puppies.  If I had one gripe at all, it would be that the St. Louis style ribs would've benefited from a bit more time in the smoker.   On a final note, our service was excellent and truly embodied southern hospitality.    If you're going to eat bbq outside of Texas, Midwood is the place to eat it.  And I am now a convert to the cause of serving hush puppies with bbq.",

We had a modest wait for a table and were seated and served quickly by friendly staff. The food was excellent (save room for the banana pudding which is amazing) and the server was friendly and helpful. I really can't say anything bad about the food or the service.   The reason I decided to review it this time is because it is the LAST time I will be eating at this location. Friday night, there was no parking, at all, on the Midwood side of the street. We had to park in the lot across the street. This is where things got really dangerous.   We waited and crossed appropriately but a huge, white monstrosity of a truck decided to make a left turn and not yield to pedestrians! I was in the middle of the road and it came barreling toward me stopping INCHES from my body!!! I screamed and dropped my purse literally frozen in fear. I ran across the rest of the street as fast as I could and was barely able to enjoy my meal because of the scare crossing the street. The truck didn't even stop to see if I was okay.  If you plan to eat at this location, plan to Uber or Lyft and don't even think about crossing that damned road with or without a light. I gave this review four stars because the food was excellent but the nonexistent safe parking means I will not have the pleasure of eating here again... but I'm very thankful to be alive and unharmed. #pedestrianlivesmatter",

Tried the Carolina Chopped Pork, Beef Brisket, St. Louis Style Pork RIbs, and the Pulled Chicken BBQ. My favorites were the Beef Brisket and Ribs for sure. The brisket was so tender and had great flavor and the ribs were fall off the bone delicious! For the sides we went with Collard Greens, Mac and Cheese, Baked Beans, and Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos - all of them were great! Loved the bacon wrapped jalapenos and the collard greens the most. They also have a nice selection of local draft beers. Service was great, a little on the slower side at first, but I think that's because we lagged and took a while to decide on our order.

My fiance had the Texas hash which is their Sunday special. The Texas hash had fried onions, pepper, fried eggs, Texas toast, brisket and avocado. The Texas hash was packed with flavor, the brisket itself was really flavorful in it. I had the half rack of ribs. The ribs were out of this world they offered two different sauces for the ribs, one was a  habanero bbq sauce and then a sweeter tomato bbq sauce it was hard to choose which one they were both really good. For sides we tried the coleslaw, Mac and cheese, and bbq baked beans. However, I would not recommend the Mac and cheese, very plain and didn't really have flavor the noodles were also tough. However, the baked beans were really good. Then we also tried the banana pudding, it was only 2.50. It was amazing, don't forget to try that.  I wish I remembered our waitresses name, but she was really friendly and went out of her way to explain everything to us considering it was our first time. Highly recommend this place. Will come back when we are back in town.",

We started with the Pimento Fries which were very good. We ordered 2 entree's.  One was the Upstrem Salad with Salmon which was incredible. The other was the Hickory Smoked Salmon which I liked very much. It ordered with a side of Mac & Cheese which was pretty good. I like mine a bit more \"wet\" that what is prepared here though.  The portion size of both the Pimento Fries and Salmon Salad was huge! We could have just ordered these and left satisfied!  Wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. At one point the manager even checked in on us to make sure we did not need anything and that we were enjoying our dinner.   We only eat fish but I can see that this would be a meat eaters paradise!!",

We went on a really busy Saturday afternoon when the place was absolutely packed by only had to wait about 5-10 mins for a table.  Midwood is pretty huge and they're efficient with service so I don't think you'd ever have to wait too long (unless you had a massive group).  Service was excellent - our server kindly explained everything to us. We ended up sharing the taster BBQ plate and everything was phenomenal but it was ALOT of food. We are big eaters, but it totally defeated us. Most of the meat was spot on- I think the pulled pork was just a bit dry. The burnt ends were really delicious and so was the brisket.   Price was very reasonable and the decor is so fun and eclectic. The whole place has an awesome buzz about it.  Definitely recommended.",

My boyfriend and I shared the well fed platter where we got pulled pork, smoked chicken, ribs and brisket. Our two sides were mac and cheese and collard greens. The BBQ was a little too smoky flavored for me and the chicken was very bland. I did like their sauces though. The mac and cheese and collard greens were both great. I will say if you're going with someone else, the platter is the way to go. That way you get to try a little of everything. We also started with the hogapeno dip and bbq queso. Neither were anything exceptional.   They were slammed on a Sunday night so we had to wait for a little bit. Rachel took great care of us, and kept checking back to see when more burnt ends would be done since they were out when we arrived. The manager on duty was very active on the floor and visited our table almost as much as our server. You could tell she was constantly helping the servers out and checking on tables.   They had some sandwiches and burgers that looked really good, and I would go that route next time. They also have a great beer list although I didn't partake on this particular visit.   I thought overall the price of everything was high. One small portion of meat and a side for upwards of $11? There are many places you can get a lot more for your money and its just as good if not better.",

Our waitress (whose name I wish I remembered) was extremely prompt & courteous with a great sense of humour. Our drinks never got below half empty because she was always just close enough nearby to provide excellent service, without hovering. I highly recommend the \"burnt ends\" which are not burnt at all, but perfectly cooked to be nice and crispy on the outside whole being tender & juicy on the inside. This will definitely become part of my regular rotation of great barbecue joints in Charlotte. The hush puppies were also fantastic; very well done with just the right amount of crunchy while bursting with flavour. They offer many different regional styles of barbecue, so you're almost guaranteed to find something you'll love. Excellent portion sizes, also. I tried my darnedest, but could not clean my plate.",

Honestly, this place isn't really my first preference (I think twice about eating here even if I'm right across from this place) because I'm not a fan of barbecue and almost everything I eat here makes me feel guilty about introducing my body to so much grease and fat. But my boyfriend is crazy about this place and so I eat here more often than I otherwise would. In fact if it wasn't for him, I probably would have never been here. But when I do eat, I enjoy my meal.  Their brisket (as I chanted before) is really good. You can get it lean or fatty. Of course I pick lean. And my meal is never complete without the fried mac-n-cheese and bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers on the side. The hushpuppies are pretty good too. My boyfriend also loved the burnt ends (I haven't tried those, but I trust his opinion) and pulled pork. I'm not a big fan of their seating. I don't know what it is, but I'm always uncomfortable here. The metal chairs and tables aren't the most comfortable, and patio seating is a little tight.",

    "text": "We walked in with a group of 10 -- on a Saturday night at 7:45, not the best strategy. But we were seated in only 20 minutes at two tables (6+4) -- probably as good as we could have hoped for. The staff was very accommodating and friendly from the moment we stepped in.  The beer selection was good, solid -- just fine for casual dinner. Our table had fried pickles for an appetizer and they were delicious -- crispy on the outside and cut on the diagonal to give lots of area for dipping.  The barbecue I had was incredible. Their brisket can stand up to anything I've had in a Texas restaurant. I had their signature sauce which was a smoky, sweet & tangy (more tang than sweet) mixture, on a combination of lean and fatty brisket. I was floored by how delicious it was. I also had the bacon-wrapped jalapenos as a side. Do be cautious with these -- they vary in terms of hotness (seeds, most likely). The first I had was mild and the second knocked me for a loop! But totally enjoyable. The collard greens were also solid -- not mind-blowing, but very good. The portions were very generous and there's no way to leave this place hungry after a platter.  A dining companion, in fact, ordered a platter and couldn't begin to finish his pulled pork. He offered me a taste. It was tossed in the spicy BBQ sauce already. I had a few mouthfuls, and they were exquisite. I wish I'd been able to taste with the vinegary NC sauce I love so much -- maybe next time!  The service was excellent and our waitress brought a smile to the table every time she came by to check on our progress and offer refills. I was so full of good cheer and barbecue that I was halfway planning already to come back the next night. Definitely worth a visit for a casual dinner with friends -- I would love to come back next time I'm in town.",

The smoked wings are ungodly good. I am not the type that normally orders an appetizer but I got these on chance because we were waiting for a friend to show up for dinner. They were so good that I make sure to get an order and opt for a smaller dinner to fit them in. Not that skipping dinner is any better. I did not see anything special in the pulled pork, though it is pretty good and not too dry. But the smoked veggies as a side are delicious and worth skipping the fries. The rack of ribs is also out of this world and I might start ordering that instead of the pulled pork. It is very flavorful.

We were in a bit of wind tunnel because the overhead fans were on full blast.  I then  realized that was a good thing; since they actually smoke the meat, the fans help circulate the declicious smell.  We wanted to try everything, so we split a Well-Fed Combo Platter and got the pulled pork, beef brisket, ribs and hickory smoked sausage.  (I can't imagine how many people the Pig Out size would feed!)  It came with three sauces: mustard, vinegar and the tomato-based Midwood sauce.  The pork and sausage were great, but fairly standard; the brisket and ribs were phenomenal. The ribs fell off the bone, and the brisket was tender enough to cut with a fork.  We also got mac & cheese (great) and bacon-wrapped jalapenos (just ok).  Our server was very attentive and fun, and we rolled out of there miserably, happily full.",

I love the Salmon Sammie, grilled cheese,(be sure to add the beef brisket) and of course the sweet potato fries..they are to die for!!!  You can split a half rack of ribs easily with another person, the portion is that big! We come at least once a week and have never left disappointed!!",

Everything had that perfect authentic wood-smoked flavor and the sauces weren't even necessary, but took it to the next level of flavor. The brisket was as good as the reviews amped up, moist and smoky more than meaty flavor. Pork and ribs incredible as well. Collards perfectly cooked and not bitter at all. All so worth it, I could go back everyday. Price reasonable for the quantity of food. Service great. Cool mural outside.  Can't recommend enough! All rubs and sauces gf too.",

Even though they were busy, the food came not and timely. The 1/2 roasted chicken, brisket, chopped salad, Mac & cheese, greens, and hushpuppies were fantastic! I just enjoyed it all. However, the banana pudding although tasty didnt seem fresh. The bananas were already gray/brown and slightly slimey...um, yall need to fix that ASAP lol- That's the only reason its not 5 stars.

The restaurant vibe is less of your old-timey country kitchen and more of a casual-hip roadhouse feel with a touch of junkyard.  The bacon wrapped jalapenos appetizers are usually a fan favorite of my group. I always like to order from the classic BBQ plates section, with the mixed fatty and lean beef brisket leading the way. The more fun and recommended selection is to go with a combo platter to share with a friend(s)! You get to mix it up and find your own favorite taste.  Drinks are plentiful with many cold beers and crafty cocktail selections. There are multiple dining spaces to accommodate for different occasions. Importantly, the wait staff have always been friendly and fun, eager to give you popular recommendations.",

All of it was fantastic.  The burnt ends were the highlight followed up by the ribs. The meats had so much flavor,  which we were told was due to a wood burning smoker that ran 24 hrs a day.  We were told this was one of the few True wood burning smokers in town, which, if True is enough reason to eat here.  As for sides, all great with the stand outs being the super creamy mac & cheese and the bacon wrapped jalapenos.  They had roughly 10 local beers on the menu plus all your standard options. Desserts were good, but not the highlight.",

Located in a very cute area and with outdoor seating, midwood smokehouse was a cute little bbq place which serves a variety of BBQ items. We first ordered the fried pickles! Which comes with a dipping sauce of ranch dressing. The fried pickles had a distinct taste more salty than sour! But dipped in a side of ranch made it taste better!  I went for the beef brisket and a size (small) 6oz of meat, along with the Mac and cheese! While my bf chose the BBQ tips with two sides, grilled vegetables and the bacon wrapped jalapeno.   My beef brisket was juicy and good but the fan above our table just made my brisket cold immediately! So I had to eat quick! The Mac and cheese was good, came out bubbly and hot! I got to try some of my bf's BBQ beef tips and they were so dry! And hard to chew. It wasn't a good choice . The grilled vegetables quickly became cold and the only thing he liked on the plates were the bacon jalapeno!   Both our plates came with hush puppies too! And they were good, but I was so full from eating the brisket that I could only eat two of the hush puppies!",

While the fatty piece was truly fatty, it blended well with the lean to provide a very satisfying taste. Even though I love brisket and BBQ, the large 10oz serving was pretty hefty.  6oz serving of pork or brisket appeared to satisfy my entire party so keep in mind that the bigger platter comes with the extra side so that could also factor in your decision of 6oz versus 10oz or heck - possibly even share a 10oz platter with a friend.  Bacon wrapped jalapenos could easily make an appetizer menu at any bar or restaurant across the country. It truly was the hidden gem on my platter. It wasn't that spicy and bacon wrapped anything.... well, it's just plain cool and great!  Mac & cheese was enjoyable.  Staff was awesome with service & refills. She was quick to make recommendations and the manager came by to ask how we were doing and thanked us for stopping in.  Definitely felt the Southern hospitality at Midwood!",

    "text": "This is a mixed feeling 3 star review because I wanted to love this place so bad after hearing everything about it. I almost want to say a real 2/12 but I guess 3 will work.  First we got a warm welcome, interior is nice, cool looking bar, nice tables, overall good feel inside of the restaurant. Our server was cool, yet a bit awkward. He did his job well, but when asked questions about how some of the meat was prepped, he kinda seemed to be caught off guard.  One big thing I learned, which was a huge turnoff for me was that all pulled pork, no matter how you order it (platter, sandwich) is pulled and put right into their vinegar sauce.  Yes, they will give you other sauces with it, but the vinegar still bites right through, and that is a huge turnoff for me, and 3 out of 4 of the people at my table did not order pork because of that.  Otherwise, I got brisket (both lean and fatty) was excellent, sides were all good. My wife liked her mac & cheese. In laws loved their chicken sandwiches though thought they were a bit dry, alas with more sauce very good.  Would I come back? yes. Would I ask more questions about how the bbq is prepped and cooked? yes. It seemed our waiter was a bit confused. But our drinks were filled all the time, and food was delivered and check on is a reasonable amount of time. So he did his job well.",

    "text": "Ate there on Mothers Day and NO WAIT for seating or food this time! YEA! I got the Cuban sandwich (I AM Cuban, from Miami) which was a fair sandwich for being done in NC, but NOT a True Cuban sandwich. Still, it WAS tasty and huge and the bread (which waiter told me is flown in daily from Tampa) was the best! I got the coleslaw as my side...decent slaw, not vinegar, not milky type. My son got the pork plate with mac n cheese and slaw sides. He is a strapping young man, hungry...and the portions filled him well. We got one of the bacon wrapped jalapeno appetizers and they are decent, too. Ours were cold when served, but tasty and I will go by and get them 'as a meal' from now on. Their margarita is tasty...enough alcohol and good tasting mix. Son got two different beers, one the Blue Moon, the other I didn't sample as I was driving. We'd sat on the patio in the evening before it got dark...nice! We'd go back again. I did notice that you can get a plate of sides, differing amounts, and I often eat strange like that (gastric bypass past). That way I'd have several meals of several healthy foods, but I'll be a regular bacon wrapped jalapenos peep IF they'll cook them to order so I get them HOT.",

We also ordered bourbon slush (not quite sure of the name) drinks. OMG drinks were so delicious! I didn't try the wings, but the fried pickles were good.  For dinner I had the brisket (I ordered 'both' - fatty and lean). Brisket was SO good. My friends ordered the BBQ chicken and the pulled pork. The pork was a bit disappointing, not sure if it was the sauce we didn't like but it just tasted a little off. The chicken was good, but the real standout was the brisket - I'd definitely recommend that. We wanted to try to the banana pudding but we were so full after all of the food. So, we will have to return for some pudding and ribs!",

    "text": "Went to this place BECAUSE of all the yelp reviews, so had to come share our experience. First off our waiter, John V was amazing! Knowledgable, personable and on point! He recommended the bacon wrapped jalapenos for an appetizer, they were awesome! I don't do spicy and I truly enjoyed these. He then explained the different meats and how everything was prepared, so we ended up ordering the pig out ( I think that's what it was called - 4 meats, 2 sides ) we got the pork, chicken, ribs and brisket, along with the Mac and cheese and creamed corn John recommended. The sides were phenomenal!! The chicken was beyond fabulous, second I'd say pork, then ribs and finally the brisket - all was great, but not being a big meat eater I'm a bad judge on the harder ones. Also not a fan of NC BBQ \"sauce\" - but it was good here, very mellow. Sadly Sunday early afternoon became VERY busy so our pecan cobbler never came out, so after waiting so long we canceled the order. Love this place!",

Love the atmosphere, decor and ambiance of the place; the owner came by to check on us. Entire staff was so friendly! Every bite we had was great, thanks Yelpers! The waitress improvised a \"little bit of everything\" platter for the 3 of us, and I have to say I loved the mac n chz, coleslaw and all of the meats. The brisket was a bit more fatty than I am used to here in Texas, but the flavor was wonderful. I am not a sausage person, but those bacon wrapped jalapenos stuffed with \"conglomerate meat\", as I call it..were very good! Fried pickles hot and crispy; perfect partner for a drink! The men had beer, but I had a special \"Tea\" they made (its on the drink menu), and loved it.  We will Definitely be back to Midwood Smokehouse and enjoyed sitting outdoors.  This entire neighborhood is full of cool bars and places to eat.!",

    "text": "I saw that a new BBQ place had opened up and had to go try it.  I ate lunch there on a Saturday just a little before noon.  The restaurant was nice, with an industrial feel to it, but very well done.  It had your standard decorations.  The place is kind of narrow, but the arrangement worked well for the space with a mixture of booths & high top tables.  The do have a deck outside with seats.  There were maybe one or two tables when I got there, so I could pretty much sit anywhere.  My server took my drink order and when she came back I asked if they had any sort of combo platter where I could try a little of each meat.  She said they might and went to check for me.  After a couple of minutes a different server came back and said they don't currently have a combo platter, but he showed me a new menu with it.  It was a choice of 4 meats & two sides.  I chose chicken, ribs, pork & brisket with baked beans and coleslaw for my sides.  It took a while for my food to come out.  When Peter, my server brought it out, the plate was enormous.  It had a  chicken, breast & wing, 5 ribs, a pile of chopped pork & a couple of slices of brisket.  There were also some hush puppies and pickled onions on the plate.  The sides where served in soup cups and there was also a plate with three different sauces.  Peter went over everything explaining the different types of sauces.  There was a vinegar based, mustard based, and a tomato based sauce.  The brisket was sliced thick with a bit of fat in it.  The pork was chopped fine and mixed with a little of the mustard based sauce.  The ribs were served dry and the chicken had some of the mustard based sauce on it.    The brisket was tender and juicy with a nice dark bark on it.  When I first tried the bark I thought it might have been a little over smoked, but with more of the meat it was had a very nice balance.  My only complaint on the brisket was that it was sliced with the grain instead of across it.  The brisket was cooked long enough that it was still tender, but cut correctly it would have been better.    The pork was awesome!  Very tender and moist with a nice flavor.  The mustard sauce was a nice compliment to the pork.  I tried some of the vinegar based sauce, but didn't care for it as much as the mustard based.  The ribs were a little undercooked, but still tender enough with a nice flavor.  The ribs would have been much better with about another hour or two of cooking.  The chicken was tender and moist with a good flavor.  Nothing too special about it, but it was still good.  The baked beans had a nice flavor and had pieces of meat mixed in with them.  They also had chunks of onion and pepper.  There was a seasoning, like oregano or coriander, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  It was a different and I couldn't quite decide if it worked on not, but it must have since I ate most of them.  The coleslaw was meh, but you don't go to BBQ places just for the coleslaw.  The service was awesome here, Peter noticed when he brought my food out that the brisket had some fat on it so he brought a plate with some lean brisket, a little more pork and a slice of sausage for me to try.   I've tried a lot of the BBQ places in Charlotte since I've been here and Midwood Smokehouse is at the top of the list if not the best.  The price was very good for the amount of food as well, $16 for the combo plate.  With the extra meat Peter brought I couldn't finish it all, which is saying something.  With great service and reasonable prices I will be back.",

Charlotte has had it's share of BBQ places over the years - some local joints and others where chains. None have really wowed me like Midwood Smokehouse. Out of the dozen or so times I have eaten there it has been consistently delicious. I go there specifically for the beef brisket. It is quite literally the best brisket I have ever had and the kind you think about long after you have finished your meal. I usually get the half and half (half lean, half fat). The flavor of the bark from whatever magical rub they are using should be deemed a national treasure and samples of it should be put in the Smithsonian to celebrate its greatness. The word is out and this place is quickly becoming the hot spot for BBQ in the Charlotte region. So much so that seating has been a problem. But not anymore. They just expanded and opened a new section of the restaurant to seat more people. In a way that makes me sad because I wanted this place all to myself.",

    "text": "I like it...wife does not.  It is very popular and can get notoriously crowded, especially on the weekend evenings.  The noise will do you in, which is why my wife will not come again.  And you will have a long wait on those evenings.  I go, usually for lunch, with friends during the weekdays.  The BBQ Queso (cheese mixed with pork or beef brisket or plain)  yum, yum and their version of bacon wrapped jalapenos.  Delicious, but make sure that they really cook them to get the bacon crisp and the cheese melted inside the peppers.  Great appetizers, both of them.  It's a BBQ joint, but they do have salads.  And uniquely, you can build your own salads from their ingredients.   Pretty clever and I never would have noticed except when a friend's wife was a veggie person and she was very happy.  Made me wonder why they were OK doing a BBQ lunch.  The sandwiches are basically BBQ on bread and are pretty common.  The entrees are also the common beef brisket, pulled pork, etc.  One key thing whether you are having beef brisket on bread or on a plate:  you can specify lean, fatty or both.  Nice...however, the fatty are REALLY fatty, having a quarter to half inch strip of fat on your slices.  I know some people eat all the fat on meat; but I do not.  Maybe that is you, so you are safer to go lean or the a mix, especially if you would like a little fat.  There are meat combination plates, which are an excellent option, and lots of sides.  My dad was a mac and cheese aficionado, so he would always go for the mac n' cheese, even as his entree for lunch.  It is very rich and will fill your growling tummy.  Bar is great...just be prepared to wait as it is the busiest place catering to those waiting as well as those seated.  The bar staff is in a constant hustle.  Enjoyable place, when not crowded, so go.  You might see me eating by myself at the bar.",

We got a half rack of St. Louis ribs with the dry rub and the Texas hash that was on special. Everything was good. The hush puppies were really little and you only get a few of them. The smoked veggies side was very oily and was nothing special. The ribs were cooked really well, falling off the bone.   The hash came with 2 slices of sourdough toast buttered and was topped with two fried eggs and a half of an avocado sliced. It had great flavor but the brisket was really fatty. The hash is a good greasy breakfast/brunch meal for sure.",

My table was ready but I couldn't be seated without half my party there and my coworkers were late arriving.  The hostess was very accommodating and didn't give away my table.  Service was OK.  Our appetizers arrived before our drinks.  My drink was $3 off for the daily drink special and the contents reflected that... barely any alcohol, and pretty much a cup of crished ice water.  I ordered the burnt ends with Mac n cheese and collard greens.  The burnt ends were really good but the sides were just OK.  Some commented the collard greens needed to be drained as there was too much liquid.  The hush puppies had good flavor and were the perfect bite size.    A big disappointment at the table was that they ran out of ribs while we were ordering.  It was probably around 7:30 p.m. Apparently, they run out of ribs every night.  They smoke meat on a daily basis and sell what they have until they run out.  For those who ordered the combo plate that comes with ribs, they were asked what they wanted in place of the ribs.  My coworker picked burnt ends and then was up charged for it.  They were not told it would cost more and I think it's ridiculous since they were picking something else because what was part of the entree was not available by the restaurant.",

Me and my boyfriend are huge fans of BBQ and have tasted multiple places to get. The wait time wasn't long so that was pretty great. However, it took then a whole hour to take our food out. I was so disappointed because we had to eat so fast. In addition, the food wasn't my favorite. I honestly think the food was ok but not the best I have eaten. The waiter was sweet and ended up giving us a free dessert because of the wait that ended up being the best thing of the night. I wouldn't recommend coming here.

They had a little kick to them! Very tasty!   I took the bartender's advice and got the \"burnt ends\" which are amazing nuggets of carmelized brisket with BBQ sauce. I am not a huge beef fan but I could be if I had this meal choice available to me all the time. So incredibly tender and delicious. And oh my goodness those BBQ beans! A must have. I also got to try some of my dinner mates collard greens. A first for me. They kind of tasted like spinach with a thicker texture. Not bad! Oh and those hush puppies. I never really had a hush puppy that I thought tasted good. I didn't realize why people even ate those until now!!   The ginger lemon jack drink was so yummy! Great food and great service!  I'm so full and happy right now.",

We came in at around 11:30AM on a Friday and there were already plenty people there. There's two main inside dining area so the restaurant can accommodate quite a few people. We barely waited before we got seated.  We had already had breakfast not too long ago, and we weren't ready to stuff ourselves with more BBQ. We wanted to try some ribs and some burnt ends, but we couldn't combine ribs in the combo option!  Our waiter was very friendly and provided us his suggestions and opinions on the dishes. He had also offered us an option to combine some dishes so we get to try everything we wanted without over ordering. We ended up with the perfect amount of food without having to take any to-go or force ourselves to finish!   At the end of the meal, our waiter knew that we were traveling from afar and probably didn't have enough water (it was also a very hot day). He ended up getting us two cups of water to go so that we could stay hydrated. Great service and great food!",

    "text": "And this is why I am fat. For real. Pimento cheese fries topped with brisket? You have got to be kidding me.  Between the beer, fries, BBQ sampler and banana pudding (yes, dessert too) it didnt take long for me to start hating myself. The only redemption I had was that everything we ordered was shared- but still.  I really love pimento, its a little weird and I think you have to get used to it, but it was sooo good on the crinkle fries. The little char from the broil just made it better, and topping it with brisket put it way over the top to the gluttonous side. So obviously I liked it!  For our shared main we split the sampler, where we had a chance to try their smoked meats along with some sides. The smoked veggies were awesome- one of the more surprising flavors of what we ordered-and I would order double of those next time. I got the mac and cheese as our second side, but after those fries that was way too heavy and too much cheese. Out of the two, the fries win hands down.  Meat wise I preferred the pulled pork and the chicken, though everything was quite good! I've got a thing for banana pudding so if I see it I order it, and I am keeping a mental list of best ones around the country. This one comes in third place! Yum! (Magnolia's in NYC is still in first place, if you are curious).  Everything here was good, but not mindblowing. I was also a little underwhelmed by the service and the bar staff, they were not very attentive (no, it was not very busy). We also had to send two things back, one was incorrect and the other cold (the mac, which made it a bit gloppy and unappealing the first time around). Overall quite good, but not a \"must go back asap\", for me.",

My fiancee and I had the pleasure of dining at your Ballantyne location on Sunday. Our server was Briana D. She was on point.   Above average knowledge of the menu. She knew how to suggest, describe and up-sell with class and tons of personality. She accommodated our request to sample a few draft beers before making our selection. She turned us on to all of the specials available to us for that day and talked us into the cornbread with butter, honey and jalapenos!!!  Delicious. She knew the perfect way to order my brisket so that it would be lean, but still have the flavor I was looking for. She checked on us often and treated us like the only table in the place. The overall ambiance is casual and classy with a modern touch. We spoke to the manager for that evening, Dave, who was professional and proud of his team.  KEEP UP YOUR AMAZING PERFORMANCE!!!",

We waited about 30 minutes but found out you can do on waitlist on Yelp. This is a must as we here they are always very busy, and for good reason. We had the Pigout and it was more than enough for four people. The ribs were so good and meat fell off the bones. Please get the burnt ends at an add\"l $5 as they are well worth it. The sausage infused with a bit of cheese were so yummy. The brisket was buttery and flavorful. I can't say enough about the pulled chicken as it was some of the best I ever had. Soft, moist and delicious. Have whatever sides and you can't lose - crinkle cut fries, collards, mac n cheese, hush puppies were so good. To finish it off and we definitely did bot need it - pecan pie and chocolate cake ala mode were an amazing way to close out the night. You must stop by here. Enjoy!",

After reading a few Yelp reviews I ended up at this place and I was not disappointed. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with great customer service and a lovely atmosphere.   We opted for the Well-Fed combo platter between two of us and it was more than enough food. We got the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, sausage and sides of mac and collared greens. The brisket may have been the best I've ever had - literally unreal taste, melt in your mouth goodness. The ribs weren't far behind, as they were also delicious, smoky, with a dry rub and tasty without being greasy at all. The sausage and pulled pork however, were nothing to write home about. The mac and collared were top notch, but not the best I've ever had - the greens could have used more spice and the mac could have used a second cheese melted on top.   We also ordered two orders of texas toast, which came by the two slices, in huge portions for a dollar. Even though it was a ton of bread, with an already large meal, I'm not ashamed to say I ate it all - it was delicious and the kind of bread that does not make you regret the calories. We ended the meal with some sweet tea and key lime pie - which was good and served in an adorable way.   If you're looking for great BBQ in Charlotte look no further. I'd go back in a heartbeat, but this time just get the brisket and ribs.",

But honestly you cant go wrong and the wait staff is awesome!! Definitely  give it a try but try to go around 4:00pm so that you can get the ribs",

Lean, flavor packed, not too salty or spicy, all around perfect! The best stomach-full up meal is that with mac & cheese, which is almost as delicious. Good hush puppies too, they give you just enough so you don't get full on them. Their sauces are pretty spicy, but I personally did not need them for my food. The restaurant is big and gets crowded and there can be a wait. But they're never long. And the food is worth it!",

What a disappointment - bbq was cold and way too salty (and that's before I added any sauces to cut the salt taste).  Castllebury in a can would probably be better than what I was served on my visit.   If it wasn't for the rave reviews from others on yelp, I would not have made an effort to go here.  Bottom line -  mediocre food and there are better BBQ places in the Charlotte area I would recommend over this.  On an uptick, my wife ordered a burger which she said was ok (nothing special/unique) and I wasn't charged for the bbq plate.  Server was good too bad that food was subpar in my opinion.",

Leaving Independence Blvd. we ventured down Central Ave. surveiling the various restaurants situated along this immensely busy hipster enclave. \"No, I don't want pizza,\" No, I don't want fish tacos,\" No I don't want a burger or ramen,!!!  My son spotted Midwood Smokehouse and took an immediate right. Oh my gosh, never knew I was missing this!!! Have seen Midwood profiled on various local morning shows and I'm a sparerib officianato!!!  I ordered the burnt ends w/Mac & cheese. Son ordered the BBQ plate w/creamed corn. We shared a large chopped salad(delicious) as appetizer. Oh, I also had crinkle cut fries, my fav, as 2nd side. I love into those hot, crispy fries 1st thing. OMG, even the ketchup was good!!! Needless to say, most of our food was bagged up to take home. The burnt ends, phenomenal!!! The BBQ chopped pork, delicious!!! U rarely find a restaurant where everything on ur plate is outstanding. Midwood Smokehouse has managed to accomplish this. Cheers!!!!",

    "text": "Second visit and it was every bit as good as the first.  Went with my wife and our neighbor and had another meal of excellent barbecue, cold drinks and on point service.  This time I opted for a combo platter which I believe was a new option on the menu.  Four meats and two sides served in either a \"Well Fed\" or \"Pig Out\" portion.  Trust me, the well fed version is PLENTY!  Got pulled pork, St. Louis style ribs and double beef brisket since they were out of the smoked sausage.  It was all wonderful.  Smokey, moist with nice bark on the pork and the brisket.  The ribs were fall off the bone and just delicious.  It really is a lot of food.  Ended up taking some of all of it home so, I can't imagine what the pig out portion is like.  My wife and friend split the large pulled chicken plate and again, way more than they could eat.  The chicken is moist and served mixed up with the Smokehouse's slightly sweet mustard sauce.  For sides we shared fries, coleslaw and creamed corn and they were all delish as well.  I had a couple $1.50 PBR drafts and the girls had margaritas which they dubbed, \"best I've had in a long while\".  It will be doubtful I will get my wife to any other barbecue place after this experience as she dubbed it, best barbecue she's had since we moved to Charlotte in 2002.",

It's hard to get the right balance of smokiness in bbq, too little and it tastes bland, too much and it's overpowering. It's mouthwatering when it's done right, and they certainly have the skills at Midwood. I expected the pulled pork to be great, but their tacos were a pleasant surprise. Why eat brisket, slaw, and mac n cheese separately when you can have a perfect fusion of flavor all in the same bite!  Their creamed corn is great too, they add just enough salt and pepper to keep it from being pedestrian. The bacon wrapped jalapenos are fine too, but I wish they served more of them.   I can only speak for myself, but every time I've ate at Midwood I went home happy with a full belly. Sometimes the wait for a table can be a little long on a busy night, and their service can be a little sluggish because of it. But they're always friendly, and the food is always great. And isn't that all that really matters?",

What's cool about this place is the outside area where you can play corn hole while you wait for your table.  Establishment was full of hungry patrons so I was starting to think that maybe this BBQ was going to be different.  Staff is friendly, bartender was really nice and I even saw a coworker.  Location is perfect and I was ready to nibble on my Hubs' food (since I don't do BBQ I didn't order anything)   Hubs ordered I think the brisket sandwich.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FO.M.Google&s=da35bee72e2ea0fba3645523f61095801920386773e6d0903f95287589752fe9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.M.Google</a>.  Salty.  Greasy and what's with the blue cheese???  Fries were good though. Hubs had to scrape off the blue cheese as he hated it too.  The bread also looked like Texas Toast.  Just not a fan....so sorry.    Upside were the beer specials and also the banana pudding.  THAT was good.  yum.",

    "text": "Here's the big question.  Midwood or Sauceman's?  Oh that could prompt an endless debate.  So here's my take:  Midwood is the more pretentious, hipster-esque BBQ joint.  This is where I'd bring a friend who I'd like to impress with a cool BBQ spot and share a few local beers.  Whereas Sauceman's feels more casual and relaxed.  Almost like eating at a pit stop.  This is where I'd bring a friend who just likes eating BBQ.   Midwood is BBQ on a creative slant.  Burgers and tacos ... that's beyond the simplified offerings from the pit.  Bacon-wrapped jalapeno is delicious but ... that's just fixin's dolled up.  But don't get me wrong.  I can gnosh on these bacon jalapeno's all day.  Whereas Sauceman's is BBQ plain and simple.  The red slaw is a perfect digestive to the heaping amount of pulled pork you'd be served.  The hush puppies balances out the BBQ tray by offering you something mealy savor.    In a pure side-to-side comparison of solely the pulled pork (ignoring every other meat and side), I'd give the edge to Sauceman's.  Even when absolutely stuffed, I just couldn't put down the fork.  I just kept eating and eating.  Again, the red slaw helps tremendously.  But Midwood is legitimately good on its own right.  Briskets were above average.  Ribs about average.  Sides were above average.  Come on .... 508 reviews can't be wrong.  It's the most popular place in all of Charlotte.  Of course you'll come and you'll love it too.  If you took everything in consideration, Midwood and Sauceman's ends up being a tie in my book.  BBQ Hop 2015 #2 [March 2015]",

None of that smother your meat in sugary BBQ sauce nonsense; all tender, juicy meat, and you add your sauce. You could not go wrong coming here, good atmosphere, good food, good company.

I had the chicken sandwich with mustard sauce which was great, and a side of mac & cheese, also great!  I tried a bite of my friends pork sandwich with the vinegar sauce and loved it.  I also asked for a side of the Midwood sauce to try and dip the crinkle cut french fries in and was very impressed!  The coleslaw was chopped up very fine and very flavorful.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  The prices are very reasonable.  A couple of downsides, unfortunately they didn't have any ribs yet available for us to try.  All the more reason to go back on a Monday and enjoy those $2.50 beers!  Also the hostess seemed very flustered and told us our table would take at least 15-20 minutes when in fact we waited for less than 5.  Luckily we didn't believe her first assessment since there was no one else waiting or we might have left....  Would be disappointing to lose customers because of this!",

    "text": "When I pulled up outside, the scent wafting through the air convinced me that nothing that smells THAT good can possibly be that boy.  And I wasn't wrong!  Overall, this I'd rate this a strong 4.5.  This place is uber-fantastic!  The first night, I ordered the beef brisket and my partner ordered the pulled pork.  Each came with a different barbecue sauce.  The brisket was so tender that I barely needed the butter knife that accompanied my fork.  Both the pork and beef had a great smoky flavor that was good even without the sauce (although it was better with just a little bit of sauce on it).  I had the macaroni and cheese, which was DIVINE!  It also had a hint of smoky cheddar flavor.  I also had the privilege of eating the brown sugar bacon.  OMG, it blew my mind!  My partner remarked that it was like \"eating a pecan pie from a cooked pork belly.\"  It was a perfect combination of sweet and salty bacon-y goodness.  For dessert, we tried the pecan cobbler, which was so, so good - like eating a warm pecan pie.  My second trip I went at lunch and had the barbecue chicken and the bacon-wrapped jalapeno bites.  They were very good and not terribly spicy, but a little more cheese stuffed inside would have been perfect.  The chicken came with a mustard sauce, which I didn't try (not a mustard fan), but I was able to get a different sauce with it on the side.  Chicken was tender and flavorful, and less smoky-tasting than their other barbecued meats.  For dessert we had the cream cheese brownie, which was large and tasty, but very light on the cream cheese.    I have to agree with others that the picked onions and hush puppies were just ok (although I'm admittedly not a fan of raw onions).  Tables are a little close together in there, but they do have some outdoor seating available.  Service was good both times, even when they started to get pretty busy.  Prices are pretty reasonable - about $10 to $15 average per dinner.  Portion sizes are quite large; I had plenty to eat, but still had a lot of leftovers.  They offer some less-unhealthy options, such as a couple of different salads, steam veggies, and smoked veggies.  You can also get three side items for $7, in case you want to go that route.  This is my new go-to barbecue place.  I want to try nearly everything on their menu.  If you're coming here, come hungry!",

Before we even opened up our menus, our waitress told usbtheyvwere out of ribs.  For me, no big deal, I don't like them.  But a BBQ place with no ribs,  at 7pm on a weekend evening?  I ordered the brisket dinner.  It came with hush puppies and I got mac and cheese and the bacon wrapped jalapenos.   The food was amazing.  My brother who was disappointed there were no ribs, got tacos.  One of each type, brisket, pork and chicken I think, and he loved them all. Also ordered was the BBQ Burnt Ends and the Pulled Pork sandwich both of which were enjoyed.  Food was served quickly, but we never felt rushed.

We sort of split tow plates: the Burnt Ends and the Pulled Pork.  With that had four sides: Fries (meh), coleslaw (just OK), baked beans (yum), and creamed corn (rich version).  I enjoyed the pork more than the ends - pork was moist, perfectly pulled and sauced (with more available on the side) and nicely smoked.  The burnt ends were hit and miss - some nice and moist, others pretty dry.  Nice beer list of local and non-local craft brews, great music and vibe with adequate service.  I'd definitely go back if ever back in town.  We were debating between this and Mac's Speed Shop (describe to us later by locals as having a \"Hooter\" feel...they affirmed we went to the right spot!)",

Hubby is a True carnivore and was thrilled with the 4 meat combo plate, but...the service was not great and the sides left something to be desired. We started with the smoked wings as an appetizer. They were tasty but REALLY small. Hubby's 4 meat combo had ribs, pulled pork, sausage and brisket. His sides were fries and bacon wrapped jalapenos and he added an order of burnt ends. He loved all of the meats and the portion sizes are good. He's a big guy and almost went for the \"pig out\" portion, but opted for the \"well fed\" instead because of the appetizer and additional burnt ends, and wasn't able to finish all of it. He didn't even get to the sides, but he couldn't have cared less...it's all about the meat. I ordered the half chicken (all white meat) and for my sides, mac and cheese and collard greens. My chicken was good, but even though I asked, and the server repeated it to me, I did not get all white meat. I am a sides kinda girl, so I was disappointed in my mac and cheese and greens. I make them better at home. We also asked for an order of Texas toast when we ordered, which did not come out with the food. When we asked about it, they brought it, but it was unusual as it was sourdough bread and it wasn't buttered well. On top of not getting my chicken right and not getting the toast that we ordered with our food, my drink was empty when the server came to the table and she didn't notice. I had to ask for a refill. I will say she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu, but not very attentive to the details.",

    "text": "The BBQ ( and all of their other food) is so good here!  I got St. Louis Style Pork Ribs with Hushpuppies, Mac & Cheese & Baked Beans. The ribs were full of flavor, and so moist, that they practically fell off the bone. The sauce I got was the Midwood Signature and they've got it goin' on. The hushpuppies were so good. They were perfectly fried and were little bites of yumminess. The mac & cheese and baked beans were good as well. We also got some Banana Pudding for dessert and it was really good. It was fresh, creamy, and full of banana-y flavor.  The service was good. Our waitress was very helpful and checked on us pretty often, even though we were sitting outside.  This place gets packed as the night goes on, and parking is bad since the lot is small. So yeah, if you don't want to wait long, or deal with parking, make sure to come here earlier.",

Midwood chopped salad is to die for and the dressings are pretty amazing. Honestly, with the exception of the smoked chicken, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. CONS: I have been shortchanged on portions so many times, it's become laughable. I went to buy(and paid for) 2 pounds of pork bbq to take to a friend in New Mexico but when I got home to portion it out in zip lock bags, it was 19 ounces. Had the same thing happen twice when I got a lage brisket plate to go. Supposed to be 10 ounces but both times it was 6 ounces. Called to complain and the manager was supposed to send me something in the mail but never took care of it or followed up. Bottom line, an awesome place to eat in but beware of take out. You pay for more than you are supposed to get.",

He really described each dish along with drink choices. He was awesome.   My group settled on the brisket, BBQ pork sandwich, and the chicken. We also had the bacon wrapped jalapenos. Along with sides of fries and hush puppies.   The meat was tender! The brisket was to die for. It was seriously so good. Especially when paired with their BBQ sauce. The pork was also nice and tender and packed full of great flavors. Loved the jalapenos, they weren't too spicy due to the bacon. Even the fries were cooked perfect. The boyfriend loves the hushpuppies (I'm not a fan of them in generally but he said they were great).   Nothing was left. Seriously. Every crumb was eaten.   Throughly enjoyed will be back.",

First we were told it was going to be a 25 minute wait which turned into almost an hour. When we sat down we Ordered the queso and brisket dip. After about 30 mins the dip was brought out and it was cold. We waited 30 mins for cold queso? And it Tasted like can cheese.... I told the server about the cold dip and he was very nonchalant and did not offer much of an apology. The food came out one hour after we sat down and the only thing that was hot were the sides. The bbq which they specialize in was not even luke warm. I sent the plate back after informing the manager and she brought back the same plate that she went and microwaved for 30 seconds. There were 8 of us and we were very disappointed with the food... We will never come back to this restaurant... My husband's burger was pretty good but that was the only plus",

    "text": "We were driving down Central Ave last night, looking for someplace to eat.  We figured we'd go to one of the places we've already been, when we spotted the Midwood Smokehouse.   It looked nice on the outside and there seemed to be people milling about, so we figured it must be good.    There was a 20-minute wait, so we sidled up to the bar for a drink.  During our stint at the bar, some stools opened up, so we sat down and were invited to dine there as well by the bartender.  Rather than wait longer and, since the restaurant was pretty much a bar atmosphere overall, we decided to go ahead and stay put.  I didn't really want an appetizer, but the bacon-wrapped jalapenos sounded delish!  That's when I noticed that they're available as a side item.  Woo hoo -- SOLD!    I ordered the small-sized version of the Carolina Pork plate (with vinegar-y BBQ sauce) and the jalapenos as my side.  Out came this big pile of shredded pork.  The sauce was served in a small ramekin on the side, which really isn't enough.  Be sure to request 2 or 3!   On the side were my jalapenos wrapped in bacon.  SO yummy!  And, actually, not very spicy.  The hush puppies that also came with the plate were delicious, too.    I really liked Midwood Smokehouse (possibly even more than -- dare I say it?)  Mac's Speed Shop.  They have great food, great prices (on food and drink), and a great atmosphere -- both indoors and out!  The bartender (sorry--I'm not good with names!) was super friendly and efficient, too.",

My husband and kids started with the bacon wrapped jalepano peppers and they were gone pretty quickly so I am guessing they were pretty good.  We got a combo platter to split at our table so we could try a little of everything.  The brisket was awesome and the pork was pretty decent too.  The pulled chicken tasted a little dry and I didn't really love the ribs...but am not generally a fan of Saint Louis style ribs.  The sides we got (fries and creamed corn) were good too.  We shared a peach cobbler to end the meal with which was okay.  Service was great.

    "text": "I've been hearing a lot about this joint and managed to make it out for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  I arrived just a little after noon and was able to park in the lot directly in front of the restaurant.  While there were a bunch of open tables outside, there was only two tables open inside.  I was able to snag an inside table (it's much easier reading a newspaper at a table as opposed to the bar) and began perusing the menu.  Jennifer came out to take my drink order and when she returned, I peppered her with questions about the menu.  Among other things, I discovered that there is more meat on the small plate, than there is on the sandwich.  I decided to go with the small plate with mac and cheese and the creamed corn as the sides.   Food was out in less than ten minutes.  The pork was wonderfully smokey and came with a small side of sauce (eastern-style).  On appearance, the hushpuppies looked more like tater tots.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but.....it gave the impression that they were pre-fab.  They were almost too perfect.  And I have to admit that I wasn't a big fan of the mac and cheese.  It was not creamy enough for my liking.  With all that said, the creamed corn was outta sight!  There was a strong black pepper taste which I loved.  Service was fantastic.  When Jennifer found out that I didn't like the mac and cheese, she offered something else.  She was apologetic and returned within a minute with a side of the red slaw (which was terrific, by the way).  She was quick to refill my beverage and was very helpful answering my questions.  As has been mentioned earler, the cost is a little on the high side, but it was a lot of food, and I think it's worth it.  I will definitely be back for more!",

I got the small smoked turkey plate with mac & cheese & sweetie got the chicken with south carolina style mustard sauce.  He got the creamed corn.  The sides were really good & we enjoyed them.  Maybe we picked the wrong things (?!), but for a place that smokes their own meats I'm sad to say we were disappointed.  The smoked turkey looked beautiful, but it was dry & mostly tasteless.  Not very smoky at all!  I doused it with barbecue sauce, but it didn't help much.  Sweetie's chicken was o.k., but that mustard sauce was weird... not a True SC sauce at all!  It tasted like it had cumin in it & we both agreed that if you put it over rice with some naan bread on the side, you'd be eating Indian.  It has a fun atmosphere.  Drew was our server & he was super friendly and helpful with the menu & explained the restaurant and set up since it was our first time there and always kept our drinks filled.  There is an upstairs area with a great view of uptown, but for some odd legal reason they can't serve up there.  People will just get a to-go order & go upstairs & seat themselves.  We might try it again & check out the brisket or pork. Maybe.",

The problem with Charlotte BBQ is that most places are some weird hodgepodge of different BBQ styles that ends in some strange mess that does not even resemble real BBQ. Midwood Smokehouse certainly does a good job at executing BBQ with its own twist and fair prices to boot. I highly recommend.  EDIT: I highly recommend either coming early or getting takeout.

The burnt ends were tender on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside, covered in a BBQ sauce with a kick. I ordered the small portion and it was more than enough. The hush puppies were light and airy. The mac and cheese was the only thing that didn't really stand out. The pecan cobbler was a home run. Do not attempt to eat it on your own. I did, and I failed miserably. It is sweet, warm with a maple syrupy type sauce that leaves you yearning for fall to get here already! The vanilla ice cream on top is an absolute must!",

    "text": "I sat at the bar, and I received great service from the male bartender. He was courteous and professional. I also noticed that he checked to go orders for accuracy, prior to handing the food over to the customers. That is a commitment to excellent service.  Prices: Expensive. Figure on $25 per person without beer or cocktails. Yeah, I know that this is Charlotte, but I don't want to pay their rent.   Pulled Pork Barbecue Quality? Good, but slightly over-rated. Maybe the best in CLT though. I liked their burnt ends the best. B+  Decor: This is a cool restaurant, well laid out and inviting. I like the vibe and decor of this place.   Negatives: Parking in their minuscule parking lot is almost nonexistent. I guess that one could park across the road in the shopping center parking lot and dart across the busy traffic, but I'm too old to play \"dodge ball with vehicles.\"  PS: A confused waitress brought out my bacon wrapped jalapeno appetizer - well AFTER I received my entree, and she tried to give it to other customers....not good. Many of the seeds were left in the jalapenos, so they were hella spicy, almost too spicy to eat. I left one on the plate.   I classify Midwood Smokehouse's fare as \"city\" barbecue or barbecue for those who don't know any better. Hey Midwood, don't despair, B+ from me on BBQ is pretty darned good. See my BBQ list for traditional BBQ restaurants in NC at 1/3 the price.",

Would have definitely preferred it to have been sliced. Second was the blue cheese really overwhelmed the beef. The Mac n cheese wasn't bad, some bites were a little salty for some reason, but it didn't seem dried out and old or mushy like a lot of BBQ places do. It wasn't terrible, and service was good. I'd go back to try an actual BBQ plater when I have more time.",

Small and SOFFTTTTTT  5 stars for their hours. 11pm makes for some decent times to eat brisket.  2 stars for those bacon wrapped jalapenos. I would not recommend.  4 stars for the greens. YES!!!! I'd recommend. Flavored right but wish they added Mustard or Turnips to them. And offer more.  3.9 stars for the hush puppies with every meal. Good crisp but I'm not certain it's always fresh.   5 stars for our burger. The kid highly recommends.  0 stars for the price upgrades on Double ribs, Bone-in Chicken, et al on the $26 Well Fed Platter.  2 stars for not having more BBQ sauces to try. I guess Famous Dave's spoils me.  Mac & Cheese = ok. NO hand cut fries.  Texas Toast is extra.  Daily specials worth returning for! They sell out fast.   Oh! 1st visit was Thursday, 9/28/17 & they were sold out of ribs @ 9pm, EST.  I wasn't bothered but made me return. I left with Brisket to go and got the mixture of lean and fatty + jalapenos and I can say... I understand why everyone talks about the brisket here.   :* :*   Next time, I'll shoot for chicken (bone-in) and smoked wings and some more brisket.  Oh! Their sausage isn't bad. It's not beef but not bad.   P.P.S. That cheese dip with brisket - bleh. That cheese dip isn't even Sam's Club in the metal can. It's just tasteless and I would never recommend.   Why the 5 stars? P.P.P.S = Great service + BEST ICE away from Tijuana Flat + BRISKKKKEEETTTT. And the greens~  Muah. :* Parking is available.  Outdoor seating and it fills up quickly after church but decent space regardless of the hour.  I'm shocked there's not more locations.",

I will say that the cream corn recipe has changed recently and I don't like it as much as the old one. The old one had a really good pepper flavor and the new recipe is a little bland.   I went for a friend's birthday recently - we had a large group and some mild issues getting seated. The hostess seemed a little agitated when she took us outside to sit in the enclosed patio and we asked to be moved inside (I used to be a hostess and would have asked the party if they were okay with going outside before taking them out there and then turning around... but anyway).  Our server was really upbeat and attentive to our needs. He was great! I look forward to going back to Midwood.",

But you should probably order like 1 hour before you plan on eating because it sometimes does take an hour or longer. If you have patiebce though. The atmosphere is pretty cool generally. And if you have the time it'll be a decent night",

    "text": "Midwood Smokehouse is a restaurant I came to know from my foodie Boyfriend. My first experience to Midwood, I was a little skeptical especially because it specializes in NC BBQ, which as a NYer, I'm not really thrilled on BBQ. However, after going numerous times, this place is a hidden gem. The atmosphere is busy yet the staff is very attentive. The drinks are amazing and relatively cheap which is always good in my book. Let's get into the food!!! RIBS are BOMB! Burnt Ends? <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.com&s=ac71b33d32e90570e9c0d70edf9b4cac5f20e98e10501794c62801370f5dd3f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.com</a>, the Smoked 1/2 Chicken (Midwood Style) AMAZING. BBQ Queso (Beef Brisket) TASTY. Amongst the sides such as Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens (a little vinegary), Creamed Corn, Sweet Potato Fries and many more are compliments to the party in your mouth. If you are looking for a place to get away in Plaza Midwood, I would definitely suggest this place! You can sit upstairs, outside or even indoors. Order a beer, get some burnt ends, and enjoy your BBQ with any flavored sauce you want. You'll enjoy!",

So many exciting things going on on the pallet. The brisket was so tender you almost have to just pick it up with your fingers. So delicious.   Thanks to all the yelpers who recommended this place.

The staff was friendly and helpful, the food was wonderful and the atmosphere was great. A group of five of us was seated and served without issue. It was a little loud in the restaurant, but that is to be expected on a busy Sunday afternoon. The burnt ends were GLORIOUS! They provide four options for sauces, each one was more delicious than the last. I even got some packed up to take home! Both versions of their cole slaw were excellent. Overall I would definitely go back and would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!",

I asked the waitress and she tells me that the chopped barbecue is \"basically like pulled because it's big pieces\". I order it against my better judgement. Surprise! It's not like pulled pork! It's chopped into tiny little pork dust and dry (as I find most chopped pork to be). Not a fan. The macaroni and cheese was very salty. The collards were good. The ice in the drinks was the soft nugget style. We also tried the smoked wings and those were good. Doubt we'll be back.",

My boyfriend enjoyed his Cuban sandwich and of course the hush puppies. Our server was excellent, never letting our drinks go empty and constantly checking to make sure we didn't need anything.

However, their brisket taste like it was anointed by God. My wife prefers hers less fatty and I prefer mine fatty. You can get it either way or mixed. The brisket from Midwood is a revelation. Their Mac and cheese is delicious. It is baked and cheesy. The baked beans are great. The sweet and smoky flavor of the beans are a great side. Maybe my favorite baked beans. I also love their bacon wrapped jalapenos. My wife loves their chopped salad. She prefers it with the brisket, but you can have it with other proteins. My wife has had it with the Salmon as well.  We also love their pimento cheese fries with brisket added (of course). Their jalapeno, cheese sausage is a great addition. You can buy them by the link.  The ribs are also tasty and smoked right. I have also had their burger which is another good option. Staff has always been nice. There is ample seating inside, on the covered patio, at the bar and on the roof.

Every bite was warm and satisfying, perfect for a chilly, rainy day (or any day at all really!). For dessert we got the banana pudding and it was to die for.

I came to midwood via yelp recommendation for some good bbq in the area. It was easy enough to get a table for 2 at lunch time on a Sunday. The menu is pretty big.. it's a restaurant as well as a bbq joint.. so you can get salads and sandwiches too. My friend and I split the combo platter- chopped chicken, chopped pork, brisket, and pork ribs, Mac n cheese, and beans. I enjoyed about half the plate- the brisket, ribs, and Mac m cheese were good-- not better than Texas.. but still tasty enough.   The chicken and chopped pork were so forgettable. In fact it was hard to tell the difference between the 2 chopped meats. This is definitely a rib joint! They have a limited number of beef ribs too.. but at $29/each I am skeptical! They weren't even that much in Texas.   Plenty of seating.. indoors and outdoors. Very casual place. Service was good and there appeared to be daily drink specials.",

    "text": "Not impressed. For all the great reviews, Midwood Smokehouse turned out to be a disappointment. The weekend special beef ribs were largely overpowered by the over-seasoning and the mac and cheese was way too salty. If you're gonna develop hypertension, at least indulge your BBQ cravings elsewhere.  Born in Atlanta and raised most of my life in North Carolina, I've had lot of BBQ in my day and Carolina style BBQ is absolutely one of the best you can get. Some of my favorites have been in a few local shops in Raleigh and Asheville. Comparatively, the beef rib I had at Midwood was probably the least impressive in flavor. The seasoning was just too much which juxtaposed terribly with the meat since it seemed to have no penetration at all. Moreover, the mac and cheese was so salty I could barely finish it. For a $30+ meal (and a \"weekend special\"), it was NOT worth it.  Service was fine, no complaints there.",

The pork burned ends on the other hand..... I could eat a family size portion of it and would ask for more!!!! The fatty bits were perfectly balanced with the meaty soft bits. The sauce it was tossed in was sweet, salty and tangy. Amazing!!!   For sides - sweet potatoes fries, can't go wrong with anything fried and baked beans.",

The slaw is only OK, but to me, slaw is essential for barbecue. This is why I wish the small plates came with two sides. The sweet pickled onions are a nice touch. There is a reason it sometimes gets crowded.",

    "text": "Wow, guess we caught the new Midwood location at a bad time. I've seen and read many favorable reviews, sadly, our experience was such that I told the manager on duty their products were average, at best. We arrived at 9:30, probably not the best time, but if the lights are on and the doors are open, the food should be as good as Noon or 7:00 PM. It was not, not even close. When we opened the car door the smell of wood smoke was a wonderful welcome, that was the highlight. We went in and waited and when no staff came to seat us I went to the bar to ask if they were still serving. She said yes and seated us. It was obvious folks were working to close, it appeared the kitchen had closed down early too. We got four portions of meat -- chicken, pork, brisket and ribs. Without exception they were all overcooked. The ribs were not hot (barely warm) but they were tough and dry. If I had been blindfolded, except for the texture of the meats, I could not tell the difference in taste between the pork and chicken. The chicken was overly moist, as though it had been in a holding tray being warmed and water condensation had dripped on the meat making it too soft. The brisket had a nice smoke ring but like the pork seemed to have been cooked much earlier and dried out. As a result it was tough like the ribs. I have eaten and judged BBQ throughout the southeast, as I told the manager, this would not have made my top ten. In fact if I was judging, under the rules I would have had to write individual notes on each sample as the score would have been so low. Hopefully it was a bad day, the review have been good but on this night it was average, at best. I will go back, it has to be better...",

I had driven by this place countless times (usually on my way to the other great restaurants in the area) but I am glad I finally made a stop in to experience it.  I was super early to meet my friend, so I just hung out at the bar and took advantage of their drink specials.  The bartender(s) were super nice and quick and the bar did fill up rather quickly around dinner time.  Take out orders are also handled/processed at the bar so they got super super busy.  It was nice to see that the bar can multi-task without losing any composure.  When my friend did finally arrive, we ended up sitting at a bar instead of getting a table so I didn't have to close out or anything, but it seems like a lot of people have a drink at the bar and then go have their meal in the dinning room when their party arrives.  We ended up getting a smattering of BBQ... the \"Pig Out\" plate that included:  Pulled Pork, BBQ Chicken, Ribs, and their brisket (Oh! and two sides) - went with the mac and cheese and bacon wrapped jalapenos.  The brisket was melt-in-your-mouth and the bbq was super tasty and everything I had dreamed it should be.  This is my new go-to BBQ place based on my first visit.  Judging my the constant stream of patrons coming through the doors... looks like I may have joined everyone else as well (just a bit late).",

I tried the pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and chopped chicken.  All were really good, my favorite was probably the pulled pork.  The brisket isn't quite as good as Sauceman's but it definitely holds its own.  As for the sides, we had macaroni, collards, and hush puppies.  All were great as well.

Our waitress checked up on us periodically, but as soon as most of the food was delivered, she disappeared.  One person in our party did not get his food and it was 20 minutes before we could flag someone down (and that was not even our waitress; it was still another 10 minutes before we saw her).  You have a party of 8 and mandatory tipping is illegal now so you should be checking up on the table every few minutes, especially after the food is delivered.  The manager comped my friend's meal which was nice, but it was a bad experience overall.  The bacon-wrapped jalapenos and the brisket were just okay.  I am not in much of a hurry to return especially considering the hassle of getting in and out of the place.  They also need some blinds or tinted plastic on the patio.",

The all star is the brisket and ribs! Make sure to order the mixed version of brisket a little fat and some lean to balance the flavor. YUM! Ribs are fall off the bone good! I also had the pulled chicken and pulled pork both tasty and tender! Also along with the pick 4 are the sides you get to pick 2. Skip on the hush puppies as a side because you get some with this combo. I choose mac and cheese and the bacon jalapenos. Mac was thick and tasty and jalapenos....awesome. Bacon wrapped around a hot pepper! Genius! So dam good!  Also they give you three choices of sauce to join your meal. Try them all! There all good.  Killer food guys, killer. Friendly staff cool bbq joint, can't say enough good things about the place!",

I'm a huge mac and cheese lover so it doesn't necessarily say anything about the entree that I ordered but I was never really motivated to go back.  Well this past weekend we were in the area so we stopped by. My boyfriend pointed out the brisket sandwich and I knew that is what I had to get. Tender brisket on Texas toast with red onions and the best part  . . . blue cheese. It not only lived up to expectations it exceeded it. The flavor was great. And yes, I did get the mac and cheese again and it was as great as I remembered it.  Another must try is the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos.  They are great.  Wish they had been a little spicier but that can be hard to gage when it comes to jalapenos.  I am already ready to head back to have that sandwich again.",

You could get them dry as well but I prefer mine wet.  Everything else on the sampler platter was ok.  The pork was decent but not one of my favorites around town and the chicken was a little dry.  The mac n cheese is one of the better ones around town.  They have local beer specials on Mondays and other specials the rest of the week.  Service wise, they are decent although nothing really stands out with the service.",

    "text": "Succulent Southern goodness!!  I came here with some friends on Saturday. After scouring Yelp, driving around town, and ruling out some places that have been featured on various TV shows (but had terrible ratings), we agreed on this place.   We decided to sample a little of everything: The fried pickles were pretty good, if you're into that sort of thing. (I heard that they're a Southern thing, so I decided to give them a try.) The pimento cheese fries were cheesy and yummy and otherwise delicious! The hushpuppies... well, I could eat those by the pound. Fried just right, not at all greasy. Just a little bit sweet and perfect one-bite sized. Careful though; you can eat a whole order without realizing it (and then you would have no room for BBQ, and nobody wants that!)  I got the brisket \"burnt ends\" for my entree. To be 'ends', they were surprisingly tender with just the right amount of sweet, smoky sauce. The mac and cheese was the real deal, with the slightly charred cheese on top... just like mama used to make (none of that Easy Mac crap that some of these places try to give you)! The creamed corn was not too sweet, a little peppery... not what I expected, but not bad. My friends got a half slab of ribs and smoked salmon respectively and the only complaint at the table was that there was more food on the table than belly to put it all in.  Stuffed though we were, we HAD to make room for dessert. Our server (Drew?) talked us into some of their homemade banana pudding. After interrogating him thoroughly about the legitimacy of the pudding (Is it banana \"flavored\" instant pudding? Are there real Nilla wafers in it? Are there any actual bananas in the pudding?), we were informed that it is made fresh by a baker that the restaurant 'stole' from a local bakery nearby.  (And in case you're wondering...No, it's not instant pudding. Yes, there are lots of Nilla wafers inside [and no, they are not soggy! That's a pet peeve of mine], as well as fresh, not browned, bananas).  The pudding was a bit too sweet for my taste (to be fair, I'm VERY picky 'bout my pudding!), but my friends gobbled it right on up.  The cocktails were ok. My friend got a drink with smoked ice (yes, smoked ice) in it that she thoroughly enjoyed. I got something with Jim Beam Devil's Cut, but to be fair, the drinks were in waaaay over their head competing with all the succulent flavors coming from the numerous plates surrounding them. All in all, we had a blast! The service was as good as the food and if I'm ever in Charlotte again, I'll be back!",

I'm sad to say, I gotta give it 3*s 'cos it's a crazy mixed bag. Some things are incredible (this is some of the best pulled pork and mustard sauce I've had in the Queen City, and no mistake about that; the bacon-wrapped jalapenos are delicious; and the collards are downright tasty), but other things kinda... Suck, frankly (as noted by others, the service, for one - why did I have to ask MULTIPLE TIMES to have my water replenished, for example? I don't know - they weren't that crowded). And some of the menu items kinda just didn't get it done for me - the ribs, for example, were well-prepared, but I couldn't taste the ribs for the flavour of the wood in which they were smoked; the mac 'n cheese is merely middlin', and Mac's brisket is far superior. And since when does a server not offer dessert, anyhow?   So, it gets a solid three: what it gets right, it gets CRAZY right. What it gets wrong, though, really puts a damper on things.",

HORRIBLE MISTAKE. The BBQ queso was not good at all. Looked and tasted like microwaveable dip from a jar. The tortilla chips were somehow stale, oily and unsalted all at the same time. I got the grilled cheese with pork which subsequently turned into a BBQ sandwich with half a piece of cheese. If you're going to call it a grilled cheese - it should be ooey gooey - just saying. Also did not taste or see the grilled onions and creamy tomato sauce it was supposed to come with. My boyfriend got the brisket plate. It was dry, tough, and completely overcooked. That's the first time I've ever seen him leave brisket on a plate. Service was bottom five I've ever had. We live right around the corner, but would much rather drive to Mac's than come here ever again. Mac's has bigger portions, better food and wayyyy better service for the same price.",

They weren't even busy, I watched a few tables get sat after us and the servers didn't waste any time going to greet them and taking their drink order. One server walked by us twice and looked at us without saying a word and she wasn't busy bc she was standing around talking to other servers who were waiting for tables. I'm sure if we weren't black they would have greeted us with a smile, but we decided to get up and leave and spend our money elsewhere.

Finally had the pleasure of giving it a try the other night and dined on some absolutely delicious beef brisket.  Brisket is a pretty tricky thing because it can dry easily and become very chewy, etc.  This on the other hand was falling apart it was so juicy and tender.  Prior to stuffing my face with the brisket I enjoyed some jalapeno peppers wrapped in bacon...good lord!  The temperature will sneak up on you so be careful but the taste is oh so good.  Great beer selections and a cozy neighborhood restaurant feel really seal the deal for me.  I'll be back.....OFTEN :)",

Oddly enough their pulled pork is my least favorite thing here. But literally everything else I've had on the menu is out of this world. Bacon wrapped jalapenos... umm YES. Brisket is phenomenal, BBQ chicken isn't run of the mill chicken at all, extremely flavorful and different. Just thinking about the smell of this place makes me hungry.  Tip: if you get the BBQ chicken instead of the mustard based BBQ sauce ask to get a few different ones on the side so you can taste them all.",

However I had heard this place was beyond amazing and when I left I really had no desire to ever go back. Well maybe I'll give it another try if only for the banana pudding which was REALLY good (almost like grandma made it but only almost lol).  The jalapeno poppers were not good. They had a weird texture, were soggy, and the bacon was not even close to being crispy. I was very disappointed!  The pulled pork was okay but I've had oh so much better in my life (anyone who has had Lexington BBQ can attest to that).  The macaroni and cheese reminded me of something you'd get in a cafeteria. Again I just wasn't impressed!!  Our waitress was nice but clueless. She just never seemed to have her act together, couldn't remember our orders (yes she wrote them down??) and asked us if we wanted to order desert before our dinner was even brought out. I'm sensing that some other reviewers may have had this same waitress lol.  All in all I have numerous friends who keep raving about this place so I'm going to try it one more time to see if maybe I just got them on a seriously off day. If it's still not good then I may need to question my friends taste levels haha  Oh one more thing, the beer selection was good in my opinion!!",

Another friend of mine had the smoked sausage and raved about it. The big surprise for me was the appetizer of smoked chicken wings! Meaty and delightful - not fried or swimming in sauce.

I've lived in NC my whole life and while this isn't your mom and pop BBQ joints I am so fond of from my childhood, Midwood is a perfect blend of authenticity and creativity. The \"secret\" is that the folks here really care. They sincerely want you to have a great time, serve you some amazing food, and have you leave with a smile.   On my most recent trip, my girlfriend took me to Midwood for my birthday. Although there was a line, they quickly seated us and we were greeted by our waiter Jimmy who was attentive and friendly. I always get the BBQ sampler with double dry ribs, smoked sausage, and fatty brisket. I had been hesitant to try the bacon wrapped jalapenos because I saw some complaints on Yelp. But on Jimmy's recommendation, we got an order and they were to die for! Really, really delicious.   Their meats are perfectly smoked, full of flavor, consistently moist, and always memorable. If you're looking for a great, fun, foodie place - look no further than Midwood Smokehouse!  P.S. Their hushpuppies are the best I've ever had!",

I was initially very hesitant to eat here as the only thing I can get is the salmon with a side of veggies and that can get boring. I was wrong. We eat here all the time, I'd probably eat their salmon every night if I could. It's alarmingly good. I mean possibly the best salmon I've ever had good. And according to my husband every other thing on the menu is also amazing.  The service is consistently great. Once we had an obviously new and overwhelmed server on a busy night, she kept forgetting things and we felt bad for her, and instead of getting angry the manager and other servers just pitched in and were extra friendly. It's always great to see supportive coworkers and customers who are so thrilled with their food that they don't get all rude and complain-y about some occasional mishaps. 10/10 would recommend.",

Ordered tacos - brisket tacos might as well have bee called beef jerky tacos because the meat was dry and there was a sliver of avocado so the bite I took stuck to the roof of my mouth. The Chicken taco was GREAT! The jalepeno in the middle was still very crunchy, but the taco overall was good!  Nachos - not good. The server said it was homemade queso - which apparently translates to melted shredded cheese.  The Chili was good. Good flavor and texture.

I got the sampler plate with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork and I would describe all 3 as dry and a bit tough.  Basically, this is Chili's or Wendy's or some other fast-food-type place level BBQ trying to masquerade as real BBQ.

    "text": "Midwood is my go to place in Charlotte for bbq. I've been to some of the other locations and this one was no different. I'm from Georgia where we do bbq slightly different than the Carolinas so I was happy to find a place that had great bbq here. We went on a busy Saturday night, but our wait was only around 10 minutes. This visit, I went with the brisket queso which was amazing. The brisket was tender and flavorful as always and the price is very reasonable. One big reason I also enjoy Midwood is their Mac n Cheese. Most places these days just give you noodles with some nasty cheese sauce on them, but Midwood actually provides baked mac n cheese the right way. There is also a large parking lot across the street which is nice so parking is a breeze. Midwood is always a good option.",

First and foremost the food here does not come out up to temperature, just like warm. The Mac and cheese was good but not warm. The collard greens were pretty bland to have been cooked in pork, not very smoke or seasoned. The jalapeno cheddar sausage was good.  The rest of the sampler was average if not a little dry.  There are better choices in Charlotte. Service was on point and decor was really cool. Overall just average. Dinner for two with one beer and a tip was 55.00 not worth what the price.",

We ended-up splitting a BBQ platter that included ribs, Cheerwine (soda) burnt ends, pulled pork and brisket; sides included mac-n-cheese, collard greens, hush puppies and coleslaw. I also ordered banana pudding to-go because I can't pass it up when eating BBQ. While I only had one, the beer selection was great and very local, which was exactly what I was looking for.   They also have tacos. I didn't order them, but it seems strange and worth mentioning.  The ribs were amazing. They were a little saltier than I've ever had and I still can't discern wither that helps or hurts them. Everything else was really good, but not great. The coleslaw and hush puppies were almost tasteless. There was a lot of mediocrity here, but I'm giving 4 stars based on the ribs, banana pudding and beer selection.",

The sauce killed all the Smokey goodness and made the dish very bland and undesirable. I came one more time and ordered them again, this time specifying no sauce, but they came with sauce anyway. Sucked donkey balls once again. If they stopped putting the sauce on the burnt pork ends it will for sure knock your genitals out the back of your pants. Otherwise....boooooooorinnng.

    "text": "BBQ time!  The great: sauces were very tasty, especially that vinegar sauce on the pork! Mac and cheese was bomb. A baked mac topped with cheddar combined with a cheese sauce to resist dryout: the way it's supposed to be. (If you're thinking \"obviously,\" I agree but somehow a lot of places still serve casserole mac sans cheese sauce and it just doesn't work.)   The good: pork was slightly too dry, relying completely on the vinegar sauce. I would have liked it to be more moist on its own, but with plenty of sauce, it still worked. The bacon wrapped jalapenos had wonderful flavor but the bacon was somewhat undercooked. These mugs should be crispy outside, not chewy.  The okay: the chicken! way too dry! No amount of mustard sauce could moisten it up. Here's a tip from a real actual one-time barbecuer at a restaurant that, (no dis, it's just the truth) made better BBQ than y'all: If you're hot-holding your meats with the lid off, you need to periodically add stock to keep the moisture up. If not, toss it on your flat top and give it a squirt of stock (or water if you're out of stock), cook it for literally 20 seconds. The boiling stock (or water) will heat it in no time and it will be nice and moist!  I did this with my leftovers and it allowed the smokiness of the chicken to take center stage. DO IT!!  The bad: nothing!  Good job guys! A well-deserved 4 out of 5!",

Sides I wasn't impressed with - Mac n cheese was just okay - noodles were undercooked and the cheese just wasn't great, and def needed salt (and pepper) if you like pepper.

I mean, it's no 12-Bones (outta Asheville), but you'll leave happy enough.  The ribs are quite good, as is the pulled pork and brisket (I like a mix of lean and fatty).  Sausage was only alright, and I'd steer clear of the KC burnt ends, normally one of my favorites, but which were too tough and bland for my liking (lacking that sharp bark-y zing). Sides are solid: mac and cheese, beans, Carolina slaw, and bacon-wrapped cheesy jalapenos for the m'fin WIN!  Also has pretty good beer list, especially if you like NC and Southeastern craft brews.",

    "text": "I really wanted to rate this place higher, but I just couldn't do it. The food was good, not great. The server was better than good, I had expected slow service after reading other reviews, but our waitress was on the ball with water refills and taking our order.   We started with an order of hush puppies, which my Wife and Daughter enjoyed. My meal came with them, so I waited for those. Alex ordered a brisket sandwich, which was served stacked on a bun. She selected mac & cheese as her side. She loved the mac & cheese, and said that the brisket was OK, but not as good as I make. I think she was sucking up for something from her Daddy. Alina ordered the BBQ Chicken sandwich. She really enjoyed her choice, and had the yummy mac & cheese as well. I splurged, and order a large burnt ends plate, with sides of cole slaw and bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers. Let's start with the sides. The cole slaw was chopped, and a tasty mixture of white and purple cabbage. It was a little dry for my taste, but it was still good. I loved the pepper poppers. They were the highlight of the meal. The bacon was cooked just right, not crispy and not undercooked to be chewy. The peppers had just the right amount of heat, and the cheese blended nicely with the 2 flavors. I loved them (in case you missed that the first time). Lastly, the burnt ends. I have prepared burnt ends a couple of times, and I think mine turned out better. My issue with these are that they seemed more like chinks of meat, rather than the actual ends of the brisket. They were tasty, but mostly from the sauce they were tossed in. I liked the smoky flavor in each bite, but the meat itself was nothing special.   So 3 stars? Mostly because of the price. Our bill was $42, with only 1 soft drink on the tab. For what we got, it was an expensive lunch, with no to go boxes.",

(I enjoy high levels of salt, so you should know that when I complain about something being to salty, it's reached a level of ridiculousness).  Anyway, I'm pleased to say that they seem to have toned down the saltiness somewhat.  I'm giving them an extra star.  I highly recommend the smoked half-chicken, the brisket, and the ribs.  The hush puppies are the best I've ever had, though I'm not a fan of the hush-puppy genre.  For sides I recommend baked beans and slaw (or bbq slaw).  I also enjoy the pickled onions that come with every meal.  The bacon-wrapped jalapenos are pretty boring, sadly.   They are just globs of fat without much flavor.  Staff is super friendly and owner is very nice.",

We came over the lunch hour so there was a small wait to eat inside but they could've seated us outside right away.   Per other Yelp reviews, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the Mac'n'cheese. They were insanely good. The Mac was super cheesy!! And that's how I like it. We also ordered an appetizer of the hush puppies. They were perfect.   My mom is a big fan of pecan pie and HAD to try the pecan cobbler, with vanilla ice cream of course. She said she'd give Midwood a 10 based on the cobbler alone.   A+ to the wait staff as well. Very friendly and always checking in. It's a shame we're not from around here to visit more often!!",

My boyfriend and I shared the \"Pig Out\" combo. Ribs were delicious with the sauce on the side for an occasional dunk. Brisket was tender and flavorful. The smoked sausage with pickled onions and the mustard they brought with it was a nice combo. I even enjoyed their Carolina Pork. The sauce had a nice balance to it that I didn't experience when I lived in the state 10 years ago. Collard greens and Mac&Cheese were both winners. Don't pass up the chocolate chip bread pudding a la mode. Even the tea was nice, not over brewed and bitter like some places. Although we specifically went for the rooftop seating on a perfect night and it wasn't open and the downstairs patio was full our table inside was pleasant and the service was attentive. We'll definitely be back!",

We went on a Friday night and it was not too crowded. We sat at the bar area because we did not want to wait for a table and the aroma was making me hungry!  We ordered the fried pickles and the smoked wings for an appetizer. The fried pickles were good. Not the best in Charlotte, but good. The smoked wings however were great and had some flavor to them. We got a combo platter to share because we wanted to try everything. We got the smoked turkey, pork ribs, pulled pork, and the brisket with 2 sides. The sides we got were the mac n cheese and fries. OMG!!! Everything on that plate was fantastic and we had no complaints at all.   I can't speak for her, but I know I will be coming back here again. Especially for those yummy flavorful ribs!!!",

The bacon wrapped jalapenos are as awesome as others have said - FRESH jalapenos, stuffed with jack cheese, wrapped in bacon and smoked until absolutely, mouth wateringly delicious! I could eat my own body weight in them!  I had the pulled pork barbeque, which was also excellent. It was perfectly smoky, and texture-wise it was still \"meaty\" (a lot of places in Charlotte has \"mushy\" BBQ, which is a crime against humanity). The portion of barbeque was fine, although I wish I'd ordered the large plate... it was just SO GOOD!  And the rumors that Midwood Smokehouse has the best mac and cheese in town? True! It's decadent and delicious, without being pretentious (no \"truffle oil\" here!) It tastes like the mac and cheese you remember grandma making... only better! I even got dessert: pecan cobbler. It's like pecan pie, only served warm, with vanilla cream on top. It was HEAVENLY, and warmed the cockles of this Southern boy's heart! It was almost too big for one person, but was so yummy that I just couldn't stop!  My only complaints about this place are that it's just too crowded (not that that's Midwood Smokehouse's fault!) and that service seemed a bit slow. I mean, the table service is fine, it just seemed to take a while to get stuff from the kitchen to the table. But hell, the food's so good that it's worth the wait! And the beer selection (and specials!) are really good, too.  I cannot recommend this place enough!",

The service, the ambience, the food, it's everything you want in a BBQ joint.   Personally, all the meats are delicious, but what I care about are the sides. In my humble opinion, they have the best collard greens in all of Charlotte. Don't forget to ask for their homemade pepper vinegar, because that just takes it over the top delicious. Midwood was actually the place that turned me into a collard eater, and I thank them for it. My husband swears by their Mac and cheese and will always get it as his side. It's the kind of Mac and cheese that you dig your fork in and the gooey strings of cheese follow the noodles all the way out of the bowl.   We had friends visiting that also do competition BBQ back in the northeast and they were able to see the whole smoker operation in the back, which I thought was a nice touch!",

Some of the pieces were quite dry (like turkey) and tough to eat.   I'd say it's a little better than the ny area bbq. But not as good as the Texas bbq I recently had...  not by far",

    "text": "I am shocked this place has 4.5 stars, and forgive me if I just ate the wrong thing, but I am being generous with 3 starts.  I went to this spot expecting excellent southern barbecue, but was thoroughly disappointed. The reviews put the thought in my mind, but at the end of the day, it was just barbecue, nothing worth writing home about. It might be that my standards for barbecue are now sky high, but at least give me meat that isn't dry.   I try brisket anywhere south of the Mason Dixon line now, and hope for the best, and that might be a mistake in specific cities, like Nashville, where ribs or another type of meat is prevalent and the 'best'. I wonder if that were the case for Midwood Smokehouse and Charlotte.   Well, the sides, the meat was all average. I was not impressed, and found the flavors to be lacking. The hushpuppies were fine, the mac and cheese was fine, etc.   Anyway, maybe another place on my next Charlotte trip to satiate me barbecue hunger!",

Tried sweet iced tea for the first time, am addicted to the stuff now. I wanted to try the peach cobbler but they were out of it (emphasizing on the freshness of the food). Instead I ordered the banana pudding(if I'm not wrong, it was a banana dessert though.) Loved it.  I left this place, utterly satisfied.",

    "text": "I can't believe that there is a Dick's Last Resort style BBQ joint in Charlotte! All kidding aside, the food was delicious: the brisket was perfectly moist (the lean was not cooked long enough because there was no fatty separation at all), the greens were tender, the bacon wrapped stuffed peppers were to die for. Unfortunately, the service ruined everything. I ordered the brisket and one of the slices was all fat (see picture). I showed the server and asked if I could get another slice, but she decided to have a debate with me about the fatty slice. I asked for a manager, but she refused, so I asked another server. The manager (pretty loudly) defended the server by explaining how great  of a server she is, which was noble of her to do, but I don't respect servers (or establishments that defend such servers) who want to get into augments with their guests/customers. Fortunately there was a server switch, who did an amazing job. We finally got our appetizer that we never received until we were half way done with the meal. The manager comped our whole meal, which we didn't ask for, which gave the place the 3rd star (the 1st star is a given, the second is due to the great service we received from the second server and decent meal). Many of the servers didn't seem happy to be there which gives the place a negative vibe. The two hosts standing at the door never said bye or thank you nor attempted to open the door while I was carrying my baby through the door. I would give this place 2.5 stars if I could. Please work on your FOH staff.",

Occasionally we get the platter with different types of meat and share that and we always have left overs.

    "text": "After two visits, Midwood Smokehouse BBQ and Bar has become my current favorite BBQ place in Charlotte.  I say current, as things can happen to take that status (and it's an important one) away.  One only needs to ask me about Mac's Speedshop where starting back in 2006 I would frequent at least once a month.  After too many instances of stale sandwich buns, so-so service, and so-so 'Cue...I haven't been back in probably 2 years.     A few weeks ago on a bright and warm Saturday, some of my friends came in from out-of -town to visit the CLT and they were looking for some tasty BBQ.  In the past this would have been a quick drive over to Mac's in the Southend.  However, this time I was searching my Yelp app for a new king of 'Cue.  This search took me to my first visit to the, Plaza Midwood located, Midwood Smokehouse BBQ/ Bar and my new number one.  Atmosphere - Crowded, lively, and happening, a darkly lit and noisy bar area, a bright and a little calmer dining room, and a packed with patrons patio space.  Service - Despite our server seeming crushed from the craziness that a nice day brings to a place with a patio, he kept it together and provided prompt service.  The server was quick and thoughtful in offering suggestions, though I knew what I wanted to have...the Carolina Pork BBQ Plate.  Food - Great!  As mentioned above I ordered the Carolina Pork BBQ Plate.  I opted for the small portion, which comes with hushpuppies, pickled onions, and one side (I ordered sweet potato fries).  Despite being busy, the food arrived quickly and hot.  I tasted some of the pulled pork immediately before dressing it with the table placed sauces...it was excellent!  While Midwood Smokehouse does lightly dress the pulled pork in their Eastern NC vinegar sauce prior to serving, all I could taste was smoky goodness.  The pork was lean, flavorful, and juicy.  The sweet potato fries were good and the hushpuppies on this visit were awesome, with a light crunch and a soft, cake donut like center.  Everything was perfect!    Being a bar too, Midwood Smokehouse has a nice selection of beers, including the local offerings from OMB, Triple C Brewing, and NODA.       Overall - While you may have read this review and expected to see a 5 Star rating...I gave 4 Stars.  Why 4 Stars??  Well, as stated in the beginning of my review it was the result of two visits that made Midwood Smokehouse my king of 'Cue.  The absence of a star comes down to consistency.  I was so enamored on my first visit, as described above, my second visit occurred a mere four days later.  It was a Wednesday; the shine had come off on my new trophy winner.  While the pulled pork on this visit was just as good the portion seemed a little smaller and the hushpuppies I received to me seemed dry and old tasting.  Despite a little downturn on my second visit, I think the solid nature of their pulled pork makes Midwood Smokehouse some of the best BBQ Charlotte has to offer.  With that I will be back again with friends!",

    "text": "My wife and I gave this place a try way back when it first opened and we thought it was terrible and haven't been back since.  Last night we were in Plaza Midwood with family who wanted BBQ so we decided to give it another shot. WOW, you've come a long way Midwood Smoke House!!  There were 4 of us and everyone was very pleased with their dinners which included shredded chicken, salad with pulled pork, smoked wings and the burnt ends plate.   The shredded chicken was good but this was the least impressive meal of the bunch. It lacked smoke flavor and almost had a 'watered down' taste. The burnt ends dinner was excellent. The meat has a good smoke flavor, it was moist and tender to the point you could cut it with a fork. I did however think that for an $18.50 dinner the meat portion was a little on the small side. The smoked wings were very good, cooked perfect.  The salad with pulled pork was large and although I didn't try it I was told it was excellent as well.   The sides, I was able to try the mac and cheese, greens and BBQ beans. Mac and cheese is on point. It is moist and has a great flavor unlike at some places were it dries out and has a bland taste. The collard greens were really good, not to salty as they can be from time to time and had a nice amount of meat mixed in. The BBQ beans were a hit as well.   If you're like us and tried this place a while ago and weren't happy it is definitely worth a second try, they seem to have come into their own and it's pretty dam good now.",

Not only are the meats and sauces very flavorful, but the portions are very good, the prices reasonable and the service staff has always been attentive. Of course, there are many other things to eat besides barbecue, but let's face it, that's what everyone comes here for. The other dishes are great as well, sandwiches, salads etc but the barbecue is awesome and that's what's going to bring you back.",

My fiance and I went out to dinner with a couple friends and when plans fell through at another establishment because of a storm (closed kitchen), Midwood Smokehouse pulled through! First off, I would like to compliment our waiter Cameron for his excellent customer service! He was very personable and provided us with great recommendations for both food and drinks. I got the pulled pork platter with macaroni and cheese and cole slaw and it was amazing! The burnt ends would be another fantastic choice (a little bit fatty, but good!) It was kind of loud when we were there, I think they turned the music up loud to offset the alarm that was going off because of the storm, but that was out of their control! I've dined at this particular location several times along with the Ballantyne location, but this will be my go to for BBQ! Awesome experience overall! Ask for Cam!!",

Atmosphere & location come in second to the food I would think.   Haven't been here in 5-6 months but was looking forward to the BBQ chicken and those golden mini crinkle fries they cook to perfection.   Well, things have changed in those 5-6 months. The sauce for the chicken now comes on side, and those mini crinkle fries were not so golden. In fact, they were 1 step from disgusting. Way undercooked. The chicken was good but it was way better when the sauce was seared into the meat. I don't normally eat the hush puppies but they turned out to be the best thing on the plate.   On a brighter note, the service was excellent. Drew (man bun) has been there a while and is top notch. But I'm not sure when I will return. There are so many new restaurants opening in Charlotte and I continue to be on the prowl looking for the ones that make me go WOW! Midwood has been knocked way down on my list after today.",

I tried the Cheddar chicken bacon sandwich, and it was just pure deliciousness, despite the fact that I'm a stickler for crispy, lean bacon, which this particular sandwich did not provide. The same can be said for the jalapeno bacon cheddar bites, but I just worked around it.  The pulled pork tasted very good, the idea of chopping barbecue in North Carolina is an interesting concept.  The whole place looked like something you would find in maybe D.C or downtown Atlanta or someplace. It was a pleasant experience.",

First, our food was incredible we had chicken nachos, stockyard and el fuego tacos, brisket and creamed corn. All of our food was incredible, delicious,hot and satisfying. Our table wait time was approx 25 mins, also satisfactory.   The problem was the 22 mins we waited for our drinks after being seated. Over 30-45minutes seated before our app appeared. The manager recognized the problem and comped our nachos(very nice). What gets worse is we waited another 30-45 for our dinner. We arrived before 8pm and didn't leave until after 10pm. Drinks should be served around 5 mins, apps should be around 20 mins and entrees around 40 mins. Not cool",

Great service from our waitress, who kept the conversation going and kept the beers filled.  We split a plate of the pimento cheese fries. Plenty here for three, but we put a good dent in it. Lots of great cheese, good grilling that toasted the fries and melted the cheese all the way down.  For barbecue, my friend had the four meat sampler and enjoyed it. He said that the sausage was particularly tasty. I had the pulled pork, with mac & cheese. It did not need any extra sauce. The pork was chopped fine, which made it a little mushy. Next time, I'll go for the sliced brisket perhaps.  Overall, still great to visit and still great to bring your visitors.",

Wings we're so flavorful and delicious it was unreal! For my plate I had the pig out portion of the meat combo and got mixed brisket with burnt ends and double ribs. They were all very good but not the best BBQ I've ever had and the portion seemed kinda small even though I ordered the larger one.  Brisket and burnt ends stole the show for the entrees.  My mom got the burger with brisket and it was fantastic, definitely recommend looking for a massive and delicious burger.  Desert was great, I didn't know pecan Cobbler was a thing but O man was it delicious! Apple pie was on special for the day and it melted my heart it was so good! Best BBQ I've had in the Carolina's and the service was very friendly.  Unfortunately they have a tiny bathroom and unneeded to go the entire time but it was in use from the moment I walked in to when we left so that kinda dampened the experience but I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a great BBQ experience.",

The jalapenos were a little soggy so that was disappointing and the brisket was a bit on the dry side for my liking. The ribs did not fail and I devoured them happily. I did dessert last time and was not extremely impressed but maybe that has improved - however I did not revisit that tonight so I cannot comment. My server, Christopher, was awesome and super helpful. Great balance of social and helpful without being overwhelming. If you are craving BBQ this is a great option",

Also, it was very affordable - ~$12 per person.   The restaurant was very crowded during lunch on a weekend, so I would recommend calling in advance.",

    "text": "Well worth the hour wait on a Friday evening: they've got burnt ends! We first tried burst ends in South Carolina and have been searching for them ever since. We put our names in at Midwood Smokehouse and loved that they texted us when our table was ready an hour later [we walked down the street to the Thirty Beaver, the sketchiest dive bar EVER, while we waited!] We'd heard great things about Midwood but were ecstatic upon examining the menu that they serve burnt ends!   We ordered a large burnt ends plate to split with BBQ baked beans, bacon wrapped jalapenos and hushpuppies for sides. I'd skip the baked beans next time, but everything else was stellar. Honestly, I wasn't super hungry, so it was easy to split the large plate, but if we hadn't been tasting as many things in Charlotte as we could, we would definitely have had to order two plates. Also, I was surprised that the large $18.00 plate wasn't bigger then it was. Again, we weren't at full hunger, but if we were, I would've been disappointed. Midwood is a little pricier then most BBQ joints, but it is dang tasty. I might recommend grabbing an appetizer at a local restaurant while you wait instead of going balls-to-the-wall here.",

Full disclosure, I'm vegetarian, so the meat reviews are second hand from my meatetarian husband.  He had a three-meat combo plater of ribs, brisket, and turkey. He said it was the best brisket he'd had in his life...and that's a long time. LOL. I had a three sides combo of mac and cheese, coleslaw, and smoked veggies. All very yummy. We started with hush puppies and the surprisingly tasty, but artery clogging, pimiento cheese fries. Our server was helpful and friendly, too. We'll definitely go back to Midwood Smokehouse!",

Evidently success has ruined the effort given and the portion sizes seem to be shrinking.   My entree last night was $40...a large sampler platter with double ribs so that I could sample both preparation styles, with both cuts of brisket (props for offering lean or fatty) and the sausage (which I had enjoyed on my first visit.  Beans and corn for sides.    Neither style of ribs was edible...tried as I might.  The waitress was friendly and fairly prompt with beverage refills prior to food being delivered, but no check back for quality.  When the waitress finally asked, she didn't believe me that the ribs were terrible- didn't send a manager, and disappeared after processing checks for our party of 6.  Sorry- neither value nor good ribs to be found here....",

The atmosphere is a bit more modern than some of the other BBQ spots I checked out in eastern NC, but the food was just as good.  For starters, we ordered the cheese fries topped with bits of brisket burnt ends, and those are currently the best appetizer I've tried anywhere in the country. I ate so many I wasn't sure I was going to be able to tackle my main course.  I ordered a full rack of ribs with beans & fries for a side. Since I had already sampled the Eastern NC style vinegar sauce, I went with the SC mustard based sauce, and I absolutely LOVED it! My friends weren't huge fans, but this is my Yelp review, not theirs.   The rack was MASSIVE, and not too tender, which made it great for dunking in the mustard sauce. My buddy also ordered a rack, but with the house special BBQ sauce, which was also really good. The portion sizes were exactly what I expected, and the sweet tea was extra sweet.  For dessert, I took home a pecan cobble and absolutely fell in love. I haven't been able to stop eating pecan pies & cobblers since!",

    "text": "I cannot believe almost 6 months later and I am just now writing this review!  When I was on vacation in June and visiting my sister, she wanted me to try out a 'cue place she told me was pretty solid.  I am indeed a huge fan of Carolina style cue, so I was excited to see how this place would fare against Memphis.  Hidden away in hipsterville, this place is nestled on the bottom left of a I think 2 story strip mall.  There was some construction behind the place, so with that being said, parking was real tight- but I managed to find a spot on the street (and didn't get towed!).  The weather was perfect to eat on the patio, but we decided to eat inside.  Inside, it looked like there were 2 rooms, separated by the bar.  We sat in the bar area- which was cool, because our server was hot as hell- hell yea!  When we got the menus, I was torn about what to get, but I was hungry as hell too- so I got enough food for 3 people- the whole rack of ribs an order of some bacon wrapped jalapenos, and some other stuff.  My sis got a plate of pork with some sweet potato fries.  It looked like they had a pretty solid beer and mixed menu- but the Kentucky slush won me over.  I think I only got 1 (didn't want to get shwasted by 2, even though it was vacay).  It was pretty tasty, but I found it funny they served it in a Shiner (a TX beer) mason jar.  Hell yea!  When the food came out, my eyes opened up wide.  It looked as good as the place smelled.  I tell you what- I will say it again, this is the kind of shit I live for- and those were good enough to be in the top 5 racks of ribs to ever touch these lips.  And It left me full as hell.  I have no idea how I did it, but I dommed the whole plate!  Believe it or not, I didn't get sick either!  However, I did take a nap after the meal :)  A lot of eye candy, solid food and drinks are always a plus in my book.  The place seemed clean as well and they had tvs to keep you entertained if you didn't feel like conversing with your sister.  If parking wasn't such a pain, I would push the 4.5 up to 5 stars!

Perfect bit of crunch and great flavor, plus it's hard to find burnt ends in Charlotte. It comes with a spicy bbq sauce that fits perfectly with the meat. They have recommended bbq sauces or a large variety that you can try with your meat as well.  The sides are definitely unique, as they have much more than the normal bbq sides, including the delicious bacon wrapped jalapenos! These were definitely a favorite (you can get it as an appetizer as well.)  They have a good beer list showcasing some of the best of Charlotte beers, but also some classics as well. I went on a Saturday night and there was a pretty big wait, but luckily there's a lot in the area so you can explore (they will text you when your table is ready.)  Overall, would highly recommend to get your bbq fix!",

Delicious pulled pork, perfectly cooked sweet potato fries and a bowl of cold slaw I would have literally dove into if I could have.  Exactly the meal we were looking for  you won't be disappointed!",

The ribs were top notch with great BBQ sauce!!  The only drawback for me was the men's room.... It had a very strong stench of urine and just wasn't very clean.  But I feel like bathrooms should be both the staff and patron's responsibility to keep clean..... That's just my opinion.  The price was very fair I thought.  The food was very good!!

I also love the sloppy joe and grown up grilled cheese which have all the flavors of childhood with enough flavor for my adult tastebuds!

The meat was perfectly smoked with intense smoke, but not too much.  Moist, delicious and even better when dipped in the three sauces brought with the platter.  Pickled onions and hushpuppies along with the bbq slaw and bacon wrapped jalepenos rounded out my dinner.  Pretty reasonable price for a great meal in a nice, upscale environment.",

Vinegar and bbq sauce was average to good.  The sausage link was not to my taste but overall food, drink and staff were really good.",

The Brisket and the BBQ Ribs are my go to staples here. You won't go wrong with either. As far as sides here go, my favorites are the macaroni and cheese along with the baked beans. Pure goodness.   Pro Tip: Try to avoid weekend crowds if you can. Go during the week when they have time to prepare the food the right way. I've come on weekends and sometimes they struggle maintaining their weekday quality.",

It added about and hour and 20 mins to our journey, we didn't get to Virginia until about 4 am, but this was worth it!  First, we came in pretty close to closing time and no one batted an eyelash about it! All the southern hospitality, even sitting at the bar, the whole time!  Most importantly- the food was BEYOND my expectations! I got the fatty brisket, against my typical judgment call because in my past experiences brisket ends up just being dry as hell. But this was not that! It was juicy, it fell apart and it was incredible! The greens I got were seasoned perfectly, and the Mac and cheese was the kind of homemade experience you'd want.   My mom got ribs and she was just as satisfied! I tried one of them and she was right to feel that way- the same fall off the bone tenderness, smoky yet flavorful and all around satisfying!  I want to go back here. Like now. I had intended to save my leftovers for my boyfriend to try when I got back to NY but alas, it was just too good to share!",

We came this time around 7 on a Wednesday night. They told us there would be a 25 minute wait, but ended up being able to seat us a few minutes later.   I've had a variety of different things here and have never been disappointed. This time, we decided to get the pimiento cheese fries with pulled pork and the Midwood Grilled Cheese with brisket. Both of them were delicious as always. We got mac and cheese as  our side which is amazing (also good with baked beans). We added on a side of hush puppies which were really good. If you have room for dessert, the banana pudding is amazing.   This is definitely a must try Charlotte restaurant that I highly recommend trying if you haven't yet!",

We were seated outside at a sort of zip up patio with heaters. Once I zipped up the awning I was fine.  Brittney was our waitress and she was awesome with draft beer recommendations, meat recommendations, and desserts.  My wife and I ordered the pig out to share. Our meats were the ribs, brisket, burnt end (substituted for an extra fee), and pork. Sides were mac and cheese and creamed corn along with Texas Toast.  Let me tell you the meats were delicious. While I wouldn't characterize the ribs as fall off the bone they were extremely moist and well seasoned. The briscuit was equally good as were the burnt ends. The meats had a good bark and smoke flavor to them.  Brittney was so kind to explain the sauces to us. My favorite by far was the habanero sauce. The pork took a back seat to the above three. If I were to do it again then I would skip the pork to see if I could double up on the other meats.  We finished with a dessert. Heck, we went both the pecan pie and banana cream. I read other Yelp reviews about the banana cream being good. It sure was. The pecan pie was warm and came with a scoop of ice cream. Ultimately, the banana cream won out as my favorite! Next time I will order just a large banana cream and skip the pecan pie.  Overall, it was a really enjoyable meal with an awesome waitress in Brittney! I will definitely return next time in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I came here after seeing the impressive Yelp rating this restaurant held in this area and was not disappointed. It was so delicious that I can't imagine coming back to town and not stopping here to enjoy a meal. The meal started off with queso dip and tortilla chips which was served piping hot and you can choose to top it off with some meat for an additional two dollars. I ordered a combo platter which was called \"pig out\" that allowed you to pick four different cuts of bbq served with two sides, pickled onions, and hushpuppies. The four cuts of meat I chose to go with were bbq ribs, carolina chopped pork, shredded chicken, and brisket. The brisket was charred on the outside and extremely tender and moist on the inside. It was absolutely delicious. In addition to the brisket, the ribs were by far the best ribs I have ever had, and I have had a ton of ribs in my day. Mixed with a dry rub and finger licking good sauce, the ribs were fell off the bone and had a ton of meat.   I did not care so much for the chicken as much as the other cuts but I am a little bias since I am not a big fan of poultry in general. The waitress also was nice enough to bring out three different types of bbq sauce so I was able to experience the goodness full circle from vinegar, mild bbq, and a sweeter habanero bbq sauce.   To round out my gut busting meal I ordered a small banana pudding that was life changing. I used to work down the street from Magnolias but I have to say, this banana pudding blew theirs out of the water. Save room for this banana pudding, it is speckled with fresh sliced bananas, laced with creamy light pudding, and topped with crunchy vanilla wafers.   All in all, I would say to skip appetizers, get a combo platter if its your first time here, and get the banana pudding. Banana pudding is a must!",

This is the place where I take my parents and out of town we friends to for some good bbq.   Personally I love the burnt ends and will order a large to get two sides and some leftovers.   For sides, I always get the Mac & cheese and then split between either the sweet potatoes fries or normal fries. I have a peanut, nut, and shellfish allergy so I don't often get to eat fried food, but the head chef here has a peanut allergy so this place is great to come to and have no worries.   Finally, I always, without a doubt, get the banana pudding! It's absolutely delicious and a must have from this place.   One small downfall is since the Plaza Midwood location doesn't take reservations, you could have a long wait.",

I also tried the hush puppies which were good, a salmon salad which was great and of course sweet potato fries! I also had the banana pudding which is something that I am trying to get used to eating and I enjoyed it. Everything was Fantastic! Not only did we have the manager come but the general manager which is rare! They were both AMAZING! This is what a restaurant should aim to be.",

You get to choose 4 different types of meats with 2 sides. We ordered the St Louis ribs, burnt ends, pulled pork and beef brisket. For sides, we got the mac n cheese and the bacon wrapped jalapenos. I loved everything!! The St Louis ribs were my absolutely favorite! It was so tender, juicy, and perfectly flavored with a dash of sweetness and a lot of savory-ness. The burnt ends and beef brisket are also a must-try. If you want really good pulled pork, you should definitely check out Mac's Speedshop!! The pulled pork at Midwood was good but the one at Mac's is GOOOOOD.",

Great sides, beans were great comfort food and the smoked vegetables tasted good. Pulled pork was good, but I wouldn't consider it exceptional.  Meh: Brisket cuts were too fatty, couldn't really taste the beef flavor. Sausage was alright, but nothing exceptional.   Cons: The sauces were not good. We were provided two sauces, presumably a spicy and a mild one. The mild sauce was alright, but too runny and the flavor was mediocre. The spicy sauce had little viscosity and wasn't really what you'd consider a sauce.  Overall: Get the ribs. The other meats you could likely pass on and not miss out too much. The sauces were pretty disappointing, but luckily the ribs are great without anything additional.",

Found parking on the street outside and stepped inside to a casual restaurant with friendly service.    Started off with the bacon wrapped jalapenos.  Was on a phone call, chatting away and next thing I knew, they were gone.    And then the BBQ arrived...  Carolina Pork-Smoked, tender, flavorful and exactly what I've been missing.  I'd like to consider myself  a memphis bbq connoisseur; however, this pork was excellent in its own right.  And that vinegar sauce?  I'm not a fan of sweet sauces and their sauce's blend of vinegar and spices was a perfect pairing.  I didn't need anything else, but the goodness didn't stop there.  Creamed Corn-creamy & buttery perfection. Hush Puppies-WHAT?!  I haven't had Hush Puppies this good since 1987 in the bootheel of Missouri.  Excellent BBQ and sides and Highly Recommend.",

For my meal, I got the \"large\" burnt ends, which includes six tough brisket cubes, a cup of mac n' cheese, and a good handful of sweet potato fries for $18.50. My wife got the \"large\" pulled pork plate. The pork was dry, like really dry, even with sauce. As for her sides, she chose collards and creamed corn. Both were okay.   Our server seemed to keep forgetting about us. It was frustrating to finish our meal and sit there waiting 20 mins for our check. Then when she brought our check, my debit card wasn't there. After she walks away, I'm looking around for her to to tell her that it was missing and I see it sitting in the middle of two tables on the ground. Now, it must have fallen out of the sleeve and I'm not mad at her about that. But it just kind of the cherry on top of our crappy experience. If you're looking for good BBQ, you won't find it here.",

At least the sweet potato fries were good and service was on the better side.  So that pleased me well enough.    Given that Midwood Smokehouse is such a sought after lunch joint, do anticipate a bit of a wait.  I think we waited around twenty or thirty minutes - sufficient time to cram in a game of cornhole.  I killed it, that's what vegans kill . .. games?  Nice touch offering this distraction during the wait!

I was especially enamored with the Eastern NC vinegar sauce.  If it wasn't for the liquid restriction on carry-on items, I would've tried to bring a bottle home.  Maybe I should've tried to portion it out to 3oz bottles.  The mustard sauce that came with the Chicken BBQ was also awesome.  I felt like it would be great to have with a soft pretzel too.  Sadly, those aren't on the menu.  Prices are extremely reasonable for the portion sizes.  I wish I had gone all out and tried the combo platter just to get more options in.  Next time.",

    "text": "I was in Carolina so I had to get some Carolina BBQ.  Midwood Smokehouse had some high ratings and a bunch of reviews so I had to try them.  When I came in the parking lot was full, a good sign of they must be good. They have a nice indoor and outdoor dining areas and a rooftop dining area with an awesome view. Overall it was OK.  I went with two small plates of BBQ just to sample a variety of the menu. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/midwood-smokehouse-charlotte#H2NatZtWVPmD9ZZyAuwwRQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/midw...</a>  The first plate I'll call it the South Carolina plate <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/midwood-smokehouse-charlotte#Sfxrntd0tSFhc9eIVqU-PA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/midw...</a> it was a plate of smoked pulled chicken, South Carolina mustard sauce, bacon wrapped jalapenos, and hush puppies.  The pulled chicken wasn't that bad for chicken pretty dry, the SC mustard sauce was tasty, and bacon wrapped jalapenos and hush puppies were MEH.  The second plate I'll call it the North Carolina plate <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/midwood-smokehouse-charlotte#GtO6lixO30zEUv7twrDXPA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/midw...</a> it was a plate of smoked pulled pork, Eastern NC vinegar sauce, BBQ slaw, and hush puppies.  The pulled pork was good but not amazing, the NC vinegar sauce OK, the BBQ slaw not my favorite.  So which BBQ wins this matchup SC or NC BBQ? Hard to say I wasn't wowed by either but NC wins just because the pulled pork tasted better.  I don't think it was a good representation of what SC and NC BBQ was. Not recommending any of those plates. Maybe try something else their ribs, wings, and fries look good. Since I can't try them I have to keep it neutral 3 rating, BARELY, for their food.     They have a nice atmosphere, friendly service, and a full bar. The outdoor patio has ceiling fans perfect for when dining outside on warm days.  They have random decorations; one that stood out was the Hawaii license plate that started with a 'K'.  If it starts a 'K' it usually means Kauai but it seems like whenever see a Hawaii license plate hanging on the wall it starts with a 'K' now. There's a cool mural on the wall of the building behind of Midwood Smokehouse.",

    "text": "For openers, if you believe the best barbecue is usually found in a bad part of town in a place with bars on the windows and just enough grease on the table to write your intials, then this isn't it.  If, on the other hand, you think good barbecue can be found in a funky part of town, with tons of other places to eat in every direction, then Midwood BBQ may be for you.  Actually, I suggest calling it Midwood BBBBQ... this is another of those places that has grown to the point that it's a Big Bucks BBQ place complete with a real people bar and more televisions than needed, much less appreciated.  Parking is yet another issue and don't be surprised if there's a wait.  For someone who has spent a lifetime in search of the perfect barbecue, Midtown has several things going for it, but, in reality it's a big sports bar that has some decent barbecue.  Let's start with the service and the decor: folks are there to greet and seat you when you come through the door, a smiling face to who quickly takes your drink order, clean tables with the now-it's-almost required rolls of paper towel, a beer signs from brews gone by, photos from Charlotte's earlier days and at least one television per wall in the bar and in the main dining room. There's also some sidewalk tables.  We opted for a couple of their better known appetizers, fried pickles and bacon wrapped jalapenos, a half dozen bucks. And that's the first rub...   the bacon wrapped Jalapenos were at the highlight of the entire meal, followed by the Hush Puppies and then a tie between the souped up baked beans and the Mac n Cheese - and when the sides outshine the protein offerings there's a problem.  That's not the way it's supposed to be.  The situation is reversed at most barbecue joints: the meats get all the attention and the sides, all too often, come out of a can or the freezer. Not so at Midwood's Smokehouse... and for the real barbecue zealot there for low and slow cooked meats, too many TVs, beer choices and sides can be a distraction.  The ribs, as a for instance, literally fell off the bone. Why?  Were they parboiled, or baked, and then tossed on the grill?  Steamed (to tenderize) before they were served? If any of the aforementioned, that's not low and slow over a bed of smoldering wood.  That's cheating.     To give credit where due, the brisket was exceptional... just enough fat left to provide real good (and moist) flavor. And the pulled pork was almost as good and served in the same generous portion.  The chicken was on the dry side.  For the Brown Shoe Gourmet's taste, their homemade sauce (smoky and sweet) worked best. An alien at the table preferred the vinegar based which brings up another point: this is a North Carolina barbecue joint that shows more of a leaning to Texas 'cue than Carolina style... the brisket, the jalapenos being good examples.  For a guy who has spent a lifetime in pursuit of the perfect barbecue (read more than 70 other barbecue reviews), this certainly isn't it... but it's fairly good with some exceptional sides, friendly folks and exceptional service.  Worth the effort if you can find parking, worth the effort if there's a game you want to see, a specific beer you've a thirst for, and are up for some fair to middlin' 'cue.",

I was struggling because the mac and cheese apparently is awesome. I stuck with my new found healthy eating habits and grabbed a salad. After much deliberation I decided on the chopped salad with pulled pork. Great recommendation by my server! I added jalapenos because i like it spicy and my pickled onions on the side (which come with every meal, unless you get a salad). It was a quick lunch and well deserved but I had to get back to the office, but I will definitely be coming back here again.",

    "text": "Your review helps others learComing from Kansas City, I KNOW what good BBQ is!  I was very impressed.  Nothing I tried was even mediocre in the slightest.  I highly recommend the ribs in Habanero BBQ sauce.  They don't even need extra sauce.  The brisket was amazing in its own right, particularly with the crust.  I completely enjoyed the beans, the corn and my God...  the sauces!!  The pork was decent and was exceptional with the variety of sauces to add on.  I would also say that the sausage is amazing.  Most of the reviews on here don't tout the sausage and I don't know why!  Dip it in their variety of mustards and you've got a real winner.  It was nice to have the hush puppies as an add on to dip with, etc.  Now, if this isn't enough to convince you, the people make it a spectacular experience indeed!  Both of my servers were absolute sweethearts and made me feel very welcome.  I would not have been surprised if I had been invited to go to a party afterwards.  Just incredibly warm people.  Richie Haddox the manager even stopped by several times to check on me and treated me to some great conversation as well as a little extra sauce.  ;-)  An awesome experience to be sure!  These people know good BBQ and exceptional customer service.  Its too easy to find average or even bad customer service these days.  Tragic commentary on where we've come to as a society.  Not at Midwood Smokehouse, however.  I'm definitely coming back the next time I'm in town, and to my buds back home... get ready!  I'm bringing home some killer sauce!n about great local businesses.

    "text": "Lunch, 6/2/14, seated immediately, friendly and knowledgeable hostess. I am an Eastern Style NC aficionado, having eaten it all my life. Others at the table did not have this bias. [g]  Of the items I tried, I'll make comment. Ice tea rather bitter and watery, $2.00. Tasting the sauces -- 5 of them -- was great. I don't know if this is offered to every new customer but it should be. The one with the Habernero was my favorite and really well balanced. The Eastern style sauce was good, actually very good, but just a tiny bit on the sweet side (as Bob Garner said). But seriously, ask for the sauce tasting if you don't get it; they arrive steaming hot.  Stars of the show: The fatty brisket. You must request it well marbled, and it beats anything I ever had in two driving trips across Texas. Next in line would be the ribs. Request them without sauce and use the sauce tray you earlier requested. They were moist, tender, and not too much char. Third star was the sausage. It's a rather sophisticated blend with a natural casing; they don't grind it there but they smoke it there.  The hush puppies are fine, though probably started out as a mix. On this day, the macaroni and cheese was just too dry and one dimensional; I would not order it again. The collards were great, without as much grease as my grandma used.  I do not recommend the fine chopped pork. The flavor is not quite there and the chop is too fine for my taste, but I've met old barbeque masters who prefer it that way. The vinegar/pepper sauce wakes it up for sure. I asked about banana pudding and was told that they use the old time method with Nilla Vanilla Wafers; that's something to try next time.",

I had the sausage, macaroni and cheese, and sweet potato fries.  It was a large portion for the price.  The sausage wasn't listed as a combo plate, just as a meat for the 4 meat combo, but I was able to order it anyway.  She had the macaroni and cheese, with added brisket, and ate every bite.  The bacon wrapped jalapenos had seeds removed, which I liked, since spicy food is not my favorite.",

I just know good food :)  We tried the brisket tacos, sausage, chicken... sausage was YUM and a large is more than enough for 2 to share.  Sweet tea is VERY sweet, even with 1/2 and 1/2.

Though it was my first visit, I was expecting, at least a mediocre sandwich, at best. What I first discovered, was a bread sandwich, with a small amount of pork barbeque, atop a 4\" bun. The barbeque tasted less than mediocre.  True Eastern NC Barbeque is from the WHOLE HOG, not from butts and/or shoulders. I don't mind paying $8 for a great sandwich; but one that was so disappointing as this one was, I wouldn't pay $4 for it. Also, the crinkle-cut fries were cold. You'd think that for $8, they'd cut fresh taters and fry them. I suggest doing your homework about NC Style Barbeque. Seasoned Apple-Cider Vinegar is used and it's Chopped.",

I am not one to get sick easily from food and when I do it is from very bad food. I know this place is popular and a lot of people seem to love it but to each his own. On top of the food being bad, I felt the service was horrible. It took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and take a drink order. I mentioned that the soda was flat. My server looked at me with an annoyed facial expression like I was wrong. She asked if I wanted anything else and I said no and asked if it could just be changed. Apparently it was too much work to change the soda.  I noticed a girl was getting sick at her table so now I'm wondering if she got sick from the food too. I did call the restaurant tonight and the lady I spoke to was nice but didn't seem to acknowledge the seriousness of the food causing a customer to get sick. She said I may have gotten a bug from somewhere else. The sickness I am feeling is definitely from their food. I don't think anything will be done about this and that really bothers me because this is a serious issue.  I unfortunately will not be returning there and again, I won't be surprised if nothing is done about this",

Pulled pork? Check. Half chicken? Check. Sausages? Check. Brisket? Technically not check tonight but its opening weekend, cut them some slack. And all of it comes with one (or more if you ask) of their 3 delicious sauces: the tomato-y Midwood house sauce, the vinegar based NC sauce or the mustard based SC sauce.  We split the BBQ Queso dip, which was out of this world. The smoked flavor of the meat went great with the ooey, gooey cheese. I got the small pulled pork plate which comes with NC sauce, one side, hushpuppies and pickled onions. The meat was great. I had to literally smoosh my napkin in my food to stop from picking once i was full. The collard greens I got as my side were cooked within an inch of their life, but thats not uncommon and I guess better than them being tough. They did have meat in them, but our server said they have a veggie friendly section of the menu in the works. The pickled onions were great to cut through the smoky meat flavor. As for the pups, I heartily recommend dipping them in some of the SC sauce.  They have a solid beer menu, on draft, in bottles and in cans.  All the better if you enjoy them outside at one of their picnic table or on the rooftop patio they are redoing.  Midwood Smokehouse is certainly a welcome addition to the Plaza Midwood restaurant scene (especially now that Rib Palace closed), not perfect but lip smacking none the less.",

    "text": "Looking for a new place to eat last Thursday, my team at work and I stumbled upon this new place on Central Avenue. First piece of advice: get there before Noon if you want to find a seat. This place is small and fills up quickly! Parking was a little tricky as well!  Second piece of advice: If there's a wait for a table, grab a bar stool and let Karen take care of you! If she makes cocktails half as good as she makes recommendations and serves food, then she's the best bartender in town! She was funny, accommodating and quick to help us make our choices from the very expansive menu of yummy southern barbeque menu items.  Enough about the atmosphere...let's talk food! We started with the queso. I think it's the first queso I've ever ordered with barbeque. You had your choice of beef or pork. We went with the beef. A great way to start the meal!   One of my friends got the Chicken Salad sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was so large, she took half home for a great dinner. My other friend got the beef brisket. She fancies herself a brisket expert and she gave this two greasy thumbs up! Her side of choice was the mac-n-cheese which she said tasted like a cheese dream!  Everything looked so good, I had to just close my eyes and point. I got the pork sandwich with a side of creamed corn. The corn was gone quickly because it was sweet and tasty with a bite of peppery that would slip up on you at the end of each bite. As I didn't want to make a total fool of myself by drinking the creamy goodness, my friend offered me one of her hushpuppies which I baptized in the creamed corn cup in the name of the Beef, and the Pork and the Chicken!   We got dessert to go and snuck into my office at 3 p.m. to delight in the Pecan Cobbler and Banana Pudding. The cobbler was yummy, a little like Derby Pie if you're familiar with that. I'm not that big of a fan of Banana Pudding, but this was probably the best I've ever eaten. A large dose of vanilla made this less on the banana side and more just yummy pudding, but I didn't complain and the three of us had enough dessert to taste test on two different occasions.   The only complaint I have about Midwood Smokehouse? That it's way too small and too far away from my house in South Charlotte! I hope they expand soon and in my direction!",

I had the  BBQ sandwich, it was nothing special.  you can certainly find better BBQ in Charlotte -- no matter your \"style\" preference.   As a side, I had the bacon wrapped jalapenos,  definitely the highlight of my Midwood Smokehouse experience.  My husband had the fried bologna sandwich with the smoked veggies.  The smoked veggies had no taste of veggies and only tasted of smoke.  He was not a fan of his sandwich, because the cheese overtook the bologna.    The Midwood Smokehouse has fixed alot of the problems the former tenant had in regards to usage of space. The bar is no longer awkward and the set up is very spacious.   I would go back, but will wait a while for them to come into their own.  Maybe with a little time this place can be another great eatery in Plaza-Midwood.",

While the beans were very good, the mac and cheese was dry and congealed (not very appetizing at all). We also tried the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeno peppers. These were good, but nothing too special. We tried the Carolina Pork and the Burnt Ends. I was not a fan of the sauce on the Burnt Ends. The pork was good, we tried all the sauces and they were decent, but they were a little stingy on them. I love sauce and am use to having a squirt bottle full of sauce.

I do, however, from time to time get the habanero BBQ sauce which is awesome and has a nice kick!  The brisket is starting to become a favorite of mine but you definitely cannot go wrong with their pulled pork.  I am a sucker for the queso app with a little meat mixed in.  PBR is very cheap and I am all about it at this place.  Parking is scarce but you can definitely find a place across the street and across from the new apartments.  I usually get a sneaky take out when my wife works late but that is all screwed up since she will see this.  Midwood Smokehouse is a must go to spot if you are in the area and want some good BBQ.

Now unfortunately at this point in my life I can no longer eat beef or pork without suffering for the following 24 hours.  That being said, I still love going to BBQ restaurants for everything else on the menu.  Midwood Smokehouse has me covered with their turkey plate, salmon sammie, grilled cheese, any of the side dishes...all so good!!  And to go with it they usually (always?) have a decent beer on special for $3/pint.  Midwood is quickly becoming my go-to BBQ in Charlotte.",

We tried the beef brisket, the sausage, the pulled pork, and the chicken.  My favorite was the pulled pork.  The chicken had a mayo looking dressing which I was not feeling so I recommend doubling on the pulled pork because you get 4 meat options on the sampler.  the sampler also includes 2 side orders.  We selected the collard greens and the BBQ beans both excellent!  Seriously love me some Carolina BBQ!!!  Be prepared to wait in line here...it's worth it.",

Instead of Carolina, I ended up getting their special Saint Louis Style Pork Ribs with Midwood signature sauce on the side. I'm sure someone can tell me the difference with Carolina ribs. My favorite ribs are Memphis style dry rub but this wasn't it. Still, it was pretty close and the Saint Louis half rack was pretty darn good.  The hushpuppies were delicious and the collard greens surprisingly tasty and not overcooked or overly salty like 75% of Southern restaurants.   Our order took awhile to get to our table but our waitress was friendly. NoDa local brew while waiting was a big plus. Watching the World Series Champion San Francisco Giants beating the Kansas City Royals on TV was an even bigger plus!",

It was packed, but we were seated right away since just two of us. First time here I could say that I was impressed with their food and services.  When you walk in, it is very cool and clean atmosphere. Good for family and friends. Staffs were super friendly and attentive. They kept checking on us.   Their menu is on point. You can also find that they have a lot of selection of beer. My fiance ordered the combo platter: the Pig out! You can choose 4 out of 5 kind of meat you want and 2 sides. It came out with a huge portion and good for 2-4 people! They have 2 different BBQ sauces; tomato based and vinegar based. Since we are from Texas, we never liked vinegar based. But at this place, we said yes!!I ordered salmon sammie. It was good but not the best. We loved their bacon wrapped jalapeno! The best we've ever had. Not too much cream cheese it's what we like. For the sides, we loved sweet potato fries and hush puppies. They were just delicious.   There are plenty of parking spots in the back of the restaurant. We'd love to come back again!!!",

The Mac and cheese was creamy, cheesy and sinful, the hush puppies were crunchy, savory and golden brown. My sister got the nachos and they had ample Amounts of smoked chicken, lots of Queso and plenty of fixins. We had the banana pudding for dessert and it was pleasantly sweet, creamy, perfect banana flavor and just enough for everyone. 4 stars only took one star off for the Cole slaw, it was not as sweet or Tangy as I would have liked.",

Then I saw on TV that Obama and Hilary Clinton had stopped in so I knew then I had to check it out! So we headed there at about 5pm on a Saturday.   I had the dry rub ribs with sweet potato fries and a side of sliced brisket. He had the pulled pork with a side of burned ends. We specifically asked for side of just meat because we didn't want to make another full plate that came with more side items like fries, etc. So this is the easiest way if you want to sample the different types of meats they offer. Also, it wasn't expensive to add this on (something like $5 each).   I thought the price was excellent for what you got. The dry rub ribs were some of the meatiest and tastiest I ever had in Charlotte. I am giving this place 4 stars and not 5 because of the crowds, limited parking, and mediocre decor.",

I had to try the brisket burnt ends and they were wonderful.  I cook brisket at home, but can never get it to be this tender.  We know hushpuppies have calories, but they are also irresistible.  Our waiter was so friendly and the host came over to talk to us, too.  We felt like we were guests in their home and their enthusiasm for the restaurant shows why it is such a wonderful experience to eat there.",

We were told 30 minutes, but it ended up being 5 minutes to wait, we will take that! It doesn't look like there are many tables, I can see this place being very busy in the summer.  Because it is small, it gets loud easily.  When you walk in you immediately notice the smell - and start drooling! Good thing it was only a 5 minute wait.  Kevin and I had the platter, picked 4 meats: shredded chicken, pork, turkey, and ribs.  Sides were mac and cheese and stuffed jalapenos wrapped in bacon.  Turkey: just okay.  Would not go for this again though.  Shredded chicken: Good flavor, but did not stick out in my memory like the remaining meats.  Ribs: the meat fell off so easily and had an awesome smokey flavor! A++ ribs!  Pork: the smokey flavor and whatever seasoning they have on the pork is outstanding!!  I'm drooling just thinking about it again.  A+++++, the best pork ever!  They give you sauces to go with the pork.  They are just okay - they have mustard based, tomato based, and vinegar based sauces, the first two being my favorite.  I didn't really use them, not because they were okay, but because the pork was just so good, I didn't want to mess with the flavor!  Sides, both excellent.  Mac and cheese was a good homestyle kind and cheesy!  The jalapenos were something I've never had, so bad for you, but yet so good!  Service was outstanding.  We were greeted and welcomed by our server quickly.  He never let our drinks get low and was very helpful - said if we didn't like something he would find us something to like! Wanted us to have a great experience, and we did.  Love this place and will be back soon for more pork!",

While these were good I should have stuck with just the BBQ. I had the brisket tacos and the meat was excellent. By the end I was just eating the meat. Beer selection, which is a must for anywhere I eat, was great. I would recommend this place.",

The sweet potato fries are delicious. And I eat the roast veggies when I'm being healthy usually. They have a good take on the Moscow mule cocktail and their margaritas that have old bay on the glass with salt. Sort of a salty sweet smoky pairing for margaritas.",

I must admit that their smoked bacon wrapped jalapenos were tasty, but lacking any type of heat. Our waitress (Sheena/Sherra) said that too many customers complained that they were too hot, so they now remove all the seeds...booo!  Moving on, our meal was \"SLAP YOUR MOMMA\" delicious. Their grilled veggies were perfect, the chopped salad with green goddess dressing was heavenly and the rack of ribs was tasty as all get out! They offer up 3 types of sauce, house, mustard and a fiery jalapeno, I   tried each and all had their own goodness, but the jalapeno was my favorite.  Finished out this great meal with an amazingly delicious pecan cobbler ala mode that sent my taste buds into the stratosphere!",

My company home office is in Kansas City, I have been all over Texas, travel to Memphis a good bit, and Lexington is right up the road... so I have been to the best all these areas have to offer. Milwood is different than all of those in a really good way! Prob borrow a little from those regions, and the result is their own thing going on.   I will just say you can tell someone has smoked a LOT of meats to get it this right. Most other BBQ places has something over-powering going on.. Either the smoke, the rub, the bbq sauce, but here it is such a good mix. That's why I say someone has smoked a lot of meats because no one gets that lucky lol. The ribs and chicken I tried were both smoked perfectly. The BBQ slaw was the best I have ever had! I do my own sauce at home and I will say one of the hardest things to do is to get the sweet vs sour just right, but they do here! I just appreciate something done right and they do smoking right hereI will be back!   Curt",

I ordered the Burnt Ends with Mac N Cheese, hubby got a Pulled Pork sandwich and fries, kids got Grilled Cheese and Apples. I also got a container of Sweet Potatoes fries (I can't turn those away.). Everything was above par for a BBQ joint. Burnt Ends had a lot of sauce on them which made it a little underwhelming.  However,  the Mac n Cheese and Sweet Potatoes Fries made up for it. Grilled Cheese and regular fries were average. Hubby's Pulled Pork sandwich looked amazing. I didn't try it but it looked really tasty.   Only bummer was there's no drink specials on Saturdays. But a bottle of Johnny Appleseed was only $4! We would definitely go back at least for additional drink specials during the week. Plus I need to try the Pulled Pork Sandwich.",

    "text": "This adventure of Excited about Eating takes us to the Midwood area of Charlotte to Midwood Smokehouse. This restaurant is tucked into the edge of a building, but it's bigger than it looks.  A Friday lunch was a 10 minute wait, but it probably took that long to snag a parking spot. Although the restaurant was jammed, service was attentive and prompt.  For starters we ordered the Fried Pickles, unique, in that they were sliced length-wise. They were coated in a spicy batter, crispy like I prefer, but I would've enjoyed them more with half the salt.  Since we expected to eat a hefty dinner that night, we shared the BBQ combo which included four meats: pork ribs, sausage, brisket (lean, fatty, combo), and chopped pork. We chose mac and cheese and creamed corn for the two sides.  The combo plate came with three dipping sauces: Midwood Signature (sweet, with just a hint of tang) for the ribs and brisket, Eastern NC Vinegar for the chopped pork, and South Carolina (spicy) Mustard for the sausage. The ribs had a wonderful smoky flavor and fall-off-the-bone meaty goodness, the star of the meats. Dora here, the ribs were finger-licking great, but Ernie's home-smoked ribs are still better. :)  The sausage ranked second, mild with just the right amount of kick. I especially liked the dark bark in both the chopped pork and brisket. Ditto for Dora. And the corn had a firm consistency, not soft or mushy. The spiral pasta had a deep cheesy flavor, but it could've been a tad warmer for my liking.  I would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.",

I chose Midwood which was a good call.  Decor is Texas shabby-chic.  The place was packed from when I entered to when I left about 2 hours later.  Expect a wait unless you choose to sit at the bar, which I did.  But lets move on to the food.  Food is insane.  When I'm in a restaurant that clearly knows their stuff I'll just turn the keys over to my server/bartender and tell them to bring me the drink and meal of their choice.  This was a good call.  Melissa, the bartender took great care of me.  Everything from picking the best IPA in town to letting me sample their burnt ends.  Uniquely great service at an already great restaurant makes this the best BBQ place in CLT.  Brisket was incredible.  It doesn't come served with a slice of white bread like many BBQ buffs might be used to, but I can forgive that slight difference.  Sides were also amazing:  Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno's and Hush Puppies.  Geez... why am I not there right now?  I'm wasting my life...  Small disclaimer, milage may vary with different locations and different meals.  I went to the Ballantyne Midwood a few weeks later for lunch and ordered a pork sandwich and didn't find the meal that impressive.  I chalk this us largely to most BBQ is really about the pure meat, plain and simple and most attempts to dress them up never have the desired effect.  Go there, right now.",

Believe it or not, in spite of the fact that the BBQ is great, and we love BBQ, maybe our favorite thing on the menu is the Midwood chopped salad. We usually get it with grilled salmon and balsamic dressing, but seriously, it's so good without the protein that I almost always get it that way now. Go and enjoy!  And don't forget to ask for Tom!

This place has a bar area and a restaurant area, and we were seated in the restaurant.  Looks like there is an upstairs and patio too which I guess they open on weekends.  The place was about 3/4 full the whole time we were there.   BF and I shared the \"Pig Out\" combo platter ($31) where you can choose 4 meats.  We chose ribs, brisket, chicken, and chopped pork.  It comes with their infamous hushpuppies, and we chose mac n cheese, bacon wrapped jalapenos, and Texas toast as our sides.  It also came with 4 different BBQ sauces: South Carolina Mustard, Vinegar, Midwood Signature & Spicy Habanero.  I liked the spicy a lot actually, but it's not even spicy; it has just the right amount of kick.  Signature is the runner up, followed by the vinegar, and finally the mustard, which i didn't care for much.  The food itself was delicious although the chicken was kind of dry.  The sauces went with the meats well, and the Texas Toast was the cherry on top.  I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone whose looking for good Southern BBQ.",

We split a combination platter and got to try their pulled chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and the best ribs I've ever had with sides of creamed corn and delicious Mac and cheese and hush puppies. We tried all four of their BBQ sauces and they were all fantastic, and we topped off our meal with delicious banana pudding. We also had a great waitress while we were there for lunch. This is hands down our favorite barbecue restaurant in Charlotte and we will definitely be going back!",

Last night we had a great server- funny, efficient, and had some great ordering suggestions (plus, she knew the beer list so well!)- but the server at the table next to us should win some kind of medal. An older, disabled lady was dining alone and had a large number of take out boxes. Her server offered to help by taking the lady's boxes out to her car for her and met her at the door with the car keys. I was really moved. Nice job, Midwood Smokehouse!",

I went early, 5:00 PM on a Saturday after reading how packed it gets. Glad I did.  By the time I left a hour and change later it was jammed.

My friend and I got the sampler platter with ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket. I think we also got sides of Mac and cheese, collard greens and hush puppies. The collard greens were gross but it's also the first time I've tried collard greens so maybe I just don't like them period. Hush puppies were good and Mac and cheese was okay, a little under flavored. But let's talk BBQ! The ribs were by far the best. Next time I come it will definitely be for those. They were well seasoned and very tender. Other BBQ was pretty good. I'd probably say the pulled pork was next best then brisket then chicken. If you've never been before sampler is a nice way to go but if you just want some good food get the ribs!",

Very lean, very tasty. My wife got the brisket, which was excellent also. We also grabbed the bacon wrapped jalepeno's as a appetizer. These things are amazing. We had fried pickles also, which were good, but those Jalapeno's went first. I would say, at this point, the new standard for BBQ has been set.",

Sides were Carolina slaw and bacon wrapped jalepenos.  Everything was delish!  The jalepenos were AMAZING!!!  My favorite meat was probably the ribs, but the turkey was also great.  They also served the meat platter with 3 different sauce sides.  The classic BBQ was great.  Though my experience was great partly because of the excellent company, I have to say that the food was great, as well as the service.

As far as the food menu went, it was really, really hard to make a choice. Everything sounds and looks terrific. I went with the burnt ends with hush puppies and mac and cheese, which were all fantastic. My table also had a sampler platter, which included pulled pork, some sides, and some wings. My mother-in-law got a salad; I didn't try it, but she loved it.   I really don't think you can go wrong here. Now that I've tried the BBQ staples, I'm excited to try some of their more inventive options on the menu. There's a lot on the menu to explore, and I'm looking forward to the journey.",

Came here with my family to get an assortment of BBQ choices.   I recommend getting the large platter to share if you want a variety of meat.  I am a brisket kind of guy, so I say this brisket comes up to par with some of the best in Charlotte.  Although its no Texas brisket, i would say this comes just right under Texas' brisket.  Nonetheless, this place is worth trying out.    The larger patter comes with 2 sides and your choice of 4 meats.  I would suggest just trying all they have to offer.  The BBQ pulled pork and sausage is great.  The brisket is amazingly tender and soft.    If you're looking for an appetizer as you wait, i would get the wings.  These wings are pretty decently made with a unique flavor of BBQ.  It isn't your typical type of bbq wings, but its something you must try.  All together i probably spent $60 to feed a party of 6.  We came out stuffed.",

We were in the restaurant a few months back and expressed our disappointment to the manager, Kristin.  She was extremely nice, and took our feedback.  She also took our number and promised to let us know if the creamed corn was to be released again, even if only for a limited time.  Fast forward to today, months later, and imagine our surprise when we received a text message from Kristin letting us know that Midwood Smokehouse has added creamed corn back to the menu!!!  Regardless of the menu item being back, we were SHOCKED that this manager went out of her way to follow up with us and make sure we were happy, even months later.  You DO NOT see this kind of service anywhere and I can't believe she even remembered this encounter.  We immediately changed our plans for the evening and went in to Midwood for dinner.  Our food and service was great as usual, but the creamed corn was AMAZING.  It is back on the menu with a jalapeno twist and it was out of this world.  We will continue to go visit Midwood Smokehouse and I can't shout loud enough how cool it was to get that text message today... not only because I love the creamed corn, but because I appreciated her taking the time to do that so much.  Kristin deserves a RAISE!!  :)  Thanks so much!",

    "text": "WINNER!  Situated in the Plaza/Midwood neighborhood with a diverse staff and clientele. My husband got the smaller, 4-item combo platter (BBQ chicken, Carolina pork BBQ, brisket & ribs) with creamed corn & BBQ slaw. I got the Carolina BBQ with bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers. For dessert, we got the banana pudding (oh my yummy) & chocolate-chip bread pudding. The desserts were slow coming out & when the manager realized it, he comped both of them. The place was busy, people constantly arriving & leaving, but nobody waited more than a few minutes (we were sitting near the front door) and ample (& friendly) wait staff helped everything flow smoothly. They get 5 stars for sure. We'll be back for sure!!",

However, I'd been relatively disappointed in the BBQ I've had in Charlotte until I came to Midwood. We ordered the pulled pork, chicken, brisket, and burnt ends, collard greens, bacon wrapped jalapenos, and creamed corn. Everything was delicious! I'm a connoisseur of good brisket, and this did not disappoint. I'm excited to go back and try the ribs! Carry on Midwood; I'll be back soon!",

Our waitress and servers were attentive and efficient. They were terrific with the two small children in our group. The space is incredibly loud. You may want to sit outside if you want a quieter experience.  One member of party received a drink not to her liking and the staff made not only one but two attempts to get it right. They succeed in satisfying her requirements. The two appetizers we shared, jalapenos wrapped in bacon and barbecue chicken wings, were amazing. The combo platter of ribs, pulled pork, and beef was good, but not outstanding. Though the ribs were tasty. We thoroughly enjoyed the crispy sweet potato fries and crunchy hush puppies. I'd return when I visiting the area again.",

I am not a bbq expert like reviewers claiming they are super pro, I just like it frequently and I am really picky about how it tastes. Midwood serves just the right sauces with everything.  Sauce is basically my favorite part of the meal and these guys nail it. I love getting the hush puppies with the regular bbq sauce, or the thin vinegar nc style sauce with the pork.   And I don't see a lot of people mentioning this, but ... the bbq chicken with the SC style mustard sauce, is probably my #1 favorite. It's so tasty.  Also important: The staff have invariably been courteous and friendly to me, even when I show up 15 minutes before closing to please get a to go sandwitch. They never make me feel like it's the end of the night or anything, I get the same bright cheer I would at 7 pm.   And 1/2 price nc drafts on mondays is pretty much the best. basically this place is great.",

    "text": "Midwood Smokehouse is situated right in the heart of the Plaza-Midwood area surrounded by tons of great places to eat and yet it rises above the rest.  No easy feat.  For one, I had heard stories about this place prior to visiting, about how the food was so good that it was always crowded and you might have to wait to be seated.  Well the first time I went came here with a friend we did in fact end up having to wait about 15 minutes to be seated but I have to say those 15 minutes were very well worth it.  First off, the staff is amazing.  Always friendly and conversational, knowledgable of the menu, and happy to be there.    The shining star meal of the Midwood Smokehouse for me is the Burnt Ends BBQ plate.  These are little cubes of meat made with their in house Fat Tire sauce.  I was really blown away at how great these things tasted the first time I had them.  I ordered a small plate and regretted not getting a large.  Seriously they're that good.  On the side I also decided to try their bacon wrapped jalapeno side as a jalapeno wrapped in bacon was an odd combination that I had never heard of.  These were really good too.  I'll recommend grabbing a side of them with whatever meal you decide to get.  Overall I must say the food at Midwood Smokehouse is top-notch.  Midwood Smokehouse has a sizable menu of draft beers so we decided to have a few.  A good portion of their selection consists of local drafts from right here in NC so I went for the Mother Earth IPA out of my hometown and it was as good as expected.  I can't recommend Midwood Smokehouse enough. It's well worth the wait to get in and I see what all the fuss was about over this place.  Since first trying them in 2013 I've been back several times and it's always a great eating experience.  BBQ is big in the part of NC that I'm from and I have to say Midwood Smokehouse ranks among some of the best in the state.",

    "text": "(3.7/5) The brisket is a must. I don't care if you get it in a salad, between a grilled cheese, as a side, or on a plate like how I did. It's tender, delicious, and slow-cooked to perfection. I ordered the beef brisket plate (both lean and fatty) with hush puppies, pickled onions, and bacon-wrapped jalapenos as a side. Unfortunately, most of the accompaniments besides the pickled onions were mediocre, not amazing. Do not get the mac and cheese--my friend got it and I tasted it. It was grainy like dry finely grated cheese and not very saucy.   Service was great. He regularly checked up on us and had great energy. We didn't have a wait long for a large group dinner at 7pm on a weekday. Compared to Mac's Speed Shop, I definitely prefer Mac's for an overall dining experience (sides were better, servings were larger, wait was much longer too) but like I said, the brisket here definitely deserves a try.",

    "text": "An understated outpost of 'cue on Central Ave., Midwood lacks many of the typical sign posts I look for when in search of great barbecue (i.e. storefront art featuring chef's hat and apron clad pigs gleefully cooking bacon).  If you look closely enough, you'll notice that the pig on the sign is smiling.  Once inside however, you instantly know you're on to something.  The bustling dining room offers tightly packed tables with plenty of seating, but I opted for a seat at the bar which offers a little more elbow room.  The stout bar stools offer support should you imbibe too much brew, or be overcome by \"the itis.\"  I can only speak for the pulled pork, which is served up Eastern style, and the mac 'n cheese--both are delicious.  You'll need access to a roll of paper towels for this one. I've mentally booked a return trip intended to sample the beef brisket.  So deep in pork country?! I know, it sounds crazy, but it says a lot about how much these people know what they're doing with that namesake smoker.",

We had burnt ends and pulled chicken with very crispy sweet potato fries. It was delicious!!! The mustard sauce that came with the chicken was tasty and different. BBQ sauce that was brought to the table was perfection. Coleslaw was a nice way to cool some of the spicy food down. Our ice teas with firefly vodka were spot on! Our waiter, dark brown beard and hair, was very informative about the menu and town. Service was great! Definitely returning to eat here next time in town.",

Their side items such as baked beans and mac and cheese are pretty typical so I made my own very easily. So if your looking to host a big BBQ they will hook you up with some good BBQ.

I asked the bartender for a recommendation. Her favorite was a BeeSting. I thought I may have to wrestle my wife for it. I am happy to do that.  Really good! We ordered the sampler plate. (The smaller one) we both ate from it and have healthy portions to bring home. Highlights were the pork, brisket , ribs , mac & cheese & collard greens. Wait ... Thats everything.

Mac n cheese is mediocre and the smoked vegetables are not that great.  Best meat here is the ribs, which can come with either dry rub or wet sauce.  I usually get the dry rubbed ribs and dip them in BBQ sauce separately.  The burnt ends were average.  The pulled pork was OK, nothing special.    I did come here once on a Tuesday at ~7PM and they were out of ribs, but that has only happened once.  Beer selection is decent and prices are good.  Overall a good eat and you know what you are going to get. I'll be back.",

The wing are fantastic, and the pork BBQ tender and delicious, made even better with their collection of sauces.  This place is legit.

I did a quick yelp search and decided to head over and pick up food for all of the helpers!   Came in and placed a large to-go order consisting mostly of pulled pork sandwiches, which everyone enjoyed. The best part was all of the different sides! I think that we were able to try most of the options but the stars were the mac-n-cheese, the bacon wrapped jalapenos and the potato salad. It was even super delicious the following day when we reheated the leftovers!!  I do have to give a special thanks to the bartender who went through the bag to verify all of our food was included before we left. Had he not we would have been one sandwich short and that would not have been good! So, thanks for being so thorough!   Fast forward 2 weeks, the house is all unpacked and my husband and I are craving the BBQ again. This time we decided to actually eat in. The service was top notch and the food amazing. I stuck with the pulled pork and the husband went with the special which was a brisket taco with spicy slaw (SO GOOD!!!). We were both really happy with our choices and left full, with to go cups for our iced teas. I always think this is nice, especially after a big meal like BBQ!   I will def be returning and even as I'm writing this review, I'm wondering if I will be able to convince the hubs to go tonight!",

Our waitress didn't show up until about 15 minutes in, then it took forever for her to bring the food (despite the fact the table of 4 next to us ordered from her about 10 seconds before we did, we didn't get ours (a table of 2) until a good 10 minutes after them). She even said she saw it, but then didn't bring it for another 5 minutes. Before we had gotten our entree she came by and asked if we'd like any desert. Totally clueless.  Now the food. It was just ok. They got the order wrong and messed up the sauces completely. We both had the pulled pork, but neither was very pulled, more like chunked. I shouldn't need a knife to eat pulled pork, but I certainly did. It was also extremely fatty. I had huge pieces of fat and gristle. It was also way oversalted, and this is from two people who like their salt. The fried pickles were just ok, we've had better. They were too soggy. The jalapeno bacon poppers were good, but not outrageous as I was led to believe. The texture was a bit off, and the bacon wasn't crispy. The potato salad was good, as were the hushpuppies. The smoked vegetables were a bit soggy as well, not crispy as you'd expect, but they were ok.  We won't be going back.",

Attentive and so polite, I never felt hovered over or uncomfortable. He was genuinely happy to help.  We had pulled pork nachos, pulled chicken sandwich with slaw and hushpuppies, and a chicken bacon sandwich. I could have eaten it all with my eyes alone. So glad to have used my mouth instead!   Hushpuppies were hot and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. We had freshly cooked tortilla chips with that DELICIOUS dip of nacho sauce and tender pulled pork. The slaw and mustard sauce that came with my sandwich were seriously good enough to eat on their own.   I will ABSOLUTELY come back with my friends and family when they visit. The service and choice of drink specials kept me intrigued enough to do so. Thanks so much to the hostess and Paul today!",

Both times, the food was as good as what comes out of my kitchen and I didn't have to cook it so I suppose that makes me happy. The service was ok; the waitress was friendly and got everything right but it was a long time between table visits even when bringing condiments; I think they must have been short-handed. Bacon wrapped jalapenos were quite tasty but some were waaaay hotter than others. It was like 3 were poblano and two were real jalapenos seeds included. (I like it hot!) The turkey (special of the day) was nothing to write home about but it was definitely something I'd put on a sandwich for lunch the next day.

My favorite things to order are... - BBQ Queso (app) - Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos (app or side) - Classic Mac & Cheese (side) - Dry Rubbed Ribs (entree) - Well Fed Combo Platter (entree for 2) - Stockyard taco (entree)  The restaurant itself can get a little crowded.  Go early to avoid a long wait.  Outdoor seating (on a covered and climate-controlled patio) is available and is what I prefer.  Parking can be a little cumbersome.  The original restaurant is in Plaza Midwood.  They have since expanded to Ballantyne and have plans to expand in Park Rd. Shopping Center.",

    "text": "One of us had a taste for some BBQ, so on my monthly lunch trip with my lunch buddies, it was decided this was the place.   I'd really like to give this place 5 stars but something was lacking. Don't get me wrong; food, service, ambiance, and drinks were on point. Maybe it was the portion size or the ratio of meat to bread, or the skinny crinkled cut fries.  I had the Grilled Cheese with brisket with crinkled cut fries and Kentucky Slush Puppy.  Kentucky Slush Puppy was on point. Not too sweet, refreshing, and not a lot of alcohol. (Amaretto Sour is my favorite drink if that tells you anything)  The Grilled Cheese w/ Brisket was good. I guess my one problem is there was more bread than anything. Also I was expecting meat, cheese, and onions to be pouring out of my sandwich. I like a mess when it comes to BBQ... and leftovers. I mean this is the south... Bring on the large sandwich and overwhelmingly large portion of fries. Let me decide when enough is enough.   All in all... It was good. Perhaps, I made the mistake of comparing this place to BBQ's. ill give it another try.",

For dessert, the banana pudding is a good option.   Overall, always a good choice for barbeque.",

    "text": "Gotta say, Midwood Smokehouse was pretty tasty--coming from a girl raised on Memphis style BBQ.  Everything was delicious.  I had the pulled pork plate, an utterly huge portion for a reasonable price (choice of meat, two sides, and hush puppies). The fries were lightly spicy and cut very thin, fried to a perfect crisp.  I enjoyed my one hush puppy.  It had a slight kick and was nice and crunchy with a rich cornmeal flavor.  The best part was definitely the Mac and cheese.  The noodles were soft and cooked perfectly and the cheese struck the perfect balance between gooey parts and semi-solid parts.  The BBQ itself almost paled in comparison to the sides, but it was quite good with a nice smoky flavor.  I will say that I preferred the more southern style sweet sauce than the vinegar based sauce, and I wish the pork had been a little more moist without having to add sauce.  The only disappointment at Midwood was the banana pudding, which I felt had too much whipped cream and not enough bananas, vanilla wafers, or, well, pudding.   The decor is super cute--we now sometimes play trivia at home with the name \"Praise the Lard\"--and the service was good.  Midwood is worth a visit for sure!",

Well, Midwood Smokehouse is our go-to choice for meeting any barbecue hankerings. Plus, you get some of the local flavor from the surrounding Plaza Midwood neighborhood. Kill two family visit birds with one stone!  In terms of food, I've sampled a little bit of everything from the menu at this point, but the Cuban sandwich is usually what ends up calling my name. It's a solid choice with some of the chopped smoked pork for that barbecue taste .The local beer selection is on point, and has just enough offerings without overwhelming. I also appreciate that they do have regular drink specials.",

We waited for about 35-40min on a Saturday night. This place is a very busy place and loud on the inside. Our server told us that their popular dishes are the Carolina pulled pork and beef brisket. He emphasized that the burnt ends entree is one of their best sellers. With that being said, I opted to try it. I started out with their chopped salad as my appetizer. Easily one of the best salads I'd ever had. Very simple but loaded with flavor. Get the green goddess dressing on it. The salad has chopped cucumber, black beans, corn etc in it and it's topped with fresh avocado. My entree was ok. The burnt ends were salty to me and the flavor of \"charred\" ends was overwhelming. I would get their regular beef brisket next time, as I am sure it is delicious. My sides were wonderful. I had their smoked vegetables and collard greens! Their hush puppies were really good! Despite my experience with the burnt ends, I think this establishment offers wonderful BBQ food, if you want some good ole southern BBQ! I would definitely return.",

First of all, they all loved the food and thanked us incessantly.   We purchased the grilled chicken, roasted summer vegetables, potato salad, and banana pudding. Everythinng was excellent! The chicken was really moist and had a rich smoky flavor. The veggies were fresh and crunchy. The potato salad was creamy and tasted like they had just made it. The banana pudding may have been the best one I have ever tried. I am guessing they make it with condensed milk and cream cheese and fold in the whipped cream to give it that airy feeling.   We also ordered regular and sweet tea. They brought us sliced lemons which was a lovely touch. They also provided serving utensils and flatware.   I will definitely be visiting in person. I also want to comment on the wonderful presentation that the caterer gave us. It looked very nice for a professional event. Also, the ease of the ordering was appreciated as well as the reasonable prices. Thanks Midwood!",

Very generous amount for an appetizer, 2 of us could not finish them. The cheese was good but it was on the more tame/bland side of pimento. I would order again! 2. I got the hot mess burger. This is a burger made with ground brisket and chuck I believe, and the waitress suggested I order it rare/medium-rare. While I will eat a steak that way, I am not as trusting when it comes to ground beef. I ordered the burger medium and it came well done. Luckily the delicious bacon-y  cheese-y condiment and the jalapeno poppers on the burger made it so tasty and juicy that the meat being a bit dry didn't bother me. If you are all about the meat, I would check the doneness before the waitress leaves. I ate the entire thing, and the collards were delicious.  3. Hubs got the large brisket plate, and he ordered the brisket \"fatty\". I will say, my husband is a barbeque snob. He smokes his own meats and spends ridiculous amounts of time researching barbeque. The brisket was dry for him...especially since he ordered it fatty. He said the sauce and the flavor were good, but it seemed to be rushed due to trying to serve customers. He also remarked that the mac and cheese was some of the best he has ever had.   So..all in all, we had some meat issues BUT we would definitely go back and try again. All the sides and the app were fantastic. The burger was still delicious even though it was well done.",

We came on a Sunday afternoon and sat out on the porch, thoroughly enjoying the laid back atmosphere and beautiful weather.  Our order included a Bloody Mary ($3 off that day), a Combo platter with the chopped pork, beef brisket, St. Louis ribs, and smoked sausage and sides of mac and cheese and bacon wrapped jalapenos. We also added a side of burnt ends. My favourite meat would have to be the beef brisket - it was the perfect balance of lean and fatty meat. Pair that with Midwood's signature bbq sauce and you're solid. The ribs were also very tender. Although the burnt ends were packed with flavour, the meat was a bit tough for me since it was fully cooked through.  Aside from enjoying all the meats, I thought the sides were alright. I would have preferred a runnier consistency for the mac and cheese, and I am just not too fond of bacon in general.  I would highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "A couple of weeks ago, I heard rumor of a new BBQ joint opening up in Charlotte.  As I read more and more about it, I started getting excited and determined that I just had to check this new place out soon.  Well that new place is Midwood Smokehouse, and I took the opportunity today to check it out before having to head in to the office.  Nestled in the Plaza-Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte, NC, Midwood Smokehouse is the newest restaurant opened by longtime Charlotte restauranteur Frank Scibelli.  Scibelli is the brain child behind several popular Charlotte restaurants such as Big Daddy's Burger Bar and Paco's Tacos and Tequila.  As noted in an interview with Charlotte Magazine, Scibelli's restaurant fully intends to produce serious, authentic wood-smoked BBQ.  To accomplish this goal, he traveled around North Carolina to research the state's well-known pork barbecue joints, and he also collaborated with James Beard award winner Robb Walsh on the intricacies of Texas barbecue (read: brisket).  My task for today was to see how close he came to meeting this goal.  While the location of the restaurant may be in a trendy part of the city, the interior decor was inviting.  A mirror behind the bar stated the daily specials as well as some rather interesting one-liners/  Since Midwood Smokehouse has been open for less than two weeks, the menu was a little limited.  However, plenty of options were still available, ranging from Eastern Carolina style pork to brisket to sausage made on the premises.  After perusing the menu, I ordered a half-rack of ribs (St. Louis style) with a side of BBQ baked beans.  I requested that the ribs be sauced.  In addition, I ordered an additional side of bacon-wrapped jalapenos stuffed with cheese (which I lovingly refer to as ABTs, or atomic buffalo turds).  The server was very pleasant, taking her time to go through several of the menu options and offer her personal recommendations.  After about 10 minutes, my order arrived.  The first thing I notice is that the ribs were served with sauce on the side instead of being glazed on the ribs (as I expected).  The food certainly looked appetizing, and I will get to my thoughts on the food shortly.  As I was taking pictures of my food, the general manager came over to my table.  I introduced myself to him as a BBQ blogger, and he immediately offered to bring me a sampling of their other menu items.  How could I possibly refuse?  As if I wasn't already starting to feel full enough, out comes a sampling of pork, brisket, prime rib, sausage, and other goodies.  In addition, I also got to sample all of the sauces that Midwood Smokehouse offers as well as a small sample of collard greens.  Now on to the verdict...  The ribs had an excellent flavor. The meat was not too smoky, and I could actually taste the pork rather than an overabundance of rub to mask the flavor of the meat.  However, there were two things I immediately noticed:  - The back membrane had been left on the rack when it was cooked. - The rib meat pulled right off the bone without any resistance, which signified that they were a bit overcooked.  The sausage was a very mild sausage.  It had a bit of a crumbly texture.  Since I'm not an expert on how authentic Texas-style sausage should taste, I won't give an opinion on that.  The brisket was good, with a nice texture and taste.    The pork was, in short, PERFECT!  It had a perfect savory flavor, and the texture was on point (and not mushy like a lot of Eastern Carolina style pork can be).  Honestly, the pork did not need any sauce, but I decided to try it with the vinegar-based sauce.  The sauce added an extra dimension to the pork.  Finally, the prime rib...  why didn't someone introduce me to smoked prime rib before?  Completely and totally droolworthy!  This one is definitely on my repeat list.  So would I recommend this BBQ joint?  Absolutely, with no reservations whatsoever!

Fairly crowded (so you know it's good) on a weekday for lunch, but not too crowded for a long wait - check.  Parking adequate - check.  Eyes bigger than my stomach - check.  What's not to like?  Pimento cheese fries.  Bacon wrapped jalepenos.  Huge salads you can fix up with BBQ chicken/pork/etc.  I still love Mac's Speed Shop, as well, but Midwood Smokehouse provides an alternative closer to Dilworth (location of my employer).  I'm not sure a city can have too much high-end BBQ.  Not only is it in the rotation, I'm putting it near the top.",

My wife and I went on our first date here, it's the first restaurant I bring family/friends to when visiting, and it's the first words out of my mouth when somebody asks where to go for BBQ.    I always get the giant platter with a nice portion of everything on it.  I kid you not I can usually feed a couple of people with the leftovers.  The Brisket and the ribs are the stars of the show but everything else is fantastic as well.  The sides are great and I don't think I can ever get my fill of bacon wrapped jalapenos and hushpuppies. Thinking of the warm evenings I've spent eating in the outdoor section with a bourbon, giant plate of bbq, watching the sun go down is keeping me warm this winter! Are you still reading this?  Get your butt over to midwood!",

    "text": "I stopped in for lunch at Midwood Smokehouse and was delighted to grab a table outside. A beautiful day and a much-hyped BBQ shop had the makings of a great meal. I've been searching for a great BBQ shop. I went into the meal hoping I had found a great local BBQ shop.  I ordered a Small Pulled Pork Plate and was delighted when the meal came out in no more than 3 minutes. Love that.  The very friendly and attentive waitress claimed that the meal was 8oz of meat and the menu also claimed that the pork was PULLED. I must have done a poor job of hiding my confusion when the meal was delivered because the waitress asked if everything was ok. I pointed out the obvious fact that the pork was chopped and not pulled. Apparently, they pull the pork apart...and then chop it. In my book, that's called chopped. Chopped and Pulled are two different meals. I won't be convinced otherwise and I won't be fooled.   I suspect that there wasn't quite 8oz of meat, but forgot my digital scale.  Putting the texture discrepancy aside, the BBQ was seasoned very well. I'm a fan of a sweeter BBQ and tend to shy away from vinegar-based sauces. The BBQ was seasoned so well that the side of vinegar sauce was unnecessary. The side of baked beans had great texture and were seasoned to perfection(sweet), but was a small side. Mixing the BBQ and the beans together, I found my sweet flavorful BBQ.   I was unimpressed with the hush-puppies but my four-legged companion liked them. I'm sure she would give them two-paws up. She likes hush-puppies but I've never had one I really liked.   Overall, the food was pretty good but I have to admit I was disappointed at the prices. The portions were small for the amount of money. The small plate was in the range of $9 and only came with one side. I couldn't justify to my self spending $3 to get an extra side. After seeing the size of the sides, I made the right choice.   Midwood Smokehouse is a good concept and has the makings of a great BBQ joint, but they've really missed it on portion size.",

    "text": "Doesn't compare to Mac's Speed Shop.  My first visit went well, a lazy Sunday afternoon with a couple buddies when they weren't too busy.  The menu looks really good but the pulled pork I ordered didn't stand up to Mac's.  My buddy liked it better than Mac's, but I think he's biased since he lives 2 miles from Midwood Smokehouse (to be honest, I live 2 miles away from Mac's).  My second visit was a complete disaster.  Originally planned to go to Mac's this past Friday (Jun 24) with 5 out-of-town buddies plus 2 others, and got talked into changing to Midwood Smokehouse (same buddy as above).    While their menu states they may run out of bbq from time to time (never seen a restaurant advertise running out of food before, but whatever), they were out of pulled pork bbq on Friday night at 8:00, and also out of bacon wrapped jalepenos (gotta love the south, they wrap everything in bacon).  I ordered a rack of ribs to compare to Mac's and they tasted like they were cooked in the oven as they had zero smoke flavor.  The bbq sauce didn't help at all, too bland.  The waiter hooked us up with wings since they were out of pork bbq and the wings were supposedly smoked but had zero flavor.  No rub, no sauce, no nothin.  The mac & cheese however was very good (close to Mac's).  I tried my buddy's sausage and it was dry and tasted like cardboard.  Midwood Smokehouse has been open for only 2 months, hopefully they step up their game!",

Their BBQ gives Charlotte a reason to be famous for BBQ! Start with the pimento cheese fries topped with beef brisket and thank me later. I am a huge fan of the Midwood Chopped salad topped with chopped pork. It is an incredibly satisfying, flavorful, enormous salad full of veggies, avocado, and deliciously flavorful BBQ. Their BBQ chicken is delicious, but you can't go wrong with the pork or brisket. Both are flavored and cooked perfectly every time. Their smoked veggies side is absolutely delicious and a great pairing with any of their BBQ dishes (especially if you're looking to add at least a bit more nutritional value to your meal). And, if you're up for dessert, their banana pudding is among the best I've ever tasted. The small size is plenty big, and the large size is truly LARGE. Definitely enough to share - or not, if you don't feel like sharing! They also have plenty of beer, wine, and cocktails available.",

    "text": "When I see a new restaurant open, I usually like to wait a few months to let them work out the kinks before I give it a try.  But pork bbq makes me all weak in the knees, so after driving by a few times I decided I had to give in to see if it was worth drooling all over my steering wheel all week long.  Holy crap.  It SO was.  I went on a Friday with a few friends.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with baked beans, and we got an order of hush puppies for the table.  I opted for the vinegar sauce.  The pork was tender and smoky, the vinegar sauce was just a little spicy, and the baked beans had bacon (!)  in them.   The hush puppies were just the right kind of fried - crispy but not greasy, and were perfectly balanced between sweet and savory.   For dessert I had banana pudding that made me lick the bowl and my hubby had some kind of cookie/peanut-butter cup concoction that was also fabulous.  Oh, and the service was warm and friendly and we never had to wait on drink refills.  We had such a good time that we went back.  The next night.  This is a little embarrassing for me, admitting that I gorged myself on bbq two nights in a row and didn't regret it for a second (until Sunday morning).  But I think it speaks to the deliciousness of the food.  Also, the next night someone ordered the brown-sugared bacon as their side, and I feel I should warn you not to eat it, ever, because if you do you won't want to stop.  If they diced that stuff up and mixed it into some vanilla ice cream I would leave my husband for it.  I'm not even kidding.  I would leave my husband and declare brown-sugared bacon ice cream my one True love.  (Do you hear me, Smokehouse?)  Midwood needed a place like this, and I'm so happy to welcome it to the neighborhood.  Anybody have any plans for dinner?  I have this sudden craving for bbq.",

We were a party of 9 and they told us it would be about 1 hour wait.  We decided to wait and about 15-20 mintues later my sister went up there and god knows what she said to them but we were seated right away.  To start of the smell of the BBQ was absolutely mouth watering.    Once we ordered and waited about 10 mintues then the waitress comes out to say they ran out of ribs.  HUH??? but ok, we decided to go with the saugage and brisket. Then we asked them for a complimentary appetizer to make up for running out of ribs.  Guess what?? They all of a sudden had ribs left, so we ended up getting what we originally ordered.  Now to the food part.  The ribs and brisket were very tender, tasty and of good quality.  Definitely better than alot of other restaurants.  The baked beans we didn't care for.  They are very reasonably priced, actually cheaper than I expected.  For the 9 of us the bill came to $110.00  For the food 4 stars, price 5 stars and  the service, hhmm 3.  I would definitely try them again.",

Being from Portland, food is a big deal to both my fiance and I...a dealbreaker when considering moving.  My close friends in town suggested this place and we all went.  My fiance is a big BBQ guy and he loved what he had.  It was flavorful, moist and just enough food.  I loved all of the sides too.  We had great service at the bar and then sat outside under the covered patio.  We only had to wait a few minutes for a table, even on what seemed to be a busy night.  This made the (very long) list of restaurants that convinced us that we'd be able to survive in Charlotte.  We'll see you in July Queen City!",

    "text": "We are from Gastonia and actually love trying BBQ joint we haven't tried before.  I actually enlisted Yelp for us to pick our next one.  Midwood Smokehouse's reviews looked very interesting and promising so we went on a Monday for lunch since my husband was enjoying a long weekend.  The first thing that hits you is the smell of the meat smoking.  This is always a promising sign!  The waiter was very friendly and since I told him I was a newbie, he really tried to make our experience pleasurable.  We decided to just go for the entree but I know I want to try the jalapenos wrapped in bacon as an appetizer next time!  We ordered the well-fed Pig.  You get to choose four meats and two sides.  We chose Chopped BBQ (you get 4 oz. so I asked if I could get double BBQ and count as two choices) and he said, yes, Beef brisket (1/2 lean and 1/2 fatty), and ribs (you get 4).  I found out with the Well fed pig you get 4 oz. of meat each and with the Pig Out (you get 6 oz. of each choice).  Our sides we chose were mac & cheese and coleslaw.    First, to comment on the meat,  I am an Eastern-style chopped bbq kind of girl.  I just loved it.  The meat is pulled, not minced, like I love!  Very smoky, it comes without sauce, has nice pink ring.  You have a choice of 4 different sauces, SC mustard style, vinegar Eastern style which I used, of course, spicy bbq tomato based, and their original.  I thought it was really good and ranks up there with some of the best bbq, I have had in a long time.  The ribs were good, and although I haven't had a lot of brisket in my day, it was very good.  I will definitely be getting some more of that next time!   For the sides, the mac & cheese, I thought was delicious.  I know everyone's experience is different and so are their taste. However, I have to disagree with one of the other comments that I have read. The writer thought it tasted like a cafeteria mac & cheese.  I really have to disagree.  I found out Midwood makes it homemade everyday and it was great!  Can't wait to have that again, for sure.  Now, for the coleslaw, it is mayo-based which is how I like mine.  It is very finely chopped and for me, it just isn't my preference but it was tasty.  I would probably order a different side next time but hey, the mac & cheese is definitely a keeper.  I will have to say, for me & my hubby, we are definitely going back and probably on the weekend, so we can experience a crowd.  They have a long bar some and some good local beer on tap. Oh, on Monday's 1/2 priced local NC drafts.  I got the Highland Gaelic Ale, yummy!  It went great with the bbq.  We would definitely recommend for people to try this place and hope you have a great experience like we did!",

    "text": "While visiting family in the area for the Holidays , my cousin wanted me to try this place after both had seen it on the TV. We stopped in on a Saturday about 10:15pm  knowing they closed at 1100pm  I had the burnt ends with added sausage and started off with Bacon wrap jalapeno's.   Thought I'd loose my mind - AMAZING and the great service only added to the \" Hell yes I'll be back\" experience. BUT BUT BUT!!!!!  The very next night while my cousin was working, his wife and I made a return visit....................................It was like we went to a completely different place. This time, we did take out.  To start.............. Way to many things went wrong to list---  1) Cold. 2) Order wrong.  3) Portions seemed smaller VS night before.  4) BIG TIME ATTITUDE AND ARGUMENTATIVE DEFENSIVE POSITION FROM ROBERT.when i tried to explain. He made me feel as though I was trying to scam or just lying.  Robert even commented how angry I was - So I had to explain the difference between anger VS stern clear communication.  It was the interaction with Robert and a female staff that I initially interacted with-both was so \" That isn't possible.\" regarding my feedback.   When speaking to any owner/manager about my experience I try not to bring it up, but I trained in the culinary arts in LA and Italy; I know a little something about what I'm talking about.  Robert's attitude was less than warm and \"I'll  fix it by\" ..Didn't seem like an option for him. His comment to me was  \"What do you want me to do?\"  He was kind enough to take off the charge for a sandwich that had cheese on it WHEN IT WAS NO CHEESE request, the person eating it or suppose to eat it hates cheese.  I still have yet to see if that was done on my card.  Bottom line........... I hope the experience that Saturday night is the norm and Roberts accusative manner isn't.   I didn't come there for Robert.... But Robert is the reason I may not come back.  Take this as positive feedback, for that is the intent.   The food we got Sunday night was horrible - what should of happen was a total refund.  ( For me -- it wasn't about the money)",

I have never sat down and ate so can't comment on the service but for $20 I get a pound of BBQ and a large side of Mac N Cheese. I have always been impressed and the food is consistently great. They offer 2 different BBQ sauces and typical Eastern NC Vinegar and a more sweet and tangy sauce. My favorite is the sweet and tangy. Mac N Cheese is also delicious as well. I am very particular about restaurant Mac but you won't be disappointed.   As I said earlier I have never sat down inside the restaurant and ate but they are always packed when I go to pick up and it's in the Plaza/Midwood area which is quite trendy. I would recommend this place to all BBQ connoisseurs and those looking for a fun night out.",

    "text": "So me and KB the largest leprechaun were in Charlotte this week and we wanted to hit up an authentic barbecue joint to find out what this North Carolina barbecue was all about.  we decided on Midwood largely because to get four stars across 290 reviews with yelp is an accomplishment.  For me it's all about the food yeah the ambience is really nice and when I arrived I was pleased to find the corrugated sign out front with the flying pig I mean how bad can it be.  We started our meal with the stuffed jalapeno wrapped in bacon and as far as they were concerned definitely very spicy very moist very cheesy and the bacon was crispy so I'll put those at the top of the list is the best jalapeno I ever had.  Both KB The largest leprechaun and I ordered the combo plate.  I opted for the brisket smoked sausage chicken and St. Louis ribs.  I decided to order the ribs dry because if I wanted them wet i could always add sauce.   For my size I ordered the coleslaw and the mac & cheese.    I like to start with the good stuff so let's just say it was the best mac & cheese I've ever had. The brisket was moist and the ribs were above average.   The smoke sausage was sausage it's pretty much always going to be good.   I could tell KB liked cause he ate everything on his plate and it was Eyeing some of my plate as well.  My minor complaints where the pulled chicken I think they include too much of the white meat and/or if it happens to be yesterday's chicken.   I would just skip it.  And I'm not used to the way they serve cole slaw in the south it looked like it was put in a food processor just not my thing.    The beer selection is nice.  And the service was very good.  Only mix up with what type of dessert we wanted we ordered the bread pudding were served the banana pudding I think the waiter was hungry and really wanted the banana pudding. It was very good. The reason we don't get five stars because even though there was some serious highlights the jalapeno poppers and the mac & cheese the barbecue was very good but not the best ever.",

    "text": "Great 'Cue + Ambiance + Killer Service = Feeling REAAAL Good. (Bloated, but real good bloated!)  After spending 3 years living in the Kansas City, eating some of the BEST BBQ in the country, it's pretty hard to stack up to a Gates or Jack Stack's (5 Stars IMO) but the service and ambiance really bump this place up to 5 stars for me.   My husband and I went here for lunch on a Saturday, when it was packed. Even so, we were seated quickly, and had our unsweetened iced teas on the table within 2 minutes.  Our server gave us some recommendations-- but I would have liked if she \"sold\" some of her favorites better.  (The chicken salad is good...the chili is our special of the day...I like the mustard sauce.)   What our server did do, was offer us options.  My husband wanted a pork and brisket sandwich, but since it wasn't on the menu, our server said he could get the brisket, and add a $3 side of pulled pork, and she'd give us a buttered bun.    Our server recommended the chicken salad so I got that on lettuce leaves, roasted corn, tomatoes, red onion, cheese and orange honey mustard on the side.  The chicken salad is good, no doubt, but didn't have the smoky flavor I was hoping for.  If this wasn't at a BBQ joint, it would be A+.   When our server learned we were 1st timers, she brought us samples of each of the house sauces.  A mustard based one (sweet and thick, really nice), a hot and spicy tomato-based, a regular tomato-base and a Carolina vinegar based.) Alongside were 4 hushpuppies for dipping.  We appreciated this and were able to decide which one we wanted with our meats.   The real star...  Frank, the owner came over to us, and we started chatting.  When he learned we were first timers at his restaurant, and that we were from KC, immediately offered to bring us two of his ribs to try.  He explained how he smokes his meats everyday, (unlike Mac's Speedshop, where the meat is smoked somewhere else and then brought in...I was not surprised) and only used hickory wood to smoke.    The ribs were tender and fell off the bone.  The outside is extra seasoned and some would say salty, but to me, it was perfect.  All that spice and salt permeated the outside and helped seal in the juices of the meat.  Tender, moist...didn't need sauce.   My macaroni and cheese side was good-- as were the sweet potato fries.   The BRISKET was unreal.  You can pick lean, fatty, or both, and I recommend getting the \"both\" option. Tender, juicy, nice browned bits from the outside. LOVE.   Note: They have crushed ice here-- bonus!  $2 small banana pudding super creamy-- wafer cookies IN the pudding and on top.  NOT YELLOW. Delish.   Overall, the casual, but rich, warm interior and mirrored bar area really made us feel welcome.  Nice patio area too. Lots of drink specials daily.   Looking forward to going back!",

    "text": "The reviews for this place sounded so good and I did not realize where it was until the other night.  Right across the street from the Family Dollar Store where Bistro Le Bon is.  Today for lunch - (I did not eat it all).  The small Combo platter was: Chopped Pork, St. Louis Style Ribs, Sausage, Beef Brisket, Hush Puppies, Pickled Onions and two sides - I chose the Jalapenos stuffed with Cheese, wrapped with bacon and BBQ Slaw.  In addition I ordered: Fried Pickles, Sweet Potato Fries, Brown Sugar Bacon (only two slices) and for Dessert the Peanut Butter Cup (a minimum of 700 calories a meal in itself)!  One at a time:  Two very excellent BBQ sauces, One sweeter Tomato Based 4.5 yelp stars.  The second a vinegar based sauce 4.85 stars.  The Meats: NICE Smokey Flavor!!! The Beef Brisket (I needed a knife and not a sharp one and only barely - this brisket was Tender)! Good flavor on its own!  With the vinegar very good 4 stars.  St. Louis Cut Ribs 4.25 yelp stars.  The Sausage was better than many and better than most I've had lately 3.25 stars.  The Chopped Pork  Fantastic 5 stars.  The Brown Sugar Bacon 3.75 stars.  Extras:  The Fried Pickles are a Winner!!!  Thin sliced perfect batter (light and Thin) perfectly cooked an Easy 5 yelp stars and I ate these with no dressing!  They needed nothing the flavor was perfect!  Sweet Potato Fries another winner 5 yelp stars with ease.  The BBQ slaw was good, no mayo, very simple, I added the vinegar BBQ sauce to it so it rates a 3.95 stars.  Stuffed Jalapenos wrapped in Bacon 3.85 stars.  The Hush Puppies and Pickled Onions were throw away items (throw them away!) and NOT factored in to my review rating and that is a good thing for the restaurant!  The Dessert was good (I ate the whole thing) though I would not order it again because I'm very picky - This Dessert will not make my \"Dessert\" list at 3.6 stars!  Yes I took photos!  Happy Dinning!  The Roof Top dinning area looks real cool so I'll be back for the Cuban Sandwich and see how it stacks up with Carlos Cafe.",

I tried a few BBQ places down here and they were all great, but somehow Midwood Smokehouse managed to separate itself.  Here is why: Fatty Brisket.....It sounds odd (or maybe it doesn't if you are from the South), but it was awesome.  It melted in your mouth. Everything else was good, but this was the All-Star.  Service was great, too.  Only downside is that the restaurant is a little bit cramped, so it fills up quickly.",

We found Midwood Smokehouse on Yelp and decided to give it a try. And I'm glad we did! I got the Carolina BBQ with a side of hush puppies and collard greens. It was well-seasoned, perfectly cooked, and the hush puppies reminded me of corn bread, which I love. The portions are super generous and I'm sad that we had a plane to catch and I couldn't take leftovers :(",

    "text": "We are barbecue lovers but only eat it occasionally out of respect for healthy choices. The reviews on this restaurant looked inspiring, so with no other recommendations than Yelp and on a whim, here we come! It was very crowded, which is always a good sign, we check in and are told it is a 15-30 min wait. Not bad for a weekend in Charlotte. We are asked for a phone number so they can text when our table is ready. We wait, and we wait, and we wait. Parties come and are seated and after a reasonable time, we approach the hostess... OH she says, somehow the communication with our phone number didn't work but we can be seated immediately! In honor of the World Series, Strike One! Server eventually gets to us, we communicate the mixup about being seated and how ravenous we are, and order everything (drinks and food) immediately. She put a rush on it - it all comes out within 5 minutes. That's a Double Hit! Barbecue flavor is good, I will return, but probably to a different location in Charlotte -- Single Hit. Cost of the meal -- here's the problem .....  Its a crying shame when a restaurant feels like their food is SO good they can charge OUTRAGEOUS prices, seat you at a table when you needle them to, impress you with how quickly they can serve you, and NEVER attempt to make it up to you any other way. Friends, that is an OUT! Hence, two stars and I may return --- one day.",

I know that is not really saying much seeings that BBQ in Charlotte is known for being mediocre at best, but if you are craving BBQ, and you are in charlotte, this is the best spot period.  Service is always great, food always comes out quick, and the beer is always ice cold.   I suggest getting the bacon wrapped jalapenos. Matter fact order yourself two orders of 'em and thank me later. As for the cheerwine burnt ends, I think they miss the mark, but I know people who love them. I also don't much care for the mac and cheese here, reminds me of grade school when you got the rubbery over cooked underseasoned mac and cheese with the skin on it from the lunch lady who looked like Chris Farley in a hair net, but hey, maybe that's just me. I will say if you dump some of the BBQ sauce into the mac and cheese, it defiantly churches it up a bit and makes it palatable.   This maybe the best BBQ in Charlotte, but I don't believe they have the best sauces in my personal opinion but they are a close 2nd. I'll take good BBQ with an average sauce over bad BBQ with great sauce any day.",

Our server was helpful and friendly and attentive without hovering. Everything we ordered (and the table was groaning, I'm sure) was spot-on! Meats were tender and smoky, sides were all delicious, hush puppies were crunchy and delightful. We all left happily filled up and the one in our party who \"was never really crazy about barbecue\" is now absolutely converted and anxious to return. Definitely on our list of favorites now!",

Maybe customers at Midwood should eat first, to really taste the food, then drink their spirits to help them forget they just overpaid for mediocre BBQ.  In case you think I'm wrong-take a drive up to Saluda, NC It just 90 minutes west of here-there's a place called Green River BBQ   Their brisket sandwich is as good as great sex!  It's a hole in the wall, been there for years, owned and operated by a woman who cares about the food, the service, the customer.",

When I come, I usually get the Well Fed combo platter (sometimes Pig Out when really hungry) and the 4 proteins I choose are Carolina chopped pork, Saint Louis style pork ribs, beef brisket, and pulled chicken BBQ. It comes with hushpuppies and two sides (I absolutely love their cream corn hands down). The BBQ sauce there is absolutely delicious and I can't get enough of it. Service is great and efficient. It doesn't take us long to order because we get the same thing and the wait is relatively short. I definitely recommend everyone to download their reservation app to reserve a table rather than driving there and waiting till your table is ready. Parking is very limited that sometimes you might have to park at the shopping village lot across the street if it's filled. Servers are very friendly and helpful. This place gets a lot of business, especially since it's not that far from uptown and everyone enjoys walking around the Plaza Midwood location.",

Not a very large place and parking isn't plentiful in the immediate area, but don't let that detour you from stopping in.  You can start smelling the smoke doing its work before you even enter.  Walked in at 7:30 on a Wednesday and it was crowded but were able to get seated right away at a table but decided to sit at the bar instead.  Decent beer selection and heavy on the local breweries.  Split appetizer of the pimento cheese fries, no meat on it as we didn't want to fill up, but it was a lot and excellent.  Added a little hot sauce for a kick made these even better.  Split a 3 taco plate, one chicken and two pork BBQ, liked the pork but the chicken was outstanding.  Also shared a side of the smoked veggies and collards that were both very good.  They make their own pepper vinegar and it is good on everything, especially the greens.  Would recommend but it is a BBQ place, expect to walk out with a hint of that great smoke aroma with you so keep in mind what you are doing after.",

This was the 2nd time I went to Midwood, and both time they were fantastic! We were the first people to show up when they opened at 11, as we had to make the trek back to Asheville for our flight back to Miami. As I was the only one that had frequented before, i helped my group order and we all loved every item that came! I had the combo platter, which is essentially a bbq smorgasbord where you pick 4 protein items. I went with the bbq pulled pork, the st. Louis style ribs, the burnt ends and the brisket. You have the option to go lean, fatty, or somewhere in the middle. I went for the middle bc i wanted the full flavor of both! My wife had the cedar smoked salmon which had the best smokey flavor! My friends ordered the special of the day, the massive beef rib. It's exactly what the name implies: a MASSIVE RIB WITH TONS OF MEAT. It was delectable! Also, being sunday, they had $5 tito's bloody Mary's! Cant beat that!!!   Seriously top notch bbq, midwood is the reigning champ for me....until I visit dallas and Memphis this year.  Dont go anywhere else in Charlotte for Great bbq!!",

Everything was on point, indoor/outdoor seating with no wait, the service was pleasant/quick and the food was EXCELLENT! Started out with some bacon wrapped jalapenos, all nice size, plenty of bacon and cheese with just enough heat. I couldn't decide what I wanted so I ordered the 4 protein platter with burnt ends, smoked sausage, brisket and pulled pork. On the side some crinkle fries, baked beans and hush puppies. All the protein was cooked perfectly, moist with just enough smokeyness. The stand alone for me was the burnt ends, so damn good I didn't want it to end but it was all very good. The have some sauces available that aren't even necessary if u ask me but they were good one a more transitional and the other a vinegar based. I perfered tge vinegar based. The baked beans were some of the best ive had good consistency excellent taste. To wash it all down a seasonal smoked beer available for a limited time, to me tasted like a light lager went perfectly with the meal. Ending on a tastey bowl of delicious banana pudding that I wish i had gotten the larger size of. All in, a great experience. If am ever back in this area I will for sure return.",

Better than Mac's and most of the well known competition in town, but that isn't saying much.  Charlotte is a desert for solid southern BBQ.  The jalapeno poppers are good.  I'm down whenever.  The wings are pretty good.  Although, I'd rather have McCoy's smoke house if that was the only reason I was going.  The combo options seem to be the best deal if you have more than 3 or so people.  Get the brisket, get the ribs and then whatever else suits your fancy.  Bottom line.  I'll be back.  But, it wouldn't be hard for another place to sway my vote for best BBQ in the queen city.",

I've never had issues being sat, but I've also never seen this restaurant empty, so I recommend plan accordingly.  However, the food is great (I recommend the beef brisket with the fat or burnt ends) and the servers are amazing.  Everytime I've been in, our server has chatted us up, given us great advice as to places to check out, and is very timely with the drinks, meal, and check.  I've never had to wait or wondered where my server was.  The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 star rating is because the food isn't consistently top-notch.  I've been in and have had the best burnt ends I've ever tasted, and I've been in and been really disappointed with my meal.

The beef brisket was juicy, tender and made up for the fact that they didn't have pulled pork as an option. The fat melted in your mouth and I cleared the plate. The mac&cheese was so incredibly cheesy and gooey, and I will definitely be returning! The cream corn with jalapenos is an interesting twist that you won't regret. There are two different options of cole slaw, I got the bbq slaw, and it went great with the sweet sauce on my brisket. I'm picky when it comes to hushpuppies, and it was the first time I enjoyed someone else's other than mine. Great sauces, food and atmosphere. You get out of the car and smell smoked meats, you can't ask for anything better than that.",

A pre-pc, transgender bathroom treat.   The Cuban Sandwich is one of the best in Charlotte but I usually go for the beef brisker served heavily marbled or lean.   The sauces come in tang, sweet, hot, sangy sweet and sour. Both vinegar and molasses based sauces are readily available.  I love this restaurant.",

I have had it with brisket before and that is good enough for a meal. I had the brisket sandwich and it is really good of course as you can tell they take time to prepare their meat.   My favorite along with just about everyone's are the burnt ends. Must try! If you need to google burnt ends please do... but you must try them here!  Be warned that the parking it limited here and you will probably wait to get into this place.   This BBQ is well worth the wait and maybe  possible do a uber or lyft here because you can walk to Workman's friend , Legion, Whiskey Warehouse , or wherever afterwards.",

One is because the waiter at the front desk were not efficient even you already checked in with them. They asked me to wait for another 10-15 minutes even after I received the \"table is ready\" text. We waited for awhile (longer than 10-15 minutes) there was no one called us until I walked in and asked about the table again. Then she said \"Oh! Actually the table is ready!\" Then brought us to a table which I saw it was ready since we first stepped into the place. But our waiter of the night was pretty good. She cares about what we need. Just the waiter at the front desk wasn't that friendly. The other reason I gave them three stars is because THEY FORGOT OUR HASH PUPPIES!!! Me and my friend ordered a combo platter, pig-out, which is four kinds of meat of your choice with hushpuppies, pickle onions and other two sides of your choice. But THEY FORGOT THE HUSHPUPPIES. I have to say that it was also my mistake because I didn't realize that. I just felt that something was missing until I went back home and looked at the pictures I took for food, then I realized that THEY DID NOT GIVE US HUSHPUPPIES. This is kind of disappointed. But beyond these two reasons, their BBQ and drink are still pretty good! Also the appetizer, bacon wrapped jalapenos is really good! I'll definitely recommend that! Overall, I'll still recommend the place, just make sure they GIVE YOU YOUR HUSHPUPPIES!",

    "text": "BBQ joints come in all sorts of technicolor glory, from the creaky houses of yore, where you leave smelling like you're wearing SIde of Beef cologne with a sprinkle of sauce for good measure, to the newer, more refined varieties, each with their own specialty, from which they dare not stray.   These are not issues for Midwood Smokehouse, which does a variety of items on it's menu very, very well (thankyouverymuch), and they're delighted if you'd like another, come to mention it. And more of the good stuff is the attitude you'd best enter with in this wonderland of juicy cuts. At this sitting, I swooped in after the South Carolina mustard sauce with some brown sugar bacon (natch) on the back end. And if you're after some stand-up brisket, these guys do that pretty well too.   They brought some slabs out that would stand up to the stoutest Texan brought up on beef BBQ. In all, they do a brisk biz here and I though I was a shade concerned by the corner strip center space, I needn't be. These guys had all the bases covered (except, oddly, for root beer, which may not mean much to locals but is sometimes a staple of BBQ joints I've hit. The waitress responded to its suggestion like it was a pleasant surprise).   In the end, there was so much good stuff going down here that I couldn't tackle all of it. But these are the fun challenges you best savor again and again, like I'm sure I will.",

I usually get the BBQ pork sandwich and add cheddar cheese--unusual but makes the sandwich so good. Their bbq baked beans are also incredible! Looking for great southern bbq in Noda? This is the place to go!",

I liked the cuban sandwich, it wasn't amazing but it was certainly tasty & the mac & cheese is pretty decent,  but everything else there I've had has been seriously lacking.  I ordered a BBQ plate the second time we went there & the bbq was completely dry & their sauce did nothing to help it.  The third time I had a bbq sandwich & ended up with food poisoning.    A word of warning, the bacon jalapenos are no joke, they are absurdly spicy, too spicy for me even.",

The place was really loud, had sort of a bar atmosphere. Could see this being a great place to catch a game. They had a happy hour special on shiner bock which was awesome. Service wasn't that slow considering how busy they were. I ended up getting the brisket and when it finally arrived I wasn't too impressed. It was a little overcooked for my taste. Such a disappointment. My date had the cheese fries and they were pretty good. Overall not a bad experience but not a place I foresee myself visiting anytime soon.",

The pimento cheese fries rock and you don't need the meat on them unless you want to into a food coma before dinner.  I was surprised that the brisket was so well cooked.  They obviously take their time making it because it's really tender.  They have a large beer selection supporting the local Charlotte breweries among others.    Service was fast and they have a knowledgeable wait staff.  I also have ordered their bulk to-go food for parties and was not disappointed except for the kitchen manager who was kind of a jerk on the phone.",

The brisket was butter -- and that was the word floating about all night at the Brewer's Ball. So finally when I took a break I b-lined it over to their table.   The brisket was amazing, falling off your fork amazing.  The juices ran clear and the outside was perfectly seasoned. They also paired the brisket with a sweet vinegar and sweet onion mixture - wow that was truly amazing as well. Being on a carb free diet I left the bun behind and opted for a beer -- my carb cheat!   I'm truly excited to get my family into this establishment so that I can try their other offerings. And hopefully to see the staff again!   Hey Amy -- it was a pleasure meeting you last night!",

    "text": "When in the Carolinas one must find some legit BBQ! I'm glad we found this joint.  They have an extensive beer menu with every type of local beer your heart could desire. Also, a full bar with a variety of Moscow mules.   For an appetizer would ordered the bacon wrapped jalapenos... oh my my my!!! Four delicious jalapenos stuffed and wrapped with perfectly crisp bacon and served with a style ranch dipping sauce.. if I wasn't sitting with two other adults I easily could've inhaled all four of these!!    For our main course we ordered the pig out. It's a choice of four meats, two sides and hash puppies. Our meats were the beef brisket, dry ribs, pulled pork, and jalapeno cheddar sausage. Our sides were Mac n cheese and smoked veggies. I am assuming the star of the show is the meat because the portions of the sides included were small.. portioned for one person. We decided to ordered an extra side of Mac n cheese and sweet potato fries.   The meats- beef brisket was nice and juicy with a perfect ratio of meat and fat. The ribs were the star of the show for me.. literally the most meat I have ever had on a rib.. and the rub was perfect.. they didn't even need a sauce. The jalapeno cheddar sausage was not a let down either.. i loved that when I cut into them the cheddar came streaming out. Pulled pork is always good.. not too dry but you definitely have you pour some Carolina bbq to spice it up.   First time here.. won't be my last. See you next time smokehouse heaven!",

However,  I was given the wrong information. Thankfully our server, Wayne, was not only knowledgeable with the ingredients used, he double checked with the chef on everything for my son. I was so appreciative of that alone. Wayne was phenomenal and such a pleasure to have as our server. I'm from Miami where people like him are rare. He made our last dinner in North Carolina a memorable one!   The food was so delicious that I already want to go back! Even though their sauces are amazing, the food had so much flavor that it wasn't even needed! If your around a Midwood Smokehouse, put it on your list. You wont be disappointed!",

I've had Carolina pork before, but never liked it (though never in-state). Their version of the vinegar sauce has to be the reason it has become a staple in the Tarheel state. We couldn't get enough.

There might be lesser known barbeque places in Charlotte that are worth going to, but you can't go wrong here.  The ambience is that of a pretty typical restaurant bar. They do have an upstairs outdoor patio. Our service was fine for a group of four.  We tried the sampler with brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, a rack of ribs, and two sides (Mac and cheese and collared greens). The regular portion was enough to share for two people and the food was perfect. Unfortunately they were out of fatty brisket and burnt ends, which I would have loved to try, but when you go to a place an hour before closing that smokes their meats fresh daily, you're going to have that. They have the vinegary sauce and a more standard barbeque as well. Beer selection is mostly local crafts.  Carolina barbeque isn't my favorite regional style, but that's not a knock. If I'm being honest, I love them all, and I'm always looking for the local favorites when I'm on the road. You can get great food here.",

Midwood Smokehouse came up - at almost 1500 reviews, we had to see what all the fuss was about!  Midwood exceeded our expectations! We were seated right away and the server was very accommodating to us with a high chair and kids menu for our son. Glad to see that it is kid friendly, with a changing table in the restroom too. The rest of the visit went very smoothly despite seeming very busy for lunch.  Food wise, I ordered brisket based on the server's recommendation. I loved it! There was bbq sauce at the table but the meat didn't need any; it was so flavorful. Hungry husband had a 4 meat platter and loved his meal too. My favorite side was the bacon wrapped jalapenos. I only tried one as it was my husband's choice but they were very good. Prices were fair for the portions and quality.  The only negative was the parking. It was packed on a Friday afternoon (but no wait for a table, thankfully, using the Yelp option to reserve a table). We parked on the street and walked a short distance. We would definitely recommend this place to others and come back if we are in the area again!",

While we decided that it did, it wasn't perfect. We ordered 10 Wings Half Crispy Half Smoked with Ranch and Blue Cheese for $9 and a Large Plate of Pulled Pork with Hushpuppies, Coleslaw, and Mac & Cheese for $12.50. With tip it came to a little less than $30 for the two of us which is a fine price and the service was fast. However, our mac & cheese was pretty bad. No taste, a bit cold, and tough. The pulled pork was good but not even close to the best I've had. I really enjoyed the wings, hush puppies, and coleslaw though.

This location is has a nice section outside and two seating sections on the inside. The customer service was excellent the server was very knowledgeable and informed us about the many different options available. I like the old schoolness of the menu as they have large and small portion sizes of main plates. Also they have daily specials both food to drinks. The drink special I had was the Smokey Rita blood orange margarita. It was average, but they specialize in bbq. So I ordered the large Pulled bbq chicken. With Coleslaw sweet potato fries and hush puppies. The chicken was moist and ripe for their sauces. I tried all but the Carolina sauce, the spicy sauce was excellent but may be a little to spicy if you are not used to spicy. I'd say a 6 out of 10 on JJ spice scale. Unfortunately without the sauce the chicken was a little bland but still good. I also added some bread to my order, which I would recommend. Overall the service is great The food was good I would give it a 3.5 out of 5.",

Midwood is the exception, I love their Carolina pulled pork BBQ and I try and get there several times each year. Always busy and hoppin with customers, but always friendly staff and great food, well worth any wait. I also recommend their bacon wrapped jalapenos they are to die for :-) as well as the good local beers! I wish they would add a BBQ salad (very popular in Lexington) to their menu. I would be happy to be a beta tester/sampler of it if Midwood ever wants to try adding it to their menu. Highly highly recommend!!",

Got the 4 protein platter, upgrading chopped chix to burnt ends, with mac & cheese and beans as my sides...all good.  Food was room temp at best, which wasn't all that bad. Flavor was good, and portions were decent...a lil' skimpy on the brisket and heavy on the pork. Also, pork was on the too-salty side. Would have preferred to eat somewhere other than the bar, since it's a busy bar, but limited seating for 1 which isn't unusual.  Prices are very reasonable. My meal with 2 IPA's was $45. I'd be inclined to try another BBQ place next time, just to compare.",

I ordered the Well-Fed combo platter with chopped pork, beef brisket, 1/2 rack of ribs, and pulled chicken. My sides were creamed corn and Mac & cheese. This was way too much food for myself and I did not even finish 1/4 of it. My favorite meat was the ribs--the bone slid right off the meat. I could have done without the pulled chicken, it was not my favorite. The creamed corn was delicious. My favorite sauce was their South Carolina Mustard.  The bartenders were very busy, but super friendly and attentive to the customers at the bar.",

I mean, I like to have some fat on the meat, but when the fat to meat ratio is more fat, it seems like a waste. The smoked veggies, maybe it was because it was the end of the day, but I did not bother to eat them, they just tasted gross. Of course the fries were good!  Overall, I would come here to eat the chicken again and maybe try the burnt ends or the pulled pork,",

Everyone ordered different foods and EVERYTHING was cooked to perfection..the smoked wings were juicy and of good size, the ribs were fall off the bone tender, the chicken that came with the rib combo was moist but the skin was good and crispy. Even the burger was juicy..our sides included collard greens, sweet potato fries, Cole slaw, creamed corn and fries everything was great! They give good portion sizes so you will not leave hungry.

Because I am about to go to a festival, I limited my selection to the bacon wrapped jalapenos (to die for) and the pulled pork sandwich. These were everything great I could expect from a bbq joint.

The quality of the barbecue vies for 1st place in all of Charlotte every time I eat there, the local beer list is long, and the service is generally solid too.  However, over time, portions have steadily decreased. The last two times, I didn't get anything near what would reasonably be expected for the price I paid. I can go to any competitor at this point and get more food for less money, and the quality will be just as good.   Needless to say, I won't be heading back to Midwood any time soon. The quality of flavor alone isn't worth another sparse combo plate that maybe has 3/4 the amount of 'cue that it should, and only leaves me disappointed.",

They were delicious. The sauce was spicy and smokey! A truly great combination of flavors! And those damn Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos were outstanding. I mean any time you combine two of my personal faves it's got to be good, but the crispy bacon and stuffed jalapenos delighted my taste buds in so many ways! I only wish there were more on the plate!!!   There's so many things here I'm looking forward to try! The one downside is parking. It's just not enough here!

    "text": "I am a 60 year-old BBQ aficionado. When I travel the southern half of the U.S. (which is often), I am always in search of the best BBQ. I have had spectacular BBQ in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Kansas, and North Carolina... tiny mom & pop joints, chains, one-offs, the most famous, and unknowns. Midwood Smokehouse may be the best I've ever had, anywhere.   Though it's not my favorite, I do like good pulled pork. The pulled pork at Midwood is THE BEST I've ever eaten anywhere, hands-down. Doesn't even need sauce. Terrific smokey flavor, good char on the outside bits, just amazing.  The brisket is also maybe the best I've ever eaten. Tender, smokey... you can get it lean or juicy and more fatty... really incredible.  We tried their bacon-wrapped, deep-fried (!) rib appetizer and though a bit crispy and dry for my wife's taste (she's a Californian and I'm a southerner), I thought it was excellent.  Creamed corn was delicious... her grilled veggies were truly excellent. Servings were HUGE (\"Are you SURE that's the 'small plate'?\"  And big kudos to manager Natalie who went out of her way to welcome us, and even personally make some sandwiches (off menu) we could take on the plane for our flight back to CA. Every restaurant in America would do well to try to find someone like her!  Will definitely eat there any time we're in Charlotte. Have also eaten at the Ballantyne location... same excellent food.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

The burnt ends is phenomenal, the pulled pork and pulled chicken are smoked to perfection where it's dry because of the smoke but flavorful and not dried out. The St. Louis Ribs are literally fall off the bone and the dry rub is so good it needs no sauce. The brisket is actually Texas style brisket and is better than some place in Texas. Their sauces are really good as well and I didn't do the vinegar sauce because I'm not a vinegar guy, but their house BBQ sauce and the Habanero version is good. Their BBQ beans are legit and has meat in it. Their other sides were delicious according to my colleagues. And our server Wil was very hospitable and provided great real recommendations and great service. But if you are in Charlotte and you are going to eat... EAT here!",

This place had a good rating so we went. Our server was really nice friendly and helpful. And he gave us the hard sell on their \"lunch special\" which was smoked short rib. The food came out and it was big and tasty. We both loved the food however we were both struck with awe as we saw our bill. The lunch \"special\" was 29 FUCKING dollars. When we saw that this place was not to expensive and saw the menu. We thought the lunch special would be similar to the affordable prices of the rest of the menu.   What we were given was a bait and switch that ended up fucking us over in the end. I'll go back here but I'm definitely not going to fall for this scumbag move by our waiter again.",

I personally find myself not easily impressed by any of the \"OMG it's the best blah blah blah\" places people typically raved about.   Honestly I have no beef with Midwood Smokehouse, and I frequent enough to be \"a fan.\" I should disclose the fact that I'm not a big BBQ person, thus this rarely is my 1st choice to dine at. With that being said, I suppose their foods are consistent and reasonably priced. I have my fav item here, which is their (not so) small salad with smoked salmon added. It's the most food you can get for $8, and semi healthy. Their Avocado Green Goddess is my dressing choice.   I do have to say service is hit & miss. Brian was great this last time, which was a welcomed change. One time we sat at the bar, and the bartender refused my request to leave my salmon whole (I am not a cat, I don't like shredded fish). I thought that was rude and un-restaurant of them to refuse my otherwise reasonable request. PLUS parking is a pain, especially with all the new housing built nearby.   If I can offer half star, this would be a solid 3.5-star place in my world. It's hump day, and I'll be nice and throw in the other half and made it a 4-star review.",

Mac and cheese was good but not amazing. The plate came wish hush puppies too. Those were small, but yummy. My fiance liked his sandwich but I wasn't as much of a fan. His jalapenos were good...but not amazing. Great craft beer selection. Definitely coming back! They had smoked salmon on the menu that sounded delish.",

    "text": "Visited here Sunday Night. Parking, as everyone says, is a challenge, but not that bad.   We had just come from spending the whole weekend hiking in Great Smokey Mountains NP, so we were HUNGRY.   Got seated right away, which was a pleasant surprise as they seemed to be very busy.   I got the sampler plate, small version, my wife got a large chicken. And let me just say the meat was excellent. The brisket was one of the best I have had, melting on the tongue, great spice without being too salty, Next time I come I will order like three plates of that. Not to say the pork wasn't excellent as well, I really liked the vinegar heavy NC style on the pork. The ribs, also quite nice. The sausage, well, a little salty, but the mustard dip made up for that in spades. I give this place A+ for food.  I would have liked to see a little more of the vinegar heavy NC style in the dishes. We had been out in Oklahoma for three years, and while the brisket was excellent, in NC I'd like to see it done NC style not Texas Style, and the ribs, were great St Louis style ribs, again, I'd like to see what they'd look like with the awesome NC vinegar marinate the pork used.  My wife's chicken was great as well. Again food fantastic.  Our service was brisk, and why I am not giving five stars. I've worked restaurants before and am pretty sure they were short staffed (despite getting seated right away it is clear they were turning and burning), and our server was a bartender that got a demotion to waitress for the night, and was a little unhappy about it. Service was crisp and efficient, but we got our check dropped before we had a chance to order desert. As we both ordered a lot of meat, I can understand that the server thought we wouldn't have room, but we had been hiking all weekend. The proper forms of service were performed, but it was a bit brisk, and we definitely got the impression that they wanted to turn the table.   Nothing wrong with that on a busy Sunday night, and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone that asked. That brisket was worth coming back for. Though I just can't help but wonder what it would be like with the pork preparation or similar. It is a nine hour drive from Allentown PA, I'll drive down if you make a NC style brisket. JUST TO EAT THAT.  Great restaurant. Was a nice treat after a weekend of hiking. I figured we smelled like campfire smoke anyway, so a smokehouse was the place to go.",

Tell them to double you up on the pickled onions. They're like candy. Sweet, earthy candy!  Burnt ends plate is awesome, too. But I recommend you telling them to do the extra sauce on the side.  Their best house sauce (they're all house made, btw) is the sweet habanero sauce. Don't be scared of the habanero part. They did an awesome job of making it where the heat is just right.  Round it all out with the bacon-wrapped jalapenos and the mac&cheez, and you'll be set!  Wait staff is super chill, so that's always a plus.",

Then you have to stand at the crowded bar hoping to eventually get noticed so you can get your food, which usually takes around 10 minutes. The bartenders are too busy to be managing takeout orders on top of everything else, and it seems especially absurd when you keep looking back at two hostesses who aren't doing anything and aren't even paying attention to what's going on around them. Portions here also tend to be small for the price. All in, it's good BBQ, but I don't know if I'll keep going out of my way to come here - between the service and the portion sizes, you can probably find better value elsewhere in CLT.

I ordered the brisket sandwich as did my friend. I ordered mine with pimento cheese and my friend ordered cheddar, however we both received blue cheese. I really do not like blue cheese and this blue cheese completely over powered the sandwich. I would of complained but our server wasn't even the one to bring us our food and we didn't even see him again til the check came.   I don't know if I'll be returning to give it another try.",

Everything is very good, and I place them tied with mac's for the two best bbq spots in Charlotte.  If you want ribs go to Mac's, burnt ends come to midwood.  Brisket at both locations is excellent, but prepared differently.  You won't go wrong coming here for excellent BBQ  I went here again with family in town and had the Pulled Pork Plate.  Nice portion of food for $10, but more importantly it was probably the best pulled pork I've eaten.  Tender, flavorful, perfectly smoked.  Pulled pork just put Midwood ahead of Mac's in my opinion.",

I ordered the large plate of pulled chicken in mustard sauce with bacon wrapped jalapenos and pimiento cheese fries as my sides. The pulled chicken was very tender, and the mustard sauce was decent. I also got some of Midwood's habanero BBQ sauce on the side, and this put the chicken over the top to amazing! That sauce is the bomb! Not too spicy, not too vinegary, and not too sweet- just a perfect balance.  The bacon wrapped jalapenos were amazing. Extremely smoky, great bacon flavor, a little cheese to balance everything out, and spice from the jalapeno. I was able to have pimiento cheese fries as my other side for a $1 upcharge and they were good as well but not great. My girlfriend ordered sweet potato fries, and they were awesome! I would honestly rather have the plain sweet potato fries than the pimiento cheese fries (but I love sweet potato fries so I am biased). She also had the Cuban sandwich which was good but not amazing in my opinion. The hush puppies that came with the BBQ plate weren't bad but just average.  Our server was friendly, the atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty nice (although there is a slight smoky smell inside as any good BBQ place should have so keep that in mind), and the prices were great for the amount of food.",

I also tried the smoked wings - which are offered naked or sauced. Next time I know to go with naked. The wings alone were amazing, but the sauce just didn't do anything for my personal taste. It didn't taste like much of anything to be honest. I couldn't pinpoint it as spicy, it wasn't barbecue, couldn't find any taste of ketchup. So I could definitely do without. But otherwise I'll be back soon.   Location wise, I had to turn around 3 time's because I kept missing it. It's easy to drive right past since its connected with a larger office building, and not to mention the parking on weekends is impossible. But none the less, delicious food.",

The problem is, that it's so affordable, we can get too many sides and then end up being full before our wonderful, juicy, fall-off-the-bone MAN-MEAT portions arrive. (Make sure you try the fatty brisket! Uh-oh! Mouth's a-waterin'!) And then we have to be abolutely miserable to try and stuff down dessert. I mean, we do try...  This place is excellent. Service is a tad bit on the wonky side sometimes, and parking can be an adventure (as if the lot's full, you'll have to park across the street and play Frogger with the crazy Plaza-Midwood drivers), but I implore you...nay, I dare you to find better BBQ in Charlotte!

    "text": "I came here recently with a large group during a 3 day conference being held downtown.  Despite being told by multiple cab drivers that Charlotte is not known for its BBQ, this place was surprisingly good (and I say this after a recent visit to Austin where all we did was eat BBQ the entire time).   We came with a party of 12 on a Friday night at 7:15 p.m. with no reservation.  The host was very friendly and kept us updated as to our remaining wait time.  We ended up waiting about 45 minutes - 1 hour; luckily we had drinks at the bar to entertain us.    I ordered the smoked half chicken Midwood style.  This dish was only $10 and came with hush puppies and two sides!!!  I got the baked beans, vinegar coleslaw, and collard greens.  The chicken was juicy and tender and the BBQ sauce had a nice spiciness to it without being to vinegary.  The baked beans were delicious and had a good amount of meat.  The collard greens and coleslaw were also solid.  I attempted to eat only half of the massive portion of food but somehow ended up finishing the entire plate.  Others in my group had the burnt ends, mac and cheese, ribs, etc. and all said they enjoyed their food.  One thing that could make this place better is if they offered biscuits or cornbread...all they have currently is Texas toast.   Our server was extremely attentive and friendly.  She didn't bat an eye when we requested separate checks even though I'm sure this was a supreme hassle.  Good atmosphere and food - I recommend coming here if you are in the mood for BBQ!",

Out of the 5 meats to choose from, I give my stamp of approval to the oh-so-juicy brisket and the tender and succulent ribs packed full of flavor. For sides, go for perhaps the BEST BAKED BEANS I've ever eaten!! (It's gotta be that molasses...) The mac and cheese was A-OK.  Tip: Ask for sauces!

    "text": "So whether you plan on going to Midwood Smokehouse for the first time or fiftieth time, here's my take on a few things:  Parking - there's a larger lot in the back of Midwood. Hopefully, you luck up and are able to have ample spots to choose from. If not, street parking is available. Yup, parking sucks in this particular area of Plaza during peak hours, it is what is.  Food - you want to start off with some apps? Go for the pimento cheese fries (with brisket). Generally, I am not a fan of pimento cheese, but I will gobble these cheese fries right up. Also, order some bacon wrapped jalapenos simply because you must (personally, I'd ask for them to cook them just a little longer than normal).  -Midwood chopped salad (with pork or chicken). Yes, I go to a BBQ place and order a salad because it's really good. In fact, it's my favorite salad in all of Charlotte. The small portion is quite large enough for me.  -As for actual BBQ, go for the pulled pork and/or smoked wings. On a recent visit, I learned there's Midwood sauce so make sure you ask for some of that as well.  There are ample reasons why this place is consistently busy (I just listed a handful above) but they get right down to serving really good food in a friendly and fast manner.",

Yet, to their defense the table beside us had a full rack and they looked delicious, so good I was ready to pay them double to steal them;) They also were packed so I'm sure they are a huge seller.

    "text": "We so thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant.  My family are visiting Charlotte for the night and wanted to try a \"local\" place; Yelp had like 1500 reviews and 4.5* so I figured it had to be a safe bet.  Yelp's \"wait list\" feature was active (I'd never tried it); it said there was a 10-20 minute wait and let me click through for \"sign up\" or whatever.  We grabbed a Lyft, and when we got to the restaurant there was definitely a line.  We checked in with the hostess, she thanked us for letting her know.  When I told her I was \"checking in\" she knew my name, so I guess this isn't a heavily-used feature.  Which is a shame because she seated us immediately.  Our server (\"Ty\") was awesome, and speedy.  We noticed a lot of staff, plus I assume two managers (not wearing aprons) all quick on their feet and always moving.  We had other waitstaff running our food, lots of people just stopping by to check on us or clean up some napkins or whatever.  Very good service.  The food: excellent.  We had two kids meals (chicken fingers & a pork sandwich), both went down quickly.  My wife and I split nachos and the burnt ends.  The nacho plate was crazy big, like easily a 3-4 person \"appetizer.\"  A little overwhelming, but excellent.  A nice kick from jalapenos, offset with sweet corn and bbq sauce.  Very nice flavor mix.  The burnt ends were not really burnt at all, just very tender and flavorful.  It was served with hushpuppies, which were a little different from the \"fried cornbread\" I'm used to seeing but still really good.  Wife loved them.  All the sides were also great.  Two sauces: the typical NC vinegar stuff, which is the best NC sauce I've ever had.  Plus a more standard brown sugar / tomatoe-based sauce, also good.  They listed some other \"SC-style\" with the chicken, which I assume means mustard-base, but unless the nacho chicken had it, I didn't try any.  The nacho chicken tasted really good though, it definitely had something in there.  For dessert we had a \"pecan cobbler.\"  This is NC, so we say \"pee-can\" here.  Weird, but you get used to it.  The cobbler was sorta like a turbo puh-cawn pie with extra nuts, and topped with a scoop of vanilla.  It was really good.  Unfortunately we were pretty stuffed and couldn't finish.  The portions were large, and overall pretty inexpensive.  The restaurant was PACKED but we got our food quickly and never had to wait for (or even ask for) anything.  We walked out for under $50 (before tip), and we loved it.  We will be back.  Next time we're gonna try the wings and maybe some smoked chicken.",

Let's go back to the sausage though- when you bite into that warm weenie the cheese exploded out ! I don't know if they change the flavors of their sausage but A+. Server said burnt ends and brisket was the most popular stuff. Brisket came lean, mixed and fatty. I got mixed- very tasty. I think it'll be more worth it if I got a plate with more meats.

By now you should know my rule of thumb when it comes to Charlotte: if Frank Scibelli's name is attached, it's going to be damn good. I love their smoked wings. Usually, I'll get those and a bunch of sides. We already addressed the BWJ. I'm also a huge fan of the smoked veggies and creamed corn. True story: they took the creamed corn off the menu for a hot second and so many people got upset that they had to bring it back. I don't ever order pulled pork anywhere I go, so for me my go to proteins are the ribs and brisket. I just had burnt ends for the first time last week and they were fabulous. This is going to sound random, but the grilled cheese is great here as well.   Pretty good beer selection. You can also order online for pickup. Parking is not great, but there is a lot behind the building as well. Just pay attention to the signs.",

We all have different taste buds so I'm sure that's relative.   I'm from Cali and I've had some hella good ass barbecue before.

I wish I would have remembered his name ( bigger middle age guy who must be pumping the iron). He had the just right level of interaction and was very attentive without being over the top.   Being on a Keto plan I had the salmon salad which I thought was the star of the show!  The only thing I would consider on changing was the crinkle cut el cheap fry. I did not taste them due to Keto but noticed those that had them didn't eat many of them.   Highly recommend if you want some good que or a damn good salmon salad.",

But, luckily my friend put the brakes on me and we ended up at Midwood Smokehouse which was roughly 13 minutes away. Saweeeeeeet!  The grub:  Smoked Wings-super tasty and smokey and almost tasted like bacon! I don't eat swine, so having something that brought me back to my bacon eating days gave me all types of life. My only gripe was that the skin was chewy and gooie as if the fat hadn't rendered out. However, I'll totally go back for these.  Burnt Ends-these were tasty as well. There were fatty pieces attached to brisket ends and covered in BBQ sauce. These didn't blow my mind, but they were tasty.  Hush puppies-delicious, we got more to go.  Coleslaw-this was more of a vinegar based coleslaw then mayonnaise based. I actually didn't mind it! It's a nice compliment and the vinegar helped but through the fatty foods.  Soooooo I didn't get any pics because the greedy hunger was real when the food arrived :). This place is worth giving a go!",

I wish I could stay for the Wednesday special consisting of Dino Bone Beef Ribs, anyway we ordered the Pig Out plater, this came with three proteins ours were pulled chicken, St. Louis Style Ribs and Brisket sling with two sides ok, the star was the brisket this was a very delicious smoked brisket what's unique is that you can order it with fat cap, lean or no fat of course got to have a little of that fat. The staff was out of site and decor was great. I would definitely recommend to friends and family for a great BBQ experience",

She was amazing with recommendations (drink/appetizers). Tonight I choose to go with a Pinot Nior (very rich and dry like I like). We got the bacon wrappped jalapenos as an appetizer (PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND ORDER). They were out right along with our drinks (I told you they were speedy). We order the Protein 4 combo and when I say it was AMAZING!!! (Ribs/brisket/jalapeno sausage/pulled chicken)... omg I will definitely be back!! It's really one of my fave go-to.",

We heard a lot of hype about this place from our friends but when I walked in I wasn't expecting much...boy was I wrong.         First the service was friendly and prompt. We came in with a party of 7 yet it felt like we got our food 5mins after ordering. I seriously don't know how they got it out so fast.          The food was hot, tasty, and the portions were huge. They had a lot of vegetarian options for a bbq  restaurant. I also loved the create your own salad (as in they create it for you not a salad bar) where you are able to choose up to 7 different ingredients to compose your salad. We ordered the small version for $6 and it was huge!!             The meat was tender and flavorful. They had interesting dressings and sauces to dip both your sides and meat in. Definitely will be visiting this place again. It's mid range in price but definitely worth it because you will be taking left overs home for sure!",

We started with the pimento cheese fries and the smoked wings. Both appetizers were done right. The wings had an amazing smoky flavor. The pimento fries were cheesy and the fries crispy. For my entree, I got the burnt ends platter with the grilled veggies, and creamed corn. The platters also come with onions and hush puppies. The burnt ends were super crispy and Smokey and had just the right amount of sauce on them. I can't wait to visit Charlotte again to come back to this place!",

I raved so much about how every single things all the way down to the onions was so delicious that my husband started sending me text with him and his friends orders. What started out as a quick bite for one became a very expensive trip with a bunch of food. But its worth it. Portions are wonderful, service is awesome and the food came out fast, hot and beyond delicious. Sorry no pictures of my food when I dined on. It smelled so good I forgot to take any. I'll be back soon. Its worth the 4 hour drive. To go order: Hot mess, philly cheese steak, more greens, fries, and smoked wings (crispy) and another order of bacon wrapped jalapenos .",

Quick Summary  - Ribs, pork and brisket are very good  - Sides are okay  - Place deserves its high Yelp rating  - Service was excellent  - Parking can be a bitch  - Full bar with local/regional beers on draft  - Highly recommend  Long Review The proteins on the menu here are pretty extensive.  Chopped pork, brisket, beef and pork burnt ends, chicken, ribs and salmon.  You can even order the brisket lean, fatty or a combo which I found pretty cool.  Four sauces served with the food.  Eastern NC vinegar, sweet tomato base, low country SC sauce (mustard base) and a spicy habanero.  I gravated to the spicy habanero.  The sides we ordered were okay.  I'm sure the other sides are better that what I tried (sweet potato and regular fries).  The service was fantastic.  Our waitress, Sydney, was excellent,  She explained the menu and offered recommendations.    This place is very popular and it only has a small parking area at the front and side.  If you can't swing it then you may be forced to find street parking.  FYI, there is a sign on the door warning not to park in the shopping center across the street.",

My wife and I had moved from Memphis, TN and considered ourselves fairly good judges of BBQ from not only living in one of the towns known for great BBQ but also competing in competitions for many years.  It is hard to find a place that actually uses a smoker on site, most either cook off site an then reheat or steam their meat.  Smoke flavor is amazing, only knock is that the menu is a little limited and they don't have a \"sampler\" platter where you can get the brisket, pulled pork etc all on one plate.  Great addition to plaza midwood and will be going back for more!  Oh yea and a great beer selection.",

GREAT hushpuppies.  great sauces and the chicken was very good as well.  dont bother ordering the wings as they are nothing special, not bad but save your stomach space for other things.  we sat right down and had a very nice server.  i will def be back frequently to try some other stuff and wanted to try the cream cheese brownie but couldnt put another thing in my mouth.  very reasonably priced as well i got the combo \"well-fed\" the smaller one and when they brought it out to me i thought it was the big one that i had seen on other peoples tables, for $16 it was a heck of a deal.  im still going to hit macs up as its good and right down the street from me but this place may have the edge on the bbq hotspots in town...for now",

My wife and I split the combo plate which included (moo, cluck and oink) brisket, pulled chicken, ribs and chopped pork.  We chose bbq beans and coleslaw for our sides.  We had plenty to eat and took the rest home for another meal all for $21!  The chicken with the mustard sauce was my favorite.",

That was some good banter you wont get at a lot of places. It stays packed so be ready. Good people watching, great beer. pretty good BBQ. It isn't hardcore BBQ but this is Charlotte and good luck to you if you are looking for the holy grail. This is a great weekend place, with good food, nice people, great beer.

My only gripe was that I ordered the half slab of ribs with sweet potato fries and mac & Cheese, and the ribs were a little dry. Still good but I wanted them a little more tender. The mac & cheese noodles were a little under done, I would've liked them a little softer. Great beer menu and the sweet potato fries were delicious, fresh out the fryer like I like them. My husband had the burnt ends, he liked them. We would go back, next time I will try the brisket.",

Started with the queso with pulled pork.  I thought it was really good and the small was plentiful for 2 of us.  My other friend had the bruschetta and he seemed to enjoy it.  I went with brisket on the servers recommendation, and opted for lean with mac n cheese.  Brisket was good, but I wish I had gotten fatty, it seemed like it would have been a bit tastier.  The hushpuppies were awesome!!  I really loved them.  I liked the onions, they were nice and sweet.  Mac n cheese was okay, least favorite part of the meal.  Service was good, we were seated right away since it was early.  I really liked the interior of this place and they had a great 80s music station on which I loved!  I had no issue with saltiness with any of the food and I am someone who doesn't add salt to anything so I would have noticed right away.  All in all I liked it a lot and I would not hesitate to go back, its close to home too, so yay!!",

The parking and wait can sometimes but an issue but I can assure you that it is worth the wait. They offer a service that will text you when your table is ready so you can go across the street for a drink while you're waiting. Also, getting there early is definitely recommended in order to get decent parking.",

Tried a whole bunch of different places and this is by far the best! The only reason it only gets 4 out of 5 stars is strictly because I have only been here once and I need to try some more of their food.   I ordered the \"Super Bird\" let me just say one word, AMAZING!! It was so so good, I also had some brisket which again was AMAZING, fall off the bone just like it should be! You can never go wrong with fried pickles and they do it right. It is not pickles chips like most places have but actual pickle slices. What this does is make it have more pickle flavor without all of the breading which is very good.The waitstaff is friendly and very inviting. That in itself is hard to find. We had the waiter Zach and he was great. Made a bunch of good recommendations on the menu and even other restaurants in the area.   A whole lotta people try BBQ and not many people can succeed and let me tell you, they go it right!",

I ordered the brisket plate and got sweet cream corn and baked beans as my sides. Being that I have been consistently disappointed with the brisket around here I didn't keep my expectations high when ordering but when I say I think I went to heaven within the first few bites, I am not exaggerating. It was AMAZING! It was so juicy and just fell apart. The flavor was on point and they do give you yummy dipping sauce, but I didn't even use it because the brisket was so good it didn't need it. I wish I could have had just a plate plied high with brisket upon brisket. The sides were just as good and did not disappoint. I am so happy I found this place as this will be my go to spot for now and always.  The service was just as good as the food and you can tell that Smokehouse must have a good rapport because it was packed early on a Wednesday night. The owners or managers, not sure which, come by often making sure your dinning experience is going well, which I always appreciate and find very professional and caring. The place itself has a good vibe with a mix of different kinds of people and ages.   I will most definitely be back often and can't wait to try everything on the menu! But most likely I will always incorporate brisket into my meal any way I can! Cheers!",

    "text": "Finally got a chance to try this place out after passing by it so many times on the way to Plaza shopping and bars.  We split a large pulled pork plate and a small chopped salad.  The pulled pork comes with the vinegar based sauce, but we were lucky they forgot to pour it on top so they put it on the side, and since it was my first time there, I asked to try out their other sauces.  I preferred their Midwood signature, which was sweet and smokey, over the NC vinegar, but to each their own.  The pork itself was just ok, as I've had better and I've had worse.    Now to the sides.  We tried the bacon wrapped jalapenos and the bbq baked beans.  The jalapenos were good with cheese inside, but the bacon was just too fatty as it was all baked together and didn't cook enough.  I was also wary of the baked beans since I know many places who just open up a can and serve.  Theirs were cooked right with some pieces of meat in it, making it very tasty.  I would definitely recommend the beans to any barbecue fan.  Overall, the service was pretty good, as our server was keen to help us with the menu and seemed knowledgeable.  We came at an off-hour during the week, so I can't speak to the crowds here, but I can see an issue if the cramped parking lot that writhes around the building gets packed.  Will come back to try their other entrees and sandwiches!",

Again I hate asking for water and again I had to ask and for refills.  We started with fried pickles and bacon wrapped jalapenos. Fried pickles were great however a little greasy but solid 4.5/5 in my book.  Bacon wrapped jalapenos just average 3/5. It was missing spice and flavor. I mainly tasted bacon. My husband and I split a rack of ribs which included two sides.  More than enough to share. We didn't finish. Mac and cheese was good 3/5 but I prefer a different style.  Cole slaw was great full of flavor 5/5. We finished off the meal with the small banana pudding which was perfect for two to share.  Light and fluffy 5/5.  We had a decent time but nothing to pull me back to this place.  If you are in the area might be good to try but I wouldn't make a special trip.  Just another thing we were lucky we got seats at the bar otherwise party of two was at least a thirty minute wait at 9pm on a Friday night. Usually past my bedtime Update!!! 8/6/15 I love that midtown responded my review and it was NOT a generic response it was detailed to my review. That brought then up to four stars for sure!  It's nice to know they use fresh jalapenos therefore spice on the appetizer will very.  I look forward to going back and writing a five star review!",

We were told our food would be ready in 15 mins and we waited well over 40mins. The manager eventually came out and said they ran out of chicken and that's why they had to restart our whole order. Worst experience ever and I'd highly suggest to not come here",

A few of us split the queso, and the other side had the queso with brisket (which is a tad more delicious). I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich, with the slaw on the side and a side of BBQ Baked Beans. Instead of getting the SC Mustard sauce that comes on the sandwich, I asked for a sweet sauce and they provided me with the Midwood House BBQ sauce. That was suuuch a great decision! The sandwich was wonderful; the pulled chicken was tender, and there was so much meat that I was able to take some home. The baked beans, which our server Kecia recommended, were delicious!! They had meat in them (for all the plant-based eaters) and they were sweet and soft. The cole slaw was also pretty delicious. I was at a table with 5 other ladies, and all of us got bags to go home. The sweet tea was just a tad bit strong, but good indeed. I'll be back soon to try the brisket.  Had to make a quick edit; I think the chicken messed with my stomach. It started hurting about 20 minutes after eating, and was sensitive for a good 2 days. I'd recommend the brisket and be careful with the chicken.",

Drank local beer Cowboy Betty.  I really enjoyed the Pork barbeque although it is not traditional North Carolina BBQ.  It had a delicious sweet & smoky flavor that was able to hold its own without adding any sauce.  Very tender and tasted as if basted in drippings from the cook.  We asked for a bun or roll but it was not available.  We were offered Texas Toast but did not try it. 4.75 Stars  The sausage was also very good. 4 Stars  My friend John really enjoyed the brisket but I did not.  The texture was right and passed the pull test but my piece did not have the smoky flavor I was looking for.  It didn't have much flavor at all.  I gave John the rest of my brisket and he said that his was better.  Not sure if I was just unlucky.  It tasted better with the Midwood Sauce on it. 2.5 Stars  We were really excited to try the Burnt Ends based on the waiters description.  They were a bit dry and texture was a little tougher than I had imagined.  2.5 Stars   Collard greens 3.5 Stars Cowboy Betty:  Really nice wheat beer. 4.5 Stars Slaw: 2.5 Stars  Service was nice and waiter was well informed about the menu but he didn't seem to be focused on the floor.  Once food got out, employees seemed focused on conversations with each other and did not look back at the tables for longer than normal periods of time.   All in all we really enjoyed our meal.  The pulled pork, sausage and collard greens were excellent and we would highly recommend the restaurant if in the Charlotte, NC area.",

    "text": "Who can go to North Carolina and not get some BBQ? Unfortunately, Charlotte is not one of the main BBQ hubs in the state. Midwest Smokehouse, however, serves up some delicious BBQ.  The Smoked Wings ($8) is a pound of chicken wings that are smoked then finished on the grill. They were meaty, but still tender and had the right amount of smoke. My mouth is watering just thinking about them they were so good.  The Combo Platter (Well Fed $24) comes with your choice of 4 proteins. We chose pulled pork which was smoky and delicious; beef brisket which was tender and full of flavor with just the right amount of fat; burnt ends which had a nice char and a juicy fat cap; and some St. Louis style pork ribs which were fall off the bone tender. The platter comes with pickled onions and hush puppies, which were tender with a nice corn flavor. You also get 2 sides, in our case we got the mac & cheese which was rich and creamy, and the bacon wrapped jalapenos which didn't pack too much of a punch but had a great crispy bacon coating.  We got the bread pudding, which was soggy (I like it this way) studded with raisins. The ice cream helped to added another layer of richness and creaminess to the dish. Would get this again.  The Banana Pudding ($5.50) was a very large portion of vanilla pudding with loads of bananas and vanilla wafers. I think they folded in some whipped cream as the dish was actually somewhat light. Between the two desserts, this was the bigger hit.  Midwest Smokehouse puts out some good food which explains the lines and packed house. This is a solid choice to get your BBQ fix in Charlotte.",

The sauce, well, the namesake BBQ sauce is pretty good! It's a little thinner than I'm used to, but I dig it.  The hush puppies, friggin amazing. Where I'm originally from, hush puppies aren't a thing. They should be ,though, as long as they're always as good as the ones you get here. Fantastic, best pups I've ever had!  Everything else is kind of average. I've had BBQ a lot of places (there is a pulled pork sandwich in my life that I get actually emotional about every time I have it). Most of the reviews would lead you to thinking the BBQ here is that good. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but I've had a lot better Q in my day.  This place gets insanely busy. Be prepared to have a backup plan if you're trying to come here at peak hours.  We've been a couple times now, if you're really craving BBQ this will do. I'm going to give some other places a shot for now.",

I would definitely order the brisket over the pork but they were both good and the barbecue sauce wasn't that bad either. I prefered the glaze on the brisket better both their sauces. They have a good selection and the staff was super helpful in making good choices. Although some of the sides were a miss, I can't wait to go back because overall barbecue is all about the meat.",

I was looking forward to try some Carolina bbq and this place delivered far beyond my expectations! My friends and I split a couple of \"pig out\" platters with pulled pork, brisket, St Louis ribs, sausage, and burnt ends...everything was delicious. The sides were super tasty as well: hushpuppies, mac n' cheese, baked beans (yum!), creamed corn, and the best smoked veggies I've ever had. The hosts were friendly and accommodating and Taylor, our server, was knowledgeable, attentive, and provided awesome local beer and bourbon recommendations. Midwood Smokehouse has  become a must-visit everytime I'm in the Charlotte area.",

We walked in on a busy Sunday and were advised that a seat at the bar would be the fastest way to food. We were warmly greeted and ordered sweet tea as we browsed the menu. The tea was perfectly syrupy sweet and we received our meals shortly after ordering. I ordered the Carolina pork plate with bacon wrapped jalapenos, fries, and hush puppies. My boyfriend had the Cuban and the BBQ slaw. After we received our meal a refill was hard to find, which as I ate jalapenos was annoying. The food was good, I found I am just not a fan of \"dressed\" pulled pork. I prefer to add my level of sauce. Overall it was tasty and very reasonably priced. We'd visit again.",

The BBQ was melt-in-your mouth good, and the hush puppies and collard greens were excellent. They serve the best sweet potato fries we've ever had. We also enjoyed a local hard cider (or two) with our meal. Even our hard-that-please teen & tween were impressed with this place. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",

    "text": "Ok so I heard about this place, saw the high score with a lot of reviews and I was super excited to visit. Arrived on a Saturday afternoon and they were really busy. Place my order at the bar. Service was good for takeout. Although I wasn't staying, the atmosphere seemed cool. I ordered the ribs (sauced) with mac and cheese and baked beans. Oh yeah, I also got an extra side of creamed corn. On my first visit to places, I like to get several options. My hope is that at least one is a winner that gives me that gotta go back feeling. Well this one was a bust. The creamed corn was awful. It seemed to be fresh whole kernel corn with some sort of cream base added to it. I'm a southern girl. Fresh corn cut off the cob there is a natural milk that can be scraped off the cob to get a cream base if you are somewhat of a cook. Lol. The Mac and cheese was baked but it was just a step above that kiddy cheesy Mac that are in the commercials. The only reason I know it was baked it because it had that brown baked cheese topped crust which can be sooo good. This one had a charred tasted. The baked beans were the best of the sides but just ok. I could taste a tomato base. I'm just not a fan of tomato based baked beans. And finally the ribs. They are definitely smoked and seem to be slow cooked since they had no problem coming off the bone. Not the best ribs that I've tasted but I did enjoy them. All in all it didn't leave me with the feeling that I had to get back there and get back there soon. 2.5 stars would have been better but not so good that I was willing to round up to 3, so I'm leaving it at 2 stars.",

That being said, if you do love bbq this place is 5 stars for sure!  We went a few weeks ago and after a short wait were seated.  My husband and our friend each ordered a beer that was reasonably priced, I stuck to soda.  We then promptly ordered the pimento cheese fries as an appetizer because we're fat kids and they sounded delicious.  They arrived and bonus! were topped with delicious pulled pork.  I could have eaten just this as my dinner.  We chose some sort of meat and sides extravaganza that was more than enough for 3.  We chose the bacon wrapped jalapenos and mac and cheese as sides, both were excellent.  The meats were great too and the mustard based bbq sauce was by far my favorite.  If you're in plaza midwood and craving bbq, definitely make a stop here!",

Go for the Brisket and Beer Specials!   So I've been twice, and if I cared not about my waste line it would probably be more. First of all you gotta start with the pimento cheese fries, why? two words: pulled pork. Yes they hook it up. I am actually really embarrassed that I ordered them because I am not a fry person. The roommate wanted them so I ordered them. A Must have!  As far as BBQ goes it is all smoked to perfection, unlike the other \"M\" place. Brisket is the best hands down, then ribs, chicken, pulled pork. It really is all good and the sauces aren't something you really need. The meat has such good flavor without it, but you know the mustard sauce is bang'n. Midwood has solid sides as well, tried them all.  I have never had a bad server and that bartender that looks like an all-growned-up Bobby Hill is so sweet! Great people all around. See you soon!",

There were a few things I was disappointed in, however, one of which being the habanero barbeque sauce they had. I am a fan of all things spicy, and I was expecting a pretty big kick from the sauce. I was disappointed that the sauce was actually extremely mild with hardly any spice at all. Also, the smoked vegetables were not really that flavorful and had kind of an odd taste to it. All in all, I will definitely come back because I had very few complaints about the place. The jalepenos were also delicious :)",

It was extremely noisy and I was seated in the corner facing the wall which didn't help the perception of how long we waited. Moving on... We ordered the brisket and the smoked chicken. My partner said the sauce was just ok and the beans were terrible. I tried them to see if she was overly critical and have to agree. I don't know what they were thinking when they paired the flavors for the beans. This taste was definite not Texas BBQ. The smoked chicken was also just ok. It tasted as if it had been boiled and then smoked for a very short time. The \"smoked\" veggeis were grilled not smoked. Service was mediocre at best. Again IT WAS NOISEY!!! Suggestion: Get rid of the multiple TV screens (or turn the off) and turn off the canned music, and have some good live music to keep people entertained if you make them wait. And pay the musicians! All in all food just OK, service mediocre, atmosphere thumbs down!",

The smoked meet is still great and the sides have vastly improved.  Being a Mac n Cheese fan, their's is definitely up there.  The most recent visit I had one of the most delicious sandwiches ever.  It was a burger made from ground smoked brisket, topped with pepper jack cheese and a healthy serving of pulled pork.  I actually can't stop thinking about how good it was.",

You can get lean, fatty, or mixed, mine was the mixed. It was very tender and had just the right amount of tasty fat!!! Mac and cheese as a side was baked, not just macaroni and cheese sauce. It was very good. There is a large beer list and many choices of bourbon if that's your thing. Definitely gets a return visit if I visit Charlotte again.",

    "text": "I always stumbled a bit when someone would ask me about my favorite place to go for BBQ in town, but I have to say Midwood unexpectedly has given me an answer.  The brisket is amazing (definitely for Charlotte, but even compared to all the Texas brisket I've consumed in my life), the mac n cheese is delish, and you can't go wrong with bacon wrapped jalaps and crispy hushpuppies. The staff steered me away from the pulled pork both times - so I went with the ribs on my second trip - pretty darn good. (I'm trying it next time, though) Lots of side options, but I remember them being a little light on the veg entree options. The Midwood bbq sauce is my current fave, but their mustard sauce is tasty as well. (I still have not come to love carolina vinegarness, so I didn't even try theirs)  Decent beers on tap, lots of whiskey options, and great patio space. The staff is super friendly, though the bartenders may have asked if we were okay a handful too many times. (A little hard to eat if every 30 seconds I have to respond to the question) Pretty speedy service at lunch, looking forward to returning.",

    "text": "Having reintroduced pork into my diet, I couldn't wait to try out Midwood Smokehouse. A couple of friends and I went over there on a Saturday night, and due to the lovely weather which allowed the patios (yes, there are two - one upstairs and one downstairs) to be open, we only had a 15 minute wait. We sat at the bar and discussed the food options with the bar tender. By the time we sat down we were all ready to order.  We started with a basket of hush puppies because this is a BBQ joint - you have to start with hush puppies. And they did not disappoint. Dipped in the delicious BBQ sauce with a nice outside crunch and soft interior. Delish.   I ordered the small pork platter with mac-and-cheese (once again because it's a BBQ joint and you've got to have some mac-and-cheese). Good thing I ordered the small! There was enough food on my plate to feed at least two, possibly three, people. And more hush puppies on the side. The pork was so delicious with the spicy BBQ sauce that I barely tapped into the mac-and-cheese and didn't even touch the extra hush puppies.   Service was quick and efficient, and we never got to the bottom of our drink glasses. Parking can be a bit tricky as the lot is small and the place seems to always be hopping, but that will not deter me. I will definitely be back for more, Midwood. And soon.",

    "text": "Well, color me impressed. Midwood Smokehouse was really, really good! It's sitting at a 4.5 stars for me right now, but I imagine it will jump to 5 in no time.   Not that I'm surprised, frankly...because Frank Scibelli seems to have the magical touch when it comes to delicious and well-formulated restos in Charlotte. It's a great location (parking can be tricky) with wonderful, friendly service and tons of tasty items on the menu. Here are just a few things I tasted...  1) Pork platter: 4.5/5: Succulent, tender and delightful. This pork platter rivals Mac's, in my opinion. The meat is very smokey - due to the fabulous smoker they purchased for this establishment. But it's a good kind of smoke, no Liquid Smoke here.   2) Hush puppies: 4/5: Crispy outside, soft inside and damn good.   3) Sweet potato fries: 3/5: Good fries but paled in comparison to the other decadence on the table.   4) Bacon wrapped jalapenos: 4/5: Not nearly as hot as you'd think but a really flavorful starter. Make sure you eat one that has the bacon all crisped up. No one wants sad, soggy bacon.  5) Queso with barbecue: 4/5: Um, I love queso. I also love pork barbecue. Put them both together and voila! Instant amazing app.   6) Banana pudding: 5/5: Hell to the yeah. Homemade deliciousness. With vanilla wafers. This is the real deal and you must order it. I don't care how full you are.   I have a big ole smokey crush on Midwood Smokehouse. Looking forward to going back and checking out the patio!",

I live 5 minutes away and order would be ready on arrival or very soon, even when busy.  Best BBQ in town by far.  Knew me by name. But as got busier they cared less.  Now new policy is  call-in orders go to bottom of priority list.  Took 50 minutes to prepare and serve my one dish I called in from road.  Meanwhile I watched guests arrive, wait for table, get seated, order and eat appetizers, get 2d round of drinks, order and get dinner.  Bar maid proud of anti-takeout policy.  Bragged been that way forever, but she seemed new.  Not ever going again.  Poor service and strange (greedy?) policy.",

    "text": "Dare I say it? Midwood Smokehouse has the best barbecue I've had inside Charlotte's city limits.  I know, I know, that's not a bold claim to make, but the barbecue here is seriously good. This is four-star barbecue, my friends. The pulled pork is tender and juicy, although I think a lot of that juice comes from the vinegar sauce it's dunked in. In addition to a vinegar-based sauce, there's also a mustard-based sauce and a more traditional KC-style sauce, which are all pretty solid.  But as good as the barbecue is (and, trust me, it's pretty damn good), the real stars here are in the other parts of the menu. The smokehouse veggies are as good as veggies cooked for hours in a smoker should be. The macaroni and cheese is the real stuff with the crust on top and lots of cheesy goodness. And the chopped salad? Could be one of my favorite salads in Charlotte. Tons of fresh veggies including smoked corn cut off the cob. Let me say that again. SMOKED CORN CUT OFF THE COB.  But there are two things that bump this up from a four-star, solid barbecue joint review, into OH-EM-GEE, THIS IS WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF: The pimento cheese fries and the Kentucky Slush Puppy.  The pimento cheese fries are just what you'd expect -- crinkle-cut fries smothered with melted pimento cheese, a mound of pulled pork and just enough green onion for some bite. Yes, this will give me a heart attack, but it will be worth it.  And the Kentucky Slush Puppy is a grownup slurpee made with lemonade and bourbon. Yes, that's right. A bourbon slurpee. Thank you, Midwood Smokehouse.",

Based off the reviews I checked it out (I had a rental car, you would definitely need to drive if you are staying in downtown). I got carry out as I was by myself but it looked like they had a lot of good local beers on tap I would have liked to try. I got the Carolina Pork and it was really good. The pork was tender and the sauce was just right - the vinegar wasn't too strong at all. The hushpuppies that came with it were REALLY yummy. The pork and those alone would have been enough for me I realized after I started eating but the small came with one side. I got the sweet potato fries and they gave me what seemed like a pound of them. They were good but I barely made a dent in them because the pork and hushpuppies were way too yummy. They have a place at the bar to order specifically for carry out but then didn't really have an area to sit and wait. The bar was full of patrons so I had to stand and wait for my food. I didn't have to wait too horribly long but it was still odd that they didn't have a  waiting spot.",

Thumbs up: server Ev (short for Evan.....a young woman) was patient, pleasant and very helpful. Prices were in line with a BBQ joint.  Thumbs down: the food is mediocre so not sure where the high star reviews are coming from?? Perhaps, when you only have fast food to compare it to then this stuff seems like a night out on the town with the Mrs. Brisket lacked a defined smoke ring and flavor, pulled pork was bland, chicken dry and ribs were decent. All of the meats and rest of the food was salty. They have three sauces and only one was decent. The NC vinegar sauce and the mustard sauce were nasty. Sides were frozen crinkle cut french fries, small dry hush puppies, etc. The menu has too many off shoots from traditional BBQ, which should have been my first clue. Go to Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix, J Muellers or Franklins in Austin and you will see what real BBQ is. If you can't eat the meat without sauce and absolutely love it.....then it just sucks, plain and simple. Seems more like a bar than a real BBQ joint. Got sick from the food. Total waste of money taking a taxi to and from the airport during a layover for this!!! In fairness, I would say if you like bar food it is OK, but nothing special at all and certainly not worth a $40 round trip taxi fare.  Keep it simple and to the basics. If you can't make great BBQ then shut it down....please do not throw stuff on the menu like tacos, bacon wrapped jalapenos, etc. All you are doing is trying to mask your sub par meats (which should be the highlight. QUALITY ALWAYS WINS!!!!  And this ain't quality. It's BBQ Bar Food",

The St Louis ribs tasted real good but they were dry. The pulled pork was dry too, which is unforgivable! Amend that even the cole slaw was dry, the worst slaw I ever had.

I stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and by 12:15, there were just six seats at the bar left open. I started off with a regional craft beer, MW serves a good amount of regional stuff along with 1.50 PBR drafts on Saturday. Be sure to look at the board behind the bar for drink and food specials and if anything is 86'd.  I went with the brisket sandwich special w/ bleu cheese and red onions. I got a side of mac n cheese with it for 8 bucks. The sandwich comes on texas toast and is loaded up rather nicely. While I've had better brisket in Kansas City, I'm tipping my hat to Midwood on what looks to be a winning combination for a long time to come.   I'll be back to visit the food and friendly bar staff again!",

Everything smelt so wonderful, and looked so tasty. Afraid of my past BBQ experiences, I played it safe and went for the smoked turkey plate: hickory smoked and dressed wtth cranberry apple relish, and a side of that creamy mac n cheese! It was AMAZING. The atmosphere was relaxed, the beer selection is fine, and the staff is friendly.  Since my first visit I have been back twice, and have tried variations of the BBQ. I found that I love the vinger style sauce on anything! The only reason I do not go back more often is the wait to be seated can be lengthy, and the wait to get your food and drink refills can also be lengthy. The last time we were there we saw our waitress three times, once to take our drink order, once to take our food order, and once to bring us our check. A food runner brought us our food and passerby employees who saw our drinks were empty would bring us more drinks. Every visit I have had, has been a long one. But when I leave my face is still smiling because my belly is happy.",

We live in Elizabeth so this was a nice walk and very convenient.  I was impressed with the resume of restaurants from the owners and have some favorite menu items at Paco's and Cantina... so I was eager to try this one.  Service gets an A.  Kimberly was tending bar and was on top of her game.  Bubbly personality and very attentive to all of the patrons at the bar.  My wife immediately was impressed and she had the wow factor that a good bartender needs.  Remembered names, what we were drinking and above all, extremely friendly.  The other gentleman at the bar was less on his game and seemed stressed by the job and was forgetful with requests from patrons on our half of the bar.  Draft beers were upwards of $5-$6 per pint and the liquor drinks were $7-$10 per drink.  A bit high but trending standard fare for the neighborhood bars these days.  We ordered the smoked wings which were okay... Not very meaty for wings but had good smokey flavor.  Sauce options were sides which was different but still good.  We had the South Carolina style BBQ sauce which was actually more like a honey mustard.    We each had two drinks and shared the wing app at the bar.  Total bill w/ 20% tip was right at $40.    I'm hoping the other reviews on right on the pork.  Our next round we will go with an entree.  We would tend to head to Mac's for this but we want to support the local Plaza Midwood area.",

I had a hard time believing they wouldn't have a wait at 7pm on a Saturday night but that's what they told us so there we went. We walk in and are told there is a 45 minute to one hour wait and that it was pretty normal. I don't mind waiting for seating. I expect it on a Saturday night. But don't lie to me to get me to come there. We had plans for later so had to go somewhere else. If they will lie to a customer about a wait time what else will they lie about to get your money.

    "text": "I travel to Charlotte occasionally for work, and it had been about a year and a half since my visit last week. Every time I visit, I'm reminded of two things (1) Authentic southern food is incredibly underrated, and (2) the service in the south blows service I've had anywhere else out of the water. The place to remind me of both of those things on this visit was Midwood. I left borderline uncomfortably full but wondering whether I could have eaten even more without serious discomfort. The food here is that good.  I've had some tasty brisket in my life. However, my brisket evaluation scale is now irreversibly warped, with Midwood being a \"10\" and the next best maybe approaching a 6. The pulled pork, too, was so much better than any I'd ever had, including that from Revival (an acclaimed Southern-style restaurant in Minneapolis) that I consider to be top-notch. Both the brisket and pork are the perfect combination of tender, juicy, and flavorful. This place obviously takes a tremendous amount of pride in cooking and preparing pulled meats. Perhaps I'm just awestruck due to my lack of experience with delicious southern cuisine, but needless to say, I highly recommend it.  I was too distracted by the awesomeness of the brisket and the pulled pork that I really didn't pay much attention to the mac and cheese and baked beans I had as sides, but I remember them being excellent. Especially the baked beans.  As for service, the food did take a while, but our server was pleasant, charming, and checked back on us at the perfect frequency. She appeared to genuinely enjoy her job and made it her goal to ensure that we left with smiles on our faces. I really, really wish she could teach servers in Minneapolis how to treat patrons. I will be back the next time I'm in the CLT!",

They recently changed the finishing sauce to a cola type which brings the sweet flavor to the smokey taste. I have to rate these BE as one of my all time favs! Also had the ribs which were smoked just right and had the competition quality pull from the bone along with the great taste. Do not miss these two meats when you go. We ordered 2 sides - Baked MAC n Cheese which literally melted in my mouth, along with collard greens. Both southern side staples.  If you like BBQ and are in Charlotte Midwood Smokehouse is a must stop!  FYI - parking is tight in all of Plaza Midwood so plan ahead.",

Chicken was very tender. Ribs were meh. The meat was a bit tough and quite salty. The coleslaw was very good. Chopped finely and not too overbearing on the vinegar taste. Baked beans were meaty and the bbq was strong in it.  The chicken tenders are good but overly breaded- according to the kids.  Pecan cobbler was excellent.  Decent dining with bar atmosphere. Perfect place to hangout or for drinks. Attentive waitstaff.  Not sure if I will come back for the ribs. Maybe to try the salmon or have another warm slice of pecan cobbler.",

Midwood had an extensive BBQ selection, including burnt ends. Here's a tip: If you go to a BBQ joint that offers burnt ends, you know you're at a legit smoke shop. I ordered the full rack of ribs and added a side of burnt ends. My ribs also came with BBQ slaw and bacon-wrapped jalapenos. The ribs were amazing. Perfect amount of smoke. The meat came off the bone with almost no effort, but they weren't \"fall off the bone\" (which is great because really, who wants their rib meat to fall off into their lap or onto the plate?). This place also caters to the gluten-free crowd with a dedicated gluten-free menu. Even the bacon-wrapped jalapenos were gluten free as they were not breaded!  The burnt ends were delicious. I treated them as an extra appetizer. They easily could have been a meal.  I can't imagine any BBQ restaurant in Charlotte being better than Midwood. The wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our waitress also gladly did individual checks for all 8 of us without adding a gratuity. It probably worked out to her advantage that there wasn't a mandatory 18% gratuity, as I know my table far exceeded that.  Hands down, the best meal I had during my two weeks in Charlotte",

Many will debate that. However, I'm sorry Mac's Speed Shop, while your portions are much larger than Midwood, the quality, sauces and flavor are a notch below Midwood. Midwood succeeds at providing more than just good BBQ. They dish out great service, in an upbeat atmosphere complete with TVs and a full bar. It's a great place to come for a work lunch, on a date, with friends or for a celebration. They have plenty of local beers on tap, too, which bodes well with good BBQ.  I travel for a living, eat out three times a day more than 300 days a year and have been to more than 300 BBQ restaurants in the country (it's probably more like 500) so I'm holding a high bar comparing Midwood to the country's best. It's very good. And, when we're in Charlotte it's where we take friends and family if the word \"BBQ\" is mentioned. Hands down, if you're from Charlotte and haven't eaten BBQ consistently elsewhere, you'll definitely be blown away here. Everything is done well. From the meats, to dessert and sides, there's nothing that disappoints. In fact, even the hush puppies impress, which is hard to do.   Nevertheless, to be a 5-star, it must be one of the best BBQ places in the US and while it's darn close, it's one notch away from reaching the amazing BBQ you'll get a the Pompous Pig in Anderson, Smokin Pig near Clemson, Melvin's in the Charleston area, Louella's in Asheville, etc. I believe it's slightly better than a known Southern chain such as Jim N Nicks and blows away places like Smokey Bones and Sticky Fingers. Don't even bring up Sonny's and Dickey's. Midwood owns those places. In short, you need to eat here. It'll become one of your favorite places in Charlotte.   Deciding what to order isn't a chore, as long as you choose a combo platter, where four meats wind up on your plate. I'm not a big rib guy, so we normally split the Well Fed (feeds 2) or the Pig Out (feeds 3) and opt for the brisket, Hickory Smoked Sausage, Carolina Chopped Pork and Chopped Chicken BBQ. Consider that you are splitting this with another or two others and it's a great deal. Don't be discouraged, the St Louis Style Pork Ribs are good. I took my friends on a BBQ tour through the Carolinas and they enjoyed these ribs almost as much as a few of the above mentioned places. Another thing to consider is they do daily specials, too, such as Pork Burnt Ends, yum.   The two sides can be a challenge to pick. All are good. But, we are partial to two: smoked veggies and bacon wrapped jalapenos. Damn, these are good! If you've been to the Smokin Pig, the sweet potato fries here aren't as good, but they are much better than any you'd order at a normal restaurant and the greens are top-notch.  Another thing I like about Midwood is the range of available sauces. Rather than solely vinegar, like many places in Carolina they offer an assortment, which keeps everyone happy. All their sauces, South Carolina Mustard, Eastern NC Vinegar, Midwood Signature & Spicy Habanero are tasty and done well.   As for dessert, we've only tried the banana pudding. If you can fit any in your stomach after the large portions you ate already, give it a try. While Alabama's Dreamland continues to serve the best banana pudding, theirs is memorable, too.",

    "text": "Just within a few hours of my arrival to Charlotte, I received a few strong recommendations to try out Midwood Smokehouse, so obviously I had to check it out.   Pimento Cheese Fries: Large dish of fries piled high with a generous amount of melted cheese on top with pork. How can you possibly go wrong with ordering this dish? It was absolutely delicious and addictive, a dangerous combination. Highly recommend this dish.  Burnt Ends with side of bacon wrapped jalapenos, hushpuppies and pickled onions: Brisket was on the dry side and a bit difficult to chew. Did not have enough bbq sauce on it. The texture of the jalapenos were too soft/soggy and nothing special--just literally jalapenos wrapped with bacon with no seasoning or flavors that I tasted. Hushpuppies were good and the pickled onions were a necessity to balance out the meat. Not my first choice to recommend.  Half Rack of ribs with sauce: Again, the pork was dry, but it did taste good though.  I'm no bbq specialist, but I think I had my fair share of very good bbq. Overall, I found this place alright. The service was excellent.",

I ordered the small plate brisket which includes the hush puppies, pickled onions (yummm) and one side- I ordered the BBQ Baked Beans & I also had the banana pudding. I had it delivered via postmates - it said the wait would be about an hour to have it delivered but I got the food within 35-40 mins. When I received the food, it was heavenly. The entire meal felt like it just came out of the kitchen & was the perfect temp. The meal was superb & omg the desert! It's delicious but very rich so make sure to share it with someone! I can't wait to visit in person the next time I am in the mood for some good southern cooking!",

There are booths, hightops and regular tables as well as a really long bar with comfy seats.  A must-get is the bacon-wrapped jalapenos!!  VERY spicy, order your beer first, but for those of us that LOVE spicy food - this is for you!  They come out tender and the bacon is crispy and the cheese is the perfect amount of 'melty'.   I had the BBQ platter which I ordered with the BBQ Baked Beans.  The Q was super-smokey.  Totally done right, with sauce on the side.  The BBQ Baked Beans were a meal in themselves!  Very rich and the addition of peppers gives it a very full savory flavor.    Next time I am definitely going to get the brisket.  My boyfriend got it and i had to pull a 'look over there!  its Pam Anderson!' to snag a bit from his plate.  YUM.  It was so tender and flavorful - not too fatty which I love.    Definitely will head back - so glad we found this spot!  We owe it all to Yelp!  Thanks guys!  :-D",

    "text": "Over the last three years, I've been to Charlotte four times. Everyone raves about the BBQ, but until my most recent trip I'd never had the pleasure of trying it. Luckily for me, a local took me to Midwood Smokehouse last month.  We walked in the door and the smells from the kitchen told me we were in the right place. The smokey sweetness of BBQ made it hard to look at the menu because I really just wanted to eat.  I ended up getting a pulled pork sandwich and some sides. Good, tasty stuff. Friendly service. Prices were amazing compared to what I would've paid for back home. And, the atmosphere was low-key and nice.  Go back? Sure, next time I'm in Charlotte I wouldn't mind at all. I'll suggest it.",

Midwood does pulled pork right and their N Carolina sauce and S Carolina sauces are spot on.   I could speak extensively about the hushpuppies, mac 'n' cheese, or fries, but instead I will say that I am most pleased by the pickled onion. Genius.  Their barbecue chicken is great too, and as much as I philosophically disagree with Texas brisket, they do that well too.   If you like barbecue, you can't do better in Charlotte than Midwood.",

    "text": "I guess I'm a snob, or spoiled, I'm not sure. Probably both. I don't understand what the fuss is about. First the BBQ pork my son has was good..not great, but good. I thought that mac and cheese was pasty and lacked flavor. It was warm, nit hot but tasted like glue. The hush puppy's were good, though. Now, the brisket... I'm not from Texas and love me some pork BBQ  (Lexington is the gold standard) but this brisket was weak... The \"fall off the bone\" tender actually was mushy. It tasted like it was boiled or steamed before it hit the smoker. It had NO smoke ring and the smoke flavor seemed to be artificial. I ordered mixed fatty and lean, as I know fatty is the way to go. It was actually greasy, not the luscious melted fat of a well smoked brisket. The \"bark\" was soggy and was overly salty. Again I think it had liquid smoke or smoked salt. or something. No spice or depth of flavor. Again the meat was \"unnaturally\" tender. steamed or boiled or maybe a \"meat tenderizer\" was added. A bright pink smoke ring should show on a brisket this thick, but none was apparent.  Needless to say, I was disappointed, especially at $10 for a small plate (1 side).  I'll give them another shot, but anyone how gives this place 3 stars or better doesn't know what they are talking about when it comes to Q! If it hadn't been or first visit I don't know if I would have given it 2 stars.  Oh, yea, service was good to excellent, no complaints there.",

I had the Texas style brisket yesterday and it was to die for.  No knife necessary, most tender brisket I've ever eaten at a barbecue joint.  The bacon wrapped jalepenos are delicious.  The first time I had them they were very spicy ad second time not as much. (I preferred the spicier version).  Smoked vegetable special was divine--portabellas, squash, onion, and more cooked in their custom made smoker to perfection.  The smoke flavor brought out the meatiness in the fresh veggies without overwhelming them.  Will definitely be visiting Midwood Smokehouse regularly.  Brisket is a must.",

Midwood did an excellent job balancing the wood flavors in the preparation of their meat.  Carolina style barbecue is typically served in a vinegar sauce.  They chose to provide the vinegar sauce on the side, so I could choose to regulate the amount of vinegar flavor in my barbecue.  They also provided a slightly sweetened vinegar sauce, So I was not dipping my meat into pure vinegar.  I have been to many backwoods Carolina barbecue restaurants that just soak their meat in pure vinegar.  Terrible stuff.  Thankfully, Midwood does not do this.  They let the meat and the smoking process provide the flavor.  The vinegar sauce is not acidic and mild enough to enhance the flavor.  It is one of the best barbecue restaurants that I have visited in the US.",

Not what I am used to as far as the sauce, but great flavor, cooked right,  and nicely presented (ribs were neatly stacked up).  Had collard greens and they were delicious.   The only negative, I wasn't hungry enough to try one of the combo plates (since there were plenty of warnings that it was a lot of food).   Nice place, nice atmosphere, and very good Q.

The same company does this app at Paco's Tacos and Tequila in South Park, the difference being that at Midwood, they remove the seeds, so that you may actually enjoy the flavor. The bacon was on the chewy side, but the flavor was right. Then again, it seems hard to mess up anything w/ Bacon, Cheese, and Jalapenos. Being of small frame, I thought it best to jump right into their \"North Carolina BBQ\" before I filled up on apps. I must say, it was very,very good. I opted for the vinegar based sauce, but there are other options. Honestly, it didn't need sauce, it was done properly. That is to say, it really is authentic, slow smoked BBQ. As far as ambiance, service, and all the other fixins, I'll just say, It's a BBQ joint, I didn't expect much, and was not disappointed. I have been back, and will go again.",

    "text": "New to Charlotte & searching for good BBQ, natch! Been to Mac's a few times & really enjoyed it! Thought we'd check out Midwood Smokehouse just for variety, and we so wished we hadn't! Decided to go the take-out route, our first mistake. The call-in for the order went smoothly, or so we thought. Were told our order would take 20-30 minutes. Got there with a bit of time to spare. My husband continued to get updates on its progress....'it's coming,' they said, the kitchen is just a little backed up.'  In the end, an hour plus later & we're still waiting, they confess the order was never being worked on because the ticket was lost or mishandled somehow. Not certain where the drop in communication is, on the part of the kitchen or the order-taker, but there appeared to be much confusion. So after approx 1 1/2 hours, they really started to put together our order, and here we are waiting again. Finally, my husband starts walking to the car, take-out bag in hand, only to have some guy wildly running after him & calling out 'wait, we gave you the wrong bag!' All I can say is wow. How inept. We were so hoping our minds would be changed with some scrumptious BBQ! No such luck! The food was a huge letdown. Collard greens tasted like washed out grass, no flavor, just plain nasty. The chicken - well, let's just say, I make lots better. BBQ sauce, not our favorite. My husband thought the ribs were OK. I will admit the smoked veggies were pretty yummy. One small bright spot. After dropping $50, they offered to buy my husband a beer & our dogs some water. I believe we should have been comped this dinner, but that offer never came. Looks like the best revenge is simply throwing our business elsewhere. Mac's will continue to get our patronage. Just heard some good things said about Rock Store BBQ in Stallings. Both spots are supposed to have gotten the nod from The Travel Channel.",

This time we happen to be in Charlotte so we hit our trusty Yelp App and landed at this BBQ gem. Getting a 5 Star from me is extremely hard, but this spot hit all the marks. The Carolinas are suppose to be known for their bbq so I figure it was be solid, but this blew me away. Exploring the menu, they didn't have just your typical meats like Ribs, Pork, Chicken, and Brisket. They had all of them plus some BBQ pitmaster specialities sure as Burnt ends for Pork and Beef, along with some pulled chicken, but the thing was surprising was they had smoked salmon. That is something you just don't see at BBQ and let me tell you, it was cooked perfectly and tasted incredible. So between us ordered the Brisket which was cut from the Point, some pork burnt ends, Salmon, and Pulled Chicken. All were awesome. The sides were standard- they compliment the meat. The mustard bbq sauce was one of the best I have tried recently. I used the Carolina vinegar sauce for my Collard.   All in all a great experience.",

I think my favorite would be the hush puppies! (We even ordered another side of them) I didn't care too much for the Mac and cheese- pretty mediocre and I probably wouldn't order them again.

And if you close your eyes, you'll swear you're listening to the radio. He has that kind of voice!  The food is amazing. I opted for chopped barbecue with creamed corn and greens. Food arrived super quickly and was hot...and delicious. We love Eastern NC style barbecue and they have \"our\" vinegar-based sauce to top your meat choice.   I wanted dessert but they didn't have wheelchairs. They have something called pecan cobbler that I will have to try on my next visit!",

I started off with a Bloody Mary, which was actually one of the best ones I've had! Like a classy lady, I licked off the entire glass's rim which was dipped in a delicious BBQ rub. We also shared the queso with pork - which was very good but we quickly ran out of chips. I'm a total brat when it comes to queso and chips when they don't give you enough chips to finish the appetizer.  The waitress was MIA for quite awhile, so we still had 3/4 left without chips and it went cold. That's a big no no in Texas.   I got the Carolina pork and Mac n cheese - which I would give 4 stars. It wasn't the best I had, but it was very good. My husband got the fatty brisket, which seemed \"wet\" versus moist - we both were NOT impressed. His potato fries weren't great either.",

I was at Midwood a couple weekends ago and they had a specialty drink cocktail - a Watermelon Fresca. I went back a few days later when family was in town, wanting to share one of our favorite places, and they didn't  have it anymore. I bought a watermelon hoping to make it at home but it just wasn't as good. Called Midwood and a very abrupt person on the phone said they don't give out recipes. Seriously?! It's a specialty cocktail you don't make all the time - it's not like I can come get one if I have the hankering - and you're not going to share? If you gave me the recipe, every time I make it for company, I'd likely say \"I got it at midwood smokehouse and they were so awesome they shared the recipe.\"... like... \"go there and eat... it's one of our favorite places.\" Poor showing, Midwood.",

We've always order the Big BBQ ( I think that's what it's called) because its for a larger party but its great because you can sample pretty much all the meats on the menu. I just think I'm a bit critical because I have had better BBQ.Its great for big or small groups and the location is ideal. This is one of those places where you can go out to dinner and then check out Plaza Midwood by foot, perhaps go bar hopping (like I  have in that area).",

I don't know how Midwood's chefs took the meat and turned it into this perfect art that delectably melts in your mouth. You can also order a side of bacon-wrapped jalapenos, which are delicious and spicy!  Midwood also has a plethora of stuff on tap, including the local brews for those of you, like me, enjoy sampling the hometown fare.  The service and atmosphere was fantastic! Bright and warm to the point where you'll never want to leave.  You also have never tried pork until you've had their Carolina Pork. With locally made vinegar, that stuff is awesome!

The experience did not disappoint. Patrons are seated by the hostess and it's a full service dining experience. I was really hungry - I ordered the large Carolina pork plate and a pound of smoked wings. The plate was a good deal with generous portion size for $13+tax. The smoked wings didn't seem like quite as good of a value at $8+tax, but still an ok deal. Everything was served piping hot. The hushpuppies were a bit tough. The mac and cheese was spectacular, great flavor. I tried their smoked vegetables (squash, zucchini, peppers) which had good flavor/seasoning, and are a nice option to offer. The pulled pork was juicy with very little fat. The vinegar based sauce did not add much flavor to the meat, but I don't think it needed sauce to dress it up, seemed good as is. The wings were ok, the BBQ sauce on them seemed to be different from the sauce on the table, more tomato based and did have a slight bit of a peppery kick. I'd like to try them again with the ranch instead. I topped it off with the pecan cobbler with ice cream, which is probably a little overpriced at $5.50+tax. The pecans were a little over-cooked for my taste, it seemed like too much of a burnt flavor.   This place was hopping during the middle of dinner time on a weekday night. Their outdoor seating was comfortable given the pleasant temperature during my visit. I definitely want to come back and try out some of their other menu options.",

Classic Sammy Haggar.  Manager was an awesome guy.   Very limited parking.   Great beer selection.   Good service. Beers promptly refilled.   Fatty brisket was amazing. Could pull it apart with a fork. Not a lot of flavor from the bark. Definitely not a salt /pepper rub.   Sausage was fantastic.  Hard to explain vs traditional BBQ joint sausage.  Amazing with the brown mustard.   Pulled chicken was amazing. Loads of flavor and very juicy and tender.  Pulled and dressed with the vinegar-based sauce.   Pork didn't overwhelm me.  That was the one thing I was expecting to be good.   They were out of the St. Louis style BBQ ribs. :(  I'm giving the food 3 stars and the atmosphere takes it to 4 stars.",

I don't know if it was a good dish done bad, or a bad dish done good, but I found it quite unappealing. I guess I've been spoiled on KC, StL and Texas BBQ all these years. However, the baked beans were a wonder, and almost deserving of an additional star themselves. The neighborhood seems quite trendy. I'm sure I can find some better eats in the area next time.",

I requested the grilled cheese with smoked vegetables as a side.  The server asked, \"are you sure you don't want meat with that?  We are known for our meat.\"  To which I replied, \"I am known for not liking meat.\"  I guess he was supposed to push the meat.  And also,  he mam'd me to death.  I don't enjoy being called ma'am, but it's everywhere.  Call me babe or hottie instead. The food took a while to arrive.  My husband thought that maybe his food sat for a while.  My vegetables needed salted and peppered, which was an easy fix.  The sandwich was a bit thin on the cheese, but I was so happy to have bread.  I never eat bread, and Texas Toast was a treat. We enjoyed the 80's playlist and had fun trying to guess the artists. It was a nice, ordinary evening.",

My husband and I went there with our church one Sunday after service. We had a large party and would have had to wait quite a bit to be seated if we sat inside, so they took us out to the heated patio and sat us there instead. The weather wasn't bad, so it worked out well.   My husband was on a no-sugar diet at the time, so it was a bit difficult to find food that he could eat, but they were very accommodating, and our server made sure to double check that what he ordered was okay for him to eat. We did end up cheating a bit with the jalopenos but it was definitely worth it.   Whenever he can eat like a normal person again, we'll definitely revisit. Since going there, we've made our own version of bacon-wrapped jalopenos at home - but using goat cheese since he can't do cow's milk dairy - and they were pretty good. Nothing beats the app at Midwood though.",

    "text": "Just visited this gem last night with my family and there's a 150% chance that we'll be back! My mom heard about Midwood on one of those cooking shows that she watches so she wanted to check it out. Needless to say, 2 years passed and we still hadn't even looked the place up yet. We finally committed to coming yesterday and were met with the most unimaginable aroma of woodchips and spices- we were outside waiting and I just couldn't wait to get my hand on some of this food!  We had the smoked wings for an appetizer and I have to say that those were the best wings I've had in Charlotte. We ordered our sauces on the side and I'm not very sure what all of them were but my favorite was the habanero. I had the Carolina pork plate with smoked vegetables and I honestly kicked myself for not ordering the large plate. The pork was so moist and seasoned to freaking perfection. The pickled onions paired with the meat perfectly and the hush puppies were fresh.  My mom ordered the rib special that's going on this week and she said that she wished she had ordered the whole rack instead of half! My father had the brisket and had no complaints (which is a VERY good thing).  My husband had the Cuban and he said it was really good. It was his first time having a Cuban so he didn't really have anything to gauge it on but it was really good from what I tasted. It's pretty safe to say that from a first experience this tasty, Midwood is definitely going to become a family staple for us.",

    "text": "5 Stars for their Brisket and in comparison to all other BBQ joints in Charlotte (keeping it in perspective)  Having traveled and lived in so many places across our great country, I've had the forture (or misfortune, depending on the experience) of trying a lot of different types of BBQ....from Texas, to St. Louis, to Georgia, Mississippi, Memphis, Kansas City, and now the Carolinas. All are delicious yet all have differences as well.   I would say Midwood Smokehouse if BY FAR the BEST BBQ for quality in Charlotte. In my (humble) opinion, this to me isn't True Carolina BBQ.....when you try the Brisket, it reeks of TEXAS-style BBQ. BUT my friends, THAT is why is so darned good! That Brisket is some of the best I've had outside of Texas, and trust me, when it comes to Beef BBQ, Texas is KING! I'm pretty sure the owners will tell you that they tried to emulate a Texas style for flavor and texture. I've been here 4 times, and each time I always get at least one sampling of the Brisket, and each time it has been outrageously great! Perfect smoke, flavor, and melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I just cannot find that anywhere else here in Charlotte.  IF you know of any place here in Charlotte that serves better BBQ Brisket, PLEASE let me know! The closest I've found is Saucemans on West Blvd. They're pretty darned good too, but not as good as Midwood Smokehouse.  I've also tried their sausage, pork and chicken, and I thought all of them were pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. Certainly no where as good as the Brisket.  I do love their jalapeno poppers too! Wrapped in BACON. Come on, how could you NOT like that?  I haven't been here in a few months but wanted to provide my perspective on this restaurant given that I've seen some really negative postings here recently. I mean it's cool that we all have our own tastes and experiences. God knows I've ripped a few here lately myself. But overall, in comparision to what we have here in Charlotte, I still believe this place to be THE BEST in town.  I wish we could do a Bobby Flay BBQ Throw Down here!",

Two of us split the Combo platter and at first glance, we were worried it wasn't enough for us but my gosh, it was enough and it was fantastic! The brisket is some of the best I've had in Charlotte at a BBQ place, the pulled pork was great, and the ribs were 'fall-off-the-bone-so-freaking-great' yum. We also got pork but it was covered in the mustard sauce that I don't like so I unfortunately didn't get to try it (I was a bit surprised that it came with sauce on it already and sad I missed out on it).   I really liked the hushpuppies and there are some things I am really looking forward to trying in the future, such as the BBQ Queso. That just sounds delicious.   I am happy I finally went and was very pleased. I can't wait to go back. Of my BBQ restaurants I've tried in Charlotte (and there's been a lot), this is top 3, maybe top 2!",

We arrived on a Friday around 11:15 AM to beat the lunch crowd and there were only a few tables seated.  Our waitress was great and helped us through the menu and local beer options (we told her that we were newbies).  Items that we ordered:  1) Bacon wrapped jalapenos - YUM and very spicy, nice kick and goes along with beer.  2) Pig Out - 4 meats - Turkey, Brisket, Ribs and Pulled Pork - WOW.  Simply amazing!  So much food we split it and brought the rest home for dinner.  One note the baked beans were probably the best ever (laced with meat).  Please check this place out if you have not tried it.  I found this restaurant on Yelp and appreciated the other reviews from the Yelp community.  You will not be disappointed and I look forward to going again!",

Burnt ends were a little dry, and I had much higher expectations for the Fat Tire sauce (which I could barely taste). The Carolina Pork sandwich wasn't bad, and I'm glad that we at least were able to get samples of all of their sauces to try with it. Echoing what Kenzie said, the sides were a bit disappointing, especially the dry mac and cheese, and bottles of sauce would have been nice/preferred.  I wish I'd been visiting longer so I could have had some more meals to really develop an opinion on Carolina BBQ beyond Midwood. I'm optimistic for my next trip back and subsequent BBQ trials...",

Coleslaw is so so.  Food prices seem mostly reasonable, with some  priced under $10.     Mixed drinks a little high.  Lots of beer choices.  Server was friendly, but not overly attentive.  The five stars is for the barbecue",

Mary was a fantastic server and I had the ribs (dry), mac & cheese and bacon-wrapped jalapenos. Tried all of there sauces and preferred the house mix and the habanero mix. My only mistake was in ordering the full rack as I had no room for desert.  After the meal Mary arranged for the manager to give us a tour of their hickory-fired smoker.  All in all a great meal and a very nice time.",

I lived in Houston for a couple of years and after tasting Midwood's brisket, I was immediately suspicious their might be a Texan in the kitchen - and I was right. Texas is not known for pulled pork and ribs - nope... it's all about the brisket and sausage. This place nails both and I love that they have an option of lean or fatty brisket.  This place might have the best 'cue in Charlotte, although my pallet is better suited for Mac's....",

The mac and cheese was supposedly pretty good.  The hush puppies were pretty awesome.  Table service was great.  We sat at a booth, which was comfortable.  They also had some high tops.  Four stars only because parking sucks.  The lot is way too small and you have to find another place to park if the lot is full.",

First, the ambience is perfect.  There are lots of TVs in the dining room allowing you to keep up on all of the games.  As for the food, I ordred a full slab of ribs...the BBQ was awesome.  On the side, I enjoyed the sweet potato fries and collard greens.   The back porch tea was really tasty (sweet tea, Jack Daniels and muddled lemon) C.J. was our waiter...he was very attentive and friendly.  The only downer is its location.  I was staying in a hotel downtown and it took about 10 minutes to get there.  Nevertheless, I would take a plane, train or automobile to get back to Midwood!",

We have taken all of our out of town guests here and had them cater our Christmas Eve dinner last year.   They smoke everything onsite andy ou can smell the meat cooking as soon as you step out of your car.  The bbq and brisket are fantastic and they have the best pulled chicken I've ever had.  They have a few sauces onhand so you can have thick, mustard or vinegar sauce to accompany your meal.   I love getting the Midwood Chopped Salad and I usually add the pulled chicken to it.  The salad is filled with grilled corn, black beans, avocado, cucumbers and freshly grated cheddar cheese. Another favorite meal to order are the tacos- you can mix and match so you can try bbq, pulled chicken and/or brisket at the same time.  The mac and cheese and creamed corn are out of this world.   Plan your visit now, you can't go wrong!",

I was told about the rave reviews received by this restaurant and was excited to eat here. I cannot explain how disappointed I was with this place.  The portions were tiny and the food had no flavor.   I ordered the pulled chicken. I received a scoop of meat that appeared to be barely the amount of a chicken thigh. It was pale and dry.   After I tried it, I told the waiter it was flavorless.  He said since the skin is pulled off, the flavor leaves with it.   First of all, you can season under the skin, as I do at home.   Secondly, if you let the chicken sit overnight after you've seasoned it, the meat picks up more flavor. Lastly, if you smoke it or BBQ it, the flavor permeates the meat.  Give me a break! What kind of BBQ spot is this? Dinosaur BBQ runs circles around this place! I will never, ever eat here again. Terrible!",

    "text": "for the sake of Charlotte knowing whats out there...this is one of my top places.    Midwood Smokehouse will probably ruin all other BBQ in the city for you...not much compares.  If there is a wait, go for it anyways...they will take your number and text you so you can leave the area as long as you are back within 5 minutes of their call.  I personally love that.  The Pimento Cheese fries will ruin your dinner in the most glorious of ways, so good, so big!  (ADD PORK)  The burnt ends are delish - as is the creamed corn.  My go-to meal is the simple Pork BBQ sandwich, with coleslaw on the sandwich - how it should be done!  Get the vinegar sauce and pour it all on!....I do a side of hush-puppies and love to dip them in their spicy BBQ sauce.  Great dinner that always leaves me wanting to roll out the door.    Thursdays are Bring Your Own Mug night - they will fill anything up to 40oz.  Very fun time and you can get really creative!  And if you like spicy do check out their Bloody Mary's!  ($5 on Sundays!)  They are really great.  The last few sips will leave your mouth burning...in a \"that was worth it\" kinda way.  I have a small list of Charlotte spots I take out-of-towners when visiting.  MW-SH is the TOP spot on my list for great NC BBQ.",

We use to live in the University area and we ate here all the time, but we moved to the other side of town and don't get here as often as we would like. So I was over here this week doing Father's Day shopping for my husband when I realize exactly where I was. I called my husband to get his order and made a quick beeline to the restaurant. Place our order and within 10-15 mins I was out the door. Now the hard part was driving from central ave to ballentyne with that great smelling flavor playing with my nose was the hardest part and often wanted to sneak in the bag and grab something out, but I didn't want anything unless I had the entire thing, so I waited.   Once I got home I don't remember taking the keys out the car because I was so excited about mid wood BBQ. When I took my first bit I almost slapped my husband because it was so good (joking) but it was good. It was just how remembered. On this round my husband got the wings app with Mac and cheese and collard, all that were great, and I got the pulled pork with collards, with was great.  I have had everything here and I recommend everything. Smoked sausage, wings brisket, pull pork everything is phenomenal.",

    "text": "Down home Carolina BBQ!  Carolina BBQ means pork. Pulled pork with a vinegar based sauce.  I'm a Texan, and I appreciate good BBQ. I seek it out. That's why I was so pleased to try Midwood Smokehouse. I was fairly clueless about Carolina style BBQ, and was excited when the waitress knew exactly what I should have when I said I wanted local style BBQ. They served me up two heaping spoonfuls of pulled pork, topped with onions, a side of hushpuppies, and bacon-wrapped jalapenos.  The bbq sauce was vinegar based, with spices and peppers sloshing around the bottom of the mix. I've never quite understood vinegar based sauces, but enjoyed the pickled pepper flavors  when mixed with the pork. Parts of the pulled pork had that char on it, or bark, which gave some pieces a smoky, crunchy quality.  The hushpuppies seemed like deep fried pieces of cornbread. They had a slight sweetness to the cornbread. Decent.  I wasn't wild about the bacon wrapped jalapenos. Being from San Antonio, we know our jalapenos, and these weren't the most primo peppers. On the small side, and overcooked so that they squish when you bite 'em. I was blown away by the beer list. They had a rare cask aged beer, and lots of local options for fine beer.  Unfortunately, they were out of a lot of items, so our selections were somewhat hampered.  The service was very friendly, and they made lots of great recommendations and carefully explained a little about everything we were eating. You could tell that they take pride in the BBQ here.",

    "text": "I've now been to Midwood Smokehouse three times, and the more I go, the more I like this place.  The first time I went here, it was during the middle of the week one day last summer, a little before noon.  I ordered the ribs and was not impressed.  They were full of smoky flavor, but they were tough and definitely NOT \"fall off the bone\".    The other two times I've had the chance to dine @ Midwood have been much more memorable and have both come within the past month.  In the two most recent times here, I ordered the half rack of the St. Louis style pork ribs ($13), the BBQ Pork Sandwich ($7.50), and the smoked wings ($8).  The ribs the second time around were much better and much more tender.  the BBQ pork sandwich, which I had Saturday, June 3rd, for lunch was nothing short of spectacular.  I asked for the slaw on the sandwich which added a nice, cool, crunchy texture.  The fries were above par as well.  On my most recent trip there, I ordered the wings as well.  The wings were awesome.  As a True wing lover and connoisseur, I have no hesitation in saying these are some of the tastiest, tender wings in Charlotte!  Every time I've been to Midwood the service has been great.  Every employee I've come in contact with while there, has been friendly, and polite.  I am not sure exactly where Midwood Smokehouse ranks in the pantheon of Charlotte BBQ establishments, but you have to put it somewhere in the top 5; behind Mac's, but waaay ahead of the likes of Old Hickory House.  Something tells me, this place is going to carve out a tradition of great BBQ and friendly service in the heart of the Plaza Midwood for years to come.  I am a growing fan of this spot and will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I've sampled my fair share of barbeque from many different styles up and down the east coast and out west as well and Midwood Smokehouse can definitely compete with these guys.   This place was already filling up 11:45 am on a Friday morning. It was a beautiful day so we snagged a spot on the outdoor patio and immediately start gawking at all the delicious-looking plates around us.  I decided on the blue cheese brisket sandwiched served between two pieces of Texas toast and the boyfriend ordered the half rack f rib special but substituted the BBQ spaghetti with mac n cheese.  The sauces same out way ahead of time from the food which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine especially when you are really anxious for your meal. Of course I sampled each one alone and new exactly which combination of each I like. The mustard-based sauce and then Midwood sauce were my favorites. We were surprised how long we had to wait for our meals as barbeque usually comes out pretty quick, but to be fair, they were pretty busy.  Everything was pretty darn good. The sweet potato fries were most impressive to me (I'm very picky about my fries) and the brisket sandwich was very good as well. The ribs were not necessarily \"fall off the bone\" but the smoky rub was outstanding. The mac n' cheese was nothing to swoon over.  Next time I come back I'll definitely need to try a traditional pulled pork BBQ sandwich along with the delicious sweet potato fries.",

I'm here for work and got the \"well fed\" you choose 4 meat and two sides. The ribs are tender and flavored to perfection. The burnt ends are a house favorite and they didn't disappoint. The sausage and the brisket were also incredible. Sometimes at other restaurants the brisket is dry or even too salty. This place does it very well. Lots of flavor without being too salty and it is not dry at all. The ribs were by far my favorite. For sides I got mac and cheese and jalapeno poppers. The mac and cheese is basic and didn't take my breath away but the jalapeno poppers were awesome! They take a huge one and wrap it with a full strip of bacon and I loved every bite! Come hungry for sure. The staff was incredible especially the lady at the bar. It was so good I came back again the next night. SOOOO GOOOD!!!!",

Cool vibe & real BBQ atmosphere; sat at the bar & had Matt as my server...he could not have been my gracious in helping with my selections & informing me of everything I needed to know about Midwood.  Had the 4 meats of ribs, burnt ends, pork & brisket. Though all were excellent, the brisket was incredible; perfect fatty/lean ratio, tender & the perfect char.    Sides were a unique option of bacon wrapped cheese stuffed jalapenos (very interesting & tasty) & quite honestly, one of the greatest things I've ever eaten in the baked beans. More like a chili, these beans were moan-worthy, seriously!  All four sauces were great; vinegar based Carolina style, my favorite was the traditional, watery base, followed by the mustard based.  For only a couple more bucks, Matt sold me on the banana pudding, which I ate after I got back to Atlanta for dessert...so creamy, light & yummy!  Thanks again to Matt & Preston at the bar, the assistant GM for checking in with me & the phenomenal pit master for a memorable BBQ experience in Charlotte.",

Service is always great and every staff member I've interacted with there has been friendly. Even the person managing the takeout orders is nice!  But let's get down to business. The food here is fantastic. They do a great Texas style brisket, which I highly recommend. If I'm feeling in a light mood, I will get the chopped salad and add brisket on top. It's delicious. Sides are great, and I would recommend the Mac and cheese. I know this is kind of random, but the sausage is really good too. It's one of those meets that comes as an afterthought to a lot of people, but put this at the top of the order next you go!  All in all, a great BBQ joint. Patio is nice in the spring and they turn tables fairly quickly so you do t have to wait too long. If I could leave you with one piece of advice, get the bacon wrapped jalapenos. You won't regret the taste and you can just ignore the calories.",

Came cause of the banana pudding comments but unfortunately that as well was just off. It seemed like just whip cream with wafers. I was really looking forward to it. But I like there to be a consistency difference between the pudding and whip cream. I seriously thought it was just whip cream. Taste was ok. Just left disappointed from start to finish.

Coming all the way from Baltimore to try charlotte's famous Carolina BBQ, serving warm meat at a BBQ spot is totally uncalled for. Regardless, neat location to dine grab a beer and watch football. It don't really have that BWW feel for a sports bar but it's a nice adjustment for decent BBQ.",

Total scam!! no less then 12 people got the same treatment while I was there. Looking up other reviews on this place, yes it's happened before. Now this may not be the fault of the restaurant, however they are not looking out for there customers. If my customers where getting this treatment would put up a sign do something. It goes along with serving your customers. I will never be back.",

Very flavorful although a tad salty.  Very much like a bushes baked beans but probably better.  The mustard bbq sauce reminded me so much of Maurice's BBQ Mustard that I grew up on when we had Sunday dinner but they have it spicy.  I may return but not floored.

We get there and the host told us that they are out of ribs and pulled pork. But thats what we came here for? But from what it looks like one of the owners said that those two items would be ready within 30 minutes. My buddy said lets just stay here only because it will probably take us that long to decide on where to go instead, then drive there, then sit, then order. SO we just said, lets just eat here.  We put our name down and asked for a booth, and they said there might be a wait, I said no problem because we had 30minutes to wait for the stuff we wanted anyways.  Our server, i forgot his name was really nice. We browse the menu and pretty much know what we wanted.  I ordered that plate that had a little bit of everything and my buddy just had the pulled pork.   We get our food fairly fast, it didn't even feel like we waited that long for anything. When I get my plate, everything looked amazing! The bacon wrapped jalepeno's was awesome. The baked beans was home made. the hush puppies i couldn't stop eating.  As for my meats. The thing i loved the most was the brisket. It was hands down the best brisket I have ever tried. My next favorite was the pulled pork, and the Ribs and sausage I did not care for. The ribs looked amazing but it fell flat for me in terms of flavor. The sausage was nothing really to write home about. Oh i forgot to mention i LOVED the pickled onions. Wish I got more on my plate.  But other then that, this place gets a solid 4 star in my book. I'll most defiantly be back when I'm in town again.",

The sweet potato fries were so crisp, definitely the better side between that and the mac and cheese. Our other dish was the burnt ends with mac and cheese. The hype on the Burnt ends is real! It was the star of our meal! It was flavorful and tender. The two dishes were more than enough for us so don't order with your eyes.

I guess you can park across the street, but that's not convenient and I think it costs to park over there (it's the Bistro Le Bon parking lot).  The night didn't start off too good.  We waited, and waited and waited.  One of my friends got thirsty and attempted to go in and get a drink....and that was also slow.  There were only two bartenders on duty and one was slinking drinks with a busted hand.  Like legit, he was taking off his slink to work the tap.  Anyways, we finally go table inside.  The hostess was very apologetic.  She said it took so long b/c we had wanted a table inside and out of the heat.  The night immediately turned around once we were seated.  Our waitress was fab, as was the hostess.  Drinks were plentiful and cold.  The food.  It was really good.   Honestly I got carried away w /conversation and didn't ask my dinning companions how theirs was, but no one complained.  I had the salmon sammie.  It was perfectly cooked and the corn coleslaw on top was perfection.  The hushpuppies were just OK.  I don't like them served w/ BBQ sauce.  The greens and mac and cheese were yummy, but nothing special.  The lemon chess pie was also very good.  There's a lot more on the menu I wanna try.  I'm giving solidly 4 stars.  Yeah that was a well-cooked piece of fish.  LOL",

The \"beef\" I have with the place is the price. $7.50 for a sandwich and $10 for 2 tacos is steep which for those prices should have included a couple hush puppies - a staple of all southern BBQ joints.",

They kept bringing him bowls of water and treats, and he loved the attention. The human food was just as delicious as his treats! We got two barbecue plates- one with burnt ends, and one with ribs. We got macaroni and cheese, baked beans, and collard greens for sides. Each of the meals came with hush puppies as well. Literally, everything was just divine. Both the collards and the beans were loaded up with bits of meat, which seems so rare when restaurants usually want to skimp on the good stuff! The hushpuppies were just the slightest bit sweet and were perfect. Our waitress also brought us a variety of BBQ sauces and vinegars to try, and all of them were wonderful. Our waitress was particularly kind when my boyfriend couldn't make up his mind about what kind of beer to get- she brought him samples of a bunch of different types, and gave him recommendations and descriptions of each. We just had the best time ever here. It's a shame we won't be driving through Charlotte again any time soon, because this restaurant was just top notch.",

Dismayed as to why people recommend this place.",

I would rate Midwood Smokehouse as the 2nd best BBQ joint in town, behind Bill Spoon's BBQ, but I'm sure some Charlotteans would disagree. Besides the pork BBQ, I really like the collards and vinegar-based slaw, which is getting harder to find nowadays. If you're looking for a fun place to have a beer and some great BBQ, Midwood BBQ should be at the top of your list.",

    "text": "Service is extremely kind here.  This was my first time trying NC bbq; I do live in KC, but don't have a marked preference for a certain kind of American BBQ.  I ordered the small plate of burnt ends + a side of pulled pork (I know, I know... a side of meat, but it's only 3 oz., and I really wanted to try it since pulled pork is one of my faves.  Good thing I ordered it because the burnt ends were not where it was at; burnt ends came out cold and chewy -- not fork tender and delicious.  Apparently the burnt ends were a weekly special (or something like that), and they were so popular they became a permanent staple on the menu.  They came with a fat tire bbq sauce that I didn't really care for.  The pulled pork, on the other hand was much, much better, and I also enjoyed the sharp vinegar-y flavors of the sauce.  I also tried the bacon-wrapped jalapenos (nice heat, and the bacon adds so much incredible flavor) which were the best things I ate at this spot.  The hush puppies were alright; they did come out hot, but not being from the south -- maybe I don't get hush puppies / don't know how they're supposed to taste; these particular ones were dense and chewy.  Not my favorite.   It feels kind of dirty in here... not the kind of dirty you'd notice immediately, but there are a lot of flies here and the place feels a little grimy... but this is a bar, after all.    All that being said, I want to circle back to how great the service was.  My server asked how the food was tasting, and when it comes to how tasty the food is, I don't mess around :), and I (gently) let her know that the burnt ends weren't up to par.  She offered to replace it with another type of meat, but I wasn't too eager to try anything else, so she actually just comped part of my meal, and I ended up paying for my iced tea and a couple of bucks for my pulled pork side.  After all of that, I'm just ambivalent about this place... if you do go, don't get the burnt ends, though.",

This girl knows how to promote a business. I tried everything, twice! Yes, it was that good. I heard that I needed to get over to their actual location to try a few other items.

What I love about Midtown Smokehouse was not only the food, It is incredible, but the service in the midst of packed place was PERFECT. I love it when I the appetizers vs. the entrees are timed perfectly. Meaning, when apps are requested they don't come out at the same time as the entree's. I know that may sound trite, but it really does show attention to detail. My complements to the Chef, Staff and Management.   For those who are visiting, you may wait for a table, but it's well worth it.   Mac's Speedway and Queen City BBQ, I love you very much. Ya'll are awesome. But you have some competition. :-)  Mean that with respect.",

I was looking for food that represented the South - BBQ or Southern. I was choosing between a Southern restaurant and Midwood BBQ and I chose Midwood. And I am so glad I made that decision - you step inside and the delicious aroma of BBQ makes your mouth water. We were immediately seated and served and we started off the meal with some hushpuppies, and oh my- I don't know what hushpuppies are but they are delectable!!! For my entree I ordered the Chicken BBQ sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. Let's just say my plate was licked clean - the meat was extremely tender and the BBQ sauce was perfect and the mac and cheese was creamy and not too heavy. We finished off the perfect meal with a perfect dessert - the pecan cobbler! It wasn't quite a religious experience, but it made me like pecans even though I usually don't! Let's just say we licked that plate clean too!   Overall the service was fast and the servers were very friendly and the food was unbelievable! I would recommend everybody and anybody to go here.",

I love brisket so it was disappointing to find that I had a blue cheese sandwich.  Overall I think they wanted to upscale the menu and lost sight of what makes a great brisket sandwich. Next time I'll try the sliced brisket to see how it tastes.",

Both the setting and service were good, in fact, they complement each other well.  This is not an in-your-face place, which would be antithetical to what bbq is all about.  It takes time to smoke the meat, it should take time to savor and enjoy.  The hickory smokes wings were very good; no sauce and they didn't need them at all. The brisket was very good and the collard greens-likewise.  I appreciated that one of the staff had a pepper infused vinegar and promptly put that in front of me--definitely good flavor there without overpowering the greens.  I like pickled onions....a lot and seeing them on the menu and then on the plate was a pleasant contrast to the rich brisket.  Midwood offers well balanced plate between the meat, greens, onions and hush puppies.  I don't trust a bbq place that finds the need to smother everything in sauce, the True flavor is in the meat.  Yes, I know styles differ, but for me it is about the unadulterated flavor of the smoked meat.  Midwood does a very nice job.  I would come back and try more on the menu.  If the other offerings are as good as the first, I could see going to five stars; however, with only one visit under my belt four stars are the maximum.",

I ordered the brisket plate which came with your choice of lean, fat, or both types of brisket.  Me being the meat lover, I went for both types.  The dish also included typical southern sides, and hush puppies.  The atmosphere was wonderful and the kitchen was pumping the smell into the dining room making you hungrier.  When the food came, I could not wait to sink my teeth into it.  The fat on the brisket melted in your mouth.  I used the back end of the knife and fell apart so beautifully.  Very attentive staff and wonderful food and prices definitely puts this place on the top of our list.  Only one caveat (they had no control over) was that parking was EXTREMLY limited.  They share a 30 car parking lot with 2 other businesses.  They also had street parking which was hard to find.",

I'm from up north so the whole vinegar style sauce is new to me. This place made me a real fan of it!  On top of the food, the vibe and decor is fantastic.

Kids had chicken tenders.  Impressed with the serving size of the kids portion.  Love best of all the hickory smoked sausage, baked beans which have been the best I ever had and the chopped Carolina pork.  We definitely will be visiting again soon.",

Called the manager who have me a chemistry lesson on wings instead of saying \"I'm sorry about that. Let's just get you some more wings.\" I literally live around the corner from this restaurant and would spend a pretty good amount there. Will never go back again.",

These people know what they are doing. Also highly recommended: the dry wings with sauce on the side. WOW. Some of the best wings I've ever had, served sizzling on a cast iron plate, amazing flavor and you can enjoy the meat separate from the sauce.   Also worth checking out: the bacon wrapped jalapenos (not at all spicy, my fiance through they were green peppers), the mac, and the collard greens",

I got the brisket plate, and boy was it delicious! My only regret is ordering a mix of lean and fatty, instead of just fatty brisket... the fatty stuff was far superior to the lean stuff! I loved that in every bite, I was getting all this delicious fat mixed in with the meat! The hushpuppies were pretty good, I'm always a fan of pickled onions, and the no frills coleslaw was really good!  If I'm ever back, I'll definitely try the other bbq, but at 10$ for my brisket plate, I'd always be OK ordering that",

Food I love:  *Brisket - combo of lean and fatty. Not too smokey, seasoned perfectly, tender and delicious. *Bacon wrapped jalapenos - these are the business and a must for me every time I eat here. The saltiness and smokiness from the bacon is a perfect combination with these jalapenos. Not fried and cooked to perfection. *Collards - seasoned very nice, tender and made in house.  *Smoked Wings - I read another review where it says they are pink in the middle but these are smoked wings and will be pinkish due to the cooking process. Do not let this deter you from their deliciousness. *Salmon - just as good as the brisket, ask for at least medium.  *Mac and cheese - won't make you slap your momma but don't sleep on it. It is quite cheesy and tasty.  I won't go anywhere else for brisket. Midwood has converted me.",

My ONLY issue is that they refused to seat them until we arrived.  These people were my guests and I wanted them to have a drink before we got there.  I didn't like that policy at all.    We ordered the Hogapeno Dip, a Queso Dip with Meat, a Queso Dip without meat, Fries with pimento cheese and the Bacon wrapped jalapenos to start with.  WE LOVED EVERYTHING.  My personal favorites were the Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos and the Hogapeno Dip.  OMG!!!  So good.  We ate every appetizer and everyone raved about how much they liked it.  I had the Carolina Pulled Pork with Creamed Corn and Cole Slaw.  PERFECTION.  Then I ordered a pig out platter for everyone to try all the meats.  The ribs were a huge hit and the brisket was amazing.  But those who ordered the burnt ends were in heaven with their choice.  They LOVED IT.  Since we had pigged out on the starters, we all ended up taking our items to go.  The Pecan Cobbler was so decadent and everyone loved it.  I had the strawberries and cream pie and it was delightful.  Our server was awesome and so polite (that southern charm is always appreciated).  He even took a group photo for me as well as one of himself.  LOL  A great night was had by all and I can't wait to come back EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm in Charlotte!",

    "text": "BBQ was ok, sides good, service fantastic!    Started with the queso app with pork.  Queso was good but pork was unnecessary.  The pork made the dish tougher to eat.  Then had the full Carolina pork with collard greens and mac and cheese. The portion of pork was substantial. It wasn't dried out but there was minimal amount of bark/smoke in it. The east Carolina vinegar sauce was really mild, not nearly as strong as others. Collard greens were best dish of the meal.  Mac and cheese was typical baked southern style.  Service was fantastic. Sat at the bar and was promptly served. Food came out as fast as possible.  Refilled drink regularly.  Overall not bad.",

The service was great in the restaurant and we were did not hesitate to agree that we wanted Midwood to cater for us. And 2 weeks later....we were at Freedom park and Midwood provided great food and service for our event.  The greatest thing that also prompted this 5 star rating is....the service we received from the person that delivered the food...and helped with setup and service.  Simply amazing.  Will get back to Midwood for another great lunch or dinner!!",

Being from CA, we have many excellent food options, but we don't have BBQ like this.    The waiter was super helpful in guiding me through the options and recommending what to order.  I ended up ordering the burnt ends, brisket (lean), and sweet potato fries.  OMG.  The burnt ends were cooked to perfection, with a sweet BBQ glaze and simply melted in the mouth.  The brisket was out of this world, and when eaten with a few thinly sliced pieces of the white onion that is served with it, to die for.   I am very happy that I walked a mile and a half to the restaurant.  I ate so much that it hurt, and the walk helped justify to myself that it was the right thing to do.  I can't wait to return to Charlotte and eat here again.",

    "text": "4.5 stars rounded up for good service and a great atmosphere and THE AMAZING PECAN COBBLER.  I've heard much about Carolina BBQ and it's goodness, so I decided to pick what seemed like one of the best BBQ joints in Charlotte.  I'm not a BBQ snob by any means, but I've had my fair share of the stuff and am a Southern Belle originally, if you may - I know good BBQ when I taste it.  Service here was great - our waiter was helpful, extremely patient with us waiting for our 3rd person, and very friendly.  Great show of True Southern hospitality.  We opted out of ordering appetizers, since the one we were going to order (bacon wrapped jalapenos) was a choice for a side dish.  The 3 of us \"pigged out\" with the pig out combo platter and doubled (actually, paid extra and tripled) on the ribs and got double brisket.  The ribs were delicious and I loved it with the habanero BBQ - love the heat, which isn't too much.  The brisket, however, was lacking for me.  It wasn't the best brisket I've had and it wasn't as juicy as I've had other places.  They have choices of lean, fatty, or both.  As for the sides, the mac and cheese was heavenly.  Not way too cheesy and just the right amount.  The bacon-wrapped jalapenos reminded me of jalapeno poppers, but not frozen, and seems like they are made fresh.  A little too much bacon for me though (I know right, too much bacon said nobody ever).  The cole slaw (regular flavor) was refreshing.  Bottom line - get the mac and cheese!  Now the dessert was THE STAR OF THE SHOW.  The pecan cobbler, which is basically like a MASSIVE piece of pecan pie without the crust nobody likes to eat, is probably one of the pecan-pie-anythings I've ever had.  You MUST get the vanilla ice cream on top for an over-the-top overly-sweet indulgent dessert and you must NOT think about the calories.  My friend and I shared it and didn't think we would finish it, but after the first bite there was no stopping us.  I love love love loved the filling of the pie - perfect consistency.  I will definitely come back just for this.  Great choice for BBQ in an area close to Uptown.",

    "text": "Nothing that blew our minds away, but good BBQ all the way around.  My wife and I dropped in on a Tuesday at about 9pm and the restaurant still had quite a few customers, but there were also plenty of empty tables. We were immediately seated by the hostess and waited on.  As tourists of the area, Midwood was actually our backup choice for BBQ in the city as we were hoping to try Lexington Barbecue, which was about 40 minutes north, since we had read about its authenticity to the region, but it was closed. On top of it, we had read that Midwood was Texas-style BBQ and not Carolina-style, so we were really hoping for Lexington to be open. With all that said, we saw all of the rave reviews for Midwood (4.5 stars from 1100+ Yelp reviews) and the fact that Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton had dropped in, so we thought it had to be somewhat good, even if it wasn't representative of North Carolina.  After a review of the menu, we went with a combo platter of Carolina chopped pork, beef brisket, chopped chicken BBQ and hickory smoked sausage, and a classic BBQ plate of burnt ends. For our sides, we had the hushpuppies, classic mac & cheese, coleslaw and BBQ baked beans.   Like I said earlier, everything was good, but nothing was interstellar ridiculously great. The real standouts to us were definitely the brisket, burnt ends and sides. The brisket was very tender and juicy. The burnt ends were fatty on one end and meaty on the other, just the way we like them. We loved all of the sides, not much to complain about there. The sausage was also good, but nothing to write home about. As for the chopped (pulled) pork and the chopped chicken, they were a bit dry, but that was to be expected considering what type of meat they were, so make sure to douse them in lots of the house BBQ sauce.   In closing, we liked the down to the Earth atmosphere inside and the modern BBQ restaurant setting. Our waitress wasn't extremely friendly, but she wasn't rude either. They just did their job as expected. Also, other waiters who were wrapping up for the evening passed by during our meal and made small talk so that was appreciated. We just wish we were a bit more enthusiastic about the food after our visit.",

    "text": "Came here with a friend for dinner on a Wednesday evening. When we arrived the place was jammed packed. After having it in my bookmarks for sometime, the crowd reassured me that this was the right choice. We approached the desk and had to wait a beat (for the staff to finish chatting) before we were added to the list.   After waiting about 15 minutes for a seat, we were seated outdoors on a gorgeous summer evening just as the sun began to set. Perfect.   With very little effort, I knew what I wanted: the brisket with mac and cheese and creamed corn. My friend ordered the salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries. Our waitress was prompt and accessible without being overbearing. Perfect service. After about 20 minutes+ of conversation, our food arrived.   Enthralled, I dug in. I was quickly disappointed by the flavorless meal that set before me. The brisket was perfectly cooked which is not easy to do, but flavorless. Almost no seasoning, whatsoever. I am a purist when it comes to meat. I believe that the sauce is a complement to the existing flavors not a substitute for them. The fact that I had to douse the meat in sauce just to get down half of it was not a good sign. The mac and cheese was horrible. Just mounds of cheese on noodles. No creaminess. No binding. Just cheese sprinkled on over cooked noodles and heated. Literally mac and cheese.  No milk, no egg, nothing, no seasoning. The creamed corn had the taste and texture of canned corn and was over cooked and also under seasoned. The hush puppies were also lackluster and dry.   I was truly disappointed. I'm not sure if they had a rough night but this place didn't live up to the bar that was set for it. I would say that I would be willing give them another try but I am not sure that I would. Some things are flukes but these flaws seemed like carelessness on a busy night. If you can't do it right, 86 it. Don't slap things on a plate and call it a meal. I had no energy or desire to complain because I felt like it was irredeemable.   Sorry, Midwood. No can do.",

    "text": "Okay, as far as BBQ goes... Midwood is one of the best that Charlotte has to offer. I've been here about 3 more times after 2012 and I have to say the improvement has been drastic. No wonder that Obama came here when he visited Charlotte.  This place was thought by my parents to try out, and well because of their dietary restriction/dietary preferences BBQ is always a sure winner. Something that serves fatty keto diet like options will always win them over. What won them over when it came to Midwood was the question: What type of cut would you like? Lean, Fatty, or medium?\" Yep. That was it.   The past three times that I have been here, we've ordered the platter and just shared. We also got the jalapeno poppers which was always a treat, however be warned that the spiciness of the peppers can go either way. It could be a little spicy, or it could have a little more kick to it. I guess it just depends on whatever your tolerance is.  For the combo option, we ordered 2 briskets, ribs, and sausages with sides of jalapeno peppers and greens as those were always nice to have. And for a pig out feeding us all for $34, it's not a bad price and definitely should be looked at if you have multiple people with you or just two people eating. Service was pretty good, nothing to really say about that, we came during the afternoon so it wasn't horribly busy.  Check this place out, the BBQ is good, I would say stick to the briskets, ribs, and wings (if you're looking for chicken). I can't vouch for the pulled pork or the chopped chicken as I haven't had it in a while.",

    "text": "If I don't count the food truck I visited one day for lunch, then this is probably the best BBQ I had in a week of being in South Carolina (plus this one evening in Charlotte). I am sustained by eastern North Carolina BBQ (it's at the bottom of my personal Maslow's hierarchy, just below wifi)  so I had to try even though I know this isn't that part of the country.  We started with pimento cheese fries, because, well, pimento cheese fries. These were broiled before being served, and they were totally delicious. Zero complaints here - nice browned cheese (and plenty of it) and nice crisp fries. Good stuff.  Then we split the burnt ends and the chopped pork. Burnt ends were almost like...ham cubes, I've never had burnt ends in this kind of a regular shape. But they were in a good sauce, even if my normal preference isn't sweet BBQ sauce, and they were tender and tasty. So I'm not going to complain about those. And the chopped pork was decent - reasonable amount of smoke if not a bit dry, but I fixed the dry problem with their vinegar sauce, which I liked. For sides, we went with collards and cole slaw, both of which were fine. Greens were trending a bit sweet, but that's OK, without a ton of garlic. Slaw was fairly basic, nothing really to write home about.  So, tons of good reviews here, I feel like I am bucking the trend. It's not bad, it's just not exceptional. Our service was good, the price was totally reasonable, and the food was fine...I just have to believe there are better options. Alas, it was a Sunday night and several of the more hole in the wall places with photos of food that made my mouth water were closed.",

    "text": "Just moved to Charlotte and have been enjoying dining my way around the city. Midwood Smokehouse was on my list from the get go, and my husband and I finally made it there on a recent Friday for dinner. I am noticing a trend in my reviews that when you can smell the restaurant from down the street, it's usually a great sign. We parked in the gravel lot off the side street, and could smell the smoker as we walked toward the restaurant. We arrived a little after 5:30 and were surprised that we pretty much had our pick of tables. The Yuengling draft special made this PA girl happy - we've spen the lastt 4 years in Texas without access to Yuengling - so we're thrilled that so many restaurants in Charlotte stock it. We split the Well-Fed Combo Platter - with Carolina pulled pork, St. Louis style ribs, brisket, and chopped chicken barbecue.  The \"smaller\" Well-Fed combo platter was plenty of food for the two of us, I appreciated that our waitress did not try to convince us to go with the larger Pig-Out platter.The platter came with pickled onions, hush puppies, and choice of two sides - we picked barbecue baked beans and mac & cheese. The food came out pretty quickly and looked great! The ribs and pork were our favorite; after spending so much time in Texas, we should probably know better than to order brisket anywhere else - it was decent, but reminded me more of a pot roast than the brisket we've come to know and love. The mac & cheese was delicious - most barbecue joints in Texas don't offer it as a side, so I've been getting mac & cheese everywhere it's offered. We finished the meal with the peach cobbler ala mode, which was fantastic as well, love that it's only 75 cents to add ice cream. The only downside of the whole meal was that there was a piece of glass in my beer - but luckily I found it before it made it into my mouth! By the time we finished, almost all of the tables inside and many outside had filled, so we just arrived a little early that night. We'll be back!",

    "text": "Called at 6:15 on a Friday night to order 2 lbs. of pulled pork and 1 lb. of lean brisket, and were told they were out of lean brisket, and to hold on to see if they had enough mixed brisket.  They came back to the phone and said they would not have any more pork for a few hours, and that they could not fill our order for brisket either.  We were not offered an alternative, and wound up driving across town to the always reliable Bill Spoon's BBQ.  How could a bbq place run out of two of their most popular items by 6:15 on a Friday night?!  Coincidentally, I just heard the other day that the cardinal rule of bbq is \"Don't run out\".....",

    "text": "I have been to Midwood 4 times so far and the previous three experiences have been excellent.  Unfortunately, I went  last night with a table of four and the service was not up to par.    We elected to sit outside instead of wait on a table inside.  We ended up waiting anyway because no one greeted us for 15 minutes.  As a server I understand sometimes when its busy you may be unaware that you have been sat so I went inside to inform the hostess we had yet to be greeted.  Our server (Jessica, I believe) then showed up and took drink orders.  I asked if there were any specials and she said no.  (I found out as I left that there were $5 vodka drinks on special.)  After she tried to push appetizers we ordered our meals.  A food runner brought them out to us and my order was wrong.  He walked away while another runner brought out the second two orders which were correct.  My order was brought back out and the runner claimed the correct side item would follow.  Another side was brought but it too was wrong and he left so quickly I was unable to tell him so.  The entire time our server did not check on us once.  My boyfriend had to leave the table, track her down and ask again for the correct side along with some extra sauce (she did not ask what sauce he wanted with his pulled pork to begin with.)   When she finally returned with the correct items (without a single apology) I was nearly done with my main dish.  Don't get me wrong; I don't expect a barbecue place to be fine dining.  However I do expect prompt, courteous service in any restaurant and unfortunately, this time around I did not get either.  I will return though;  that pulled pork is too good to pass up!  Hopefully next time the service will match their food.",

    "text": "Frank Scibelli extends his master restaurant skills to the realm of BBQ, with his newest creation, Midwood Smokehouse.  When the weather is good, the (two) patios expand the limited amount of tables to be decently acomodating; otherwise, expect a fairly significant wait.  Once seated, prepare to stuff your face, because the food is good and the portions are plentiful.  Surprisingly, there are a fair amount of veggie options on the menu - vegetarians aren't restricted to just a veggie plate of sides, but can also order a grilled cheese or black bean burger.  Unfortunately, the macaroni & cheese scores only about a B... bummer.  But the carnivore in all of us will be pleased by the pork, chicken, brisket, ribs, or smoked turkey, and three BBQ sauces (vinegar, Texas tomato-based, and SC mustard) satisfy even the most picky eater.  Don't fill up too much though, because the pecan cobbler is not to be missed... and yes, add the ice cream.  You're welcome.",

    "text": "I would give this place 4.5 stars, but for some reason I am only allowed to pick between 4 and 5.  The reason for the slight deduction is slight and rather meaningless.  While I like Midwood, this place is kind of on a busy street, so the scenery around it is just okay.  So if you are considering this place, you should know that my only issue is more of a non-issue.  Especially since the grounds and environment of the actual restaurant is fantastic.  There is both inside and outside seating.  As long as it's not too hot and dont mind a little sun on the face, outside is great.  Inside, literally, the first step you take in the place you are hit with the wonderful smells of delicious BBQ.  The food is wonderful, regardless of what kind of BBQ you like.  Fresh, juicy, lean, and just full of taste!  They have a great beer and drink selection (who doesnt like a 24oz PBR or a nice Jack Daniels-fueled drink??).  The decor is really great, I mean the men's room walls are full of sex symbols from the last 3 to 4 decades...and rumor has it the ladies room has the same style.  To me that is just a cool touch.  Great food, great atmosphere, and the staff are tremendously kind and attentative.  Go here, you will be happy you did.",

    "text": "As I've said in other reviews, I almost never give 5 stars, not trying to sound like a snob, but this place deserves it. Great, real wood fired BBQ as well as the typical smokehouse fare. It's right off Central Avenue, the location is a bit odd in an older area of town, with some newer apartments across the tracks and some older cottages behind it. Be on the lookout if you're driving, it's tucked back so it can be easy to miss. Accessible by bus and hopefully streetcar soon, maybe 10 mins from uptown, so a good option if you're visiting without a car. Staff is polite, food is great, decent prices. The ONLY complaint I have, and that really has nothing to do with the establishment itself is that parking is very limited. I'm not one who feels entitled to a parking space everywhere I go, but you may have to circle the block a bit, the city doesn't tow this area though, so unless someone calls you should be alright.",

Spicy jalapenos and smokey bacon, a win win! I ordered the Cuban which was delicious, juicy and perfectly pressed. The flavors of the pulled pork, ham, and the melted Swiss are a perfect combo. My friend ordered a chopped salad with the chicken and said the chicken was cooked perfectly with a great smoky flavor. And lastly, my other friend ordered the burger. Not much to say about a burger piled high with pulled pork and bacon with side of cole slaw. Delicious. Great selection of local beers on tap as well.  As I said, we arrived late and the kitchen closes at midnight. We were the only people left in the restaurant at around 11:45 pm and the staff didn't make us feel rushed to leave or approach us to move on.  Great food and great service.",

Being that I'm not a fan of sweet meat, my hubby has always said that Carolina Bbq is more vinegar based and savory, so I had to give it a try. AMAZING!  We started with a couple of beers and the bacon wrapped jalapenos. Then we got the biggest platter we could share. Complete with pulled pork, burnt ends, jalapeno cheddar sausage, brisket, Mac n cheese, greens, and hush puppies. We destroyed it!  Colby, our server was friendly and courteous and was very quick to offer his advice on what to order when we arrived. Thank you for the help because our meal was very enjoyable.",

It's awesome they have opened more...BECAUSE it's sooooo good. Yes that good!   I've liked everything I've tried there. But these are my go to favs that you must try:  Carolina pulled pork - their Midwood sauce is the. Best.  Baked Mac & cheese - yes please! Sweet potato fries! - I only share if I really love you.  AND. jalapeno bacon wrapped poppers. Yes.   I've also tried their creamed corn, prob the best around here for that, if you like corn. Like how is everything there this good?   They have a good selection of whisky. Com'on it's a bbq place! Also full bar. And lots of local brews. They got it all.",

They have a great beer selection, and really every other kind of drink you could hope for. I had a delicious IPA, and hubby had sweet tea.   I ordered the brisket meal (small) - and got both fatty and lean. Now, I have had delicious fatty brisket before. Sadly, it wasn't here. The fatty was far too fatty and hadn't seemed to render down any. The lean however was really tasty. I got the mac & cheese side (yum) and loved the hush puppies.  My husband got a \"large\" plate of the burnt tips. They looked great, and tasted good (but not great). Here's why... more than half of them were dry, hard and chewy. There were a few tender pieces that saved the dish, so we'll say it was decent. The sauces were great, but the smoking just wasn't on par with our expectations today.  Overall, we give it a solid 3.5 stars - rounded up for great service and location. Definitely give the mac & cheese, beer list, and banana pudding a try! Enjoy!",

Decided to come here after reading all the amazing reviews and ordered the smoked salmon dish and the bbq platter with brisket, tips, ribs and pulled pork. My friends ordered the beef ribs. All I can say was that everything was out of control good. The salmon was served on a bed of buttered corn and tomato and had great flavor. The bbq platter was amazing , with my favorite protein being the pulled pork. The collard greens and beans were my favorite sides. Now.. the beef ribs... you do not understand how good that was. This 10 hour smoked piece of beef  literally fell off the bone. Best thing I've eaten in a long time. If you aren't  intimidated by meat get this ! Have some texas toast with it as well. Also... protip: order the banana pudding as a side. It is this creamy beautiful dessert with vanilla cookies. Worth all the calories ! Also come right when they open to experience  no wait.  We showed up at 11 am on sunday and got seated immediately.",

She also took forever to bring us drinks and refills. A wait is understandable but when I see you joking around at other tables and taking your sweet time, I get impatient.  The poor service here was unfortunate because this place is worthy of 5 stars. The drink selection was pretty good and included some local beers. I went with Wooden Robot's overachiever which was a nice fruity pale ale. For food we got the brisket queso dip which was yummy and I got the pulled pork with bacon wrapped jalepenos and hush puppiesbfor my entree. The pork was fresh and flavorful, just the way I like it. The sides were a nice compliment to the pork as well. My friends did complain that the ribs were dry and to me they did look pretty dry, which is a no go.  Again the food here was good but our server really hurt the experience.",

We aren't fans of Eastern bbq and prefer a more Texas dry rub style and this looked like a good place when they offer dry ribs and choice of fatty or lean brisket, that's usually a good indication. My fiance said this is the BEST brisket he has ever had, and he has eaten it all over! I got the cheesesteak with shaved brisket and it's probably the best cheesesteak I've ever had as well. It takes a lot to impress us but our meals here definitely did. Lots of bbq places get the meat right but the sides aren't great and bland, this place does both very well. We had sides of Mac and cheese and baked beans which were excellent and flavorful. I feel like our brisket taste is now a little ruined because we will have to come back to Charlotte on our travels for our favorite again!",

Of course, we had to get the smoked wings as well, which were delicious. For dessert, we had the peach pie. It was good but not what I expected of a peach pie. It was more of a deconstructed cobbler. Was good, will keep returning!",

I wasn't in love with the pimento cheese- I know it's a local delicacy but I guess I don't have the palate for it. I also got the pulled pork sandwich with hush puppies! All excellent ! So filling!",

    "text": "Overall Midwood gets 5 stars! Good BBQ and a great place. We left a lot fatter than when we walked in.   We were staying in Charlotte downtown and found this place on our way in. Our visit was on the 21st of July of 2017.   Food - I'd give 4 stars! The food was really great, but I've had better BBQ.   What we ordered: We ended up getting the combo with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. Our sides were cream corn and beans.   The ribs were dang good, cooked perfectly with a nice amount of smoke. Lacked the flavor that I've had in other places...but real close to being amazing. Same with the brisket.   The pork, however, was outstanding. Some of the best flavor I've ever had on pulled pork, and it was perfectly juicy.   The cream corn was also outstanding! The beans were a bit of a runnier mix, also good. The beans worked really was a dipping sauce!  We also got some hush puppies, which were about average for hush puppies.   NO CORN BREAD!!! WHAT THE FRANK??? Why no cornbread? What does the chef have against cornbread? Why did they deprive me of this tasty side dish?  The ambience - I'd give 5 stars!  The place feels inviting and comfortable. Big tables for all the food you're going to order, comfy seating, good bar, TVs, nice outdoor seating, and clean bathrooms.   An added touch was the plates and dishes! They aren't boring and plain...feels like something you'd find at grandma's house.   The staff - I'd give 5 stars! The host was really friendly and paid close attention to us. Even let us move when a booth opened up.   The waiter was very helpful and patient with all of our questions. He genuinely wanted us to have a great experience.   We had no problems with our food arriving quickly and everything was perfect.   Conclusion This place has a great reputation for a reason and we couldn't have been more pleased. Unless the had corn bread!!",

I also love Thursdays when smoked turkey is on the menu. And don't over look their smoked bacon wrapped Jalapenos, salmon and wings. Those might be the very best things on the menu. I haven't had a bad thing to eat there and I love the atmosphere. If you've never tried Midwood, I encourage you to do so. And don't forget dessert!",

They have a nice wine, beer and cocktail menu and so much yummy food.  Hubs and I went here on a date night. Expect a wait, because it's a popular place. But you can join the wait list on yelp prior to going ;) We waited about 25 minutes for a first available table, which wasn't too bad. We got a table inside, which is spacious and nice. Patio seating is more intimate. Hubs got their new featured drink called the French Canadian, a whiskey-based cocktail, and he really enjoyed it.   For food, we decided to split the 4 proteins, 2 sides meal and ordered ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket with sweet tater fires and mac n cheese. This shared option was the smaller of the two, but it was plenty of food for us! We both left so stuffed. The meals also come with delicious hush puppies and a spicy BBQ sauce and a vinegar sauce. Everything was really, really good and we will definitely be back.",

I has to sample my tables choices as will and the Mac and Cheese is worthy of every 8 year old, the baked beans had a great twist with some tomatoes and a tiny bit of pork and the sweetness was perfect. The curly fries were Fab too.  Add to that a great selection if on tap beer, friendly staff? Quick service and I will be back. Nice job Smokehouse.",

I'm not a BBQ expert but I truly feel this place accomplished the goal and it impressed my out of town guests so that is the most important thing!  Like others have stated, the atmosphere is \"down home,\"  the service is friendly, the prices are reasonable, etc.  Between the 7 of us we literally sampled the whole menu...pork bbq, chicken bbq, burnt ends, smoked turkey, ribs, etc.  We also tried the pimento cheese fries for an appetizer and they were nothing short of amazing!!!  The baked beans are a must for your side choice.  They are full of flavor and even have some bbq mixed in.  They are awesome.  Again, I'm not a huge BBQ person so is this the best place Charlotte has to offer?  No clue.  Does it showcase some pretty authentic Caroline BBQ?  I think so!  Good variety, good prices, good side orders, nice sized portions--yes, I'm a fan!",

The Mac & Cheese is second to none, and the fries crisp and delicious. The family-friendly atmosphere is wonderful, with spacious tables and booths, and service is always prompt and efficient.   There's a small patio for outdoor dining, ample parking in a private lot (or curbside), and a spacious bar for those dining alone. There's also a Ballantyne location for those prefer to stay in the friendly confines of South Charlotte, but for my money, nothing beats the original.",

    "text": "It was my guy's and I first time traveling through Charlotte, N.C. and Yelp helped us choose the barbecue joint we were going to patronize on our first night in town. I am really glad we chose Midwood Smokehouse.   We walked in and were seated immediately at one of the high-top tables. Our server greeted us right away and recommended a couple of North Carolina brews to try and both of us enjoyed the beer we received, which scores points for the place right off the bat.   After asking the server a few questions (which she politely and knowledgeably answered) we decided on the beef brisket and the smoked half-chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed the brisket which I felt had so much flavor that it did not need any additional sauce. The chicken was slightly dry but when paired with the sauces, both my partner and I thought was absolutely delicious. We did ask our server to bring a side of every sauce so we may try them. (I loved the spicy habanero.)  For side items I ordered for myself the bite-sized bacon-wrapped jalapenos which were rich and spicy all at once. We also shared the mac 'n' cheese and the BBQ baked beans. My bf fell in love with the mac 'n' cheese while I swooned over the beans which contained pieces of pulled-pork, adding a lot of flavor to that particular side dish.   All-in-all, Midwood's was the best BBQ place we had traveling through both North Carolina and Tennessee. I would definitely revisit if I'm ever back in the area. I'm still thinking about it a week later.   I recommend walking upstairs and enjoying a sweet view of the city after dinner.",

I also feel the need to mention the Cuban.  I imagine that many people overlook something like a Cuban sandwich while at a barbecue joint.  I too, tend to be one of those people...until now.  I am truly thankful, that I can so easily step outside of my box. But...now I feel like I'm going to be stuck for a while.  The Cuban sandwich is SO good.  I mean...really, really good!  P.S.  Did I mention how good the Cuban is?  Try:  Really??  Avoid:  Not trying some sweet potato fries for your side...very nice",

    "text": "My family checked out this place this past weekend and for the most part enjoyed our meal.  Our waiter was friendly, and quickly took our orders.  Just a few notes:  The BBQ Queso was so-so - there was nothing special about a bowl of tortilla chips and a bowl of melted cheese with a clump of BBQ in the middle of it.  I guess I wasn't sure what the expect, but it still seemed very basic.  As for the main meals, my son got a burger and wanted American cheese, but the waiter said they did not have any.  As in, ever.  And yet the menu clearly stated American cheese was used.  Despite this, my son just got a plain hamburger and ate the whole thing, so he had no complaints.  My daughter got Carolina BBQ with a side of baked beans.  She liked the BBQ but not the beans - she didn't really say why.  My husband got burnt ends and loved them, but said the mac & cheese was pretty pedestrian.  I got a sauced half-rack of Memphis ribs with sweet potato fries.  The fries were good, but the ribs were VERY salty.  It was almost as if they brined the ribs before they put them on the fire. They were that salty.  I ended up drinking 3-4 huge cups of water (their cups are about 26-28 fl oz) to compensate.  Would we go here again?  Probably not.  The prices were reasonable, and the space was decent (GREAT music playing over the speakers), but the food wasn't very \"wow\" for us.",

Seemed to be made in house or at least fresh from local supplier.   Sides: Mac n cheese was good but not stand out. The bbq baked beans were good with the right amount of sweetness and kick.

Our waitress (whose name I wish I remembered) was extremely prompt & courteous with a great sense of humour. Our drinks never got below half empty because she was always just close enough nearby to provide excellent service, without hovering. I highly recommend the \"burnt ends\" which are not burnt at all, but perfectly cooked to be nice and crispy on the outside whole being tender & juicy on the inside. This will definitely become part of my regular rotation of great barbecue joints in Charlotte. The hush puppies were also fantastic; very well done with just the right amount of crunchy while bursting with flavour. They offer many different regional styles of barbecue, so you're almost guaranteed to find something you'll love. Excellent portion sizes, also. I tried my darnedest, but could not clean my plate.",

Me and my entourage of 7 were greeted promptly by a friendly server who was in the beginning stages of laryngitis, poor guy.    A few members of my party were from out of town and we wanted to try a bit of everything.  We got the pulled pork and smoked turkey plates with a sample of all of their sauces.  The pulled pork was good, and their sauces were decent.  My party preferred the Fat Tire BBQ Sauce which was a bit too peppery and thick IMO but it did in a pinch.  Smoked turkey was a bit lacking and was a little dry.    The service was great and accommodating.  We were there on a mission and they accommodated all of our special requests without a roll of the eyes.  I passed by the \"smokehouse\" on my way in from the parking lot, but didn't taste the smoke int he food which was disappointing.  Their mayo slaw was overly chopped but had good flavor.  BBQ Slaw is never my thing but there's was ok.  Midwood has decent cue, don't get me wrong and if I Was on that side of town again and in the mood for BBQ I'd go again.",

The food was still okay - I love their sauces, but the jalapeno poppers were over cooked and mushy, the meat portions seem to have gotten smaller, and the service has become spotty.   My last visit was the worst service I've had here. Our food came out, and our server dropped our check off before I'd even taken a bite of my sandwich. He seemed to want us to leave, and I immediately felt in a rush to do so. He refilled my cup but neglected to refill my partners. And we definitely weren't hanging around to try to get anything else from Paul and inconvenience him. So instead of ordering desert (our check was already on the table remember), and getting another drink... we ate our food in less than 20 minutes and left. We went somewhere else for desert and received better service.   I hope that Midwood returns to how it used to be, for now they've lost a fan.",

I'd give it six stars, but Yelp won't let me, so we'll just have to settle for a \"Fuck yeah this place is awesome!\"  In two words, burnt ends.   In many more words, the prices are very reasonable, the service is always fast and polite, there are awesome drink specials, and the vibe is casual, friendly and more than a little bit southern hipster.  As for the food, there is nothing here not to like. The only thing I'm a bit \"meh\" on is the smoked vegetables, but they're still pretty tasty. The chicken is so good, you can eat it \"dry\" (it's plenty moist) or with your choice of outstanding barbecue sauces. The brisket is incredibly delectable - as a friend of mine says, \"Best brisket outside of Texas\" - the fatty brisket especially deserves a freakin' medal. The sausage is a well-thought-out mix of savory and sweet, with a nice pop in the skin when you bite into it. But, the creme de la creme is the burnt ends. So sweet, so chewy, and with a caramelized flavor that is not of this earth.  Every meal comes with your choice of side(s). The bacon-wrapped jalapenos are sinfully masterful. The mac and cheese is delightfully cheesy. The collards are down-home. Everybody also gets some hush puppies and pickled onions - both are amazeballs (literally, in the case of the puppies).  Great local beer selection and some very tasty looking desserts, although I'm always too full to try them.",

They have a good menu selection of pulled pork, chicken and beef brisket, and a healthy choice of sides to choose from.  The problem I had was what to try, but my salvation was the taco plate.  Yeah, that seems like a strange offering in a BBQ place, but you could mix and match 2 or 3 tacos to try all meats (pork, chicken and brisket), and it comes with a choice of side too.  HINT:  The creamed corn, and bacon wrapped jalapenos are delicious.  The coleslaw comes on some of the tacos, so you got to try that too, and it was good.  We got fried pickles as an appetizer and a couple of local Carolina craft brews on draft made for an enjoyable meal.  Too full to try the cobbler for dessert, maybe next time.",

I regular here a few times a month and it's easily one of the most consistently delicious restaurants I've ever been to. The BBQ burnt tips are one of the best BBQ dishes I think I've ever had (including the infamous Rendezvous in Memphis!) and their sandwiches are always tender and hot.   Once and a while they'll have a Garlic Wing special. If you go and they have them you hit the lottery; they're incredible. The wait staff is always on point, fast but not quick to rush you out. It's always incredibly clean and the drink specials are usually pretty decent. I don't have a single negative thing to say about this place and I've eaten here literally dozens of times.",

    "text": "The brisket is the best we ever had.  Just the brisket itself would be 5 stars.  Parking: the parking lot is very small.  When we leave the parking lot, you have to drive to the back of the parking lot and exit onto the side street.  The side street has cars park on both sides and is only wide enough for one car to pass through.  When we were leaving, we nearly got hit by a car that was making a left turn onto the street.  Just be careful.  Service: great service. The hostess greeted us warmly.  Our waiter was very friendly and keep our drinks filled up.  Food: Other than the brisket, I only liked the sweet potato fries.  These were the other things we ordered: - Pimento cheese fries: Crinkle fries tasted like the frozen kind.  It was very cheesy.  My kids absolutely loved it.   - Smoked wings: too much smoke flavor for me - BBQ Pork Sandwich: It was pretty good.   - Combo platter (pig out): Three of us shared this platter and we still had left over.  We picked 2 portions of combined (fat + lean) brisket, sausage and ribs.  And the side items were mac n' cheese and sweet potato fries.  Everyone loved the brisket.  The sweet potato fries were one of the best ones I had.  I didn't like the hush puppies or the mac n' cheese at all.      Two days later, we stopped by and bought a pound of briskets (from the bulk order) to go.  The bulk order would need 24 hour advance notice.  We were lucky that they had enough for us to buy it that day.  By the time we got to our hotel, the brisket was cold.  It was still very good.  If we are in the area again, we will definitely stop by to get some brisket.",

I ordered the brisket platter and my colleague got the burnt ends. We ordered mac n cheese, collard greens, and hushpuppies. We went all out and ordered the chicken wings with midwood sauce. It was heavenly. These wings were cooked and smoked then covered with yummy sauce. I'm not sure why wings are always made this way. The main courses were perfect. So tender and the sauce was perfectly executed. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is really nice. Our waitress knew the menu front and back and was a real help.  I really need to go back to Charlotte just to eat at Midwood.",

SMALL mind you and I couldn't finish it. It came with 4 meats. I got the pulled pork (really dang good, pour just a little of their vinegar based sauce on it to put it over the top) Brisket (they ask you how fatty you want it it was .... oh my god ... it was awesome) Sausage (it's sausage how could it be bad?) Ribs (OMG ribs they come with a dry rub DON'T YOU DARE POUR SAUCE ON THOSE RIBS ok you can put sauce of the ribs but try them without sauce the rub is really good) Sides I got the mac and cheese (if you're sensitive to salt you might think it's too salty I thought it was good) and the beans (they  were good with an interesting pork and peppery flavor). I've drug my poor mom to three BBQ places in as many days so she got a salad and was VERY happy with it (lots of different kinds of lettuce no iceberg, roasted corn etc etc). I tasted the shredded chicken on top and it was tasty and not at all dry.  We had some hushpuppies before the meal they were very good served with their signature tomato based sauce (which is GOOD I took a pint home with me). They have a great beer selections and they even have a few vegetarian options (something called a black bean burger?? and mom says they had three different salads. I dunnow I'm a carnivore) We asked because my sister is a vegetarian  and the waitress was right on top of what they had that was vegetarian so if you have a friend who prefers killing plants to animals and you can drag them in the door they won't starve. Service was fast and very friendly they totally kept on top of keeping me in drink. I'm going to try REAL hard to make it back before I leave town. So much more to try there. And guys.. (by that I mean men) use their bathroom.... just trust me on this.   If you're a local and you haven't been here  WHY ON EARTH HAVEN'T YOU BEEN HERE?   If you'e not a local and you're just passing through seriously give them a try.",

My daughter had an appt nearby, and asked if I could meet her for dinner there, along with her sister. It was a lot bigger inside than I first thought. The hostess was very friendly and smiled when she greeted me. That instantly made me feel welcome. It smelled so good, and the atmosphere was more like a diner. They do serve beer here and our waitress was very friendly and did a great job keeping our drinks filled and getting fresh beers when we were ready. Their pricing was very reasonable, and my chicken bacon sandwich and sweet potato fries were perfect! Generous helping too, and I couldn't even finish it all! My only recommendation is that I think they could do a little more to update the decor a little, however I will definitely visit again and next time bring my hubby!",

I had the combo plater with brisket, smoked turkey, sausage and pulled pork with coleslaw and bacon wrapped poppers. Yes, I will be checking into the nearest hospital for the impending heart attack.  The sauces are served on the side in small dipping cups. I prefer squirt bottles to having to ask for more BBQ sauce (I like lots of BBQ). The turkey was great as well as the pork and sausage. Here is the 'but', the brisket was served with the grizzle still attached. Ok maybe that's just how they serve it here. The problem with this is the fat out weighed the beef. It broke away nicely but I barely was able to enjoy the tender meat before it was gone. Concluding, I had a good meal with only one gripe. Enjoy yourself here.",

    "text": "A ton of food for a super reasonable price! I had the BBQ pork with bacon wrapped jalapenos and sweet potato fries. It also came with coleslaw and hush puppies. The large plate filled my belly and left me enough meat to take home for another meal. I liked that they offered a couple different BBQ sauces in squeezable bottles so you could have as little or, (in my case) as much sauce as you wanted.  While I didn't have a drink that night, the beer/cocktail/liquor list looked extensive.  They work with the 'No Wait' app and it's busy every night of the week, so I'd take advantage of it!",

    "text": "I tried this place last night, at the request of some friends visiting for the holidays. For one of them, it was their first NC BBQ experience and that makes me sad because this place leaves a lot to be desired.   First, they were out of three of the menu items we tried to order, one of which was ribs. How does that happen!? It was pretty busy, and this place seems to have a following, so maaaayyyyybe that's why. Still, it's a bummer to have your heart set on ribs when going to a smokehouse, only to find out they have none.  Second, since they were out of ribs, they offered to sub an item in their \"well-fed\" menu option FOR AN UP CHARGE. If you run out of an advertised item, and offer to substitute, don't follow that offer with a price tag.   Third, the food we ordered was bad. Plain and simple. The pulled pork and chicken were dry; the baked beans were more shredded meat than beans; the smoked veggies were flavorless and cold; and the coleslaw... well, that was actually pretty good. Our food also came with a side of hush puppies and \"pickled\" onions, both of which aren't even worth mentioning, really.   Fourth, the service was mixed. The hostess was super friendly, and we were seated fairly quick, despite a crowd. Or waiter wasn't exactly rude, but he also wasn't very good at his job. A few questions about their drink menu were answered with a very blunt \"I have no idea\" with absolutely zero effort to find an answer that was actually helpful. He checked in frequently enough, and was friendly-ish, so I guess that counts for something.   I walked out of this place feeling so confused. How can it be rated so high!? Did I catch them on an off night? Is it resting on its laurels vs it's actual abilities? Has no one who has eaten here ever eaten BBQ anywhere else, and therefore has no idea that this place is mediocre, at best? I really hate to give such a bad review to a Charlotte eatery, especially when I'm clearly in the minority by doing so. But I can't, in good-Yelping-faith, say otherwise.",

    "text": "Oh my god. A carnivore's heaven and True southern BBQ jackpot not to be missed. It's places like this that make me certain I can never become a vegetarian. And I have no regrets.   Highlights:  Smoked wings (dry with sauces on the side) - they're sized like nuggets but are so tender and packed with flavors. Possibly one of the best tasting wings I've ever had - would come back just for these apps.   Pig Out platter - the bigger version of the combo platter that gives you 6oz each of 4 different proteins plus 2 sides. We had the mixed brisket (MUST GET), sausages (good but paled in comparison), ribs (delicious), and substituted our 4th protein with the burnt tips (YUM). Our favorites were definitely the briskets, which were incredibly flavored and so juicy and tender. I recommend getting the fatty ones (more marbling and tender). The baked beans were surprisingly tasty as well. Would've loved some sort of carbs to soak up all the sauces.   It doesn't look much, but the pig out platter is pure meat and enough to share among 3-4. Needless to say, we had more than half of it boxed to go.   Service was prompt and representative of southern hospitality. All in all a shack-less but amazing BBQ joint without pretense - a must stop.  Tip: Work out before coming if you're looking to make gains. It wasn't until near the end of the meal did I realize I had not consumed a single piece of greens throughout the meal. And I'm perfectly fine with that.",

Midwood Smokehouse was almost unanimously recommended to me by everyone I asked. It took me awhile to visit, however, because my friend had a poor experience-- he had food poisoning following a visit to Midwood.    I finally decided to try it out when my parents came to visit last month, and we all loved it. Everything was great, and that is saying a lot because we are particular about our barbecue!   Great drinks, great food, fun atmosphere!   Needless to say, I was really looking forward to my second visit when my SO came into town. The second time around, Midwood was very packed. We waited an hour, and the meal ended up being very disappointing. The meat was dry and the service was lackluster. To top it off, the next day we were both sick!  So disappointing!

    "text": "DISCLAIMER: I'm from Texas, where BBQ is a religion. This heavily influences my review.    The BBQ here is actually quite good.  I ordered burnt ends, which I haven't found yet at any BBQ joint. They were quite good, but came six to an order, with a side and a few hush puppies for $12.50.  I'd estimate, you are getting 6 oz. of brisket for that price, which is insane.  I could buy 6 oz. of filet minion for less.   BBQ naturally uses cheaper cuts of meat..which is why they long cooking process. It should be cheap and quick and plentiful.  This was none of that.  I waited for nearly a half hour, which was made a bearable thanks to a large selection of draft beer.   Since many of the N. Carolina BBQ restaurants I've been to offer signature Mac-n-cheese, I ordered that as my side.  Just like every other N. Carolina BBQ restaurant whose Mac-n-cheese I've eaten, this is nothing special.   Hush puppies here are actually better than anywhere else I've had them in N. Carolina.  In Texas, you only get hush puppies with sea food, but here they are served with everything.  Generally, they are bland and frozen...but I think these are fresh.  I don't know why more places don't make their hush puppies fresh, since corn bread batter is probably the cheapest and easiest thing to fry.  Another big plus for offering one of my favorite things in the entire world, bacon-wrapped jalapeno.  Where I come from, these are a staple of any cookout, but rare to find in a restaurant.    I will go back to Midwood Smokehouse, but I doubt I become a regular.",

There is a great selection of local brews that we enjoyed. He tried the smoked chicken wings with the fat tire sauce and ranch (such good sauces!) and it was sooo good. Meat was so tender, juicy and flavorful. We were about to get the queso with the pulled pork because it sounded also delicious, but the waiter recommended this because it was more of a speciality.   I got the pulled pork sandwich so I could try some genuine Carolina BBQ, and the waiter suggested the creamed corn saying it was the best he's ever had. Well of course I had to try it! It was definitely delicious. I will say it is more on the liquidy side as opposed to being creamy per say, but I don't want to say \"watery\" because that implies a lack of flavor, which it definitely not the case.   My husband got the cheeseburger that had the pulled pork on it, and it was also very delicious. Some SERIOUSLY GOOD EATS!!   Plus they have corn hole to play outside, neat decor, and awesome murals in the back of the restaurant building!",

I was waiting for my take out order to be completed and I happened to look over and witness one of their server's take a shot of whiskey or tequila which ok none of my business but apparently that wasn't enough for her alcoholic ass  so she proceeds to open up a straw and stick it in her table's drink and pull it out to taste, now luckily she did not go back in for seconds, but nonetheless, she was blatantly stealing from the restaurant which btw ends up costing you and I because that loss has to be made up. But this was at their bar counter on the backside in plain site so my deepest concern is what is she doing in the back as she goes back there to grab our food. I'm going to go out on a limb and say she's taste tested some of our food along with our drinks. The most troublesome thing is not knowing whether she has hepatitis or herpes, or anything we as customers can contract from her nasty habits. It is of the upmost importance that we all done in a safe and clean establishment and are not put at risk because Erik the manager felt a warning would be sufficient with dealing with, theft since she didn't pay for the drink and if she did why is she drinking on the job? I'm sure ABC would like to know how they are working within the limits of the law when it comes to drinking on the job.",

We got half price local beers--the Bad Penny is a Tasty Deal--and split the \"Choose 4\" platter between the two of us with a few bites to spare. With three beers and lunch for two, it was $30 (not incl. tip). A fair deal!  I'm not always a sausage fan, but their version is packed with flavor and nice and moist. I also can't stand mustard, but I swear this version with the sausage tasted like tangy cream sauce. The beef brisket was one of the more tender, flavorful versions I've had, and paired with their brown sugary house sauce, all I can compare it to is Christmas.  Mac n' cheese was just dandy, and the fries were hot and crispy.   Hush puppies were well done, but would have been phenomenal with a side of honey.  All in all, a good barbecue place we will visit again.",

Of the dozen or so places I've tried in and around Charlotte, Midwood is probably the best but the ribs are still just ok, no char, no amazing dry rub and sauces that are moderate when it comes to flavor.  The vibe of the restaurant is laid back, has a nice neighborhood feel, the menu has all the bqq joint classics and a few surprises as well.  The staff are courteous and efficient which probably helps since Midwood obviously deals with a great deal of volume.  If I have guests who want bbq I'll likely take them here but I still dream of finding an old dude in a shack with ribs that make me weep.",

    "text": "Food: I think this is the best BBQ place in Charlotte. Definitely get the banana pudding.   Service: docked two stars. We ate here on Halloween - some of my friends are from out of town so I was excited to have them experience some Carolina BBQ. We were seated quickly and ordered drinks and food at the same time. Food came quickly. However our waitress made sporadic appearances with prolonged absences. She brought our food and left without asking if we needed anything else...and we did...she didn't bring any silverware. Our friend had to get up and go to the bar to ask for silverware. when she did appear we asked for a side of sauce. Fast forward 15 minutes...we already finished eating and she brought our sauce.  An unfortunate experience. I generally love this place and will come back for the food but don't expect the service that a five star worthy restaurant should have.",

Although we were told the wait would be 20 minutes, it only ended up being 10! Our waitress was attentive and was helpful in menu decisions. I settled with the Carolina Pork BBQ small plate. It was delicious! The portion was a lot larger than I would have expected. I will definitely come here again.",

Also be a fat kid and order a side of the baked beans and dump those bad boys on there. Do it. For real. I would start listing things that are good here but I would start at the planter near the door. I love it all. Eat here as soon as possible if you haven't already. Burnt ends are a must for first timers.",
