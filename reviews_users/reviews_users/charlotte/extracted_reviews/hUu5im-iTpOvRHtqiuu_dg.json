Your taste buds won't jump up and dance especially after they slip your runny pork on your plate with a tiny ice cream scoop but at least it doesn't make you sick and that's really the goal for airport food anyway right?",

The sauce definitely helped the taste.  The green beans were okay and the Mac and cheese was mediocre.  I'm not a big brisket fan but the brisket looked absolutely delicious!  In hindsight I should have ordered that instead!! My total was $13 which isn't too bad for airport BBQ.  If I'm ever in this airport again I will come back for the brisket or pulled pork.",

The first young lady laid out the bun and then put the pulled pork on the bun.  She then slide the plate to the next young lady.  This is where the fun began.  She asked what did I want for my side.  I said I would like my cole slaw on top and I'd like a side of fried okra.  Man I love fried okra.  Anyway, the girl says that I only get 1 side.  I said I understand that, and that the sign says that I am to get cole slaw on top and then 1 side.  So I repeated that I would like my cole slaw on top and a side of okra.  She then proceeds to take a big ole scoop of cole slaw and then flop it down all over my plate.  She got some of it on the meat but most on the side.  She then slide it up onto the glass counter top.  I looked at her and said I don't think so and walked away.  Man, talk about having a bad day at work.",

Great BBQ it is not, but it's serviceable, and quite a bit better than your options to the left and right.  I went with the three meat platter.  The brisket was 1/2 fat; I'm pretty sure I got the end chunk.  The pulled pork was decent, and the turkey had a good smoke but was pretty dry.  They have one sauce option...yes or no.  Definitely not mustard-based, but recommended as it's not overbearing.    For healthy sides...well, you're at a BBQ joint, so good luck with that.",

Despite the mystical allure of the ramen burrito at reagan international, being a passionate liberal means I try very hard to avoid being reminded of that guys presidency. BBQ makes me feel better though.   My many stopovers here have turned me into a seasoned BBQ gourmand, highly attuned to the subtle sweetness of the sauce, the crunchiness of the fried pickles, the tenderness of the brisket. Sometimes I think back to the days before I ever came here, when I had never even heard of a hush puppy...who was that bright-eyed young lad? when does life really begin??  Or maybe I was just vertiginous and overly excited to find a non-chain restaurant after 5 hours on a stuffy fart-filled plane with 10 crying babies, who knows.   Also, its in a really central location within the airport so its easy to walk to from concourses A, B, and C. And if you really want to induce food coma before your next flight there is Cinnabon next door.",

After a long day of cookies and pretzels, we both had the brisket. For sides I chose greens and coleslaw, plus cornbread. All were done perfectly - no burnt ends here.  We got covers for our plates and hurried to catch our flight, waited until altitude was right and tore into our delectable dinners to savor the remains. Servings were generous. It would have been great to take part of the dinners home.  The meal was more than I could eat.  This is a do not miss if you fly through this airport. If pressed for time, you can get it to go.",

In order to get two meats you have to get three. Double up on one to be able to get brisket and pull pork.  I still ordered it.   Brisket was dried and tasteless. It's like they use a separate smoker for brisket as it tastes bland.   Disappointed big time.   Service is rude and not helpful.

Take if from a greater Kansas City BBQ enthusiast (I eat BBQ 3+ times a week...yeah...I'll croak from a heart attack before 50, but whatever).  Half of these (mediocre) reviews are from people that got chicken, because they're east or west coasters who are either abhorrent  or oblivious to brisket and/or pulled pork.  Take it from a professional, if you happen to be on a layover here (which I was, for 3.5 hours...twice); this is the place to stop in at and get an actual BBQ meal that's surprisingly good.  The brisket was smoked all the way through, incredibly tender, and quite moist...with a slathering of pretty good tangy style BBQ sauce.  The second visit got a heaping helping of pulled pork, also slathered in the tangy Q.  The red potatoes could have used some more butter or something, but overall, they were still pretty good as well.  The cornbread...was cornbread...which is good, but not eye popping.  The first go round included some very tasty green beans.  The second go round had collar greens (a superb choice).  And the fried pickle was better than average.  About the only thing that wasn't great was the beer selection.  But it's an airport, so I digress.  This place is definitely worth the stop if you're a beef/pork BBQ fan.  And for those that complain about the price; burger king next to it wants $9 for a whopper and fries, why not drop an extra $3 and get a real meal?  Seriously folks...",

Here is what I thought: Pulled pork - really dry, and almost crunchy at times... definitely pass on this if I had to do it again Brisket  - pretty good actually, salty but good and flavorful  RIBS - Never again! They were pretty much all bone, and so dry that I nearly broke a tooth! Given that this was a $4 add on to the plate I feel somewhat angry about it Hush puppies - ok, nothing earth shattering  Greens - really bland, although it didn't taste salty, kind of a shame, because a pound of salt may have actually improved the taste.",

Ambiance is airport hurry up, and price was airport painful, but the alternatives were less appealing. There are other bbq establishments in the airport so this one did not totally win me over, so if I return I will give them a try. This joint doesn't make the list.",

The brisket was incredibly tough and chewy, no flavor as well, disgusting.   The BBQ sauce and sides were very good but a place that specializes in BBQ needs to improve on their namesake. Really disappointing, threw the meat in the trash after a few bites.  Judging by reviews I'm sure they have good days but certainly they lack any signs of quality control.",

It's always been from the grocery store. The BBQ was delicious. Light vinegar-based and requested a side of the bbq sauce in a ramekin on the side. The bbq baked beans were pretty good. The corn was really dried out, like it had been sitting under the light for far too long. You get 2 sides and a choice of cornbread or hushpuppies with the platter. I also grabbed a Smart Water and a cupcake container of banana pudding, which I've continued to enjoy today.  Why am I giving it 3 stories? The corn was dried. The lady behind the counter who asked my order didn't even wait for me to speak before slopping a bunch of bbq sauce all over the bbq. While the sauce was good, I didn't want it covering my bbq. So, she shouted with irritation and ordered someone else come forward before she started my plate over. I was exhausted from traveling all day and low on energy so I just needed to catch my breath before completing my order. The food was good, fast, and easy to eat though.",

For a platter you got two sides and a piece of cornbread, because we weren't too hungry we opted for the sandwich and one side. Food was delicious and they piled the pulled pork high. Portions were good for the price. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the food was lukewarm. But other than that the food tasted good.",

The sandwich was just as I expected ... lots of pulled pork with sauce - and the taste of vinegar was not covered up.  The mac and cheese was very good, freshly made and very hot.

    "text": "All I had was Greens, Green Beans, and baked beans, which came with a fried pickle spear.  I wanted to try out the barbecue, but just wasn't feeling it at 11:00 AM.  The greens were marginal.  They were cooked right, but there was just no flavor in the greens themselves.  Even with pepper vinegar, they were sort of bland.    The green beans were terrible.  Way overcooked for french style green beans yet way undercooked for southern style green beans. The beans themselves weren't the best either.  To top it off, there was no seasoning whatsoever in the beans.  No salt, no pepper, no pork, nothing.  I get keeping pork products out, and even animal products altogether, but you have to give some sort of flavor to green beans, or cook them lightly.  You can't half-assedly boil them and plop them on a plate.  The baked beans were good, but not really anything special.    The cornbread and pickle were very good.  Their cornbread is the sort of cake-style fluffy cornbread and was the best thing I had while there.   The fried pickle had a pretty perfect batter on it and would have been great with some sort of sauce.",

The service was impatient and not personal at all.  The food has potential of being better.  There was good favor.  We had the sampler, however w/ that and the 2 beers the price I thought was too high.  Save your money for barbecue and go someplace else.",

Fried Pickle was OK but it had been out of the fryer for quite a while.   I didn't try the brisket but I saw it.  It had a nice smoke ring but looked more like pot roast than brisket.  On the other hand, how are you going to serve good, fresh BBQ at an airport?  The sliced turkey breast looked good.  All in all, above average for airport food.",

On a recent trip to and from Texas, my flights happened to stop in Charlotte, and me having a love for barbecue I decided to try this place.  I liked it so much that as soon as I got off my plane on the return trip, I headed straight for this place in the food court.  I had the beef brisket sandwich, and it was really good with the sauce smothered on top.  I also tried the fried okra and baked beans both of which were good.  The only thing I think that I didn't really like about the place was some of the staff.  When I went there, the staff mainly comprised of workers that didn't speak english very well and were very soft spoken.  Just a small road block though en route to some good food.",

I was a little skeptical of airport BBQ but after reading a few of the reviews, I decided WHY NOT?!  I went with a brisket platter which came with two sides. I opted for baked beans and fried okra. It also came with a fried pickle and cornbread. Trying to cut calories here, ya know. (Yeah right.)    The brisket was surprisingly tender, to the point where I could cut through it with my plastic fork. I really like the BBQ sauce on top, as well. The fried okra was a little soggy, baked beans pretty standard, and the cornbread good. May not sound like the most rave review, but I almost devoured the entire plate and was overall quite satisfied with my Carolina BBQ experience thanks to that meat.  It wasn't the cheapest. For the platter and an unsweet tea, I paid around $16; however, if it's BBQ you crave, I would suggest giving this spot a try.",

The 2 meat plate also came with a couple of sides.  It did not take long for them to get my food ready, and I wondered out to get my eating utensels and a table.  No forks were available, so I took a spoon and a knife.  Then I grabbed some napkins and headed out to the very crowded dining area.  After sitting down, I headed straight for the pulled pork.  I was delighted as it was very good.  In fact, it was so good, that I didn't take a bite of brisket until completely devouring the pork.    I should have stopped after eating the pork.  4 slices of brisket were sitting ready to be eaten, and I went after them.  With the first bite, I knew I wasn't in Texas.  The brisket tasted like roast cooked in an oven.  It was very disappointing, but I should have known better than to get beef in pork country.  I ended up throwing the brisket away.  Would I go back?  I would go back for the pork but would skip the beef.",

This is along the foodcourt wall isle that connects gates.  I had a brisket plate with corn and macaroni and cheese.  The overall taste and preparation was at better than you normally get an airport food court establishment.    You watch them prepare it so if you see something wrong you can speak up if desired.  I noticed canned beans -- really?  I guess some like that.",

And when I land here, I've discovered that this BBQ joint (good,but not spectacular) gives me the just needed Carolina BBQ fix.   Not being a True meat and potatoes girl, I find that getting a kids' junior meal is just right for me. I guess that works out to a normal NYC plate anyway. A scoop of pulled pork with the requisite extra dash of hot vinegar, smoky collard greens, a cornbread square and fried pickle spear is the perfect layover snack.  Best part of the deal? It is under $5. Probably the best value and cheapest airline meal you will find in the entire country (discounting Mickey d).",

My mother and I walked around to canvas which restaurants were open and what time. We wanted to have something that would be specialized in North Carolina so we stayed away from ethnic and big named fast food chains.   We found out that the \"food court\" section opened at 5:15. We took a look at their menu and saw that everything was reasonably priced and the food sounded good.   Unfortunately we really wanted to try the steak and eggs because brisket sounded super appetizing, but it was not ready to be served.   We ordered one sunshine plate with bacon, a Biscuit and Hash browns for my aunt. My mother and I both ordered the country fried steak with hash browns, biscuits (asked for gravy top), and a side of scrambled eggs. I ordered the sweet tea as my drink and they ordered water.   The portions they gave were very generous. 2 pieces of country fried steak each and 2 hash browns per plate. The sausage gravy was fairly good, but the chicken fried steak itself could have been a little better,but still good. The eggs were okay, they needed more seasoning, and I'm also partial to my eggs cooked over easy. I wish they had an egg choice selection. My favorite part was the biscuit. It was fluffy, baked perfect ,and tasted delicious, especially with the gravy on top. The sweet tea was also very good because it wasn't too sweet or bland, it was the perfect mixture.   The service was excellent the people were so friendly and also funny!  I'm not sure if I'm every coming back to North Carolina, but I'd have this place again. I do want to try their BBQ menu.",

We were in the richmond, VA airport and had a pretty sub par dinner so when we landed in the Charlotte airport and the lure of BBQ was omnipresent, I decided: when in North Carolina, eat bbq. Initially the BF protested bc we already ate dinner, but I remained persistent and it paid off.   We split a pulled pork platter and it was delicious. It was tender, flavorful, and not dried out at all. Definitely splash it with the spicy vinegar at the cash register. They have I think about 9 sides and each platter comes with bbq meat, 2 sides, and a choice of hush puppies or cornbread. You're bound to hit something you like - unless you're vegan, vegetarian, or don't eat pork or beef, in which case, you should probably never stop at a BBQ joint in the South. Also, airport food can be a lot worse (I know bc crappy airport food just happened to me a couple of hours ago). At the end my BF said \"good idea, babe. Glad we stopped here.\"   Got a layover in terminal b or c? Stop here, it's pretty good. Best BBQ in the world? No but good enough to get you where you're going feeling satisfied.",

I like that they throw in hush puppies and a fried pickle spear. After sitting down with my lunch, I remembered that I came here previously and ordered the 3 side platter, where I pick 3 sides as a meal because the meat is a little questionable. The staff was unprofessional... but again, this is pretty consistent with airport quality service..",

Charlotte has a nice, open, impressive food court which included this BBQ/Southern eatery.  Not every food outlet is open at 5am, but Brookwood is at 5:30 or earlier, depending on the attitude of the crew.  A life-saver for the hungry as once  you get into the A Concourse there are only bad, stale, greasy, cheesy English muffins and cold, too much bread, dry sandwiches at a small nook food outlet.  Brookwood serves hot, flavorful food.  Breakfast is eggs and meats, they even have some BBQ available, again depending on the operating crew's mood.  The other food outlets don't get going until after 6am, so we are thankful for Brookwood.  The A Concourse, the one I frequent as a Delta flyer does have a Wendy's and a hot bun place, but those open later and their offerings are not too great for a traveler.  Give these guys your business as a way of saying thank-you for being convenient to early morning travelers.",

It's a collection of bad fast food and off-brand, trying-to-act-bougey-and-gourmet joints managed by HMSHost or some similarly uncaring, vanilla, corporate overlords. However every once in a while you find something decent, even at an airport otherwise dominated by chains. Since I travel a lot, I have gotten pretty good at seeking out the diamonds in the rough, and this is one of them.   Now, would this stand up against the best BBQ in the downtown area of your average city? Probably not. But when it comes to airport food, this is millennia ahead of everything else. It's assembly line, which makes it quick. The brisket is pretty tasty. The baked beans are good. The greens? Passable. Is it expensive? Sure. But hey... so is EVERYTHING here. It's an airport.   This is an easy choice for anyone not wanting gross, industrial foods from notoriously gross fast food chains. It's actually decent. And it served me quite well. Do yourself a favor and skip the BK, Quiznos, and other garbage and go here instead.",

I've eaten here twice this year, and both times I had ribs and sides.  Ribs are tasty and not drowning in sauce. Sides are also good...I've tried the mac-n-cheese, collard greens and fries.

The sauce wasn't bad - it was sweet and added nice flavor to the ribs.  The ribs, on the other hand were tough.  Out of the five ribs I ate, only two were moist.  The ribs on the end were dried out, and most of the meat on all of the ribs was difficult to get off the bone.  The sides were the best part of the meal - not outstanding, but what I would expect for macaroni and cheese and broccoli salad from a takeout restaurant.  The cornbread was also dry.  My advice - enjoy the sauce on one of the other meats (pulled pork, brisket) that is available.",

Portion was beyond plentiful but I still scarfed most of it down since I skipped lunch, it was so dang tasty and I didn't want to waste.  Thank you for a great meal and I'll keep this place in mind for future CLT flights.",

This restaurant is located the the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte North Carolina.   By the way this is really a super nice airport. See my review on this airport. So we were on our way home from Las Vegas and anytime you are on your way home from Vegas, your pretty bummed out. So being sad that I have to go home and go back to work, I needed a nice meal to cheer me up and let me tell you I found a super nice meal the Brookwood Farms Carolina Pit BBQ joint. Yes my Yelp friends this restaurant cheered me up.   The Carolina's are famous for their BBQ and this place won't let you down. The food is already prepared so all you do is order and they fix your plate and your done. This is important when you have a connecting flight. We only had about 45 minutes between flight and we needed good fast and this place is set up for just that.   The employees are really nice and seem like they enjoy their jobs. I got a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries. It was Carolina BBQ at its best. The pork was moist and tasty, the Cole slaw amazing and the fries crisp and tasty. Just what you need when traveling. I feel like I want to drive the 6 hour drive from my house in Virginia to North Carolina just to have lunch or something here, it's worth the drive.   If you are ever flying through this airport, then stop and get yourself a great BBQ sandwich. You'll be happy you did, enjoy.",

I'm glad I did. It was top 3 bbq I've ever had. Got the 2 meat platter, pulled pork and brisket with green beans and collared greens side. The greens were not to salty and awesome. Same with the beans, cooked perfectly with just the right seasoning.  The brisket was moist and so tasty and I got some burnt ends in there. The pulled pork was meaty and very little fat, perfect tenderness. The vinegar-based sauce was so good! Not to rich like commercial sauces. I was very surprised at this place. Definitely will be back.",

I was honestly grateful that the food was quick and readily available as we didn't have much time to grab a bite and sometimes the airport lines are ridiculous.  I got the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich with a side of mac and my husband got a platter with hushpuppies, fries, and corn which came out to about $30. The food was pretty good. I was a fan of the mac as it was pretty cheesy and creamy.  Overall, it's a nice, hardy, and quick option in the airport. A little bit expensive but reasonable when you see what you are getting and comparing that to the other options in the airport.",

The sign mentioned something like best in Charlotte. So of course I went with the BBQ over maybe a slightly healthier option next door.   But seriously, the owners (and fans should come down to Austin) for a visit and objectively compare the brisket there. Even the lower tiered bbq joints have better meat. Note I purposely said meat. It's the quality of the meat at the end of the day that makes or beaks a quality brisket. For example, Pit Master Franklin of the famous bbq place in Austin uses the briskets only from one farm that raises the cattle to a high European standard.   Ok sure the fried pickle was good and unique. I do have to go back through CLT back to Austin:-)",

I've heard of Brookwood prior to coming to CLT for my short layover. Somehow I expected this typical food court style restaurant to taste and feel like a university dining hall. While they were able to definitely quell my BBQ cravings, I left feeling like I wanted more.  More sauce? More meat? Perhaps a bit of both.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich which comes with a decent amount of meat tucked in between two buns, which weren't toasted. You have a choice of two sides so I opted for the cole slaw and mac n' cheese. They also throw in a fried pickle which was an added bonus.  For $10, I would rate this airport BBQ better than expected, but still lacking some of that genuine BBQ punch I was hoping for. The bread used for my buns was very stale so I ignored that entirely. Pulled pork on the other hand was right up there, although I would have liked a bit more smokey flavor. Can't win em all at an airport right?  If you're looking for options, Brookwood should definitely be on your list of places to try here at CLT.",

Plates (meat, 2 sides) run around $13-15 which really isn't terrible for BBQ, especially in an airport.   I opted for smoked turkey which was pretty good but probably pumped with brine since it was moist but really salty. For sides, their mashed potatoes were great - really well seasoned, and they're definitely real & not instant. The Mac and cheese on the other hand is an abomination - flavorless mush which went uneaten after a bite.   Dinners come with cornbread or hush puppies. I opted for cornbread (because I don't know what hushpuppies are) and it was moist, fresh and still warm. Meats are served unsauced and there is only one rather sweet BBQ sauce option which I passed on.   The people working the line were nice, there are lots of side options, the portions are good and the prices are decent. If you're stuck in CLT and the Chick-fil-A line is 50 people long, this place is a good choice.",

    "text": "Grabbing a \"to go\" meal to eat on a plane is an increasingly smarter tactic than relying on an airline who may/may not be offering something decent on any particular flight.  But airport choices are often limited to pizza/burger chains or fancy sandwiches that really aren't that fancy.  So while changing planes and terminals in Charlotte, I happened to wheel by this place and thought I'd give some Carolina BBQ a try (when in Rome).     They've got a combo meal with choice of meat and 2 sides, so I went with pulled pork, beans and slaw, and they threw in a fried pickle and corn bread as well.  Up in the air, between NC and PHX, I opened the platter and the smell of BBQ'd meat, sides and cornbread almost started a mini-riot among fellow passengers.   The pork was well cooked, with both bark and pinkness, and could be eaten politely with a fork in the confines of an airline seat (ribs would be tricky/messy).  The sauce had the Carolina vinegar zing - with some heat - and the sides were solid.   It was like enjoying a really good backyard BBQ, but in the middle of an Airbus 320 at 35,000 feet.    Debating great BBQ is like debating Pizza... everyone has their favorite styles and many will never be happy outside of their faves.  All I can say is this particular meal tasted great to me, and what's even better is that it's found in an airport terminal food court.  Which brings up an interesting caveat to this Yelp review...  I'm not even sure one can eat here unless inside the secured area of the airport.  That is, if you happen to be walking around the streets of Charlotte looking for chow, you can't (or can't easily) pop into this location without a boarding pass.  Likewise, if you happen to be flying through Charlotte (a major connector hub), you likely wouldn't have time to actually roam the streets of Charlotte and have other choices of Carolina BBQ... so reviews of this place should be engaged in this context.             Bottom line from me:  if you happen to be passing through this airport, looking to grab something to eat in the terminal or take on the plane, this is both a good and unique choice.  It got an extra star from me because the home cooked style made me forget - if only for a spell - that I was crammed into a coach seat for the next 4 hours.",

    "text": "Our flight to Jacksonville Florida was routed through Charlotte, North Carolina. Weird, right? I would have been more irritated by this if it weren't for the fact that on the hour-plus layover, I would have the opportunity to try some reasonably authentic North Carolina barbecue.  I should let you know: I'm a BBQ... afficionado. In about another year, I'm going to start calling myself a professional. Still working on brisket though - it's quite challenging! At any rate, I've been on this BBQ thing for about three years now, perfecting my slow smoking techniques, sauces and rubs... so I come at this review with a not insignificant amount of experience.  Naturally, I'd heard much about NC BBQ, and while its anti-tomato pro-vinegar reputation didn't actually sound all that great to me, I was still anxious to sample the fare that has earned the devotion of so many.  I had the pulled pork \"classic\" sandwich, which states that it is prepared topped with cole slaw. I had to prompt my server to do this, however. As any good BBQ afficionado knows, this is God's own preparation for pulled pork, an idea original to North Carolina and perhaps one of the best things in BBQ. I guess the masses probably don't know this, as the server seemed almost confused when I asked for it and of course, in my own experience, when I tell people this they almost universally give me a suspicious stare of revulsion. Until they try it, that is - but I'm digressing.   Pulled pork is also remarkably difficult to screw up, so it's usually my baseline. I ordered the mac and cheese as my side dish as I will always do when it is available, unless it has the telltale fluorescence of the boxed variety. As a bonus, all meals are served with a battered, deep-fried pickle. Sweet!  As I suspected, the vinegary flavor of the pulled pork, which was very competently prepared, was off-putting to me. The taste of the smoked meat itself was nearly impeccable - perhaps a tad oversmoked - but the vinegar (I think unsurprisingly) leaps to the front of your palate and screams LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME YEAH THAT'S RIGHT DOG THAT'S HOW WE ROLL IN NORTH CAROLINA.   I didn't care for it.  The mac and cheese, while delicious, suffered from being overcooked and mushy in texture. The pickle, while a great idea, was not that good. It had been sitting around though, so maybe it's better fresh, but I think deep fried pickles are better as chips than as a spear.  In summary, I think perhaps the Charlotte airport is not representative of the best BBQ that North Carolina has to offer but I think it did reinforce in me the notion that I had going in. This vinegary flavor profile is either an acquired taste or perhaps just something that can only impress those who grew up with it. I won't give up on NC BBQ altogether, but color me relatively unimpressed so far.",

Very sweet and very sour, it's like eating a sour patch. The green beans were overcooked and very soggy. The one thing I was looking forward to was the cornbread which disappointed me.

    "text": "Hey folks,  Keep in mind that you're grabbing a meal in an airport! How many other airport food court stalls do you think get rated on Yelp?? There's a reason there are a good number of comments about this place - if you have to travel and get hungry between flights I can't think of any other place I'd rather grab a quick meal! My annual pilgrimage to Alabama from MD takes me through CLT. As soon as I get off the plane I head straight for Brookwood Farms. There's NO good BBQ in Baltimore, so this is my first chance to get a taste before I get to Montgomery (and have more).   For airport food it's pretty good. It's definitely better than any restaurant BBQ in Baltimore. But, it's not fine dining - it's airport fare. To be honest, I always get the same thing, so can only comment on the pulled pork. I get it 'Bama style, so have them add cole slaw to the sandwich. A side of fried pickle and I'm good for the next leg of my trip. I know I'm heading home once I've had one of their sandwiches. On my return trip I stop again since it's my last decent 'Q for awhile... Enjoy.",

Their brisket is dry rub, and they give you a side of vinegar based sauce. The option of signs are also well-made and tasty. For example, the collard greens are not sweet. They also have one of the best pecan pies I have ever had. The prices are also right, more so for an airport. It is a cafeteria style restaurant, where you stand in line, choose your items, pay, and go sit down to eat them.",

I should have told the guy nevermind when I saw him draining the grease from the pork (meat ended up being mushy).  At least the brisket was decent, still not anything to write home about.

This was like setting $30 on fire. Because taking a few bites we ended up throwing it all away and waiting in line at Chic-fil-a next door and getting something we could eat. And I HATE Chic-Fil-A for all they stand for, so if I'm lowing my own moral bar down to that level then you know this BBQ was just terrible.  The brisket was nasty. Fatty, gross, awful. The mac n cheese was probably the most edible thing but still just gross.  The pulled pork... if that was in fact pulled pork... was without a doubt the worst I have had.

I took a bite of the brisket, tried to bite it off and I couldn't. I ended up putting the whole strip in my mouth, chewed on it for over a minute and had to spit it out. It would not break down. The sandwiches looked good, but I'd 100% pass on the brisket.   Overall it was an OK meal. Not amazing but not bad. It's not worth $15, but at the same time it is airport prices.",

And then I tried the pie. I had no baseline expectations since I was a first timer, but I am pretty sure my life will never be the same. How I have lived 33 years on this earth and never had it before I will never know, but I looked up a store that sells it in my hometown (Walmart does lol) and now I'll be stopping there on my way home. I'm so glad I came here for lunch instead of the usual Burger King etc. This was more expensive, but way better!",

Round plates with flimsy tops in a regular plastic bag does not get food from restaurant to gate in one piece. They need some square cardboard boxes, flat bottom bags, and need to put in a wet wipe (because this is BBQ, for G%d's sake). They would end up with more satisfied customers that way.",

Ordered the chicken and ribs combo with mashed potatoes and cornbread..though i'm still curious about the brisket....  In any case, the ribs were a bit dry but they fell off the bone and the bbq sauce helped. the flavor-- I couldn't tell for sure, but It seemed like a liquid smoke flavor rather than genuine wood coal, bbq. The chicken was tender and moist which disappeared to mear bones in no time.  All in all, not the best bbq I've had, but it is definitely worth hitting up when you're stranded in layover hell.",

If, on the other hand, you find yourself in the CLT food court for some other reason -- like, say, you are waiting for a flight and got hungry -- then congratulations, you have discovered the promised land.  I have had a lot of food at a lot of airports, and this is hands down the best anywhere. Except maybe that wine bar at MSP.  Order the pulled pork; do not bother with anything else. They will ask if you want sauce. Even though you are in North Carolina, they actually mean some sickly sweet sticky slime because most of America has had its mind corrupted. (Did I mention Texas can bite me?) The correct answer to their question is: \"No, thank you; where is the vinegar based sauce?\" The answer to that is usually \"next to the cash register\" but sometimes it wanders off.  Sides? Baked beans and collard greens, of course.  You're welcome.",

BBQ sauce was a tad bit thinner than I was expecting, but a nice heat without being overbearing.

Because of the next flight, I wanted to keep it simple. I got pulled pork, with sweet bbq sauce, in creamy mac n' cheese.  It was a well-balanced meal. And by well-balanced I mean, I could get equal portions mac n cheese and pulled pork on each bite. The pork was juicy and melted in your mouth.   The cornbread was just ok. Unfortunately, It was nearly dry and wouldn't soak up the juices from the pulled pork and mac n' cheese without crumbling. Which was unfortunate because I LOVE cornbread  I don't eat pickles, but there was a fried pickle that came with the meal.   Next time I'm at this airport, I'm definitely coming back to Brookwood Farms to try the brisket!",

There's tons of options here (assuming they have it) I was interested in their bowl options too (maybe my next layover)  If you're in the airport and looking for a decent food option stop by... however it's not cheap and they don't offer to go containers... so I couldn't give them five stars because there's no real way to grab and go.",

    "text": "Brookwood literally had one of the longest lines in the Atrium for food besides their neighbor.  Walking through the Atrium trying to figure out what to ea, you got a hint of BBQ as you walk by, walk closer and the smell get stronger, so much so that you have to go and see what is creating such a mouth watering aroma in the air!!!  The servings are huge so if you are hungry, you wont be once you finish this meal!!!  Not starving but still hungry, I went with a loaded baked potato which I found out you can actually get pulled chicken or pulled pork added, which would make a hefty tater, I took a meatless option with cheese, bacon and chives.  The potato was huge to say the least and hit the spot!    The kiddo went with the Chopped BBQ Chicken platter which gave you a choice of two sides, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese and a fluffy large slice of cornbread!!!  Cheesy and creamy mac and cheese, the mash was whipped just right and the cornbread was not dry and you knew it had some butter in it!!    They have a lot of sides to choose from too such as collard greens,  green beans, baked beans, veggie rice and fried okra, which is a rarity when you find it on a menu.    If you are debating on getting the pulled chicken sandwich with the one side and a fried pickle, it is what it is, they will not let you make any alterations to that combo.  They also have sweet potato and I was heartbroken to see that they had sold out of pecan pie.    Everyone who helped us from the nice lady who made put together our selections to the young lady who rang us up where helpful and efficient.  The understand that your time my be limited and did their best to get you on your way as quick as possible.    Extra kudos to the cashier who told me the beer I picked up was $10 before she rand it up and let me know that I could get a bigger water than the one I grabbed for a few cents more.",

    "text": "BBQ in an airport, what could go wrong? Brookwood Farms can be sensed from many terminals away, in a sense almost leading you to it. You are in North Carolina, a layover to be specific, and one could experience some decent BBQ possibly?  I rarely come across decent airport food quite honestly, so I did not expect premium cuts of beef or pork with sides. I was really just hoping for a decent meal while waiting for my next flight. Long lines gave me some hope, but the cafeteria heated food left me questioning my decision, either way I went in for it. I grabbed the pulled pork multi platter option with some collard greens, cornbread, and fried okra. I do not think one can get more country than that. Puns aside the portions were quite plentiful and the pricing was what you would expect for an airport, very pricey. To the point, the pulled pork was pretty plain and the BBQ sauce was very sour, not my cup of tea. As for the sides, they were okay, and honestly did not have any complaints when it came to the okra, on point!  Would I re visit, probably not based on the lackluster meal I had here. There are plenty of other options in the airport that look much more appealing.",

And the prices and portions are very reasonable!  The 3 Meat BBQ platter is only $19 and includes 3 meats, 2 sides, and either hush puppies or cornbread.  Some highlights: 1. Smoked brisket: This is the MUST get - I actually got double for my platter.  It's flavorful, tender, and has that beautiful pink ring.  It's the moist version so not exactly lean but I have never gone for lean brisket - the fattier the better in my world! 2. Pulled pork: Solid although not as great as the brisket.  You can get the BBQ sauce on or on the side. 3. Mac & Cheese: Not bad but not great - a bit on the bland side. 4. Hush puppies: Decent but not that fantastic. It serves its purpose. 5. Cornbread:  Decent but slightly dry  Portions are pretty geenrous for the airport and a 3 meat platter can easily feed 2 - there was definitely at least a pound of meat!  Overall, a great option at CLT vs the standard airport fare.",

I stopped here Monday night while on a layover between Sint Maarten and Buffalo. The line here was a decent size and every single person in line wanted the same thing I did, chicken. Come to find out they were out of every single form of chicken, so instead of being nice about it all the staff members just acted irritated that everyone wanted chicken and not BBQ Turkey. I'm not one to fuss so I took the BBQ Turkey with a side of macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and some hush puppies and called it a day. Asking questions seemed painful to the employees and they even seemed annoyed when I asked what one of the unlabeled dishes were, makes sense right? Once I got my drink and paid, I at least thought this place could redeem themselves with some good food.......and then I took a bite. Guess what? The food wasn't good. It was a mixture of cold/Luke warm meat and cheese and hush puppies that were both rock hard and warm at the same time. The mashed potatoes tasted as bland as could be and when you also took into consideration that they were cold, well, they were bad also. The Turkey wasn't good, the macaroni and cheese wasn't good, and when you mix that with some real crappy service you get a total fail for a meal.  I would not recommend coming here, there are plenty of other options in this airport.",

The biscuits weren't fluffy, the gravy had an overwhelmingly over salted taste to it and the eggs were cold and flavorless. It is as if they cheapened them up with excessive amounts of water. The hash browns were decent, a little overly greasy but not too bad.   Definitely a meal I wish I could take back. Especially since this wasn't a cheap meal by any means.",

I go through Charlotte airport a lot for connecting flights and this has become my go-to spot for food. They offer BBQ platters that are enormous. The standard platter includes 1 meat, 2 sides, choice of cornbread or hush puppies, and a fried pickle. You can add another meat for an additional cost. I recommend the smoked brisket the most, although there is a good amount of fat on it, so beware if you don't like that.

I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but was swayed by all these other reviews. I'd say it was mediocre, slightly overpriced, but edible. I ate here once, and it was the first (and probably the last) time I will eat here. Next time I will go to Papa John's or grab a burrito.  The chicken was burnt see my picture of the chicken camouflaged against the black plate) It was more or less edible though, it wasn't much tastier than getting rotisserie chicken from Costco and throwing BBQ sauce on it.  The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese were okay - edible, but didn't leave me craving more.  Just okay, wouldn't come back here again. I think Salt Lick in the Austin airport has better BBQ food. Maybe I came on an off-night but I think I'll stick to other choices next time.",

I've had other BBQ pulled porks and beef brisket it wasn't as strong as what I tasted. Server was fast. I didn't like the fact I had to help an older woman because the server didn't understand what she wanted to eat. Once I gave her my advice she then ordered. But, after she walked away the server started to make fun of the older woman. That wasn't very nice. The puppies were spot on along with the beans. Fried pickle was good too. I had to leave 1/4 pound of the 1 pound plate behind because I could not finish. Overall, with service, food prep, and some pretty good side dishes. 3 Stars at best. I did want to do more but I couldn't enjoy the meats.",

If I am in the Charlotte airport again, I would stop by for a vegetable plate.  (Vegetarians beware-- most of their veggies seem to have meat products).  The deserts were solid-- get the pecan pie. You will close your eyes and swear that you stopped at Grandma's house on Thanksgiving.  Service was about what I'd expect at an airport-- prompt but not spectacular.

I chose the 2-meat plate with brisket and pulled pork, as well as two (2) sides and a fried pickle. The brisket and pulled pork were slightly dry, but tasted much better than I expected for airport BBQ. The brisket was not pre-sliced and languishing in a hot plate, but cut fresh off a big hunk of meat. I wished there had been more sauce options (or a sauce station), but the regular red BBQ sauce and a few dashes of vinegar livened up the flavors. I really appreciated that the food was hot, as I feared the cafeteria style serving station would lead to lukewarm BBQ travesty.   Service was efficient and bare-minimum friendly. BBQ tends to be a more expensive dining option wherever you go, the Charlotte airport included. However, I think Brookwood Farms BBQ does provide a good alternative to travelers sick of cliche offerings.",

The pulled pork was a little saltier than I'd normally like, but the texture was great.  For sides, I had the macaroni and cheese and fried okra, and both were delicious.  My husband had the brisket, baked beans and mac and cheese and liked all of it.  The cornbread that comes with is tasty.  The fried \"extra\" turns out to be a fried pickle, and apparently it's delicious if you like pickles (but is an unpleasant surprise if you don't).  We also got a slice of sweet potato pie-- my first time trying it-- and really enjoyed.  I'm sure North Carolina has more to offer outside the airport, but if you're not leaving the terminal, this is a solid choice.",

I got the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with 1 side (I chose the mashed potatoes from their recommendation), and it comes with a fried pickle.   The pulled pork was a bit on the dry side and didn't have much more flavor than its standard pork shoulder meatiness. The BBQ on it helped but they don't give you much. The bun was pretty standard - could've used some butter or could've benefitted from being toasted. The mashed potatoes were good considering there was no sauce, very creamy and well seasoned. The fried pickle was just a little weird. For a little over $10 it wasn't super expensive but it also probably wasn't worth it. Will try another place next time I come through Charlotte!",

Its quick because its done fast food style in the food court but the food is delicious. Probably the only place in here with a line because people literally search it out.  I get the same thing every time - pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese and a fried pickle on the side (comes with it). The pork has tons of flavor before you even put sauce on it and their sauce adds that much more. It's not my favorite style of BBQ sauce but no complaints by any means.  I think the fried pickle is my favorite part. Every time I get fried pickles they are done as chips but this place throws in a battered pickle spear with your meal. I need to look for more places that do them like this.  If you're in an airport with terrible options this place is a savior.",

This place was a bonus.  In the middle of a food court-like area in the airport, they have brisket, chicken, pulled pork, and other familiar barbecue offerings.  I had the pulled pork with fried pickles and broccoli salad.  The pork was tender and tangy, a decent offering.   The broccoli salad and fried pickles?  I've had better.  Overall, a good option if you're in the airport, need a meal, and want something that tastes good.  Don't expect top-flight NC barbecue, though.",

Everything here at the Brookwood Farms BBQ is made with a precise balance, EVERYTHING. I even ate a fried pickle for the first time in my life and maaan I'm LOVIN' it.  Seriously our next trip is out to the south were the food is good and the music is loud! ;) I highly doubt ill be able to eat Southern/Soul food in Cali now... I've been marked by the natives! ;)",

I typically get the green beans, salad, and mashed potatoes. All dishes come with a fried pickle and either hush puppies or corn bread. Tonight (10/25 @ 5:45 pm) however, what guests got was a side of attitude. Being a vegetarian the last thing I want to see on my plate is meat so when I saw that there was a strip of meat on my plate I asked for another plate.  The server slung the plate in the trash and threw my food in the plate. She served my meal with out the extras so I asked about the hush puppies and pickle and without saying a word she scooped up the hush puppies (no pickle) and moved on to the next customer without a word.   My quandary is whether I go back even though I like the food.  I don't need the attitude this the 3 instead of 4 stars.",

Platter came with 2 sides, a fried pickle & cornbread.  I chose the mac & cheese and baked beans for sides.  Man-o-man, that pulled pork was amazing!  It happened to be the girl behind the counter's favorite item & I'm glad I went with it cuz it was sooo juicy & flavorful!  The brisket was good too, especially with the BBQ sauce they poured over it, but by itself, it was a little tough & dry.  But still excellent flavor.  Mac & cheese was the weakest link, due to the mac being overcooked and tasting soggy.  Cheese flavor wasn't anything special either, but that's to be expected at an airport dining establishment.  Baked beans were good, again nothing special.  I'd never tried fried pickle before, & that was tasty.  Although I should've eaten the whole thing right away, as the outside breading quickly became moist & soggy also.  Lastly, the cornbread was just mediocre.  Kinda dry & definitely needed butter.  I also purchased some Sweet Tea, as it was only appropriate.  Nice thing was FREE REFILLS!!!  All that came to a total of $20, which wasn't too horrible considering I was in an airport & ordered quite a bit of food.  I was itch'n for some BBQ & this certainly satisfied that craving.  All-in-all, I would definitely recommend trying this airport eatery out if ever found to be at the Charlotte airport!",

Yep, it's totally worth it.  I got the pulled pork sandwich, which comes with one side. Mac & cheese is it. And of course, a fried pickle spear. You Yankees who ain't never had a fried pickle? Try it, you might like it.  They'll offer to put barbecue sauce on the meat. Your answer here is \"Yes, please.\"  At the register, grab one of those locally brewed beers that you probably won't find elsewhere. OMB (\"Olde Mecklenburg Brewery\") or NoDa or a Carolina Blonde from Carolina Brewery up in Mooresville. Maybe a little cup of banana pudding too.  And find a place to sit. In this instance, I don't recommend the rocking chairs as it's potentially messy food and you don't want to wear it.  Pick up your sandwich and dig in. If it's like mine, it's tender and juicy and tangy and delicious. Mmmmm... that's barbecue. Welcome to Charlotte. Enjoy your stay!",

Comes with a generous scoop of pulled pork with a slathering of bbq sauce on top. With it, comes two sides. I  chose green beans and coleslaw. I could also have baked beans, sweet potato fries, hush puppies, mac & cheese, tomato cuke salad as sides. They give you a piece of honey corn bread (which was good but needs butter) and what I thought was a wedge fry. Surprise! It was a tasty fried pickle!  Portions were generous for the price. They have various soda, water and other beverages to include sweet tea. Free refills which is great. I went back and nabbed  a slice of their sweet potato pie. I could've have just as easily gone with pecan pie too, but I was being good. It was delicious.",

    "text": "Passing through the airport and had a long layover. Was looking forward to eating here as previous experience had been good. Today was definitely not good. My wife and I ordered identical meals. Hickory smoked brisket platters with greens and okra.  Brisket was 60% fat. In fact one whole piece I got was almost 95% fat. I posted a picture in the photos. It was hard to actually get the meat free from the fat too. My wife thought I got the better part of the deal so you can imagine what hers was like.   The okra was burned. Greens were ok and the best part of the meal. That and my Bad Penny beer which was good but this place didn't brew it. I hope this was just a one off experience but I'm thinking I'm not going to probably give them another shot at my food dollar. This bad experience cost me about $38 and was barely worth $3.80.",

    "text": "Why 4 stars? Because this is very solid for airport BBQ.     ---   ---   ---  When you're at an airport, standards are definitely lowered. I fly through Charlotte fairly often, and must definitely attest that the fare at the people-mover-capital-of-the-world is uninspiring. However, Brookwood is a drink of water in the middle of the desert.  It's a fast casual spot, in the midst of a giant food court that's centered amongst all of the terminals, so convenience is a 5 out of 5.   I went with pulled pork, brisket, hush puppies, a fried pickle, and mac-n-cheese. It also comes with corn bread. Clearly, I was counting calories during my visit.  All items were at least average or better. I don't like fried things, but ordered the hush puppies due to the feedback on Yelp. They were definitely better than I anticipated, especially considering that whole 'they live in an airport' thing I just mentioned. But I still probably would order for something not fried on my next visit. The pickle was definitely worth ordering again.   Charlotte is probably the city I've laid over in the most without ever actually visiting. Until then, this is the closest thing to authentic Carolina BBQ I've had. I have failed.",

    "text": "I've walked by Brookwood Farms at the Charlotte (and Raleigh) Airport probably a hundred times and never stopped. With three hours to kill this time, meanwhile, I finally caved it and was more than disappointed. A two-meat combo and a drink set me back $20 and most ended in the trash. This tasted like precooked BBQ and brings no value to anyone that's had real BBQ. There's no doubt good BBQ is tough to find in airports and you aren't going to find it here (you'll likely have to go to DFW or Austin to achieve that feat).   Why was it so bad? Let's start with the chopped chicken. I took one bite and threw the rest away. This surely couldn't have been chicken (photo attached). It was dry, almost like a dried out sloppy Joe, yet worse. The turkey was overcooked and dry as well. As for the sides the sweet potato fries were clearly frozen and from a bag although the corn wasn't bad and the sweet sauce that comes with it is fine.   If you eat at fast food places like McDonalds you'll think this is good BBQ, but if you've even been to places in Charlotte like Mac's, Jim N Nicks or Midwood avoid a bite here. This is even a grade lower than Sonny's BBQ Pit and makes Shane's Rib Shack look good.",

Today I got to try the BBQ for lunch. It was awesome! I have been to many stand alone barbecue restaurants that aren't as good as this airport location.  I got a two meat platter with chopped barbecue and chopped chicken. Both were juicy and moist and delicious. The macaroni and cheese and green beans were also both good. The cornbread was pretty dry so I couldn't finish it.   It's a little pricey, of course, but that's what happens in airports. If I am back in the airport for lunch or dinner, I will definitely be back.",
