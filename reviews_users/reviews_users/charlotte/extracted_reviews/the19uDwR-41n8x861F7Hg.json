Love the food and drink options here! A few suggestions:   - Do the Hibachi over the sushi. The sushi is fine, but the Hibachi is very light and delicious unlike most Asian restaurants.  - Order the Blue Cheese Calamari as an appetizer! SO delicious - The Zen Mojito and the Ly-Chee Martini are great as well.   I live nearby so every time I get lazy about not wanting to drive, I come over here. Which is a good thing!",

That was really unsatisfying.\" The last straw was when I got a bento box for lunch (which is a really great deal if the food was more satisfying) and the dessert that came with it was old leftover tres leches cake that was spit-out awful.  (Note: I have had fresh tres leches cake there once that was the only highlight of dinner).  The family who runs it is friendly and they used to own Sole Spanish which was great and I miss the ability to go there now, especially since there's now no Spanish places north of 485 that I know of. But they integrated some of their Sole stuff on the Zen menu, so it's a melange of asian and spanish. That's just bananas. I guess I'm more of a purist - call me a fuddy duddy. If the sign says asian fusion, I want you to do it really really well.  Instead you get either weird or mediocre takes on dishes.   I do like their drink menu and location but I can cook so much better at home, so I'm quitting you, Zen.",

A couple meals that stand out in my mind is the Japanese Teriyaki Scallops - they give you such a great portion of scallops, cooked perfectly and the sauce is the best ever - and the Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodle. I've also had some dishes from the Mexican portion of the menu, but I must say the Asian food is my favorite. The atmosphere is great, perfect for date night. Only complaint is that they do not know how to handle a packed restaurant, and there is barely a waiting area. However, if you make reservations you shouldn't have an issue. The service is wonderful!

The interior is comfortable... not too loud or dinghy... it is well adorned sans anything garish.   Will I come back? Yes... the prices are VERY reasonable, the service is great and I won't judge the entire menu on one order... more follow-up reviews to come.",

    "text": "We went to Zen Asian Fusion last night for a holiday celebration for one of the boards my husband is on.  It was my first time and we enjoyed it quite a bit.  The party organizers had ordered the food for us, so I didn't get a chance to look at the menu and make my own choice, but they made good choices.  Here are my thoughts:  Ambiance We sat in the outdoor area which was ready for the winter with a nice, very warm heater and plastic around the outside.  I LOVE that, so that was fun.  The staff were also very friendly and attentive, so big thumbs up for that.  Food I started with the Thai soup which was great.  It's exactly the sort of soup I like: lots of yummy broth with good veggies and a little bit of shrimp.  It was nice and spicy, too.  My husband nearly licked his soup bowl, it was so good. For dinner, we had a family style serving of 4 platters:  Chicken basil, paella, sauteed veggies and beef and broccoli.  We also had brown and white rice.  I didn't try the beef and broccoli, but the other table members liked it.  The other dishes were fine, and I added some hot chili sauce to make them a bit more spicy.  Maybe because I am used to Dim Sum (down on Central in Plaza-Midwood), I liked the dishes, but they weren't outstanding.  I didn't eat dessert, but everyone else had the tres leches cake and pretty much scraped their plates clean.  (I take that as a good sign)  Overall, I would go back there for a fun scene and for a variety of foods they offered for picky members.  I do know that the son of one friend of ours went to this place over 200 times in one year!  WOW!!!  That's some loyalty right there, so clearly, this place is a darling of lots of folks!",

    "text": "Update: I think this is the first place I felt obliged to go back and increase from my original rating. While I stand by my original opinion with the Pad Thai, I've since been back several times and have to say that I really really enjoy both versions of their Paella (they have the traditional seafood and then a meat one). I have also really liked their Churrasco de Cerdo with the chimichurri sauce. With these three options, I have no problems coming back. The service has always been really friendly too.  I was a bit thrown by the menu at first because I expected Asian and they had a lot of dishes touting Spanish rice. Then I saw it was an Asian, Spanish Fusion. After that all made sense I went for the safety of the Pad Thai because my wallet was clenching and to be to much more adventurous would have exceeded my already stretched budget. Truthfully, I have had much better Pad Thai for half the price. There was zero spice to it and the chicken was rubbery. Pad Thai is not supposed to be a spicy dish but is supposed to be spiced just a tad to provide some nice flavoring. It was noticeably absent. Everyone enjoyed their dish but no one seemed to be blown away. The ambiance of the place was really really nice and would actually make a great date spot. I would not complain if a group I was with chose this as our dinner destination and would probably try to swing for something a bit more risky. But for the price and what I got, I have had much better.",

Sushi roll was very cheaply presented and portion size was something they should have been embarrassed to serve. They were aware of our tables dissatisfaction and offered our large party on the house desserts and each a 10 dollar gift certificate. Nice of them to do- but I would NEVER eat here again.",

There are lots regular customers who comes 3 or 4 times a week for years. There is a variety of selections from the menu such as sushi, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese (btw, yummy pho) and Spanish food.  The owner used to own Sole Spanish Grille down the street and decided to combine the two restaurants.  Therefore, you will not be bored with the menu selections and the daily specials Zen has to offer.  I would recommend you close your eyes, point your finger, and order your food.

    "text": "So this neighborhood spot tries to be all asian to all people, and it does an OK job on most points.  Will you get gourmet fare here that excites the senses?  No.  But you will get a range of dishes that are executed fairly well and service that is neither too fast nor too slow.  I work in the area, so I end up eating lunch here every few weeks.  While I have my favorite dishes, my co-workers order a fair range of things that are good for comparison sake.  I prefer the green curry dishes, while the hibachi grills seem to be popular amongst my peers.  There is a portion of the menu for Thai and a number of more \"traditional\" (meaning American-ized) chinese dishes (kung-pao, sesame chicken, etc.)  The one thing that I do find disappointing, though, is their sushi.  Very generic maki rolls that lack any adventure or flavor to me (think California Roll).  No sashimi that I have seen.  Besides, Charlotte has much better sushi, even in the same neighborhood, so skip that if you go here.  If you want a little bit of a lot of things, they also have a Bento Box lunch that includes a small salad and dessert.  It's a little pricer, but not bad if you are indecisive.    Appetizers are good here- steamed endamame and seaweed salad are both prepared well and rank as my favorites.    Decor is modern and not overdone, dark woods with a nice bar in the background.    I'd rate this place higher but sadly, there is nothing \"fusion\" about it- no adventure, nothing new happening in the kitchen.  The menu is really a listing of a number of many different dishes, grouped by country of origin, that never intermingle.  You've likely seen and had many of them before.  It's that safety that holds this place back.  Execution of what is there is good, for the most part, but there is a total lack of imagination here that keeps this place from being a destination of choice.  For now, it's a place of convenience.",

To be fair the misses have usually been at lunch and when I order the more watered down Asian choices that they have! Things I highly recommend are: -Pot Stickers -Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna -Churrasco de Cerde -Kung Pao  These dishes have always been great every time I have had them, those and the Tres Leches... it is to die for!! The staff is fantastic and I love the entire Zen family, and they will remember who you are and take very good care of you.

And flavor it did have-just not garlic flav-wth? It tasted good but just not what I was expecting, The portion sizes were huge though for $10 it was enough for dinner and leftovers for lunch. I really wish their sushi was a little cheaper though, I love sushi but for those prices I just can't swing it and would rather go elsewhere.

    "text": "After dinner last night, I realized I had been to Zen a dozen times and I felt it was finally time to give Zen some recognition.  It's next to my yoga studio so it's always been a great spot to grab a bite with my friend after class.  There is a reason why it is often described as a little \"neighborhood gem\" -  it's exactly that. You will be greeted with a smile and - speaking from my experiences - the service is always great.    I glimpsed over some other reviews and a lot of people seem really stuck on the concept of having Spanish and Asian on the same menu.  So, for those new to Charlotte, I'll give you a little history on how that came to be. You probably already know that Spanish food is still hard to come by in Charlotte - well, back in the early 2000's the owner of Zen used to have another gem called Sole Spanish Grille (down the street where Kid Cashew just opened), it was sister restaurant to Miro Spanish Grille, which if I'm right is Zagat rated and still thriving in Ballantyne.  At the time having just returned from living in Spain, Sole was one of my absolute favorite spots - especially since nobody else in Charlotte seemed to have an affinity for Spanish cuisine.  I was gutted when I heard they were closing because the building had gotten bought by a new patron.    HOWEVER the result of this was Zen - and as a former patron and fan of Sole, that already set the bar high for me.  Zen gets five stars simply for essentially being a part of our neighborhood for more than a decade - and for continuing to fill that void in our city for Spanish cuisine.  We have to appreciate restaurants for the passion behind them and for what they bring to markets they serve.  A five star review doesn't mean it has to be a five star restaurant.  I have been to Michelin star restaurants, and if you learn anything from that is that they don't follow the rules.  Zen isn't trying to break barriers by putting Asian and Spanish on the same menu - to me, it is a great Spanish restaurant that has reinvented itself to include an Asian fare, a solid choice for good food and an unpretentious dining experience.",

Turns out they take call aheads and the lady that answered the phone was really helpful by telling us we would only have to wait 15 minutes. Once we arrived the manager greeted us saying the table would be ready in about 5 minutes. He then offered us the bar while waiting and the drink prices were surprisingly reasonable! Aside from drinks, the sushi was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was cozy!   Definitely making this one of our date night spots from now on.

It's a quiet little restaurant decorated beautifully and modern. We were immediately greeted by the host, who suggested patio seating and we happily obliged since it felt amazing out. Nathan, our server, came out as soon as we were settled and said he would return with two waters.   I did not order any tapas but my friend ordered the seaweed salad and ate every bite.   We needed some time to look over the menu since we hadn't been there before. Nathan asked what we liked and have us suggestions. I ordered the Mongolian Fried Noodles and my friend let our server surprise her with her meal.   The food came out surprisingly fast - like seven minutes. The presentation was amazing and the dishes were PHENOMENAL! We had read several reviews recommending the tres leches so, naturally, we ordered one to split. Nathan boxed up our meals (huge portions) and brought us the most delightful cake to grace my taste buds. I kid you not - we ate the cake in two minutes flat.   Long story short, the food and service were amazing & we will be returning very soon!",

I've been here numerous times, with family, friends, and most recently, my boyfriend, who is very picky when it comes to restaurants, and its been a hit, every single time. The food is DELICIOUS and the service is great.   Most recently, I was here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. We had been planning to go somewhere else for dinner, but changed our minds at the last minute, and we were so happy we did! We easily made a reservation and were seated almost immediately upon arrival. Our server was very sweet and made sure to make us feel very welcome.   The food was perfect. We ordered the Piquillos (peppers sauteed with goat cheese which simply melt in your mouth) and the Patatas Bravas as appetizers and split the Paella de Carne for our main course. The paella was HUGE (we ordered the small plate) and very flavorful. I've never seen my boyfriend so satisfied with a dinner! He loved it. The icing on the cake was the tres leches we split for dessert. It was divine. Moist, smooth, and everything tres leches should be. We left with a promise to return soon.   Thank you Zen, for a lovely Valentine's Day dinner!",

We also got their sangria which was on special and that was pretty good in addition. There was indoor seating as well as it appeared to be a half covered outdoor patio, although we didn't go out there.  I will definitely be returning and it wont be too long before I do! :)",

All of David's recommendations were incredible!  We started with the red dragon roll and sushi nachos followed by the sea bass and my husband had the beef tenderloin.  All excellent recommendations!

They refilled our waters every time we took a couple of sips, the waitress was very sweet, and the owner checked up on all the tables to make sure everyone was happy.  We ordered: - steamed potstickers (I think there were 6 of them for $4, great!) - muscles (I don't remember the actual name of the tapas, but the sauce was amazing!!) - firecracker roll (my least fave out of the four but still good) - Bruce Lee roll - Get it, you'll love it!",

The owner or manager came and ask us about my food I told her it was all good except the steak an it was horrible. Well she got her parties in a wand and started correcting me calling me names and being down right ugly. For the first time in my life I was completely speechless.

There are a couple of great things that this place has going on:  The decor is pretty cool...modern bar and nice outdoor space. Incredibly friendly staff...always great when everyone you encounter is smiling and nice. Location is convenient...right off East Blvd in a busy part of Dilworth. Diverse menu...Asian and Spanish, which is an odd combo but surprisingly works.  Yet, the food was just ok.  I really didn't love the flavor of my Thai Basil chicken dish.  They could have gone a little heavier on the spices to make it a bit more flavorful.  The mojito I had was also not well balanced and I had about three drinks until I gave up.  The Kung Pow chicken was pretty good though!  Zen, consider this a first date.  I see the potential, so I promise I'll give you another chance and we will meet again.",

I asked about the summer rolls on the sushi menu and they sounded intriguing so I decided to order the vegetable summer roll.  Another good decision.  It was made in a soy wrapper rather than a typical rice sushi roll.  It also had so many vegetables packed in.  It was like little bites of summer.  I also ordered the Firecracker roll.  It was yummy.  I have a weakness for tempura fried sushi rolls even though I know I shouldn't eat them.  Still, the balance with the ultra-healthy summer roll make this little bit of a cheat acceptable.",

Zen is located in a small shopping center off of East Blvd and could be the hidden gem only known to locals in the area.  I have ordered pick up and enjoyed everything and this past visit I was craving sushi and decided to take a seat at the bar and enjoy some good food. Upon arrival I was surprised to see the place was packed on a weeknight, with a 20 minute wait. The host was extremely friendly and that service only continued at the bar. I ordered a martini, half price the night I was there and started with the miso soup and pork dumplings, fried. The soup was good, but the dumplings could have been some of the best I have ever had.  Sometimes dumplings can lack filling and flavor, these did not. They were stuffed with an amazing pork mixture that was flavorful and only better once dipped in their ponzu sauce.  After enjoy the appetizers I decided on one roll, the Red Dragon. Let me tell you this is an enormous roll, and delicious.  Shrimp tempura, cream cheese and cucumber topped with spicy tuna.  Even though I loved it I could not finish it, I guess I enjoyed the dumplings too much. However, I definitely look forward to my next visit and cannot wait to try more items off this spectacular menu.",

I usually only for the stuffed eggplant, and always have enough left over to take home. The sangria is a great choice, and also be sure to save room for the Tres Leches for dessert...I will go so far to say it's divine (and I'm not a huge dessert person)! My only complaint is some of their dishes labeled \"vegetarian\" do have fish sauce as an ingredient and it's not an option to leave this out. Will for sure go back to this quaint, Dilworth spot.",

Good kids menu with good portions. The eclectic menu featuring both Asian and Spanish tapas sounds strange if you haven't gotten on board the trend, but this place should last long past the trend. Traditional Chinese meals-like Sesame Chicken-and Vietnamese-like Bun-are available if you want a standard dinner experience and the Sesame is quite good! Tender and well flavored, it is a bit bland but still satisfying. The tapas sounded good The empanadas were fantastic and the parmesan-crusted scallops in a marinara topped with cheese was flavorful and almost could've been a meal in it of itself. Even the rolls were good! My wife had the sushi-Miko roll-and it was fresh and not fishy. Excellent!The sashimi was good, not great. They have an extensive wine and drink menu, the atmosphere is nice and clean without being over-the-top. You can dress up or go casual and you won't feel out of place. I think I found a new Queen City favorite!",

Went here with my buddy Paul at his recommendation....needed to chat about life issues so we met at this wonderful place! They have a nice selection so I ordered a bottle of Sonoma Cabernet Sauvignon to start the evening....  Then I decided on their Dragon Roll, which was Shrimp tempura, cucumber, cream cheese, avocado and tuna on top. VERY yummy! I was starving so I followed that up with the Vietnamese Beef, a stir fry concoction of tenderloin, onions, asparagus and lemongrass. VERY tender, flavorful and perfectly seasoned!  The Piece de resistance was their Tres Leche dessert! OMG! I have had my share of Tres Leche before, but I have to say that this was probably THE BEST I've ever had! Made in house and their signature dessert, my buddy Paul said this is a \"must get\" and I am SOOOOOOOOOOOO glad I listened to him!!! Many Tres Leches that I've had have been dry and uninspired...but this was anything but! Uber moist with subtle flavors of vanilla and natural sweetness of the three milks put into this recipe. This was an AMAZING dessert and a MUST GET when coming here!  Overall I had a fantastic experience here and simply cannot wait to return! HIGHLY recommended!",

I was really stoked to try out Zen as I've read other reviews from friends and seen their rather interesting menu.   Not sure that I've ever had the fusion of Asian and Spanish Tapas cross my plate ever and I look forward to experiencing it one day. This time around, we went for takeout after being rather tired from moving in and a busy week to top things off. Might of caught these guys on an off night, or it should be enjoyed in-house. Know what I'm sayin?  Here's what we had:   Salmon sashimi -- Perfect. Simple cuts of fresh salmon. Rather thick, too. Always love the different varieties in cuts and this was just fine.   Cali roll -- Standard. I was in the mood for something light and that's what I got. It was pleasant.   Tuna roll -- ??? I've never seen nori that thick, A, and have never seen it laid on the outside of so much rice, B. Also, the nori had a pretty wretched stench. Not sure I've had such a stinky variety before. The tuna was fresh and fine. Should have just picked it out of the middle and went to town!  Summer rolls -- Another ?? They were so weakly wrapped and had pretty nasty tofu as well. Just a huge letdown on flavor and presentation.   Miso -- Just as it should be. I'm a fan.   So, I think we missed the boat here in going for takeout. Next time, I want to check out the tapas",

We traveled from South Charlotte (30 minutes) and it was worth the drive. The servers were very friendly and did a great job accommodating our large party. Everyone in our party enjoyed their meal.

My water glass was always full which was a plus!  I enjoyed my lunch (Kung Pow Chicken) but it was not the best I've ever had. It said on the menu it was supposed to be spicy, but I had to ask for a side of chili oil and siracha to make it spicy to my taste (it was rather mild). It was a large portion, so I will have leftovers for dinner! The amount of veggies was great. I am only giving two stars because while the service was good and the food was fine, I have had much better Chinese food and I prefer other Asian places in Charlotte (SoHo Bistro, KO Sushi). And minus one start because no sushi menu for lunch!  Solid-ish place, good service, ok food. I was content with my meal. I would go back, maybe at dinner so I could try the sushi. I am still confused by the Asian/Spanish theme.",

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend went here for dinner last night because I had a Chinese food craving and thought it would be good to try something new. Honestly, I wasn't impressed at all. Forget hitting the spot, the food here didn't even get anywhere near the spot. Firstly, the place is pretty small and has a rather weird layout. We were seated at a table near the bar and man, did the sound of the bartender shaking up drinks get annoying! It was so loud that I had trouble hearing my boyfriend a couple times. No sooner were we seated than the waitress asked us if we wanted to start off with any appetizers. I mean, at least give us a chance to look at the menu! Other than that, she was very attentive and courteous so I'll give them points for service.  We ordered the steamed pork pot stickers, which were pretty decent. For entrees, I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and my boyfriend had the Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodles. The Kung Pao chicken was disgusting. Firstly, it was not spicy at all, even though it's marked as spicy on their menu. The chicken wasn't marinated and tasted like boiled chicken covered with sauce. The Mongolian Crispy Fried Noodles were much better, although nothing really worth writing home about. I'm never going back. I'd much rather eat at places that focus one thing and master it rather than being a Jack of all trades and trying their hand at everything from Chinese and Thai to Spanish and Tapas.",

    "text": "Was very excited to try this place cause I hear so much about it. I think the concept is great a mixture of Spanish and Asian food; two flavorful genres of food in one place. Our first visit was really to try the Thai food because it was recommended by a friend. I had to talk myself out of paella which I love to try their Masaman curry with scallops which is a stir fry dish while my bf tried the Thai red curry with chicken. Both of us love spicy food and asked the server if we could turn up the heat on these dishes. Once the food was delivered we got a bowl of their chili pepper oil to top off our plates. I will say even while piling that on top the dish was far from spicy. I tried a little bite of his dish and it was a tad spicier than mine but still nothing spectacular. The environment was really nice and I want to try their outer area one day, the only thing annoying was the buzz from the bar it was entirely too loud to where we could hear an obviously drunk customer discussing his political viewpoints from our table in the back. I think I would give this place a second chance just so I can try the paella but not in a huge rush to do so",

The proteins were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was great. I love spicy as well, and the server Justin - who was great - gave me a small amount of their chili oil which wasn't too spicy.  The girlfriend had the Hibachi Shrimp platter which she LOVED. She said the sauce the shrimp was cooked in was delectable.  At the end, we had the Tres Leches cake and Chocolate Mousse for dessert. We were a bit iffy at first, but they were both amazing. I'm not too big of a fan of chocolate, so the mousse was a bit too much for me. Great nonetheless.",

Great food, great service - live music on Wednesdays.  We first started dining with Sole in 2001 it was always a fantastic Spanish and tapas restaurant. In 2010, when it consolidated into Zen (joining Spanish and Asian in one location which is a much longer story) the owners Phong and Jenny created one of the most unique menus I have ever seen. You can eat here every week and never get bored because ALL the food is exceptional.  The only thing better than the food at Zen is the service. The staff has extremely low turnover which tells you it's a tight knit family and they all work together to provide the BEST dining experience (and they remember you when you come back the next time)  Honestly, I love great food and great service and I would totally recommend going to Zen.",

What a great concept and executed beautifully. The Asian and Spanish twists were delish. So many vegetarian options it was hard to choose. We got The Pequillo peppers, edamame, fried eggplant, patatas bravas, zen fusion noodles with massaman curry and stuffed eggplant with Spanish rice. It was all such a great blend of flavors and yummy. The Spanish rice could've used more flavor/zing. I would highly recommend Zen!!",

The parking lot was busy and little hectic when I first arrived. I went for a team outing with my co-workers and the ambiance is relaxed and inviting. While it may initially appear to be pricey, the lunch menu items were no more than $13 and the Sushi menu was around the same price point. So, even if you're just trying to impress someone for lunch, you will not break the bank (always a win in my book)!   Once we were seated, our server was attentive and very polite (unfortunately I didn't catch his name). We received our drinks and food within a reasonable time, so there's no complaint regarding the service. And if you ordered water, then you can expect a refill every two minutes (lol). I may be exaggerating a bit, but for all 5 water refills at my table, I received only 2 refills of tea. My co-workers and I just laughed it off but it may be more helpful if customers were at least asked if they would like a refill or not.   Once we received our food, I was super excited because the Asain Pork Pot Stickers were amazing! However, my food was just.... ok! It wasn't bad but it also wasn't phenomenal! The rice was really good, but the meat and veggies could've used more sauce/spices.   I will definitely try them another time and give their sushi menu a chance.",

The have an Asian-Spanish fusion menu with tapas and small plates available. We ordered calamari and had the choice of grilled, fried, or their special blue cheese option. We were intrigued and opted for the blue cheese, which was basically tempura calamari tossed in a  light, rich blue cheese cream sauce. It was divine. Then we got tuna nachos (again pretty typical) but they tossed the tuna in a spicy aioli with finely minced jalapeno and placed a generous heap of sliced cucumber on top to offset the heat. The best I have ever had. We finished the the patatas bravas. I wasn't exactly sold based on the description but my sister studied abroad and Spain and insisted we order them. I am so happy she did! They were roasted and tossed in a sour cream sauce that was to die for! On top of everything our waiter David was flawless. He asked us if we would like our tapas staggered, timed everything perfectly, gave awesome recommendations and was just overall great. So much so that I called back after we left to tell the manager about his service. 2 drinks, 3 generous tapas came out to $38 during happy hour before tip. Awesome value!",

I appreciate the acoustics as there was never a need to raise my voice to be heard or strain my ears to hear.  Background music was soft and perfect to set the relaxed mood.  As far as the vittles, they could not have been more delightful.  I had the Thai Basil and it exceeded my expectations.  The service was equally as impressive.  I look forward to coming back here for more vittles and more subtle elegance.",

    "text": "I can't believe I've never written a review about Zen....This is one of my most favorite places to have dinner in Charlotte. One of the things I like most about Zen is the staff and the owners. They always do a fantastic job whether you are sitting at the bar or at table. Zen is one of those places that you can go in for a casual drink at the bar (I recommend a drink called the Blackout but only one not two), bring coworkers for a work dinner, have a meal with your family or a casual outing with friends.   The food is always fantastic, I can't recall a time when I got something that I didn't like. The menu consist of various Asian dishes along with Spanish tapas. They also have sushi and daily specials. I can't even name all of the dishes that I've had, I have probably had 95% of their menu and it has all been excellent. I recommend their blue cheese calamari and a must try is the Tres Leches cake....It is to die for!   They have live music on Wednesdays and various drink specials throughout the week. I particularly love half price bottles of wine on Sundays. If you haven't been to Zen, you're most definitely missing out!",

We typically make reservations if going for dinner , and receive a text confirmation. Inside there is bar and dining room seating, and you can be seated outdoors in all seasons. A great waiter is one who will anticipate the customer needs, give information of specials, and convey authentic courteous service; each time I go Zen's I get this from the staff, so this is why I feel comfortable bringing my family back. Oh the food! Right ! The food is awesome, a Spanish Tapas/Asian menu is what you will find at Zen's , and don't worry there is something for you on that menu. I highly recommend the Sole Roll. This sushi roll includes cooked crabmeat , lobster and avocado. The hibaci is also very delicious, and not greasy at all.",

So, I was slightly disappointed for that reason. I was meeting someone here that selected this spot.  It's the type of food you can find at another restaurant, the menu is limited in what offers, a few Asian entrees you can get in the mall of a few Latin menu dishes. The Latin selection is better, but not overly impressive. I feel if they decided who they wanted to be, and really looked at their offering and intensified their flavors and presentation it could be great. But for now it's just a neighborhood spot thats probably ideal for lunch than anything else . The pricing is reasonable and  we had a pleasant server.  The atmosphere is quaint, a little barren in the middle by nice. It's the size of a cute neighbor restaurant, so my review I believe is fitting to what they have established at this location.  So stop and patronize if your in the community or at home and want a delivery service like uber eats to bring you a decent meal in your local area that's reliable. And try the black beans from here they are the standouts item. Otherwise you can find something at least Asian in your local area.",

Two of us opted for Chardonnay to start and it was good.  $13/glass is not what I like to pay but it was good and other places charge more.  We started with the Asian Potstickers and Empanadas.  Both came to the table very quickly, were hot, fresh, and flavorful.  Next we had Blue Cheese Fried Calamari, which was probably the biggest hit. The Patatas Bravas (roasted potatoes in a mildly spicy ailioli sauce) was too spicy for me, but many things are.  My 2 dinner companions really liked them,  Finally, the Piquillo (roasted peppers with spinach and goat cheese) was tasty and came with warm rolls for dipping.  It wasn't what we expected because it was the consistency of spaghetti sauce with a little spinach rather than chunks of red peppers, but I can't complain about the dish otherwise. With the bread, it was the most filling.  I would return.",

However I was told by the server that the Pad Thai isn't vegan or vegetarian because it contains fish sauce, even though it has a V beside it which according to their menu is supposed to be vegetarian. If you want to get Asian stir fry the only sauce that doesn't contain animal ingredients is the citrus one, but it's very odd. I asked to see it and it's clear, like cornstarch or rice starch mixed with water with lime zest. I was also told by the server that the menu is 15 years old and that he thought vegetarians eat fish. The only dish you can get if you're vegetarian is a Spanish burrito and if you're vegan maybe veggie spring rolls, rice, and plain veggies with tofu. We ate veggie spring rolls and left. I do not recommend this place is you're vegan or vegetarian.",

(That goes for their food options and their music choices, points for ambiance amirite??)  I arrived just a little after they opened around 5:15pm and there were already 5 people there enjoying their food and drinks. I sat at the wonderful indoor/outdoor seating spot and was very promptly waited on. The waitress was fantastic. I was pleasantly overwhelmed with the menu and decided on the Mongolian Noodle dinner. This very tasty dish came with chicken and beef and shrimp which was alive...with FLAVOR! This fresh variety of flavors was so completely welcomed by my taste buds. I will absolutely be back to try all of the other great dishes that they offer.  Atmosphere, great! Service, great! Food, great!",

Only negative I had was the curry dishes (red, green & masamaan) were extremely dry and more like a stir fry!

We sat in a high-back booth that provided ample privacy in this intimate space.   Today, I tried the soup over the salad. I'm not a big tofu fan, but the tiny chunks in the soup were actually a nice added touch with the greens. I'm a creature of habit and will get hibachi shrimp whenever and wherever I can. Theirs will not disappoint you. The lunch portion is significantly smaller than the dinner portion but the price reduction reflects it. Eight or so rather large shrimp come with the meal. I LOVE their fried rice so I doubled that in lieu of vegetables. Drowned in shrimp sauce, the hibachi shrimp and rice hit the spot!  I will definitely go back and eat inside for dinner; I did dinner carry out last week. They serve wine and spirits and have outdoor seating which would make for a lovely outing.",

    "text": "I have been eating at Zen for a few years now and although I'm new to Yelp I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it. In my opinion it is as good as it gets and I enjoy dining at Zen at least twice a month.   The staff is amazing and my Lychee Martini is generally on my table for me before I sit down. The servers all work together and there is a great sense of teamwork.   My favorite thing to drink is the Lychee Martini, you must try this!!! Everything I've ever eaten and Zen is amazing. I really enjoyed going to Sole, their other restaurant, before it closed. Since Sole' is closed they have added some of the Spanish specialties to the Zen Asian Fusion menu which makes it True fusion!   All the Asian food is awesome and the Sushi is right there with it! Some of my favorites are: Blue Cheese Calamari Crab and Cream Cheese Spring Rolls Pad Thai Zen Eggplant Red Dragon Roll Bento Box  Ahhh there are too many wonderful things to name on the menu! Do not pass up a chance to dine at Zen. See ya there! :)",

It's nicely decorated, and except for street noise al fresco and parking lot light glare at night at a few inside tables, the ambiance is both contemporary and comfortable.   Of course the menu selection is varied in this theme and most of the dishes are memorable in taste and beautifully presented. I find the prices reasonable for most selections and the price fair given the food quality, service, and atmosphere. If price is an issue, sign up for their email list when there and you'll get discount offers from them routinely.",

Everything is overpriced and the sushi is definetly not worth the price. This place would be really cool if it wasn't trying so hard.  On a good note, the service was fast and friendly.

The interior of the restaurant has great ambiance and is quite lovely with lots of little corners for an intimate feel.  But the night was too nice so we decided to wait at the bar for an outside table.  The host found me a chair and pulled it out for me.  The bartenders were both so friendly and did a great job recommending Asian beers. When our table was ready, the host carried my drink out to the table.  Little extras like that are sadly, not common and mean a lot. The waitress was great, the patio very cozy and inviting and our food was terrific.  We got parmesan scallops for an appetizer and went with sushi for our entree.  We eat sushi pretty regular and it did not disappoint.  On top of all of that, the prices are very reasonable.  We had a wonderful experience at Zen Fusion and can't wait to go back and try other dishes.",

We went there on a Friday night after driving around forever trying to decide what we wanted and the wait at the bar was brief.  I had the Zengria and it was super tasty, but at 8 bucks a glass, one would do me.  Since I love tapas and small plates, I ordered all appetizers for my meal and the crispy crab and cream cheese rolls were spectacular!  Obviously cream cheese has nothing to do with Asian cuisine but the added flavor with the real crab meat in a cripsy wonton skin was a perfect match.  I also had the spicy tuna nachos....huge chips covered in chunks of bright pink tuna mixed with a type of spicy aioli.  The sauce was a little much for me, mostly because I'm not a mayonnaise fan and it's resemblance to mayo along with the excessive amount was a bit of a turn-off.  But, the tuna was perfect and the spicyness was just right.  The mussels in ginger broth, however....no, no, no!  Gritty and bland....not worth the price at all.  All in all, I will go back for sure for another glass of Zengria and those rolls alone.  They also have good specials during the week (buy one get one tapas, etc.).  Oh and I sat next to Ric Flair at the bar and being a girl from the Midwest, that was worth the laugh and conversation.",

After waiting over 45 minutes for our food, we asked the waiter how much longer we should expect to wait (after all, we both had post-lunch clients that would be waiting!).  Our food eventually came out and it was delicious!  I was not disappointed in either of our entrees but was rather annoyed at the amount of time it took to get it.  50% of our bill was removed for our inconvenience.  While that was a nice gesture, I'm not sure I'll make plans to go back anytime soon.  Customer service, especially on the first visit, is critical...sadly, Zen fell short.",

    "text": "Deeply disappointed, mostly due to my chosen meal:  Thai Basel Green Curry.    The restaurant is surprisingly small, yet very cozy and comfortable.  Looks like a good date place.  Menu is interesting.  First pages are beverages, then appetizers, salads and then into Thai, Spanish, stir-fry and a number of very unusual offerings.  Plenty of sea-foods, heavy on scallops and the special on our Friday night was grilled Corvina.  After a lot of vacillation, wife ordered a fusion noodle with chicken and a glass of wine.  I asked if that was Pad Thai and she corrected me as being wrong.  It looked like Pad Thai to me.  I ordered the Green Curry with shrimp.  We split a Zen Caesar salad.   Their salads are entree sized so a split was in order.  Very nice server Rocio 10.  Then I was served.  I was shocked at what was in front of me.  Slices of carrot, pieces of canned bamboo shoots, a few dime-sized chunks of green bell pepper and just a couple of small bits of Basel leaf.  it was on a plate...for curry??  Well, why not, as there was little sauce to speak of.  And then I was served a small bowl of rice.  Huh?  Why?  What sauce would the rice sop up?  I just stared at it and pushed it around to see if there was more under this mound of barely cooked veggies.  Nope.  But I did find six shrimp, which i ate, along with an occasional bit of carrot or bamboo.  Thai curry is usually served in a BOWL, with rice on the side.  Whatever is in the curry is in the sauce.  This might be fusion, and certainly the kitchen has leeway in their preparation, but this was way out of bounds.  I said nothing at the server-check as I got what I ordered.  And what I ordered was more appropriate for a vegetable-consuming vegan.  Oh yummy!    The couple with us continually raved about their ginger scallops and both of their plates.  I sure should have gone for the Corvina.  We did have dessert.  That was my main course and our coconut cake was excellent.  A nice sized slice, orange icing between three layers of moist, flavorful vanilla cake and topped with white coconut icing.  THAT was super.  We got out bill, I put it on the credit card and we left for the play we were attending.  it was when I got home that I noticed that the server had not charged me for the horrible curry experience, but did bill us for two desserts ($8.25 each).  I tipped the server $10 on a bill of $51.96.  It was not her fault and she was a very capable server.  I would be reluctant to return, but am tempted to do so.  Noticed a lot of three-star reviews to offset the few five-stars.  Will look at their review statistics.    Please don't even think of ordering the Thai Green Basel Curry.",

I'm near certain the pot stickers were a frozen product because they're identical to my favorite brand.  There's no sin in that; but you'd hope an Asian restaurant would make their own.  The sauce that came with it was a sweetened soy sauce.  Authentic Chinese restaurants serve this with a mixture of near-equal quantities of soy and vinegar (preferably rice wine vinegar).  The best add a little crushed fresh garlic and chili oil.  None add sugar.  The paella was full of fresh perfectly-cooked seafood, which was a big win.  However, the rice should have been cooked with seafood stock and sofrito (a mix of minced garlic, onions and piquillo peppers).  You do that and the rice is the best part, even though the seafood is plentiful and excellent.  Instead, it was cooked with a sweet tomato sauce.  This left the rice sweet, with none of the rich seafood flavor or complexity of an authentic paella, which is too bad.  In fairness, this restaurant tries to be a jack of all trades, and it can safely be said that it's the best paella I've had in an Asian restaurant and the best pot stickers I've had in a Spanish restaurant.  I'm sorry they showed mastery over neither cuisine.  The atmosphere was very pleasant, and the service was good.",

They have drink specials daily so we tried a few of the 1/2 off cocktails. We also ordered a half carafe of the sangria. Their sangria is top notch!",

Both were delicious and the sangria was a great price ($6). Once we sat our table, we had the potstickers (lovely) and the Mongolian stir fry but subbed the crispy noodles. Everything was very tasty, although I could live without the paella. I recently returned from Barcelona, so I am likely a harder critic of that dish!",

The waiter kept my beverage topped off and was very kind and again, attentive. Atmosphere is nice and not very noisy.

My wife and her mom had the jumbo shrimp and scallops. They were good. The shrimp and scallops were large and cooked well. my wife thought it was somewhat bland but I thought adding the spicy sauce took it to the next level.  My father-in-law had the paella. He said it was flavorful and he finished the whole meal. The potstickers were very good. However, they were lukewarm when we go them. I had pork tenderloin and Spanish rice. It was very good. I would definitely recommend it. Also, I had a sangria. It was delicious. Fruity, but I could taste some alcohol. It tasted how a good sangria should taste. The one downside was that they used to sell sushi and now they don't. I know the server said they haven't made sushi for 2 years, but we remember the sushi was good. It was disappointing that it was no longer on the menu. All in all, it's a good place to try Asian food, Spanish food, or a combination of both.",

I've mostly stuck to just two dishes but I've gone with multiple coworkers and everything f looks awesome. The fusion noodles are fun but the pad Thai is always a classic.   The fusion noodles have a really nice curry with them that needs some spice but that's probably a positive for move folks. Ask for the chile oil and they will hook you up for that heat you might want.   The service is good and they do have a covered patio but it can still be hot and can be noisy.

The chicken was plain, not cooked in the sauce as it should be, the vegetables had no seasoning or sauce on them, and the rice is just rice (not bad or good, really). I did get the miso soup with my meal which was pretty good. The service was fast and people were nice.  Because this is one of the lower ranking places I've tried so far I'm surprised to hear and read so many good reviews. They might be because Charlotte has a very poor Asian food selection that has people thinking this is amazing or it might be due to their specialty dishes that I have not tried yet. Maybe I'll try once more for a specialty but if you were asking me I'd tell you not to get the teriyaki meal because it's a total waste of money at $16...",

Their half-priced appetizer menu was perfect, as there were lots of various choices. I expected these to be small, being tapas, but they were a perfect size, even when sharing with a friend. We also shared a small paella, thinking that it would actually be small. It was the perfect sharing size. I am not sure I could've eaten a large paella! The one tapas, with goat cheese, peppers, and spinach, may have been the best appetizer I have ever had. There was a perfect amount of sauce and ingredients. I am impressed!  On top of the wonderful service, being my birthday, they brought me a quite large piece of tres leches. I am usually a fan of chocolate in my desserts, but this piece of cake was to die for! Plus, they didn't skimp on the size even though it was free. Again, I am impressed. I will definitely visit again and everyone else should, too!",

Most similar restaurants offer veggie/shrimp/spring rolls and do not put much meat into their rolls.  Zen Asian Fusion offers good customer services.  Their servers nonetheless need to smile more but I appreciate their regular check ups on their customers.  I also enjoyed the lighting and the overall peaceful ambience.  I will return to experience other of their dishes and report back. :)",

Our waiter was a very attentive gentleman, who got our waters quickly (and always kept them filled!). We sat near the bar at a high table against the wall and had a great view of the 2 acoustic guitar players/singers that were performing! The place was pretty crowded but not loud and the lighting made for a great date atmosphere.  Weird side note - this place is half Spanish, half Asian. I am not sure I would ever order the Spanish side of the menu though the dishes look interesting enough.  We ordered 2 tofu rolls (not sushi, think raw egg roll but healthier!) and they came out really quickly with a think peanut sauce. I didn't care for it so I asked for some duck sauce - what he brought me was amazing! A thai spicy chile duck sauce he called it and it was perfect!  I ordered the hibachi shrimp and chicken w/ brown rice and my date ordered the teriakyi chicken w/ brown rice and both were great. I'll admit that my portion was significantly smaller than his which was odd, but it tastes amazing! Both the teriakyi sauce on his and shrimp sauce with mine were great and we cleaned our plates!  We opted to not go for dessert, but that dulce de leche cheesecake looked great.... Sad they don't have any beer on tap, just bottles.  We'll go back!",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite asian fusion restaurant outside of San Francisco (and I desperately look for new fusion spots all the time all over the country).    If you are looking for typical uninteresting Asian cooking - you wont find it here!!    I imagine the reason for some of the weak reviews is typical Asian cooking preconceptions or expectations.  Zen is far from typical or even traditional!... In-fact it is downright with the times and has a lot of very unique flavors and textures I have yet to experience anywhere else.    The Mongolian Crispy Noodles is my favorite dish on the menu.  Topping the crispy noodles is a mixture of FRESH, perfectly cooked veggies & meats - but the ingredient that makes this dish sing is the brown sauce that also softens the noodles as you eat.  WOW, this dish is absolutely craveable!   (My mouth is watering just thinking about it!)  The grilled seasoned asian pork is always tender and cooked to perfection.  It is a simple dish served with fresh steamed broccoli, but its perfect texture and unique flavor really make it sing too!  The service is impeccable!  I had only been in there a few times, but the manager somehow remembered my name.  It boggles my mind how he does that - especially since I haven't lived in Charlotte in about a year and he still remembers when I am back in town visiting.   I'm telling ya... If you appreciate unique Asian cooking Zen is worth checking out!  (You may even get a celebrity experience too.  It seems that I always see Rick Flair the wrestler in there at one of the back table.  HAHA!)",

My co workers got Paella and a curry dish while I got a \"Carne Asada.\" I would definitely come back to this restaurant. The service was good, and the atmosphere was very warm and friendly. I would say this is a great place to bring a client, date or a significant other as you can have a conversation without  yelling. I looked at the drink menu and saw they had a significant number of cocktails along with Wine by the glass. This is a definite must return and try some more.",

Zen is located in one of Charlotte's nicest neighborhood so if you're looking for cheap Asian food- this isn't the place to go to. if you're looking for fresh ingredients and great service as an added bonus to make your dining experience more enjoyable go to Zen.

For appetizers we had the empanadas and the gazpacho. Also, I believe that the gazpacho has cream in it. Both were fair and both needed a kick of flavor, maybe some jalapenos.  For our entrees we ordered the Green Curry with Chicken and the Paella Valenciana. The Green Curry was exceptional. It was just the right amount of spice and the chicken was sliced thinly and cooked perfectly. It was a large portion.  The Paella Valenciana was authentic with shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and fish. The tomato sauce was good. While, traditional Paella isn't necessarily spicy it would have been nice if it would have had a bit of spice to it. I had to add pepper. But still it was overall very good. All of the seafood was very well cooked. The portion wasn't huge but it was enough after having a drink and an appetizer.  For dessert we shared the pineapple upside down cake and WOW! It was definitely the highlight of the meal! The cake was very moist and it had a strip of cheesecake in the middle! Very tasty!  Overall, our experience was very nice and we would definitely go back again!",

We eat a lot of sushi and we continually find ourselves going back to Zen.  The fish has always, always, tasted fresh.  I've never had a bad piece of sushi here.  Aside from the sushi we've had the Singapore Noodles and the hibachi.  Both were excellent with nice portion sizes (not too much not too little) and great flavor.  We haven't really tried any of the Spanish dishes so I can't speak to those.  The food is consistently great and comes out quickly.  The ambience is very nice, as well.

We were immediately seated with the menus already there for us.  Wow!  We felt so...important.  Is this what it's like to be Brad and Angelina?  We hadn't been to Zen before, but we found the ambiance was even nicer than we were expecting.  It was relaxing, yet fun. The decor was sleek and modern.  And the service was fantastic.  Our very friendly server Fiona did a fantastic job of  making sure we never waited for anything, not that we were in a rush or anything.    I'm not sure what menu some other Yelpers were ordering from, but we found the food very filling, exceptionally tasty, and very reasonably priced.  It's affordable enough to make it a once-a-week place to visit.    There were so many items to choose from on the menu that we didn't know where to begin.  We wanted a sampling of everything.  We started with the Dilworth sushi roll and a Summer Spider Roll.  I've never seen a variety of summer rolls before.  Usually, there's just one on a menu, so it was nice to try something different.  The sushi roll was HUGE for the price.  I'd go back to Zen for the sushi alone.  I also tried the Thai shrimp hot and sour soup...just because.  The flavor was definitely Thai and delicious, but there weren't any shrimp in it, though, so I assumed it was just supposed to have a shrimp base or something.    For entrees, we tried two different Vietnamese dishes:  the Saigon Rice and the Bun (Vietnamese noodle).  They were basically the same with the Bun (pronounced \"boon\") having noodles and the Rice having...well, rice.  The flavor was distinctly Vietnamese and we enjoyed every last bite, especially the grilled seasoned pork and shrimp that were included.  YUM.  They was very tender and flavorful.    For my drink, I had the Sake To Me Martini.  Malibu rum, sake, and juices.  Delicious!  We can't wait to go back to Zen to try many of their other items on their menu.  There's such a variety that you could return time and time again and have a different flavor experience each time.  Great job, Zen!",

On Wednesdays they have live music and half off sangria ($3) so those were nice little added perks. The musician was really good without being disruptive, and the sangria wasn't overly sweet!   After reading a recommendation from Yelp we tried the blue-cheese calamari. They aren't overly blue-cheesy, and while being decent I would try the tuna appetizer next time.   For my entree I went with two specialty rolls. I ordered the Red Dragon and the Fresh Cucumber rolls. I always ask for whole pieces of tuna rather than chopped (a texture thing), and thankfully they were able to accomodate no problem. I absolutely loved the Red Dragon roll and would get that again next time.   My husband had Pad Thai, my sister-in-law had Chicken Hibachi, and my brother in law had Sushi as well. Everyone was happy with their meals.   The desserts looked awesome but we were way too stuffed to eat anything else..next time!  Our server (I cannot recall his name off-hand, Dave?), was extremely nice and was super patient when half of our party was running a little late. He made great suggestions and was just overall completely on-the-ball.   I will definitely return!",

It shows in the staff as well, we asked for wine pairings and the waitress just suggested the one Asian wine on the menu as the best option with our Asian apps? The service was 5 stars otherwise though, our waitress was great. The food was nothing to rave about, but was good and clean, not super oily but not super flavorful either.",

    "text": "The restaurant itself gives a very modern yet sophisticated vibe.  The waiters are welcoming and make you feel at home. The biggest downside is the food itself. I ordered the Mongolian crispy noodle which I believe was $16. The only thing from that dish that was appetizing was the shrimp and if you choose to order this then I suggest you ask for the shrimp sauce which ironically isn't for shrimp but pairs well with it. The crispy noodle really is crispy.. as in raw noodles that look like they just came out a packet of ramen. I went with a few friends so I tried a bite here and there and I can honestly say I didn't like anything. The Sriracha sauce is extremely watered down but is somehow spicier than your average Huy Fong. As for the menu itself, the only 'Spanish' food I saw were the tapas which are appetizers. No quesadillas or the basic nachos like I expected there to be. I never thought I would prefer chinese take out than the food from this restaurant. I'm talking about you China Jade. Thankfully, theres a frozen yogurt place next door so you won't go home regretting so many calories on food that tastes like it came out of a box of lean cuisine.",

He was very attentive, took special requests when necessary, and overall made the dinner very enjoyable.  The outdoor section is my preference. We tried the grilled calamari, which was tasty and not overcooked. I also had the sauteed mussels (part of the Spanish tapas), and loved it. My girlfriend had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly, with a great sauce.  My only criticism would be the men's bathroom. For the quality of the restauarant and food, the bathroom could be a little cleaner with nicer fixtures.",

Turns out we got one of the social deals to get $50 worth of food for $25 and decided to go there for an early anniversary dinner.  Granted we were there relatively early (6pm on a Tuesday afternoon) but the service was really great and the food exceeded our expectations.  I got an ahi tuna steak that was very nicely cooked and my husband got a spanish pork dish.  Both were very tasty with good portions.  The best part of the meal though was their in-house tres leches cake.  YOU MUST GET IT!  We will definitely be back!",

Top that off with tofu summer rolls and a miso soup, our takeout order was complete. We went to pick it up, and it was ready at the appointed time.  As for the curry, it was just fine. Nothing outstanding, full of vegetables and served with brown rice. I enjoyed the flavor, but kept encountering strings of some unidentifiable green stalk in my bowl. Not the most appetizing discovery.  Summer rolls were not the best. But they did in a pinch. The peanut sauce they were served with didn't deliver anything spectacular.  The Mr. reported that the sushi was actually pretty terrible, and sitting next to him, it smelled pretty terrible, too.  Not sure about the dine-in experience, but hopefully it's better than the takeout situation.",

I have never had a bad experience here. Every time I dine in the wait staff is friendly, helpful and professional. The food is always excellent. I'm usually here for dinner on the weekend, so we usually make a reservation, and we are always seated promptly. The drinks and wine selection is good, but the food is divine. My last visit here was on a Saturday night, and they were packed with 3 parties of 10-20 people so we were informed that they were not offering the sushi menu (its a fairly small restaurant so this was understandable.) but I was disappointed, and my waitress could tell because she went to talk to the chef, who said they would make an exception for us, THANK YOU. Everything on the menu is fabulous, I usually get a specialty roll or the pad thai, but the Sole Roll is my number one favorite on the menu. The blue cheese calamari is also unique, but wonderful. I love to come here with friends or family because i know this place will not disappoint. The owner ALWAYS comes by to make sure everything is okay. This place may go unnoticed if you aren't familiar with it, but you will NOT regret making a trip here!",

    "text": "Don't let the name fool you.  Yes there's sushi and Asian food but they are not \"fused\" together with the Spanish fare and tapas.  Surprisingly, they have distinct dishes from Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, all the way to Spanish specialties.  Once we entered during the early bird dinner time, we were quickly greeted and easily seated.  The decor was nice and probably would have been more romantic atmosphere if the sun wasn't shining outside.  However they do have an outdoor patio that I'll have to try next time.  Onto the food (no tapas for our appetite): my wife and I tried the Churrasco de Cerdo, Sesame crusted ahi tuna, a Miro roll, and the tres leches cake for dessert.  Everything was delicious!  A little pricey but a social deal of $25 for 50 allowed us the courage to try the pricier dishes.  The pork was flattened but nicely seasoned with rice and beans. Ask for their hot sauce to add even more flavors. And no, I'm not referring to Texas Pete or Tabasco.  The ahi tuna was a larger portion than the norm, so at $18 I was content.  As for the desserts, they house make the tres leches cake while the others are sourced from a bakery.  So I'd suggest their tres leche cake, light and tasty and not too rich.  They have daily drink specials, mostly discounted wines by the glass or half price bottles.  The surrounding Dilworth location can get cramped.  Fortunately there is a parking lot accessible beside the Harris Teeter shopping plaza behind the Dilworth Coffee.",

So that's what I ordered here.  I also ordered it extra spicy.  What arrived was a plate of rice and my thai basil chicken in a thick brown sauce which made it look more like a chinese dish than a thai dish.  And extra spicy it was not.  Actually, maybe extra mild, if there is such a thing in thai cooking.  I asked for more spice and they brought out a small dish of it but even that didn't do anything.  It took me 2/3 of the dish to reach a normal level 3.  And that was about the only flavor I tasted.    The brown rice wasn't even that good and I was adding more spice to it to make it bearable.  The meal also came with a spring roll whose only flavor was the grease it was cooked in.  There are so many other places in Charlotte to get good Thai food.  This was more like Chinese and I really don't care for Chinese food.  Nothing here stood out as far as flavors.  Pity.",

She even checked with the manager who said \"they could do the soup today, but never again\". Really!? I can buy an envelop of miso soup for $1 full retail at the grocery store. They buy in bulk and serve it daily, so I know cost isn't really the issue.   My friend and I decided we won't go back.

The mussels were okay. In a spicy ' ish tomato based sauce. Again, I wanted to taste the mussels themselves more. But, they were good sized and cooked well. They were served with soft rolls. I think something along the line of a crisp or crunchy bread would have been a better texture combo.  However I can honestly say I Loved the sashimi carpaccio. We got tuna, and it was delicious.

Hot and sour soup or edamame is good to start, then they have a great selection of rolls. I personally love the ones wrapped with cucumber! Kung pao tofu, chicken, or shrimp is always delicious as well. Everyone in my family loves this place, and have never had a bad meal!",
