    "text": "We visited within a week of our coupon expiring.  They denied use of the coupon, which is highly unusual and set a bad tone.  The experience was miserable.  When you spend $13 a plate at a fast food counter with bare tables, bare floors, cafeteria style service for what's billed as very fine fresh blue fin tuna, your expectations are higher.  This is hole-in-the-wall high school cafeteria ambiance.  To watch them fill a bowl is to hold your blood over a flame waiting for it to boil.  They begin by nearly filling your bowl with rice.  In my case, greens, leaving almost no room for anything else.  Were I not with a guest, I'd have walked away before the process began.  After the rice fills your bowl, they stingily, using the smallest size scoop imaginable, shaking out every piece extending beyond the scoop, and scraping off anything over the top ridge of the scoop, measure out the cheaper filler items and sprinkle them into the bowl.  We ordered the large bowl, so what they pinch into your bowl is barely noticeable and adds no flavor or texture.  Given the quality and freshness of the tuna, I cannot complain about the portion size of tuna, although you bet your life watching them stingily virtually counting each cube of tuna they put in your bowl, feel cheated.  Hotels serve larger portions of high quality tuna poke in an upscale relaxing atmosphere for about $2.00 more.  We didn't try every sauce, but their \"special poke\" sauce tastes like pure soy sauce: pure 100% regular sodium soy sauce.  It was like removing the top of a salt shaker and inverting it over your bowl.  The owners have no idea how important gracious service is.  My guest, less critical than I, said she'd never return.  It was unpleasant, run by people who behave as stingy and cheap, and too expensive to enjoy fine blue fin served in a high school cafeteria atmosphere.",

    "text": "After visiting Hawaii a few times I didn't think I liked poke. I thought it was low quality sushi cuts thrown in with soy sauce. So I had been avoiding this place. Though I decided to give it a try...and I'm really glad I did. I came in at the lunch hour rush and was unsure what I wanted and the staff was super patient and helped me out as it's overwhelming if you're not sure what you like. I got the make your own bowl which was cool as you pick as many toppings as you would like. The people making the bowl had lots of suggestions. Great service. Then I had my bowl and it was awesome. Super fresh and not low grade tuna or salmon at all. Good mix of flavors. Try the poke sauce. I got the rice but they had salad as an option which would have been the healthier choice. It was a tad pricey for lunch but if you think about the sushi you are getting it is overall a good value. If you think about how much a sushi roll is....this one is just deconstructed.",

When my boyfriend and I went to Genghis Grill the other night I saw this place as we were leaving and I, of course, flipped out and immediately googled it. I also decided right then that the next time we were in the area we'd check it out. The staff was very knowledgable and helpful, offering suggestions and substitutions. We will, of course, be returning in the future. It's a little on the pricy side but it's definitely on our Splurge Date Night list. The restaurant also doesn't have music or TVs so it's a little quiet and awkward so we opted to take our food to go. I will be recommending this place to all my friends and family to try out!",

I am in Charlotte on business and like to find healthy eating since all my meals are from restaurants. Delicious! Ordered the large bowl with sushi rice base - large comes with 3 proteins. Mine were bluefin tuna, spicy salmon and spicy tuna. Got the poke sauce (soy, sesame) with yum yum sauce on the side. I loaded up with edamame, Oshiko, scallions, ginger, crab salad, lime, masago, avocado and tempura crunch. Fresh, filling and reasonably priced. My only issue is that it takes a while to build each bowl and with only one person building it can take a bit. But go for the food!",

I have eaten here twice, and both times I have not been able to not order the spicy tuna bowl. Your fish of choice and sauce is individually hand mix in a stainless steel bowl then topped off with preset toppings or individually chosen ones. The tuna melts in your mouth and the spicy sauce compliments it so well with just a hint of spice, nuttiness, and umami flavors. The pickled ginger, masago, and crunchy tempura add layers of flavors and texture that make the bowl complete. The price may seem a bit steep, but the quality of the fish is unbelievable. The portions are not as small as they seem. I had a hard time finishing up the large bowl size. I believe that food like poke or sushi are meant to be enjoyed by their delicate flavors and not as fillers, so I don't mind paying a few more bucks for good quality food.",

It's a very industrial feeling little spot with a Hawaiian theme, steel tables and matching chairs. That's not what brought us in though.  Their sashimi bowls are to die for. We weren't starving, so we split a regular sized Spicy Ahi Tuna bowl and added some seaweed salad for an extra buck. The portion size was surprisingly large. It didn't disappoint. The flavors meshed perfectly to be a balanced and light meal that still gave our tastebuds a wonderful journey.   I will be recommending this place to all of my friends.",

I was okay with that, as the base variety was there. Quality of the food is good and seems fresh. However, I was quite dismayed at the portion size and the price you pay. The \"large\" would barely qualify as a medium in most places. The amount you get was maybe half a bowl. And at $13 ? Portion sizes are small for the price you are paying. I doubt I will repeat and will try to find something better.",

    "text": "Truly enjoyed my experience. It's a make your own bowl of: various raw fish,chicken and tofu, with rice and sides. They also have dishes you can choose from on their menu. Think of a sushi rolls minus the seaweed wrap, in a bowl. Its very light, refreshing, filling \"in a good way\". So caution because just like anything else, sushi can be unhealthy, it can get caloric depending on what you add to it. You start to add the mayo based sauces, and high sodium sauces, it changes how health this can be but its definitely a better option than your typical fast food location. So, again, fast, tastes amazing, great if you want a healthier option but it's a little more expensive than some might want for lunch. My larger bowl was $14, not typically would want to spend for lunch. On a normal basis a lunch would come in at around $10. That said, you get what you pay for, which is why I wouldn't eliminate coming here, just not as often as I would like.",

I took Sweetie and my kid that doesn't just eat pizza and chicken nuggets out to give it a try. Nice place, a bit tight on space, but the yumminess more than makes up for it.  A bit intimidating when you first walk in, it's kind of like Subway(Blech) or Blaze pizza where you pick your own bowl.  I being a larger guy chose the 3 proteins (Bluefin tuna, spicy tuna and shrimp) on top of sushi rice.  The nice lady behind the counter guided me the whole way with suggestions.  I added the poke sauce combined with spicy mayo.  I added onions which were very potent, sprouts, cilantro, scallions, avocado, and crab salad.  Let me take a second to pay homage to the crab salad which was amazing.  Stringy pieces of surimi dressed nicely.  It really added to the bowl.  The avocado and crab salad was an extra dollar each.  They have other shakes like sesame seeds and crunches like tempura to add to the bowl. You cal also get some extra sauce when you're done since it never seems to go as far as you think.  Yum Yum Sauce was a crowd pleaser.  BTW, my daughter is gluten free and most everything can be done gluten free and they have gluten free poke sauce!  SCORE All in all, we had a great meal.  It's a bit spendy, but what isn't these days?  I would ask that they serve brewed tea which hey, you're in the south right?  BIG FAN though, and I'll most certainly be back",

    "text": "Seeing the sign \"Hawaiian Poke\", I began waxing nostalgic and longed for the poke I used to get when growing up in the Hawaiian Islands.  I rolled in to find something very different.  This was more like a Salsarita's style \"you build it\" bowl of rice and fish.  I knew I was in trouble when the very first ingredient added to my bowl was a bunch of rice.  The fish was fresh but mixed only with some sauce before dumped on top of the rice and moved down the line to add \"additions\" to the top of the protein.    This is a pretty far departure to the poke shops I grew up with on Oahu. Poke is a dish best described as a \"salad\" and the ingredients are mixed together with a little bit of time to allow them to marinate and blend.  It would not be unusual to find 5 or 6 kinds of different poke at a poke stand in Hawaii.  Flavors blended with various fish to create a tasty dish.    The ingredients were definitely fresh, and the place was clean, so I'll give points for that.  The idea is great, but I wouldn't call it \"Hawaiian Poke\" by any stretch.  If you want some fish on a bed of rice, this is your place.  If you're looking for Hawaiian Poke, keep looking.",

Everything else required some guidance and the people behind the counter were helpful.  Chicken and tofu were my two proteins and very little of each were put in my bowl.  A tiny bit of cucumber, Japanese radish (very yummy), and pineapple rounded out the bowl. Oh, the tempura crumbles were recommended as my crunch.  It seemed to me that the servings were too sparse, even if it was a small bowl.  With my bottled seltzer water (ginger OH- very delicious) my total was over $16.  In my humble opinion, it was just too much money for what I had.  The quality of the food that was served was very good.  In the south, we like brewed iced tea and they didn't have it.  It just wouldn't take much to brew tea, but my guess is that they want a business that is small on space, sparse on servings, and limited on drink offerings.  It's all in the formula for staying profitable and that is what I thought about during my time at Poke.  I can understand how this could be a great lunch place option for people who work in the Ballantyne area.   I, however, will not be in a big hurry to return.",

Aside from the shrimp, it has fresh jalapeno, green onion, organic spring mix, cucumber, edamame, and crabmeat on top. The spicy mayo and the yum yum sauce makes it even more tasty. It also came with peach oolong tea which makes it a perfect combo. And the best part is they have a 30% off for grand opening but think its ending tomorrow.

I opted for the Spicy Chicken Deluxe signature bowl and also finished every bite of it, I literally licked the bowl clean. We will most definitely be returning here in the future!",

My wife and I were full from sharing one regular bowl with two proteins (salmon and scallops).  In my opinion the add-on pricing could use a little tweaking. On the one hand, I found the crab salad to be well worth $1 extra, especially given the copious amount, but radish sprouts should not cost extra and avocado should be at most 50 extra. Very pleased overall though.",

Came here 30 minutes before closing, so boyfriend and I were very thankful that they were willing to refill the ahi tuna for us. I had a regular sized bowl for $10.95 (choose 2 scoops of protein), and boyfriend had a large sized bowl for $13.95 (choose 3 scoops of protein). I selected ahi tuna and salmon for my 2 proteins, mixed with poke sauce and yum yum sauce. The fish were fresh and absolutely delicious! You can add as many toppings and \"crunches\" as you would like, but the following are an extra $1 each: avocado, tobiko, crab salad, seaweed salad, and Asian radish. I have never seen pineapple as an option for poke bowls, so I decided to give it a try, but I would not recommend it. I love pineapple, but it did not go well with the fish. The radish was a bit dry too. Some of the toppings did not look fresh, but then again, it was the end of the day. Otherwise, my meal was very enjoyable!",

Everything (esp. the fish) is very fresh.  2. Smallish serving sizes (even the large). 3. A waiting line out the door. 4. Packed parking lot and dining area. 5. A $17 tab for a large bowl plus drink.  My guess is that its target market is the health conscious young professional, aged 20-40, who walks from the nearby office parks thereby avoiding the parking snafu. Although that's not me, I did greatly enjoy the Spicy Ahi Tuna Signature Bowl (with sweet onion, scallions, masago, cucumber, shichimi crunch, pickled ginger and spicy mayo). I also appreciated the friendly service, the cleanliness and knowing that I did my body a favor; however as I walked to the car,  my stomach seemed to be thinking, \"Okay, that was a great appetizer, now what's for lunch?!\"  Still, I appreciate it for what it is and who it is for, and as such, I do recommend it, especially to sushi lovers. I might even stop by every now and then myself (but only with a coupon during off-peak hours.)",

I think the price is worth the cost, it's like sushi rolls--you pay good money for quality tasty fish and it's a wonderful dinner.

Located in the Ballantyne area and very easy to access.   They offer two different sizes of poke bowls which is not very common where I came from. The sizes indicates how many proteins you get per bowl. I usually do a regular and pick salmon and tofu (this is literally my go to). Then you build it - they have some seriously amazing topping options here and they are super fresh. They also have a nice assortment of sauces which I find most other places don't.   You can sit down and enjoy the your poke bowl there or take it to go. Their customer service is top notch!   If you haven't been to Poke Cafe yet, I highly recommend you try it!

    "text": "This is one of my favorite Poke spots. Some Poke joints can be a bit overwhelming. The options are great and they have raw scallop which can be hard to find. The service is always quick and friendly. It gets busy during weekday lunch but they move the line quickly. Base options include both white and brown rice and also mesclun mix. You can ask for a combination if you prefer. They have very fresh fish and an array of sauces. Be daring and try something new. They also have an assortment of bottled drinks as well as fountain beverages.",

    "text": "Not that impressed. We were excited to see a Poke place and went in. Maybe our expectations were higher, but it was pretty mediocre. Tried Umami and it was way more flavorful! They even have sushi burritos!   The staff didn't seem too happy to be there. There was no line when we came in either.   It serves its purpose,but not the best as far as taste.",

    "text": "I think it may have been five years since my last review but I need to get back on the bandwagon,  I loved this place!  My husband and I were watching a food show in Hawaii and saw Poke and we wanted to get some immediately! I did some research, I found this place not too far from my house I dragged my almost 2-year-old in...it was clean, it was fresh,  it was delicious!  it's sort of a make your own place but they have some preset bowls you can have and then you can add other stuff that you like so I added seaweed salad, I added edamame, I added all sorts of sauces and it was ready to go in about five minutes... I will definitely be back!",
