    "text": "The Freedom Drive Cook Out is a very special place. The convenient double drive-through, ever-present squad cars (I hear this used to be a pretty bad neighborhood), super-fast and friendly service; all good things. But nothing holds a candle to their 40 fresh milkshakes.  The peach cobbler shake is my favorite--it's peach cobbler a la mode that you can suck through a straw!! (Duh, it's a milk shake, but ommm...) A very close second is the watermelon milkshake, only available July through August. I can't think of anything more refreshing on a hot summer day than chilled chunks of watermelon in ice cream. Sooo good. The servers seem to be having fun too; last time I was there I caught a shake competition and had to decide who'd made the best one. I think I was the winner there.  For the savory crowd, they offer crazy cheap variety platters with burgers, fries and barbecue choices, but don't believe the hype if you're with a hungry crowd. The trays are disappointingly small (how else could they offer all that for $5?) and really could only satisfy one person with a big appetite (me). The burgers are pretty good, juicy. Before moving to NC I'd never heard of the Cook Out chain; glad that's been fixed!",

After a bad experience at 3 am on a Saturday night left a car full of us empty-bellied and scarred for life (I believe the words out of our mouths were \"MIKE, GET US OUT OF HERE NOW, I JUST WANT TO LIVE!\") I haven't had much of a taste for hush puppies, you know?  But a few weeks ago I put on a brave face and decided to scope out the sketchiness-factor a bit earlier in the evening, successfully achieved a milkshake, and lived to tell about it. Since then I've been back a couple of times, but again, before 1 am. The BBQ plate is one of my staples- it is dirt cheap and man is it delicious.   The police officers are totally necessary- partially for safety, but mostly to direct the traffic. (There are 2 lanes, you know, and you can't exit through the entrance, guys.) Look, I really don't think my fear is unfounded, it is not a great neighborhood. Stick with the semi-late hours and you should be fine.",

The staff is friendly and quick, and the prices are unbeatable.    I don't like a rut; always having \"the usual\" at a restaurant, but the Cook Out Style burger is what always drags me in.  I can't pass up that cheese, chili and onions.  My lady had the cheddar and bacon burger in a recent late night adventure to Cook Out and she gave it rave reviews.  I only got to gnaw on a tiny piece of bacon, but it was enough to make me want to try it the next time I'm hungry for some grease.",

I've had much better.   They have something like 36 flavors of shakes. I had the blueberry cheesecake and it was really, really good. I want to try them all but will probably never get a chance. They have some really tasty sounding ones on the menu.   This place is really inexpensive. Doesn't hurt your wallet at all.",

With such high reviews all over Yelp at various locations, including this one, we intentionally made this a stop driving from Mobile, AL to Maryland in October 2013. Prior to this trip, I had not heard of this chain but reading Yelp reviews I thought it would be a satisfying road trip stop.   Not so much. Perhaps the name tricked me, but I expected flavorful food that felt like you had actually gone to a friend's cook out. Instead, the meal was lack luster, plain and while certainly better than a Mickey D's stop, we both (my S/O and I) were disappointed.  The 1/4 lb burger was actually kind of pathetic.   I will give this chain a couple things. The packaging is great for travelers. The tray/box held our selections perfectly without making a mess in the car. The value is great as well, you get a lot of food for your money.   Of course, I prefer quality of food over quantity, so I won't be returning.",

They are very busy, and they have done this right.  Even McD's followed this idea in several locations.  The burgers are reasonably priced, the service is fast and friendly, and the sanitation score was 97.5.  When you are in the neighborhood, you should give these guys a try, they provide a great value burger with excellent taste, and lots of flavor.  I have included a picture of the small burger with bacon and cheese $2.14 (before taxes).  4 Stars.  NCFoodGuy",

    "text": "In the realm of fast food, there can be only one ruler. Thr Ruler is of course, Chick-fil-a (in my humble opinion) ... and the next in line to the throne would be Sir Von Cookout, Duke of Milk Shakes and Sloppy Burgers. Cookout beats out the more well known establishments like Burger Queen, and McDowells (extra points if you can guess the movie reference) because it has that homey, family reunion type taste. The burgers aren't fancy but they come pretty well dressed. It reminds me of In & Out on the West Coast. Their grub is pretty solid and the menu is well rounded for a burger drive-thru joint. I tried two types of burgers and a pulled pork sandwich ... and a shake. Bill was less than $10 and my arteries didn't even clog that much. So the value is on par if not better than the competition. Less we forget the real reason why everyone flocks to or should flock to Cookout .. The Milk Shakes. The 50 million types of milkshakes. Seriously there's probably too many milk shakes on the menu. The cookies and cream milk shake was pretty good and kind of tasted like a McFlurry. It was think and kind of hard to suck from a stray. #pause. All and all, I'd suggest that you at least try Cookout once in your life - for the food. Then 13 times for milk shakes. Bon appetite.",

Your choice of entrees (and there are quite a few), two sides, and a drink for under $6.    When you combine that with the variety of food, shake flavors, and late hours, there's no better option out there.  If there's a downside at all, it's that most of their locations are to-go only.",

I could have gone down the street and sat down to eat, and been done before I received my half order of fries, burger covered in mayo after saying no mayo, 4 chicken nuggets rather than 5, and a soda with zero carbonation at all.   The burger was extremely dry like it was cooked hours before. It was slathered in mayo even with me asking for no mayo. The grilled onions on it could not have been grilled more than a minute because they were raw.   The chicken nuggets, however, may be the worst ones I've ever had. They are dry and spongy and taste like the equivalent of the ones you would get in a school cafeteria. They are not even worth the $1 I spent on them.  The staff could not care less. No apologies for the wait times and abrupt in their interactions.   If you are going to wait 45 minutes on food, there are tons of better options in the area.",

They are the best side deal in the tray because they give you a good amount of them! Always ask for them Cajun style! If you order onion rings they only give you 3 maybe 4 if you're lucky.   Some Cook Outs take an extremely long time to get your food out, but this is fairly efficient. The staff is usually nice and gives you plenty of sauce.
