The only thing to know is that the specialty French toasts are suuuuper sweet (like funnel cake/dessert sweet). So it was a little bit much by the end. But we enjoyed it and the service was good ... once we realized the sweet tea dispenser was actually dispensing unsweetened tea :-)",

From what I was able to briefly taste of my food, it seemed pretty good.  **Update: they made my order wrong AGAIN but the manager came out and stated that she would be taking care of my bill for all be mishaps.

Terrace Cafe is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> and I know I will definitely be back to try some of the other things on their menu.   I live in Rock Hill but drove to Ballantyne in search of some yummy brunch. I had tried  a couple hole in the wall places near Rock Hill but none were anything to write home about. This place most definitely did not disappoint. It was a Monday morning, so I can't really comment on what the weekend wait is like but we were seated immediately.   The ambiance was nice; trendy but casual. Good for girlfriends, a brunch date with your significant other or even breakfast with the kids. Service was pretty good. Our server checked in a few times and our food was served in a good amount of time.  I started with a Salted Caramel Latte. YUM. I saw that there was a bacon bloody mary, but I'm going to save that for a Sunday Funday. For the main entree, I ordered biscuits & gravy with hashbrowns and fruit. DAMN. The biscuits and gravy were out of this world. The biscuits tasted fresh and fluffy, while the gravy was definitely homemade and very flavorful. The hashbrowns were a little salty, but I like salty. They were also very crisp. Fruit was fresh a good variety of strawberries, grapes, raspberries - I don't really like that average fruit cup with just melon & pineapple, so I was pleased. The menu also had some very interesting items like Lobster Benedict, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and a Red Velvet Waffle that I would love to try.   It may be a little premature to say this is the best breakfast in Charlotte but it's definitely a solid standby. If you're looking for a place, this is it.",

Their own take on a Mimosa is amazing as well.    I highly recommend this place, I went on a Tuesday around 1pm so I can't vouch for how crowded it can get but I imagine it's super busy during peak times (weekends).  They don't accept reservations except after 5pm, which is a downer for me as I really want to go on Father's day.  I may still, but I know I'll have to wait, maybe a long time, regardless, it'll be worth it!",

    "text": "I have dined here a few times over the past few years  for breakfast and I always leave thinking it was okay but not that good of a value for the money. They have the normal breakfast fare - omelets pancakes, waffles etc and a few specialty items but in general I feel the food is overpriced. On average it costs $40/ per couple for breakfast. On our last outing, I got the Red Velvet waffle which was 11.50 and I added fried chicken for $6 for a small fried chicken breast. It was tasty but not really worth $17.50 IMO.  My husband had an omelet  for $13, which he stated was nothing special, with cheese grits; they charged an extra  50 cents for the cheese. Not a big deal but the waitress did not disclose that was extra, nor is that noted on the menu. In fact she asked regular grits or cheesy grits as if it were included in the price of the entree instead of saying you can get cheese for an extra .50.  Later in the meal he asked for some salsa for his omelet. He believed that  she would bring a small condiment sized portion of salsa,  but the waitress put in an order for a small bowl of salsa- way more than he needed-without telling him it would cost an extra $3.    It's fine if they want to charge for extras, but they need to be up front with you that it is an extra charge, not just surprise you with it on the bill. There is no way he would have agreed to paying $3 for salsa had he known that up front- that is way too much for some salsa! When we complained, she did take if off the bill, but it just seemed like they could be more transparent about extra charges that are not reflected on the menu. In general, I  believe you could get many of the same items offered cheaper and better at the other restaurants.",

It's a short walk across a few very busy streets to a center with lots of food choices.  They server breakfast until 2:30, and it looked tempting. Almost went for the fried green tomatoes and a regular breakfast but decided to get something I can't find in my neck of the woods - shrimp and grits.  The food was outrageous. The shrimp and grits was topped with fried okra. Very yummy.   Very surprised that the service was not good. I arrive at 1:30 on a Monday and the place was almost empty. It took a while to get seated and while the initial contact with the server was prompt, I barely saw him again after he delivered my food. Took forever for him to bring my check and I was the about the only one there!   This should have been a five star review. Not well managed when I was there.",

Me and the kiddos, Jake and Logan, were wanting to have a nice family dinner to discuss some private business that I won't tell you about so we went to Trance Cafe. My experience there was breathtaking. At first when I saw someone tell me this place had the best chicken and waffles in the world I thought - \"Clickbait, Clickbait for sure.\" So I went there to prove it was  unquestionably Clickbait. When we first got in there was a 10 minute wait but it was fine because I ate at least 20 of there mints. I almost spoiled my appetite. Also they had heaters to provide me with warmth. Those peeps who work they're are nice. They like smile and smile happily and stuff. I got a table for Logan, Jake and I and we decided we wanted to drink something. I ordered a nice Dr. Pepper and Logan ordered Dr.  pepper and Jake ordered a Dr. PepperThe drink came in these nifty cups that were made of glass! We then took our order and I got the good old Chicken and Waffles. When they arrived (after I watched a full episode of Clifford the Big red dog (the one where he fights with the blue dog)) I decided to take a bite of the chicken first. The chicken was hurkullinen which is delicious in Finnish. The waffles were pyszne which is delicious in Polish. I'm so glad I have google translate. Sorry for getting off topic but what happened next was just UNDENIABLY THE GREATEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE! Clifford and the blue dog stop fighting and instead become friends. I wish I could do that with the rat that keeps coming into my house. Everything about the meal was great including the price tag. I forgot what the cost was but I earn enough money being in the Spring olympics. I do the egg hunting event and I earned a pink medal. Anyway I grabbed 25 more mints on the way out and nobody tried to stop me! Sorry for grabbing so many their just exceptionally Jaw Dropping.",

Everything we ordered presented quite nicely everyone enjoyed their meals.  We ordered everything from the fruit platter (served with greek yogurt and a coffee cake), to chicken and waffles, quiche, pancakes, etc.  The only issue I had was the bacon was like translucent...there was very little meat, mostly just crispy fat.  Very thin.  It was odd.  The mimosas were perfectly balanced and the private room was perfect for the 8 of us.  The service was so-so and the management was not super helpful while planning the event but we will let that slide for now.    Overall--solid brunch spot and a lovely environment for a bridal party!

I understand that today is a busy day and since we had driven 30 minutes to get to the place, we waited for another 90+ to be seated.  We then waited 20 minutes for our server to arrive and another 45 for our food to arrive.  My wife and I had steak and eggs and it was nothing to right home about.  My 11 year old daughter had french toast and had to use a steak knife to cut it.  This food was not worth waiting for.  For this food, you should not have to wait at all.  My family travels quite a bit and trust YELP to steer us to great places to eat, but it appears that the people reviewing this restaurant need to expand their horizons if they believe this food to be high caliber.  I have had better tasting food at Waffle House and much more reasonably priced.  I am taking into account that today was Mother's Day but I don't see the food tasting better on a different day.",

We had great service, but the food was just blah and hardly had any flavor at all. I thought maybe it was just a one time thing but we went again tonight for V-Day dinner and the same thing-VERY blah. We started with the crab cakes which were a little dry and had very little flavor. That worried me because instantly it set the tone for the rest of the night. I had the filet mignon which was cooked perfectly but had zero flavor and the same for the brown gravy and potatoes it came with. Just super blah and a steak at Longhorn has more flavor than this did. My wife had the surf n turf and the portion size was decent but again, very flavorless. I'm not sure what the deal is, but the main issue we keep having here despite trying new items is that the food is bland. For $80+ I expect nicely flavored food, not something I could easily make at home. Our server was also short and snooty and didn't even come to check on our dinner until we were finished, thus she did not receive even a 20% tip.",

    "text": "Terrace Cafe has been one of my favorites places in Ballantyne for breakfast and lunch.  I always  like to take people there for the first time, up until today.  My Mom, sister (first visit) and I went for lunch today we sat outside.  Two people who came in after us had their drink orders in before the server came to us - not a big deal because we weren't in a hurry.  We finally placed our order and I asked for the breakfast fruit salad without melon, my Mom had a turkey sandwich with onion rings, my sister ordered chicken salad croissant with onion rings.  Our meal arrived 35-45 mins after we placed it.  In the meantime 4 tables who came after us had their meals, paid and left before we received ours.  I asked why it had taken so long and the server told me because I had asked for fruit without melon it took LONGER to prepare.  When the server brought our food (not the waitress) he acted like he was annoyed because he had to bring us our food.  I told him Thank you and he barely mumbled - perhaps he was afraid I was going to say something because of how long it took us to receive our food.  In the past the onion rings have been great, today there was so much batter and looked like a clump of dough which we peeled off.  After this experience I probably won't be going back and will not recommend like I have in the past.  Yesterday I sent them an email explaining the situation and haven't received a response back.",

The highly creative ravioli was a pure delight. Stuffed with a pumpkin puree it was unique and perfectly cooked. All the other items we have sampled there were terrific also.

The only reason I knocked it down a couple stars was the fact that their non-smoking section was outside.

This is a well run mid level restaurants with good food and reasonable prices. You can get a good breakfast or lunch for $10 - $15. Salads are good (fried oyster, cobb) burgers are good and fried onion rings are very good.  I like this unit better than the one in Piedmont Row, not sure why but I do. It is a good place to take visiting guests as their menu has a wide selection and wait staff has no problem with a high maintenance guest (you know the type: \"is this fresh\", \" can I have that on the side\", \"can I substitute x for y\") all these requests are handled with a smile and fulfilled.",

I watched 3 parties of 1/2 people, who arrived after me, get seated immediately & before me in the booths in the back. So I walked back to stand and asked her why I wasn't being seated. She said because she thought I wanted a large booth. Bull! For 1 person? She basically snatched my pager from me and then sat me with the others in the booths in the back. Not a good way to start off my 1st visit here because now I'm annoyed....  The rest of my service and the food redeemed her. My waitress was very attentive the entire time. I ordered the Chicken & Waffle(Well Done) with Grits, & a Sweet Tea to drink. Hands down the best Chicken & Waffle I've tasted so far. My Waffle was light with a slight crisp the way I like it. The chicken was seasoned to perfection. It was fried where it was still juicy and tender on the inside yet crispy on the outside. I wasn't a big fan of the Grits but they worked with a bit of TLC (Salt & Pepper). They were also very creamy. When I was finished I was offered a Togo cup of my tea which was awesome because that tea was so refreshing. The right amount of sugar!   Then the bill came & knocked me back down to reality, $18.13!!! Very steep for chicken and waffles. Doubt I'll return too often, but it's definitely a nice place to treat yourself!",

They were out of orange juice during breakfast/brunch time and we were given plastic cups for our beverages because there were no available glasses although all of the neighboring tables have glasses. After we ordered we waited almost an 40 min for our food. Order two fried green tomatoes for our table and it came out 7 minutes apart. The server seemed like she was NOT trained in restaurant dinning as she expressed to us (the customers) serval times her frustrations in the challenges of working at Terrace. We should not be told that the additional requested napkins are too far away and will get to it, there are no clean glasses because servers have broken a lot of them and \"I'm just trying y'all\". The food was mediocre and not like it once was. My recommendation to my once beloved restaurant, complete additional training in dinning to all of your staff specifically around customer service during peak time and revamp your chefs' culinary skills. I will not be returning when I'm back in Charlotte.",

Terrace Cafe is a great place for a date or small social get-together with friends. The selections are tasty and there's a pretty wide menu so you don't have to worry about everyone finding something for themselves. Customer service is good too.  No attitudes from waiters/waitresses and they're pretty attentive. The vibe is perfect. Relaxed and very social.   The red velvet waffle looks amazing and tastes...pretty good. It's soft with a subtle red velvet flavor, but aside from the cream cheese drizzle, everything is muted. The boneless fried chicken breast that comes with it, however, is amazing. Tender, served hot, and packed with flavor! You have to get the waffle with the chicken.  Oh, and get the hash browns instead of the grits for your side. The grits (even with cheese) are pretty shameful. Haha.   The Ballantyne location seems to have a significantly lower wait time on average than South Park and the food comes out quicker (which also makes sense)  Overall I'd recommend this place without a doubt over other brunch spots in the area and I'll definitely return!",

    "text": "Decided to try again and big mistake. If I could rate 0 I would. The place now doesn't seem very clean, the floors were covered with food and super slippery from the film on top. Took over 10mins to get a simple coffee. Server just didn't seem to care on speed. Husband got French toast with fried chicken he said it was good. I got biscuits and gravy with fried chicken. The meal was luke warm at best other than the chicken. I just ate that and nothing else. They offered to remake but I didn't want to wait for another meal to be made. The food itself was still average at best other than the chicken, that's the only thing I would ever eat there. They also sat us in the little hall area between the two main dining areas and it was so dusty my allergies were terrible sitting there. Manager came off and took my meal off and was nice I just don't think their food is remotely good.  I have to be honest both food and service was disappointing. We went on a Sunday knowing it would be busy, we didn't wait too long. Was probably about 5 mins before the server came over to get drinks, getting a hot chocolate took another 10 plus mins. We orders and our food took over 30 mins to be delivered. Note the people next to us sat about 20 mins after us, received their food prior to us and left at the same time. Our food my guess was sitting because it was luke warm... Not hot at all. Of course we didn't tell the server because we were done by the time she came back to even check on us. My husband got the red velvet waffle with fried chicken... Thought the waffle had zero flavor to it. I got the biscuits and gravy added fried chicken. Same was ok nothing special for $45... On top of it we both added fried chicken and we got two different things. His looked correct and mine was a chicken breast fried and cut in half, must of not cooked fully because the breading I could see and had a gritty taste because it wasn't crispy. Overall the best thing I had was a hot chocolate. Won't return due to such poor service and crappy food. No idea why this place is rated so high",

We started out with some delicious white sangria and fried green tomatoes. The tomatoes were perfectly done and were served with some yummy pimento cheese. Everyone loved the combination!  So mom got the breakfast casserole which is served with grits or fruit. It was a huge portion and she said it was very tasty. I decided to get the chicken & waffles and that was very good as well.  Our server was excellent and everyone left full & happy. We arrived at 1:30 so didn't have to wait long even though we needed a table for 6.",

However, many of the menu options were the same so I was able to choose from their normal food.  I went with the bourbon mustard glazed salmon, with asparagus and carrots. The salmon itself was very good, and I enjoyed the bourbon mustard glaze. However, there wasn't much substance to the sides. I only got 2 spears of asparagus and 3 mini carrots, and they were loaded with oil. I had to rub the oil off with my napkin they were so slippery. I was disappointed in the portion sizes for sure, and they didn't offer a starch with the salmon, so it wasn't a filling meal.  My husband had the ribeye, which had so much more to offer at the same price point as the salmon (~$19.00), which I thought was interesting. His steak came with fingerling potatoes and brussel sprouts with bacon and maple glaze. The brussel sprouts were DELICIOUS. I had a few bites of his steak and really enjoyed it. It seems his dish was the winner in getting more for your value.   The cocktail list was pretty basic. It was disappointing that they don't have more artisinal or unique cocktail options.",

So the only conclusion I can come to is the kitchen. I honestly love this place but 30 minute wait to sit shouldn't be matched with a 30 minute wait for your food. It's an omelette after the brunch rush.  I don't mind waiting to sit but not after we ordered. Looks like south park is our new spot. Sorry ballantyne",

I came on a weekday morning and the place was maybe 1/3 full, yet our server seemed very rushed and it was hard to flag her down. I ordered an omelette with mushrooms, onions and gruyere with a side of fruit and toast. I love omelettes but this one barely had any filling inside. Maybe 3 pieces of mushroom and 5 pieces of onion? Plus the gruyere was still in its shredded state and not melted at all. On the bright side, the fruit seemed fresh and the toast came with a yummy jam and whipped cream.  It's a nice place but I just couldn't justify paying $12 for what I got.",

After seeing the red velvet waffle pictures and reviews, I had to give it a try. I ordered the red velvet waffle with fried chicken, and my friend ordered the Mediterranean salad with chicken. The order took quite a while to arrive, but that is the only negative. Besides, the coffee was great during the wait, and so was the server. When the food arrived, it was more than amazing. My friend enjoyed his salad, but I absolutely loved my red velvet waffle and chicken. This place will become a regular spot for us!  *Side note, check out the cool angled glasses!

I was politely told the restaurant does not do 'call ahead' seating on the weekends. However, they did offer to seat my party as closely together as possible.  After arriving at almost noon, based on horrific traffic - I found out the restaurant actually did set up a back room for my entire party - what a pleasant surprise. Additionally, the two young gentlemen that waited on our table exhibited exceptional customer service. They were genuinely nice young men and did a great job waiting on us! Lastly, the food was great!! Big THANKS for making my special day even more special!! Dr. Antonio Jordan",

I had the hangar steak and it was fantastic.  Unfortunately, the appetizers and my friends entrees did not match up.  For starters, we had sausage and cheddar bills which had virtually no flavor and fried green tomatoes which were nothing special. One of my friends had trout wrapped with bacon, which we all wanted to order, but she ended up having trouble finishing it it was so mediocre.  Overall, an okay experience but could be so much more.",

So why haven't I've gone back since my initial visit, well because they are expensive for a place that specializes in breakfast.

If you don't mind spending more and/or want to impress somebody, the Terrace Cafe does the job.",

Our host has sat us (group of 4 people, including one child) in the wrong section where absolutely no servers inquire us for 20 minutes. For the first time ever in my dining experience, I stood up to ask for the manager whom bleakly apologize, grabbed the closest server who showed mild irritation while taking our orders. The orange juice is really delicious. The decor is wonderful and beautiful.   However our breakfast came out cold. Chicken and waffles, croque madame, shrimp and grits and a kids entree. The wait was too long. Bland to our taste buds. Our server came by only twice. One to take our order & the second to give us our check. Upon exiting, the nonchalant manager was just sitting by the bar watching the football game. I don't know an experience that can get more flabbergasted than this. I would like to give it a second chance to see what others are raving about but I just don't know from the lack of treatment from this establishment.",

I was told by the hostess there would be a 30 minute wait for a table of 3; however, we only waited about 5 minutes. The hostess was really friendly & nice.  This brings me to our waitress...she on the other hand wasn't too friendly & seemed like we were an inconvenience.  Throughout our whole dining experience, she may have refilled my coffee once, but didn't ask us how we were doing.  We did have 2 members of their staff (maybe managers?) come by to ask how we were doing.  On to the food, I had the \"full breakfast\" - which was delicious. The bacon was crisp, scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly, hash browns were brown & had just the right amount of crisp to them. The pancakes were very thin, but nonetheless they were still good.   I like the details of Terrace Cafe. The neat plates & beverage glasses, the cute, retro hot tea kettles (hot water for hot tea), the hot tea caddy, the salt & pepper shakers, & even a calculator in the bill folio.",

This I can say - the staff, especially Sherry (mgr) and Laurie and Sean are really great and Sherry, especially, goes the extra mile to make sure the customer is happy. Other mgrs and staff, Robert, and others are equally great. Granted we are pretty regular (at least once a week), but I don't think that matters. Their patio is really nice and is also very dog friendly.  Their large turkey salad (unfortunately only available during lunch hours) is without a doubt one of the best deals in town.  The good news is that lunch runs until 4:00.  Their turkey sandwich is also outstanding and the fact that they slow roast and pull their own turkey is a real pls. Highly suggest you give them a try",

    "text": "I don't know why I torture myself.  It's been over a year since I've been to Terrace Cafe and didn't have a great experience the last time, but I thought we'd try it one more time.    It's Mothers Day, and they don't take reservations but do call ahead seating.  We called at 11:00 am and were told it would be 2 hours but to show up at 12:40.  Fine, we waited at home, and since I knew it would be crowded and I hate crowds this is fine with me.  I had a party of 6 which included my 2 children both under 5.  The place was very busy, and since it was gorgeous outside there were A LOT of people eating outside.  We were promptly seated (good thing), and greeted by Adam, our server who took our drink orders.  I then opened the menu and saw that \"to better serve us, they were only serving breakfast on Sunday\", well crap I wanted lunch but then saw they had a few \"specials\" which were \"lunchy\".  My party ordered and we're off to the races.  So we're waiting.....and waiting, and waiting.  50 minutes later, after my Dad took my daughter for a walk and the food STILL wasn't there I informed Adam that I was tired of waiting for my food and he said they \"were doing everything possible\" to get my food out, but they were backed up.  He must have said something to the Manager because he stopped by and by this time it was a full hour after I placed my order.  He explained to me that we were still 7 or 8 tickets back.....I immediately went into \"jerk mode\" and told him that it sounded like poor management to me.  He got defensive and told me that it indeed, wasn't poor management.  Au contraire mon frere, that is EXACTLY the definition of poor management!  When you're menu is 98% breakfast which is more \"custom\" and you're in Ballantyne on a holiday you do either one of 2 things......you staff up, or you cater your menu to some breakfast, some brunch and some lunch which will speed things up and not cause your customers to sit over an hour to wait for their dang food.  He then went on to say that he understood if we wanted to leave!  Who trained this guy?  Was he trying to get us to leave?  He then came back a few minutes later to inform us that we were in fact, only 2 tickets back.  After 1 hour, I was not leaving on principle!  Ok, so the food comes after 1 hour and 5 minutes, can you tell I was staring at my watch the whole time?  My Prime Rib hash, I have to be honest was pretty good.  There was a nice amount of Prime Rib chunks, mixed in with onions, peppers and potatoes, there were 2 over medium eggs on top and everything blended well together.  Sweetie had the Lobster Salad also which she said was delicious and she enjoyed it.  My number 1 Child had the 3 pancakes and 1 strip of bacon kids meal.  We thought since my 2 yr old doesn't eat much we could have her share one pancake but the pancakes were basically 1 regular pancake cut with a cookie cutter to make 3 pancakes....VERY CHINCHY IMO.  It was served with fruit which was ok, except for the bad cantaloupe which was replaced swiftly by the manager.  I did notice they charged $3.50 for a side of 3 pieces of bacon which should be against the law.  My issue with this experience was, with as long as it took to get my food and eat, it was a total of over 2 hours spent here.  The time spent to tastiness of the food ratio was very off which will cause me not to return, ever.  After scrolling down the rest of the reviews, maybe I'm the only person in S. Charlotte who doesn't get this place.  Oh well!",

While I cut my teeth at the Piedmont Row location, I found this Ballantyne restaurant to be fulfilling as well.  The space was once something else...and I ate there once. It wasn't very memorable. So I was super excited to see that Terrace was moving in.   Having been for dinner (3 stars), I direct my attention to their extensive breakfast and brunch offerings (5 stars). I have had several menu items here, but the standouts are:  * Oatmeal (so, so good) * Omelette with tomato, spinach and mozz (if they feel like letting me have mozz that day, since it's not on the omelette menu) * RED VELVET WAFFLE (not for the faint of heart. quite sweet.) * Blueberry pancakes   I appreciate that they're trying to do the dinner thing, but it's just not happening. I'd recommend going for breakfast/lunch (they serve breakfast every day until 2:30).   I'm getting hungry... Who wants to meet me for lunch?",

Ordered appetizer that came AFTER our dinner (fried green tomatoes that were bland and salty).  Two of the orders came out after we complained to our server (an hour after we had been seated).  Restaurant was short staffed, disorganized and running out of food.  A server dropped a glass of wine next to our table and was cursing out loud (continuously) in front of my child and family.  Our server also had to step in as bartender. She was apologetic when she infrequently came to check on us.  She offered my wife another glass of wine 'on the house' and said our appetizer would be comped. When the check came she said they took 25% off the bill.  Frankly, the original offer was a better deal. We didn't ask for a discount but felt it was deserved.  To their defense, the food was good however Grilled Salmon Salad was super small for $17.  Ugh!  I gave our debit card to server before she brought the bill. We just wanted out of there!  This will be our first and last visit @ Terrace Cafe.  Wished I could share better news.",

There was a 25 minute wait and I was hungry so I just grabbed a high-top table by the bar area. The bartenders were super nice & prompt and they always made sure my water and coffee were refilled and made sure to come and check on me regularly. I got the regular Belgian waffle with chocolate chips and fruit. THE WAFFLE MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH; IT WAS DEVINE!! The fruit was super fresh which I appreciated because a lot of times, most restaurants will give you soggy/old fruit that's been sitting out. The atmosphere was super nice & warm and I loved how clean the restaurant was despite it being as crowded as it was. (But crowd is a good thing of course!!)   Overall, the food and coffee was AMAZING, service was excellent and it was just a great brunch experience all around. I will definitely be telling friends about this place!",

We were seated right away, and the waitress was there within a few minutes. Great start to a great meal. We all tried something different, Chicken and Waffles, Fish and Chips, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich w/ onion rings and a child's chicken strips with fries. Food came out fast and hot and all together. Everything was outstanding. The chicken with the waffles was a filleted breast which I prefer as I don't care for pickin meat off the bone when eating it with a waffle. The fish was humungous and could easily feed 2 people. Fries were also large cut and crispy outside and soft inside. They even had malt vinegar for the fish and chips, which is a small thing but it tells you they know what they are doing. The child's lunch portion was hugh, and the chicken was fresh and hand battered. The sandwich was a massive piece of chicken and the buffalo sauce was stupendous. The bun was soft and fresh. This place is a jewel and the price was very reasonable considering the portions. The waitress was top shelf, polite and helpful and we noticed her section included a large number of tables but she kept it all under control. Very professional. I would HIGHLY recommend this place.",

    "text": "The Terrace has been on my list for awhile due to their gluten free options. We went for Sunday Brunch. I have Dairy and Egg allergies in addition to Celiac so my brunch options at restaurants are usually limited.  They offered a vegan/gluten free waffle and let me sub the vegan chicken for real bacon at no extra cost which was nice. The waffle was HUGE as were all of the portions (my non-gluten free friends tried the fried chicken & waffle and the chicken biscuit) and none of us could finish. It was heavier than what I normally eat and I'm not a huge fan of southern food. However, the staff was attentive and I did not get sick from cross contamination. My friends all enjoyed their food as well.  I appreciated that they had options- wish they offered grilled chicken on the weekends instead of just fried so I could have tried something less heavy! Took away a star because it seemed expensive even though the portions were big. I would take away another star because I'm just not a big fan of heavy southern food - Tupelo honey is similarly priced but at least offers more healthy /lighter options.",

About a 15-20 minute wait. Which is pretty good for Sunday brunch. But the service was not good at all. We ordered mimosas, coffee and water. My SIL received her mimosa; however, I had to ask for mine again and after a 15 minute wait it finally came out. I ordered the Shrimp and grits, which were delicious and the fruit. I didn't receive the fruit until I was given a To Go box for my leftovers. My SIL and niece ordered the Belgium waffle and had to wait for the syrup when the waitress made her rounds later. I read the previous reviews while I waited to be seated and that was one of the complaints about the resturant. That the waiters/waitresses were very forgetful and you had to wait on your requests too long. The food was good but the service could definitely use some work.",

That only told me that this place MUST be good. The girl taking names was good at seating everyone on the inside but o think she may have forgotten about the outside table because the table we sat at was empty the 40 minutes we were waiting and it wasn't but 10 minutes before we were called that someone took a count of the tables out there. But it was a busy day.  We were greeted almost immediately and the first thing we wanted were pomegranate mimosas but nope they don't serve alcohol till noon which is very strange for a place that has a good list of brunch alcoholic beverages. At least start it at 11am but I think this may be a permitting issue. Anyway we asked that at 11:45 so waiting a bit didn't bother us. My mom and I ordered build your own omelets and wanted the famous red velvet waffle to share. Our waffle came out way before our omelets which was also strange but not the worst thing to happen. At 11:59 our waitress asked us if we wanted to order the mimosas and we appreciated her promptness. The mimosas were delicious! Highly recommend the pomegranate!   My favorite part of the brunch was one of the bus boys sang while he cleaned the tables and let me tell you he has a great voice! We enjoyed our time here and would definitely return!",

    "text": "The food is good but the service was so bad I would never go back. Today is my mom's birthday so I took her to Terrace after reading all the great reviews. I arrived on Sunday morning around 10:30. The unfriendly young lady working the host station had RBF and said it would be a 35-40 minute wait. No big deal, it's Sunday morning I expect a bit of a wait. After waiting a touch over 40 minutes I went to check on how much longer the wait would be and was told I'd be seated next.  After being seated our server came by to take a drink order, we ordered coffee and waters. Coffee came in about 5 minutes, water took about 15. There were only a few sugar packets on the table so I asked our server for more. He never returned with any. I then asked the young lady that filled my coffee for more sugar, she never brought any. Finally about 15 minutes after the original request I asked a young man bussing tables for sugar. He was very nice and brought some right away. Finally had sugar for luke warm coffee. Drank it anyway since so no one ever refilled my cup again.   Our server took our order after being there about 20 minutes. He was very nice but seemed completely overwhelmed. After ordering we were told that they had a few large parties and pointed all of them out and said the kitchen was behind so to just bare with them. Ok it's a regular Sunday brunch hour, if you can't handle this good luck on Mother's Day in a week. Our server came by a while later to say it might still be a little while and tell us none of his tables had food yet. This was not reassuring.   Our order came after 35 minutes, not exceptionally long but took a while. Would have been better if I could have had more coffee or water while waiting. Two of the three orders came correctly. I sent mine back. While the kitchen was fixing my order our server came over to apologize and tell me yet again that it might be a little while since the kitchen was still backed up. A woman I'm guessing was a manager or owner also came over to apologize. Food came out and was good. This was the only redemption here, all the food was good. If you get thirsty while you eat though, you're on your own.   While finishing our meal the same lady came by to tell us our server was new and still learning. I understand this and everyone past the hostess was nice but, it was constant excuses and I'm sorry the entire meal. It also took 10 minutes just for them to run my credit card and get out of there. Honestly terrible service and on the worst day possible. Just do a better job, it's Sunday brunch, you should expect to be busy.",

I'm not much of a pancake eater, but a good substitute is their banana pecan French toast and that's by far the best French toast I've had. For drinks, they have amazing orange juice and don't forget about their mimosa(only if your 21+).",

    "text": "I have eaten at the Terrace Cafe- Southpark many times before, but this is my first time going to the one in ballantyne. I have never had a bad experience previously, but after eating brunch there this morning my opinions have drastically changed. To start, our waitress took 20 minutes to get the whole table (party of 5) water. We then proceeded to order addtional drinks, such as coffee and tea, and she kept saying \"she'll be right back\"...but didn't come back for another 15 minutes.   We ordered our food- carrott cake pancakes and 4 benedicts. When the food was brought out we were not able to initally eat because there were no untinsils on the table. The carrot cake pancakes didn't have the pecans or coconut (like the menu specified it would have). When asking the waitress, \"isn't there supposed to be coconut and pecans?\" she responded...\"I don't know is that what the menu said.\" In addition, the pancakes came with a side of fruit, which was also forgotten to be brought out.   As for the 4 benedicts, they forgot to make one and accidently brought out the wrong entree. Instead of being sympatheic for forgetting the order and hurry to make another one, it took 30 minutes to bring out the intended order and by that time we were already all done eating. The other 3 benedicts, that were supposed ot have poached eggs, were completely hard-boiled eggs. The finally delivered my moms meal, but the entree they brought out was wrong again. She requested them to just take the \"benedict\" off the check because it was not worth it at that point. The waitress was not respondent to the situation and gave an extreme amount of attitude and backlash when we asked to have my moms entree removed.   After having a very unsatisfying meal experience, with a lot of waiting around for incorrect and incomplete entrees, we ended up getting our $12 dollar benedict taken off...great customer service right? To say the least, I will not be returning to the Terrace Cafe-Ballantyne anytime soon.   To give an example of the carrot cake pancakes I received vs. what they are supposed to look like, please see the photo comparison.",

Our waitress came outside to take our drink orders. Everyone got coffee except me, I ordered an OJ. The OJ looked fresh but tasted just okay. Our table was hoping to get a few biscuits but with a price of $2.50/biscuit we opted to start off with an order of Biscuits and Gravy with fruit to split. This was bland and I wish the biscuit was fluffier. For my meal I went with the Canadian Bacon Eggs Benedict with hash browns. My friends ordered the Veggie omelet with fruit, Eggs in a Basket with hash browns and Eggs in a Basket with grits. All of the food really lacked flavor with the exception of the fruit, it is nearly impossible to mess that up. My food was okay, I have had better Eggs Benedict elsewhere.   To me this experience was 2.5 stars so I rounded up to 3. Unfortunately, the service and food were disappointing. The service was slow and she forgot to bring my friend her ketchup and honey after being asked on 2 separate occasions.",

    "text": "Today my daughter and I returned to Terrace Cafe because it was near an activity that we were doing in South Carolina.  We had someone with us that had never been to the establishment and we thought it would be a good time for him to try it.  Upon arrival the surrounding shops were having a some sort of street sale.  All of the shops had their wares out on tables and although it appeared to be well attended, we found parking easily and went into the restaurant.  The weather was so nice outside that there was plenty of seating inside and we were seated right away.  Our server, Emanuel came over, introduced himself and took our drink order.  We ordered Mimosas and they were delicious.  The drinks had a little more ice than I liked so next time I will ask for light ice but the flavor was very good.  For our meal, I had the Egg White Omelet with the Cheese Grits and this is always tasty.  The grits were not too cheesy but you could definitely taste the cheese in them.  My daughter had the Fried Chicken Sandwich and she said it was AMAZING!  She loved it.  The food here is VERY consistent and delicious every time.  Sometimes service is just -eh but that is usually because they are busy.  We also posted the pictures on line to get the 5% discount off the check.  We did get it but had to question why it did not appear to be correct.  It was only after we asked the server about it did he go back and find out for us that the 5% is only on the food.  They don't give the 5% off the drinks, bummer and no where is it posted.  The tastiness and abundance of the meal, let us not feel bad about that and still considered our time there a success.  I will definitely go back again.",

That's disappointing that the owner decided to pass the cost of doing business along to the customer. While their Red Velvet Waffle is delicious, it is pricey at $11.00.

As our waiter came to the table, he clearly had an attitude and said \"we close in 5 mins so I mean you can order but it's going to be rushed and we close down our patio\". So we asked why the hostess would seat us if they close at 9pm. Mind you there was still 3 other tables inside. We left, we'll take our business elsewhere and no matter how amazing the food is suppose to be, we won't be back. Oh let me ass when my girlfriend went back in to ask for a card to speak with the manager, the poor hostess was basically in tears from this waiter! Unacceptable.",

So we went in at 1230ish on a sat and the place was not that busy they had a handful of tables empty so we thought we Would be able to sit within the 20-25 min quoted..  ... well the staff including management were walking around like they had 100lb weights on their ankles... I have never seen food service employees move so slow ... the hostess or it looked like she was the manager was talking with one of the servers while we were standing in front of the hostess stand for a few minutes we we're not acknowledged or greeted until we kept staring at her for a long time ... we had 10 in our group so she quoted 20-25 mins ... that was fine we expected that... but when 30 mins passes and we see there are empty tables that are getting set up for us  we are excited bc the kids are starving ... but 10 mins pass and they are still pushing the tables together there is something wrong another few mins pass and they are just getting silverware set up ... it doesn't take 5 mins to put 6 sets of silverware on the damn table ... and it took her 3 trips back and forth to the hostess stand bc she kept forgetting to take all the kids menus it literally took her 3 trips back n forth to get 4 kids menus!!!!!! Omg .... Now for the food it was great so good so fresh perfect! We ordered red velvet waffles with fried chicken yummmm the waffle was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside the chicken was tender and juicy sooo good ... the grilled chicken Cobb salad with the house ranch was fresh and delish the shrimp and grits were super good a little salty for my taste but well seasoned and cooked to perfection... the burgers were burgers but they were still good but the fries were super good and the hashbrowns omg the hashbrowns soooooo good!!! Like I said the food was so good the wait was worth it however the staff really should be re-trained on how to move with a little urgency ... the waitress we had was attentive but idk of it was bc gratuity was already being added she def didn't do much to deserve the whole 18-20% of too that was added! I'm a really good tipper in general to those that deserve it but we all Had empty cups for more than we should have and our plates were being cleared before we were even done!!!! I really hope the staff gets retrained or just reminded of what exactly their jobs are bc the food is amazing!!!!!! Unfortunately No pics bc we waited over an hour a half to have food in front of us...",

I frequent this restaurant a lot and this is the first time that I have ever been asked to leave because the waitress wanted to have more tips from the next patrons to be seated. We had breakfast, cashed out the first check with 20% tip, then preceded to order Mimosas on another check as we sat and talked. The waitress then approached the table and asked us to vacate because we were affecting her tips. We had spent $65 in 2 hours and tipped 20% which equalled 13.00 in tips alone. We asked for the manager and asked him if there was a time limit on each table where he said no, we then asked why his waitress felt empowered to ask us to leave. Just so you know we will now eat at the other breakfast spots in the area, NOT THIS ONE. Just terrible.",

    "text": "This remains the best breakfast place in Charlotte hands down.  We went again today, Mother's Day expecting it to be busy.  We were told that the wait would be an hour but the hostess had a basket of some scrumptious apple fritters (I think that is what they were) to hit the spot while we waited.  Well, rather surprisingly, we only had to wait for about 15 minutes.  Maybe we were lucky or maybe she's not gotten the hang of estimating wait times.  If it's the latter, I hope she figures it out quickly.    Also of note is the fact that there is indoor and outdoor dining.  Each has is its own list and its own hostess.  Nevertheless, after we were seated the service was fantastic, the atmosphere is beautiful--warm, contemporary, and beautiful--if Pottery Barn were designing a restaurant it would look like this.  What is really incredible is the food.  The beef tenderloin eggs Benedict make me feel like I have gone to heaven every time I have them--steak, hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs, what's not to love.  The s'mores French toast  and the red velvet waffles are also out of this world.  The kids breakfast with pancakes, eggs and sausage or bacon is fun since the pancakes are the shapes of animals.  The pancakes are soft, tender, and fluffy.    The food and the service are always very special here.  It is equally impressive at dinner. It is always a treat to return.",

Went with 3 friends for dinner Saturday night and I ordered the scallops and risotto and sadly my food was so salty that I could only eat 1 scallop before I told the waiter; which instead of apologizing or at least offering something else instead he said to me \"good feedback\". After that he took my plate and later on when our checks were ready I was charged for something I didn't even eat and they were at fault. After making the night uncomfortable to my friends, the manager came and gave me an apology and that he had \"discounted\" my entree after I couldn't even eat my food and ended up paying 15 dollars for no dinner...what kind of management is that?! Anyway, after having such an amazing service like Del Frisco's across the street from this place...I won't be coming back.",

We were sitting for at least 10 minutes before a server appeared. We got our water and I ordered a glass of wine. When she returned with our drinks, we placed the order -  which appeared within minutes of us ordering. Completely famished, we were pleasantly surprised. It was all downhill from there...  The plating was good, but that is about it.  My steak was ordered medium, came to the table semi warm. Heated in some parts, cold throughout other. Inconsistent at best. The carrots on the plate appeared raw, dipped in butter, salt and pepper. One bite and I knew they were not steamed or remotely cooked, they were raw. The mac'n'cheese was inconsistently warm as well. At that point it become apparent - the food had been microwaved! Not what I was looking for when coming to a restaurant.  My husbands salmon was okay - just okay - he had a similar issue with the carrots and asparagus. The sauce on my child's chicken BBQ sandwich tasted more like ketchup than barbecue sauce. The only ones that were content with their meal were my other two boys who ordered the fried chicken plate.  The service was mediocre - our server disappeared and reappeared when it was time for the check. I would have loved another glass of wine to wash down the disappointing steak and I think my youngest would have loved another soda.   The only reason I am rating this place 1 star is because of the ambiance and the fantastic personality of the hostess who seated us. This dinner was not worth the $100 + bill not including the tip.",

Did NOT have Red Velvet waffles--much as I love sweets, the very notion of those waffles makes me queasy--but all at my table ordered either breakfast or lunch items and all were quite pleased. My omelette was well-made, just enough without being the gluttonous portion some restaurants feel obligated to serve.   The dinner was likewise done well and all in our party were pleased. I did order one of the desserts, which took an inordinately long time to arrive at the table and was still cold from the fridge and more than a little dry (a coconut cake). I wouldn't order a dessert again, knowing now that they're pre-fab and sitting around in the freezer until ordered, but I also don't hold that against them.  Service was better at dinner than brunch but both servers were pleasant, engaging and professional.   We will definitely return, which is not what we said long ago when we last left the old Village Bistro. I think we will begin to incorporate this into a dinner-and-a-movie evening routine, which includes the Ballantyne movie theater upstairs (and which requires a whole different review).",

    "text": "I would LOVE to give a 4 star rating of Terrace Cafe based on the food, but my review is based on experience as the food and experience with hand and hand for an overall score so I average it out to 2 stars. Management at this location is fully aware of my issues that were experienced while I had several guest in town for my birthday which was totally embarrassing. I will say that management was great in taking the steps to apologize and offering us a return visit on the house (which I declined because my complaint wasn't to obtain FREE anything it was to make the establishment  aware of the people who they employed). I will write what's GOOD about the restaurant for those using Yelp to see what's good to eat. - Egg white veggie omelet  - Cheese grits  - Red Velvet Waffle - Chicken Sausage - French Toast  For those who also want to know about service: My 1st experience was AMAZING which intrigued me to go back and take all my guest who were visiting me and my family in our new city for my birthday (party of 20) by making reservations and arriving ON TIME with all guest present. We were put in the little room up front which was perfectly fine however we were assigned one server (also okay if they are able to get things right) and when the people began to bring food out they were bringing out incorrect food so we made them aware as nicely as possible and had a server get aggravated with the order (that was put in by a server) and take it out on us by yelling and cursing when children were present which shocked us completely. When we asked for a manager and complained the manager on duty was very short and said something on the lines of \"this is a large party which we really don't take so people are just trying hard and getting a little flustered\"  HUH??!! I couldn't believe him justifying the disrespect and unprofessionalism which is why I choose to not patronize the restaurant. Maybe we will try the SouthPark location in the future.  My incident happened 2013 but this review was sitting in my drafts and I'm just clicking post. I still haven't tried the other location because the taste in my mouth is still bitter from the situation.",

I ordered the Nashville chicken and ....well mixed reviews. The chicken was crispy, with a great hot sauce but the portion size was very small. If your going to charge $17.00 for an entree it needs to be more than a lunch portion. The sides, including a personal fav, brussels sprouts, weren't available. So they decided to substitute fries.

    "text": "I want to love this place. My husband and I keep trying to, as you have the potential to be our best breakfast restaurant in the area for sure with great food and decent coffee (why is it so many \"breakfast\" places in Charlotte have such a terrible, cheap coffee selection?). Unfortunately, what's holding you back from actually being great is a complete lack of consistency and very poorly trained team members.  As a restaurant, service is key and proper training is essential. This includes guest interaction, accountability, efficiency, knowledge of the products, and attention to detail. We have experienced things such as empty water or coffee cups for 10+ minutes until we can flag someone down (in which case it may take another 10 minutes for them to reappear for the refill), a server saying \"slow down I can't write that fast\" in response to a guest's order, saying \"I don't know\" in response to a question, never proactively checking on the table, claiming you don't have any specialty coffee drinks (which are located on the back page of the menu), saying the green leaf symbol next to menu items means they're gluten free (so this would include the bovarian cream French toast and crab cakes?), and going a good 20 minutes without even seeing our server.     As for consistency, here are some examples: 1. Pricing list for coffee drinks on the digital sign next to the bar do not match what is printed in the menus 2. Number of bacon pieces you get for the $4 side option (3 definitely seems like too few) 3. Hash browns served with or without ketchup 4. Burnt underside of pancakes 5. Different answers to menu questions depending on who you ask 6. Bacon just barely cooked, chewy, or extra crispy (no matter what you requested) 7. Burnt coffee or grounds in the bottom of the cup 8. Inconsistent sanitation scores, ranging from the shocking B in December to finally going back up to 98 later in the winter and now back to a 95. There is no excuse for any food establishment to ever fall below a 93, while we prefer a 96 or higher as it shows the care that the restaurant puts into their quality and food safety.  Lastly, I have a few questions:  1. What does the green leaf symbol actually mean, as there is no key on the menu 2. Why is it that you can't swap out the plain pancakes on the full breakfast for flavored pancakes, but it's perfectly fine to swap them out for a red velvet waffle? (Or was this server's answer another training issue?) 3. Do you have an official training guide or standard operating procedures for the front of house team members to make sure they are fully trained and confident before working on their own? 4. Do you not hire any bussers? We always see the servers having to clear their own tables, sometimes with assistance from a hostess, which is not good. This can be a sanitation issue while it reduces time management and takes away their attention from their existing guests at other tables.  If the above items are addressed to greatly improve the service and consistency, then Terrace will truly be a great establishment. Until then, this morning was such a drawn-out disappointing experience that we will likely be taking another break from eating here for a while.   If you would like some inspiration from the best (and most consistent) breakfast chain we have ever visited in our travels around the country, look up \"Snooze: an AM Eatery\". They are affordable, coffee drinks are on point, and the food is both incredible and fully customizable to the guest's desire. They even do a flight of mini pancakes with their specialty flavors. Charlotte is truly lacking in the breakfast seen as everyone cuts corners somewhere. You have an opportunity to change this trend and join the best in the country.",

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.  I went through a lot of effort to try to have my wife's birthday brunch here. It was a party of 12 people so I contacted the restaurant more than a week ahead of time to try to arrange reservations. They don't take reservations, but the hostess said to call the morning of the party and it should be OK. On the morning of the party I called and the hostess said there was no wait and plenty of open tables. No more than 20 minutes later I was there and there were two large parties already seated which meant at least an hour wait. When I explained all I had done, the hostess said she thought another party was me and they were already seated.   This was frustrating but there was still a solution. The patio was wide open aside from one table that was being served. I asked if we could sit there and the hostess needed to get the manager. She approached me saying \"What do you need?\" I again shared my story and asked if we could sit at the patio to which she said the patio was closed. I mentioned there was a table being served and she said that was a customer with a dog. I don't understand why the restaurant manager would turn away a party of 12 but serve a couple with their dog. I said I could go get my dog if that means we could sit and she actually said \"if that's what you want to do.\"   This is beyond unprofessional.",

Atmosphere festive and perfect for a gathering of friends.   I always think of this as a breakfast place because they serve it around the clock.  It's also good for lunch and dinner. Today,  I had a veggie omelet and the cheese grits.  Loved the raspberry jam they brought with the wheat toast. Sometimes it's those small things that make a big difference!  One nice surprise was when the server told us how to save money on our bill by posting a photo of our food on social media and doing a check-in on YELP.   Obviously I was all over that and had some money taken off the bill.  One more example of how social media pays off!  Two thumbs up and if everything stayed like this, I'd return more often.",

But this review is specific to the Ballantyne location. If I ask for a drink with no ice, don't bring me a drink with ice in it and ask me if it's ok. That's what happened  to me today. I politely told the waitress \"No\" and had them prepare me a drink with no ice as I requested. The appetizers took longer than they should have to come out, a few of the dishes weren't as clean as they probably should've been and our brunch took a while to come out as well. I probably won't be back to a terrace cafe anytime soon. Two bad experiences in a row are enough to keep me away.",

    "text": "The servers were very nice except for one large man that didn't seem to have anything to do and continuously walked past the tables whistling.  We were at Terrace in February and had an absolutely wonderful dinner with appetizers, entrees, desserts, and drinks.  I was able to ask the chef to surprise me and he delivered a lovely meal, cooked to perfection. I don't know what went so wrong in 3 months but, we were back at Terrace a few days ago and the food was atrocious. We ordered our favorite appetizer, the mushroom crostini, and it was absolutely smothered in a thick dressing of brown vinegar sauce.  The waitress called it, \"glaze.\"  This was not how we first experienced this appetizer and we reordered it without the glaze.  When it arrived, the mushrooms were overcooked to the point that they were dehydrated and crispy.  It still tasted better than it did before and we ate it because we arrived famished from a long day. Next, our entrees, I ordered the apple and cranberry pork which looked absolutely lovely in the photo that is in the menu.  A delicate, reasonable portion with a lovely golden potato pancake on the side.  What I got were browned chunks of dry pork playing hide and seek beneath way too many apples, craisins, and a chunky sweet sauce that looked like vomit on the plate.  Two large, soggy potato pancakes on the side with sour cream on top and some chives.  Why?  Having dined there before, I know that the presentation and the flavors were better months ago, I was so disappointed in the lack of pride that I saw on my plate.   My husband ordered the Mushroom Gnocchi with chicken.  He got a plate of gnocchi and each piece of gnocchi had black char Mark's on it and was dry.  Every dumpling.  There were mushrooms- dry, crispy onions-more dry, and grilled chicken-dry.  Not a spot of sauce, creaminess, or hydration anywhere in that dish.  Again, presentation was horrific, why?   We thought we found a place close to home that served beautiful dishes and had a kitchen that took pride in what they served. Unfortunately, that did not last long and we will not be returning to Terrace. What a shame.",

The onions were practically raw. When we got our check there was a $3 charge for bacon and a $2 charge for cheese even though the menu said add cheese and bacon to your sandwich for $1. Gladly we caught it and the server took it off. Overall disappointed with our $50 lunch.",

I've had the shrimp and grits on multiple occasions and can def recommend.  My go-2s here are the steak and eggs or the chicken and waffle.  Both items are super tasty and very fulfilling.    The service here, just like at Terrace Cafe is amazing!!  I've never had a need that wasn't taken care of.  The inside is always super clean, neat and well-put together.  Depending on what you get, this place can get a little pricey, but I guess that comes with eating in Ballantyne,    I definitely plan on coming back, there's no reason not to!",

The Waffle was a perfectly prepared golden brown as was its co-star chicken filet, which was lightly battered, tender and delicious. It came with a smattering of stone ground grits that were nothing special; however, it was obvious from the moment my order arrived, that my wife was suffering from what we like to call \"food envy.\"  Her quiche was also tasty and was served with a decent baby greens salad and fresh fruit but unfortunately it paled in comparison with my order. I knew from experience this would only mean one thing: We would be sharing this time around and the next time we would both be ordering chicken waffles.  Service provided by Mel (a young lady) was impeccable and the place appeared clean in spite of its (yikes!) 87 sanitary score, which we, uncharacteristically, did not see until on our way out. We will check that closely before dining there again, which we hope to do. That does however ding my overall score, not so much though, that it will prevent me from labeling it a Gotta Try.",

Also the atmosphere of the place is great, and is family friendly or even nice enough for a brunch outing for a couple or group of friends. The customer service is great as well, and the wait time was not long. The only thing I suggest for the place is a bigger waiting area for people to wait or investing in some fans to be placed outdoors by the restaurant near the benches so people who have to wait, will be comfortable with sitting outside if it is hot.",

Our eggs were brought over easy eggs and soft poached eggs and when we mentioned to our server that they were not cooked medium he argued with us and said that's what medium eggs look like. Then he went back to the kitchen and loudly discussed the situation with his colleagues (so we could hear) then came back and said \"We will redo it but it's going to take awhile.\" It did take awhile and when he brought us the eggs back...you guessed it ...they were cooked hard and were inedible. Since the main part of each of our breakfast selections was the eggs we ended up leaving hungry and without apology or compensation. My husband chose not to make a huge issue out of it because we had small children with us and we didn't want to ruin their day or aggravate ourselves further. Also, side note, the website claims that kids eat free on Sunday morning but we were told we came in 5 minutes after 10 so our kids would be charged for their meals. That may be their policy but the way it told to us was very rude. The customer service and the food was not great and we won't be returning. Very disappointed as we frequently stay at the Ballantyne resort and were looking for another good restaurant close by. We will stick with the Gallery restaurant located in the resort in the future.",

Ordered hot chocolate for the wife and a coffee for me.  Got the coffee immediately.    Waiter came by 10 min later apologizing and finally gave us menus.  He came back in 5 min and took orders.  We still thought hot chocolate is being made.    Fast forward 20 min when he came to refill my coffee.   Told him to please cancel the hot chocolate at that time.  He apologized stating he put the order in but wasn't sure what happened.   Food comes out.  No silverware.  Asked the kitchen staff who brought the food out to please get us some.    Realized the French toast for my wife had no syrup.  Kitchen staff brought out the order next to ours who also had waffles and caught there was no syrup and brought us some before I could ask.   The food was pretty good.  Totally would go back and try to sit in the main dining area.  With that said...overheard the table next to ours in the dining area complain of something missing from their order to which that waitress said....\"I'm so sorry, I've been here since 7am.\"",

I got the red velvet waffles which was  good, but no one bothered to cook or season the hash browns. My mother ordered  oatmeal and a side of bacon, which never came and I had to chase the waiter down for some ketchup to try and choke down the flavorless hash browns. If I bother to try this place again, I'd wait until afternoon when they serve booze - maybe that would improve the experience.",

It's right next to a movie theater so it's perfect if you want to grab brunch and day movie with some friends. The parking was a little annoying but worth it once you sit on the terrace on a nice day.    I got the chicken and waffles - which was surprisingly comparable to one's I've tried at other restaurants. The chicken was very tender on the inside and crisp on the outside.  The waffle wasn't that sweet but it was the perfect addition to the savory chicken.    My brunch partner had the strawberry pancakes. They weren't really worth getting. Literally pancakes made with some strawberries cooked to the bottom and a few fresh ones on top.  You couldn't taste the fruit cooked into the pancake itself much and there were only a few fresh berries on top.   It's hard to find places like terrace cafe in this area of South Charlotte, so it's definitely a charm! Great atmosphere, great service, & good food (depending)",

My only take back was the icing. If I knew how much they put on there, I would've asked to have it on the side. I don't have a sweet tooth, so it was too sweet for me. From what we little bit of waffle with minimal icing I could get, the waffle is very good.   I would I order it again but this time I will know better",

We were told it would be a 30 minute wait...but we CLEARLY saw 3 open 4 tops, cleared and ready for seating.  Hmm. In the end, we got seated in about 5 minutes.   There are some nice details of this Terrace Cafe.  The salt and pepper shakers are stylish bushed stainless and fit together like some kind of Alessi  design, or modern art. The teapots and bright ceramic.  There's a nice tea caddy with nylon mesh bags, not the everyday filters. The water glasses are asymmetrical, as is the flatware. Pretty.   The special, a lobster benedict.  Oh, but this benny featured TEMPURA shrimp on a buttery and crisp English muffin.  The hollandaise, buttery and just te right viscosity, not lumpy or runny.  (Did I just use the wold viscosity in my review?  How dorky!)  The eggs, poached just right so the yolks were runny and dripped into the muffin.  Served with a few pieces of watercress and mixed greens.  Very, very flavorful and well executed.  For $17, it was worth every penny.   The fruit salad is worth mentioning as well.  The fruits weren't the average under-ripe cantaloupe and honeydew, but ripe, sweet strawberry, blueberry, pinapple, grapes, kiwi, mango and melons.    The not-so-good:   A somewhat indifferent server who was almost smug at times.  We were unsure of what to order and spent about 30 seconds mulling over the menu...and we weren't told \"take your time, I'll be right back\"...and instead, we were stared at!  She was a nanosecond away from rolling her eyes...but thankfully I spied the lobster benny and put in my order.   Another minor detraction from that 5th star...the lack of communication.  We asked for honey, and it didn't arrive for a few minutes.  Two different managers, within 30 second of each other to ask us if everything was satisfactory.    Oh, and the water for the tea wasn't all that hot.  Hot enough to steep the leaves, but just barely.   Overall, the food at this location was stellar.  The Peidmont location is better in service...but I think judging on breakfast/brunch alone, this location in Ballantyne does a more consistent job.   Fin.",

There were at least 15 tables, plenty of staff, but we had a 15min wait with the black buzzer pager. We went over to the bar to grab mimosas while we waited and the bartenders acted like we didn't even exist. We waited there for 10min with no service; the guy next to us got so frustrated because he couldn't get their attention to pay with his credit card he finally just left cash with a very meager tip...he hardly touched his food either so it really must have been bad.

    "text": "So disappointed! Brought family to dine here when they were in from out of town.  We frequent both locations  and have always had excellent service and delicious food. We enjoyed our wine and salad, but our steaks were nothing special. In fact, we were quite specific on the way we liked our steaks prepared, and each of ours, were more done then we care for. My sister-in-laws was way too done for her. And she was specific in her request. She ate her veggies & risotto, left her steak.   We would have said something to our waiter, but he was very in attentive, and did not come back to check on how our meal experience was going until we were almost finished with the entree. He was also quite flippant, trying to be witty, to the point of rude. Being it was Thanksgiving time, we all let it pass. When I mentioned our waiters behavior my family, they all remarked, they were so surprised at his behavior and lack of professionalism. I regret not getting his name, or reporting this to a manager. If the owner reads this post, maybe he will know the waiter I am speaking of the evening of November 29th at 7:00PM.  The restaurant was very quiet for a Saturday evening, so he wasn't overly busy at all, but being Thanksgiving weekend may have been the reason it was so quiet.  This is my first ever negative review for food and especially service. I was embarrassed we brought our family here and apologized saying we really love Terrace Cafe. Not sure we will be back any time soon. Couldn't get our check fast enough to leave. So very disappointed!  I may think about giving the South Park location a try again, just won't be recommending the Ballantyne location for sure. Very off putting waiter. Never had that in any restaurant in the Charlotte area. My husband is a Culinary Institute of America chef and is proud to show off the many restaurants we love in Charlotte! So we will continue to showcase many other establishments like Good Food on Montford as our go to restaurant when we entertain guests. Again, first ever negative review, but felt so strongly this needed to be addressed.",

    "text": "I love this place for breakfast, lunch not so much. We ordered half sandwiches and soup/salad. I ordered the Chicken Salad Croissant which was so bland, but the croissant was good. I was brought the wrong soup and spilled onto my sandwich and make my croissant soggy, but it was ok.I ordered the Creamy Tomato soup with it. THAT was delicious. It was rich and tomatoey, not too creamy and croutons were fabulous. My BF had the half turkey which was delicious, but I was surprised there was mustard on it. It just didn't fit into the flavor profile with the rest of the ingredients in it. It had caramelized onions, cheese, tomato, bacon and you add mustard?? I think not. The salad was great, had blue cheese, radishes, cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions. Server was cool, attentive. I'd be back, but just for breakfast.",

    "text": "Ok...what is the fuzz about! We just left this place with a very unsatisfactory experience, from the moment we got seated. We requested a table outside and even when front tables were available we got seated in a back table next to the garbage and register table. The waitress tried her best but looks like most her attention was somewhere else, a bigger party she mentioned. We ordered the Deviled eggs for appetizers and there was no taste to it except for the piece of bacon in the middle, seemed like the eggs were refrigerated for a long time. The waitress was gone for a while and never even asked if we liked the appetizer, for diner I ordered the salmon with carrots and asparagus. When I got my plate it was covered on what tasted like pancake syrup, super sweet but the salmon was cooked perfect hence the 1 star. My husband ordered the filet with crow fish and a hollandaise sauce that was very heavy he was glad the waitress suggested to have it in a separate plate, when he took a bite of the crow fish he literally spit it out it was so fishy, we never had it before and this plate was a recommendation from the waitress so he thought that's what it's supposed to be, so he pushed it aside and just ate his stake with the Mac and cheese.  And that will be the last $60 spent at the that place we will not be returning. Oh and yes I agree with some comments the vibe is a little weird.",

Service and food is always great.  Last time I went my friends were running late and I already put us down for a table, after my name got called twice they even had me have a table in the back because my friends didn't show up yet and felt bad for me waiting so long.  Even though it's busy on Sunday mornings nobody is rushing you and they still let you take enough time to make your selections.",

When we showed up at 11 I thought we might be beating some of the crowds, but no luck there. 45 minute wait. There is always a crowd here, but that is usually the sign of delicious food!!   We were seated outside and it was a nice cooler day (in the fall this would be perfect!!) I had an omlet with a few veggies in it while my mom had the turkey and egg white omlet. The hashbrowns were so amazing. Crispy and delicious! Food is definitely worth the wait alone. Service was wonderful and he was personable and contributed even more to an already pleasant brunch. I heard many things about the red velvet waffle but just couldn't bring myself to order it. They also have a coffee bar type set up behind the actual bar so I imagine their coffee drinks are delicious as well. A great little spot for brunch if you are close by!",

As i walk into the restaurant a guy greets us by saying \"what can i do for you?\" With a blank stare, Not a hello how are you guys? Are you dining in or to go?. I had to tell him well i came here to eat. I had ordered the terrace fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. When i got my food the mac and cheese was watery with a little to no flavor, i then cut into my fried chicken and the flavor was good but when i looked at the mashed potatoes under the chicken i was grossed out. My mashed potatoes was covered in what looked like grease or tons of butter which made it taste strange and salty. Overall the meal was disappointing and gross and for the price of the meal i was upset. Not to mention the time i was there i had to hear the servers non stop talking loudly at the bar while i was trying to eat my food. Very disappointing and will not come back.",

    "text": "Dear Terrace Cafe, thank you for making breakfast/brunch a meal much to be envied when not enjoying it every day of my life. I'm a happy customer. Each time I've made it into Terrace for breakfast or lunch, I've been pleased both with the ambiance, service, meal and price. Very hot spot for most weekend brunchers/breakfasters.   This location can get a bit hairy with parking. Once again, Ballantyne Village has a great parking deck with easy access for all businesses. If the front or lot spaces are all taken, the lot isn't a bad secondary. Also, you'll most likely be waiting for a good bit on the weekends. Take a seat on the sunny benches outside or take a short jaunt around the shopping center. There are plenty of great places to relax while you wait for a table to open up.   The food is fantastic. Fresh and prepared with care, love, flavor and a hefty amount of tasteful plating.   Breakfast is great. Eggs are fluffy and fresh (scrambled of course), the waffles are magnificent. I'd recommend the red velvet variety. Coffee is piping hot and refills are free. Doesn't get much better for a morning meal.   Lunch is also much to be looked forward to. I've had one of the best buffalo chicken sandwiches from Terrace. The breading is light and the sauce is balanced between spice, sweet and sour. Bread and veggies are not overwhelming and swallow the whole sandwich. Also, their glasses are such a funky and fun shape. Curved and taper up to the rim. Every kid I've seen in terrace loves them! (So do I....but I'm a kid in an adult's body, you see.)  Grab some of their wonderful chocolate covered mints on the way out. They may frown upon you grabbing a handful, but its hard to resist.   Love Terrace and visit frequently! Thanks for the solid breakfast and lunch options! Cheers!",

Chocolate Chip Pancakes are VERY Good, very close to 4 stars,  finishing touch, Powdered Sugar is sprinkled on top... Butter included, though none needed... Never seen this version, instead of Dropping the Chips into the Pancake right after pouring the Batter on the Grille (how I make mine) they put some chocolate chips on the Pancakes after they came off the grill... Did they forget or is this Terrace Cafe protocol for Chocolate Chip Pancakes???  Still very Good Flavor!  Red Velvet Waffle with Cream Cheese \"Drizzle\" ... Light and Fluffy the way my Girlfriend (Wife) LOVES them!!!  She enjoyed this very much... I thought the flavor was that of a regular Waffle and Red Color... It was not what I ordered and has no effect on the yelp star rating on MY review!  Chicken and Apple Sausage (not house made) was grilled very nicely and had good flavor  Their House Made Sausage I do NOT like the flavor  Hash Browns... Not my style! still almost three stars on this dish... I LOVE Cubed and Fried version, this one is shredded and browned on each side...DULL and seems undercooked in the middle or maybe needs to be Cooked longer!!!  More Browned to be Crunchier...  Grits were AWFUL... Our Waitress Warned me I would not like them and I already knew the Hash Browns are not the Style I like or I ordered them anyway and I'm mainly writing this part because I appreciate her telling me upfront that I would NOT like them!  Honest Staff are a HUGE Asset if the Owner is listening :   Note to the Owner : You could do MUCH Better in the areas of : Sausage, Hash Browns and especially GRITS!!!  Nice Looking Place the Service is Excellent much like the South Park version...  GREAT Play list... First you can only hear the Music if you are really paying attention or in the Restroom (which is GREAT) \"Rubberband Man\" was playing when I was visiting Men's Room, Great \"Spinners\" Tune and fitting!",

My order was simple: two poached eggs (hard), fresh fruit, and fried green tomatoes. Everything I ordered was just right. However, my husband's grits were fantastic (as I sad before). His avocado toast, he reports, was wonderful. Worth stopping at the Terrace - Ballantyne. Thank you.",

It was perfectly fried with a great crunch yet not dry at all. The waffles were also perfectly cooked with a slight crunch which is exactly what we enjoy. I wish I could remember our severs name as he was very friendly and attentive. He even was thoughtful enough to provide to go beverages, for no extra charge, which we thought was a nice gesture since we didn't ask for them.

I optioned for the steak and eggs with fruits and one red velvet waffle. Comon, can't come to Terrance Cafe and NOT have their famous red velvet waffle. Everything is on point. Kami who is our waitress and she's superb. Very attentive and she's good at what she does!  I truly enjoyed my steak and eggs. Steak was done medium just the way i wanted. Eggs was over easy as requested. And of course,they won't mess up the waffle! All in all, the man is impressed so this will be my brunch spot when I'm on that side of town!",

The best thing about the Terrace is probably their menu and the refreshing variety of food they serve. It's not overwhelming but they have unique breakfast and lunch dishes that make The Terrace stand out. Even common items like the Fish and Chips have a unique twist to it (which is one giant super-crispy fish filet instead of 3 smaller. Although due to the size, it can vary on how well it is cooked through).  I got the Open-face BBQ Pulled Pork Breakfast Biscuit with jalapeno relish and tomato jam (I think), and it was very good and actually much more refreshing than I anticipated, but perfect for a brunch. Their bloody Mary's are also pretty good and spicy.  The staff is usually nice although sometimes forgetful, where someone in my party got a french press coffee and they forgot to add the coffee, and they forgot to add the mayonnaise and onion to my angus burger.   Overall, I enjoyed the Terrace and would recommend it.",

When we inquired with the waitress to better understand what the differences were between the various types, she flat out told us she didn't know.  There was no \"let me check\" or \"I'll follow up\" just flat out \"I don't know, the bartender makes them\". Well obviously.  We then stopped a manager and explained the situation to him, and he supported her in saying the same thing.  I'm not sure how you have several items on the menu and your employees are not abreast of the items.  Furthermore, the lack of interest to find out was appalling.  It's fine.  I'll purchase my mimosas and brunch elsewhere in the future.",

There were a little bit busy so we had to wait something like 5 minutes. They had muffins and flavored water for the people waiting for a table. The muffins were delicious, but the water was so bitter I barely could take it. It had lemons, oranges, cucumber and apples I believe. Our table became available and our waitress came right away. We placed our drink orders and she explained about the specials for the day. I had toast sticks with strawberry sauce and pastry cream. I wasn't expecting a huge plate but when I got it I was really surprised. My plate was ginormous and delicious! I could only eat one and a half and my husband ate the rest. Which was kind of good because my husband ordered biscuit and sausage gravy and we were so disappointed when it came. The place was one biscuit split in half with gravy on top and they charged us $12.50 for that, so please be aware. Other than that the experience was good. No crazy wait, our waitress was awesome, the food was good and did not take long to get ready. I also like that they have outside sitting with plenty of space. We will probably come to this location more often instead to the one at South Park.",

I had heard a lot of good things about it and my wife had looked over the menu and it had her seal of approval.  Drove down from Cornelius and got there just before noon. Seated immediately and our server was there shortly and presented us with menu's and took our beverage orders.  Back in couple of minutes with our tea's. My wife ordered the Crab Cake Appetizer along with a side of fruit.  I ordered the Nashville Fried Chicken which also had Cheesy Potatoes and Sauted Mixed Vegetables.  Took a good while for these items to come out particularly in light of the fact that my wife asked for her appetizer to be served at the same time as my entree.  Lunch showed up and it was excellent.  My wife as requested that the hold the Garlic Aioli  which they did but at the same time did not bring the Campaign Vinaigrette.On request, it was promptly presented.  My wife enjoyed her Crab Cakes very much and the fruit side was very good and for a change, more than just melon.  The Nashville Fried Chicken was excellent. Nice and spicy with the proper amount of heat.  The Cheesy Potatoes did not have much taste of Cheese however although the Mixed Vegetables were nice and tender.  First time here. Nice Atmosphere, good service and very good food.  We will be back although probably not for Sunday Brunch till after Football Season. My wife insist on being home by 1:00 pm on Sundays and I've learned not to drive to far on game day.",

    "text": "This restaurant virtually ruined my company's anniversary celebration this year in May 2019. It was not the first time. Our first luncheon in July 2017 was highly successful. The food was great (the creme brulees blow-torched by hand was simply divine). After chef Justin K. left in 2017, things went downhill. I had used Terrace to cater sides at our holiday luncheon later in 2017 and the red potatoes were under cooked. It took several calls to get that rectified and subsequently credited to our account in 2018. I won't even talk about trying to remedy a separate situation where my card got charged for another department's luncheon. It was too confusing to resolve both the undone potatoes and the incorrect charge at the same time. After that, I decided to explore other catering alternatives although this place is very close to our company's location (pretty much around the corner).  Let me say first: the food can be good. Our company uses Terrace for lunches, dinners, holiday dinner parties as well as catering. After my  recent experience, I will no longer use them for catering. I will not patronize this place again as an individual nor will I encourage my colleagues to do so. This place will continue to do well without my patronage based on it's location, but beware if you have an important event that requires catering because you may wind up short the day of. For my event in May 2019, I called within a week of the luncheon and placed my order with Tamara. Everything went smoothly for the most part and things were confirmed for dining to begin at noon. Due to concerns with Terrace in the past, we did order from another restaurant to expand our menu options. That caterer arrived at 11:10 am and was completely set up by 11:40, all the while considering that Terrace was coming and offered to help them with their set up in accordance with theirs.   Employees started to gather well before noon. Mind you, serving was to begin at noon. By this time, I had received no call or e-mail from Terrace about the delay. Figuring the restaurant would be open and busy at noon for the lunch crowd, I called both the main number and the cell number for Tamara around 11:50 am. There was no answer at the restaurant at first and then I received an answering machine on the second call. I received the voice mail for Tamara's cell and she immediately called back. She was notified by the kitchen at 11:30 am that our food was not delivered. Tamara had to drop whatever she was doing to deliver our food using her own vehicle. She apologized and was in transit, asking if we had a cart to help bring the food up. Needless to say, this was unacceptable. My employees not only had to get the food, but there were no racks or sternos available. Luckily, we had some of our own from past catering events. Not only was the food extremely late but my staff had to help with the majority of set up. As a result, our luncheon started much later than it should have.  To date, I received no formal apology from the owner, no discount from my bill, no follow up call - absolutely nothing from Terrace. I will NEVER use this place again for any of my company's needs! I will post my review on every possible social media outlet so that people are aware of their poor quality of service.",

    "text": "Terrace is one of my favorite brunch spots in Charlotte. They are ALWAYS busy, but parties of two are generally seated within 20 minutes at peak brunch time on the weekends.  The actual location/decor is nothing of note. The Ballantyne location is in a shopping mall filled with families; lots of action going on. I've never eaten inside. The interior isn't particularly nice and it's relatively loud. The patio is also busy but feels calmer.  Their waitstaff is extraordinarily friendly. They've forgotten a few things in the 4 times I've dined here, but they are always apologetic and come around frequently to refresh water and whatnot.  Now the food: there is a fabulously wide selection for brunch. They have many traditional dishes as well as inventive ones. Their lemon poppyseed French toast is simply divine. Their egg dishes have been mixed but overall good. Any sweet food you order is going to be delicious. I had coffee cake straight out of the over - UNreal.   As a vegetarian, I am THRILLED that they have \"fake chicken\" AKA seitan on the menu. Their vegan chicken & waffles is fabulous. I recently ordered a skillet that had sausage in it that was happily swapped for the seitan. That means a lot to me, especially in Charlotte.  My only complaint is the price. It's REALLY hard to justify a standard-size, standard-ingredient skillet being $16. 16!! It was a special, but as I said, none of the ingredients were particularly rare or unique. But, I like the food, so I pay for it. But be aware before going that this is not a cheap brunch venue.",

    "text": "I am giving it 1 star because I can't give less than that. This is my first review ever and I am making this effort because I am super disappointed. Here are my reasons.  1. As soon as we entered, the person at the reception was very rude and when asked for a table, she didnt even let me finish my sentence  and responded very rudely.  2. Once we went to our table, the person who attended our table was also rude. Every dish that we ordered had something missing and when I called her, she would hear one thing and just leave without acknowledging. I had to call her again for a different dish Everytime.  3. Every order we had was wrong. I had to get the toast replaced thrice and it was still not good. The first time it was burnt for two of our orders. Then second time they just gave bread pieces without toasting. I then called the manager and showed her both toasts and she went to get it replaced. They came back after our breakfast was done and even then it was done only on one side!!!!  See the pics.  4. They also forgot the order of our coffee. When it arrived, the coffee was cold and there was no spoon or stirrer with it.   5. Avacado Toast was not really Avacado Toast. (But that might just be my opinion)  6. French toast had no syrup with it.  7. After replacing the toast 3 times and still not getting it right, I just gave up but the manager nor the staff even apologized once.   8. On our way back we saw few more people complaining about their orders.   I would not recommend this place.",

Me and my family have been coming to Terrace Cafe for years now, back when they use to server crafted coffees like Burnt Banana Latte and the food servings were full sizes and quality was outstanding.  Sounds like a distant time based on the service and quality we saw today. We sit down and order our kids food immediately and drinks to try and get the kids eat. After 25 minutes we had to complain to a manager to finally get our drinks, after 45 minutes we finally received our kids meals.   We have officially hit the point that we will no longer come back to Terrace Cafe!",

Chicken and Waffles; Breakfast Casserole; and the Banana nut french toast.. these are the things I have tried here. I have yet to venture outside of the breakfast/brunch bubble but you can better believe I will try dinner sometime soon.  The waitstaff is decent and the ambience/decor is also perfectly fine... my mom and I have been here twice and we both find all the curved glasses and silverware strange but they aren't bad.  I come here because the food is so good!! I've only had one thing here I didn't like and that was a side item. It was the hashbrowns, however my mom likes them so it's probably just me. Their grits are also really good in my opinion and I'm picky about those.    The chicken is well cooked (not overdone), the breakfast casserole was flavorful, and the banana nut french toast was absolutely sinful!! Oh I've also had a blueberry muffin here and that tasted store bought (so two things I wasn't impressed with). Everything else fully makes up for two random items though, as they are just marvelous!! Next time I'm going to hope for a fabulous quiche of the day!!   I love that this place is so close to my house, and I will definitely be back soon!!",

We've had appetizers many times at the bar (mainly before a movie), but last weekend we made it in time to have dinner before the movie. The appetizers always amaze...particularly fried green tomatoes and the hummus (served with toasted sesame seed pita, sooo delish).   The table tried the pork tenderloin, scallops and shrimp & grits - everyone was impressed and cleaned their plates! My dinner was the Brick Chicken with herb risotto. Can I just tell you, this is the best chicken I have ever tasted in my life. Seriously, am I raving about chicken? It was that good. I even saved the leftovers and they were still delicious! And I rarely get chicken at a restaurant since I eat it all the time - but the brick cooking intrigued me. I'm so glad I tried it!  Every time we've been, we get excellent service. Last visit was no exception, our waitress visited us right away and our food came out quickly.   I don't know how popular Terrace Cafe is for dinner, I think most people rave about their breakfast. But that kitchen really churns out some great food after dark too! Check it out!",

They had complimentary lemon mini poppy seed muffins available for those waiting - nice touch. I had an egg white, veggie omelet and stone ground grits. Both were super tasty. I will go back. I did not like paying $1 more for egg whites and then another $1 to add one extra veggie (the menu only allows for three) I wanted four. It seems like I am being penalized for making a healthier choice. Either way, I give this establishment top billing. Friendly staff, clean facility, great food and comfortable spaces.",

I opted for the red velvet waffle--this has been advertised so much as a delectable menu item, so I gave it a try.  The batter was light and fluffy, which made for a light and fluffy waffle.  It wasn't overcooked and hard like most waffles. The cream cheese icing on top was set enough that you didn't need to add any more syrup.    If you're going on a Sunday, be prepared to wait about 30 minutes at least.  There always seems to be a line here.  The service was good; no complaints there.  If I had to make a gripe it would be to add more vegetarian, savory options to the menu, besides just eggs.  An investment in non-meat sausage or something like that would be ideal.  If you're an omnivore, you'll likely like this place a lot.",

The salmon was so tasty and absolutely amazing, cooked to perfection (medium rare), this one was my favorite! I thought the portion would be a bit bigger, but even if I knew the portion size beforehand, I would of got it anyway! The red velvet waffle wasn't too sweet which is exactly what I wanted. The chicken was crunchy. Everything we ordered was tasty!  The waiter was friendly and the service was good, I'd give it a 8/10. I didn't expect the service to be amazing since it was so crowded. Overall, I'm impressed and I'll definitely be back!",

Since it was our son's birthday, we were excited to get some food in him and then enjoy his birthday. But nearly an hour later we had no food and not once did our server come to check on us until we asked for him.    We saw at least 5 families that were seated after us, get their food and leave. We requested to see the manager and our sever told us she is too busy and tied up for her to come and speak with us. When she finally did talk to us she said she had 4 people quit on her, and she was about to bust into tears.   So instead of telling us our food would be up next, she made excuses, she told us there was nothing she could do to make it better, and it would be another 20 minutes before she could get our food. No mention of giving us a gift card or comping our meal. We left hungry, frustrated and angry, and wasted two precious hours of our sons birthday. We will not come back to this restaurant again, even though we have been patrons for many years.",

We arrived and waited about 30 minutes to be seated.  We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited.    The red velvet waffles are a must order, one of our friends got those.  I was looking for something more healthy and I got the grilled chicken Cobb salad.  A few other favorites were the soup and sandwich.    My salad was yummy!  I really enjoyed it.  Our service was pretty good, but it was hard for it to be top of the line because the restaurant was so crowded.  We will be back and use yelp waitlist next time!",

The only downfall was we were sitting there going on 10 mins with no waiter coming up to us or introducing themselves or asking for our drinks. We had to end up asking our hostess where our waiter was? She end up grabbing someone. Once someone was finally assigned to our table I have no complaints about the service after that.   The menu was pretty broad with lots of options. I ended up getting the daily special which was praline french toast that was $12. The sides we kinda pricey and not included in my meal $3-$5 a piece and I got bacon.   The food was out in about 10 mins. My french toast was amazing though one of the best french toasts I have had. I honestly was dancing with every bite. My bacon was cooked nicely as well.   I also had a mimosa which was about $9. Next time I probably wouldn't get a drink because my total was pretty expensive nearly $30 for one person getting a drink.   I would recommend and I would go back.",

We called about 15 mins prior and mentioned we were on our way and what the wait time would be. The guy on the phone said no more than 10 minutes - perfect. WRONG. We got there in 15 mins like we told the guy on the phone and apparently 3 other parties of 6 had entered 5 mins before us and were seated so now there were no more tables. The host told us it would be about 25 minutes even though I saw a couple of empty tables that could have easily been pushed together to make room for us.   Anyways, 25 mins later, we had to go check to make sure we were still in queue and we waited another 20 mins. All in all, we waited close to an hour. When we walked inside, at least 90% of the tables were empty so why the hell did we wait this long?! Once we sat down, we ordered waters WITH lemon for the table. Our waters were brought out but no lemons. Then, we had to remind our waiter to bring lemons. After that, we put in our orders and got our food probably another 30 mins later. I was raging with anger internally and didn't enjoy my meal at all. The vegan chicken didn't even taste like tofu. The \"spinach artichoke dip\" is not actually what you would think it looks like. I can guarantee 1000% that I make a better dip.   I will not be back and I don't recommend.",

My wife ordered the surf and turf. A big hunk of meat on top of vegetables and then topped with a layover of pimento cheese and then a few fried oysters. The oysters were almost entirely batter and tasted nothing of oysters. The steak - once we got a steak knife because the kitchen had to wash one - was still almost unsliceable. It was at least cooked to order.  I chose the Reuben sandwich and it was tasty if a little greasy from the melted cheese and the slaw on top. I ended up eating most of it with knife and fork. Better with the corn risotto than fries, for sure.  Perhaps we'll return to Terrace, but if we do it will be without a steak.  [Review 9964 overall, 1544 of 2018.]",

Got there early bc brunch on a Sunday gets busy really fast. It was my first time here. I had the Full Breakfast. I did scrambled eggs with sausage (which were huge), I got fresh fruit instead of grits/hash, and then I substituted the 2 pancakes for a Belgian waffle. Very well accommodating. In my experience I've always had issues with pancake/waffle substitutions so this place definitely set the bar with me. I was going to order the mocha latte but quickly changed my mind for the grapefruit juice. But the latte looked warm and right for the Carolina cold. Per my guest, the creme brulee latte was excellent. She also got the chicken and waffle breakfast with fresh fruit as well.   Great cafe!",

They have water and mini blue berry muffins for you while you wait.     Place is super clean and the staff was friendly from the hostess to our waiter Mark.  Food arrived quickly and was hot.  The secret to eggs Benedict is not to over cook the eggs and the cook got it SO RIGHT.  Hollandaise sauce had a hint of spice so no need to add Tabasco.  Hubby had pancakes and a side of sausage which I snuck a bite of each and both were tasty.  While we didn't have Mimosas they were flowing freely around us.   We would eat here every weekend - nice selection for breakfast but alas we are from Oregon and just here for the weekend!  Thanks for a great start to our weekend!",

They have mini muffins and water for you to enjoy while you wait, which I thought was a nice touch. There isn't much standing room while you wait so we had to keep stepping aside so others could get to the muffins. I'm sure this is less of an issue in warmer months when you can wait outside.   Our food came out in a reasonable time and everything was hot and prepared as ordered. My husband had eaten at another Terrace Cafe so he knew he wanted a red velvet waffle. I tasted it and was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting more of a chocolate flavor but it was sweet and not like a red velvet cupcake.   I will be keeping this on my list of brunch spots to frequent during my visits to Charlotte.",

Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but not out of this world good. If you order the waffles make sure you taste it without syrup first, because the cream cheese frosting is already sweet. Save your calories for the shrimp & grits and ask for their homemade hot sauce for an extra kick.   Scott was our server for brunch and he was friendly, attentive, and quick. Great experience overall and with a variety of food on the menu, this is a great spot for brunch with a large or small group.",

It had 3 shrimp, 2 scallops, a couple of lobster pieces with weak broth and some pasta (hardly a real bouillabaisse). It was very obvious to us that they have no chefs involved with preparing and serving dishes, but they charge prices as if they do.

    "text": "This was a weird dining experience.  The atmosphere is like a casual dining spot but the prices we high for the offerings. My wife and I spent almost $80 on 1 small app, 1 dessert and 2 entrees. No drinks.  Both entrees were wrong as if they ran out of food and were plating dishes on the fly with whatever they had. Nothing we ordered came out correct except the water.   App:  Deviled eggs - good flavor in the filling but the whites were extremely rubbery.   Entree 1 : Sea bass topped with crab / veg medley.  The Sea bass was good except it didn't come with anything that it was advertised on the menu. It came with fried mashed potatoes instead of the veggies , no crab meat, and had pesto sauce on it. I actually asked for the menu and pointed to what I thought I was getting. They brought my plate back and there was literally about 1/4 of an oz of crab meat. My wife and I just chuckled.   Entree 2 : salmon and cheesy mashed. Salmon was great, but came with veggies instead of mashed.  Come to find out they ran out of mashed potatoes and we were stuck wth the veggies.  Who runs out of a main side dish at 6:30p?!   Dessert: PB brownie cheesecake. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND CALORIES! Huge piece but bland and tasted kinda stale. Was also supposed to be topped with Pb cups. It wasn't. By this time we were fed up and just asked for the check.   We have NEVER not finished a dessert. We took it home and even the kids thought it was bad.   Service: average at best. Everyone had super awkward personalities and it was painful to have a conversation. Our waitress seemed to be frustrated with everything. She would ask us how we are doing and then walk away while we were answering. We waited for silverware on 2 different occasions.     To top it off the UPS driver wheels in 10 giant boxes right beside our table to unload in the kitchen.    Like I said, it was a strange experience.",

After that I decided to get the chicken and waffles. They are amazing! I'm not a chicken and waffle connoisseur, but I do appreciate boneless crispy fried chicken and a good waffle. Together, they are awesome. You also get a choice of fruit, hashbrowns, or grits. I always get the hashbrowns, and then never eat them, you really don't need them.   On Sundays they offer a $5 mimosa, and bloody marry special after 12. The mimosas are very good, not too much juice and a good choice of champagne.   The wait staff is always really nice and the hostesses try their best to get you seated as quickly as possible.   They do not take reservations for breakfast, only for dinner (but really truly go for breakfast) so there is most of the time a wait before noon (between 15-30 minutes depending on the size of your group).   Great spot for brunch, I try to get everyone there at least once!",

    "text": "The lemon poppyseed French toast, one of the daily specials, was amazing - even if there was no resemblance to French toast. It was three thick slabs of very good lemon poppyseed bread that had been grilled and slightly crisped on the edges and then drizzled with a lemon sweet sauce and berries on the side. Get this... It's great. But overpoweringly sweet and carb-y, so I also got eggs and toast and a side of fried green tomatoes.   The fried green tomatoes were perfectly done, with a crispy nice exterior and a firm tart green tomato interior.  The aoli sauce that comes on the side is necessary but also really good.   I asked for eggs to be over easy, stressing that I needed the white to be completely cooked and I preferred the yellow to be runny. Unfortunately the white, while cooked on the outside edge, was still very much raw. Sourdough toast is great and served with a side of strawberry preserves that were also not too sweet but perfect.   The generic breakfast platter comes with eggs meat potatoes and toast/pancakes. This platter was all very average and nothing that couldn't easily be accomplished at home for far less money.   If I come here again, I will stick with one of the sweet specialties like the poppyseed French bread and simply order a side of eggs ($2.5) or fried green tomatoes ($3).",

We go out to eat at least twice a week, and at least one place a week is usually from a list of our favorites.  We came to Terrace Cafe on Valentine's Day, and the experience was so awesome we had to come back the following weekend. I won't ruin it too much for anyone, but EVERYTHING on the menu seems to be a great choice! We bought a 3rd person the last time and ordered A LOT to make sure  The chef even came out to talk to us on Valentine's Day but I'm sure on other nights that's rare because they were jam packed the following weekend. When you go, ask for Terry! Best waitress I've ever met & you'll have laughs for days!",

    "text": "This is by far our favorite breakfast joint in Charlotte. My wife ordered the eggs Benedict Florentine and I got the biscuits and gravy. Both were amazing! The good was incredibly fresh and everything was homemade. Even the plating was top-notch.   The food was so good we both had to share! It was (by far) the best biscuits and gravy dish I've ever had in my life and the eggs Benedict dish was to die for.   Service was friendly and the wait time for seating was manageable.  Also, the prices were very reasonable (amazing actually for this caliber of food).  The biscuits and gravy dish was $9 and eggs Benedict/Florentine was $11.50 - when you consider this is what you'd pay at IHOP for inferior food, I'd say this place is a steal.   Recommending this place to all friends and family. Go there - you won't regret it!",

We both ordered the scallop entree ($23/each), which had several scallops in lobster risotto - and it came with a salad of bibb lettuce with an orange vinaigrette dressing.  *Really* delicious!  We couldn't resist ordering dessert, and I had the peanut butter cheesecake & my husband had the cookie cake ($6.50/each).  His was good, but mine was incredibly delicious and the portion was *huge*.  Since the weather was pleasant (meaning, not too warm), we chose to eat outside and it was really delightful (they have a generous amount of outdoor seating, btw).  Also, our server was very pleasant and attentive.",

When you order side items they should be served at the the same time as the entree. What ever comes with the sides or entree should be brought out in advance of the order. These folks don't get any of the basics. They have really good food and they blow it by bringing it out lukewarm and piece meal. This causes a flair up in the family and results in a ruined overall good time. The staff tried to make it right but after the family outing is ruined what is the point in a 50% discount. Keep your discount just learn the basics.",

This was my first time here and wow the specialty items make this place worth going.  I had the banana pecan french toast which was amazing.  The fresh ingredients and flavor made this worth the fat grams I ate!  My girlfriend had the Carrot cake waffles which also were amazing I was so stuffed after eating here.  It is very rich food my suggestion to all is if you want specialty items go here like the waffles and french toast.  If you just want eggs ham ect go elsewhere only because it is a little pricey compared to most places.",

Bonus, it comes with a side option. The Red Velvet Waffle did not disappoint, the cream cheese icing on top was perfect; sweet, but not so sweet that I feared a sugar coma.  I got the hash browns as a side and they were good. They did come on a tiny little plate so it was very difficult to eat them without making a mess.  I can see where parking could be an issue during busier times, but we had our choice of 3 front row spots when we came here.  A little more expensive than other breakfast spots that we frequent, but that Red Velvet Waffle is SO worth it.",

The server made very good wine and food recommendations. Our salads and entrees were very tasty--well seasoned wth a minimal wait. The portions were generous, and both myself and my fellow diner took home leftovers. The only drawback to my experience was that we had to ask our server for mini rolls after observing that the tables to both sides of us had received them. We also had to flag down our server for a wine refill. I definitely recommend Terrace Cafe for a nice dinner in Ballantyne.",

    "text": "I originally fell in love with Terrace Cafe after going to the Southpark location on my lunch hour. So naturally, when I moved to the Ballantyne area I was thrilled that I'd still be within walking distance on the weekends as well! The food is amazing, they serve breakfast through lunch and have come up with some pretty creative breakfast items (my favorite, the berry split, just trust me!). They also serve some healthier items for both breakfast and lunch which are marked on the menu, making it very easy to go here if you are trying to watch what you eat. But don't fear, you really don't lose any flavor with those choices! Despite how great their food is, and the nice ambiance, I couldn't give it a five out of five stars for one pretty big reason. I would not suggest going here outside of peak lunch hours (and brunch hours on the weekends). It seems like they staff the lunch hour with the best of the best servers, but once that small time-frame is over, they bring in some pretty terrible, lazy servers to fill in. Not sure why that is, but it has certainly ruined some late-lunches for me and from what I've heard, some of my friends. Such a shame, but at least you can be confident you'll have a great experience and great food during lunch!",

My mother ordered it based on her last experience with the dish, which was delicious.  They changed it to a spongy square dish compacting all of the ingredients into this spongy square, including the has browns.  It wasn't good.  I should have had them take it back.  Big disappointment.  I'm unsure why these restaurants change popular dishes that people obviously order as a favorite.  Sometimes I think restaurants do what's easy for them with no concern for their patrons.  Ya'll need to revert to the prior receipe.  Also you must do a better job during Sunday brunch.  You know it's going to be busy.  I'll never come back on a Sunday.  I didn't mind when I visited that the wait was over 30 minutes, but when we sat down the waitress, when I asked what was taking so long, said on Sunday expect it to take at least 25 to 30 minutes to get your meal.

Service slow and very spotty - arrived around 3:30 on a Sat afternoon - only handful of people there but took a long time for drinks to arrive.  Were also handed a mini-menu and were told because of \"Restaurant Week\" their menu between lunch and dinner was reduced to only a handful of items normally on menu.  While I heartily approve of Restaurant Week I do not understand the reasoning behind downsizing your regular menu - so we were forced to choose between a few \"bite size\" items.  Mussels were in an unappetizing broth.  Chicken pot pie was tastless.  Chicken drummettes were fatty and overpowered by a gooey unappetizing sauce.  I hope this was just a one time bad experience.  But they need to go back to allowing patrons to order from regular menu regardless of what special events are taking place.",

The seating capacity of this restaurant is very limited during inclement weather, so when they get busy under these conditions, expect a 15-25 minute wait.  Sorry, no reservations are taken for breakfast-brunch.  Had the lamb frittata and my companion the eggs benedict. The frittata is served with a copious amount of lamb and goat cheese, which blew the egg portion of the frittata away.  The lamb was well cooked, but was rather blandly seasoned.  The lamb was cut into many rather thick \"chunks\", rather than thinly sliced which would have been more appropriate. The benedict was above average, but not exceptional.  The eggs and canadian bacon were well prepared, but a rather drab hollandaise sauce held the dish back.  They prepare fresh jam for bread sides which was very good. The service was also very good.  Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant if one is in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.",

    "text": "I wanted to give this place 4 stars but on 2 occasions we have had ho-hum experiences. But overall, the place is great, we typically go for Sunday brunch. Ask your server or bartender for the spicy bloody mary, sometimes it is on a specials menu, but they will always make it for you if you ask, it is with absolute peppar instead of plain absolut. Yummo! On this most recent visit, just last Sunday, it was a gorgeous warming sunny day after 2 very cold, windy and wet days and when we arrived, we noticed they weren't serving outside on their patio. And there was an hour wait. We were flabbergasted they weren't using the patio and asked the hostess why...she said, \"oh, well, we kinda didn't think it would be as nice as it is, so we didn't set it up\". Wow, we thought...you all don't check the weather? And better yet, why not change at the last moment, when it got to 65 degrees and the sun was shining, get someone out there to set it up! Since the wait was so long we got our bloody mary's from the bar and were actually allowed to sit outside at a bare table and bask in the sunshine before our timer buzzed and we were seated...indoors. Very weird. That said, I usually order the benedict over filet and or the first time, my eggs were not overcooked, they were delightfully runny and perfect (this would be the other ho-hum experience we had when we first started going there, my eggs would almost be hard boiled not poached-on one occasion I actually sent it back and they cut 25% off the check) ! My filets were cooked to perfection as well this round. My teenage daughter had the benedict florentine and loved it as well, but her favorite is usually the red velvet waffle. My fiance had an omelet. All was excellent and the service was good too, and always is on each visit. Terrace Cafe is a great stop for brunch, I highly recommend it!",

The only negative is the parking which they have no control over so be prepared to park in the parking deck down the block. No hold barred the best chicken and waffles that I have ever had, and if you really want to go off the hook try the red velvet waffles.  If you want tasty try the chicken lolly pops and the biscuits with the pepper jam.  Just plan to get there early or have reservations.  One of my favorite places.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were very interested in dining here for breakfast as it's close to the house, the menu looked good, and we wanted to try something different from Another Broken Egg Cafe.   We attempted to dine in on father's day. We waited about 5 minutes before finding a spot at the bar and everything was fine. Ordered with no problem. Water refills never happened. But that's something I can look over as I understand it's a restaurant holiday.   What I can't accept is what happened when we got our food. I ordered the Turkey Omelette.  The food runner presented me with the Veggie Omelette.  My boyfriend quickly pointed out to me that it was wrong. Ok things happen. I advised him that I ordered something different. He quickly apologized. I watched him talk to the server, who told him no that it was the Turkey Omelette.  I took his word for it (the servers should know this food better than me...right??) but as I cut into the omelette there was no meat let alone turkey... I even had my boyfriend check it.    I'm not one to complain. I would have loved to have just had it recooked properly.  I pushed my plate to the side. And waited for ten minutes....no one checked on us but I made eye contact with EVERY barista/server/bartender in the area (at least 3 people returned the eye contact, even the bartender who was taking care of us). As a server in the industry this is UNACCEPTABLE. No one seemed to care or find it odd that my boyfriend was halfway through his meal and I wasn't eating.  I was done. There's nothing worse than a server who doesn't care and I'd lost my appetite. I finally interrupted my bartender who was too busy to check back on us but kept working in front of us, ignoring my plate.   Of course the manager took care of everything, which I appreciate. My boyfriend didn't finish his food and we just left. It's just utterly disappointing because it could have been easily resolved when I told the food runner it was wrong.....and maybe if someone would have done a 2 minute check back to make sure everything was fine (an industry standard) we would have stayed.   Not interested in going back. I can find good food anywhere. Lack of service was a turn off even for a holiday.",

    "text": "Two words to preface this review: pleasantly surprised.  I have visited the other Terrace Cafe in Piedmont Town Center, and have disliked it all 3 times I've been there. I decided to give Terrace another shot--and this one is in a better location for me anyway. We sat outside on a warm summer afternoon. Pleasant! The waiter was quite mellow, but we felt he was thoughtful and overall a nice gentleman. He recommended the chicken salad croissant for me. The chicken salad is made with cream cheese and sour cream (I think it was sour cream) instead of mayo, giving it a totally different flavor. It comes with grapes and pineapples, and it was just awesome. The croissant was light, and a nice background to the chicken salad. Yum! It came with fries that were a little too salty for my taste, but were good. The only thing I didn't touch on that plate were the dastardly tomatoes. I don't like tomatoes, and they didn't look good, so they got to sit and bask in the sun. Haha tomatoes. Mom ordered the salmon and said it was spectacular, and my sister ordered an average french toast.  As I said, service was very good, nothing to complain about here. He nailed the recommendation on the chicken salad. Next time I have to try the red velvet waffle...sounds delicious! A rare 5 star review for Terrace!",

    "text": "Wanted to share a really poor customer service experience.  Thinking I had reservations for 6 booked solid for Mother's Day having booked Terrace Cafe through Open Table weeks before, I received a random email indicating the restaurant had cancelled our reservation - no explanation, no call.  Thinking perhaps it was a mistake, I called.  Someone named Michael answered and said they do not take reservations and it had been a glitch on open table to accept reservations...well okay, but that means they have cancelled all reservations (they were booked full) that were made and didn't even have the courtesy to call their diners to let them know personally, just hoping they got and checked a random email...for mother's day!  So now a week out,  we're left scrambling for mother's day plans.  When asked to speak to the manager, Michael said \"sure\" and placed me on hold...I'm still on hold 20 minutes later - clearly he made no attempt to get a manager and just wanted me to \"go away\".  Read the reviews on open table - clearly, it seems they have had a management change and with that, their service has gone downhill, this instance a prime example.",

    "text": "I have to give this place five stars based on our first two visits.  My mom and aunt were in town visiting my 2 year old daughter (I know the score, they weren't here to see me!) and we went there for lunch on Friday.  My mom wanted breakfast but also lunch, so we agreed to return on Saturday morning for breakfast.  First off, we got there before the lunch rush and didn't have to wait... so that addresses some of the negative reviews I've read here.   It did get packed just minutes after we sat down.   Our server was wonderful, so that addresses another negative I read (ask for Libby's section).  Our food was FANTASTIC.  We ordered adult grilled cheese (the review was 'best grilled cheese I've ever had'), tempura chicken fingers and corned beef sandwich.  The tempura fingers were really good... but then again I love tempura.  I had the leftover of the corned beef sandwich today, and it was really good.   Not Rascal House in Miami Beach, good.. but good!  My wife said the onion rings she got with her grilled cheese were awesome.  For breakfast today we again did not have to wait... but it did get a little crowded after we sat down.  I just  had to dig in to their famous red velvet waffle, and it did not disappoint.  When it came out it appeared small to me.  I was thankful my wife ordered the lumberjack breakfast (what I called it, I think it's called \"complete breakfast\" on the menu) because I figured I'd be eating half of that.  Well, by the time I finished the red velvet waffle, I was done.  Small in stature, large in richness!  Wow, that was a powerful breakfast.  Also ordered were the Belgian waffle with fruit, and the banana nut french toast, which my mom raved over.  We had the same server on Saturday that we had on Friday and she again was great!  All in all, we had two phenomenal meals at Terrace Cafe.  I've heard from friends that dinner there is not so good.. and that does not surprise me.  Based on the speed of delivery of our meals after ordering, this place specializes in \"quick and very tasty\".",

    "text": "Delicious brunch spot. Immediately when you walk in, the atmosphere is warm, bright and modern. There's an energy without being noisy.  For a 11am on a Sunday morning, I was surprised there wasn't a longer wait. (Note: I arrived late, but my friends only waited 5 minutes for a table.) The crowd was steady, but all around us, things seemed to move quickly.  My dish was excellent. It was so hard to decide! Terrace Cafe has a lot of unique dishes - like a Red Velvet Waffle and S'mores French Toast. I ended up with a special - Bananas Foster Waffle. Woah! Almost more like a dessert than a meal - it was so good. Waffle was baked perfectly. The bananas foster was sweet, with enough sauce that I didn't need syrup. It also came with eggs - I chose scrambled. Not too runny, not too dry. I was most impressed by the fruit. It was not your typical lame brunch - with some sad-looking melons. Oh no, not at Terrace Cafe. I got a few pieces of melon, but mostly strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, kiwi and mango. Mango! If fruit is an option for a side, I highly recommend it.  A few other nice touches - my hot tea came in an individual pot of hot water. Our waitress brought a box full of teas from which to choose. The dishware is very chic: curved water glasses, rectangular white plates, interestingly curved silverware.  My one complaint was our waitress. She seemed a bit detached and wasn't very attentive to our table, though we noticed she paid more attention to others around us. She did not check on us after our meal arrived. However, two managers stopped by our table to make sure everything was ok and they were very friendly.   Overall, a fantastic restaurant. I will be back for brunch -- and to try lunch or dinner as well!",

Pretty good although the hash browns were just roasted potatoes. Tasted good regardless, as did everything else.  Second time I decided to be a little adventurous/-had the shrimp and grits and a side of the fried chicken (breast, not leg, thigh or wing, unfortunately). All delicious although they might not have known since I left a decent amount left on my plate but that's only because their portions are so huge!

I had an appointment so I couldn't wait, but i was determined to make it back after; which is what I did. It was way less busy around 3:00 pm than at noon when I originally went in. I sat at one of the tables near the bar and the lovely hostesses became my waitresses! They were honest with their suggestions and so I ordered the red velvet waffle with the fried chicken breast and a cup of coffee. It came out in a timely manner which was another plus. I usually do not like icing on anything, but since I forgot to inform my waitress, I rolled with it. Good thing I did! It was delicious. It was not too sweet nor too thick. I didn't any syrup. The chicken was moist, not overly cooked or dry. I topped it with some good ol' Texas Pete and I was in a small piece of heaven. I defiantly will visit here again!",

    "text": "Oh my wow! I love this place! As pointed out to me by my cousin, they are known for their breakfast selections, so I'm VERY glad that they still served breakfast when we got there around 2:30pm for a late lunch.  My meal: red velvet waffle, hashbrowns, blueberry tea. ALL were fantastic! They don't have a very wide variety of teas from which to choose. It's the usual green, chamomile, black, earl grey, BUT the one unique choice they did have was blueberry. So of course, I had to go with that one. Yummy and sweet.  The waffle was like melt in your mouth good. I asked for whipped cream to add to the cream cheese icing already on top. Very impressed with the hashbrown presentation, too. It's not like the scattered hashbrowns you'll get at waffle house or IHOP. It's neatly shaped into a circle, giving it a nice crisp all around. Salted/seasoned just right too, so it's not bland whatsoever.  I did look through their lunch choices, but breakfast definitely sounded much more appetizing. So for sure go for breakfast food and not dinner or lunch.",

Drinks are also top notch! However, the service is sub par at best. We waited a long time after being seated for someone to take our orders and then had to ask for drink refills. Also, keeping me from giving a 4 star review are the dinner food and pricing. Dinner here is a completely different ball game, food was OK but not for the price. Service was a little better at dinner.",

    "text": "I wanted to write an update for Terrace Cafe.  We have not visited them or their other location for the scrumptious breakfast recently, but we decided to visit this location for Charlotte Restaurant week this past Friday.  They are a little more pricey than what we would spend for dinner, but since we love their breakfast we wanted to try the dinner.  We started off with family style bruschetta, which was nicely done and had great flavor.    Second up was our choice of appetizer.  I chose the salad and Kevin chose the scallops.  He said they were great, but my salad lacked great flavor, a little underwhelming.  Third up was the main course.  Kevin had the ribeye and crab legs with potatoes and brussel sprouts, while I had the chicken with some kind of sauce with potatoes and asparagus.  We thought both were good and we even made leftovers of it the next night - still had great flavor!  The only complaint - the ribeye can't compete with our favorite place to get steaks.  Lastly was dessert.  I knew I was going for my favorite - cheesecake and Kevin went with a Chocolate mousse cake.  My cheesecake was pecan cheesecake and it was some of the best cheesecake!  Great creamy consistency and the pecans added awesome flavor.  The chocolate mousse was good and rich, but it was not going to come close to my cheesecake! :)  I did not ask, but I hope they have that cheesecake all the time, not just for restaurant week.  I would love another slice right now!  Look forward to our next time there - likely breakfast again, but dinner can be a good option there.",

Since this was our first time the waitress helped us with our menu choices. My daughter and I both got the same thing, cinnamon swirl pancakes, hash browns, eggs and chicken and apple sausages. My other daughter had the Apple French Toast and the same sides. Let me tell you, this breakfast was nothing short of excellent! I use to brag about Famous Toastery and Another Broken Egg being one the top rated for breakfast and brunch on my list, well not anymore!  At Terrace you not only get a good atmosphere, you get your money's worth. You may leave heavy, but you won't leave hungry! I'm looking forward to trying the chicken and waffles the next time I visit and it will be in the near future. If you're looking for something different from the norm come and try out Terrace, you won't be disappointed.",

Have written manager many times about leaving certain items on their dinner menu, returning to half-price wine days - but otherwise complimented the restaurant. When we moved to Ballantyne near them we ate their five times a week. We were always friendly with and known by staff & tipped very well. Never a reply. RUDE. Unless something's changed (we haven't been there for a while), we find the dinner menu less than appealing and the two dishes we loved (and told them so on numerous occasions) stop at 4PM. We rarely get out for lunch. After spending so much time and money there you'd think I'd be offered a \"wine top off\", my husband a complimentary beer. Two years of solid business and nothing. And the beat goes on.  .Try Zinicola's instead.",

It is a clean, well-run cafe/coffee shop located in the Ballantyne Village at the intersection of Hwy 521 and Ballantyne Commons.  Our most recent lunch experience introduced us to the best onion rings we have had.  They are hand-made, thickly sliced and lightly breaded.  They fry up so nicely, crisp, not greasy and are served as an appetizer or side to a meal.  The biggest comment is that they are not the thick battered grease absorbing variety served so proudly as \"beer-battered.\"  Terrace Cafe onion rings are supreme.

I have only been twice but both times have been great experiences both with service and food quality. I highly recommend getting the Berry Split as an appetizer for your table prior to your entree; it is a vanilla yogurt parfait with banana, berries, granola and honey & also a generous slice of their sour cream coffee cake that is to die for. During my first visit, I tried the Chicken and Waffles and during my second I tried the Bacon, Egg and Cheese Biscuit. Both were great selections. Their Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle is their top seller and I look forward to going back to try it! Be sure to get their early for brunch or make a reservation.",

There will be a line of people ready to eat your food, but cancelling reservations on a customer on such an important holiday for a restaurant known for brunch is just moronic.  You're creating enemies for no apparent reason.  Worst yet, when I called to talk to the hostess about it she offered no help.

Fortunately our wait was only about 5 minutes long.  The menu is super enticing if you like breakfast.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth but I will say the sweet offerings look awesome.  My fellow dining companions all ordered sweet stuff (2 got the lemon poppy french toast, served with fresh fruit and one got the bavarian stuffed french toast).  I ordered the reasonably priced($9) biscuit with sausage gravy which comes with a pile of shredded hash browns and added 2 eggs over medium). It was perfect and the eggs rounded it out well.  Shredded hashbrowns don't appear much in my neck of the woods so when I see them I get them!  These were good but could've been a bit more flavorful (even pepper would've helped).  The house hot sauce was a great compliment to my meal too.  Not too hot.    I would absolutely go there again if I was in the area.",

    "text": "Went in for a quick breakfast. I have severe lactose intolerance and normally can't eat pancakes and waffles. I noticed they had a vegan breakfast with a gluten free waffle. I asked the server (Jade I believe)  if it still contained milk. She said it did, meaning it's not vegan and shouldn't be advertised as so. So I settled on an omelet with hash browns. The only flavor I could taste in both was the clumps of salt. My fiance needed more sauce and the server never came back. After her walking past several times and purposely ignoring us, I asked for the manager. She came over and didn't seem to know much about the menu. She went to check on the waffle and said there's no milk but they're out of it. About 15 minutes later the server came by and dropped the check and took my plate without asking if I was finished. The food was edible and the service was lacking. This place is not worth the money.",

Breakfast was okay, though not stellar. Lots of food, but not food I wanted to eat every last bite of. My husband and I each had an omelette; both included lots of ingredients but were cooked a bit too dry. Side dishes were nothing special -- grits were so-so, toast was fine. Latte was competent but not awesome. Service was friendly but disinterested. Maybe our experience explains why a few of the other local spots were even more crowded than this one.",

We were seated in the new part of the restaurant, it felt like we were being punished by sitting in the other room. We were surrounded by children, loud screaming children. We ordered and the food didn't take too long! We ordered 3 Chicken Biscuits and one order of Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was fresh and tender, and the portions were large, perfect size.  The biscuit was the spiciest thing I have ever eaten. I understand it comes with ghost pepper pimento cheese but we asked the waitress if it was crazy hot and she said no. The food was good and the server was nice. It should be noted that N.C. doesn't serve booze until noon... WHY EVEN OPEN?!",

    "text": "Friday night, we went to Terrace Cafe for dinner and drinks. I couldn't keep up with everyone, so I ordered coffee. I love going to Terrace cafe because you can sit outside under the lit up trees (at the Ballantyne location) and they have unique dishes that are incredibly fresh. The cafe is hidden in the Ballantyne Village shopping plaza.   The waffle fries are probably in my top five favorites for restaurants. Their lobster BLT is really yummy too! I tried to recreate it at home and it was nowhere close. We also ordered their fried green tomatoes and YUM! Another fun appetizer they had...fried alligator. It tastes just like chicken. It's actually pretty good!  The first time I went there, I ordered the grilled chicken cobb salad. It came with egg, avocado, onion, cucumber, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, croutons, grilled chicken, cabbage, and ranch on the side. It's a great healthy choice.   I've also ordered their roasted salmon salad and it's so good! The salmon is moist and crisp on the edges. My salad came with walnuts, green apple slices, spring mix lettuce, spinach, dried cranberries, parmesan cheese (swapped for the blue cheese), and ranch on the side!  I highly recommend getting their tomato bisque soup if they have it available! It's to die for!   I also LOVE their breakfast!  I ordered the vegetable egg white omelet and added turkey bacon. It came with sauteed onions, peppers, tomatoes, and spinach. I chose the wheat toast and fresh fruit for my side. The dish came with a homemade strawberry jelly and it was unbelievably tasty!   I really want to try their bourbon salmon next time!  The service is always great and professional!",

IMHO, The \"Terrace Fried Chicken\" is the best fried chicken in town (Yes, it beats Price's Chicken Coop which I honestly haven't been overly impressed with).  Terrace also has an excellent breakfast and brunch menu.  Items worth trying are the shrimp & grits, the red velvet waffle, and the fillet medallions and eggs.  I've yet to try their fried alligator as an appetizer, despite the fact that I'm an FSU alumn and a natural a gator hater.... But it's next on the list.    T.C. gets 5 stars because they ace every area a restaurant should focus on:  1. Food 2. Service 3. Atmosphere 4. Meal Presentation.  I've caught a glimpse of the kitchen on occasion and can tell that the guys back there really know what they're doing.  This indicates to me that they pay their staff well, resulting in better food and service than the norm.",

My sister's red velvet waffles were also amazing, as she offered me some of her brunch. The setting was nice although a bit cramped. Although a place may be in a popular neighborhood, that doesn't necessarily mean the food will be up to par. I've been to diners with better benedict. So overall I gave this place 3 stars.",

    "text": "I understand that the Charlotte area doesn't possess the food scene to end all food scenes. And locals can dock me cool points for saying so, but a set of foodie friends from the area have tended toward a few standbys for their culinary cravings rather than branching out and telling me about all the great new places they're finding all the time.  Terrace Cafe is one such standby, and as a visiting patron, the one I know best. My first Terrace visit, to the Piedmont Row location, was such a treat that I was more than excited to hear that a location opened up in Ballantyne, closer to where my friends lived. Dock me a few more cool points for picking on your sprawl, Charlotte, but the commute into Southpark from Fort Mill is a bit much.  A recent trip was typical of Terrace's high standard. Let me start with this: Bacon Bloody Mary. I'm not sure why this isn't available everywhere at all hours, but Terrace is one of the first places I can remember seeing it. A friend ordered it, to my great envy, and loved every moment of the experience. I'm told it's got some heat, but still, get a little extra spicy, and -- take it away, Jack White -- make the sweat drip out of every pore. (Can I get some of those cool points back now?)  Our orders arrived faster than some of our drinks, save the obligatory waters in their Dali-esque curved glasses. This speed could make one wonder if they hadn't been on a trip to the nuke-atorium. But the food quality allayed all such thoughts. My salmon eggs Benedict (not smoked salmon, mind you, but full fledged mini fillets of the fresh catch) came out very flavorful, with eggs on top that had just the right amount of ooze. From omelets to shrimp and grits to Benedicts, we were all sated, though my one friend wasn't quite satisfied until he fished out the last bits of bacon from the bottom of his glass.  There are a few borderline signature dishes here -- the s'mores French toast or the red velvet waffle, perhaps -- but the key is that at Terrace Cafe, it's all pretty damn good. Eggs and dead-animal-variation-du-jour Benedict? I'm there. And that's more than enough to keep us coming back.",

I visited for lunch and arrived just after 11:30; we were immediately shown to a table.  Our server was quite nice and remained attentive without becoming annoying and offered what his favorites were on the menu and why he loved them.  The interior is decorated in an elegant, sophisticated manner with hints of trendyness. Large metalwork sculptures and original paintings are paired with the warm oranges and dark reds, with plenty of flowing curves. Even the tableware and glasses have an artful curve and elegance to them - it's classy without being stuffy.  We started with the bruschetta, which was a step above most others, with melt in your mouth bread as opposed to the over toasted sheet rock a lot of places serve. For my entree, I decided to see what the \"grown up grilled cheese\" was all about. It was certainly a gourmet grilled cheese, with colby jack, tomatoes, and onions between toasted sourdough.  My only critique would be that the onions were sliced a little too thin and tended to make for slightly messy eating. Flavor-wise, though, it was spot on. I upgraded to the onion rings for a side and I am glad I did - these were massive onion rings coated in a tempura batter.  My partner tried the soup of the day, an apple and fennel, and was thoroughly content.  I certainly plan to return and try the red velvet waffles they are known for, and maybe give their new dinner offerings a shot too.",

There were plenty of empty tables, however, we were shown to a table next to the kitchen with the Reserved sign.   Cocktails were prepared well and prompt.  Our waiter told us about the evening specials, they happened to be the two most expensive items on the menu.  We ordered two starters. Scallops and fried green tomatoes.  The scallops were cooked well. They were moist and flavorful. The fried green tomatoes were  over cooked.  I also ordered a crab bisque soup. The soup was warm with a lump of very cold crab at the bottom of the cup.   I ordered the Grouper (an evening special) over risotto. The fish was mushy and the risotto was gummy.  My wife ordered the New York Strip (the other evening special). It arrived covered with corn and an glob of mashed sweet potato over half of the meat. The steak was tough. An uneven cut, thin on one side. So it was over cooked on one end.  Our two guests were equally dissatisfied.  I think a special should really be special and not just a expensive menu item.  Our waiter never once ask how our meal was.  We paid the bill and tipped well. We most likely won't return.  There are too many good choices in Charlotte. Maybe it was an off night.",

For one thing, this place is so much better than the Village Bistro that was there before. Hopefully, this will be the anchor restaurant that Ballantyne Village has been needing.  The food here is very good and the portions are generous enough that I alway have leftovers. An oyster/spinach salad I had on one visit literally had at least 20 oysters on it. I ate half and took the rest home. On my last visit I had a capuccino and the hummus platter. The hummus was freshly made and the capuccino was delicious. I have not visited the bar here, but they seem to have a good selection. I also did not attend the business dinner, but received very good reviews from several of the attendees. There is a private room there, but it only holds 12 comfortably. So glad to finally have a good full service place nearby!",

I don't eat a lot of heavy/buttery foods, so the broth (actually a very buttery sauce) was a bit rich after a while, but I still ate almost all of it!",

They must think that they are The Plaza or The Waldorf. Spoke to the manager about the price of the fruit and he told us that the portion was 6oz, there were maybe 4-5 small pieces of fruit on a miniature plate. Manager needs to go back to managerial school. If you are looking for a good breakfast on a budget then look elsewhere!!",

Went yesterday after church to eat, we were told it would be a 20 mins wait with empty tables everywhere.  Finally got a seat only to realize they only service breakfast items until 2:30 and then  they close and reopen at 4.  WTF?  Not everyone wants breakfast food at 12:30 pm.  There were no signs anywhere indicating only breakfast served.  By watching some of the staff, I'd say service wasn't that great either.  You could tell some had no clue even regarding cleaning off a table.",

We then sat for 15 minutes with open menus, watching wait staff serving people all around us who came in after us. We decided we'd had enough and left. The hostess was mortified and, to her credit, offered to intervene. We declined but thanked her for her efforts. With respect to service, there is either a management or training problem in this place-haven't figured out which. Since it's been open for more than one year, it can't be a start-up issue. We've been in restaurants far bigger and more crowded than this with better service.",

It didn't really remind me of what a traditional french toast is.  BUT I was happy with what they served.  I asked for 1 small pancake for my daughter (just turned 1 year old) and they brought out a huge pancake and was charged $2 for it.....& of course she didn't eat 1 bite.  I was assuming since it was for a small child it would have been complimentary like most places.   I also ordered their well-known Red Velvet waffles to-go for my husband.  AND.....they were delicious.  Tastes exactly how you would imagine it. With my husband being a huge red velvet cake fan, he was very impressed.  It was even served with a cream cheese sauce.
