    "text": "This has only been my 2nd time at a Red Lobster EVER. It was ok. I have had better seafood elsewhere. The biscuits were by far the star of the show.   We were seated quickly for a Friday night and the server was fine.  The seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE butter but  sometimes too much of a good thing can ruin a meal. The shrimp were TINY and the Lobster Tail was TINY  It was pricey too considering we had 2 Childrens Entrees. The kids mac and cheese was Kraft. Sort of a joke really. $5,99 for Mac and Cheese from a box. When are restaurants going to get a clue and offer more than chicken fingers and mac and cheese on the kids menu? Some kids do have an adventurous spirit and will eat real food.  I may go back for a lunch and their biscuits but will probably pass on them for dinner.",

We were seated next to a booth with a happy baby who was being encouraged to squeal loudly in delight while her parent played with her. I love a happy baby, but not one who is being encouraged to be LOUD in a restaurant while others are trying to enjoy dinner with family members. It took awhile after asking, but we were able to be moved away to another table mid-meal. The meal itself was meh; the lobster seemed a little overdone and the crab not as tasty as it should have been. Our waitress was hit or miss and we waited awhile for the bill. Would not visit again.",

I've been going to Red Lobster for years with family and this was by far the worst service I've ever had.  I think the waitress may have been new so I try to give her a little break.  We went here because I was given a gift card.  The food was good as normal but it took about 15-20 min to get some of their famous buscuits.  She also took forever to bring my GF a fork so she could eat.  The shrimp was a bit over cooked but it prob just sat under the heat lamp forever because the waitress was so slow.    Overall it's still Red Lobster, it's good but the service that day was not very good.",

It was a frustrating situation but we decided to go pick up the kids and come back for dinner. We expected a wait which was fine, about 25 minutes. We got seated and it took about 10 minutes before we saw our waiter and then another 10 before we got our drinks. Our salad and bread came out with our food which was a little irritating. Our waiter was obviously swamped, I don't think there was a time where I didn't see him running around correcting orders. He was great but everything else was EXTREMELY slow. We got our food, which was actually not exactly what we ordered but it was corrected (eventually). We will probably not be back to this location, I'd rather drive to Gastonia if I really want Red Loster.",

Like i said i understand it was busy but that is no excuse for how gross the bathroom was. i almost threw up from the smell and you could just tell that it probably had not been cleaned all day. I believe when you are an establishment with meals over $10 your bathroom should be spotless. This is something you would expect from burger king or somewhere, not red lobster.

Then when we didn't eat the cold food,  we were told \"we don't give doggie bags for endless shrimp if you don't eat it\".  So, don't take it home to reheat. They toss it and you pay for it.   That's OK,  its America...  Let's waste food while others starve.  The attitude and service of our waiter we could have been friendlier, we could have done without attitude. Not to mention the broccoli my son ordered was molded and  turned upside down in its dish. The kitchen manager tried to convince me it was seasoning. Really?

    "text": "My wife and her family took me here for my birthday, the service was ok we had about 12 people nothing too big. We had two servers both were pretty nice. We ordered food kept it going like a normal service I got the Bar Harbor and it was pretty awesome I got them to add Cajun seasoning into it since I like spicy food. But rather good couldn't complain.  BUT my wife's grandma got a steak and Lobster, she order a medium and it came out well done and her lobster was raw no idea how this happened considering you cook them at two different times but so be it. She sent it back and by the time she got it back we had already ate all our food and had finished desert. I mean what the heck how does it take that long to cook a medium steak? It doesn't! By the time she got her food she wasn't hungry anymore.  So we get the checks and the server tells me that the manager comped her food since it was messed up and that we wouldn't have to worry about paying for it. Well then they gave her another bill and said that she had to pay for it how the hell that works is beyond me, but she was stuck paying for the damn food that the manager told us we would get credited.   Near the end of the service the servers lacked and kind of vanished and it was just a huge cluster. The quality of this place just tanked and fell low.  The only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb!!! Everything else is a joke.",

    "text": "I had my parents over for the weekend and my parents are like most and they are fairly weird. This time the weird discussion revolves around my father and his love of eating establishments in particular  Red Lobster.  I must admit I was biased and am one of those persons that considers Red Lobster the McDonalds of seafood so this would typically not be a place I would visit to eat.   Surprisingly this visit was very good. I have a few horror stories of other Red Lobster's but this one end with everyone smiling and cheering. We drove to this restaurant in separate vehicles and the first thing I noticed is how far the handicap parking spaces are from the entrance. My parents park in those spaces and it was a hike for them to make it to the front door. I guess they want handicapped parking folks to get the most exercise  to build up for the meal. I am not sure of the planning or thoughts they have on parking. I am just thankful it was a beautiful day.   Entering the restaurant and all the employees were kind and smiling. They sat us all within about 15 minutes. My father ordered his usual admiral feast, I had a lobster pizza (watching calories). Wife had a pasta dish, my mother had the stuffed founder and my kids had fries.   It was all delicious! Cooked to perfection and served timely. My father even went out of his way to say this was they best one he has been to in a long time.   The bill was $101 and that's not bad for 6 people eating.   I recommend this location.",

Just as an example, our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. Never received a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time, either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.  As far as the food went, it was good - I had the Admiral's Feast, which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up.  I just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.  As far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward.",

    "text": "So it's been almost 4 years since I've eaten at this restaurant because of my last experiences being so horrible. I swore I would never eat at this restaurant again, but I thought I would give it another chance and I went out with a group of friends and we were having a small party or three-year-old's birthday.  It took him more than 20 minutes to seat us and then another 15 to 20 before they even came to take our drink water. It wasn't just me that had a horrible experience, but everyone's Order at our table was messed up. My own personal nightmare began with a waiter who only had our table and could not get anything right. Some of the items that are on the menu that are very special he kept saying they were out of, only for us to find out a little bit later they have never been out of them. My salad and my supra brought out at exactly the same time, and when I requested them bring my suit back later, they brought me back A bowl of very cold soup. When my entree arrived, it was not what I ordered. I requested that they bring me back what I ordered, and I was given \"That look\". I finally got my order and it was edible. My sweet potato fluff was freezing cold inside. I almost thought that we were on one of those comity hidden camera shows because my experience was the same with every other person at the table and there were six adults. As I said earlier, we were there for three-year-old's birthday, and they never brought her her dessert or saying happy birthday to her. All in all, I don't care who's birthday it is or how special someone else, I will NEVER step foot in this particular location EVER again!!!",

    "text": "I did give this 4 stars, but I'm updating my review after a recent visit. The service is SLOW! We came here twice before on a Sunday. There is no waiting and we got seated right away. Thinking since they weren't so packed, that the service would be better. Not. Every time we have came here when they are busy service has been great, but when they are slow they ARE slow. Maybe not enough motivation for the staff? Don't know what's up.... However cheddar bay biscuits make life better :-)  -------- Original review posted September 2015   My husband and I came here last night for all you can eat shrimp around 6:30pm. The wait for 2 was an hour n a half long so we decided to eat at the bar (no matter what time, this location always has a wait). I usually don't like eating at the bar, but our bartenders were awesome! Before we even ordered we were given the cheesy bay biscuits and waters. Score! We both ordered the all you can eat shrimp and our order came out in less than 15 minutes. We were also provided drink refills no questions asked, which was great because I hate when you sit there with an empty glass and they don't refill it without you asking.   In addition, there were 2 other couples next to us enjoying all you can eat shrimp. Eventually the bartenders caught on and starting bringing out shrimp by the dozen. Without even ordering another round they would present different shrimp options to us. It truly was all you can eat shrimp!!! It started to become humorous because at one point they brought out more shrimp, but we were all so full and no one wanted it. Needless to say we left full and with boxes of extra shrimp to take home.   The only reason why I gave this 4 stars over 5 is because we did have slow service once in the dining room, but the food was delicious so no complaints from the food category.",

They were very similar to the shrimp scampi, which is another personal favorite but with a delicious cheesy breading....then they are baked again and come out hot and overflowing with cheese. Soooo good!  However, all the other options were great too. We also enjoyed the shrimp pasta which was full of flavor, the fried shrimp that were crispy and the glaze on the Teriyaki Grilled Shrimp was so tasty!

I used to love Red Lobster's attention to high quality seafood and service; however, this location has put a horrible taste in my mouth for the chain. Hubby and I purchased the Lobsterfest Surf n Turf, which is supposed to have the lobster chunks and cream sauce on top of the steak. Got home and the steak was bare with no topping, we received no clarified butter with our lobster, which was dry and seemed overcooked, and the caesar salad was only some brown stained lettuce with croutons thrown in and no parmesan shavings! I called and was referred to the manager and waited 10 minutes before she finally came to the phone. She was apologetic and offered me a gift card, but this was a terrible experience for $87. I believe the place should either get new management or close down fast!!!",

This will go down as the #1 worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  I am not kidding.  To say this location has gone downhill is an understatement. I will spare you all the details of what happened, but our waiter was so fed up that he WALKED out...as in quit. Shocking!!! No, not really bc the management there really sucks. Jerald the GM, and his manager Chris need to take some lessons in customer service.  Then, Jerald says...hope you will give us another try in the future.  NOT!!!!! We waited almost 2 hrs for the food to arrive. Then, the orders were not correct.  Trying to talk to both of these managers was like  talking to a brick wall. I would suggest to the both of you that if you don't like your job, please find a new one.  Also, work on your customer service skills. This place was an unorganized,chaotic mess. I have never seen anything like what I saw here last weekend. Thank goodness my Red Lobster here in Phoenix knows how to talk to, and treat their customer base. I am going to let everyone I know not to eat at this location. What is even more upsetting is that i suggested we go here. That was a bad decision on my part, it will NEVER happen again. Red Lobster in Pineville, NC...I have officially divorced you!   Sincerely,   Disgusted!! :|",

Then our food comes out and my flounder comes out half raw . Only thing good was the biscuits but besides that only thing I could eat . Horrible experience and for the price is not worth it at all ! I been going to red lobster since I was a little girl and they always been good but this location was horrible. Probably why there was only three people inside when we walked in .",

    "text": "Well, I hate to give this place 2 stars because I haven't been to Red Lobster in a while and like to give businesses the benefit of doubt... in most cases. However, the ball was just dropped two many times for me ignore (honest Yelper here).   I tried the Concord location but there was an hour wait, since it was Saturday my friend and I were up for the mini journey to enjoy our dinner at the Carolina Mall location (our hearts were set on Red Lobster, can you tell? Lol). We arrived and were told it was about a 40 minute wait but could be shorter since it was just two of us. We were seated in about 30 minutes, so all was good there. Once we were seated... that's where things went sour...  Charles (our waiter and the sole reason this place received two stars from me instead of one) arrived at our table after about 10 minutes and was ready to take our orders and my drink order. (Disclaimer: Charles was under a lot of pressure and did his best to handle the issues, so kudos to him!) For starters, I was unable to eat my Caesar Salad due to it being drenched in dressing, after we got our waters... my drink didn't get made by the bar until 25 minutes after the order was put in... only to arrive without ANY alcohol (no, seriously) so it was a straight smoothie...oh, but it didn't end there.   After receiving my order of peppercorn sirloin, I cut into the steak only to have blood pour out over the plate and onto my mashed potatoes. Yuck! No way, I'm eating that... I understand Medium-rare but this was just rare. My waiter gladly took the plate back to them remake my steak. I cut the entire steak in half, which in any other restaurant would lead them to remake my order completely.... Nope! I got my exact two crispy pieces back without any thought on presentation (see the pic). Charles clearly saw that I wasn't pleased so I got a free dessert... but that went my friend, because at that point I was just ready to go.   Needless to say, I will not revisit this location again. Thanks but no thanks. I will just take my loss on Red Lobster and eat elsewhere if the Concord location has a long wait.",

At 9pm they were on a wait so we went to the bar area. The bar was filthy with dishes everywhere. They were also doing some type of repairs on the floors so wood planks were all over. It took a while to be greeted. While waiting, I pushed all dishes to the side and once bartender asked our drink order, I asked him to wipe it down. Crab legs were cold & anorexic to say the least. As was the broccoli (cold). One cluster was missing a leg so I brought it to the bartenders attention and he brought me another cluster. Can't say I'll be rushing to go back anytime soon",

First of all, the water tasted gross! The Tiki passion punch had wayyyy too much syrup. Then we ordered shrimp and mashed potatoes. They gave us the end of the mashed potatoes which were portioned for a toddler. When we advised the waitress, she sad they didn't have anymore so it would take a few minutes to make some. Our sesame shrimp was RAW and had no orange coloring. I then ordered some parmesan crusted shrimp and she said they ran out of Parmesan crust so they melted \"fresh\" Parmesan cheese on the shrimp which you could barely tell! I requested to speak to a manager and the manager lacked empathy and took my friends plate before even asking if she was done! The service and food for a chain restaurant were completely unacceptable and I will never come back to this particular Red Lobster again.",

And with Red Lobster we thought we could definitely eat our money's worth of shrimp, which we did but the experience wasn't one we would be in a hurry to repeat.   First off when we show up the hostess says she will go clear a table for us. Even though it was later on a weeknight and definitely not busy. She was gone for several minutes while we waited alone and awkwardly out front.  We get to our table and wait quite a long time for our waiter who was friendly when he showed up. He explained the AYCE deal and took our order and disappeared for a bit. When the deal came out my salad, which was ordered with dressing on the side, came without any dressing. He went back to fix it but again was gone for maybe 10 minutes.   We tried several shrimp options. My favorite was the Mediterranean grilled shrimp. The shrimp scampi was super chewy. The coconut shrimp was okay. The Nashville hot shrimp weren't hot. The garlic shrimp skewers were ok. The popcorn shrimp were unappealing with undercooked breading. Eww.   Each smaller serving was served on its own plate and no one bussed any of the plates including the huge platters we were each given to start. It made for a cramped and less than pleasant dining experience.   The food was mediocre, the service slow. With so much competition nearby I doubt I would choose Red Lobster again.",

Probably my favorite cesar from any restaurant. Weird, I know.

I grew up on the coast, so when we wanted seafood red lobster was never a place that came to mind. That is until they announced their endless shrimp promotion! I love shrimp, so I figured if there was ever a good time to give red lobster a try this would be it. The service was pretty standard and comparable to any big chain restaurant, not outstanding but good. Now I can't comment on some of the other food they offer at red lobster but that endless shrimp promotion was amazing! They start you off with biscuits and a side salad. Then the entree is any two types of shrimp and two sides. Now, at this point I was pretty full but being the shrimp lover that I am I had to keep muscling down more. Every few minutes our server would come over and ask what we wanted to try next and as advertised, the shrimp were endless they just kept bringing out more.  At the end of the meal, we had three boxes of leftover food to bring home! If stuffing your face like this wasn't such a health hazard, I would be there every night.",

The host wrote down our group information wrong when we're came in, and rather than just correcting it and getting us in as soon as possible, they deleted us from the list 30 minutes after we'd arrived and made us start our wait over. It was an hour before we were seated. Then it was another hour before we received our food. All of the plates were scalding hot, meaning they'd been sitting under heat lamps for a while. My broccoli arrived raw, and my lobster tail was so burned and overcooked that it felt like sawing through leather. Several of our sides didn't make it out at all, and they forgot several people's salads. To be fair, I think our server was excellent and did what she could, but it couldn't make up for the rest. I'd bother to complain to the management about it if I thought it would make any difference. Hopefully corporate will be more responsive. We arrived at 5:30pm and couldn't leave until 8:15pm.",

I then waited another 25 mins for my meal. By the time I got to my car I was thinking it might have been quicker to just eat there. Other than the length it took to place and receive my order, everything was fine.",

Salad was hot, over 25 minutes had gone by and no food was brought to the table after we ordered. The order was simple nothing complicated. Come to find out the waiter forgot to put our order in. I have a toddler that was hungry and wanted her food. Manager said it was going to take an additional 30 more minutes for the food since it was never put in. We immediately said no and left. Manager took care of the whole check, but we will not be going to back here ever again.",

    "text": "So this visit to Red Lobster was fabulous!  It's crab fest so I decided to just dive in and order crablegs . A pound of snow crab & dungeness crablegs was my choice tonight with a cup of clam chowder and a cheese biscuit.  So the soup was delicious and hot ! The biscuits are so good it should be illegal to serve them !  The crablegs were fresh and simply delicious!  I only wish I had started with the dungeness crablegs first cause by the time I ate my way down to that cluster I was so full ! But hey ... I took one for the team and ate 'em !  For heavens sake get to Red Lobster and eat those crab legs before they're gone ...  are they ever really gone tho ?  It's Red Lobster...  I'm pretty sure it's a staple on the menu .... but just in case .... run don't walk ... get here .  It's so worth it.  Don't waste you're money on the fried seafood go for those delicious crablegs. They won't disappoint!",

She was so busy that she forgot to bring us our salads before the meal and my meal was served by someone else without my crab legs that I had to wait for after I was already done with my meal. She then took forever to get us boxes, our forgotten food (to-go) and the check, I'm talking 20 minutes. Idk if they need to train their staff better or they just have low standards but do yourself a favor and skip this location.",

We had the reservation for 7:20 on a Wednesday, didn't get seated til 7:50, took a while for our drinks to get ordered and then for our food to be ordered. They were pretty busy. The waiting area was pretty full and all the benches were taken up. Got some of our food at 9:10 and the rest later. They forgot my uncles food and didn't give him his until 9:30 or so after everyone was done eating. We left at 10:00 finally. We came to celebrate my brothers 16th birthday. They had a little cheesecake and whipped cream for him but no candle.   Our waitresses and servers were kind and helped us. The food just took forever to come out. They told us another party behind us was big so that's probably why we didn't receive any food until after hey left. The steak was a little too dry but well done like we asked. The salmon was great and the tilapia wasn't too fishy. The broccoli and mashed potatoes were too salty for me and my cousins. The bacon and potato soup was thick and there wasn't any bacon in the soup - just bacon flavoring.   Overall it was about 340 with tip for about 14 people (5 kids meals). $290 before tip. Everyone mainly just got water as well. It's about your average franchise dinner with a longer wait. Nothing spectacular or anything that exceeds your expectations.",

I hope it goes far in terms of improvements.   I hope cleaniness improves.  I hope server training takes place more often.  I hope kitchen communication and expo'ing takes some training seminars and improve vastly over my latest visit. So,  this way ....when things that are on NATIONAL PROMO then they'll have items in stock.    Moreover they'll recall what the pictures look like when plating then actually plate the entree with all the items at once. And, maybe they'll bring the servers in on that training also teaching mindfulness or alertness but I honestly ain't trying to be bratty about my visit as I've had plenty but these are genuine tips for improvement to avoid the most basic mess ups like not plating the entire entree, not having things in stock, not communicating with each other so the customer doesn't have to bring it up 14 minutes later \"Hey, will I receive my lobster tail and scallops?\"   Thanks to the GM for the comp but I'd rather pay full price and get what I'm supposed to receive versus missing out on something.   Also, watch your server as ours (on this last visit) put his thumb in the salad as he picked it up to place it on the table. Yep~ we started rough while he sniffed his nose all night. Le sigh.",

The dishes included a couple of pick your combination with fried shrimp and bay scallops; the infamous \"admirals feast\"; and linguine with shrimp. Just some righteous fried food! The service was outstanding and Reggie should be up for an Oscar for his performance (5/5).  Drinks were full constantly and chedda biscuits ample!

My drink was topped off often and my needs were anticipated.  However, the food is nothing like I remember.  The salad was served in a warm bowl so my greens were warm and starting to wilt.  There was also a ton of dressing on the salad and there was at least two tablespoons on the bottom of the bowl when I was finished.  I got the stuffed mushrooms and I got six tiny mushroom caps filled with not much stuffing.  The mushrooms were no bigger than a size of a nickel, and I was used to larger mushrooms, quarter size or larger.  I also got the Admiral's Feast which is fried fish, shrimp, scallops, and clams.  The shrimp are not like they used to be.  There was way too much breading on the shrimp and it wasn't the delicate breading like I remember.  Everything else was good.  I was extremely disappointed in the salad and the shrimp but didn't complain because they were still edible.  My leftovers were reheated in the oven the following day and tasted just fine.",

I usually wouldn't go but they were running their all you can eat shrimp promotion and I always remember having a positive experience with it. The place was jammed of course and we had an hour and a half wait. Once we sat down it took quite a while before our waitress came to get our drink order. Once we actually placed our food order it took another 45 minutes for the food to come out. We of course ordered the shrimp and received some shrimp scampi for our first order. The shrimp was over cooked and very dry. The mashed potatoes I received as a side were also dry and cold. The next orders were more of the same. After spending over 60 bucks on dinner I had a ton of buyers remorse. I'm sure this review won't hurt the behemoth that is red lobster. But do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.",

We got charged wrong at the end of our service ($20 more on the other tab) and they can't refund it immediately so we had two charges ($50 and $70) for a few days which can be pretty inconvenient. The decor needs is pretty outdated and for some reason it smells in there. Like.... bad. Maybe from the lobster tank? I don't know, but i don't think they should keep that in the waiting area.

So just four people and to start we ordered some  fried shrimp, some scampi, and some scallops. Unfortunately the fried shrimp were the best. Both of the others were terrible over cooked. We didn't complain because I simply won't do that. So for our main courses my gf ordered the something lobster bake, my daughter ordered the lobster and her bf got the trout, (which  they came back and informed us they were out of) so he had the salmon.  It was ALL OVER COOKED. Rubbery, just tough, all of it. It was just a shame because I wanted to have a good dinner with my daughter before she left town, she was here for the Holliday. Anyway, I just thought that being such a big chain restaurant and seafood based with \"Lobster\" in the name that the food would be better.  I mean the service was good the waiters name was Ty and he was attentive and helpful but the food was very disappointing. I hope that they can use the constructive criticism to help get things together.",

I read previous reviews before ordering but decided to give it a go anyways. Trust the reviews, don't waste your time.",

    "text": "Got there just before  1pm. Got seated about 1:30.  Waiter shows up at 1:40, takes drink order. Drinks show up 15 minutes later, waiter disappears. 2:15, reappears and takes dinner order. You get the picture. We didnt get out of there until 3:30. Food nothing spectacular.  About 1/3 of tables are empty even though there were 20 some people waiting to be seated. It was apparent they were lacking competent help in the kitchen.  Too many other chioces to eat.  Will not return",
