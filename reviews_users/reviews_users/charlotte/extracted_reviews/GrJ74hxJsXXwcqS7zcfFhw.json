IF I had to recommend one thing I would recommend going to the Uptown location and leave this one alone.",

We have had the good fortune of meeting Nate and Jamaar through our visits over the years.  They both worked yesterday and using the word exceptional does not give them justice for our experience.  They brought my daughter some fruit to the table without us asking because they remembered she liked blueberry, blackberry and raspberry medley.  They continued to check on us and when we were done they had them pull our car upfront to the door and made sure to put the AC on high because it was 100 degrees outside.  The icing on the cake \"literally\" is that they even put a to go desert in the passenger seat of my car.  If you ever get a chance to experience the Ruth Chris in Charlotte be sure to ask for Nate and Jamaar.  Tell them Ty Norwood sent you to ensure you get the royal treatment.  I will be back again soon.  The steak and the stuffed chicken breast are the best.  Enjoy.",

They were my favorite part of the salad. So yum. Decided to do the $10 upgrade to the kings feast. I mean $10 for 5 extra ounces of filet mignon...its really a no brainer. Medium rare please and green beans,mashed potatoes and onion rings as sides. Steak comes out sizzling, cooked perfectly to my liking(kinda on the rarer side) and at least 2 inches thick. Birthday steak wish granted. Sides were good as well. The green beans really stood out. Since it was a special occasion our waitress had 2 complementary glasses of wine delivered to the table. No idea what wine it was but it was amazing. Seriously, i could have easily downed a bottle or two of it (Im trying to keep it classy, i promise).  Onto dessert. To me it usually feels like dessert is kinda an afterthought at most restaurants. I was very impressed with the 3 dessert sampler they offered. It featured a slice of chocolate espresso cake, a small cheesecake and a raspberry sorbet. Again, awesome and exceeded my expectations.  I will definitely be back as i have dreams to one day order the \"porterhouse for two\" for one.",

    "text": "The problem with Ruth's Chris is that it's named \"Ruth's Chris\".  The name is synonymous with high priced, high quality steaks.  So saying that Ruth's is your favorite steakhouse is a bit like saying that Tiger Woods is your favorite golfer.    But the simple fact is that their steaks are absolutely phenomenal.  \"Oh, but it's expensive and the menu isn't that great and their wine is overpriced, etc.\" I agree.  But their steaks are phenomenal.    I don't go to Ruth's Chris that often.  But when I do, I don't go for the wine, the side dishes, the ounce-to-dollar value ratio, the soup or the salad.  I go to have steak.  And I'm never disappointed.  I thought about penalizing Ruth's for one star because I personally prefer restaurants with a little more \"soul\" to them than Ruth's Chris can offer.  As a chain, it's just not able to deliver the kind of culture I enjoy.  But in the context that it's in, (a high priced chain of restaurants) it does a pretty amazing job of delivering such a high level of consistency.  So, I gave Ruth's Chris 5 stars.  Whether it's cool to say or not, my taste buds tell me that their steaks are worth every penny.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying this is a review a year in the making as I actually visited Ruth Chris- Southpark last year for restaurant week and was reminded of my experience since that time has come around again this year. I was really excited to visit this place for the first time as Ruth Chris franchise is very well known and I'm a steak and potatoes guy at heart. So I figured I'd give a classy steakhouse a try seeing how I had pretty much tried in the middle of the road ones you can try (longhorn,outback, texas roadhouse etc) My date and I and reservations for a Sunday evening so getting seated was not an issue. There was a fairly good amount of people there as you would expect for the first evening of the special menu, but it wasn't bursting at the seams busy. However, the sluggish service throughout the whole dining experience felt like their staff couldn't handle the extra foot traffic. I had allotted a good amount of stomach space for this meal so I wasn't really happy with living off plain ol bread and water for what seemed like an eternity.  Their restaurant weekend menu wasn't really impressive once you tasted and viewed the seemingly reduced portions they were dishing out. Anything worth having really required an \"upgrade\" which really defeats the purpose of getting a quality experience at a 30 per person price point. The appetizers made it to us not very long after the entrees. We really didn't start eating until maybe 45 minutes after we had sat down. The ribeye I had wasn't bad by any means, but I was certainly not blown away by it and actually got bored with it before I finished. If I hadn't tanked up on bread and water I doubt it would have felt like a filling meal. The cheesecake desert was just a little sliver just enough to quench  a sugar fix but it was very forgettable. Maybe it was just an off night which sucks because I wanted to love this place so bad and it has many positive reviews. I just can't see myself going out of my way to visit a Ruth Chris restaurant again and pay premium prices when I've easily had better steak experiences at other places.",

All meat is US Prime, and is cooked in an oven (seasoned with only salt and pepper) then placed on a 500 degree plate with hot butter. The steak is really the best around, in my opinion, FAR surpassing places like Morton's Of Chicago or The Palm, not only in taste, but as well as atmosphere and service.  It is a bit pricey, but it is superb, and for special occasions or business dinners it is the best around. I HIGHLY suggest this restaurant and really can't say enough about it, it's that good.  (For 2 people expect to pay around $90 - $120 [Without wine or other alcoholic beverages])",

Having had the exact same thing a day earlier (excessive, I know), the comparison is inevitable.  I felt as if my filet was just ok.  It was slightly on the bland side and more rare than I expected (a good thing depending on how you like it).  The thing I don't like about Ruth's Chris is their overuse of butter.  My steak came out in covered and practically swimming in butter.  Service was pretty damn good for our party of 10 and our waiter even engaged us in some good wine talk, so this review gets a boost.  4 stars.  Ruth's is adequate for your above average steakhouse, but if you can swing it, try Del Friscos instead, it's not too far away.",

My husband and I decided to take advantage of the Charlotte Restaurant Week special for my birthday dinner at the South Park location today.  In the past, we've ordered off the regular priced menu. My favorite is the bone-in cowboy ribeye (normally $55.00 or more). Always butter meltingly tender and has the wonderful \"char.\"  We thought, \"let's take advantage of the special discounted price for the Queen's Feast,\" even though the 14 oz ribeye has a $10.00 up charge ($45.00).  Boy, were we both disappointed...we thought the purpose of Restaurant week was to showcase the menu and quality of the restaurant so patrons would like to come back and experience their regular menu.  Based on their performance tonight, we would not have returned.   The ribeye looked very pretty but was not butter meltingly tender and we both ordered ours at medium rare. It was a definite downgrade on their \"normal\" steaks. It was chewy and dry. Our sides were good (wedge salad, garlic potatoes and sauteed mushrooms) but the dessert (cheesecake) tasted dry and store bought. We did splurge on a $100.00 bottle of wine which was up to Chris Ruth's normal standards.   In our opinion, save your time and money and forego their restaurant week specials.  Go during their regular menu and experience the REAL steaks, you won't be disappointed.",

I am always on the search for a good steak and Charlotte has plenty of \"ruth-like\" places where you order a ridiculously expensive steak and then share a couple sides.  But somehow out of all the places I always return to my first love.    I just simply love the food here.  The steak just has NOT been beat in my opinion.  I always get the filet and it always melts in my mouth and I can always cut it with a butter knife or fork.  It is tender, it is juicy, it requires no additional seasoning, it is PERFECT.  The sides not just compliments to the meal, they are essential and just as good as the main dish.  I love their mashed potatoes (regular or sweet), their broccoli au gratin is amazing, and you can close your eyes and point to any of the salads listed and you will be satisfied.    I haven't tried all of the desserts but their bread pudding makes me want to jump for joy.  Food excites me.  It's weird.  I know.  This last visit to Ruth's was for a special celebration and I didn't think the quality of service was up to par.  They seemed rushed and our server seemed to go missing quite frequently.  They just didn't have that \"it\" factor this time for some reason.  It was the day after Christmas so maybe that is why...I don't know.  Normally I walk in and am greeted as if I was their special guest and I leave feeling like I was treated like royalty.  This time, not so much.  However, I don't care because the food was all that and then some.  I would still return again and again because they just do it right!!  If anyone has suggestions on a place they have been that tops this steak I want to hear about it!  Don't tell me the Palm, Flemmings, Sullivan's  or Del Friscoes.  I have compared all of those places.  Until then....much love to Ruthy :)",

This time my friends and I attended on New Year's Eve 2017 for my  friend's daughter 21st birthday. The service and food was great! We did not have to wait.  The restaurant was nicely decorated for Christmas. I ordered the stuffed chicken breast and green beans.  They were seasoned very good. They give you generous size portions.  One of my friends ordered the petite steak; the texture was too tough. The manager did a good job of making sure my friend got another steak that was to her expectations and he took it off her bill. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and location.",

Everyone went with beef, mostly filets and we were all pleased with our orders. There was a slight mixup on the NY strip we ordered. Not sure what the mixup was but it wasn't available with the rest of the food. They cooked a ribeye as quickly as possible and brought it out for my son to have something to eat while the strip was cooked. Not ideal as he didn't order a ribeye but was full by the time the strip arrived. So not ideal for a family dinner but as a dad I was excited to have an extra steak to take home and eat the next day so the value of the meal increased in my eyes. The sides were very good. Sweet potato casserole was the favorite. Mashed potatoes and lobster Mac and cheese were also very good.",

When the bartender and manager learned the reason for our trip, they extended their condolences and hospitality. When I tried to show them my wife's picture and my phone battery went dark, they charged it... right there at the bar! My Manhattan and my friend's Scotch were poured with perfection. The calamari and the ahi tuna appetizers were enough to provide a delicious meal. They were followed by a round of drinks and a toast to the most wonderful woman I'll ever know. This was more than exemplary food, beverages, and service. This was a kindness and human empathy that is so very rare and precious. I will always view Ruth's Chris Steak House as an extension of our family, from now on. I humbly thank you...",

The wait was longer than expected, but the hostess and managers kept coming by to apologize for the delay. Everyone there was very friendly. Even though we had our assigned waitress, others would come by and bring water or bring more bread. In regards to the food. I had a ribeye. Cooked to my liking medium rare..the steak itself tasted like is was seasoned with \"montreal steak seasoning\"...while the ribeye is my favorite cut, I've had a better tasting elsewhere. My side was the creamed spinach, it was nice and creamy with a buttery taste. The wedge salad was also good, could've used a bit more dressing (it's more of a drizzle) and more bacon. I added the sweet potato casserole as an extra side since I heard so much about it...by far it was the most delicious and the thing that I would give 5 stars. I'm big on steals so it was great to get out and experience a new place, I would be back, if for nothing else but the sides.",

However, with that being said, we were rushed through our meal, and although it was a special occasion, a birthday celebration, and this was pre-arranged with the reservation... that did not matter.  Also, it was odd.  At the end, in the push to get us out.. the waiter still asked the birthday person what they wanted for their dessert, then brought out both a \"complimentary\" house dessert with candle AND then a second dessert, which was ultimately not needed, and then we were charged for this one, too.  So, four desserts, three people, and hardly any time to enjoy.  And we begged for a second cup (refill) of our coffee to go with.  They charge enough for it!   Over-all, pretty nervy.  There are many top-notch steaks available in Charlotte.  I think I'll be going elsewhere next time.",

We had a drink at the bar first; the bartender was nice but seemed a little overwhelmed and slow.  Once we were seated, we waited forever for our server to come over.  We were just about to get up and leave when he finally appeared.  He then introduced himself and wanted to shake my fella's hand, which seemed odd especially considering we were about to eat.    We decided to fire it up a little and ordered a $100 half bottle of wine.  The sommelier came over to open it, which was nice, but he said he got some cork in the bottle while he was opening it.  He then came back with an already decanted bottle of wine.  Now, we're no fancy pants wine tasters, and we have no idea if he indeed opened a new bottle of the same wine or just brought us some leftover Franzia.  We ordered the BBQ shrimp appetizer, which was good, and the petite filets for dinner, which were also good.    This is the third time we've been in probably six months, and each time we keep hoping the service will get better, but no luck.",

    "text": "High-end steakhouses are tough to get a handle on review-wise. Due to the prices, expectations are high and consistency and quality are expected whether you are taking clients there on an expense account, have a special occasion, or just go there for dinner whenever. I have been to many Ruth's Chris locations throughout the country and this one is most deserving of a five-star review. The food has always been consistent and high quality, but it is the service that really sets it apart.    The service standard here really is demonstrably higher than other steakhouses in Charlotte, and honestly a good bit better than other Ruth's Chris locations. That goes for hostesses, bartenders, expediters, manager, everybody.   We always ask for Miles. There are several Michaels here but Michael Miles will make sure you are happy like nobody else, and he is who you want to ask for. He knows what to recommend and how to make sure your steaks come out just right, which is seemingly a rare thing these days. For example I got a completely well-done New York strip at Fleming's recently and the server actually argued with me that it was medium-rare. I don't take pictures of my food but I may start posting them just so somebody else doesn't waste $65 on an overcooked steak. Which reminds me, I need to review Fleming's. Medium rare is perfectly medium rare at this Ruth's Chris no matter what cut you order. I always order my steaks charred medium rare here, which is apparently Ruth's favorite, and similar to a Pittsburgh but done a touch above rare. Perfect if you ask me and they always get it right here. I just can't get this cook done right at any other steakhouse in Charlotte.  Anyway, you will definitely enjoy yourself at this Ruth's Chris location, and I can guarantee that if you make sure to ask for (Michael) Miles. There is a very high service standard here among everyone, but he is the best I have seen. Also, Chris Brown is a great manager who will make sure you are happy.",

    "text": "This was both my wife and my first visit to Ruth's Chris.  We had 7:15p reservations on a Saturday night for restaurant week.  We rolled in about 7:10p and dropped the car with the complimentary valet.  We checked in with the hostess and were seated within about 5 minutes.  We were greeted by a nice waiter, Tony, by our last name.  He had read the notes from our reservation and did a nice job welcoming us and explaining the menu, service, etc.    For our meals, my wife ordered:  Steakhouse salad w/ Ranch Stuffed Double Breast of Chicken Creamed Corn Cheesecake/Chocolate Bark Duo  I had...  Wedge Salad w/ Bleu Cheese Petite Filet (medium rare plus) w/ Blackened Shrimp Creamed Spinach Cheesecake/Chocolate Bark Duo  The bread and butter were both delicious.  One thing I was bummed about was they cleared our bread with our salad and I would have loved to keep it for our meal.  The butter on the sizzling plate would have been wonderful on the bread.  Salads were both good....I think the wedge was better than the regular steakhouse...it seemed rather basic.  The entree's really were the stars.  My filet was just wonderful.  I loved it so much.  The flavor, the temp, the butter....it was just perfect!  My wife's chicken was also really delicious.  It was a generous portion and she only finished about half and took the rest home.  I cannot brag on the steak enough.  It was def. a 5 star steak!  The sides were just alright for us.  None of the restaurant week options for sides were really of interest for us so we ended up only eating about 1/3 of each side.  Wish we could have traded them for others.  Even for a minimal upcharge I think it would have been worthwhile.    For dessert, the cheesecakes were delicious.  A few really fresh sweet berries on top were nice.  The bark was not bark....it was melted on both of our plates (I imagine from the plates being warm out of the dishwasher or something).  It couldn't be picked up so it was more of a sauce.  Taste was still okay but textually a little bit of a flop.  Overall, we really enjoyed our meal.  The food and service were both good.  Not exceptional as some reviews say, but I also give a little more grace in restaurant week when it is slammed.  I did have to dock a star despite my steak being a home run because (1) both my wife and I on separate instances had to request refills on our tea.  That shouldn't happen in a fine dining place. (2) mashed potatoes were dropped at our table which we didn't order.  I thought maybe it was a nice gesture since it was our first time.  A few moments later they were retrieved and delivered to another table 3 of 4 tables down from us.  Food should never be given to another table once it has been delivered to one table...especially something as inexpensive as mashed potatoes (3) the chocolate bark wasn't bark...it was melted (4) we would have liked bread with our entree...at least ask us if you can take our bread and we would have said no.   In the end, it I had limitless resources, I would eat their steak everyday.  It was the best steak of my life---no joke.  I wanted to give 5 stars, I really did...but enough little things add up.",

    "text": "I love steak, I love steakhouse, and I hated Ruth's Chris.  Why did I hate it?  Abuse of the brand.  I went to a financial presentation, the hook is that they give you a free dinner.  Thinking it had to be a good deal because it was at Ruth's Chris was my mistake.  I knew it would be a cheaper degraded menu to manage costs.  I didn't realize Ruth's Chris would allow you to go so low and to do such a poor job delivering on it.  What was the food?  6oz of a sirloin or whatever with 'king' shrimp on it (they showed us the menu for a scant second, I assume to keep us from leaving once we saw what was in store).  This was small and had some shrimp on it.  What they left out was the flavor - the shrimp was overcooked as was the steak.  There were 6 people at my table, no less than half the steaks were overcooked.  Not overcooked slightly so I am being very picky, but so overcooked people left large portions of a 6oz steak on the plate.  If you are willing to serve food worse than a TGI Fridays to people then you really can't claim to be a good restaurant.  I would have gladly fed my meal to a dog, it wasn't rancid or harmful.  It was just a terrible execution of an incredibly cheap menu.  Ruth's Chris was complicit with duping the guests of the retirement advisers.  The salad - it was worse than a pizza parlor salad.  It was iceberg lettuce in little tiny pieces, many of which were brown on the edges.  It had a flavorless olive oil (couldn't even detect vinegar) dressing.  On your plate you had 2 cherry tomatoes cut in half, two pieces of arugula, and a single (not two or three) but a single sliver of onion.  The amount of iceberg lettuce was also very scant - interesting that with a mere handful of iceberg lettuce they managed to brown so much of it.  You can't have it both ways - claim to be a fancy steakhouse and then offer things unbecoming of a steakhouse.",

We were driving across the country towing a boat on our way to Newport, RI and decided to stop here early on a Monday evening. There was plenty of parking for our needs. I had the petit filet with caramelized onions, mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach. My husband had the $68 bone-in filet with French fries. Our daughter enjoyed another filet. All the steaks were served perfectly cooked to order on sizzling plates. They were flavorful and tender. The bartender poured a Cabernet Sauvignon instead of the Malbec that my husband and I had ordered, and when I sipped my glass, I realized it was a Cabernet and not a Malbec. I requested that our waiter ask the bartender to confirm it was poured from the correct bottle, and our waiter then brought me the correct glass of wine. (My husband liked the Cabernet, so he kept his. I returned mine.) There was a table near us with 4 people that seemed difficult to please and, while waiting for our waiter about the wine, we overheard our waiter patiently responding to their requests in a cheerful and professional manner. Halfway through our meal, the manager asked us if our waiter was taking care of us. I smiled and replied \"yes\"! (He was fantastic!) Dessert was good. At the end of our meal, our table was treated to a complimentary glass of champagne for each of us, with wishes for a continued safe journey, which more than made up for the error. Excellent gracious service. Excellent steaks. Excellent restaurant!",

The only complaint we had was the couple sitting next to us.  Lots of negativity coming from the lady...99% of it was not about the the restaurant. .  We thought about asking to move tables but the food was coming and we found used on that!  Great service from Trisha... we will be back.",

My filet was buttery and mouth watering with delightful flavor. We shares sides-- entrees are individual but sides to share family style--sweet potato casserole is divine with crumb pecan topping that is like dessert. Then shared asparagus grilled with hollandaise sauce, truly tasty. Robert Mondavi cabernet wine was perfect compliment and service was delightful!",

Our server Carol was knowledgeable, fun and great at giving suggestions and I promised her we would request her section next time we come in. The GM Chris was amazing! We talked with him forever about wine, which always makes me happy :)  Hubby and I shared the Cowboy Ribeye, the potatoes au gratin and the Brussels sprouts. To finish an amazing dinner we had the white chocolate bread pudding and I will never want a different dessert at this restaurant!!

The December special will remain a steadfast family staple. 2 lobster tails and a filet or Ribeye. Muah :*   Ashlynn was our server and we sat in the bar (expecting Happy Hour) but watched the tv.

    "text": "We had a great time here tonight. As it's Tuesday, it was nice that the restaurant wasn't packed with a weekend crowd. We got a res about an hour before arriving. Our party of 4 had: a bottle of Spanish red, the Caesar salad, the Wedge salad, the lobster bisque, the tbone, their fall specialty entree of bistro filet topped with crab, their fall specialty entree of filet medallions topped with scallops, the potatoes au gratin, the cauliflower au gratin, shoestring fries, cheesecake, and Ruth's coffee (spiked with Bailey's and other goodies). The steak entrees and their seafood accompaniments were superb. The cauliflower was delicious while the other sides (potatoes au gratin and fries) were just ok. I was disappointed by my wedge salad, but my friend said the Caesar was on point.  Our waiter was great, though he did disappear for long periods of time throughout the night. Not a big deal, as we had plenty of food and drink to occupy us and were enjoying catching up with friends. It's possible we were so caught up in our conversation he didn't want to pester or disturb us. Like I said, not exactly complaining, but it was something I noticed.  This was my second RCS visit, first at this location. I would definitely return.",

    "text": "Once again Restaurant Week gave us a winner here, but you really can't go wrong with such excellent selections,and superior service!   I went for the lettuce wedge salad, stuffed chicken breast and garlic mashed potatoes.  The lettuce wedge salad is one of my favorites here, it has bacon, bleu cheese crumbles and I chose the balsamic vingerette dressing. All of my favorites in one super yummy dish! Nothing is overwhelming on this dish,  all in ingredients work so well together and I loved every bite!  The stuffed chicken breast was so freaking good!!! It's an oven roasted double chicken breast stuffed with garlic herb cheese and served with lemon butter. Every bite of chicken is oozing with that heavenly garlic herb cheese! It's delicious...cooked to perfection, the chicken is so juicy... I want more now!   The garlic mashed potatoes were whipped and very good. All the sides are served family style so I suggest if you go with a group everyone should try something different because its more than enough to share!  Even though I was beyond stuffed, for the desert, they served mini cheesecakes with blueberries on top. It was delicious!   I left happy and full and it didn't damage my wallet too much! Awesome!",

My recommendation is that they are more constant with their drink prices. I ordered a rum straight up, single. I ordered it with only 2 rocks but they filled up my glass with ice. That's just about service. Where i was surprised was when i was charged $20 for a french martini. My single cost $10 and hers cost $20. Again, good food, experience, and service.  Even if you have money to spend, a $20 for a single vodka shot drink, is just shy of \"really?\".",

    "text": "Quote of the night \"its not the size the counts, its how rich it is\" in reference to their chocolate sin cake. So True, but I get ahead of myself.  First off, as you may have gathered, this place is expensive. Don't think that $50 gift card will go far. That's the lower end for an entree. For one. With no drinks. You have been warned.  We brazenly walked in to Ruth's on an unassuming Saturday night without reservations, taking the hostesses unawares with the aforementioned brazenness. No tables of course, but the bar is (always) available. We were seated within 2 minutes. 80% of the time, this strategy works 100% of the time.   Upon being seated, were with greeted with a handshake and introduction to the bar-staff (waaaa?) while not one, but two napkins and full flatware was laid out. An interesting beginning to the evening. Fantastic service, but I am just unaccustomed to shaking hands with a server (hope they wash their hands...)  The leather-bound menu looks as amazing as it was heavy. We both opted for the Classic menu selection, which includes a starter (soup or salad), entree, side, and dessert for between $40-$50 depending on the entree. Considering that many sole entrees start at $60, this was a pretty good deal. To got different starters and sides to maximize the experience.   *Tip for the Try-Frugal (you want to try it, but lack a trust fund): Come with a friend, get the Classic Menu Selection and split it. Unless you haven't eaten in a while, it'll suffice.  Starters: - The tortilla soup (an item I traditionally associate with Mexican restaurants) was much better than I had expected for a steakhouse. Well played!   - The arugula, mandarin & Prosciutto Salad, on the other hand, did not really do it for me. I think that I could buy all the ingredients ready-made (including the ubiquitous canned mandarins) from Costco and make it myself. I just expected more.  Winner: the tortilla soup  Sides: - Creamed Spinach: these came recommended and I can see why, it is about 50% cream. I am in no way complaining. If it is one thing that Ruth does well, its dairy. The bartender totally called this.   - Garlic Mashed Potatoes: A let down, particularly after seeing how glorious their baked potatoes looked. These are your grandma's garlic potatoes, maybe a little drier and light on the garlic. Although, it was brought to my attention that my lackluster reaction may be the result trying it after the rich creamed spinach. You can decide.  Winner: Baked potato (the one I briefly mentioned in passing). What can I say, I looked really, really good. Honorable mention to the creamed spinach.  Entree: - Stuffed Chicken Breast: Oh. My. God. I was so blind before, but THIS is what willis was talking about all along. Even our good friend the bartender said that this was the best item on the menu. It is a double chicken breast \"stuffed with garlic herb cheese and served with lemon butter\". Poking it causes volcanic eruptions of gooey cheese. I ate all of it. And I am not sorry. Seriously amazing!  - Filet: Honestly, I didn't care for it. A bit lacking in flavor and dry for me, although adding one of the compliments (cheese or pepper sauce) may alleviate this. Perhaps I just don't know how to appreciate a good steak? Who knows. I'd never do it again.  Clear winner: chicken breast!!!!  Dessert: Chocolate sin cake x2 (the only dessert available on the value menu) - One is enough for two, as it is a flour-less chocolate cake (i.e., fudge). You need to smother it in cream in order to stuff it down your gullet; otherwise the richness can cause you to choke. Though, my favorite part though was the witty remark from our new bff the bartender in response to an inquiry on the size of the dessert: \"size doesn't matter the counts, its how rich it is\". Truly, it was your bartendery wisdom that left me satiated me that evening.     *Actually not our bff. I was merely trying to describe the growing feelings of affection towards the bartender--which all started with a handshake.  TIP2: shake hands with your wait staff (just be sure to be aware of and obey any local laws which may run contrary to this tip)",

From the beginning we had a great experience, our server James who was one of the best servers we've ever had allowed us time to get settled in and grabbed us water. When he returned we decided we wanted to buy a bottle of wine, ky wife not being a big wine drinker was not sure what she wanted james walked us through and let us taste several different wines before landing on a great bottle, never once did we feel rushed or likw an inconvience. Once dinner came we ordered, we both had steaks i had the filet with blue cheese and we had a side of brussel sprouts. The whole meal was delicious, during dinner the manager came and introduced himself, he was very polite. Later he came back noticing we did not have a starch and brought us a mashed potato, it was very nice. After our meal, james told us they wanted to treat us to dessert for our ann. They let us pick 2 of any dessert we wanted, and covered it. At the end when we asked for the bill, it was getting late and we had to pick up the kids, james brought us our bill, boxes, and had the valet pull the car up. This was by far one of the best overall restaurant experiences i have ever had the entire staff was great, and they made us feel truly special. It made the lone dinner we will have by ourselves memorable and we really appreciate it.",

We all had the 6 oz tenderloin filet and each added a compliment to our steaks--scallops, shrimp and the creole crab. We all liked the salads, the entrees and the sides. If you want to switch out a side off the fixed menu, you can but there is a up charge. Not a huge deal. The sides are smaller than normal but still enough to share. One steak had to be sent back because they didn't prepare as requested due to allergies to the butter. Dessert was chocolate bark and mini cheesecake. Everyone commented how good the food was and that it was just the right size. Service was attentive and spot on.  I have always thought Ruth Chris had the better steak of all the higher end steakhouses---tonight didn't disappoint. They were well prepared for Charlotte Restaurant Week. I go several times a year to various Ruth Chris locations and have found them to always be consistent.",

    "text": "I decided to eat unhealthy tonight, That is correct, you heard me UNHEALTHY. Where could I find an unhealthy meal? This should not be to hard I have many choices. Ah! a steakhouse is a good start.   I knew I was off to a great start when I walked into the bar area to sit at a high table for two and I began breathing in a stream of second hand smoke. I looked over towards the bar to see who was assisting in my quest for an unhealthy meal. It was coming from a couple with matching bowling shirts at the end of the bar. She was blowing smoke like a broken radiator hose in a Mack truck. I am thinking this meal is going beyond unhealthy, it might kill me.   The service was slow even though the place was not crowded. I ordered a glass of Chateau Ste. Michelle, Indian Reserve Cabernet.  They actually poured a full 6 ounces in my glass.  My server finally showed up after a long wait and I ordered the large fillet and mushroom sides, knowing it would be prepared in lots of unhealthy butter. That is a Ruth Chris signature on steak preparation. Marinade it lots of butter and then pour more butter on top right before you serve it on an extremely hot plate. I was well on my way to having an unhealthy meal.   The steak arrived on the white plate heated to ??? degrees. The steak was standing in a pool of butter and additional butter was jumping off the edges of the plate due to the sizzling effect. The large mushrooms were glistening from the butter coating and almost floating in the butter. Man, I am really living on the edge!   The server warned me of the hot plate heated to ??? degrees and placed it 3\" from me on the table. I could feel the intense heat from the plate and I stared in amazement as the 200+ degree sizzling butter splattered onto my $125 shirt. I am now thinking not only will I eat unhealthy but I can trash one of my favorite shirts at the same time.   I started in on the mushrooms and sure enough they tasted buttery. I liked the mushrooms, very tasty. The steak was cooked medium (pink in the center) and had a odd shape for a fillet. The steak tasted very average and actually had a few tough spots which is unusual for a center cut fillet.   I finished up and felt that I had accomplished my goal of eating an unhealthy meal. I was all buttered up inside and out, thanks to the server putting the plate of spattering butter right next to me. My lungs were full of second hand smoke and I was on a red meat overdose.   This is just another corporate steakhouse environment. Hit or miss on the food quality and not in the same league as the Ruth Chris in Annapolis, Md. As I write this review I am soaking the shirt I wore the other night to Ruth Chris in Wisk laundry detergent in an attempt to get the butter stain out. I might write a review about Wisk.",

The manager Mr. K. Pace came by our table and introduced himself.  He was very helpful in evey way.  I applaud this steakhouse for it's service, leadership and most of all the delicious steaks....  I highly reccomend this restaurant.  S. Cooper",

    "text": "For my birthday this year my wonderful husband took me to Ruth's Chris for dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived at 7pm for our reservation. But soon started filling up with a few couples and several tables of business men. it went from fairly quiet to noisey just as quickly.  I would've taken pictures inside but the lighting was so dim, although perfect for a nice romantic dinner setting, was less than ideal for my Iphone camera. We started off with a couple cocktails awaited our stuffed mushroom appetizer and enjoyed conversation. Our waiter was informative and very pleasant. (M Miles?) Our stuffed mushrooms arrive and it is 4 fairly good sized mushrooms over stuffed with a very nice crab stuffing, topped with butter melting in the dish. Wonderful flavors blended in not over seasoned and could have used a little more cheese on top and maybe its just me but I thought a squeeze of lemon would have set it over the top! Yum  next we had our dinner, my husband had the ribeye and I choose the petite filet with shrimp. sides we choose were the asparagus with hollandaise and potatoes au gratin which is enough for 2 people to share so becareful on ordering sides plenty of sharing family style opportunites. The asparagus were perfectly aldente and the hollandaise is none like I have ever had it was the consistency of a mayonnaise with a pleasant flavor. and it complimented the asparagus well.  my 2 small filets melted in my mouth and each was topped with 3 nice sized shrimp each. this is a great alternative and less expensive than buying the filet and adding $12 for the 6 shrimp!  i tasted my husbands ribeye and it was very tasty but in my opinion could've been more tender.  now the au gratin potatoes we did not care for. there was a strange taste of cheese we could not put our finger on. very strong pungent cheese that left an after taste in our mouths. upon asking the waiter what was in it he returned to say the odd cheese was some kind of italian cheese (dont remeber the name) and he and the manager Kevin said they would take it off our bill, but hence it did not disappear so that was $8 thrown in the trash! we ordered the creme brulee which is out of this world! I personally dont like custard like desserts but I will eat this any time! our waiter also brought us on the house a trio of desserts, it was the chocolate sin cake, rasberry sorbet and a mini cheesecake. my husband melted into the cheesecake savoring every bite. the sorbet was glorious and the chocolate sin cake, well my first bit all I could say is WOW. that is pure chocolate, eating more than a couple bites will send you into a sugar shock! if you love dark chocolate this is the dish for you! I highly recommend sharing that sin! I did love combining a small bite of the cake along with the sorbet, it balanced out the strong cake very well.   I would love to eat here often but the cost is the downfall for that. 2 of us spent $155 without tip. 2 jack and coke $18.50 2 crown and coke $20.50 mushrooms $12 petite filet and shrimp $39.00 ribeye $40 asparagus $9 potatoes $8 creme brulee $8  a wonderful meal for a wonderful end to my day!",

Yes it is a bit expensive but well worth the money in my opinion with the quality of the steak cuts, service and the deserts take it over the top.  The management here is always available in the dining room and make it a point to come by at least once during your meal to make sure that you are pleased with the service and meal. I cant say enough about this place, it is a great place for taking that special someone to spend that little extra on to show them how much you love and appreciate them.",

The service was great and our server did a great job, however the food was mediocre at best. The bread was hard and crispy, the Caesar salad had so much dressing that it was overwhelming with a more than usual super strong anchovie taste, the petite filet was actually very good and well prepared, however my husband did not enjoy his ribeye at all and kept comparing it to Del Frisco's across the street. The garlic mashed potatoes were very creamy and rich tasting, but we did not like the green beans at all. Overall this was a very mediocre dinning experience with an unusual crowd and not a place we will be returning to.",

The sweet potato casserole and green beans were great!! I had the filet and my boyfriend had the NY Strip. Both were really good although we both agreed mine was better :-)  The chocolate cake was okay but not as good as some people said it was.  In the future I think I'll come and try an appetizer and skip the dessert!! That being said I will definitely be coming back!! The food and service was above reproach and I was very happy that it lived up to all the raving I had heard about it even though it is a chain restaurant!!",

    "text": "Time for an update.  My husband and I always go to Ruth Chris for our birthdays in October, except for two other times, once to take out the in-laws and once this past weekend when my aunt took us out to dinner - who will say no to great steak!  This time was no different than our usual order.  We each always get the ribeye.  For sides, we used to get the broccoli au gratin and the mushrooms.  We did not see the broccoli au gratin on the menu this time, so we went back to an old favorite, the potatoes au gratin along with mushrooms, and just plain broccoli.  The potatoes au gratin are good, but the broccoli was just better.  Maybe next time they can make that for us?  The mushrooms are fabulous, they changed their recipe though, they used to use big mushrooms, now they are small cut up, probably easier for sharing, but they are still great!    We ended with cheesecake, which was large enough for the three of us to share.  Good cheesecake, but being a cheesecake lover, I have to say not the best that I've had or nothing to make me go wow!  Still liked it enough to keep eating it :)  Food was great this time, but service was awful.  We had Michael wait on us, will try to get someone with personality and someone who cares to have a customer next time.  As much as I deduct places for bad service, I can't do it with Ruth Chris as we have had wonderful service with other people other times.  Can't let one bad egg this time ruin it.  We will be back in October, not to be served by Michael!",

You're seated quickly, (even though I always make reservations) and effectively placed in the right spot. Food service is the ult. I normally start with a fine red and order the exact same thing every time. Don't get me wrong, I've tried other things and it's all great. But the filet is literally to die for. The medium rare meat melts in your mouth like butter. The mashed potatoes are delicious. The crab cakes are yummy. The house salad is tasty. The deserts are even good. I've had the ribeye.. it's great... sirloin.. awesome. In fact it's All amazing. I could live in a Ruth Chris and be happy. I even got engaged at my Ruth Chris and the staff made it one of the greatest nights of my life! If you want amazing service, delicious food and ambiance in an exclusive package ..

The steak is served on a 500 degree plate with a rich butter sauce. They cook it in a 1000+ degree oven that makes it melt like butter when you knife into it and then place it on your tongue... it's just so good.

Outstanding service and the food and drinks were impeccable. Not one thing was wrong with my food. The taste, the temperature, everything was perfect! They give you decent size portions, and I was definitely surprised because it was restaurant week. Our server was outstanding and I'm so upset I cannot remember his name. I had two 4 oz steak medallions and my boyfriend had the stuffed chicken (which he absolutely loved). We shared the green beans and mashed potatoes because it was served separately and it was enough for two. We also had raspberry and strawberry cocktails which were made VERY well. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of our drinks. I would like to come again during happy hour because the drinks were made so well. I highly recommend this location near South Park mall and I will DEFINITELY return. The only negative comment I can share is that we asked for our desserts to go and never received them. However, everything else was so perfect that not getting our desserts was no big deal at all.",

    "text": "I've dined at Ruth's Chris 100's of times over the years & this particular location has really disappointed the last few visits. During my previous visit, they inadvertently threw away my steak when boxing the leftovers & we waited 20 minutes for them to make a new medium-rare petite filet. I asked for nothing, since mistakes happen & thought that I would at least receive another steak for the inconvenience. When I arrived at home, I noticed they just cut off a small piece of another steak, which was smaller than what they tossed. I brushed it off & my husband & I came back for our anniversary. The waiter asked if we were there for a special occasion (which was indicated when booking) & then wished us a Happy Anniversary. We generally notice that there is no consistency when it comes to special occasions here. Sometimes, you receive a complimentary dessert of your choice, other times they prepare a complimentary dessert of their choice, or you receive nothing. My husband had shrimp & it was quite good, I had my usual petite filet medium-rare, which came out as medium & covered in excessive amounts of pepper. I used my mashed potatoes to help cancel the excessive pepper. When we received our bill, we noticed the dessert was not listed, so we figured it was complimentary & we were using our OpenTable MasterCard credit & this time, had gift cards as well. We paid & when the manager returned, he placed the check holder down, indicated we had a balance & took off. I knew this was not right, since the gift cards & $10 MasterCard credit covered the total along with additional funds towards the tip. When I opened the check holder for the 2nd time, the manager actually added the dessert onto the check & didn't use the OpenTable credit, rather he selected a $10 comp for Birthday/Anniversary for the dessert & kept the OpenTable MasterCard credit. Considering we were there for our Anniversary we were insulted. When a waiter drops a check, no additional items should be added. Had he come back & said, I'm sorry, I forgot to add something to the bill, then we would have understood & addressed the issue. I firmly believe that had we paid completely by credit card, they would not have added our anniversary dessert onto the check. We waited 10 minutes & the server never returned to our table. To Management, if you don't appreciate OpenTable or gift cards, don't participate in the programs. We won't be back.",

Waiter said nothing about the specials and gave us a few minutes to order. Had the Caesar salad, shrimp and garlic mashed and spinach. Although Caesar salad was ok, it was made from the \"white / lite green\" lettuce with pieces of Parmesan cheese rather than hand ground. The shrimp was good but the garlic mashed was too wet and made dealing with the shrimp difficult. Spinach was a good portion but although I asked for sauteed was served creamed with baked cheese on top. Waiter never said our drinks were not included in the bar specials and took 2 requests to get some bread. For the price charged I expected better.",

The other medallion was medium rare.  I ordered an 11oz filet cooked medium rare.  The very middle was medium, but most of the steak was medium well to well done.  The flavor was great, just disappointed with the cooking.  For the price, should be cooked right!",

    "text": "Ruth's Chris at South Park is one of my favorites, however our last visit was below their usually high standards. I made a reservation for our anniversary in December. The hostess when I made the reservation asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and I told her it was our anniversary.  We arrived on time and were greeted and seated promptly.  The restaurant was not very busy, but we waited for a while before our waiter came to take our order.  After ordering,  we waited an inordinate amount of time before the food was delivered.  After dinner, we ordered coffee and a dessert to share. We again waited a long time before the dessert was delivered.  The server indicated our dessert order had been delivered to another table.  No one acknowledged our anniversary and we were disappointed. We have previously been comped a dessert or champagne - this year - nothing!  The food was great and we will come back, but the service was less than we have come to expect",

    "text": "The good: tasty Brussels sprouts, lovely cowboy ribeye, and a truly exquisite bone-in New York Strip.  The bad: all things considered, the service was lacking, both in terms of promptness and as a source of advice throughout the food-selection and wine-pairing process.  The ugly: the thick black hairs we found in the au gratin potatoes.  Overall verdict: while the service disappointed and the restaurant could have done more from a cleanliness perspective, the food more than made up for these disappointing aspects of our visit.  We came to Ruth's Chris on a Friday night. We'd made a reservation some time before and we're quickly seated. The waiter greeted and offered us a choice of water promptly; the water came shortly thereafter. I cannot say the same about the wine. I asked for a sample of wine; after about 15 minutes, nothing had happened. I asked the water for the sample--yet again, nothing. On my third try, I finally got my wine--after a 20-minute or so wait.  I also found the ordering process to be disappointing. The waiter seemed to lack firm opinions on any aspect of the menu other than dessert; there's nothing I find more disappointing at this stage in the dining process than a yes-man, so to speak.  We ultimately settled in the bone-in cowboy ribeye (medium rare plus) and bone-in New York strip (medium). We also accepted a recommendation from the waiter (I've got to hand it to him--this was a good call) to have both steaks seared for a few seconds--doing so really augmented the rich taste of the marbling in both steaks.  The ribeye was good, but the strip was truly a blast. With the ribeye, I found much of the flavor to center around the marbling. I guess that, in and of itself, is not unusual. With the strip, however, I found that both meat and marbling were bursting with juicy flavor. I've also sworn by ribeye, but I'm definitely going for the strip the next time I come by here.  We ordered the Brussels sprouts and au gratin potatoes as sides. The former were quite good if slightly greasy; I would, nonetheless, recommend them. The latter was extraordinarily cheesy, although the potatoes were surprisingly flavorful. We only got to try one of the potatoes before we found several large hairs inside the dish--at least they took this order off of our bill.  We didn't order dessert, although the waiter very strongly recommended the bread pudding (again, something to try at a later date.  All in all, I found the waiter to not be particularly attentive. He was kind enough to take a few pictures of us, which somewhat ameliorated my impression of him, but I'd say I saw him six or seven times over the course of more than two hours. Despite this, the meal was wonderful and is enough of a draw in its own right to bring me back.",

The manager apologizes after I tell her that we have been waiting for almost an hour for our food and our waiter has NOT came to check In on us since he took the order, he would look at our table and keep moving. She apologized and said our food will be out soon, that's when the waiter decided a to come and do his job and tell us the same thing the manager said. After waiting another 10-15 minutes, we left, and no one came to apologize about the inconvenience and unprofessionalism of this establishment. I believe it was because we were the ONLY MINORITIES at the time, because we clearly seen other customers that were of Caucasian decent receive their food before we left. Working in the food industry myself, this place was one of the most unprofessional, unorganized, unapologetic, unorthodox and HIGHLY unsatisfactory we have been to. I am in awe from my experience with this company on how they allow this establishment stay open. We will be contacting corporate in regards of our experience.",

    "text": "I rarely every write reviews during Charlotte Restaurant Week. However, our experience at Ruth's Chris last weekend was so stellar that a review was definitely warranted!  So Charlotte Restaurant week at Ruth Chris= soup or salad, steak/chicken/fish, side, dessert for $35. What a deal! This is obviously not the normal price.  We arrived and got seated. We had brought in our own wine (pro tip- no corking fee at this location!) and the somm immediately asked us if he could decant it. Yes, please!   Food: I got the mushroom soup, 8 oz filet mignon, mashed potatoes, and the dessert for the evening (cheesecake with dark chocolate bark). My hubby got the wedge salad, 8 oz filet mignon, mushrooms, and dessert. The soup was ok but the salad was fantastic. They got the good good ranch (everyone knows those places that have the GOOD ranch). Our steaks were cooked perfectly!! Medium rare, like all good steaks should be cooked! Sometimes for Restaurant Week I feel that places give a little smaller or lower quality cuts. However, these steaks were spot on and loaded with sizzling butter! The two sides were good but the steaks were the star. I was so full by dessert that I packaged mine up. However, the chocolate bark was a nice addition to the dessert. Not as filling but still gave you that satisfying sweetness.   Service: Service was absolutely fantastic. The pace of the evening was perfect for my husband and I to enjoy our bottle of wine and food slowly. Our waiter actually recognized us from a visit over a year ago...thats good!   Overall fantastic evening, delicious food and wine, and even better company!",

I got a rare steak (and barely that), and some kind of cold , congealed shoestring potato monstrosity.   Horrible. Wasted money. I am cooking my steak now, and have learned a lesson.   Never again.",

    "text": "I don't normally write reviews based on restaurant week experiences, but the one my wife and I just had at this Ruth's Chris location was enjoyable enough that I had to chime in. To start off, the deal here for restaurant week was unreal. Start off with a soup or salad, get a main entree and side, and finish with a dessert combo for $35. Also this location does not charge a corking fee so bringing your own wine rounds out an amazing steal for the meal and experience!  We started out slow with one of the drink managers come by (I think his name was Dan) who was really charming and got us a decanter for our wine. This is not the first time we had been to this location, and later on in the evening when the waiter came over we jumped to the same realization that he had actually served us before! I was impressed as we had not been here in over a year. Definitely some top notch service and staff at this location!  On to the food. The ranch dressing here is the bomb. Mine came on a pretty stellar wedge salad, however I'm pretty sure it makes anything edible. I ended up ordering the filet mignon (8 oz) medium rare and it came out cooked spot on. I realize they use copious amounts of butter on these steaks, but the flavor and presentation with the very hot plate is tough to beat. I got the mushrooms as a side that were good, but not the star attraction. Then there was a dessert of cheesecake and dark chocolate bark which was a great way to end the meal.   Our overall dining experience took more than an hour and a half, but did not feel rushed at all. I think the wait staff checked in at the appropriate intervals and the length was partly due to us starting slow with our own bottle of wine. It was exactly what we were looking for - something where we didn't feel rushed and could enjoy the overall experience. With some top notch steakhouse competition in Charlotte, I'm glad to say this is one of the better places you can choose!",

    "text": "I came here for restaurant week. I am not a big steak person so I opted for the stuffed chicken breast and spinach. The chicken breast is something special, definitely something to write home and tell everyone about. But the first thing I noticed was the smell of the carpet in the main dining room, not good when you are trying to eat. I tasted my nieces mashed potatoes and they were super bland, definitely didn't expect that from a steakhouse. I wasn't really impressed but I will say that I enjoyed my meal. The free valet was a plus. Will this make my list of go to restaurants no, but I would certainly go back for the chicken breast.",

For salads, I had the wedge with the lemon basil dressing. It was pretty good. My fiance had the Ceaser and it was great.  For dinner he had the twin lobster tails and I got the ribeye. For sides we had brussel sprouts and potatoes au gratin. My steak was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. His tails were overdone, enough to send back. We don't generally do that but it was pretty tough. The brussel sprouts were ok, I usually expect roasted sprouts to have some color and browning, these were pale and uninspiring.  The potatoes were good. When the tails came back out they were great. But by that time I was done.  So we didn't really get to enjoy the meal together.  It was just disappointing. At this price point I expect everything to be too notch.  The service by the staff in the bar area was top notch, no issues there.",

The wine, abeyance , presentation, staff and even our table mates were FANTASTIC! A++ job!  The 1st and 2nd course were amazing- honestly I was very surprised how much we enjoyed the falafel & roasted pumpkin!  However the 3rd and 4th courses were not what we have come to expect from Ruth Chris- anywhere but especially in South Park. The Braised Short ribs in form of a meatball were bland and disappointing. But the most disappointing was the fatty filet that was served raw. While I like my steak medium rare my boyfriend likes his rare- and ours was just raw. We both took ours to go and cooked them at home.    I have dined at Ruth Chris all over the country and am very proud of the South Park location and believe it to be the best- I write this review not to complain or put down the establishment but just to raise a red flag to the Ruth Chris Team that the dinner was subpar at best and certainly not what we have come to expect from the Ruth Chris South Park.   I had written to the sales and marketing manager who responded it was a corporate driven menu and someone would be in touch with me- the dinner was over a month ago and no one reached out and I have yet to receive the bottle of wine we purchased.",

Then our reservation came up and the Greeters @ the door came to get us and these young ladies are very professional and very welcoming, they took us to our seat where the team of Lexine and Diante took care of  our every need and brought us awesome food and the wife had the Queens Feast Petite Sirloin and I had the Kings Feast with 11oz Filet. We always have a pleasant meal here and this was no exception. When we eat here we never feel rushed to change out tables faster, like we did a competitors place in Uptown. We love Restaurant Week but we come here when it is not and will continue to until the standard drops and hopefully that will never come. Keep up the good work RC.",

    "text": "The kitchen is amazing as you would expect but the bartenders are lost with a capital \"what's-lost-start-with-again\"?   I'm at the hotel next door and my take out order-14oz NY strip, baked potato and asparagus were cold because they were sitting beneath the bar for 15 minutes as I sat waiting for the bartenders to retrieve it from the kitchen. To be fair, they possibly have never had a take out order before and might not be permitted in the kitchen.   But when I asked (since I was going to be waiting a while) \"Hey, what is bottle between the Herradura and 1942?\", they were befuddled and stared at the wall of bottles like puppies to whom someone was whistling off key. The manager overheard and said \"Creyente, it's a super smooth mezcal\".   So a couple minutes later, when it was apparent I would be there for a while, I told one of the bartenders I'd like Creyente, neat. He said \"So do you want it on the rocks?\" \"No, just neat\" I replied, gesturing whatever means no ice just pour it into a rocks glass. I corner-eyed him making sure he didn't grab a shaker and salt.   Eventually, I discerned my food was actually sitting below the bar the entire time, having been delivered to them before I ever even walked in the door 15 minutes earlier.   Sure enough, the receipt had my name on it so they gave me my cold steak, potato and asparagus and I walked back to the Marriott where it tasted like it would've been amazing if it hadn't sat next to an ice box for 20 minutes. Kinda like those 70's movie stars on Cozi.   Oh, by the way, they totally forgot my pecan cheesecake and I'm not walking back 100 yards to ask for it. I bet it tastes really, rehheallllly good with hot espresso. Also, I still tipped 20% because that's on me.   Anyway, long story short, Creyente is a really smooth Mezcal and the bartenders need more training. Also, you should try Creyente neat--So smoky and smooth like my lady.",

I received an email confirming the reservation.    The menu had everything you could want.  We had an excellent waiter who spent the time explaining the menu and answering our questions.  He gave us recommendations that were perfect.  Caesar salads to start.   The main course - Filet and Ribeye were the two cuts of meat along with lobster tails ordered.  The steaks come out on 500-degree plates....they are still sizzling.  The sides were outstanding.  You have to order the sweet potato casserole.  It is wonderful....it could be a dessert!  Lobster mac and cheese was quite good as well.    Mini cheesecake and a scoop of vanilla ice cream ended our meal.  The waiter then brought out the best raspberry sorbet for my son as we were there to celebrate his graduation.    If you have never been to Ruth's Chris, you must experience it.  While on the pricey side it was worth it as I got an excellent meal and time spent with my boys.",

We came here for Charlotte Restaurant Week, and since I never tried Ruth Chris before, this was the perfect time to go. You got three courses for $35: salad or soup, entree with one side, and dessert. The menu was a select amount of items, but you still had a good amount of variety to choose from. You could even add on to your meal for an additional price as well. The steak (tender 8 ounce filet), shrimp (seasoned jumbo shrimp), and garlic mashed potatoes were pretty good that I had. The desert was ok; I would not order the cheesecake again if I was there. Customer service was extraordinary though. They made up for what was lacking in the food. The waiter even brought out a complimentary spinach dish with our food which was nice. Im glad I got to experience it whole these courses are only 35!",

    "text": "Dined at the South Park location Ruth's Chris for Restaurant Week 2019 (January). I had reservations and my party were seated immediately (win).   We were offered the RW menu, along with the regular menu. The RW menu offered a salad to start, an entree, choice side and dessert. The entree options included steak (of course), salmon and stuffed chicken. My party of 3, ordered all three options. I had the stuffed chicken, which is usually very delicious and has melted gooey cheese stuffing oozing out. This time however, only some of the cheese was melted and closer to the center, it wasn't melted at all (so cold cheese, boo). Also, it didn't seem like the actual was seasoned well.  My friend who ordered the steak, said that she enjoyed it and my other friend said her salmon was severely under-seasoned.   We each got a side with our entree and also ordered the sweet potato casserole (which was not on the RW menu). We had creamed spinach, green beans & mashed potatoes. The casserole is a favorite if ours and was very good. The other sides were average, nothing over the top  We all took our desserts to go and mine was not eaten by me but I was told it was good, lol.  The service was good and prompt and the restaurant has a very nice ambiance. However, the food this time wasn't what you would expect from such a popular steakhouse. I usually go to the Uptown location for lunch and it's always pretty good. This was more of a 2.5 star for me and since that's not an option, I gave it 3 stars.",

My spouse and I arrived early for our reserved time, and we were seated immediately.  I found this surprising since we arrived at prime time on a Friday night.  We were seated right next to the door.  I was hoping for something more intimate, but nothing was available when I asked to be moved.  In addition, the opening and closing of the door made us cold.  Our servers were fantastic and the server's helper had a fun attitude.  He made jokes that made us laugh and it showed that he loves his job and interacting with people.  The service and food was what I would expect from an upscale restaurant.  No complaints there.  My one complaint is that the server did not ask what we were celebrating, like she and the other staff members were doing.  Near the end of the service I mentioned we were celebrating an anniversary and she didn't react.  She didn't say congratulations or acknowledged what I said in any way and I felt dismissed.  The couple seated next to us had their dessert delivered with the words \"happy anniversary\" on it.  Not us.  I will definitely come back in the future when I want to enjoy a romantic, relaxing meal.  I just hope things go a bit better or I won't be back again.",

    "text": "Charlotte agenda mentioned a deal where you could get a $83 gift card for $53.  We had purchased that because I had never been to Ruth Chris.  My husband made reservations for my  birthday which seems like a great time to use the gift card.    We were running a little late but we're still seated immediately.    Our server was incredible.  We had bread and waters in no time.  As a special treat for my birthday they brought out champagne  for a toast.  This was a nice touch.  We ordered the blueberry mojito with vodka.  It was sooooooo delicious and refreshing.  I ended up ordering another one.  We split a salad, the New York strip, and shoestring fries.  Everything was really good but I would get something different than the strip next time it was a little rich for me.  My husband love it though.  For dessert they brought out a little cheesecake and chocolate it was so nice.    There is a happy hour menu if you sit at the bar and Ruth Chris publishes all of their nutrition.",

We were then welcomed by the General Manager who was kind enough to bring complementary champagne for a birthday toast!  This was fabulous customer service. We then ordered stuffed crab mushrooms for an appetizer. We each had the Peppercorn Petite Filet (medium plus) and split a salad and baked potato. One of the best steaks I've ever had!   Birthday celebration was completed with a wonderful creme brulee. Totally recommend! Tony was our server and he did a wonderful job. The entire staff was very attentive and paced the meal well. Enjoyable experience and great birthday celebration! Will be back - hopefully before the next birthday",

The menu looked  great an we could eat an get out on time in the bar for our movie.  I cant say enough our wonderful servers we had. We ordered the zucchini fries they were crispy just perfect great sauce a little kick. We both ordered the roasted artisan chicken sandwich. They had me at Brie , marinated chicken breast so moist cooked perfect. Brie cheese with curry peach compote served with a fresh berry salad yum . Add the hot warm bread with butter Amazing the brie an peach compote made the sandwich perfect . My friend ordered their creme brulee I ordered  the warm apple tart. That was the best apple tart I have ever had. Let me another waiter who was also working the bar Timothy he was great.   We saw 2 men get this hugggge cowboy ribeye 22oz they come to your table an cut it for you an its served on a very warm place he swirled it on the plates with butter.

Less than excellent were side dishes of scalloped potatoes and Brussels sprouts.",

The menu features two price fix dinner's $50  and$60.  These are 3 course dinners , dessert included otherwise everything was ala cart. Menu is  very pricey in all respects. 2 of us ordered the menu price fix choices and 3 of us ordered ala cart . Bread and butter on the table. We also ordered an appetizer for the table.  Two of us ordered the rib eye steak which was just amazing, well seasoned and tender . One of us ordered the salmon filet which was delicious another  of us ordered the 3 lamb chops which were good and a kids menu  meal , a filet of beef with french fries . We had a seafood appetizer for the table that actually really fed 3 of us.  It was presented beautifully and the seafood was very fresh and tasty.  We also had salads,  a wedge salad, romaine salad, and a steakhouse salad plus sides of roasted brussel sprouts, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.  The wedge salad was nothing spectacular, just a lonely wedge of lettuce on the plate , bits of bacon, microscopic blue cheese crumbles and a side of blue cheese dressing. I've had better wedge salads elsewhere and thought this was quite pricey. The brussel sprouts were good , a little bit firm for our tastes. Creamed spinach very tasty as well as the mashed potatoes. The desserts of apple bread pudding, chocolate pudding, wedge of nutty chocolate and cheesecake delicious. The bread pudding had a lit candle. We were also presented with gratis glasses of champagne to celebrate our special occasions.   The steakhouse salad was good, the seafood appetizer was excellent, everything very fresh and tasty. So basically foods were plated nicely, hot foods came out hot and steaks sizzling hot. Portion size adequate. Service and attention excellent. Our menu explained by our waiter. Overall a great experience for our special occasions.",

She anticipated our needs and was spot on with all aspects of our meal.

I can't say enough about the staff, the top notch service and of course our Cowboy Ribeyes were phenomenal!!!

James goes by Jim was excellent in his service to our table, very pleasant and informative.  Not overbearing or to talkative.  We never had to wait on drink refills or anything for that matter.  Restaurant was busy but not packed.    T-bone steak I ordered was a tad over cooked, I hated to even say anything, but as I only come once or twice a year I wanted it perfect.  It was handled perfectly, another steak was put in to cook in the process of manager making it to the table to apologize.  The next steak was perfect exactly as ordered.  My wife had the cowboy ribeye and it was cooked to perfection as well.   We ordered the Brussel sprouts with bacon, potatoes au gratin, sweet potato souffle for sides.  All were excellent.   2 deserts were comped by the manager, we boxed to take home and I am sure will be just as great.    5 stars, even though first steak was not perfect, the way it was handled was.    My wife had a great time, enjoyed a terrific meal and outing.    Thank you for being great at what you do, from management down to Maya who prepared our leftovers to take home.   She was just as pleasant and gave us new ideas for desert.   Awesome experience.",

Durning my visit staff were attentive and friendly. They made recommendations and were knowledgeable.   The food-It was fresh and tasted great. We ordered a variety of apps. The calamari which which had a sweet and spicy drizzle that paired well with it. The crab stack was served cold and mixed with fresh avocado in between it was served with a super spicy sauce. It wasn't my favorite but I appreciate the presentation and creative aspect to try something different. The blue crab cakes were yummy. They were nice and hot when we got them and tasted so good. You didn't even need the sauces it paired with. The stuffed mushrooms came in a set of three they were delicious.   The bathrooms were spacious and clean.   The drinks- I tried the coconut ginger lemon martini. This drink has a kick. I couldn't taste the coconut it was drowned out by the dominant flavors of the lemon and ginger. It will wake you up. The strawberry basil was my favorite. I will come back again just for that. It was refreshing. The rosemary cosmo was good as well.   They have valet and a full parking lot behind the restaurant. Parking lot is currently free.   I hope this helps.",

    "text": "Can you say disappointment?? That would summarize my review of Ruth's Chris Southpark. Why am I so specific, well, because I've been to other locations and as a result, expect MUCH better.  This is restaurant week in Charlotte, and YES, restaurants are busy. We booked in to this location for my wifes birthday because she LOVED the downtown location when we did this last year (also during restaurant week). Let me just say, when we went to the downtown location last year, it was one of the best dining experiences EVER!!  Southpark location, not so much! :( It started out with a 45 minutes wait at the door. We had an 8:15 reservation, but waited until nearly 9:00pm before being seated. The plus... the hostess gave us all a glass of champagne. The minus... there really wasn't a good place to wait! When we finally did get seated, it continued to go downhill. Our server (Jon/John?) was not terribly attentive. (Something we did NOT experience downtown!) We seldom saw him and when waiting for him... we really waited! My wife ordered a glass of wine. We were well into the first course before she received it. Oh and did I mention that the salad dressing my wife received for my salad was wrong! And since it took so long for our server to appear (about the time the wine arrived), the rest of the party was halfway through their appetizers! When we told the waiter, no appology... just off he went and got her the correct salad dressing.  So, on to the main course. FIRST ... NONE of the steaks came in the famous Ruth's Chris 1800 degree sizzling manner! In fact my steak (More on this in a minute) looked like it had been sitting for some time. Now, I had a wonderful Filet Mignon.. the problem with that was, I ORDERED  a NY strip! I had thought about sending it back, but based on how our experience to this point, I certainly was NOT going to take the time wait for another steak while my party waited!!!!  My wife at the petite Filet. Overdone. She ordered a medium. It came VERY well done. Her comment, which to me was priceless... \"I could have gotten this at Western Sizzlin!\" Now, I'm not a Western Sizzlin hater, but somehow I just expected better fro Ruth's Chris!   Do you want to hear MORE??  When the bus boy came, he spilt corn on my wifes gift and our guests jacket as he cleared the table.  And as I sit here composing this, drinking my lovely hot coffee, I think back to the almost warm coffee I was served last night.  To sum it up... disappointment! I KNOW they can do better, but they totally failed last night!  Next year... maybe we'll try downtown again... or move to Del Frisco, Morton, Palm ...SOMEBODY must want our business!",

Personally I think valet parking is stupid unless the lot is miles away.  We started with a bottle of Shiraz- it was very good.  I had the surf and turf special and my coworker had the petite filet.  I ordered mine medium and it came out rare- not cool.  After coming back from the kitchen the meal was good and hopefully spit free.  We had the broccoli and mashed potatoes as sides.  The broccoli wasn't done enough and very hard to cut through with any grace.  The service was alright until I arrived in the parking lot.  As I'm handing the lot attendant a tip, he says to me \"hey you might want to turn your music back on, i got bored listening to it because it was country and switched it to howard stern\".  If the place wasn't so expensive I would have given it two stars.  I'm not going back.",

What I didn't get:  Don't have any regrets coming to Ruth's Chris!  Waiter was awesome, funny and is getting married in June and we just might get an invite.  Great place..and will def do this one again.    They offered four different items under the King's Feast entree section that was $10 more.  Loved it but glad I didn't get it.

I love Jeffrey, he is a great waiter and wine steward and the service and ambiance in this location is just a bit better than some of the other Steak Houses in the area. There is a very homey feel about the dining room.. you feel almost warm and enclosed as opposed to larger dining rooms that make you feel exposed. My fave item is the Sweet Potato Casserole as a side.   They were so sweet, we had a special dinner occassion and they actually special ordered the Cabernet Sauvignon Inniskillin Ice Winethat was too rare to find on a restaurant menu.. THAT kind of service is why you pay these prices..",

Ruths, in my opinion, has gone way downhill in quality over the years.  For $43 my steak better be off the charts great.  It wasn't.  Both the fliet and ribeye were mediocre at best.  Salad was bland.  The calimari, in a Thai chili sauce, was quite nice though.   Doubt I'll be back to any Ruths anytime soon, unless a wealthy benefactor is footing the bill.  $150 for two steaks, an app, a salad, one potato au gratin (very dissapointing) and two glasses of wine.  Plenty of other high end places at the same or less of a price point wtih better meat.  Again, just one person's opinion but I do eat at steak places worldwide on a regular basis.",

He laughed with us and made our conversations comfortable. Every recommendation of a dish or wine we asked for he had GREAT descriptions of each one right off the spot.

    "text": "My husband and I were introduced to this Ruth Chris location due to a Networking Event for The Grays foundation ( A husband and wife duo who does great things in the community in Charlotte). We are new to Charlotte and had never traveled that far up Fairview pass Whole Foods and the Mall so there were other places we discovered back in that section of South Park as well that we can not wait to experience. We are NOT NEW to Ruth Chris by far, I'm from Chicago and my husband New York City so we've been there and done that. What made this Ruth Chris special and stand out was the exceptional service, professionalism and attentiveness of the wait staff, the manager and the hostess. The event we attended also made me LOVE this Ruth Chris even more because there was a high percentage of professional african americans and the staff didn't change the way they should treat customers AT ALL and I've found this to be the case at a lot of South Park restaurants we've eaten in (e.g. Maggiano's). The fact that no one on the staff were rude, or lacked attentiveness and professionalism made me want to give this Ruth Chris more business in the near future. I had the BBQ Shrimp appetizer as my meal ( I wasn't very hungry because there was FREE food catered by Ruth Chris for the event that I nibbled on earlier) and my husband had the Stuff Chicken. My husband LOVED his stuff chicken and I made mention to Nate (our AMAZING waiter) that my shrimp was cold which I believed stemmed from them waiting to bring my shrimp out while my husband stuff chicken cooked (which takes 30plus minutes). I informed him that I was okay eating the shrimp because I didn't want to wait for another batch and eat to late in the evening. Nate was persistent to get me HOT shrimp, so along with the check he brought out HOT shrimp in a to go container and presented it to me and said \"Your lunch for tomorrow\". This was very nice and I appreciated, I indeed added the shrimp to a salad and ate it the next day for lunch. I didn't get the manager name, however he was VERY nice and came over to check on us twice. He even joked about me taking pictures and I let him know that I was about to Yelp our meal and he said \"Carry-On and I hope you LOVE IT\"..",

    "text": "My first visit to the oft mentioned Ruth's Chris for lunch this weekend was a great experience, from the easy to find location to the sampling of the brunch/lunch menu on a Sunday afternoon.  Our server, Brandon, was excellent!  He made suggestions, checked with the kitchen on a couple of special requests made by our table and our glasses never even thought about getting empty!  The restaurant is nicely decorated and of course would make a great backdrop for any special occasion...we were celebrating 3 birthdays and an anniversary all at once at our table!  Our table of six ordered Shrimp and Grits, Stuffed Chicken Breast, Jumbo Shrimp Chop Salad, Salmon, a New York Strip, and a Steakburger.  I sampled all but the salmon and burger and they were delish, the steak was almost fork tender and seasoned perfectly!!  I ordered the stuffed chicken breast that came filled to overflowing with a yummy cheesy buttery goodness inside on top of mashed potataoes and aspargus - it was all very good!  We shared the sides of sweet potato casserole, mashed potatoes and asparagus and each was prepared perfectly.  Around us we saw some wonderful brunch dishes being brought out and I would love to return for a visit to sample some of that selection of waffles, omelets and maybe even steak and eggs!  For dessert we shared Creme Brulee, Key Lime Pie, Cheesecake and a Chocolate Sin Cake.  The creme brulee was good, not the best I've ever had, as was the key lime pie, nothing super spectacular and the same could be said for the cheesecake.  Now the Chocoloate Sin Cake? Fellow yelpers - I've found the richest most chocolately thing I've ever put in my mouth! Seriously - it warrants a trip back just for this cake, I promise!  I have a yelper friend in mind that simply MUST check it out!  Sure Ruth's Chris is known for steak, but the variety we had this trip shows that there is more to be found than just beef!  Did I mention the Chocolate Sin Cake? Oh? I did? Trust me....you need to try it!  I would have given the restaurant a 4.5 out of 5 if I could have, the half point being deducted for the other 'okay' desserts and the not overwhelmingly yummy entrees, but the WOW factor of the cake and the very good sample of steak I had made me round up!  Go. Eat. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Another wow'd performance at Ruth's Chris.  After a gorgeous and extroverted bartender poured me a delicious beer, we sat down for our meal, where the remarkable service began.  The first indication of world-class service happened before we even sat down.  Our hostess immediately picked up our white napkins and replaced them with black ones, knowing that we had on darker clothing and did not wish to take the little fuzzes with us - exactly what should have happened, but often doesn't.  After ordering the wine, I'm having a quiet conversation with the Mrs. and I make a comment to her that I felt a draft - the air conditioner was blowing on my head and I could feel it.  Not strongly enough to make a fuss, I just noticed it and said something to my wife.  Not three minutes later, the waiter at the next table over visits us and explains that he has turned off the A/C so it would stop blowing on my head - outstanding!    The incredible service was amplified with our top-flight waiter who was there when we needed him and left us alone when we didn't.    At one point I asked him, \"If we don't finish this bottle of wine, can we recork it and take it with us?\" \"Absolutely,\" he replied, \"we even have a special, sealable bag that goes on top.  Would you like for me to decant the wine?\" \"Well, I would prefer to decant it, but if you do, I won't be able to take it home if we don't finish it,\" I say quasi-dissapointedly.   \"Not a problem, sir, I would be happy to pour whatever you don't finish in the decanter back into the bottle, seal it, and send you on your way.\"  Take notes other restaurants out there (Morton's, DelFrisco's, Flemings) - This is how you wow customers.  The stuffed mushrooms were very good, but truth be told, I prefer more \"chunky\" crab meat in them as opposed to the crab meaty paste.  Our steaks were delicious, as per usual, really are top notch on quality, food temperature, preparation, and taste.  Our garlic mash was great, but our asparagus was a bit blah.  I know they're not exactly in season at the moment and I have to have some knock, right?  Overall the food was excellent.    A terrific dining experience accompanied by beautiful company and an extensive wine list creates a perfect recipe for a satisfied customer - we will be back!",

We consider ourselves foodies and knew what we wanted to order. It wasn't our first eating out experience. We were just passing through Charlotte and decided we wanted to have a good steak dinner and relax. We knew Ruth Chris would not disappoint; however the waiter was relentless in his sales pitch. To the point of asking if we valet parked at the end. We knew we were in for a less than fine dining experience when coming from the bar(bartender was awesome, he made great quality drinks and was fun) , dropping 70 dollars on drinks, when we told the waiter we wanted only water to begin with as we were just at the bar. When he came back to check on us to take our food order he said he was glad we were enjoying our tap water. Sorry Charlie, we won't be stopping in that Ruth Chris Charlotte South Park again and if we do we will eat at the bar.",

    "text": "Yes, tonight was a special occasion, and what a special night it was.  This is our first visit to this location, and after reading the reviews on Yelp, we had to give it a try.  To top it off, we were confident that this would be the right place to spend this occasion, and let me tell you we were not disappointed.  For starters, I used Yelp, to place the reservations online via the open table reservations.  It was simple and since I prepared two weeks in advance the time slot was readily available.  Upon arriving at the restaurant, they offer courtesy valet parking, a private parking lot, and a parking garage for your convenience. The hostess met us at the door, she was very friendly, and took our names for the reservation.  We were very promptly seated, our drinks were promptly filled with water, and bread and butter was provided at that time. Our server was at our table just after the water finished flowing and was very informative regarding the menu.  I would have provided pictures as I normally do, however, I did feel somewhat uncomfortable trying to take photos during this special night, and opted to just write a review instead.  My wife's meal consisted of the Petite Filet, and Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  I had the Ribeye with the BBQ Crab Steak Topping which had a very buttery yet skampi-ish type flavor. It had a very nice flavor and the crab was awesome.    We skipped the desert , and headed to the Cheesecake Factory across the street, but let me tell you that the deserts that passed by our table looked very good.  This meal had all of the essentials of an great meal. Great service, great food, and while I may have splurged tonight, it was definitely placed on our to be back lists, regardless of the occasion.  I am stingy with my stars, but this was a solid 5 star experience.  NCFoodGuy",

I'll be honest, when I looked at the online menu last week, I thought we're not going to get much, I hope they give us a lot of bread so I won't be hungry when I leave. Boy was I wrong. He made a 6:30 reservation for Saturday. They open at 5. We were seated immediately. Our great, very handsome waiter Kenneth immediately came over. He asked if we had ever been. We hadn't. He told us how the steaks are cooked, he gave us some suggestions. Best of all, he \"paid\" for our sweet potatoe casserole since he knew we would love it. That's an understatement. I had the bistro steak with horseradish dressing. My cousin had bistro steak with shrimp. They came with choice of sides. We had salad, creamed spinach and crab rice and the casserole Everything was delicious!  Plus the dessert of apple turnover with ice cream came with it. We were way too full to eat. I took them home. I wish I could say I'll be back soon, but as the old 80's R&B song goes..\"ain't nothing going on but the rent.\"  (Look it up, Gwen Guthrie). I'll be back one day.

    "text": "Let me start by first saying this place is a 5 star restaurant. I rarely give 5 stars because I'm such a hard critic but this place deserves it. The only reason I took a star off is because one of the waiters, Chris, accidentally backed into another waiter carrying an entire platter of plates and wine glasses and she dropped it right beside my table. No big deal right? Accidents happen, BUT apparently a piece of glass landed in my Moms chair and when she was about to get up to use the restroom it CUT her and yes she was bleeding. Of course it was a complete accident and when I got the bill he removed her steak from the bill, but I feel her entire meal and sides should've been free.   Now on to the actual food review, I have been to a lot of steak places in my life, and before hand id say Flemings had the best steak I've ever tasted in Charlotte, but not anymore. I ordered the ribeye and let me tell you, it was cooked PERFECTLY. I eat all my steaks well done and the ribeye literally made u want to throw the entire thing, still sizzling from the oven, into your mouth lol. Lawd, I can't say enough about it, very flavorful. Now the sides were also very good. PLEASE NOTE, the sides are large, and are big enough for definitely 2, maybe even 3 people if you're not greedy like me, so you really should share with whoever you come with to save money. The sweet potato casserole was also the BEST I've ever had in my life, and I mean Anywhere! The corn, was very good also, the broccoli was nothing special (but then again when is it ever? Lol).  It wasn't mushy and not too hard, it was perfect.   Now to the \"bad\", I tasted my sister crab cakes she ordered and those were VERY mushy. I mean I almost felt like I was eating baby food. If they could've been a bit crispier or broiled longer they would've been much better.   Also, I wish I didn't have to remind the waiters to refill our water, because our cups were about empty before I pulled someone to the side, but hey maybe Chris was busy? The food is very expensive though so it's best for special occasions. Overall this is a 5 star restaurant, just wish I could've changed a few things at the end.",

    "text": "My sister and I went here for restaurant week last Tuesday. We had reservations at 8:15 but didn't get seated until around 8:30 pm.   When we sat down, our server Chris introduced himself and was very welcoming. He thanked us for our patience with the wait and said we could order an appetizer on him/Ruth Chris. We were thrilled because we were planning on ordering one anyways. He made a great selection on the red house blend and I'm not a huge red wine drinker! But that was very good.   Our food was amazing and our water glasses hardly ever saw the bottom of the glass. Everyone was wonderful. The restaurant week menu came with a duo dessert: banana bread pudding and cheesecake. My sister and I are not big fans of either and only had one bite of each. Chris noticed and asked how they were. I told him I'm wasn't a huge fan of either and I told him I felt VERY bad telling him that. He offered me ice cream but I told him it was really okay and it wasn't a big deal. He went to go put something away and came back to say he doesn't want us going home disappointed with the dessert so he will provide us a chocolate dessert duo. Another positive point for Chris. When he came back, I told I was in Heaven and I could cry. Their chocolate molten cake is to die for!!!!   There were a group of men who had been drinking at the bar and during our dessert, they got pretty loud. One of the employees (don't want to name his job title incorrectly) had said, \"I want to apologize for that. That's extremely uncalled for.\" My sister and I laughed and said it was no big deal. We just laughed at the guys.  We made reservations in September to come back!",

    "text": "GEW.  Just another overrated and overpriced chain steakhouse (not to say all chain steakhouses are bad; Del Frisco's is decidedly not bad).  I will go through all the things I tried and why each, minus the desserts, sucked:  - BREAD: step up your bread game, RC.  This was some of the worst restaurant bread I've ever had.  It was like a warmed up Harris Teeter \"french roll.\" Bland, dry... so unsatisfactory.  - HARVEST SALAD: fine, this didn't suck, per se. it was just fine, but c'mon, it's a salad.  - OSSO BUCCO RAVIOLI: ordered as an appetizer. did not like. the tastes in this dish did not go well with each other.  - LAMB CHOPS: medium rare with mint jelly. frowny face. basically hunks of lamb fat served with mint jelly from a jar. I know, I know, who gets lamb at a steakhouse -- whatever, I just wanted to try them.  Lesson learned.  And I guess for the price, I thought they would at least have a mint chutney or something... not the mint version of canned cranberry sauce.  - NEW YORK STRIP: medium (sigh). Despite being medium, this was the best of the three meat dishes.  It was fine.  - RIBEYE: medium rare. I don't even know what wasn't good about it.  It just didn't taste good nor did I enjoy the texture.  BLT's ribeye puts this one to shame.  - LOADED BAKED POTATO: seriously, RC... w.t.f. My potato was undercooked so instead of being soft and flaky, it was hard and chunky. like bread, a baked potato should be a gimme... yet, RC didn't do either right.  - CREAMED SPINACH: so so so bland.  - MASHED POTATOES: so so so mediocre.  - ONION RINGS: fine.   - APPLE TART: delicious.   - CHEESECAKE: so delicious.  - SERVICE: server was average. bussers were surly as hell. food runners were confused. literally took about 20 mins. for us to get our check and pay. nothing annoys me more than being ready to leave and the server won't take my money.  I wish I could use my words better to explain why the steaks were not good... alas, what I said above will have to suffice.  If you want a good steak, go to BLT or Del Frisco's.  Don't come here. Don't go to Fleming's, either.  It's worse than RC.",

Its my wife's birthday and its restaurant week, so why not get a great meal for a good price. Wrong answer...   It appears they serve cheaper grades of meat for restaurant week hoping the rubes wont know the difference. We both ordered the rib-eyes on the Kings Feast, both our steaks were not so tender and not so juicy. We both agreed they were cheaper cuts of meat and could have gotten better steaks at an Outback. Also, the mushrooms weren't cooked long enough and the cheese cake deserts were dry.  The whole meal was second rate, all the way around disappointing, not what I expect from RC. I thought the whole point of restaurant week was to show case what the restaurant has to offer at a reasonable price, hoping you will come back another day. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe its just turned into a money grab. Oh well, $240 down the shitter... Wont be doing that again...  I would say this to RC... If you are not going to bring your A Game for Restaurant Week, then don't participate, all you are doing is tarnishing your reputation and disappointing potential customers.",

I got the filet with twin lobster tails ($47.95) and it was succulent but the broccoli was extremely plain with no flavor at all ($8).  The presentation of the chopped salad was exquisite, unlike any I've seen - not in a bowl but created in some sort of round cylinder to create a perfectly stacked look ($9).  Although dinner was memorable I think the majority of the menu is grossly overpriced and the broccoli needed flavor and flair.  In my opinion I can't see paying $150 for 2 salads, 2 entrees and 2 side items (no dessert!) when my meals are just as tasty at Longhorn or Outback without all the foo foo.  A nice treat when someone else is paying because I'm much too conservative!",

    "text": "THIS Should have been posted for the uptown location on south tryon street..my apologys.. This place most def deserves five stars..even tho there is one closer to me on Greenville..I wanted to surprise the lady for once..so I made a reservation for their private wine cellar for two..all I can say is it was stunning..all the way to the cellar she kept asking where we were going? Why did we past the kitchen? But once we reached the door she was in tears..speechless..if you ever want to impress your female fellas..I suggest the private cellar..you are far enough not to hear anything and you can even close the door if you like.. Now for the service and food..the server should be commended..same with the maitre d/ sommelier.. I told these guys this date had to be special..and they went above and beyond..far from being overbearing..they kept a wonderful pace throughout the meal..to make us feel as if we were in control..I ordered the Moet Chandon bottle..will opt for the Moet Rose next time..we had the porterhouse for two..and I asked the waiter if I could request to the chef if he could sear the steak in the broiler and cook it the rest of the way in the oven..request granted..it came out sizzling on a hot plate..tasted more like butter than the butter melted on the top..I also ordered the lobster tail..was good..just a little too spicy with the Cajun seasoning they put on top..almost gave it a salty spicy taste..but it was cooked perfectly..the waiter suggested the lobster Mac and cheese..but baby doll isn't big on seafood so we opted for the mashed potatoes..broccoli and sweet potatoes..all the sides were excellent too.. I begin to have cramps in my hands in the middle of our meal ( always something to try to mess up a great thing) but our server was very accomadating with that too..when we asked if we could box the rest of our stuff up to go..within a minute  someone was putting it in boxes for us..i think he felt so bad for me because she basically had to feed me..he gave us a dessert to go..just wanted to say thank you to the waiter, maitre d and chef for providing a experience that will long be remembered..made regulars outta us..she asked me five times on the way home..how you ever gonna beat that? Posted pics of the wine cellar and the food so you can check it out for yourself.. With food comparable to the Capitol grille and Flemings and mortons..the cellar is that special touch that puts them two steps ahead of the competitors..keep it up ..and thank you for a wonderful experience again.. Sorry for the mishap!!",
