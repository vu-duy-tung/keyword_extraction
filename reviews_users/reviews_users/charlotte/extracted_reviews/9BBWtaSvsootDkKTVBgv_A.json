They had a wide variety of food, including a sushi bar and hibachi grill. The sushi bar had about 6 different types of rolls(may have more at dinner) and I always like a make your own hibachi. I wish there would've been more protein options on the hibachi bar, but that's the only negative I have. Add in the fact that it's under $9, and it's a great option for lunch!",

As I walked away, I heard some laughing but didn't think anything of it. When we left, my co-worker stated the female stated \"I bet he makes his way to the watermelon!\" As an educated, professional black male, I found this offensive and degrading.  I have tried to hold it, but every time I see the co-worker...it makes me angry he thought it was funny and condoned the comment. I am at a point now, where I wonder what other comments or actions are being taken against folks her! The staff here needs some cultural diversity, because I guess she forgot she is a minority too!",

I did try the hot wings and grilled chicken both were great. Nice and clean but of course new in the area. Not that excited been to way better Chinese restaurants than this. Enjoy",

My main problem was that the food was waaaaay too salty, so much so that after dining there Mother Day, my feet and hands were still quite swollen two days later, and I drank tons of water to clear all that MSG from my body.  So while the food was okay, the sushi not bad and the fruit bar quite nice, I can't weather all that sodium which disappoints since it's in my Steele Creek neighborhood.  Other folks might enjoy it, especially families.",

The place looked great and we were seated quickly. And that's about all the positive I have- the food had the same texture  (NOT good), flavors were NOT tasty and I will not be returning. Even the hibachi food was overcooked because the food was rushed. There were a couple of inedible bites from the buffet that just made me want to run. I can just as easily spend more money for great Chinese/Asian food instead of throwing away food and money. Not impressed.",

The first one was that I really don't care for picking up silverware with the rest of the buffet items. (Just my pet peeve) But the other was that our waitress literally abandoned us after we were sat down LITERALLY!!! And the other waiter and waitresses didn't not know if we were being helped or not. I will try to come back and use my discount for the free beverage I got for checking in. Lol",

    "text": "There are quite a few large buffets in the area, one being Passion Grill in Gastonia and another is China King Super Buffet on Tyvola, and this one is right up there with them. I would say as far as size and variety go, It's 2nd to Passion but beats China King.   They have a separate sushi bar and a hibachi grill to go along with the standard buffet items. The dessert, fruit, salad areas are also heavy with options compared to your typical buffet. There is plenty of room to aimlessly roam around looking at the options and due to the size, I've hardly ever had to wait for people to get out of my way, which would suck if you're really hungry. When hungry and confronted with more food than one could ever hope to eat, I often contemplate the morality of pushing little kids out of the way when they are clumsily trying to tong noodles onto their plates. Luckily, I don't have worry about it here.  They have the hard-to-find beef with broccoli (for my dad) as well as the common chicken with broccoli. They have various white fish and grilled salmon (grilled in a white sauce). They have a spinach with cheese dish that I've never seen. It's really good.  There is obviously much more, including two different types of rice. There are a few \"American\" dishes such as pizza  and some kind of meat as well as other stuff I haven't paid a lot of attention to.   The food itself is actually tasty. It's not something to blow you away but they keep it full and fresh and depending on your personal tastes, it's rather good, especially now compared to when they first opened. I thought everything was overcooked when they first opened, however, as time has gone by for them to settle, I have been here many times and it's definitely much better.   The staff is moderately friendly (quiet but nice) and are efficient. They always have someone taking your empty plate or filling your drink without much wait and you can tell they are constantly scanning the GIGANTIC dining area to make sure we're all happy.   The price, in my opinion, is just about right. It's around the same as China King but offers much more. It's a few dollars less expensive than Passion Grill, but offers a little less.   With all this positive, why not five stars instead of four? Well, I suppose it's simply because the food taste isn't the most impressive. As I mentioned, there are good dishes, and it's not at all bad, but nothing to get excited about. I would say it was normal with some hits and some misses, but hey, it's all subjective anyway.   Since I'm a fan and this place is near me, it will be a go-to place to eat for those days when I don't feel like spending too much energy on figuring out what \"I'm in the mood for\" or when not feeling up to figuring out a new place to try.   One tip... remember to grab your silverware at the buffet tables with your plate or you'll have to get up again. I don't know how many times this has happened to me and my company.",

The food quality, selection & service is not superior to any other buffet I've ever been to... It is just average and basic. So the price of $10.99 is the only redeeming factor here! but honestly I would much rather go to Amber buffet in Rock Hill on Tuesday when their special price is also $10.99 and the food has flavor and I don't have to PAY before I eat. or even Tin Tin in pineville which has CRAB legs and authentic soups. and if its the sushi you're excited about, just go to Ru San's for the all you can eat sushi lunch buffet for $11.99!",

The soup smelled too bad for me to even want to taste it, the sushi was so nasty I had to literally spit it out into my napkin, the fried shrimp tasted good but halfway through my second piece I realized they didn't bother cleaning the shrimp & left the digestive tract in the shrimp- gross! The only thing that was consistent between my two visits was the fact that the host tried to tell us we didn't a high chair for my 10 month old, suggesting we just keep him in his baby carrier and put him in the seat- what?! It was the same nonsense both times, annoying to say the least. We're about an hour removed from eating there & both my husband and I are sipping ginger ale trying to get rid of our upset stomachs.

Some of the food didn't always look fresh, but that's no different than I've seen at any other buffet as the food sits out.   Their seafood selection includes mussels, crab, lobster, octopus etc. They have a substantial salad bar. I love their sushi selection which includes tempura, nagiri, and Rainbow Rolls.   For me, this is one of the most affordable buffets around with the highest quality. They also usually have coupons. The restaurant is also HUGE, so you never have to worry about waiting for a seat.

I tried the usual stuff, some fried items, stir fried dishes, a few seafood items; all of which were sub par at best. Some food seemed like it had been sitting under the heat lamps for too long. My fiance had gotten some stuff he couldn't even finish because he thought it was so bad.

    "text": "What a smorgasbord!  The place has it all - Chinese buffet, sushi, made to order hibachi, even roast beef!   The best part about this establishment is the made to odder hibachi. They have several veggie and meat options to build your own stir fry, four sauces, and they cook it in front of you. The shrimp on mine were cooked perfectly and the chef added the right amount of chili flakes to give the dish a nice spice level.   The sushi bar had a surprising amount of choice and complexity. They went above the standard tuna, salmon and California rolls to include rainbow rolls, several fried rolls, and my favorite which was spicy tuna topped with tuna.   The Chinese buffet was pretty good as well. I loved the seafood alfredo dish they had as well as the chicken and broccoli. The food was a little greasy but that is par for the course at this type of buffet. The soups were okay with the hot and sour being much better than the wonton.  They have an American section that has nuggets and pizza which I didn't sample. I did try the roast beef which was good but not great.   I also liked that you pay before you eat, and all the prices are clearly listed. Everything was upfront and had a reasonably priced $12 dinner buffet price. I will definitely return to try out more of their selection.",

    "text": "All Chinese buffets have one thing in common- there are some things that are good, and some things that are not so good. The same goes for Jasmine Buffet.   The decor and atmosphere is not spectacular- the room is arranged to maximize diner efficiency. The food is arranged by categories on about 8-10 islands, each displaying anywhere from 8-16 dishes. The dining area surrounds this central food area. Diners enter the food area, select their choices, then return to their table to eat. Since it is all you can eat, you can go back as many times as you'd like.   The food quality was spotty. The highlights were the pepper chicken, BBQ beef/chicken, and the beef and broccoli. The misses included the cheese mussels, the rib tips, and the spare ribs.   The sushi was, overall, disappointing. You could tell that some of the sushi had seen better days and had obviously been prepared some time ago.   The dessert selection was limited. The availability of ice cream scooped from buckets was nice- better than the soft serve ice cream machines at some buffets.   If you are hungry and are careful in your food selections, then Jasmine Buffet is the place for you. If you are looking for a memorable dining experience, there are probably better choices.",

That could be found in the claws had shriveled up to the point it wasn't worth the effort it takes to crack the claw open. And the legs on the small crabs were the size of straws, so i knew there wasn't any point of trying to get get meat from them.  So, i saw they had crab meat being served separately. I got myself a helping of that only to find out it was that cheap, pasty, rubbery imitation crab meat that can only fool anyone that's never had real crab meat before. ENOUGH. I give it ONE star only because I can't leave zero star reviews.",

You build you own from a selection of veggies, meat and seafood. Most of the food was fresh and nothing tasted as it sat out for hours. They also have a dessert bar with various treats and 8 different ice creams.   Overall for $10.99 ( at dinner) it's a great deal, however this was a one time is enough for me.

This buffet was clean and they had a good amount of selections, however it was just your run of the mill Chinese buffet. The food was just ok, not bad but nothing to write home about and it was a little on the expensive side. My hubs and I paid close to $40 for the two of us to eat the buffet. The food wasn't worth the price in my opinion.",

It's hot and ready to eat. They have good options for people that do not like Chinese food as well. I would say it's about half an half with the food options. The sushi and hibachi are also good. The desert bar has some good options too.   I always find something good to eat here and always leave with a full stomach, but my last visit was probably the weakest of all of my trips there. If you want some quick food and you plan on eating a lot of food, I would recommend it for sure. More so for lunch since it has reduced pricing during the week.",

The place itself was very clean and organized and the staff were very attentive and made sure everyone had what they needed. The buffet is pretty big! They had hibachi, sushi, classic Chinese foods, \"kid\" foods (pizza, fries, chicken nuggets, etc.), a salad bar, a dessert bar, and an ice cream bar! I filled my plate with a variety of foods and then I had my dessert. For dessert I had a mini mousse dessert, a mini strawberry cake, and a mini chocolate cake. Everything was superb and not bad quality at all. If you decide to stop by the ice cream bar you'll see very odd flavors such as Red Bean and Green Tea! Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone who likes Asian buffets!",

The restaurant is clean and the tables are well-managed by the wait staff who quickly refill drinks and clear dirty plates. The steam tables are unchanged. The kitchen staff keep them clean and stocked, clearing off the stuff that people didn't quite manage to get onto their plates. An item dropped on the floor was cleaned up swiftly.  But the food itself seems to be lacking. There's a lot more western food here including mac & cheese, chicken tenders and pizza and stuff for the kids, and there's a lot less Chinese. Really only six or so dishes with a protein in them and two were \"& broccoli.\" Too much fried and too many heavy sauces.  The sushi is fresh and updated, but it wasn't the right kind of rice. The texture of the nigiri was too tight, too dry and unflavored.  The hit here is probably still the hibachi grill but that's not my thing.",

Their egg drop soup was actually very good. It had great flavor where as many times when I've ordered egg drop soup it taste like they cooked it with water rather than broth.   At the time I was there, around 1ish, the sushi was fresh, which was surprising for a buffet. Keep in mind that I was there during the busy lunch time. Normally I stay far away from sushi at a buffet.   I would recommend this restaurant. Foods not bad and the service my friends and I received was friendly and attentive. I can't really complain about anything. Will definitely go there for lunch again.",

The variety in food is ridiculous. There were several tables for asian style food, one table for american style food, one table for fried foods, a raw bar of oysters and mussles, a salad bar, a pudding bar, an ice cream bar, and a dessert bar.   I was pleasantly suprised by the amount of fish offered, the salmon and whitefish were quite good. There were however very few fully vegetarian dishes, I think the only thing they had was a green beans dish. The hibachi looked very popular but I did not try it. The sushi bar was pretty sad and I didn't really trust the fish. I definitely did not trust the raw bar, the oysters looked very slimy.   The desserts were ok, the ice cream was pretty good.  Overall the food is not the best, I would say subpar to your regular old chinese takeout, but for the price and the variety this is definitely a very good deal and there's plenty of seating.",

There were big chunks of tendon in the beef w/ broccoli, there was too much oil on the green beans, etc.  I don't know why they couldn't just put a decent Chinese menu on the buffer.

We were watched from the minute we arrived until the minute we left. We were brought our check and we weren't even close to finishing, we didn't say anything and kept eating. When done we were getting ready to walk to the front and pay and the waitress/owner stopped us and told us she would take our payment. We asked why if everyone was paying up front and she said it doesn't matter but I'll take the check for you. That made no sense at all. We can told her we were paying up front like everyone else and she stood behind us making sure we paid and then left. This is not a way to treat customers who make your business prosper by eating here. We will never be back again. These people are racist against African Americans and Hispanics.",

    "text": "I was instantly impressed when I walked through the doors and saw that the place wasn't as shady as it seems on the outside.  It is large and spacious.   And even still, we went on a Saturday afternoon, and saw it get very busy (but there was still more than enough space).  It seemed pretty clean, decent price.  However, the quality of the food is so underwhelming that the sheer quantity of the food did not improve my experience.   The chicken was greasier than normal, and the flavor just wasn't there - it was like something was missing from all of the dishes we tried (and we tried just about everything!)  The sushi was ok... wasn't a 5 star but it seemed decently put together, and more enjoyable for me than the regular food (altbough in all honesty, I can eat sushi just about anywhere and be fine).  They had a typical dessert bar with ice cream (that all the kids present insisted that theyd get to scoop! Lol).  So, all in all, nothing too fancy.  If the taste was better they would have received more stars from me.",

    "text": "I have to write about this place - the price alone is worth it! the sushi and the hibachi grill is the best things there worth going, the buffet selections are just okay.  I think of it this way where can you get all you can eat sushi for around 9 lunch and 11 for dinner. Plus fruit, desserts and ice cream.  Like I said go for the price, keep coming back for the all you can eat sushi.(The sushi temp is always cold)",
