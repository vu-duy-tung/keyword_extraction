The service was exceptional and always there when we needed it.  My business partner had the Trout and his looked very good as well.  We both had a coffee before we left and it was all pretty good.",

I highly doubt you could go to this restaurant and not be satisfied. The staff is very attentive and kind, the atmosphere is incredibly relaxed, and the building itself is gorgeous. Don't miss out on a great new addition to Charlotte! Will be returning :)",

We had to wait about 30 minutes at 6:45pm on a Saturday (we didn't have reservations) and then were able to get two seats at the pizza bar.  BEST seats in the house!  The pizza bar faces a wide open kitchen where you can watch all the action.  It was just my husband and I so this was fun for us.  The head chef was right in front of us the entire time and we got to see all of the beautiful food come out before we had to make our own choices.  The Chef chatted with us throughout the meal and made some fabulous recommendations.  I love the vibe of this place, the food was fantastic and being able to watch them lovingly and painstakingly prepare the dishes added to our enjoyment.  Waitstaff was great and knows the menu well.    Amazing dishes: Porchetta, truffle angel hair pasta (on special), tuna carpaccio, even the caesar salad was special with lovely anchovies on top.    Cannot wait to go back!",

I tried to make a reservation several evenings only to repeatedly have my call go directly to a voice message saying that due to heavy business they do not answer their phone in the evenings and only take reservations between 2-6pm.   If they're that busy, you would think they could hire someone to answer the phone in the evening hours. I even went as far as calling Barringtons, one of the \"sister\" restaurants and had no luck there either.   When I did call back the next day, the young lady that answered the phone sounded annoyed by my phone call.   I asked for a reservation a week away only to be rudely told we're all booked.   Not even....is there another night you might want to come....can I put you on a wait list....nothing welcoming or accommodating on her part.    For a restaurant group with the reputation that they have in town, you would think their front of house staff would be better trained.   I hope their good publicity has not gone to their heads.",

    "text": "This was one of the best meals I have had in Charlotte in a long time. I started off with the Arancini and it was really good. Wish it would have had a little more cheese, but it was still very good. Then had the Farfalle for my entree. It was made to perfection. The pasta, shrimp, and broth it was served in was amazing. It was a light pasta dish that didn't leave me feeling overwhelmed after eating it. Then for dessert I had the cannoli and it was served with pistachio ice cream. That was delicious as well.   Just a few suggestions:  1) wish the cocktail list had a few more choices 2) the wine list needs some details about the wines so customers can make a better choice. I love trying new wines, but stuck to the pinot grigio as I didn't know what any of the others were or what they may be like. 3) we had a reservation, but did not get seated until 20+ mins after that reservation time.   4) light fixture in the bathroom looks super cheap compared to the overall restaurant. Noticed the lights seem to be from Target and are usually found outside over a patio with a plug on the end to use for the next strand.   All-in-all, I highly suggest trying this place. The food was amazing and the restaurant, outside and in, is beautiful.",

    "text": "Disappointing at best. First bad sign was the bread. They serve their bread in a brown paper bag. It was cold and not fresh. Next was the PEI appetizer that was the next bad sign - the sauce really lacked in flavor. That was on the precursor to the main course. I went with the baked rigatoni with boar meat and mozzarella cheese. Sounded great but it was hardly that. Again, absolutely no flavor and the noodles were certainly not homemade. In my opinion, if you're going to charge $24 for a small portion of pasta it better be pretty darn good, or at the least be full of flavor. Never in my life had I had to consider putting salt on my pasta. I've had better pasta at Olive Garden and spent half the amount. Service was pretty slow, especially considering we went early and the place wasn't crowded. We will be taking are money elsewhere in the future and our search for authentic Italian continues. If you truly enjoy authentic Italian food, avoid this place like the plague.",

We made a 7:30 reservation and were promptly seated when we arrived a few minutes early. They have prosecco on tap and a large Italian wine list. Unfortunately, that's all we got to enjoy for quite a while, as it took 45 minutes to place our dinner order. We ordered 2 appetizers, a pizza to share, and two pasta dishes. The mussels appetizer never arrived, and we got to watch the kitchen staff clean the kitchen as we finally got our entrees. By this time we were so aggravated and exhausted that we completely skipped dessert, and to add insult to injury it still took another 15 minutes to get the check sorted (including removing the charge for the missing appetizer.) Our server was very friendly and pretty knowledgeable about the menu, but seemed to have half the tables in the restaurant in his section, and almost all of those tables were seated within about 10-15 minutes of us. Unfortunately I don't think we'll be making a return trip any time soon.",

They denied our reservation, and the hostess was extremely rude. Another friend that was with us said a similar thing happened to her a few weeks earlier when she tried to go with a group of 5 for another bday party.  This type of behavior is completely unacceptable especially for a restaurant/restaurant group of this caliber. If you don't want to take reservations, then fine, but it's poor business to allow patrons to plan a night to fail at your expense.  If you do mess up a reservation, then try to accommodate the customer rather than treating them like they are at fault.  Needless to say, none of my friends will ever be trying this restaurant.  There are too many good restaurants with good customer service to deal with this treatment.",

    "text": "I was so excited when Stagioni opened because I live right around the corner and was hoping it could become a new go-to in the neighborhood.  Maybe I was there on a bad night, but there were so many things wrong with our meal.  First off, the service was terrible.  Our waiter wasn't knowledgeable about the menu or the bar, and seemed disinclined to answer basic questions or do anything (including refilling our water glasses) to take care of our party of four.  It took forever to get drinks and longer to get our food.  At one point when we were attempting to order our food, our waiter literally turned away and began talking with someone from the kitchen as we all sat and watched. When the food did arrive, the plates were dropped in front of us. I ended up with my friend's cauliflower pizza and a Peewee Herman-sized pair of scissors to cut the pizza. Not only was it extremely gimmicky and silly, it was also awkward watching her cut a pizza with a pair of giant kitchen scissors.  Our meals were all extremely salty and mediocre at best. Luckily, our waiter had left a carafe of water at the table so we could refill our glasses ourselves.  We were repeatedly interrupted mid-conversation by bus staff and our waiter, suddenly all anxious to move us along with our meal.  They removed our plates before we had swallowed our last bites. Still optimistic, we ordered dessert which arrived almost immediately.  Just as we began to eat the gelato that was melting on the hot plate it came out, the open concept kitchen, which we were seated adjacent to, began breaking down.  Within minutes, cleaning chemicals began wafting at our table and through the dining room.  I could understand this if it had been midnight and we were the only table remaining, but it was 9:45 and the restaurant was still at least half full.  One of the people in our party has a lung condition, so we choked down a few more bites and headed out.  The grand total for our meal:  $300.    For less money and a far better experience, I'll head a few doors down to Terra, which offers gluten free options (we asked at Stagioni and were told, \"we don't have anything gluten free.\"), a cozy environment, knowledgeable waitstaff and great food.",

    "text": "We hadn't been to Charlotte in a while due to hectic work & person schedules, so when we finally planned a weekend trip my sister-in-law was extremely excited for us to try this restaurant.  Her and her husband had been to Stagioni a few times and had loved it every time so we really excited to go here.  The restaurant is small and very intimate, which is fine and it has a great atmosphere.  The first issue, which is really more of a personal opinion and may not bother other people, is that the waitress didn't ever write down any orders.  I usually am pretty particular with how I order, so it makes me nervous when the waiters don't write down my order.  So we were a big group and were pretty hungry so we started with 3 of the \"snacks\", arancini, brussel sprouts pizza and octopus.  The snacks were all delicious - but seriously tiny!  Think of the size of the condiment pots restaurants will sometimes give you, and that is seriously the size of each snack.  Get the truffled cauliflower - it is seriously one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  That item alone would give this place 5 stars, but there were too many other issues.  The pizza was delicious also - my only suggestion is to pre-cut it and skip the scissors, they are huge and awkward and kind of change the mood they're going for.  I didn't eat the octopus but it got mixed reviews at the table.  OK so the big issue - the arancini came and looked amazing!  We all quickly split the 3 pieces in half and each took our half. The first person took a bite and immediately spit it out and the second person did the same.  The balls were frozen in the center!  It was seriously strange.  There shouldn't have been any reason for them to be frozen, but they were. So we told the waitress and she took them away and a few minutes later they brought back a new plate.  The balls were luke warm and just weren't anything like the arancini I'm used - they weren't cheesy at all and were too lemony for my taste.  For the mains, I had the Fettuccini, which was OK, but nothing too special. My husband had the pork saltimbocca which was OK, but had way too much panceta compared to the size of pork and the vinegar in the polenta didn't seem to go.  All in all, the meal was decent but after everything we had heard we were pretty let down.",

Main dishes, I ordered the mahi mahi with burnt orange sauce - just lovely, perfectly cooked fish and wonderful Med style flavors of the orange sauce complemented it perfectly.

The sauce is incredible- sweet, and very tomato-y. The crust is perfect although very thin in the middle so if you like thick crust this may not be for you. The sausage was very flavorful as well and we highly recommend the pepperoni and sausage pie if you like meat. We liked the pizza so much we got a second one to take home. As for the rest...the atmosphere is cozy and romantic, the perfect place for a special occasion. We also tried the meatballs which were delicious with another delicious marinara sauce. I'm telling you, you could eat a bowl of the sauces at this place and be quite happy with your meal. Make sure to make a reservation as this place is small. Overall, a great experience and we will be back.",

We were seated shortly after our reservation time of 7:45 (New Years Eve so I can understand that). Our pre Appetizers were sumptuous truffle balls which filled the restaurant with a lush rich aroma. The garden fresh salad with candied pork belly was amazing! I chose the Carolina grouper and the Chocolate dessert. There are just no words for the dessert! It was delicious!!!! Our waiter was a lot of fun and we really enjoyed our first experience here. Our holiday visit was a memorable one ;)",

    "text": "I'm usually a Bruce Moffett fan. Never had a disappointing meal at Barrington's and never had a bad meal at Good Food. I'm sorry but Stagioni fell short of expectations for me. I would put it a long third place vs. the other two.  The restaurant is loud when it's busy (and it's usually busy), not a sort of place you like to shout to your friends or when you are on a date in my humble opinion. The ambiance was great for a bar, but the tables were a little too close together for my comfort.  The piece of resistance (why can't I create accents on here is beyond me...), the food:  The liver mousse was ok, pickled veggies were a bit too drowned in the dressing for my taste. The octopus was nothing out of this world, but I like octopus more than most so I've had very good ones, this place doesn't have it. The best appetizer had to be the pork belly, very nicely done, crunchy skin with a balsamic dressing that cuts the heaviness pretty well - my favorite dish of the evening. The veal was not good - you can't make something good just by adding bacon on top... Which is what I felt they did here. The quail unfortunately had the same fault... Bacon doesn't make it better - both dishes were overpowered by the richness of the bacon.   The service was less than stellar for a restaurant of this magnitude.   They have a good wine list and to their defense, Stagioni's menu should change seasonally, I'm looking forward to what summer has available.  All in all, this trip to Stagioni wasn't worth the price tag... but I'll have to give it another shot soon...",

Another fave app was the squash blossoms. Crunchy warm slightly oily shell hiding the smooth marscapone inside. The white bean hummus and mixed olives were okay- not something Id reorder.    The pizza, like everyone says, is a must. They get the perfect amt of crispy crust and melty cheese.  The sides they offer are a great deal esp since they are huge.   Our waiter, JP, was very attentive and friendly. Their small staff really work well together- helping each other out. Another server- Wilson was great at making sure we had clean cutlery, water was filled, and that dinner went smoothly.",

    "text": "For our 13th anniversary, my wife and I decided to try this relatively new Northern Italian restaurant in Charlotte's Eastover neighborhood. The meal was terrific, particularly the fried Risotto Balls that started things off, and the INCREDIBLE Gnocchi that followed. Both paired perfectly with a wonderful bottle of Barolo from their extensive selection of Italian wines.  I was a bit disappointed, though, with the Grouper we ordered for our main course. It came highly recommended by our server, but I found it to be a bit dry and lacking in flavor. I would not order it again. For dessert, we shared a fantastic plate of zeppoli, along with a pair of cannolis that were decent, but unfortunately underwhelming. For the price, I expected more.  I wanted to like this restaurant more than I did, but considering they've only been open a few months, I'm hopeful the menu selections will improve by our next visit. There are better restaurants in Charlotte for the money, but Stagioni is a welcome addition to the local dining scene, and one that I hope will be around for many years to come!",

Farm-centric, in-house everything.  Well executed and balanced and the service really knows the menu.   To give you an idea of what we ate...er, what DIDN'T we eat?  4 of us got about 15 dishes to share, and every bite was excellent.   Standouts: Housemade ricotta. Cauliflower truffle spread.  Chicken skins.  (Which taste real meaty and delicious.  They actually ran out the night we dined b/c they're so popular.) Grilled octopus (oh man, the sauce...we lapped up the sauce long after the tentacles were all gone...) agnolotti (all homemade pastas...as they should be) and this crazy delicious parsnip puree and brussels sprout pizza. Oh, and the dessert zeppoli are possibly the lightest, most addicting melt-in-your-mouth delicious way to end a meal.    PS:  Take note of the cool decor, including the fake-out bookshelf that's really a door.  Also, they've got prosecco on tap (how cool!?) and their pear cocktail is simply light and sweet and smooth.    PPS: The dress-up scale on this place is about the same as GF.  You could wear a suit, or wear jeans and a button up and be perfectly comfortable.",

    "text": "My experience was not all that I hoped it would be but I am going to try and keep this review fair and balanced.  First impressions...My manager was taking me to dinner to discuss \"work-related\" things but she loves good food and service as much as I do.  She called 3 times to make a reservation for Tuesday evening but never received a call back. Fail #1.    Moving on....We were excited to be there and the atmosphere was just perfect.  As soon as I pulled up to the restaurant I was excited because even the building has an old-world feel.  The inside decor seems to be a modern twist on a tuscan vibe.  The exposed kitchen, the rustic wood tables, dim lighting, etc.  I loved it.    We were sitting for a while before anyone really greeted us but eventually a young girl came up and poured our water.  She made sure to tell us \"I am not your waitress.  I am just here to pour water.\"  It was almost like she wanted to make sure we didn't ask her for anything else.  Eventually our waitress surfaced and she seemed in a rush and a bit distracted.  I mean the place was packed but the place is only so big so it didn't seem overwhelming but maybe these are the kinks that are still being worked out as a new establishment.    We decided to start with a lemon drop martini.  I followed my boss' lead on this because I don't even know the last time I had a \"cocktail\" but she wanted me to try it as it is one of her favorites!  Enter Fail #2....The martini was super sweet and not very lemony and it was like drinking straight up lemonade.  I was told that the sugar is usually on the rim and it balances the sour part but this was just all thrown in and not concocted very well honestly.  Even I knew that.  Moving on...  We ordered a couple appetizers to start.  At first I thought ordering two appetizers for two people seemed a little piggish but once they came out and they were more in proportion to serve a small child, I was glad we went with two.  We ordered the risotto balls (don't know the fancy italian term) and they were fried balls with a risotto and mozzarella center.  The were served on a plate with a nice marina sauce for dipping.  They were excellent.  3 balls came with the appetizer.  We also ordered the braciole which was very good as well.  It was shaped like a pinwheel and there was a mozzarella cheese in the center.  It was also served with a marinara sauce.  The meat was very tender and the flavor was perfect.  I enjoyed this dish.  Fail #3 was because we never got any bread that was supposed to be served prior to our meal.  We asked a waitress about it and she acted like she was perplexed but eventually brought us two rolls.  We proceeded to order our entrees and chose two pasta dishes with a side of spinach.  The pasta was very good, creative combinations, nice flavoring, etc.  We got about half way through our meals and realized we never saw the spinach--Fail #4.  Our waitress was absolutely nowhere to be found.  Actually, she was found....found behind the bar.  I don't know if she was on double duty or why she was playing two roles but she was doing neither of them very well.  She never came to check on us during our meal.  We found the \"water\" girl and told her about our missing spinach so she said she would go take care of it.  Guess what?  She didn't.  Eventually I saw our waitress passing by so I called out for her and told her we never received our spinach.  She apologized but that was that.  She asked if we still wanted it but by that point of course we didn't!  We just asked for the dessert menu.    Desserts:  The pear cake was recommended because it was a staple at \"Good Food.\"  It was served with Avocado ice cream.  The cake was just a bland piece of cake in a little square with maybe 2 very thinly sliced pears on the top.  Odd.  Not great.  The avocado ice cream had a distinct flavor and it was creamy but somewhat bland.  The Zeppolis were the hit.  They were fluffy, light, perfectly coated in powdered sugar and done very well.    My overall expectations were not met.  Good Food and Barrington's are the \"talk\" in town so I expected more of a sophistication from the staff and management.  I would still come back but I do hope they iron out some of these kinks.",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to trying Stagioni since they opened, so maybe my expectations were too high? They called to confirm our Saturday at 7:00 p.m. reservation earlier in the day, and when we arrived, there was no one at the hostess stand. We waited... and waited... and waited. Finally, a random waiter came over to greet us. He grabbed menus, told us to follow him, and walked into the dining room... where he promptly turned around to tell us our table wasn't ready yet. So, back into the bar we walked. We grabbed a seat at the bar and realized that the dining room looked awfully crowded and noisy, so we decided that we should just sit in the bar when the waiter came back to tell us our table was now ready. We decided to just sit at a table in the bar.  Service got a little better from there, but the bartender - who was waiting on us - seemed pretty overwhelmed most of the evening since she seemed to be the only one making drinks and waiting on the bar patrons.  The food was good. We started with a meat and cheese tray, which was tasty. For dinner, I had the rigatoni entree - the pasta was a little dense/heavy, but the creamy tomato sauce with bacon was smoky and delicious - and the fella got the quail - which was pretty tasty and rare to find on a menu. For dessert, we took the bartender's suggestion and got the zeppoli (light, flaky, Italian donuts) with salted caramel gelato, which the fella said was the best thing he ate all night, and I said was too salty to eat.  The architecture is pretty cool, and I almost felt like I was in a castle or an old church. The ceilings had really cool exposed wooden beams, and the lights all had red globes, which made everything very dark and sexy. Seating in the dining area is a little tight and a little loud, so we thought the bar was where it was at, but there was also a pizza bar at the back of the dining room that looked pretty cool, too.  I think I'll give them another couple of months before I try them again, but I was just a little let down on my first visit.",

    "text": "Stagioni continues to baffle me... I've been 5 times now and each experience has swung wide one way or the other, either really good or really underwhelming.   The first time I went, they'd only been open for a couple weeks. Food was decent but service was way off. I blame that on the newness. It took me almost a year to visit again. This time, our experience was out of this world and I thought they'd hit their stride. Food was amazing and service was even better. But then... Over the next three visits, one was a miss, one was a hit and the last, our family-style Christmas Eve dinner was somewhere in the middle.   I'll use what we ate on Christmas Eve as an example of their inconsistency...   Starters were spot on -- arranchini, truffled eggs, pickled veggies and warm ricotta were all so good and well timed coming to the table.   Salad came next. In Italy, that's a serious faux pas, btw. Salad comes at the end of the meal, after the secondi. The Caesar salad we had was so mundane it wasn't even worth eating. Some wilted greens, a lot of cheese and a garlic crouton thing that had gone a little soggy.   Primi were 2 pastas -- the sweet potato gnocchi was perfect but the spaghetti with prawns, while tasty, was awkward to eat on account of the head on prawns. Our waitress told us that the dish usually came with scallops. Would have been a much better option!   Secondi was where they really lost me. We were dreaming of the wood oven roasted porchetta all day but when it came, were so let down, I almost cried. The dish was a pork loin wrapped in pork belly. The center part with the loin was good enough but was surrounded by the greasiest, fattiest piece of pork  belly I've ever had. It's making my stomach turn just thinking about it again. HUGE let down!   We choose spinach and potatoes for our sides. The potatoes were good but let's be honest, it's pretty hard to screw up potatoes. The spinach was really bitter, to the point where I think it might have actually been Swiss chard.   Dessert was an average assortment of cookies and small, honey soaked dough balls.   So, therein lies Stagioni's problem. Sometimes they're spot on, sometimes they're awful. When you're paying an average of $100+ per person (with drinks), the inconsistency is hard to swallow. I think we'll probably be back but stick with pizza at the bar instead of racking up a huge tab on food that might or might not be worth it.",

The reason for 3 stars is the service, and not from the wait staff, our server was great. I'm going to assume it was the manager, after we finished eating, we were chatting and trying to digest. Apparently talking after dinner is not appreciated here. I feel like the staff was stalking our table, keep in mind there were several empty tables around us. The lady came up and pretty much asked us to leave which I felt was quite rude and actually shocking. It's a shame, we really enjoyed the food and our server, but the manager (?) clinched the title for this one, it's likely we won't return.",

The only negative story I have from the evening was overhearing a group arguing with the amazing manager, Lee Ann, about making a reservation. It was so clear the group had fibbed about making a reservation but Lee Ann was trying to be accommodating as she can (the restaurant was packed!!). Hearing their attitude was honestly the worst memory of the night. Everything else was absolutely perfect! If you haven't eaten here, get any of the pizzas, the pastas, and the zeppelis. So good. For drinks? Russ knows everything. Tell him your flavor profile and you will not go wrong with his recommendation.",

    "text": "The food must be exceptional because the restaurant was nearly packed and it was a Tuesday night. I read reviews where people celebrated special occasions quite often, and they had positive things to say. It was a special occasion for us. I was helping my niece celebrate her 21st birthday in a memorable way.  She told me she wanted to go to a fancy place but not too fancy. Lol. So I did my homework. I spent days trying to choose a very nice place that a 21 year old picky eater would enjoy. I picked the wrong place to celebrate.   Everything was awesome until we stepped inside. We had done some major clothes shopping for her and had cocktails prior to  arriving... it was her first alcoholic beverage she had ever ordered. Then we arrived at the restaurant and found parking and took lots of pictures of us and the mansion. It was beautiful. Everything was perfect until we stepped inside.    As soon as I walked in the door it took everything I had to hide the disappointment on my face. I knew I was at the right place but it was nothing like I imagined it to be.  Had I not read all the great reviews I  would have thought I was in a Tavern or Pub. I have no problem spending money on fine dining. It's not their problem I did not like one of the dishes. I knew it was a gamble.   But I Do desire a tiny bit of ambiance. Some small indication that it is a Fine dining establishment.   It was very dark inside. Did not even feel like a bistro. I don't really know how to describe it. It had some beautiful art on the walls that I could see close by where we were sitting.  We didn't have to wait and everyone from the hostess, wait person and bartender were very nice. Our table was super small. With tables to our left and right. So at first I thought to myself. Great....no privacy. I wanted to talk to her about some personal matters. But as we sat down I quickly realized we were not going to be able to talk at all!!!  If we both leaned forward across the table and were LESS than a foot away from each other and spoke as loud as we could with out yelling, then we could talk to one another. I was so disappointed. I was so angry because I felt like I let my niece down, but I tried to make the best of it. It was not going to be the leisurely dinner that I thought it would be. We had to basically yell all of our questions and orders to the nice woman who was waiting on our table and we had to yell to the kind bartender who came to our table to help make something special for my niece to enjoy. And because the place was busy busy, everything FELT rushed. They did not rush us though. We ate quickly and left as soon as we could.   We had one appetizer, a pizza each, one dessert and three drinks. The tab before gratuity was $96.00. The appetizer was the SQUASH BLOSSOMS (13) and it was quite nice... My niece had the PEPPERONI + SAUSAGE pizza minus the sausage (15) and I had the TARTUFI pizza (15). Unfortunely it was way too sweet for me to eat. I took it home and ended up just throwing it out. My mistake. I should have ordered something different.  My favorite was the desert ZEPPOLI. (8).     So the food is really good. Seems like a place thst corporate business diners would enjoy . Not a place for a leisurely calm or romantic dinner. At least that's the way I felt. IF I was a guest of someone who took me there it would have been fine. But it was a special occasion, and not what I was looking for that night. It's going to be hard to rate. The people are nice and efficient.  It's just does not have the ambiance I want when the entrees   are around $30 each. We had just pizza. OBTW. I did like my nieces pizza!!!  Ciao.",

We really liked the bar, rustic / old world vibe.  Great bar tenders (Russ).   Had a variety of small plates and a  pizza, all were excellent and very unique.  Our fav was the butternut squash.  Prices were very fair.  Overall, one of our best recent meals and dining experiences. Only complaint was hostess. Made reservations for our anniversary and reminded her on arrival. She sat us at a tiny 2 top (dining room was empty).  When we asked for a larger table, she refused and told us that they were for \"reservations\" (which we had).  Dining room remained half full entire night. Glad we sat in bar.",

    "text": "Based on all the great reviews, we decided to try Stagioni for a special occasion this past Thursday. I was looking forward to trying their house-made pasta. We had a reservation for 630pm and arrived to an empty restaurant only to be seated in a corner. Not off to a good start but I'll be a sport and let it slide as long as I don't have to sit in the walkway looking at the kitchen.   Our waitress came over as soon as we sat down, barely having opened menus and asked if we were ready to order drinks. Without suggestions, she left us for a couple minutes before returning again and asking us for our drinks order. Did she have somewhere else to be? I don't understand why we were being rushed. We ordered a glass of wine and the mango habanero cocktail at around $12 each. The waitress asked us if we'd dined at Stagioni before and seemed annoyed when we said no because now she had to walk us through the menu as she told us about the daily specials. To start, we went with the 3/$16 charcuterie and cheese plate. I was expecting pickles or mustard on the side but it came with honey and toasted bread. We tried the prosciutto, bresaola and a soft cheese. Reasonable portions for all three and nicely plated . We also decided on an order of squash blossoms. There were 3 on the plate; they were very sweet and heavily sauced. Lots of components on the plate; seems they love their micro-greens at Stagioni. For mains, my husband ordered one of the pizzas which came with scissors. I'm sorry but scissors? At a $$$ restaurant? He ate most of the pizza and took the last two pieces home. I ordered the shrimp pasta which was heavy on cream sauce with 5 shrimp. I tasted grit as I was finishing my plate. Off-putting for sure. We skipped dessert and made our way out of the restaurant $105 lighter.   Overall, the service is odd with plates being dropped off by runners with no explanation, rushed pacing and several staff members hanging around in the bar area socializing and eating in view of patrons. The decor of the restaurant is strange with red lamps which always make me think \"red light district\". We saw several tables using their smartphone flashlights to read the small print on the menus in the dark. Do they realize the customer who can afford to eat here wears reading glasses and would appreciate the lights on and the menus at a 14pt font? For how expensive the restaurant is, I would think they could pay attention to the patrons' needs and train their staff to read personal cues better. Too much to ask?",

I had recently moved back to Charlotte and was really excited about going for my birthday.  I ordered the truffle tagliatelle and it tasted like butter with noodles. My brothers risotto with duck was salted like they were being stored for winter . The pizza was good so I'd recommend that . One of the waitresses was shoving food at my father and he was a little uncomfortable receiving his order. It's unfortunate because this was my favorite restaurant in Charlotte so needless to say I'm disappointed .",

    "text": "Visited Stagioni as a group of  8 on July 4 weekend. I'm not well versed in the Charlotte restaurant scene, but we had a great experience here.   We had an 830 reservation and were seated right away in a corner in the back dining room. The exterior of the building is very Tuscan, but inside the vibe was trendy and cozy - Dark(but not too dark), Rustic(with a touch of industrial), and bustling(but not too loud). The dining room was full but we could still hear each other speaking at a normal volume.   All of the food we ate was excellent - as a table we sampled the meatballs, charcuterie, grilled octopus, and a margherita pizza. The octopus left a little to be desired - it was slightly tough and a touch under seasoned, but Stagioni gets a pass since every other dish was a home run. Dinner for me was the truffle pasta, which was out of this world. I also appreciated that the portions were generous, but not enormous. We left satisfied but not feeling gross. Several of our dates had the Pork Chop and all agreed it was outrageous. We ordered one dessert (coconut panna cotta) and it was good - a little tart for most of our tastes, but a generous portion and nice execution (served in a stemless wine glass).   On top of the food, the service was attentive but not annoying. Our waitress knew the menu inside and out and was thorough in guiding us through the meal. I cannot comment on the drink list as we had decided previously that we would share the sparkling rose for dinner, but one of my dinner companions did have a cocktail that she thought was lovely.   I would definitely recommend this spot for bigger groups (with a reservation of course). There is also an outdoor patio / bar in the back of the restaurant that we did not get to enjoy on account of some unexpected rain. Looking forward to checking it out next time we are in town.",

    "text": "To commemorate our 3rd wedding anniversary, we planned to go to this $$$ rated Stagioni !  The FOOD cannot go wrong here, definitely a $$$ quality, taste and presentation.  Loved it.  But the restaurant's ambience, seating, serving, space between tables, noise, etc. definitely not a $$$ experience, but again we would definitely go back for the food but may be with a more casual dressing lol. We initially thought of ordering some wine, but the jolly atmosphere made us opt for beers ;) started off with some nice Belgium ales and Charred Octopus as an appetizer.  Loved the octopus - it was cooked in their oven (used to bake pizza) and the char was perfect and crispy on the outside.  We also got some complimentary bread and bread sticks in a paper bag (weird ?!?) rather than getting them served on a plate. Our server was very good - polite, knowledgeable, explained everything in detail and made sure we were doing fine all the time.  We were told if we could give all the order at one time, it would be easier for the chef and get it done on time and quick. Ordered Baked Rigatoni and Quail for the main course - both were outstanding.  Baked Rigatoni had baked rabbit as the meat and it was perfectly cooked and rigatoni was just delicious.  Fried quail legs - was very tasty and the puree on the plate was extremely delicious, had to order a side of angles hair since just the fried quail legs were more like a finger food for me lol. BEST PART - The dessert - Zeppoli and Warm Torta. If you looked up yelp before going to Stagioni, you would know you \"have\" to try Zeppoli.  As rightly described those ARE pillows of heaven.  Similar to beignets only more softer and tastier with salted caramel sauce on the side (damnnnnnnnn).  The lady of the couple sitting in our adjacent table couldn't resist the sweet aroma of these Zeppoli and asked us what that was, ROFL. Warm Torta was just out of the world - chocolate cake, crumbly on the outside and gooey inside with vanilla icecream or gelato on top.  the candied sweet potatoes are the show stealer of this dessert. Loved the FOOD, loved the service !",

He is extremely knowledgable of his local purveyor's and passionate about his food.   Hand made pastas, sausages, and well balanced entrees leveraging a High Heat Brick Oven and fun staff.   Check this place out, you will not be disappointed. Hoping for a summer filled with Seafood as Dodd is very focused on maintaining his seasonal approach!   We Will Be Back Soon",

    "text": "The dinner group met here.  From the pictures, it seemed like a fancy place but when I arrived and saw the servers in jeans and t-shirts, I realized it was not so fancy.    Although the house is somewhat large, it appears Stagioni is only using a portion of the building so the restaurant interior is really not that large.  There is one room for the bar and a few bar tables.  Then there is a dining room in the next room with an open kitchen.  The decor consists of various mirrors on one wall and a bookshelf on another wall.  There is a counter in front of the bar for additional seating.    The menu is contemporary Italian with pastas, fish, pizza and everything is creatively displayed.  I ordered the Tega Hills Greens salad which was stacked lettuce with goat cheese and on the side a few beets, pine nuts with a very light dressing.  It was wonderful and so beautifully presented.  For an entree, I went with the Flounder which was a rectangular portion of fish over greens with molded potatoes and and drizzled sauce on the side.  It also was beautifully presented.  The crust on the fish was wonderful and the greens was very unique.  I could sit there and savor every bite trying to figure out what the flavors were.    For desert, I went with the pear cake which came with avocado gellato and homemade whipped cream.  Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the cake.  It actually reminded me somewhat of a bread pudding.  The gellato was creamy but I didn't really catch the avocado flavor.    Also, don't let the size of the parking lot fool you.  There is additional parking behind the restaurant.  Just drive down Fenton a little and you'll see the entrance.  You'll also see a different view of the building which is has a patio that would be great for outdoor dining but it went unused.",

I loved being able to watch my food being prepared!   We started with the Stagioni Charcuterie appetizer plate, I don't remember everything that was on it but it was ALL delicious! And those rolls....WOWsers. Warm little heavenly goodness. Oh yeah and they are freshly made in house....yeah, they're cool like that.   After that we ordered the Tartufi pizza which comes with caramelized onions, fontina, arugula and truffle oil. Shut up!!! That was one of the BEST pizzas I've ever had. It was probably the truffle oil...or the crust but either way....when I go back (and I will definitely be going back) I'll be getting this again! Yum.   For dinner everyone tried something different, I ordered the risotto, but was also able to tasted the rigatoni, and the agnolotti! Yum. Yum. Yum. All the dishes were delish!   The menu changes often so it will always be something worth trying here! I'm sure you can tell...but I'm already looking forward to coming back!",

    "text": "Brussels Sprout Pizza (see photo) ... the end!  More?  Okay, here's the real review:  Though we arrived without making reservations on a late Friday evening, it didn't take long to get seated at the pizza bar.  The GM (and hostess for the evening) was a friendly, bubbly gal who handled our waiting time expectations very well.  Besides, we didn't mind since it gave us a chance to warm up near the fireplace.  On to the food that evening ...  Stuffed Peppadews, Anchovies and Radicchio, & Chicken Skins w/Olive Spread, House-Made Ricotta & Eggplant Caponata - A little gimmicky, but guests can select from a wide array of snacks to whet the appetite.  Of our selection, Chicken Skins, while simple, were executed with precision such that it was light, crispy, and not too greasy.  Also, I could put their Olive Spread on anything - hell, a napkin.  Napkin with Olive Spread?  Seconds, please.    Grilled Octopus - Slightly hesitant on octopus in general, but better than your run-of-the-mill calamari appetizer.  Flavors abound.    Brussels Sprout Pizza - Friggin' amazing.  Fired to perfection in a stone pizza oven, the marriage of pecorino and pancetta complimented the Brussels sprout so well we scarfed down the pizza within minutes.  It had a tinge of heat (spiciness) underscoring the pizza - gotta love that too.  Rest assured, any pizza elsewhere from here out will severely pale in comparison.  YOU MUST GET THIS (and invite me).  Gnocchi - IMO, one of the staples to judge an Italian restaurants by.  Stagioni passes the test.  Zeppoli - Italian beignets with a scoop of salted caramel gelato.  While the gelato was a great way to end the meal, the beignets could have been baked a little longer.  Hey, every restaurant has to have SOMETHING to work on - this minor point is theirs.  A spectacular dining experience.  I look forward to coming back for the Brussels Sprout Pizza (of course) and the Brodetto Di Pesci (the two chicks next to me were loving this mixed seafood dish - think Herbal Essence shampoo commercials).     Oh yeah, big ups to Wilson, yo.  Great service and on-point recommendations.  dmo out.",

When calling to confirm with a credit card they changed the reservation time and were not accommodating. My family has been in the wine and restaurant business for over 20 years. This type of \"service\" lost them a large party of customers. The bartender was however, fantastic. We will be dining elsewhere.",

    "text": "Like a villa you'd find in the heart of Tuscany, the setting of Stagioni could not be in a more perfect building.  Somehow in the midst of Charlotte, this gem of a restaurant transports you all the way to Italy without the TSA getting in the way.  The setting is perhaps the greatest asset.  It's incredibly homey, and oh so Italian trattoria.  The waiters are friendly and passionate about the food.  Ask anyone of them and you'll surely hear a colorful description of the ingredients.  Don't forget to ask about the wine.  What was likely one of my few chances to eat here, I wanted to try everything, especially a pasta.  Two great options; the garganelli and the gnocchi caught my attention.  I ended up with the gnocchi which came with a rabbit and thyme.  The thyme really masked some of the rabbit's gamey flavor.  This was preceded by a pretty terrific house ricotta, which in my opinion is perhaps on par with what I'd find at my favorite Italian grocery in New York.    The wine list here is legitimately Italian, with plenty of great options from all over Italy.  I was glad to see some Amarone on the list, even if a bit pricier of a bottle.  It's one of those wines you could savor over a long Italian dinner.  4.5 stars.  I can't help but think that this place is a bit under appreciated.  In any other city, they would bustling every night.  Don't wait.  Come here and definitely order like the Italians do and linger, with a bottle of wine of course.",

Since Stagioni was owned by the owners of Barringtons (one of our favorites), I thought we would give Stagioni a shot. Where do I begin.... A. We were seated by the ladies room and a steel exterior door. We were all freezing.  B. I asked about the Calamari, and they said it was stuffed with ham and that's the way they do it. I asked if they could leave out the ham, and the waitress said no. Not a red meat eater I passed.  C. The portions were very very small, served on a large plates. 2 of our dishes were cold. The order  Rigatoni was undercooked. Both were sent back. The duck was tasteless and the rigatoni was still undercooked and only warm. D. We were charged different prices on the wine when we asked for refills. E. They actually deducted 2 of the entree's and the bill was still $124. F. The glasses of wine were barely filled... and at $13 a glass. Now, I don't care about the money if the food is good, but this was a disgrace. Since I selected the restaurant, you can imagine my embarrassment.  As I told my guests...\"It's only a mistake if you do it twice\".   We will not come back.",

    "text": "We visited Stagioni on New Years Eve 2015, after looking at the chef chose pre-fix menu I was very excited to try EVERYTHING Stagioni had to offer. My boyfriend and I were joined by another couple for our reservation. When we first pulled up to the restaurant I was very surprised where this little gem was tucked off providence ! - there isn't a lot of parking out front but if you go down to the next side street there is plenty! Overall I was pleased with our entire dining experience. We were warmly greeted at the door and shown to our table which was awaiting our arrival. Prior to the first course of amuse bouche the nice waiter brought over complimentary prosecco (#winning!!). Dining with other foodies is great and we decided to ensure we ordered at least one of everything on the menu. For the antipasto we tried the burrato, a pork sausage tortellini and a beef carpaccio. All of these dishes were delicious, we especially liked the \"pot liquor brodo\" poured into the tortellini ( essentially a delicious fancy broth). Next up was primi which we feasted on a sweet potato cavatelli  and a spaghetti lamb sugo. The ladies both voted we loved the potato cavatelli with the brown butter sage and Brussels sprouts while both of the guys preferred the lamb spaghetti. The spaghetti had a delicious essence of citrus which provides a balance to the hearty lamb sauce. We all really enjoyed the rustic pastas which clearly were made in house -- who doesn't love fresh pasta!? The main event was the secondi ( largest portions) consisting of a grouper  over saffron risotto , porchetta with red lentils and a wood fired NY strip. All of these dishes were good but underwhelmed me ( can we go back to the other courses ?). FYI if you don't know what porchetta is it is essentially a roll of pork surrounded with pork belly (fat) - although I've had pork belly before my outside bites of this dish had me turn my plate over to my boyfriend ( he liked it though!!) The best part of the NY strip was the parsnip puree and the black truffle veal sauce.  We ended the meal with an assortment of small desserts including dark chocolate truffles and fudge.  Overall a great meal to share with friends who are open to trying new things - picky eaters beware this is not for you!!",

The problem lies within the fact you can't make a reservation for 5 people or more. For a Rez, you must call and only leave a VM because no one will answer. You hope to get a call back but if you do not, I assume you are supposed assume you do not have a reservation. We called , left the messaged but still decided to show up. The manager Leanne argued with us for not making a reservation- when we explained we called and left the VM she basically said we were lying because \"she never got the message\" we asked several times what we should have done? But she continued to yell at us for not calling (we 100% did call and left a VM) .. if it's just 2 of you, you should be fine but definitely do not go here for parties of 5 or more. Extremely unprofessional manager and unfortunately affected our dinner",

I got the Nettie Linguine (lamb) $27 and it was excellent !  One person got the lump crab bake $32 and said it was spicy and you could not taste the crab as a result, even though you could see it in there.  The gelato $3 for 1 scoop was very good.  I was told the steak $30 was very good.  I was also told the broccoli prosciutto pizza was excellent. This place is great if you are careful about what you order.",

The food is very good, my husband and I went for our 2 year anniversary and then had to come back two weeks later with my parents because of how good it was.   We got the arancini and meatballs for an appetizer, both had great flavor. We each had a different dish and I loved that the pizza had to be cut by the patrons, very Italian!   The only complaint I have is the noise level and sitting by the pizza bar. We were at a table but it was close to the kitchen so very warm and don't love open kitchen concepts, I don't need to see what goes on back there. It's also very loud. Other than that I'll be back many more times!",

It would be better in a simple bread basket. My salad was good, and I'm thankful for that otherwise I would have left hungry. Our server also brought me the WRONG wine.

Once inside, you are greeted by a hostess with several high-top tables. They will then take you to your table in the back, of our made a reso (highly suggested).  The dining area a very spacious and is opened to the kitchen where you can see the cooks prepare your food.  There are even bar seating options where you can sit almost in the kitchen.  The cooks serve you directly from the kitchen; it doesn't get more fresh than that!  I appreciate the open concept, because many time it can be unnerving not knowing what is exactly going on behind those closed kitchen doors.     The atmosphere is very warm, yet dark. I'd say it's a lovely place for a date or a cozy dinner with close friends.  The drink menu has a huge range of wines as well as specialty drinks.  I have always been amazed and pleased by the level of professional service they offer their patrons.  They do not hire jut anyone, and that is very much appreciated.  Their staff are very knowledgeable about the food and are clearly invested in you having a pleasant experience.  Our waiter made some fine selections for us off the wine menu.  As a vegetarian, he even offered some combinations that made my tastebuds extremely satisfied.  #TrufflePasta  He even told us about wine tasting a they have started hosting, which would be of great interest to me.    I certainly suggest a reso! This can be hard to get in otherwise.   You may need a European car to park here, but you will need a mini van to take you away.  The food is so delicious you will overeat, that's a promise.",

There's a little bit of an identity crisis for a pizza/pasta restaurant with a five page wine selection and $30+ entrees.   Atmosphere is very nice, restaurant is well configured and the open kitchen is great.   We ordered a number of items and got a bottle of wine plus a couple of desserts, coffee, etc.   $48 for a $12-15 bottle of Ormanni Chianti was a little ridiculous.   Lobster bisque, the dark green color was completely off-putting, flavor was good, except for the potato chips that just seemed odd. Also, be prepared for, literally, zero pieces of lobster.   Stuffed squash flowers were amazing, beautiful presentation and well balanced.   Octopus, burnt, fishy tasting and totally lost in a bedding of celery, sliced beans, and pork rinds?  Mussels, drowned in cream sauce. They also seemed a little over cooked. Decent flavor in the sauce but way too thick.   Scallop Spaghetti, pretty much a total disaster. The scallops tasted like they were cooked separately, were rubbery and way over salted. The pasta was in a very thick cream sauce with some bacon? which may have been supposed to be pancetta.   Broccolini, amazing except for two of the ~10 stalks that were drowned in salt. It was really confusing.   Mushrooms, amazing. Well cooked, delicious. Probably my favorite item of the night and it was a side.   Raspberry sorbet, was what you would expect, very tiny portion compared to the other dessert.   Zeppolis, fantastic. Perfectly cooked and powdered, classic taste I remember from when I was a kid. They serve you 5-6 huge pieces which looked really funny next to the two golf ball sized scoops of sorbet!  Not what I expected from a $200+ dinner at a place with a sign out from that says \"Pizza, Pasta, Vino\" and servers in T-Shirts.",

The food was delicious, but incredibly expensive with very small portion sizes. My wife and I each got a pasta dish, with maybe 6 oz of pasta, neither with protein, both about $30. My wife added pancetta which was an additional $7. We each got a glass of wine and I got a salad, total was about $140.   The food was very good, but the prices for what you get are almost laughable. If the service was great it might be worth it, but ours was average and we felt pretty rushed. Overall not the best experience; I think there are better values to be had elsewhere.",

The food was excellent and my grouper and the oyster aperitvo was divine. The restaurant is located in a beautifull old house in residential Eastover, an old Charlotte neighborhood. The service was good but servers changed midmeal. We went on a Thursday evening at 6:30, thinking it would be fairly quiet for an intimate meal. But there were families with children, and many groups of reveling singles. I did love seeing the portrait of Blanche Gormajenko, as I grew up in the neighborhood and the stories  of her were legendary. But it is propbably not a place I would return, all things considered.",

The service was very friendly which goes a long way -- everyone we interacted with was super nice and easy going. The food was, over all, \"meh\" for me. We split a pizza as an appetizer, and it was great. Our entrees were underwhelming -- so much so that I can't remember exactly what we got.   The thing that really killed it for me was the vibe. I don't quite know how to explain it but it was like it wanted to be upscale but didn't have anything to back it up. I can do upscale or low key dining, even downright dive joints, so it wasn't that I felt this place was beneath me by any means. It was more so that it was trying to be something that it didn't need to. Just wasn't my scene.   Final verdict is that I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone but if someone said they were going I wouldn't try to stop them. It could be we went on a night when this just weren't meshing. But I doubt I'll ever go back, considering all the other options in Charlotte that I know i really enjoy.",

Took a few minutes, more than was comfortable to be greeted.  Finally, someone brought me water and I was ready to order a drink. He wasn't the server so he said someone would be over. In my opinion this was a miss, he should have just taken the drink order so the service would have been seamless. Anyhow, the server came over a few minutes later and took my wine order. I wasn't in a hurry as I intended to order a salad, pasta and pizza. The local baby greens was the salad I ordered. It was really good. Love, love the pickled onions and the goat cheese softened the bitterness of the balsamic and onions. I also ordered the Tonnarelli.  The pesto softened the pepper but I wonder why no one seems to do a True cacio de pepe in CLT. It was topped with shaved truffles which was nice but I am not a huge fan and probably didn't appreciate them as much as I should have given the $29 price. After sitting at the pizza bar for over an hour, I couldn't resist a pizza. I ordered the Stracciotella. It was good but I swear the simpler pepperoni pies coming out of the kitchen looked awesome. Overall my experience was ok. Service was lacking in that at times the sever just missed checking in. And yes, I ordered the box of Cannoli which the best was the pistachio one. I'd return to sit solo at the pizza bar or with a couple of friends so that we could order and share other entrees. One last thing, watching the pizza guy not only do pizza but also a lot of other items that are roasted in the oven was cool. (Actually it's pretty warm sitting there in front of the heat so be aware if that is not your thing).",

    "text": "Definitely one of those places that seems fancy, but it certainly isn't. We were visiting family at one of the (many) hospitals in the area, and were absolutely not dressed up. If anything, we were even dressed more casually than normal. Just to be certain, I checked up front, and they were fine with it - though they did put us at the back at the pizza bar, so there is that. And we were right outside of the men's room, so take that for what you will.  The good news it that you are (generally) facing the pizza oven, and not the men's room, but if you turn around, it is there in all its glory, should you choose to enjoy it.  Beyond that, the staff is very helpful, and they will serve you, location and all, no matter what you are wearing. So that's awesome. The food selection is solid, even though we were mostly sticking to the left side of the menu - no main courses here. Just too much going on. The good news is that there is plenty there to keep you interested and full along the way.  Since we were there early, it made for a nice break, but as things filled up, it got a bit louder, and naturally the location we were in saw some more traffic, so there is that, but the service didn't falter, and the food came out on a decent pace. Definitely worth trying the place again when we have more time to enjoy. And perhaps make a reservation for a better seat.",

Beth was our waitress and she was prompt, informative, and delightful throughout the entire meal.  The cocktails were deliciously crafted. Bella Rossa and Smoke N Coco were a couple of the cocktails we tried and definitely flavorful.   We started off with the PEI Mussels, Local Baby Greens Salad, and the House Smoked Mackerel. All appetizers were mouth-wateringly tasty.   We then ordered a couple of their tasty and unique pizzas with a side of Char-grilled carrots which more than met our expectations.  Then my most favorite part of the entire meal was served: Espresso, a specialty dessert with rich chocolate and lovely hints of spice, and a homemade lady finger Tiramisu. This Tiramisu was the absolute best, hands down, I have ever had and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and it's awesome staff!",

    "text": "A perfect evening to dine outdoors with friends at this beautiful Tuscan revival mansion! Wonderful ambiance! Upscale brown paper bags filled with thinly sliced airy, crispy bread is served with a carafe of rosemary-infused olive oil. Loved the bread, added salt & pepper to the oil, so the 2-3 slices I ate became a must! Especially with the bold, yet smooth chianti. They prepare creative dishes using local, seasonal flavors mixed with some Italian staples to make delicious & interesting meals. So go expecting to venture outside the usual Italian fare. Their menu constantly changes bc they cook with the seasons and whatever is fresh at the local farms. Really like this concept!  Now for the food:  Starter:  char-grilled octopus & sliced gigande beans atop a saffron aioli was very good & quite filling. It was all about the mixture of the ingredients bc the octopus alone was not the star. Primo: Truffle tagliatelle  lacked flavor & was alittle dry. I probably would have liked a sausage for added flavor, but at $32 for a one-person pasta dish ... that wasn't happening! Too bad there wasn't anymore room for dessert but I will go back to try more creations ... especially zeppole! Everyone was happy with everything they had, especially the warm asparagus salad & the primo, sweet potato cavatelli w.wild boar sausage, apples, collard greens & toasted pecans. All of their pastas, bread & sausage are made fresh, on site. Another nice concept! (GF is available) The 20% tip is already on the bill and bc of it, they make sure service is upto par. Service was excellent! Very knowledgable, assertive & mannerful which made for a great dining experience. Octopus+tagliatelle + 1 glass chianti w.tip just over $74. It's a treat ... an adventure I recommend trying.  4 bc I wasn't thrilled w.the truffle tagliatelle.",

    "text": "A fantastic experience from service to food.   Situated in a historic old Charlottean mini-mansion, you'll find Stagioni. This place doesn't disappoint at all. After several visits here, it is absolutely one of the best spots in Charlotte that you don't ever hear anyone talk about.   Stagioni is a really nice hybrid of fine and semi-casual dining. They have found this balance that says \"we are a nice restaurant, but most importantly we care about the food we serve\". This is the first restaurant that has offered a fine dining experience, but also doubled as my casual go-to spot for delicious pizza and beer. The inside offers a quaint, intimate, and darker setting that will absolutely be the highlight of your evening out.   The appetizers are delicious as are the main pasta dishes. You can't go wrong with anything seafood-based here. Even the table bread and rosemary olive oil are phenomenal. The drink selection is interesting without being too fussy. They offer some craft cocktails, good wine, and good draft beers.  Now, it's time to talk about the pizza. This is the best pizza in Charlotte. Whether you're a deep dish, NY style, or Neapolitan style fan, you will quickly fall in love with Stagioni's pizza. It's thin, with the right amount of soft and crunchy. The toppings, the cheese, the sauce...it's incredible. It's also the first time I have ever been given scissors to cut a pizza, which is actually quite efficient.    You owe it to yourself to try this place. Restaurants like these are holding up the food and restaurant reputation for Charlotte. Without a doubt, an unwavering 5/5.",

Our next course was the beet ravioli which was very unique and not what I expected but it was a very small portion.  For pasta we got the lamb rigatoni.  It was a little over cooked, but since I was our anniversary I didn't want to send it back.     For dessert we did the gelato sandwich.  My husband loved it but I didn't care for it.

I went for dinner on a Thursday night, and I highly suggest making a reservation. The place was packed, and the noise level was very loud. However, the experience was still fantastic. We ordered a cheeseboard, the meatball appetizer, and Taglioni pasta entrees.  Our server was great, and made recommendations for the cheeseboard that were in my opinion, hard for anyone to dislike. The whipped honey and fruit spread on the board were unique and delicious.  The meatballs were so tender and full of flavor. The garlic toast that they placed on the side was very good, and the sauce was too. The pasta was cooked to perfection, and the meat sauce that accompanied it was amazing. Portions were the perfect size. Not too much, not too small. Had a chocolate mousse bar-like dessert that was also incredible. Just the right amount of sweetness. I can't wait to return for another five star experience!",

My wife has a Fresco 1926 cocktail (sort of a vodka gimlet with red wine floated on top) and it was a tasty as it was delicious. I had a Dark & Stormy and mine was also perfect.  We then settled in for the Pepperoni/sausage pizza. The pepperonis were the little ones that turn into little cups of moist pepperoni goodness and the sausage was house-ground. They were delicious toppings, but what really brought it all the way home was the cornmeal crust. Making the crust with cornmeal on the bottom actually allows the pizza to ride above the oven surface and let air under it while it cooks, making for a wonderful, crispy delicious crust. Add it all together and the pizza was outstanding. We were so thrilled to find this pizza, and we are definitely coming back.  That's when things really took an unexpected turn. We ordered the zeppoli's. If I told you this was one of the best things I ever ate, that's no lie. These ethereal balls of dough, fried and coated with powdered sugar are light as a feather. You split them with a fork, and then grab a half and stick it into this amazing salted caramel dipping sauce. This was just CRAZY good. If nothing else, go there and try this dessert. You will never regret it.  To sum it up, we found excellent pizza, not an easy find in Charlotte. But we found the best dessert ever in the bargain. And a great mixologist to boot. Five stars goes to the places that give me something I'ver never had before or can't get anywhere else. The zeppoli's and Ross puts Stagioni's in that five star category. We are GOING back!",

    "text": "Bruce Moffett knows how to create a good restaurant with outstanding menu items. All pastas are House-made and you can tell within the initial bite. Ingredients are sourced locally and used to put modern spins on classic Italian dishes! And who doesn't love complimentary warm bread and fresh olive oil to start out the night? The ambiance is absolutely lovely, cozy, and quaint.  The Squash Blossoms appetizer is to die for!! The blossoms are battered in Prosecco, and stuffed with a three cheese + herb blend, and sit atop radish aioli and espelette.   The pastas are divine! If you're a mushroom lover like me, the Truffle Tagliatelle is a great choice! It comes with Porcini Mushrooms, a vermouth butter sauce, truffle pecorino, and shaved truffles. The portion size is just right, too!  The pizzas are nice and thin, with a good crisp to them. They're famous pizza is the Asparagus pizza.   The wines are great, even with such a moderate list.",

All their pizzas and pastas are homemade so I would def recommend sharing both because just ordering one or the other is too hard of a choice. The pizza comes with shears for cutting so be responsible...it's a big job. I can't let my girlfriend cut them anymore after last night's fiasco haha. Glad I got my pictures prior to that! Make sure you book a reservation and come hungry! Esp leave room for dessert...the zeppoli are heavenly. They are these pillowy balls of dough that you can dip into caramel sauce. Soo sooo good!!",

The food was all delicious and the service was some of the best we've ever had in Charlotte. A cool feature with the pizzas is cutting them yourself with giant scissors that are surprisingly much easier to use than a regular pizza cutter!  We started with the octopus (delicious even for the one person in our party who doesn't normally love octopus!), meatballs which were clearly made fresh recently, two pizzas, grilled parsnips (unique and delicious in a great pesto sauce), grilled cauliflower, and two pasta dishes. Would definitely recommend getting a bunch of plates like this and sharing, you will definitely leave very full! Pair it all with some creative and flavorful (and very flavor forward) seasonal cocktails and you'll have an amazing night out!",

It's the perfect small group dinner place, perfect date night spot! It's dark, it's cozy; perfectly intimate without being quiet or pretentious. 9 out of 10 time the service has been excellent, and 10 out of 10 times the food has exceeded expectations. Yes, it's a little pricey... but you really are getting what you pay for in terms of quality. You almost always need a reservation, and for the weekends I'd recommend you book ahead. You can't go wrong picking from the menu, but I usually end up getting at least one of the specials, and let's just say, it's always pretty special. The pizzas are on point, and my favorite is probably the Tartufi (think mushroomy... truffley goodness)  If you haven't been to this gem of a restaurant yet, now's probably a good time to give it a try!",

This is the best Italian food I've EVER had and I've been to some of the best in NY, San Fran, Houston, New Orleans etc. The pizza dough is homemade, the sauce is homemade, the pasta - yep, from frick'n SCRATCH people!   I'll be in Charlotte next weekend and hitting this joint again my friends!!!  What a find!  Go here and your welcome!  I've now dined at this restaurant close to 10 times. I've had their amazing pizza and many entrees and appetizers from their menu. Tonight was the first time I felt slighted. I ordered the squash blossom appetizer and pepperoni pizza. Squash blossoms were a total home run as they have always been. The pizza arrived with pepperoni AND sausage that I did not order. They quickly apologized and it wasn't too long presented me with a pepperoni pizza that was dripping in grease. So much grease that the grease and cheese produced an emulsification that looked a little like an oil spill. Really disappointed because I KNOW this isn't their standard. I normally would have pointed it out but we'd already had the sausage mishap and it's already been a long 4 days on the road you know.   I will be back tomorrow to have an entree and expect to be back on track with what I know is a great restaurant.",

We ordered: the zucchini blossoms and the octopus for apps and the ravioli with the farm egg, the lamb agnolotti, the gnocchi for dinner and the orange honey butter cake and gelloti/sorbetti for dessert. Everything was phenomenal. I would say the three things that stood out to me to most were the ravioli with that egg and that amazing brown butter sauce, then the octopus and lastly that orange cake! Would highly recommend all three if you go. And in general I'd just highly recommend go here!!!! I myself can't wAit to go back!",

Perfectly charred with nice and crispy potatoes. The mussels were also really good and flavorful. My husband ordered the lamb tortellini...delicious! Lamb is one of our favorites and this didn't disappoint. I ordered the lamb pizza (lol) and the lamb sausage was uber flavorful. Gooey cheese and thin-ish crust. Love! We will definitely go back.",

    "text": "A friend recommended that we try Stagioni's for a fun night out. We went on a Saturday, and if you go I highly recommend getting a reservation. Over the phone they said our party of 5 would be a tight fit, but when we arrived we had a prime spot towards the front of the kitchen which was amazing because you can see all of your food being prepared. The building has a cozy front bar area and opens up into a romantic dining room with warm lighting. I'd highly recommend this place for a date night.   After pouring over the menu, our troop couldn't hardly make any decisions on what to eat. We ended up leaving most of the deciding up to our server which was a great choice! She picked some unique meats and cheese for us to try on a charcuterie board. The house-made capicola and bresaola were two of our favorites.  PRO TIP: When you're ordering dinner, put in your order for the special Zeppoli fried \"doughnuts.\" They are heavenly and can take a moment to be prepared. My friend who recommended this spot ordered these first and at the conclusion of our meal we were so glad she did. Piping hot fried little pieces of dessert heaven.  Next it was a pizza to split, because we saw a few coming out around us and we couldn't pass it up. It came out with pizza shears which were interesting (though probably not the most functional). We tried the Broccoli pizza which was a great unique combination of broccoli, mozzarella, and chili oil. I also remember they had a pepperoni pizza that sounded amazing and a brussels sprout pizza. The dough tasted so homemade and fresh. If I were to go back, I'd definitely try another one of their creations.   For dinner I settled on the scallop and pasta dish of the evening. I love ordering seafood out at fine dining restaurants since I tend to cook more chicken and turkey at home. The scallops were buttery and the pasta was perfection. Everything melted in my mouth.  Our waitress was so helpful and paired 2 bottles of wine with our meal that made us feel extra fancy. This is definitely a special occasion type place and I recommend that you come VERY hungry. Fit for foodies!",

I couldn't kill time at my office anymore... so I figured I'd just arrive early... The hostess (whose name I didn't catch, mea culpa!) was so sweet... I was about to offer to wait at the bar when she said that my table was ready... so off I went...  As I had plenty of time, I ordered the Alternative (a bourbon, muddled orange, cointreau cocktail that is their current spin on the Old Fashioned... made with Bulleit) while I browsed the wine list.  This drink is absolutely delicious, and perfect to whet the appetite!  We trickled in one by one and Jenny, our server, was beyond attentive to us, waiting patiently until we all arrived to run down the specials and additional menu items for us...  She was a GEM and we were so lucky to have her as our server last night!   SO... for the table, we ordered two bottles of a lovely Tuscan Cab Sauv (Tommasi poggio al tufo toscana cabernet sauvignon 2016 to be exact); a cheese tray with their extra buffalo milk cheese that was very much a brie style cheese and absolutely fabulous; and a plate of the Cacio e Pepe to share... I had already scarfed a side salad because I was starving...  I then ordered the small plate of duck leg with a butternut squash risotto AND the sweet potato gnocchi... and THEN (because why the hell not?) we shared the chocolate tartufo... holy hell... I could die happy!    The duck was crispy on the outside, hot and tender on the inside, and atop that gently sweet risotto it was heaven on a plate!  The gnocchi were little floofs (yes, floofs) of heaven surrounded by a spicy and cheesy sauce and warm earthy sausages... I just can't even with these people!  The food is TOO good.   Let me tell you more about the food here... orgasmic doesn't cover it... It's made with so much love and care that the devotion to their craft shines through EVERY bite.  The servers here operate on another level as well.   Their patience and graciousness makes me feel (with EVERY visit) that I've been welcomed into someone's home rather than a business... This restaurant has EARNED its reputation.  It is, in my opinion, one of Charlotte's finest.  You'll pay for your meal, you'll tip like a king.  You won't mind.  I promise you!",

Tonight a friend and I dined at Stagioni for the first time since it was close to where we took a gym class. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with no sausage and received a sausage pizza with no pepperoni. Not a big deal. The waiter was very apologetic and offered to swap it out, but since I had already started eating it I passed.  Before leaving I placed an order of the gnocchi to bring home to my husband and stupidly on my part I didn't check the box before leaving the restaurant. The attached picture is the gnocchi that was packaged up for me to go. As you can imagine after paying almost $30 for a dish I expected a little more than a few pieces... I'm actually mind blown by this.... was this someone else's to go food or is that really the restaurant portion? Unacceptable",

There menu is interesting, with unique proteins like rabbit. The service is warm. The cocktails are well crafted, the wine selection very diverse.  However, if I measure it dollar for dollar with similar establishments it is a case of Myers Park pricing. If someone else was paying this review would have an extra star. With my pocket book on the table I would go elsewhere.  Our waiter was divine, making us off menu cocktails based on our taste preferences. Recommending wine based on our feedback - and there is a value to that. At the end of the night my husband left hungry after an app and a very meaty entree. No one wants a hangry husband.",

    "text": "Got really excited when I heard this place had the same ownership as Good Food on Montford as that is my True favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Also knowing the lack of Italian restaurants in this city, I figured I would have visited this place by now.  I really like the location and was surprised to find they even had ample parking around back and the design and ambiance inside really brings sets the scene for a modern, upscale family run traditional Italian feel.  First off I'd really like to compliment the cocktail list, I had the Vespa which is a brandy drink and it was one of my all-time favorites.  Couldn't recommend this more if you are a cocktail type.  As far as food goes, I really will need to go again as I only had the pizza and dessert but both were fantastic.  I really like this place as a special occasion type and I would say my only complaint is that its a little pricey for the portion sizes from what I observed.  However, with all this place has to offer from both food and dining experiences, many people including myself, will be back because it worth the price in many ways.  Will return.  Food: 8.5/10 Drinks:  10/10 Ambiance: 10/10 Price: 4/10 Service: 8/10 Value: 6/10",

    "text": "I've been to Stagioni several times and somehow, this restaurant has managed to knock it out of the party Every...Single...Time. The ambiance is so cozy, from the dim lights to the warmth coming from the kitchen. When you walk in, the first thing you see is the bar area. Walk a little further in to see a mid size dining room with an open kitchen in the back.  I went here on a First Dinner Date with my boo. Apparently drinks went so well the week before that he decided to go big or go home by booking an impressive reso at Stagioni. Since then, we've been on several other dates and group dinners here. It's just lively enough where you get a bottle of wine and have a great time, while being just quiet enough to hear each other.   Honestly, I recommend the whole menu. Their pizza is delicious, the pastas are fresh, and the main courses are perfectly packed with flavor. There isn't one thing on their menu that isn't well thought out and amazing.  If you haven't been yet, I recommend making a reso ASAP!",

I would have given the review 4 stars except for the fact they charged me $31 for a pasta dish with clams (rec'd 6) and each clam was the size of an aspirin. I didn't know a clam could be that tiny, it was so small I couldn't chew it or taste it. The pasta was fresh & sauce was good so basically the microscopic clams ruined the dish for me.",

Quickly I was very excited to meet a close local friend and her precocious daughter, who's manners are above reproach.  Ironically her father is a \"name\" in Charlotte hospitality but names do not matter, every well mannered customer is entitled to gracious service!  It was one of those bitter New York frigid days, we both got there about 5:15 and were waiting patiently outside for the 5:30 open.  About 5:20 a delivery person knocked on the locked door, a dressed gentleman opened the door for him, looked at us, closed the door and locked it.   We were both just astounded and left for some where more welcoming.",

    "text": "This restaurant was an extreme disappointment. My husband and I have been wanting to try it since the reviews have been good and we love their sister restaurant, Good Food. It was also not easy to get a reservation last minute so we assumed a hot spot would not disappoint. The highlight of the experience was the wine. I ordered three different glasses of red and all were delicioius. Our waitress was friendly but she obviously had too many tables. The food was extremely slow from one course to the next. We waited at least 20-25 minutes between our appetizer and entree. We ordered the stuffed peppers as a snack. They were edible but nothing special, we wouldn't order them again. I had the pumpkin soup as my appetizer and my husband had the fig tart special. The pumpkin soup was good but I expected it to be thicker and more hearty. The fig tart was o.k. but heavy for an appetizer and over-priced. My husband ordered the $30 pasta entree special with truffle mushrooms. In the 4 years we've been dining together, we have never sent an entree back to the kitchen. This was an exception. The pasta literally had zero flavor. It tasted like noodles with a little butter that you would serve to a 5 year old. The waitress happily switched his dish for the rigatoni, which was just as bad. The pasta was cooked just fine but the small amount of sauce served over the dish was watery and flavorless. I ordered the trout. It lacked flavor and the portion was definitley small for the price. All in all I would give this restaurant a 2 out of 10 based on the wine. $150 and we left still hungry. We will NOT be back.",

    "text": "We arrived shortly before 7:00 and grabbed a seat at the bar.  The bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  After checking over the menu we decided to try the charcuterie plate, a mixed array of meats, cheeses, etc.  However, unfortunately we received the special plate which was a little bit of an array of things that we were unfamiliar with, and no one gave us an explanation upon delivery. We tasted a few things, but unfortunately the chicken liver mouse and some of the other things, still not sure what they were, not to our liking. We explained the mix up and we were able to replace it with a plate of prosiutto de parma, mortadella, and variety of cheeses and olives, more what we were looking for. We also chose the swordfish appetizer which was served with crostini  and was pretty good. Finally we went with the margarita pizza, which was probably the best thing we had the entire night. Unfortunately throughout the evening the bartender was less available, leaving us with empty drinks for quite some time.  Overall, I thought the food we tried was good, and I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, However, I was a little disappointed with the overall service and attentiveness to delivery of our meals. I do look forward to going back, sitting in the restaurant and trying some more entrees, especially the pasta. It looked great.",

We had a few of the appetizers, ..Fried Clam Strips...good tasting batter but very Chewy! Shisitto Peppers that were the bomb!! So good,  fresh grilled and dusted with flaky sea salt! Mushrooms that were ..just okay.  On to the Wine...all bottles extremely expensive..very hard to pick between a 42 and 38 when all the rest  jump up to 50 - 60 and on up.. They really should change this and put in a few less expensive wines..Entrees are very high..starting with Pastas for 18.00 and Up and they are small portions. I had the Carmalized Onion and Truffle Oil Pizza. It was good but very sweet, like it was a Onion Jam on the top. Some of our party had the Grouper ( 30.00) and liked it. Others had the Gnocchi with Pork Sugo and said it was delicious.  Best part of the evening was the Zeppole. Perfect , light and fresh ! .The other winners was the Peach skillet cake. .. I would go back for dessert and  perhaps a coffee...non was offered to us. Also no Parm...whats an Italian place without Parm????",

The Staff came over to our table immediately and served us water and warm bread while we looked over the menus.  The Decor puts you in the mind of Tuscany and is very appeasing to the eye. The intricate details gives your eye something new to explore at all times.  The Kitchen is open to the restaurant so you are able to get a peak at all of the delicious food that is coming out! The best thing about all the pastas and breads are that they are made in house!  Being that I was with a Group of Friends we decided to order an array of different dishes and drinks to do tastings. We order the Meatball Pizza, Rigatoni, Steak Florentine, and my all time favorite the Mushroom Risotto!! It was so good! We topped everything off with the tiramisu cheesecake it will not disappoint!!!   I would say this is a Great Place for Date Night and socializing with friends! Be sure to make reservations early this place fills up quick.",

Even offered to take a photo of us when they saw us attempting a self-timer shot outside.   We started with an octopus appetizer, which was delicious. So tender, and a great mix of flavors.   My husband ordered the pesce fresco which was grouper. I ordered the cannelloni with lamb bolognese. Both were fresh, interesting takes on the dishes. I expected ground lamb but it was finely shredded. The cannelloni was a rich dish, but so flavorful!   I only wish we'd had room for dessert. I heard the fried bread dipped in caramel sauce is excellent. Speaking of bread, I ate way too much of it prior to our food arriving. So so good.   Also loved the atmosphere.

She asked for my price range which was kind of awkward and I said $50-$60 and she answered with this price range you won't have that many good option. ;-( which I thought it was kind of disrespectful. So she finally chose one of them which was exactly $60.  My wine was smooth and fruity ,NOT BOLD,  NOT DRY. our waitress just open the wine and filled our glasses and that was the only time she served us and we poured the entire bottle in our glasses since she did not notice our glasses were low.

    "text": "I was fortunate to try Stagioni on one of the \"Friends and Family\" opening nights and I liked it so much that I went back 2 nights later!  In fact I was scoping out the menu on that first night and figuring out that whatever we didn't order that night I would just get on my next trip in.  For me there was never a question of not liking this place, Barrington's and Good Food are my favorite restaurants in Charlotte and I knew this place was going to be on par, if not better because its Italian and I LOVE Italian food!!  The design really is beautiful, from the floors, to the bathroom chandelier, to the cool picture spread out over the dining room ceiling, you can tell a lot of work went into making this place look good.  But the most important part, the food and drinks!  I have only had beer and wine so far, prosecco on tap, how cool is that??  I like that there is a whole section of spreads, my favorite was the ricotta, I could have licked the bowl clean but that would have been inappropriate so I stopped myself.  The red pepper and truffled cauliflower are good too, but the ricotta is just so creamy and light.    Arancini were delish, but how can you mess up fried balls of rice?  The braciole was another standout, as was the meatball pizza, the brodetto and the fettuccine.  But my new favorite thing in the whole world is the stracci, seriously I have been telling anyone who will listen to order this dish.  It was homemade ribbon pasta, huge shrimp, and pistachios in a light tomato saffron broth.  It was so amazing we were all fighting over who got to finish this dish.  I know I am missing some things but I am sure you get the point, pretty much everything its delicious.  Finally, dessert.  They have the pear skillet cake on their menu that Good Food used to have, its served with avocado ice cream and some salted caramel and its truly one of the most unique and delicious desserts I've ever eaten.  I was so sad when GF took it off their menu so I was very happy to see it here.  I also tried the zeppoli's and they were different than other zeppoli's I have had, much lighter so I almost felt like I was being healthy (haha) but still very good.  Overall, I was very impressed with Stagioni.  Usually when a restaurant is brand new you expect to have a lot of issues with food and service but I had 2 great experiences and plan on going back again this week, I mean a girl can only go so long without her stracci!!",

A member of our party who typically chooses the wine even made a comment about how helpful she was.   After drinks we made our way the the table and ordered a huge charcuterie board filled with meats and cheeses. Nothing disappointed. Next was the meatballs the Brussel sprouts pizza. I was conflicted on the pizza but soooo glad we tried it. I would easily recommended it if it's on the menu if you visit.   For mains we had a split between pastas and meats. All were amazing.   You get the idea that the food is good but I really would focus on the customer service here. The waitstaff was so accommodating and we never had to ask for anything, they were always one step ahead. The food came quick and was always hot and the staff would check on multiple occasions is the food was prepared properly and if our table required anything. For only being open 4 months, that's impressive.   Definitely check this place out. It will not disappoint.",

My girlfriend got the lamb rigatoni, which was amazing!  So freaking good, I would recommend it for anyone.  The atmosphere of the place is nice, but it got really loud in there as dinner progressed- guess it's just a small place that everything echoes.  Service was decent, but our server vanished in the middle of the meal; fortunately, nothing was wrong with our dishes, but I feel like it's standard for someone to stop by and check.

    "text": "We came here a few weeks ago.  Overall, it was pretty good and we would go back again.  We started with the crostini and choices of spreads, all pretty decent.  I had the brussel sprout pizza sans the meat and it was pretty good.  Although, it could use maybe a little more depth in flavor when the meat isn't present.  I have to applaud them for being creative enough to use parsnip puree as the sauce.  My husband tried the agnolotti and he said it was pretty good. As a side note, I really didn't dig the decor.  It just didn't seem to all go together.  I didn't deduct any points for this, but I wasn't impressed at all by it.",

Who knew there was a mini castle tucked away on Providence rd. in Charlotte, NC!!   I feel my life has seriously changed!   The ambience is dim and perfect for intimate groups. Very warm cozy and small. Reservations highly recommend for weekend dining. Unless you can score seats at the pizza oven bar which is first come first serve.   Decor was not what I was expecting but who cares when you're drinking wine and eating great food with great company.   I ordered the gnocchi and it was to die for. Warm and fresh but also light and comforting. It was one of the pasta dishes with protein. Pork to be exact.  Honestly if I was having a bad day I could just come here and it would turn my frown upside down!!",

    "text": "Visited Stagioni with my parents and was wowed by the creativity of the dishes, the flavor and service. Our waiter was super attentive and gave us recommendations in each section of the menu - all of which were extremely solid since we ordered some of his recos. I had the tartufi pizza, which comes with its own set of scissors to cut into slices. So fun and effective. The pizza was slightly sweet from the bed of caramelized onions on the crust, layered with fresh mozzarella and tons of wild mushrooms and a generous swirl of truffle oil that adds a delicious earthy flavor to the pizza. My parents ordered the truffles cauliflower to start - a delicious and rich dip served with paper thin crackers. Highly recommend. My dad ordered the Caesar salad, which was gently dressed with the most aromatic croutons. My mom then ordered the cavatelli - short cut, curled pasta with lots of veggies and a light sauce. Really lovely. My dad ordered the spaghetti with scallops and literally cleaned his plate. Everything was delicious. We can't wait to come back here as soon as possible and try everything else on the menu! Maybe tomorrow...!",

Russ was as attentive and friendly as is possible on a busy Saturday night. It seemed like the kitchen was either unprepared or understaffed. That said, what finally made it to our table was worth the wait. We had the Buratta and a Ceasar salad. Both were quite good. But the Prosciutto Pizza we shared for our main was phenomenal. Interestingly enough, between the wonderful food and the quite European service, we felt like we were back in Italy!  If you want plenty of time to put down your cell phone and talk with your dinner mate, this is a great spot. If your planning a first date and allocating an hour, not so much. We like to talk to each other and we love good Italian food, so we'll be back.",

    "text": "Let me explain for my slightly harsh review. I had super high expectations of this place because of heir sister restaurant, Good Food on Montford, which happens to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I think the Muffett Group have what it takes and can take a critic or two from a fan to give them the push  The decor itself bothers me. I can't put my finger on it. The tables are so close together I almost took a spoonful of my right hand diners risotto.   I love Prosecco and they happen to have have it on tap, sounds awesome right? It did To me too until I had it. It tastes like Brut rather than Prosecco, it was dry not sweet but I love bubbles so that wasn't entirely a complaint (drank it with ease).   I am convinced that The fried chickpeas are dehydrated and not made in house but unexpected so I give them that. However all the other antipastos aka appetizers we had fell short. I happened to really enjoy the Brussel Sprout Pizza, so unexpectedly delicious.   I ordered the veal saltimbocca was so disappointing. While my first few bites I really wanted to like it , the veal was really thin, then followed a layer of cheese and a layer of prosciutto- all this on top was amazing it over powered the veal. The creamy polenta was fantastic though.   I have tried to make it a point to only try desserts that are either a staple to the origin of the food served or if it sounds out of the norm...so I tried the Zeppolis which were an airy delight! I also tried the Pear Skilet Cake with Avocado ice cream , sounds amazing right? Yes but individually, not sure of they paired. Why not a salted cartelized bacon in the avocado ice cream? Just not with that cake. I leave it to them to fix.   Let me touch on service. The bread with olive oil was served while we were almost done with our appetizers , really? However our service hosts themselves were very friendly.  All in all, I'm hoping for a change to come the spring/summer. I hope I won't be disappointed, again.",

    "text": "Kudos to the the owner for bringin' in an amazing new Chef! One of the most romantic compliments someone can get, is when another person sees a picture and simply states: There are no words. This food is like that.   Of course, I'll find some words, or else this would be a pointless review, right? And oh my, will there be words. I'm about to do some ramblin'!  We'll start with the starters. From their antipasto menu, we were blessed with the flavors of the Caprese and the Italian Sausage Crustini. Now, I have had my fair share of \"caprese salads\" as I love fresh mozzarella. But this was not only visually beautiful, but absolute flavor perfection. There were several varieties of tomatoes, each with their own flavor notes along with the perfect vinaigrette that was poignantly sweet and tart. This was all accented with mozzarella foam. Now, anything with the word 'foam' usually turns me off, as I'm not a gastro-food pro, however, this was exactly what this antipasto needed. Anything more would have thrown off the balance of this exquisite salad.  The Italian Sausage Crustini came out, and we thought of some sort of dank hot dog, however we were more than pleasantly surprised. The bread was light and fluffy and the sausage was not overpowering or heavy, but had the slightest hint of heat and pepper, all accented with a lovely sweet pepper sauce (which has a fancier name, but I can't remember it just now) that tied everything into a taste bud orgasm.  We also were honored with two specials for the evening, which may not be available for you when you go, and you should feel sad if they aren't. Fried squash blossoms stuffed with mascarpone and heaven, and a gazpacho that would rival a fine wine as it had notes of cucumber, melon and summer.  We decided on pasta entrees as we'd heard that the pasta is made in-house (and it's an Italian place). We had Agnolotti and the Spaghetti. Though I've never been to Italy, these entrees made me think that this is what I would be eating while dining on some patio overlooking the sea. Pasta that wasn't overloaded and heavy, but simply made you joyous while you chewed. The Spaghetti was served with little neck clams in a light angelic white wine sauce, and the Agnolotti? Oh. My. God. I am often wary of lobster, as so many chefs choose to use it, and so many chefs send out lobster that's rubbery and chewy. This lobster melted in my mouth. And the pasta was stuffed with, hold onto your seats folks, this amazing corn concoction...and I believe crack. Because I couldn't stop eating it. I was SO full, but my fork just kept moving because it was the perfect sweetness to go with the lobster, all in a light sauce that held the perfect hint of saltiness to blend the flavors into...well, that crack concoction I was referring to.  We didn't need dessert. We truly didn't, however the Zeppoli was 'forced' upon us, and we grudgingly acquiesced knowing at this point, that it would be amazing. And we were not disappointed. Light clouds of fried bread dusted with powdered sugar with a semi-sweet caramel dipping sauce. And...for once,...I simply don't have the words. When thinking about it, I just smile.  Everything we ate made us make noises that bordered on sexual bliss. I hate to call myself a \"foodie\" because I hate those people, but I eat a lot of good food in a lot of good restaurants, but this was simply a treat for our taste buds. And the service needs to be mentioned, as it was impeccable (ask for Jack). No empty plate lingered on our table, nor were we ever lacking anything, and he 'touched' the table with perfect timing. If you like to eat wonderfulness, and simply going to a place that's going to leave you longing for more, than this is definitely the place for you.  Bravo Chef Dodd! Well done. Very, very well done.",

Stagioni is located in the cutest flat building that contains concrete columned walkways with intentionally chipped paint.  I just wish there were more nighttime things to do here because it would be the perfect romantic date spot.   As for the inside, the best description I can think of is \"upscale hipster\". The decorations are cozy with mixes between metals and wood, the light is dim, and most impressively: every single waiter had on a chambray shirt and nicely groomed beards. Props to Stagioni for finding these gentlemen with such hair growing talents.    The food was awesome. From appetizer to dessert, I couldn't stop myself from chowing down everything in front of me.  The menu changes but as of now, I'd recommend mussels for appetizer and short rib for entree. Let me tell you, those mussels are expensive but well damn worth that price tag.  But honestly in general Stagioni isn't unaffordable. We paid 80$ for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and dessert. And we left completely stuffed like two turkeys on Thanksgiving.   Lastly, don't expect parking unless you come early (like 6ish). The lot is small and spots are very limited, especially when it's busy.",

    "text": "What do you do when you're the creative mind behind two of Charlotte's most celebrated restaurants and the winner of multiple awards? Thats right... you open another one. Bruce Moffett (the man behind Barrington's and Good Food on Montford) is a James Beard nominated chef, was named \"Restaurateur of the Year\" by Charlotte Magazine, graduated from the Culinary Institute of America with Honors, and has worked at L'Espalier and Metropolis Cafe. Before becoming one of Charlotte's most well known chefs, Bruce Moffett graduated from the University of Rhode Island for Political Science, moved to Washington, DC and spent six years working for US Senator John Chafee. Now he's opened Stagioni and the anticipation has been steadily growing since it was announced.  Stagioni is set in the Historic Reynolds-Gourmajenko in Charlotte's prestigious Myers Park neighborhood. The building... wait... let me correct... the Mansion was Charlotte's first Tuscan Villa, it featured a Mediterranean inspired walled courtyard and its roof is made of antique cuban tiles. The setting gets a huge A+ from us and its easily one of the most beautiful restaurants we've ever seen... until you get inside.  The inside is suppose to be a take on Italian elegance that pays homage to the homes history. Most of the interior decor was on point (especially the open kitchen design) but we've got to call them out on all of the \"red touches\" placed throughout. The red doesn't look elegant... it looks like something better suited in a $20 brothel. There are red glass votive candle holders on the table, red sconces on the wall, red lamps in the kitchen, etc... and they need to go. Its not so much the design as it is the color. If they were perhaps a little more Mediterranean and a lot less Ferrari I think they would be perfect. Maybe one of the colors from Design Seeds?  With that rant out of the way we can get back to business.  Once seated we were attentively waited on by the staff and after a quick look at the menu we were ready to get our grub on. I'm (Curtis) not usually very adventurous when it comes to trying foods from the weird category, especially weird seafood. But on this night I was feeling pretty damn frisky so I kicked off the night by trying the Grilled Octopus with Pickled Onion, Olive Oil, and Lemon. Ella played it safe and ordered the Arancini aka Stuffed Risotto Balls (theres nothing we like more than cheese stuffed fried balls).   The octopus was plated beautifully and all of the accompaniments were seriously on point. As far as the octopus goes, well it was my first tangle with the eight legged sea creature and I didn't hate it at all. It reminded me a lot of shrimp, a little chewy like a bouncy ball, a little weird, and not anything I think I will be craving late at night. Ella's stuffed balls were easily the favorite antipasto and we could have made a meal of just balls if we had order more.  For our entrees we both stuck to our favorites and I got the Steak Florentine with Spinach, Garlic, Lemon, and a side of Polenta. Ella got the Gnocchi with Mushrooms, Peas, Prosciutto, and cream. To be completely honest I was pretty disappointed in my steak. It didn't come out medium-rare, it tasted as plain as a piece of meat could taste, and when compared to e2 Emeril's Eatery 16oz Painted Hills Rib Eye served with a salad of arugula, fennel, oven dried tomato and housemade worcestershire sauce... it just seems like a waste of money and steak. Instead of going for the spinach I spent my time savoring Stagioni's creamy polenta, it needed some cheese but it was still one of my favorite dishes of the night.   Ella ultimately decided to go with the gnocchi because she has had it several times at Good Food on Montford and thoroughly enjoyed it. She was pleased to see that the recipe had not changed. The gnocchi was light and fluffy and paired perfectly with the sweet peas and salty prosciutto.  No night is complete without dessert so we flagged down our server and after a couple seconds we placed our dessert order. I decided I might have better luck trying something weird than sticking with something safe so I went for the pear skillet cake served with caramel sauce, whipped cream and avocado ice cream. I was really exited to try the avocado ice cream, but found myself disappointed. I missed the avocado flavor completely and in the end it was really just green vanilla ice cream. The cake had a really nice texture and good flavor, I just wish it had more pears.   Ella got the apricot panna cotta served with dried cherries  and a pistachio cookie (I ended up with dessert envy). The panna cotta was perfectly smooth, rich and flavorful. The accompaniments worked perfectly with the dessert adding crunch from the cookie and a sweet sourness from the cherries.  Stagioni was mostly a great restaurant and perhaps with more time it will match the level of Bruce's other creations.",

    "text": "Stagioni has become one of my favorite, go-to restaurants in Charlotte. I love the seasonal menu and their new, innovative offerings every few months! Their food is reasonably priced - while entrees range from $25-$35, they also have lower priced options like pizzas and pastas.   If you order anything, order the duck. Every seasonal iteration I've tasted has been supremely delicious, to the point where I can't bring myself to order anything else. It is always perfectly prepared and complemented by the rest of the dish. Last night it included multi-grain risotto and duck confit - so delicious I would have just ordered that on its own!   Perfect for date night or a low key work dinner, Stagioni is definitely worth a visit.",

A perfect atmosphere, intimate and cozy, with an open kitchen, which is where we chose to sit to watch the staff work their brilliance.  We started with the Tartufi pizza which comes with caramelized onions, fontina, arugula and truffle oil. It was to die for. Then followed it up with the Carbonara - I have no words.  The staff was informative, and friendly - Even the company around us. Everyone seemd delighted, and I thoroughly enjoyed catching that occasional \"yeah, we know what's up\", satisfied glance.  Highly recommended, and I think the perfect date place! Bravo Stagioni.",

    "text": "It only took about 5 visits for me to concede... I just can't get enough.  The food, vibe, and service are absolutely fantastic and at a reasonable pricepoint.  There are numerous places in Charlotte that are absolutely overrated and charge far too much for their fare.  This is not the case.    The menu is often changing and keeps it fresh.  It's always fun and a great place to celebrate or just have a nice casually romantic dinner with your love.  I highly recommend the charcuterie, pizzas, short rib, fish options, and of course... the zeppole (one of the greatest desserts in Charlotte)  It's one of the only places in Charlotte that I can recommend, rave, and pump up and feel extremely confident that it will live up to my recommendation.",

    "text": "Ah, what to say about Stagioni? I can preface my review by saying that I am not usually a fan of Italian food, or more precisely the same old tired Italian food. Looking at the menu before making a reservation, I was already salivating and torn on what to order. My friend had already been there for drinks and suggested that we park out back, because the majority of the parking is out back off Fenton Place with only a few spots out front on Providence.  We were greeted warmly and sat immediately in front of the open kitchen. There are even 6-8 seats with a closer view of the kitchen in a straight bar type set up. Our server was on the spot to take drink orders, drop off bread and go over the menu with the group, including specials. I was expecting a slightly larger dining area and a more formal dress, but neither was the case and also neither was a problem. As the evening went on, there seemed to be a more formal dressed crowd, but overall it was a relaxed atmosphere and the dining room did not feel cramped.  Now onto the food, we started with some sputini or snacks which in this case were small portions to share. The group of four chose 5 different options to include chicken skin, truffled cauliflower, pickled veggies, house made ricotta and mortadella mousse. My standout was the mortadella mousse, just imagine spreadable mortadella. No one really liked the chicken skins as they were not really seasoned, even the person that really wanted to order them was disappointed. They weren't bad tasting but just under seasoned. The other 3 were great and very flavorful. When the snacks arrived, I ask our server for the clam and mussel pizza for the table to share, as I had forgot to order it the first go around. It came out quickly and it was pipping hot. It also came with a pair of pizza scissors for me to use. Well there is a first time for everything and they worked great to cut the pizza. The pizza had cauliflower puree as the sauce and topped with bacon and the aforementioned clams and mussels. It was delicious and I can easily see coming here just for drinks and their inventive pizzas.  On to the mains, 2 people, including myself had the grouper special which came with ramps and a ramp pesto. The fish was cooked to perfection and all the flavors blended together well. The other 2 diners, including the wife chose some house made pastas. Now the fish was good, but the pastas were out of this world good. It brought me back to my first trip to Italy over 20 years ago. Needless to say that next time, I am getting a pasta dish for my main. The pastas chosen were the rigatoni and triangle shaped goat cheese stuffed ravioli. For dessert, we went with buffet and by that I mean that we all chose one and we all shared. The cannoli were great in my mind as well as the raspberry gelato and pistachio gelato. The pear skillet cake was just alright and for me the zeppoli were not my thing, but everyone else at the table loved them. I think that they are just not in my flavor profile.  If you are wondering what we had to drink, nothing really stood out as far as the cocktails that we had. They have an extensive wine list that may be your best bet. I did find that the cocktails and deserts were a little pricy compared to the food. Either way, the food was fantastic overall and maybe we will try some wine next time. The few minor things that weren't perfect like the chicken skin and cocktails don't take away from a 5 star experience and I look forward to an evolving seasonal menu. After all, stagioni means season in Italian and I will hold them to that. It could also mean not the same old tired Italian food as well.",

I parked in the adjoining parking lot. Stagioni is decorated in the Italian country style.  I love the use of wood, and we were given large, cloth napkins, reminiscent of beautiful dish towels.  All I could hear was happy diners until I visited the ladies' room.  Frank was blasting, in a good way.  I wish I was able to hear this music in the dining room.  It would have added to the ambiance. We were given bread in paper bags, along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I don't eat bread except for special occasions.  When I tasted these rolls, that is all I wanted.  I had two and don't regret a single bite. I ordered three sides:  spinach, creamy polenta, and wood fired mushrooms.  The plentiful portions were cooked and seasoned just perfectly.  The polenta could have been frozen and turned into a savory ice cream.  It was just that creamy. We finished with a shot of limoncello.  A refreshing ending to a fabulous meal.",
