Love to see a smaller restaurant like this deliver and I'm going to be honest they have the BEST buffalo chicken pizza I have ever had. That chicken is soooooo much better than any other pizza chain I have tried before! Highly recommend to anyone if you are craving some pizza and wings!",

The salads use to be really good but now you pay around $10.00 for a tray of iceburg lettuce with hardly any toppings, your lucky to get two small slices of tomatoes, two slices of cucumbers, I ordered a chicken salad and it probably has one small tender on top that is sliced thin. Oh and make sure you order extra ranch because it only comes with a 2oz dressing, not even enough to disperse on your salad. The service has really went downhill in the past few years and this use to be our go to spot for lunch. :(",

I  referred a group of my co workers to try TLC for our lunch break being from Upstate NY I love TLC wings and I feel like they remind of the part of New York that I am missing... when I called to place a nice sized order for delivery I was instantly greeted with horrible customer service still wanting to place the order.. I was bluntly placed on hold and was under the impression they did not want to take my order for delivery asking questions with  attitudes and frustrations  ... Asking to speaking   with a manger after the conversation with the employee the manger did not show any sympathy and canceled the order... It really is disappointing because I talked so highly of the business and every time my family  comes from New York we eat at TLC... sorry but they will never  get any of my money and those honey hot wings be so good....  I am so disappointed I never write reviews... but I have referred so many people to you guys... treat your loyal  customers the right way ... now  my employees never want to order there as well.... Guess we will try another wing spot.....I am sure the owner does not operate his business like this....",

I'm selective when it comes to wing sauce, and favor the vinegar based \" tangy\" sauces. TLC's \"Red Tang\"sauce it my favorite. Just the right amount of heat for me. For those of you who love to show off how hot you can stand it, there is a hotter sauce. I know this because it's called \"X-tra\" hot.  The inside of the restaurant is small and basic. The young lady who runs the register is very congenial and is quick to tell repeat customers how much she appreciates them. I order all \"drummies\" and the amount of meat on each one of those is more than just about any other wing place that I've tried, however \"Sticky Fingers\" (Ballantyne) has the same amount of meat as \"TLC\".",

    "text": "I reviewed TLC back in Feb., and you can read that one for yourself. I complained about the attitude and attention given the customers which was so bad I didn't want to go back. If I can speak plainly about their faults, then when they do good, I feel it should be noted as well. I've been several times now here in Sep. and Oct., and the teenagers are gone. There's an adult running the kitchen now, and a mature, helpful person on the register, and I'd like to think my earlier review had something to do with making these changes. The wings are still the best around, and now its a treat to go in and pick up some delicious wings (which are done when promised), and promptly be served, waited on, and out the door in a hurry. I don't try many flavors because the terriaki is just the BOSS, but my wife likes the honey BBQ, and I'm sure the rest are equally good. The problems seem to be worked out on the service, and their wings were always the best, so I can recommend that you even go out of your way to try the wings at TLC, and feel confident in saying you won't be disappointed!!",

I got my drink and sat down to wait for my food.  They had a football game on the flat screen TV.   It took about 20 minutes to get my food.  The sauce on the wings was very good, typical Buffalo style sauce.  The wings themselves were a little over cooked, but still OK.  The fries were good, but they put a seasoned salt on which I would have them leave off next time.  Overall this is a nice place and I would have given a more stars, but a 20 minute wait for 10 wings and fries is ridiculous.  My recommendation, skip eating in here and order your wings to go.",

She proceeds to say \"well the tomato won't even be touching the bread but okay\" the \"but okay\" is rude and sarcastic and how am I supposed to know how you lay your toppings on the sandwich ?!?! I order the food pick it up go home and try to eat the food. The veggie burger was burnt to a crisp tasted like burnt charcoal. DISGUSTING!! I call in and the lady (blonde chick) is super rude doesn't apologize at all or offer any alternatives.

However, TLC has definitely changed my affiliation with wings.  I normally get their honey bbq wings and the wings are cooked and sauced to perfection.  Any time I have the taste for wings...this is my go to spot.  I've tried other wings in the area, but nothing comes closer.",

    "text": "Ok so to be honest this was my first time eating from here because from the outside it doesn't look like a place I want to eat. After seeing such a professional website I decided to give it try. I tried to call to place my order at 1:15 and no one answered, so I ordered online at around 1:25pm and it alerted me that the order wouldn't be ready until 2:17 pm. I've worked in a place that served wings and I know they take less than 15 minutes to cook wings, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe there was a late lunch rush or something. When I arrived at 2:14 pm to pick the food up, the lady who worked there was sweeping and took a while to acknowledge me. It seemed like she was confused as to why someone was inside of this place and then asked why I was there. To which I told her about my online order. Mind you, I am the only person in this place and no one was in the kitchen. Just she and I. It didn't seem like there was a lot going on so it was funny that she had to ask about it and go \"check on it\" which apparently meant she had to go out back and tell the cook to come in and finish my order. So I'm guessing maybe that's why there was almost an hour wait for 10 wings. Didn't see him wash his hands, but who knows. In my combo I also get a drink which I wasn't given. I think they were hoping I would leave, but after asking if I got a drink she replied \"yep.\" I initially didn't see bad reviews of the food which is why I tried it , but after closer inspection I see other people have had similar experiences with service here. Your food is good, your website is great, your staff needs much improvement and help with customer service. The two stars are for the quality of the food only because the wings were delicious.",

    "text": "Our office recently placed an order from TLC Wings & Grill.  While they have a huge selection of wings and sauces,  I wasn't really in the mood for chicken wings.  Instead, I opted for the Chicken Parmesan sub ($5.29) with a side order of fries ($1.89).  The chicken parm sub wasn't the smartest  choice for a take-out -- by the time the food arrived, the sauce had sort of soaked into the bread and made it a bit squishy.   However, the flavor was very good and the portion size was huge (thankfully it was already cut in 2 - definitely enough for 2 meals!)  The fries were good, and they were very generous with the portion size of that as well.   I would definitely order this again, but probably not for take-out.   I would also recommend giving these guys a try if you are looking for good quality wings & fries at reasonable prices.",

Ranch and blue cheese paired well with it. I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "I had a great experience at TLC Wings! We got the wings combo which is your choice of number of wings and then fries and a drink. The fries were SO good, crispy and seasoned and a big portion! I am always curious about how many sauces you can try on your set of wings and they are not a place where it is simple for example, \"5 wings to one flavor wing sauce\". Here's a small breakdown:  -5 or 7 piece wings get one dipping sauce (ranch or blue cheese) and one sauce on the wings -10 piece wings you get one dipping sauce and choice of two flavors -15 or 20 piece wings you get two dipping sauces and choice of two flavors  -25 piece wings you get two dipping sauces and choice of three wing flavors  -30 piece wings you get three dipping sauces and choice of 3 wing flavors   And it actually goes up to sets of 40,50,75 and 100. If you want an extra ranch, you gotta pay for it, probably because it's that good thick ranch!   Then you can choose how you want your wings cooked we went for Extra Crispy, 15 wings combo with two ranches and hot honey and spicy garlic Parmesan. The food came out FAST and hot! We liked the hot honey a lot more than the spicy garlic parmesan. Both were very crispy as they promised! To sum it up, I would come back to try more flavor of wings and they actually have a whole second menu filled with pizza, tenders, sandwiches and salad.",

My food was done in less than 10 minutes! I was shocked! I just think it's a little expensive for take out but I will definitely be back when I want some good wings",

The wings, no matter which of the many flavors you choose, are cooked to a perfect crisp, but not over done.  No rubbery chicken skin on the flats.  To us, these are the best wings in the Charlotte area.  All the fried items are good and not at all greasy.  Service is fast and friendly.

I always order the 15 piece combo which comes with a side and a drink. There is a good mix of spicy, sweet, and inventive sauces for your wings and the wings are always the perfect combination of juicy with a firm and slightly crispy exterior. Most wing places that do take out usually leave you with soggy wings by the end of your commute but TLC stays crisp.  It's a little out of the way if you don't live in Pineville, but I'll gladly go out of my way for the quality.",

So when we order we ask that they don't over cook the wings cashier says no worries I'll take care of it. Our fault for trusting  that they will actually do what they said. WRONG! It was beyond over cooked it was hard as if it was over cooked the night before, left out all night uncovered and refried. Just THAT hard  When you call their cashiers not only don't speak English really well they just don't understand. The guy argued that it was not over cooked and told me I was wrong!!  who does that! So in the pouring rain we took it back and yet they argue with you. While the cashier was licking his fingers after he threw a chicken home out in the trash.

    "text": "If I could give TLC no stars, I would. I just got back to my hotel with my dinner order and it is inedible. I am a buffalo wing lover and I could not even put one of TLC's wings close to my mouth.  First, the boneless wings look like frozen chicken nuggets that are covered in freezer burn. When you get wings, you expect for them to be cover in sauce... my sauce was sitting in the box under the wings. It's like they didn't even try to put the sauce on the actual wings. How hard is it to toss wings in the sauce?   Second, they put the ranch sauce in the box with the wings so it was hot when I opened it. No one wants warm ranch dressing. The point is to have a refreshing chill to go with the hot wings.  The only redeeming thing about TLC was that they offer fried pickles. They were decent, but again, ranch was hot and not able to be used as a dip for the pickles.  Do not bother eating here... pure disappointment!",
