Lots of beer on tap, though we didn't have any.  Not too busy early at lunch but business was picking up as we left.  Service was good.  Attentive server, friendly and nice.  Manager swung by to check on us.  That was nice.  Some in the party had the pizza buffet.  All were happy with it.  We asked for a special pizza and they made it right away and it was on the buffet.  Salads were good.  I had a chopped salad and thought it was excellent.  Great value for a quick lunch.  I would go back given the chance.",

    "text": "I've been to the Pizza Peel twice so far and I've never made it past the patio. It's just too darn inviting and we always end up there. Maybe when it gets chilly we will head inside, or just sit really close to a heater...   The best thing about this place is that they have a GIGANTIC beer selection. I think we went on a Monday once and they were having a Beer Poker for a really cheap price. It was like Beer Roulette to me, you didn't get to pick the beer, it was just a surprise and you drank whatever they brought you. Good way to try new stuff though so we tried it, and it was fun. We also learned what will cause bitter beer face and what to stay away from next time. LOL  The food here is decent, but it's not my fave. I'm not a huge pizza gal either though so perhaps that's why. But I tried the garlic knots thinking they'd be amazing, and they just turned out to be a greasey pile that made my stomach upset after eating 2 of them. The next time I went I had a salad of some sort that was on their special board and it was pretty great, and spicy.   It's a great place to be a regular and it's close to home so I'd def say to give it a go.",

    "text": "We live close to this Pizza Peel so it's convenient to go but after the last few times, we aren't coming back.  The pizza is okay, but highly over priced.  For 2 personal pizzas (8inch) and 1 beer it was 30 dollars.  It's not the pizza that gained this 2 star review it's the service.  The female servers are horrible, slow and rude.  We used to get one of the men servers and he was always on top of it and was super friendly but the female servers are terrible. This last time we went in I tried ordering a beer that the waitress said \"oh I've not heard of that before, no one ever orders that\" then to return 10 minutes later to tell me they were out of it (thought no one ordered it?!) so I ordered another similar style beer and she said she didn't think they had that either but instead of just walking over and asking she decided to yell from our table to the bartender \"Hey we don't have ___insert beer here___ do we?!\" and the bartender said no.  The whole place stopped and looked over, very embarrassing.  So then she told us we couldn't order anything but pizza and beer, (which we wanted wings) she never explained why not.  After we paid and left I wrote to them on fb in a private message and luckily the owner was very nice and offered us a free meal and explained why they weren't serving anything but pizzas (they had the fry cook leave for the night) If we ever decide to use the free meal we will just go to the one in Plaza Midwood, but there are better pizza places in Charlotte.",

The environment is really homey, dark wood everywhere, casual and family friendly.    But what really got me, was the yummy pizzas with plenty of creative toppings and nice wheat-ish chewy, tender crust on the inside and crisp, crunchy outside.   An 8 inch pizza BBQ or Thai pizza at PP is $8.  Over at California Pizza Kitchen, their pizza is 10 inches and is about $11-$14.  The similar 10 inch specialties at Mellow Mushroom are about $11- $13. (Some are cheaper, like the plain cheese.) Honestly, for the price-- I don't miss the additional 2 inches of pizzas!  PP $16 larges are also about $3 or $4 less than the MM large 16 inchers.   Oh, and the BBQ ribs appetizer was tasty-- for $5 you get 3 big ribs that are dry rubbed, baked then fried and drenched in a savory/sweet BBQ sauce.    Can't wait to try the pizza lunch buffet for $7.50 with pizza and salad included!   PS:  Oh yeah, and the magician, Magic Barry who makes an appearance on certain nights, he is a blast in a glass.  Like a more wholesome, senior citizen version of David Blaine :-)",

Enjoyed listening and would go back to hear again.  BF had the chicken parm... said the roll it was on super tasty and the chicken was nice and crispy and tender, he would order again. I decided to try the tomato basil mozz pizza... when it first came out I thought it didnt have enough cheese, I was wrong. The mozz was cut on the thicker side so you got a nice bite of cheese and that good cheese string pull from it.. their sauce is outstanding and is a star on this pizza. The basil, instead of being the traditional leaves was chiffonade which allowed for you to get basil in each bite.  The owner/manager came by, he has been there each time we have gone and you can tell he loves the business and has a vested interest in ensure his guests have a good experience.",

Here is the rundown and yelp star ratings on the components:  Pizza Sauce: great flavor better than most, 4.85 yelp stars  Pizza Crust: Thin and thinner than many, great flavor 4.9 stars  Cheese: YAY!  A strict Mozzarella (no blend YAY!) perfect volume 5 stars  Red Onion: Great flavor and sliced perfectly THIN! !! !!! 4.75 stars  Garlic Knots: Totally Fresh! BIG 5 stars on size, 3.9 stars on flavor, tasted like canned powdered Parmesan Cheese, mixed with plenty of fresh Garlic!  It is doubtfully I would be dating someone who dose not LOVE Garlic (unless it was a first Date)!  Marinara Sauce: with a little Cheese very good 4.75 stars  The Servers here are great, all have very outgoing personalities with great sense of humor and I asked each of them who the Funniest server was they could only agree that the one wearing a Pig on her \"chefs\" hat was the Craziest!  My server almost qualified for Superboy on Pizza palace (no crown) though it would still take a little work.  I walked in last Wednesday evening and I had that \"yelp is in the air\" feeling when I saw the Bar LOADED with beautiful ladies of  yelp I did not think I would be recognized so I took a Table right beside them... Then as they were moving to the Outdoor area (Plasticed in for the winter) I saw PINK (not the Rock star) the POPROCK star Tonya P.

Here's what I objected to: The individual pizza is 8\" but because they leave a fat roll of dough all around the cheese and toppings only cover a 6\" area (that's small).   The crust is chewy and it doesn't get crunchy although the pies were well baked. It's also not very flavorful. The cheese layer is minimal, which works with thin crust pizza only this is thick crust so no it doesn't work. The veggie toppings are of OK quality but cut to tiny, tiny pieces and very sparse. I think I got one small mushroom cut into 4 pieces, same with grilled pepper, artichoke etc. Result was  totally underwhelming.  Meat wise I ordered chorizo stupidly expecting a few slices of Spanish chorizo instead it was some ground meat with Cumin instead of cured meat with paprika. MEH!  I'm not going to detail the other pizza but it was very much the same. Like the waitress said: \"Voila, y'all!\" I doubt I'll go back.",

    "text": "There's alot to like about Pizza Peel. The lunch special is a buffet of pizza, drink, and a salad. The toppings and crust are both flavorful, and their salads are surprisingly great too. I'm all for Dominoes or Papa Johns as much as the next guy, but Pizza Peel is where I'd go for a great pie.   They have dozens of beers on tap, and a nice variety of other dishes. I haven't tried anything but the pizza buffet, but based on that experience, I'd easily go back for dinner.   The only knock I have against them is their prices. Everything seems a little high, and $20 for a large pizza is a tough pill to swallow. But the quality is good, and the staff is friendly too.",

The pizza was literally just the cooked dough with some red sauce. I am baffled as to why they would think that because I didn't want Cheese that I would also not want any of the other toppings that came with the specialty pizza. Will not order from there again.",

Very quick service and great pizza! We ordered the bruschetta appetizer (it's called something other than \"bruschetta\" on the menu) and it was delicious! We ordered two small pizzas - the buffalo chicken and a BYO with pepperoni and green peppers. Both excellent! Our server was very attentive and sweet. Also, hey have a big beer selection!  Can't wait to come back!",

I must admit they were a little pricier than I thought $21 for 16 inch pizza, with upcharges for certain toppings.  I ordered a vegetarian pizza topped with jalapenos peppers which came at an extra charge and a peel pepperoni with pineapple, which came with lots of pepperoni and $1 extra charge according to their menu.  The lots of pepperoni was a bit of exaggeration.  I guess what turned me off is how they nickel and dime you for extra toppings. They even charged me for a side of balsamic dressing.  I guess given the initial cost I expected the little extras to be free which they weren't or the pizza to be extraordinary, which it wasn't either.  It wasn't bad just ordinary.",

Here are a few reasons why it's high on my list:  - Draught beer selection is large and diverse. Lots of craft offerings. Old standbys as well as soon to be favorites from far and wide. - Pizza. Slam dunk. Every time. - Salads are dreamy. Well-executed and lacking nothing. - The pasta dishes are really solid. Sometimes I come in wanting a heavy, carby meal and these don't disappoint. - The Mr. raves about the wings, buffalo & blue cheese sandwich and fish tacos. I can't speak to those, but he keeps ordering them...so they must be good. I've heard they're the best fish tacos in town. Go try them and let me know! - Specials. Every day, they're rocking special menu items that run the gamut of flavors. Go out on a limb and order one.   I especially love the patio, which can be heated for the chilly winter weather. It's also perfect for families...I see families everywhere! Beer for the parents, pizza for kids...what more could you ask for?  All in all, this is a great place to go for pizza and lots of other stuff, too.",

I'm not a beer drinker, but I'm very much for trying new things or learning about things...so when the beer class was offered, I was excited to go! A bunch of us ladies showed up and filled their heated and enclosed patio. Brian was a great teacher and was very knowledgeable about the beer making process (even passed around barley and hops). Did you know that hops not only makes beer bitter, but also works like a preservative? *Call me, A+ student*  We tried about a half-dozen types of beers...I should have taken notes, but just remember some were light and others were dark, some tasted like grapefruit and some like coffee, some smelled decent while others smelled not so decent. I guess beer is an acquired taste and one that I don't have yet...but I can appreciate the process and variety. By the way, they have a huge list of beers!  This same class is open to the public every Wednesday night in the month of February starting at 6:30pm. Next week, lagers or ports will be the focus.   The restaurant itself stayed busy and many people stopped by to pick up food to go. Next time I'm here I'll check out their pizza since I've read so many good reviews.",

The pizza was excellent and service was speedy.  We ordered a specialty pizza called \"One Veggie\" - Red Sauce, Mozzarella, Roasted Garlic, Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Artichokes, Pesto.  I would highly recommend it to anyone!  Besides the specialty pizza selections you can also create your own and they offer 8\" and 16\" sizes.    Also, good news to people with small children, this place is incredibly family friendly!  Along with the impressive beer selection, they also had an impressive selection of flavored milk!!  It seemed like more milk was being served than beer when we were there.    If you are not looking for a kid friendly environment, just show up later around 7:30 or 8pm.  I think we arrived at family happy hour (around 6:30), but all the children started to disappear around 7:30...bedtime! :)  So I would highly recommend for pizza and beer lovers with children or without children!  Just pay attention to what time you decide to show up!",

The sauce is relatively bland and they were quite stingy on the toppings. The crust was pretty good. I have been in Charlotte for a month now and it seems like bland food is par for the course across the restaurant spectrum. I am from New Orleans and this is what we affectionately refer to as Yankee pizza. Not bad but definitely no Mardi Gras for the taste buds. The beer selection and the fact that I live around the corner will bring me back. The pizza is better than the big chains but that is where the superiority ends.",

That is, it's inside can get kinda cramped and crowded if they are running at even half capacity. Still though, the people crowd in for the awesome pizza they have here and the great beer selection. They do pretty cool specials on different beers so if you come in during the week you can sometimes find some discounted pints to try out. Also, they have their own \"beer club\". This is a lot like Taco Mac has but kind of a mini version since Pizza Peel doesn't have 4000 beers to choose from. If you frequent a place long enough these beer clubs are pretty cool because it encourages you to try out different beers. Also, they have more than a couple local breweries included on tap which is awesome and shows they support the community. As for the food. The pizza is very good and so are the nachos and wings. The wings could actually be a little more flavorful but I'd recommend trying them out if you ever get the chance to stop in and are hungry for a app.",

The seating is European style. Meaning you could be at a table close to someone else. [I like this style, it makes some uncomfortable but get over it] The food is good. The only thing I've been slightly annoyed with the service, is that at lunch time they have a pizza buffet, which the server never mentioned to my group. The buffet is cheaper than a single pizza.   CONS:  The bar area really isn't defined. There can be issues if you are sitting near the bar and people try to participate in the bar at a second level deep. This is more of a staff deal [which should stop that]  Given that, I would go back here. The food is good, the combinations of the pizzas are unique.

The pizza is made in a brick oven and personal-sized pizza is around $8-9.  Crispy crust, fresh ingredients.  The other selling point is the ambience  The wait staff are very amicable folks who don't mind mingling with the customers.  I once curried the favor of a manger who let me take home a nifty pint glass for free.  Who else does that?  The place is real cozy; its small and gets crowded on weekends at night.  At such times, the service lapses somewhat. But if you can take a long lunch, hit up Pizza Peel.  Or if you're bored on a weeknight, you can play trivia in a place small enough to hurl banter at opponents on the opposite end of the restaurant.  Ya'll gonna love it, ya hear?",

We can in for lunch and a pizza and salad while incurring one problem....no service. After immediately being seated, no one came to take our order. I tried twice to flag down the only two wait staff and both responded with \"someone with be with you shortly\" After 16 minutes, we left. Wasn't that busy either....strange",

    "text": "Come for the pizza, stay for the beer.  Pizza Peel is that neighboorhood pizza place where somebody inevitably knows your name.  It's small, but it somehow manages to accomodate sports fans (at least 3 big TVs to watch the games), families with kids, the post-work crowd who loves trivia, and those who are just generally hungry for good food and drink.  When the place gets packed, it feels like the small building might split its seams, and you better not be claustrophobic, but outside of a weekend night, it feels homey and cozy.  The offerings are diverse and ecclectic, with both Thai pizza and fish tacos sharing the same menu, but everything you'll try is tasty, and the prices are reasonable.  Their beer list is unmatched in quantity and variety, with about 30-40 beers on tap, and many more in bottles.  Friendly staff, fast service, high-quality ingredients, unique flavors, and another round of alcohol - what more could you want?",

    "text": "Since I had Monday off for the holiday I decided to venture out to try the Pizza Peel for lunch. It's a bit of a drive for me, but it was worth it. They have a lunch buffet M-F from 11-2. Buffet is a bit of a stretch. The only have room for 3 maybe 4 pizzas at the most. I got there around 1 pm and there wasn't much of a selection, but they had some pizzas in the oven which came out pretty quickly and after that they did a good job of keeping the pizzas well stocked. The buffet also includes a salad and drink, which is great considering most places charge you upwards of $2 for a drink along with your meal. The salad was mixed greens with tomato and some Cheddar cheese. It was crisp and fresh. Since they don't have much room for pizza they usually do half & half pizzas. I didn't really try to figure out which was which, but it was all good. The only complaint I could make was that on some of the pizzas the center was a bit soggy, but that happens most places when they load the pizza up with toppings, so it wasn't a big deal. The crust was thin NY style with a nice chewy crust. If you want a good, cheap lunch, then stop by the Pizza Peel. Heck if you just want a good pizza stop there.  This was some of the best pizza I've had here in Charlotte. They also had many beers on tap and in the cooler, but by the time I was done stuffing my face with pizza I didn't have much room for beer. That just gives me an excuse to stop back some other time.",

    "text": "This is a really neat pizza spot! I came here with my brother and a friend to check it out. When you walk in, it's sort of a chilled bar family atmosphere. You'll see families eating and the ceiling gives you a sense of a nice country home feeling.  So. Here's what's up. They only have two sizes of pizzas here. A 8\" and a 16\", and priced at $8 and $20 respectively it's kind of weird. I would think double the size would be double the price, but it isn't the case. This is what I ate when I came:  1. For appetizers we ordered wings and nachos. Me personally, I felt the nachos didn't do justice. The amount of beef and stuff that came with it didn't balance. My brother would have gotten the house chips instead, as he was eyeing it when he was walking out at another table. The wings, we mixed the sauces of teriyaki and buffalo so it turned out pretty good. It had a kick and at the same time the sweet taste came in to accompany it. I enjoyed that.  2. Pizza. We decided for 3 we a 20\" would be just fine. I believe we got a specialty pizza with onions, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, pepperoni, and I believe bell pepper? I have a photo attached, but I don't know really what it was called. I enjoyed the pizza because it didn't have any weird taste like some pizza spots and it just went well. (It got me full!)  Overall, my experience was positive. The service was nice, and the waiter was very helpful in choosing what was tasty! I will definitely come back if I'm in the area and craving for pizza.",

Ive got a teenager who read your reply and alerted me to it and said this guy 'is being facetious, dont bother responding'.   Do you find it odd a teenager knows the definition of the word facetious and can see that is exactly the tone of your reply??  He pointed out how, where and why you were being facetious in every sentence of your response.   I think it is best to again say any review I make I make with no other agenda other then to be fair and honest. Nothing more. If you wish to take this seriously and not be facetious and allowing a teenager to see the facetious (his words, not mine, but its fun repeating seeing as how a teenager see's right thru the B.S.) nature of your reply, im sure he would be more then willing to speak with you directly and perhaps teach you a lesson.   In Vocabulary as well as life. Best wishes. Im sorry you did not like my review. Im far more sorry a teenager could see the insincere nature/tone of your response quite easily and again, if you wish to discuss this further, I'd be more then happy to arrange a meeting between you and him face to face and you can then add humble pie to your menu courtesy of a teenager who is far smart enough to see things more clearly then you realize.",

After being seated at our table it took around 5 minutes to hear from a server. Slow in delivering our drinks to us. 45 minutes after we ordered our pizzas we looked around and realized that 3 or 4 tables that came in well after us were already eating pizza. It took a few minutes to flag our server down and it was clear that he had not been checking on our order. Bottom line, our pizzas were not even being made. He apologized and offered us chips will we waited. Tables that came in after us had finished their meal and had left before we even received our pizzas.   Pizza Peel gave me no reason to be a return customer. Plenty of other places in the neighborhood to dine.",

Parking is limited and a bit narrow, but since I was there before, well, everyone, I found a spot and settled in to wait on my hot date.    The entire wait staff was fantastic.  Friendly, drinks were kept filled, the one change I made to the pizza order was met with a 'no problem'.  Prices are on par for pizza places that aren't chains  My order of an 8\" Positive Friction (sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, tomatoes, pesto, mozz cheese and I asked for goat cheese instead of feta) arrived quickly and smoking hot.  Toppings were of a proper amount and proportionately covering the pie.  As someone who prefers choices other than tomato-sauced pizzas, they had a very nice selection.  Also, their vegetarian menu is creative and fantastic.    I will definitely be returning to The Pizza Peel!",

The place is small with booths along the right side and tables in the middle and a 10-seater bar in the back.  There are 2 TVs above the bar and 2 on the opposite wall.   The lighting is interesting there's a metal rack above you with decorative light bulbs spaced ever few inches or so.  Neat idea.    There are plenty of local and regional beers on tap and a few other craft beers as well as Guinness, Stella and PBR.    The menu is simple with pizzas, sandwiches, salads and apps.  The pizzas sounded amazing but I noticed many of them came with a thai chili sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Interesting twist.  But I opted for the Chicken Philly sandwich.  It arrived and it appeared somewhat healthy.  The peppers were lightly cooked and crunchy.  They seemed like they were steamed along with the onions.  The chicken was tender but not a lot of flavor there and the cheese was smothered over the top.  The sandwich came with wonderful homemade potato chips and a pickle spear.  I could have eaten another batch of the chips.  Prices are decent.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  Definitely a place to come back to.  I just wish i had more options on my rating.  I don't think my visit was worth a 4 but it was higher than a 3.  So this a 3 1/2 rating.",

Luckily, it's just around the corner from our house & even though I try to eat healthy it doesn't take much effort for Joe to twist my arm and \"make\" me eat at \"the Peel.\" In addition to having absolutely phenomenal pizza, Pizza Peel has a very diverse beer selection, is a great place to watch sporting events, has yummy sandwiches and the best house salad in town.   Pizza Peel is definitely not a place to go to if you want to have a nice quiet dinner, but it's always a good time and fun for the whole family.. they even have a magician on Friday nights for the kids!   Definitely ask for the secret menu and don't be afraid to order the mystery beer... we haven't been let down yet by the selection!",

Looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but surprisingly a little larger in the interior.    My favorite part were the beer on tap special. They had a new pumpkin ale for like $3, great price and tasty. I has the nachos and my husband had a pizza. Pizza was standard, no chain pizza. No thick crust,  enough sauce and cheese ratio. I will say it was small, not enough for sharing in my opinion. Now my nachos, and I mean nachos with beef, sour cream, cheese, salsa, jalepenos, etc. Was amaxing. Everything came in the side corner so you could add more or as little as you liked. I loved it!   Lastly I can't not talk abt service.  Our waitress was speedy and attentive. She knew we needed to get out quickly so she multi-tasked greatly.",

The focus is on local brews, but you'll also find a great selection from around the Southeast and other regions of the country. And the servers are knowledgeable enough to help steer you to the perfect beer to quench your thirst.   The food is nothing to get excited about, but enough to keep you coming back. The Peel serves up a solid selection of decent pizzas, along with an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet that's a great value for the dollar. The pasta dishes are also tasty, particularly the lasagna, which is enough of meal for two people. The restaurant is kid-friendly, and service is always solid. Worth a visit, particularly if you love good craft beer.",

    "text": "I've heard good things about the pizza peel so I wanted to give it a shot. First off, they don't deliver so that's a little frustrating. But in any event, we ordered takeout and went and picked it up. We ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni pizza. That buffalo chicken pizza was a little too spicy for my liking but overall it was pretty good. The issue I have is with the pepperoni pizza we received, it was very over cooked. Now I understand things happen in a restaurant and things aren't perfect every time, but when it comes to take out this is extremely frustrating. Because you don't realize it until after you've returned home and are ready to eat. There should have been some quality control before the pizza was sent out of the kitchen. For me, this just ruins and experience. I personally won't return to pizza peel, there is too many other great pizza restaurants in Charlotte to choose from.    *** update***  So after my first experience that was subpar at the pizza peel. Management reached out to me and asked for a Second chance. I'm glad I took them up on their offer, the second time around the pizza was much much better and perfectly cooked. I now understand why the pizza peel has had such great reviews from other yelpers. They do offer a great product and their management and ownership is very responsive and thorough! I will continue to return to the pizza Ville and recommend them to others.  Thank you Chris!",

They have a wonderful selection of craft beers on tap -- many of which are local -- and their pizzas are awesome! I had their jambalaya pizza and it was perfect!  My only complaint is that the place gets EXTREMELY hot. The ceiling fans really do nothing but circulate the hot air that fills the dining area from their open kitchen. No one should be sweating at their tables, of whom I saw many patrons doing in addition to myself.  Until the weather cools or if they start cranking up their A/C, I would recommend not coming here during the warmer months.",

The crust was a little different than what I like at my normal pizza spot, but still good and crispy.  I think they said it was a wheat crust.  My pizza was perfectly sauced, cheesed & covered.  I enjoyed a really good beer from their really good selection.  I love that they have CCC Amber as that's one of my favorites.  It went great with pizza.  The bartender was a nice guy & kept checking back with me & even found the tennis channel for me to watch!  I went back the next time with my sweetied & eh, not such a great experience.  The bartendress was a bit mmm... flaky.  She couldn't seem to remember what we told her.    She also really chatted up this great sounding mushroom soup.  I got it to go since I just wanted to taste it before our pizza & then eat it the next day for lunch.  Well I got the soup, opened it up tasted it, & it was Tomato Basil with goat cheese & basil strips - you know it's a let down when you think you're going to taste one thing & then it's something else.  I almost sent it back, but it actually warmed up pretty good the next night for dinner,.  We got the same sausage & onion pizza, but large this time.  It wasn't that great.  Not enough sauce, not enough cheese, not enough toppings.  It's like they use the same amounts for both sizes, so it doesn't work as well on the larger one.  Sweetie wasn't happy.  I won't be back there with him.  I guess for me, it's good for the late lunch.  I'd go back.",

Tasted very good. My husband enjoyed his pizza. There sweet tea is wonderful. Enjoyed our date there. Would definitely come again.",

    "text": "I hate giving this reviews because I see all the great reviews on here but I have to do it. I came here a few nights ago with my husband. We walked in and waited at the hostess stand and no one came by. No one told us they would be right with us or nothing. We waited and waited. Finally a few other couples were walking in after us and asking if we've even been helped yet. Nope. We finally had someone come up to us and all she said was \"How many?\" We told her two and she sat us and walked away.   We didn't get greeted for a few mins. Our server was super sweet BUT had 7 other tables so she was doing the best she can but it was like pulling teeth. We ordered the chicken rolls and a salad and two small pizzas. The two couples that were behind us, got sat after us. For some reason, they got their pizzas before us and we haven't even gotten our appetizer or salad yet! There was no one to stop and ask about them because everyone was so weeded. Finally, our pizzas came. Ok, where is our appetizer and salad? We asked the food runner about it. She tries to take the pizza back. I stopped her and just asked her to leave it because there is no point. She finally gets us our appetizer and salad and says that they were just sitting there. Gee, ok.   The chicken rolls were ok but not great. They are definitely not worth $5 for two rolls that are the size of egg rolls. The pizza was also ok but very dry. I asked for extra sauce on my pizza and I didn't get it. When our server finally came around I asked her for a small cup of pizza sauce. She said she will get it. It took her FOREVER to get it. We waited almost 7 mins for it. Finally, my husband just went to the pizza bar area and asked someone for it.   Not worth it.",

Salad was surprisingly simple but very tasteful.   For the  value and quickness I would definitely recommend and come back when in the area.

The sandwiches took a very, very long time to be served and there were quite a few empty tables which was surprising since it was prime time Friday evening.  Overall the food was pretty good especially the salads.  I asked the waiter for some potato chips which is the usual side for the sandwich but he said that he couldn't give us any chips since we upgraded our sides to the salads.  I was a little stunned by his response. Very poor business practice by quibbling over a few cents of potato chips considering  the fierce competition for the public's dining dollars. Management needs to train its employees a little better.  Keep the customer happy especially after taking forever to serve a sandwich and maybe they will come back another time.",

Since I know the traffic in Cotswold area can be a little challenging at lunch time time I decided to arrive at Pizza Peel around 11:15 am. I had read they have a pizza buffet at lunchtime during the week, coming from NY, this was right up my alley since I have a great love for pizza. The pizza slices were delicious, a very tasty good size salad (with tomatoes!) & soft drink were included in the price. In addition I was also able to get a soft drink to-go cup. Would you believe all of this for only $9.99?! The customer service was excellent and the atmosphere was very inviting. This will now be my favorite lunch spot whenever I'm in the Cotswold area. Thank you Pizza Peel for a wonderful 1st impression!",

We go the supreme and what I likes the most was the taste of the pizza not being overwhelmed by the sauce.  Great mixture of all toppings.

It is fresh, if you get the veggie pizza with vegan cheese, it is LOADED with vegetable goodness. The crust is crispy, the cheese is melted to perfection (which with some vegan pizza situations at other places they either don't melt it enough or burn it...) and the personal size is a great size to fill you up.   The restaurant is super neighborhood friendly. It is easy to slip in and out for a nice casual meal and glass of wine or beer here. The staff members are all laid back, informative if you have questions, but overall they just let you enjoy your meal. The manager/owner occasionally drops by the tables as well. There are some TVs for sports, a bar area, booths and table seating. It is a place we enjoy dropping in and out of when we are feeling lazy, tired and hungry.   My review simply is pizza related because that is what we drop in for. However, my boyfriend also enjoys the meatballs here! We are Italians so often times are hard on pizza places, but we do keep coming back here so it definitely has goodness to it.  Great neighborhood causal pizza spot!",

I was here the night it opened and dozens of times since. They had the standard slight deterioration in service and product, but were still a good deal. I moved to another neighborhood and hadn't been back in a few months. Thought I'd take the girls tonight as we have an early start. We got there and were able to be seated right away, but were refused the seat we wanted as it was 'reserved'. Wait!? They don't take reservations.....but um? Even though they had 3-4 servers on the floor and 7 tables seated, it took 6+ minutes for someone to take out drink order. 6 minutes with a hungry 3&7y old. Sheesh! So once our order was in all went reasonably well... However the quality of their pizza has become sub-par. Maybe a notch above dominos at best, yet still over 20 bucks for a large pie with just pepperoni.  Won't be coming back....and until they get their act together is steer clear.",

    "text": "We visited Pizza Peel last night for the first time.  I have to admit that I was impressed.  I wasn't expecting a lot, but the atmosphere was enjoyable, as was the food.   For starters, I noticed that Monday nights was Beer Poker for $1.50.  I asked our server what that meant because -- ignorantly -- I had never heard of that before.  Was it a special kind of beer?  No.  The server grabbed a deck of cards and my partner and I each picked a card from the deck of 52.  The type of bottled beer you get (for only $1.50!) was based on the playing card you drew.  The higher the card, the better the beer.  I drew a King.  Nice.  I was brought a German Octoberfest import.  My partner drew a Nine and was brought a dark beer of some sort I had never heard of before.  Our server told us that they don't have typical domestic beers in the mix.  I'm guessing it's usually beers that aren't moving sales-wise or, in the case of my Octoberfest, is not in season anymore.  Hey, for $1.50, I'll drink anything.  And mine was actually pretty darn good!  Regularly (not on Monday nights), Beer Poker is $2.50.  Still a fantastic deal considering the prices of other bottles of beer!  They have a pretty unique selection of specialty pizza/toppings.  For dinner, we split a 16\" Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  I have to admit: that was one damn good pizza.  It wasn't spicy (at least not for me), but it was full of flavor. The downside was that it was $20, which seems a little pricey for a large pizza.    I'd definitely return to Pizza Peel, though...for dinner...and Beer Poker!",

Since there were only about 12 tables in the entire place, we clearly knew where we were sitting.    Service was good, and the beer list, as many have said, was extremely extensive.  I believe they have more than 20 beers on tap.  Pizza was also good, though not out of this world.  The best thing on the menu that night was probably this New Year's Day lucky soup - with chickpeas, collard greens, rice, and bacon - so good.

We even caught each other sneaking off to go add to their list without telling the others...I would say \"sneaking people\" but I was definitely one of them. I guess that is the competitor in me.  I have had everything from garlic knots to salad, pizza to soup and it has all been good. They have great specials every night...including $1.50 Beer Poker on Monday night. This is definitely one of the more consistently busy places in the Cotswold Area, but compared to the other restaurants in the area I understand why. I would definitely recommend The Pizza Peel for a low key night of beer and pizza.",

It was a little dificult to get to and the outside didnt knock me down with a come on IN feeling. But once i pulled on the \"pizza peel\" door handles it was like seeing a whole new world. Rustic wood beams and a huge bar with a TON of different types of beer on tap almost made me do a 2nd glance to see if i had stepped in to the twilight zone.   The server sat me and my wife down went over the lunch specials and asked if we had ever been here before. We explained we were new and he went on to tell us about the pizza dough (something about having molasses? maybe) and about all the diffrent types of beer on tap.   We ordered a half bbq chicken, half sausage pizza. Fricking awesome. I washed it down with some imported beer that leaves a fruit after taste i couldn't remember what its called but now that i joined their \"beer club\" they said they would keep track of all the beers ive tried.  Needless to say I loved it.  also this might sound gross but i dipped my pizza crust in my that imported beer. It was like my taste buds were in heaven just a little fyi tip.",

I ordered a salad that was supposed to come with dried cranberries, but there were none on it. I asked the server if it was supposed to have cranberries on it and she said it was, so she got some from the kitchen. I ordered the one veggie pizza, which I have gotten every time I've been there because it's usually really tasty. It was completely soggy except for the crust, and it disintegrated when I tried to pick it up to eat it. It also did not have a good flavor and was very bland. I ate 3/4 a piece and couldn't stomach the rest. I told the server it was too soggy and just not good at all. She had the cook make me another one and boxed it up for me. It looked better, but when I got home, (sorry to be graphic), I had the worst case of the runs and still have not recovered (over an hour later)! Definitely not going to eat the pizza they made for me to take home! Ugh! What a disappointment! I'm wondering what the sanitation grade is there.",

    "text": "I was recently invited to try The Pizza Peel and Tap Room on Colwick Road near Cotswold. The Pizza Peel turns out custom and specialty pizzas, pastas, sandwiches and salads and boasts an impressive beer menu. I like that pizzas are available in personal size portions and you can make even a personal size half and half - fun! There is also a Secret Menu. Ask for it.  I tried the \"No Apologies Pizza\" from the Secret Menu which has chipotle hot tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, chorizo sausage, spinach, red onion and whole roasted garlic - whew, that was one fully loaded and tasty pizza! The Roasted Veggie (available on the regular menu) was also very good. The dough on both pizzas tasted fresh and well cooked. I also really enjoyed the curry rolls: although not what you might expect at a pizza place, the fried curry spring rolls with chicken, carrots, onions and cabbage got my taste buds going and offered an excellent start to the meal. Other starters include garlic knots, bruschetta, nachos and even house made potato chips. The house salad I sampled was also top-notch and other salads are available as well. I love salads with fruit, nuts and cheese and this house salad fit that bill with cranberries, bleu cheese and walnuts - yum! Pastas like beer & four cheese lasagna and eggplant parm are on my list to try another time and the fish tacos have received accolades as well. The Pizza Peel definitely offers a diverse menu with something for everyone. Every week there are lunch specials and every day there are events like trivia, live music and pint night.",

The place is owned and ran by the same folks that own/run the local mama fu's.   Many of the wait staff have been at this location since it was a Mellow Mushroom, which means they know TONS of the locals.   This particular night was jam packed with folks, but my guest and I only had to wait 5 or 6 minutes to be seated.  The service was great and made us feel right at home (though them asking people to vote for them could have something to do with it)  The beer selection is awesome and I was very pleased they had Blue Moon on tap and they include huge orange wedges with their blue moon----YAY!  I ordered one of the smaller person pizzas with pesto and it was good.  Not the best pizza I have had in Charlotte (I reserve that title to Tony's) but was good nonetheless.   I will be returning to this place often if not only for the convenience and the beer selection.",

But no such luck.  3 of the 4 stars I've given this place are due to the fantastic, absolutely fantastic beer selection for such a small place.  From IPA to Barley Wine, Framboise to Stout, their beer list is impeccable.  Everyone who claims to like hops needs to drink Bell's Two Hearted Ale at least once.  The pizza is good.  And the service is friendly.  Certainly my favorite eat-in pizza joint in Charlotte.    I did penalize them 1 star for adding to the already saturated list of Charlotte pizza joints.  But again, this place is really good.",

Do not look at the beer list.... you will miss the experience.  Ask the bartenders... sample, play and enjoy.  Watch out for some of those Gravity Beers.

Even at $8.50 now, this is quite a deal, as the price includes a drink and a salad.  Really enjoyed my salad with their house honey basil vinaigrette.  Although they only have a few pizzas out at a time and were dealing with a full lunch crowd, they were pretty good about restocking quickly enough that I rarely had to wait.  They had some interesting offerings like both barbecue and buffalo chicken pizzas, a veggie pizza with roasted garlic that was one of my favorites, and the usuals like cheese and a meat lovers.  I did enjoy the pizza, although I'd say I've had better, but that's no knock.  For the price and the quality, the pizza peel makes for an extremely satisfying lunch experience.",

They have a wide selection of pizzas to try. I was impressed with the variety they present you with at the buffet. I think my favorite so far is the buffalo chicken pizza! If you get it, I suggest asking for a side of blue cheese to dip it in (YUM).

Husband and I both ordered one of the highlighted beers on the menu- 2 different IPAs, both were very good.  Make sure you verify the check- one of the beers was charged at the special price and the other at full but once it was brought to the attention of the waitress she took care of it with no issues!   We started with the bruschetta and found it to be very good. The asiago cheese mixture was seriously addictive and kept me going back for so many little pieces of toast that I was afraid I wouldn't be able to eat my pizza.   I ordered the create your own pizza with double cheese (mozz and cheddar) and the husband got the BBQ pizza. Both were good, but nothing that I find myself craving and feeling the need to rush back for.

The pizza is quite tasty and it's a quaint little spot for a casual lunch or dinner. As Todd W mentioned, we noticed that a) it's pretty dark in there (even during midday) and b) their beer list is almost unparalleled in Charlotte. Nice start!  Staff was pretty friendly, albeit we didn't need too much attention during a late lunch. While they do have a $7.50 pizza lunch buffet Mon-Fri, 11-2, I went with the small (8\") Red & White Pizza. This delicious 'za included ricotta, mozzarella, bruschetta and sun-dried tomatoes. It was well cooked but a bit heavy on the sun-dried tomatoes. I can only handle so much! Plenty of cheese though! I had a slice or two to bring home for leftovers and I exited happy & full.   And due to Leanne C's nerdy, but correct, engineering & math skillz, I now recall the reason why the 16\" pie costs more than twice than the 8\" pie. You see, folks, using the formula A=pi*rsquared. Yes, that's pi * the radius squared, an 8\" pie has an edible area of 50.24 sq. inches and the 16\" pie has an edible area of 200.96 sq inches. Therefore it *does* make sense that their 16\" pie costs more than double their 8\" pie. Although...you typically don't see this on menus due to extremely high economies of scale at pizza joints. Anywho. That is all.",

    "text": "This is an interesting little place. Kind of small and crowded, but not to the point of being obnoxious. The place seems like a nice little neighborhood joint, a refreshing change from all of the chain restaurants that are cold and completely devoid of any real character.   The tap list was fairly decent, with a definite slant toward local and regional offerings. The only disappointment was that it leaned to heavily on IPA's, DIPA's, and Stouts not nearly enough representation of other styles.   The service was pretty good, the waitress was helpful, and my beer glass never sat empty (always a good sign). The on staff beer guy was knowledgeable and friendly, and eager to talk beer.   The food was good; better than the chain pizza places, but not quite as good as Luigi's or Mellow Mushroom. A little pricey but not too bad.",

    "text": "I went on a Saturday around noon hoping to try The Mellow Mushroom.  When we discovered that there was no such pizza place at the address, we decided to try The Pizza Peel.  There was only one server at the time running 3-4 active tables.  We wanted the pizza buffet, on which were no pizzas at the time because the autistic man in his 20s took the only pie that was on the buffet.  :(  The chef, caught unprepared, asked us exactly what toppings we wanted.  Of course, I ordered Hawaiian.  It was delicious and well worth the wait and trouble.  For making us wait, the waitress deducted a fair amount of money from my bill.",
