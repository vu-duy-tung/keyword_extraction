That creates a little shelter that gives you some privacy during a nice romantic meal.  I'm a fan of the trout dish specifically but the fish tacos are also a great endeavor!  Service is close to 5 star and everyone seems very polished in their waiting skills.  Definitely a place I need to visit more often!",

    "text": "I had lunch here yesterday and it was awesome.  Our very nice waitress went over the menu with us and gave us some helpful recommendations.  We learned that the menus are printed twice daily depending on what fresh fish they've received that day.  The fresh fish and their bays of origin were printed at the top of the menu as well.  Well, that's cool.  We started off with a large plate of fried calamari - it was hot, crispy, salty and served with 3 different dipping sauces.  I ordered a cup of their crab soup and a side salad to start.  The soup was really good - a hot tomato based vegetable soup with chunks and shreds of fresh crab meat.  From the sighs of appreciation around the table, I think that the seafood chowder must have been very good as well.  The salad was dressed with a tangy vinaigrette and it was about as good as any mixed green salad could be.  Per the waitress' enthusiastic recommendation, I ordered the mahi mahi cakes.  They were basically prepared crab cake style and were flash fried so they were crispy and browned on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside.  They were served in a slightly spicy tomato-based sauce and topped with fresh salsa.  The meat was strongly seasoned with pepper and various spices so it wasn't fishy at all.  The two cakes also came with a large triangle of spicy vegetable-studded polenta.  We were stuffed after our meals, so we didn't get to try any of the desserts but they looked hearty and very all-American.  Maybe I'm accustomed to NYC prices, but I found McCormick & Schmick's friggin' cheap.  The whole meal, including drinks, appetizers, and entrees for 6 people only cost $150 after tax & tip!  It makes me almost want to move to the South.  Note: I think there's an M&S in NYC (near Rockefeller) too, but I think that it's more expensive, hence less awesome.",

    "text": "McCormick and Schmick's has a reputation as one of the best seafood restaurants in Charlotte (personally, I'd have to go with Upstream, but it's a pretty close call). The name is obviously great, too.   This is a pretty fancy place, so I'd suggest it for meaningful dates or, more likely, for business meetings/dinners/parties. The space in there is huge, so it can take care of pretty much any sort of function. Great atmosphere, great service--pretty much the experience you'd expect from a fancy steakhouse, if that makes sense.   All the fish is great, but a few items really stand out to me: the salmon caesar salad is amazing if you're looking for something on the lighter side (and for lunch), the macaroni and cheese (you can add lobster) is unreal, and the shrimp n' grits is pretty darn amazing too. I'll definitely go back, If you're trying to figure out a place to dine, go no further.",

As someone who doesn't want a side-of-beef for lunch, the sushi and seaweed salad options seemed like a great option.  The Ahi-sashimi/cucumber/seaweed salad was *very* good (and would have been plenty for a light appetite).  I got talked into adding a California roll appetizer to the meal, and was sorry.  The rolls were not fresh (the rice was dry and falling apart).  I'm probably not the typical lunch client at an establishment like this, but I think the portions offered could be better controlled.  Note to establishment: I will happily pay for a very well executed entree that doesn't take two people to bring to the table.",

    "text": "Didja ever have a restaurant open up right near where you work and you keep saying \"I need to go there!\" and yet you never do and then it's like two years later and you finally go and you're like \"Dang, I shoulda been coming here way more often!\"?  Well that's McCormick and Scmick for me.  Here's the good stuff:  My wife and I had the occasion to have a special night out to celebrate our birthdays (they are very closer together).  She decided that we would go to M & S as a treat.    The atmosphere is warm and inviting with deep wood finishes, comfy seats and very nice decor.  We were greeted immediately and taken to our table. So no trip to the bar area.  Our waitress was extremely helpful with her knowledge of the menu (which is printed twice a day as the choice of fresh fish and seafood changes!)  We decided to begin with the Rare Ahi Tuna for me and the Maryland Crabcake for the Mrs..  The rare Ahi was ridiculous!  I about lost my mind.  Just a hint of searing and a bright rare center, with a little bit of peppery char on the outside, I could not have been happier.  The crabcake was excelent: crispy outside, full of lump crab, it was one of the best I have ever tasted.  For din-din, I ordered the broiled plate (scallops, shrimp, baked oysters, and salmon with a bourbon/maple glaze) and Tara got the Wild Salmon with Shrimp, Crab and Brie stuffing.  Two words: SHUT UP!  They both had side items that were standard, but we both chose to change to the mashed taters with a lobster gravy and briased spinach.  Three words: SHUT UP MORE!  I have never in my life been quite so pleased with an entire meal.  I have also never eaten shrimp so well prepared (It was NUTS!).  The hardest part of the meal was to pace myself and not just gobble everything in sight.   For dessert, my wife went with the white cake with strawberry filling and I got more food (Buffalo fried gulf shrimp) and they were both yummy.    I have neither the stamina or time to explain how great this meal was.  Suffice to say that this will become a stop for us as a special occasion restaurant as well as a place to bring out of town guests.  For our budget, it was a little hefty, but worth every single penny spent.  EAT WELL!  V-Dub",

I think I tried their etouffee once but was not impressed. On a separate occasion they had king crab's legs which were pretty good. Whatever it is, this is your typical McCormick's fare.",

    "text": "Oct. 20, 2012 My wife and I have been to M&S many times in the past 7 years.  The attraction of fresh fish and seafood is a welcome feature for 2 seniors from New England now living in Charlotte.  Our most recent meal at M&S will be our last.     The two fish main dishes were only ok but the side dish of coleslaw was disgusting in taste.  The dressing tasted like a mixture of window putty and paste.  I dare the kitchen staff to sample it and swallow a forkful.   The \"chips\" or French fries that were served with the Fish and Chips were soggy and cold and lacked any seasoning what-so-ever.  The fish was tasty but the pieces were shaped like large round beer battered chunks rather than the usual fish pieces that I always order.  The service is probably the most disappointing.  On the table we only needed 2 place settings and the remaining two settings were never remove resulting in a cramped and cluttered table.  The first course dishes were never removed and this added to the already cluttered table.   The server removed my wife's wine glass  while still containing a fair pour of wine.  My water was never refilled and I had to replace it with my wife's water glass while the server watched with no attempt to rectify the situation for the rest of the meal.  In today's economy, an establishment with mid-to-high-end pricing, cannot continue to compete for the limited dining dollar when service and quality is no longer a reflection of the the claimed mission statement.  Thank but no thanks, my dining dollars will be spent elsewhere in the future.     Dr. Chuck",

    "text": "Overpriced, overrated, and tasteless food. We went to the S. Park location on a Sunday evening for my wife's b-day. The restaurant was empty, but no big deal...after all it was a Sunday night. The calamari had no flavor at all and tasted like fried grease balls. My wife had a caesar salad and I think 1 piece of lettuce actually had any dressing on it so they brought out a side of the thick ceasar dressing rather than taking it back and mixing a new one. The swordfish entree was decent but nothing special. My wife ordered the shrimp which was also decent, but our server forgot to bring out our side dish (you order the sides separate from the entrees) so unfortunately that was it for our entree. We decided to try the creme brulee thinking it couldn't be that difficult for them to get this right, but we should have known better. It was similar to the boxed custard that you can make at home and it was also very tasteless. I ordered the Irish coffee to supplement the make at home creme brulee, and it was probably the best item of the entire meal. Basically a mug of straight up Jameson whiskey with a little coffee added to it. Overall, this was a very extremely dissapointing meal and I felt especially bad for my wife as it was for her b-day.",

The place was dead, almost empty. With that said, you think the service would have been immaculate. Guess again. Empty hostess desk, finally greeted by the manager and seated. Waited some time before the less than pleasant server took his time coming over to our table. We immediately ordered drinks, simple juice and a cocktail for myself he asked if we wanted bread we said yes. We got water almost immediately but that was the extent of the service we received. Almost 15 minutes passed, no bread no drinks meanwhile he had made a point to stop by the table of the older white couple behind us several times with not even a glance in our direction. In the span of this time we watched other waitstaff dancing in the kitchen. This place is a joke. The Palm is right around the corner with just as good overpriced food and better service.... I will not be back, there are far too many other restaurants to tolerate poor service from lazy biased servers....",

    "text": "I took my grandmother to lunch as M+S on Saturday, figuring it would be good as she was a fan of seafood.  We were greeted to a pretty sparsely seated dining room, i guess Saturday just isn't the day in South park to eat lunch. Seating was a booth, large enough for three, and was missing a napkin from he setting off the bat. No big deal, the server who sat us just replaced it with one from neighboring table (and never replaced it). Our server came almost immediately and offered an awkward introduction asking blindly if we would like her to bring water. We ordered other drinks instead and she appeared with them a moment later. With a very dry tone, she recited what was clearly a scripted menu tour that outlined her favorites as well as the chefs feature. We took a minute to review and came to a conclusion. Now, I like that the menu is ever-changing, it gives you an opportunity to learn about seafood instead of just consume it. The lunch menu was one that I had seen a few times here with some pretty solid staples. Granny ordered the Grilled Shrimp Salad and I the Seafood Mac-n-Cheese.  Both arrived promptly by our server and drinks were refilled at the halfway point.  The Mac-n-cheese was good, a little over salted as I think the parmigiano cheese added a salt after the chef added his. The seafood was shrimp and scallops and had a crust of breadcrumb that added a nice texture. The scallops were bay scallops and added a sweetness that tried to offset the salt. I ate it all, it was good.  Granny's Salad had a generous portion of dressing, good, but I would recommend asking for it on the side and adding yourself. The shrimp were also generous, I counted 9, tail on shrimp, that were easily 16-20 count. Grilled to the perfect point so as not to seem rubbery.  Service was textbook good, server just had a dry sense about her that came off as a bit awkward. Food was good, with one small thing I would correct, and the meal came out FAST. I would go back, and take a guest.",

    "text": "McCormick & Schmick's is a fancy pants place.  Actually, they are not that bad.  I went last week, on a Friday, and it was kind of empty.  This is odd for Charlotte as places like these are usually always crowded in the area.  I guess the downturn in the economy has finally hit home.  Atmosphere - Lots of stain glass, the color green and wood.  Usually a bustling place but this Friday night at 7 PM, it was fairly dead.  Service - Like in most places of this caliber, our server was professional and knew how to properly serve.  This was made evident when he addressed and corrected an issue the way it should be, fast.  Food - Started w/ the House salad (mixed greens, candied pecans, blue cheese and citrus vinaigrette).  It was good and simple w/ fresh greens.  The main dish was a little disappointing.  I hand the Flounder encrusted w/ parmesan cheese.  It had more cheese than flounder and that is why I was disappointed.  At $20, you expect the fish to be better than paper thin.  I guess I will attribute it to cutbacks in the economy.  For dessert I had the Upside Down Apple Pie.  A dish I first had in Berkley, CA at one of M&S's sister restaurants, Spenger's Fresh Fish Grotto (see: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/bi\">yelp.com/bi</a>...).  Unfortunately, the first time it came out this night I thought the cinnamon sugar topping was a little on the burnt side.  My g/f thought it was edible.  I scrapped it off and continued on.  When server came out to check on us and get the check, I slightly winced and mention my displeasure w/ the dessert.  He looked at it and said \"I will be right back\".  He came out w/ another one that was far better and tastier than the first.  He apologized for what had happened and asked if there was anything else he could do.  This impressed as I did not complain much and did not ask for it to be replaced.  This is why you pay more at these places, service.  Overall - Our waiter turned a negative into a positive.  This definitely will have me coming back for more at M&S.",

I wish I'd listened to my husband's suggestion. We ate here on a Monday night, so it was not busy at all. The food was good, but the service left little to be desired. We had raw oysters, bacon wrapped shrimp, lobster bisque, crab legs, lobster tails, salmon, a bottle of wine, and dessert. Our waiter, Carson, should have been thrilled to wait on us, considering the amount of our bill, but he was quite the opposite. Every time he returned to our table, he set down items and just walked away! He even brought out my birthday cake with the candle in it, set it down, and walked away without a word! He was obviously wanting to chat with his coworkers instead of doing his job. The employees were all hanging around the hostess stand. At one point, the hostess even went to the restroom, changed into casual clothes, then came back out to the hostess stand. Management really needs to offer some more training for its employees.",

Her name was Tenille and she handled our big party like a pro! She offered great suggestions for drinks and meals.   We had no problem with parking and our table was ready when we arrived!  For starters I had a Lemon Drop martini, super delicious! Just make sure you can handle it because it's full of liquor! YUM! Also the lobster bisque was great. It's so cool how they serve it. They bring out the base of the soup and then once it's at the table they pour the bisque over it. Super creamy and flavorful! I could go for another bowl right now!  For my entree, I had the stuffed shrimp. It's Lump Crab Stuffed Shrimp with a side of veggies and  Red Pepper White Cheddar Mash. The crab stuffing is delicious! Full of huge pieces of crab meat and the shrimp is cooked to perfections!  The veggies are fresh but what acts as a perfect pair are those Red Pepper White Cheddar Mash potatoes. They are light and full of cheese with a slight kick after each bite. They literally have my mouth watering right now!   Everything that everyone had looked delicious and I look forward to going back again!",

    "text": "I wish I would have read the reviews before agreeing to go here but I didn't.  Our friends wanted to go here and stated it is one of their \"favorite\" places in Charlotte so my expectations were set from the beginning!  However, I have to say my experience ended up teetering between par and sub-par.    I don't really have much to say about the whole evening...it was just not that great.  It wasn't horrible but it wasn't fabulous.  It just seems like one of those chains that tries really hard to be super classy and elite but they never quite cut it.  They pose as some authentic 5 star restaurant when really underneath the white table cloths, dim lighting and suited up servers you are still left with a chain that just overcharges.  The highlight of the evening was the shrimp wrapped in bacon appetizer.  It was phenomenal and worth every one of the 12 dollars.  I ordered the special for the evening which was swordfish with lump crab served over veggies and spinach.  It was just ok.  It was a little fishy, which turned me off right away and it was like half a piece of fish.  Needless to say I left super hungry.  They should probably at least serve it with potatoes or something of substance because I could have eaten three of those meals with no problem.   Others ordered salmon and the scallops.  The stuffed salmon was a hit at our table so I would recommend that to anyone that is trying out M&S's.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy everything but again the portions were not satisfying...  I know seafood is lighter fare in general but it just seemed like they gave the smallest piece of fish possible and served it with the skimpiest veggies they could find.    For the price point you at least want to leave satisfied.  You can spend that dollar amount at any other 5 star restaurant in Charlotte and get a big fat steak and leave so full someone has to wheel you to your car.  Bottom line, this place is not for me.  I think they are good but not great and for the price we paid I want AMAZING.",

For our main course, my friend and I each had a ribeye steak with lobster mashed potatoes. The steaks were tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were great as well.  We ordered cocktails that weren't as much of a hit as the food. I ordered a margarita. When the server brought my drink, I realized she had not asked and I did not specify whether I wanted salt or sugar on the rim. The drink had salt on the rim and a small amount had fallen into the drink, so the drink was a tad bit salty. I sent it back and asked for no salt or sugar on the rim. The drink was ok. We received great service and I would definitely return.",

We shared shrimp kisses which was shrimp wrapped in pepper jack cheese and bacon, what's not to love! I had Seared Sea Scallops with Tomato Pesto, Crab Potato Hash, Sauteed Spinach and it was absolutely amazing.  My friend Nicole B had Blackened Mahi Mahi with Crabmeat Sautee, Andouille Mashed Potatoes, and they substituted asparagus because she does not like spinach.  She loved it! The 3rd party had friend shrimp and French fries. My friend told the waitress it was my birthday and she said she had a gift for me. It was copy of the menu that had my name and birthday on it, nice but not as good as free dessert would have been! And for dessert, we shared the Upside Down Candied Walnut Apple Pie Baked Twice with a Candied Walnut Crust, Warm Caramel Sauce and Served with Cinnamon Ice Cream.  The desserts are made in-house and when I say that was the best dessert I have ever eaten I am not exaggerating! We visited 35 restaurants in 12 days, and this one was in our top 3!",

Dan, now the ex :(, and I went for a late lunch/early dinner so we didn't need a reservation. However if you are going for a deal like that during any rush hour, make a reservation.   We received great service. The waitress was on the floor by herself for the first time, and I would have never known it unless she said something, not that it would bother me, I have special patience for waitstaff because its a hard job.   With the staff being great and food pretty good I would go here again, but like I said it is a little pricey. Enjoy!",

The Shrimp entree was excellent, and I would recommend it. The Flounder entree was greasy, over seasoned,and not good at all. The service was fine. I had a Margarita, and my wife had a couple of glasses of Riesling. The drinks, and the fresh bread were probably the best things we had.

    "text": "I was in the mood to go out and enjoy a nice meal with my wife. I chose a place that we have not been to before but have passed by quite often.  This is Mcormick & Schmicks located at the back entrance to South Park Mall.  My wife is not a big seafood lover as myself, but who who could pass up a nice center cut filet as shown in the photos and described on their website.  For starters, we should have passed.  I started by reading the yelp reviews, as I value other fellow Yelper's opinions.  It was lacking in the latest reviews for this location, so I had to step up and bring everyone the latest review after our dining experience for better or for worse.  I started by setting up the reservations online through yelp, using the open table reservation provided.  Our reservations were for 7:30 for a party of two for a Saturday evening.  We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time and was seated promptly by the staff.  We were seated on the right side of the restaurant in a booth which had a view of the patio. When it began to rain that evening on some of the patrons on the patio, we had some entertainment watching them scramble to get underneath the umbrellas. Cruel I know, but I had a less than desirable experience.  My wife had the Filet House Center Cut Filet Mignon (6oz) 29.95 (cooked medium) with mashed potatoes and a sweet tea. I had the Wild Caught Stuffed Salmon (a daily special not listed on the main menu) a glass of water and a glass of wine.  The bread was cold, the butter was very difficult to spread on the bread as it was hard and unable to be applied properly with a knife.  The server initially forgot my glass of wine, and it was at this point my expectations were being crushed!  The food finally made it out and at first appeared to be correct.  The steak however was more like well done with the smallest sliver of pink.  The edge was crusty and had a very tough texture and had the residue of a dirty grill .  My thoughts are that it was overcooked, but for only a 6oz portion, it was just a few bites. The center was edible, but she left 3 bites for server and notified the staff of the steak.  The mashed potatoes were warm, and was the highlight of her meal.  My Stuffed Salmon was very delicate, warm, and tasty. I was content with my meal, but not a great value for the special.  Upon the completion of the meal, the plates were removed, and we chose to forgo any surprises for desert and opted for the check.  It was at this time that we were presented the check and noticed that we were not charged for the sweet tea.  The server informed us that based on the amount of steak which was left on the plate, it was equal to the value of the sweet tea. ( REALLY! -  Are you F*&^* kidding me!)  So 3 bites of a 6 oz steak = a glass of tea.   Elizabeth C. says that $3.85 is a lot for a tea....... hehe.  My steak must have been priced wrong then.  Please I am not impressed with the this location and the name should be changed to McCormick & Schmucks!  Truthfully and Sincerely, NCFoodGuy",

However my friend and I dined at this location for happy hour  Our waitress was horrible after she took our order the only time she came back to our table was to ask if our check was together or separate. The manager came to check on us and one other waitress ( not ours). However the booth in front of us had her undivided attention. My friend and I enjoyed our  food and it came out quickly. The drinks on the happy hour menu were not so great (watered down )and were not very tasty. I would come here again because the rest of the were on point and the food was good.",

After waiting we did expect our food to be hot not warm.  I sent back the mashed potatoes.  The shrimp stuffed with lobster was good but also warm.  I just ate it.  What happened to the white table cloths which always set this restaurant apart.  Service was fair.  This once elegant restaurant has become rather ordinary.  I long for the days when they cleaned the crumbs off your table.  My family and I enjoy sprucing up for dinner, but when you see people in jeans and baseball caps it makes me understand why some restaurants don't put in the extra effort that at one time set them apart.",

My husband and I were excited to eat here as our wedding anniversary just passed and we are across the street but walked out after our meal to discover the very place we had our wedding reception (Baltimore,MD location) was right there  Staff greeted us and sat my husband and I in the back behind the bar in a pretty empty restaurant minus happy hour crew.  (Makes me wonder why sit my husband and I directly behind such a loud bar in a pretty empty restaurant)  Our waiter was awesome! We ordered the chef special and crab cakes. Crab cakes are what we really came back for because they were great at our wedding reception. However this location....not so! It was far from the fresh lump meat crab cakes we fell in love with more of an $8.99 traditional dining dish but still $14  Orders three course meal  Starter soup or salad. My husband enjoyed his soup and I my salad but my salad was a bit mushy? Not do to dressing but maybe my greens were refrigerated or something definitely not crisp but overall good walnut salad  Our entree was great! Beef medallions and shrimp. Everything cooked perfectly! We were on a high. UNTIL dessert came. Claimed to have been molten cake. Small! Couldn't find it due to the mound of melted ice cream and no the molten cake was not piping hot.   Being active duty stationed in Columbia SC this was the highlight of our trip for my husband and I as the rest will be filled with kid friendly activities   But great staff and service!! It was raining and we walked from double tree next door and was offered an umbrella to return later",

We shared the crab dip with pita bread wedges and it was excellent. The dip was very warm and moist. I had coconut shrimp in marmalade sauce which was to die for. Very tasty and well-presented, with vegetables and rice on the side.  My daughter had the macaroni and cheese, prepared with Rigatoni and creamy cheese with tomato bits. She didn't care for the tomato bits and had to pick them out! Warning: they were not listed on the menu. The servings were a little small but overall great experience and attentive waitress.

I love to color scheme of dark mustard greens, browns and tans. The table setting was elegant and I really appreciated the decor! It felt very warm and inviting. I only had a chance to experience one server but she was awesome! Super nice and upbeat, she even asked if the kitchen could fix my brother a steak even though it wasn't on the lunch menu and bought him a free desert.   As for the meal I had fish tacos. The tacos came with black beans, I didn't eat them though because they had bacon in them and I don't eat bacon. The tacos were good but I felt it was missing same kind of sauce...maybe an Aioli sauce. And maybe something spicy in there too. BUT I really loved the fresh bites of corn you got and the slight sweetness of the apple in the slaw.   Overall I give this place four stars just because the food didn't wow me but I definitely would love to return and try something else on the menu to see if there is something I like better. I would recommend this place! Would be a nice date for two! Might have to bring my boyfriend here so we can get oyster wasted.",

    "text": "I was in the Southpark area this past Sunday and thought I would check out McCormick & Schmick's for brunch. After arriving, and only seeing two tables seated and two individuals at the bar this should have been our sign to walk out.  Being a nice day out we were seated outside on the patio. Very nice area with comfy seats too.  We placed our drink order while we looked over the menu.  I started with a bloody mary, but had to send it back, it was awful..basically an entire glass of horseradish.  So, needless to say after 20 minutes and our waitress no where to be found I went straight to the bar and traded it out for a mimosa.  Needless to say when Nivia, our waitress, came to take our order she did not mention anything about the drink change..Maybe it is me, but I would have expected something. After reviewing the menu I decided to stick with their brunch items and chose to make my own omelet.  I chose ham, onions and swiss cheese, 3 items included, $.50 for any additional items.  So, I chose to add peppers.  The omelett came with potatoes and fruit, and I added an english muffin, another $.99.  After 30 minutes our food arrived and the omelett was okay.  However, they forgot to add the peppers.  Alright, not that big of a deal.  However, the english muffin was straight out of a bag, not even toasted..That is an issue. I waited and waited for our waitress to return to request that they \"toast\" the muffin.  Needless to say it was returned when I was almost finished with the meal. Overall, the service was horrible.  Nivia needs to find a job she likes and pay attention to checking on her tables more than once.  Note:  There was another table outside that seem to experience the same thing. A mimosa in a champagne glass should not cost $8.50, that is ridiculous! I will stick with McCormick & Schmick's uptown location for Happy Hour and dinner, but pass on brunch in the future.",

    "text": "If I could give it a zero, I would. It's Christmas and perhaps I should be more generous or forgiving but the service was horrible. Met a friend at the bar for drinks before meeting my family for dinner. Sat at the bar dropped $75 in less than an hour and had to ask twice for a glass of water. This is one of the more expensive restaurants in the Charlotte area, and with that I would expect the service to be better than usual. There were six in my party, and I ordered the filet medium rare. The server mixed up the orders when my uncle ordered the center cut filet; she put his order in as the center cut ribeye. So when she brought the meals she realized he ordered a center cut filet as well and instead of placing his order to be made, she served him my filet, and then placed my order again.  I did not mind waiting or giving my filet to my uncle but when my filet came because they had rushed it, it was raw. Now all of this probably could have been overlooked but on top of all of that the waitress came to the table served one person water; my glass was empty and she left the table. They removed my meal from the bill, which is about the nicest thing I can say. I know that a lot of people frequent this restaurant and perhaps my review won't make a difference in the grand scheme, but there are a lot of restaurants in the Southpark area and I would suggest you spend your time and money there.",

It wasn't, so we had hopes that service would be okay.  As it turned out, service was terrible.  Apps didn't arrive for nearly an hour, entrees shortly thereafter.  We had the swordfish (which was very good), chicken (which was okay) and a kobe burger that was so awful I was offended that it even made it out of the kitchen.  It was like a $15 hockey puck, except you can chew a hockey puck.  By that time, we were an hour and a half in and I had no further will.  Morton's couldn't make it next door (folded up and got replaced with a Mexican restaurant that is struggling as well) and as Anthony Bourdain says, this place has the smell of death in it.

    "text": "Wtf M&S, you make me feel like a schmuck for spending a Grant in your establishment. Chose this place for CRW because we thought it'd be a fancy schmancy safe bet that would accommodate the gluten free (not me).   What made this experience less than satisfactory for me was the service (or just our waiter), which is one of the elements a restaurant of this type should have down solid. Took forever to wave down our server when we wanted to put in a drink order and another millennium to place our food orders. However, he was very prompt in bringing out the check right when he put down our desserts. Came back a few times while we were still trying to enjoy our desserts for the check, only to be told that we hadn't even looked at it yet. Just let me eat my chunk of chocolate in peace dammit. And, you're a waiter at an establishment with a decent wine list, have a couple on mind to recommend, don't just stand there and stare at us. Also, when she pointed to the zin, she didn't point to the most expensive zin, which is what you charged us for, ass. Anddd, when someone asks for a gluten free substitution, it isn't that hard to ask the chef if that is possible. Patrons should not have to keep reminding their servers for food that won't kill them.   Okayyy, on to the food. We all had the salad as the first course, which was tasty albeit a tad over dressed, the green beans were a nice touch. I had the chilean seabass, which has dethrowned salmon as my favorite fish, and it was served with a side of mushroom jasmine rice (that, strangely, tasted exactly like taiwanese gluttonous rice, yeah that's what it's called) all sitting in a bath of pepper broth, which wasn't very peppery. (side note, why mention the daikon sprouts (not diakon as it's spelled on the menu, spell check guys) when it's just a garnish that adds nothing to the flavor?!) This dish, despite my ramblings, was actually good. The fish was cooked just right, the flavors were there and I much enjoyed the rice. I was also able to try the grilled ahi tuna, which was solid, but the baby bok choy it was served with looked like it could've been cooked by me, meaning it was sad and wilty. My other buddies got the petite filet and asked for medium. Now, I'm not an expert in cooking meat, heck, I don't even eat it, but one of the filets was bright red and oozing blood, that is not medium.   The dessert, only one choice for the CRW menu (let's step it up here people), was supposed to be a chocolate silk cake. It was more of a solid-block-of-cold-chocolate cake with a crushed oreo crust doused in raspberry sauce. It was tasty for the first few bites, but none of us could finish it all.   I've been to other M&S's and have always had good experiences, don't know what happened here. Word of advice, no McCormick and Schmick's for restaurant week ever again, there are tons of better (and local) places to try out and drop big bucks.",

It gets worse. The same Hostess stands on the chair in a booth to begin cleaning the top of a picture frame that was taller than her.

For fish and chips, they were pretty standard and I would not recommend them. Everything else was perfectly seasoned and cooked. It was a lovely evening treating my mommy :)",

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend decided to try this place for restaurant week this past Friday. While the restaurant was very beautiful, it was EMPTY. There were probably about 3 tables seated when we were there. We came around 4:30 though, so I figured maybe after 5 people would start coming in. No. This place is way too pricy and you barely get anything with your portions. Firstly, there weren't many great options for appetizers. We both got the New York carpaccio that was okay but nothing you could've made at home.  We both ordered the \"stuffed\" shrimp and steak with veggies. This was a joke. You got 3 pieces of shrimp and 5 pieces of already cut steak. And the rest of it was thrown vegetables on your plate of zucchini and squash. The \"stuffed\" shrimp wasn't stuffed. The crab immediately fell off when biting into the shrimp and some of it was already off when the plate was served to us. We got dessert and I had a chocolate pie, which tasted like a frozen candy bar that you could barely put your fork through because it was so hard. My boyfriend got some kind of upside down walnut pie which was actually good with ice cream. That was about the only good thing out of this whole experience. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Our grand total was $75 dollars for a mediocre meal that you could get anywhere or make it home. Nothing impressive, don't let the looks of the restaurant fool you. Service and staff were great, though. The only reason I even give the restaurant 1 star is because of the nice staff.",

We were greeted right away and asked which we would prefer, a booth or a table. I love when restaurants give you a choice if either are available. Our server was very sweet, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Mom and I both had salads. The lobster Cob was so yummy! I almost ate it all and it was a good size! The only downside to the meal was that they charged me 3.25 for an unsweetened tea. What??! I should have ordered their house chardonnay for a few bucks more.. Oh well. Everything else was wonderful and I'll certainly return for lunch again soon.",

    "text": "Alright, so my friend and I decided to hit up McC & S during Charlotte's Restaurant Week - Queen's Feast.  For those who aren't familiar; during Queen's Feast Week, participating restaurants in Charlotte choose to allow patrons to select a predetermined appetizer, entree, and dessert for $30.  As you may suspect, this is a bigger deal for some restaurants over others.  McCormick & Schmick's is one of those restaurants.  My friend made an 8pm, Friday reservation at the Southpark location. Sometimes I like to remember that I have fun clothes outside of my work attire, so I elected to rock a little-black-dress and heels.  I would say I fit in with the majority of the patrons.    The man who greeted us at the door in a full suit was very warm and friendly, and immediately showed us to our table.  The table was well-appointed.  As we started to peruse the menu, our server greeted our table with a professional smile.  I ordered a glass of Riesling, my friend stuck with water.  I LOVED that I ordered the larger oz. size of wine, and it arrived in a personal decanter for my pouring entertainment.  Pretty neat.    Here's where it got a little awkward:  Our server asked if we would like to start with an appetizer -- my friend told her we would be ordering from the Queen's Feast menu.  All the professionalism in the world couldn't have saved our server-girl from her crestfallen face.  Bless her heart.  (People, please.  If you elect to use your Groupon, LivingSocial deal, Queen's Feast hoo-rah, whatever; please remember to TIP your waitstaff according to the original price of your meal.  Waiting tables sucks enough as it is - at these high-end places, it is downright ridiculous.  People are trying to make a living.  Tip accordingly.)  Both of us chose to have the Clam Chowder as our appetizer - it was creamy, flavorful (not too fishy), delicious.  The chowder plus the fresh bread alone could've been my meal.  Entrees - I chose the steak, my friend had the salmon.  I didn't think my steak was too stellar (a little dry), but the potato-cake side item was delicious.  My friend loved her salmon.    For dessert, the sole option was the Decadent Chocolate Silk Cake, with raspberry drizzle.  It was a slab of pure chocolate, with a bit of raspberry.  I couldn't finish it all.  My friend and I were able to devour about half of our cakes, the end.   It was just too rich, and thick.  Very dense chocolate.  A chocoholic's dream, I'm sure.  As we all know, where tips grow or die is during the \"payment\" portion of your meal.  Our server was very prompt, and we were not rushed in the least to leave our table.  All in all, it was a pretty decent meal.  I'd like to save my pennies for the future and try this place again... order off the \"big kid\" menu :)   Sidenote - If you have small children, I would NOT bring them unless they are exceptionally well behaved.  I did not note a children's menu.",

Most of the group had steak which they said was very good. I had apple cobbler type dessert. Excellent. The apples were not overcooked. They were still firm and very tasty with the spice of cinamon and caramel. A great experience.  Our organizer had chosen wines. Oddly the servers were not very knowledgeable about them. Service including speed of plating our three courses was very good.",

    "text": "This is the second bad experience we have had at this location. We suspect it might be an understaffing issue. The service is slow and erratic. It seemed our waitress had the entire back room to herself. Anyway, I had asked if I could switch out a side. She said yes.  So I ordered fingerling potatoes and spinach to go with my swordfish. The potatoes had obviously been microwaved and were not all fingerling. Some were, but some were dry and mealy red potatoes the kitchen probably wanted to get rid of. I complained about the potatoes and the waitress replied \"so we know we don't like fingerlings.\" We? How rude! I do not like being talked to as if I were five years old. How about remedying the complaint? At this point she was clearly in the weeds. I got the spinach, but noticed on my check there was a $5 upcharge it. That is ridiculous ($5 for plain spinach?) and my main point is a customer should be informed of an upcharge when ordering. My glass of wine arrived when I was nearly done eating. When we finally got our check, out waitress went into a speech about the crowded parking lot. It was July 3 and there was some July 4 event nearby but we didn't see how that related to us. Maybe she was referring to the crowds coming in and how she couldn't keep up. As mentioned before, they were understaffed. It took at least an extra half hour to even get our check. That is a long time to wait. We just sat there and sat there with our empty plates. I still left a good tip for a total of $149, but I felt that was a high price for a bad dinner experience. It's a really nice looking place, and the tuna tartare was excellent, but I don't think I want to go back.",

My entree was the Lobster Crab Cakes, my mom had the Lobster stuffed Shrimp with the lobster mashed potatoes. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal today.

This location is different. Upon entering your greeted and seated. They have expectations about the happy hour that other locations don't have. For example,You must purchase a beverage to participate. Hmmm where is that on the site? Why not be consistent with the other locations. I planned on purchasing a drink but the didn't want you to sit at the bar if you weren't. The happy hour food appearance, taste, and texture is not like the rest of the food at this place. It's like they give you scraps.  The food from the general menu doesn't look or taste of quality. Something is off in the kitchen.  The vibe and energy is off. I should of known when I entered the last two times and it was empty during prime times. One being a Saturday afternoon when the mall was packed. The restrooms were clean and the restaurant looked clean with a good layout. However skip happy hour here or food and maybe just drinks.",

It was the Xmas eve so i guess people didn't want to cook. It's a nice location. Clean and the decor is looks like a high end pub. They brought her a free small molten cake for her bday.

Ate here with my daughter the week before last after some Christmas shopping. I was impressed with the friendly staff, and that was about it. The steak was over seasoned - far too salty. I had a shrimp and linguine dish that was not as well prepared as what I would cook at home, and I'm not much of a chef. Just very bland. My cutlery was dirty when I unwrapped it, and nothing puts me off a restaurant more than improperly cleaned forks and knives! My $15 glass of wine arrived warm - not room temperature, but warm, as if stored near something hot. The final straw for me was that, after spending $120 on the meal for two, I ordered a couple of pieces of cheesecake to take home to my wife, and received a surprise . 85 \"takeout fee\" on my receipt. I get it, it seems petty to complain about a hidden fee of less than a dollar. But after eating a $100+ meal, it seemed petty and cheap of the restaurant to charge it. For that reason alone, I wouldn't go back. There were, however, so many other reasons not to return.",

    "text": "So I ate here with my husband for Christmas. We originally had planned to cook at home, but a family emergency left us with no time to grocery shop and prepare, so dinner reservations were the next best option. We waited at the bar to be seated for our reservation, they were running 15 minutes or so behind, no big deal. I had a good glass of wine while we waited. We were seated and ordered, and our waiter was great! Then sometime between receiving an appetizer and dinner, a waitress lost the balance on the tray she was carrying and dropped the tray (full of dirty dishes) on my head and shoulder. She was mortified and I felt bad for her. It hurt for sure, but I wasn't bleeding and it was Christmas, so I didn't make a scene. The food was good and we got dessert, which was also good. The check came and there was no sort of compensation for the incident previously mentioned. I was sort of surprised, but again, no damage done (except I did find some food in my hair later). The next day, my husband finds an extra credit card charge (maybe for the dishes broken on my head?) and called the restaurant, who assured that they would call him back at a certain time. No call has been received and now we're disputing the charge on the card. Fortunately this isn't the only good steak house in Charlotte, because I doubt we'll be going back.",

I was originally going to order the stuffed shrimp but the pictures I saw showed only 5 shrimp come with the meal! I wasn't about that so I decided to try something else.   I started with a Caesar salad. I love Caesar salads. In fact, I'd say they are my favorite salads. This one was just ok. There was still a lot of water on the lettuce so the dressings kind of slid off. For my meal, I did the blackened chicken pasta. The sauce was good and the mushrooms were delicious. The downside was the chicken- there was very little of it.   This place wasn't horrible. It also wasn't great and for the price, I'd rather go elsewhere.",

Indoor and outdoor dining were available. Due to soggy weather we dined indoors at a booth next to the courtyard. Samuel our waiter was very courteous and knowledgeable about the menu when we asked a few questions. He served us efficiently and promptly. Our appetizers and entrees were delicious and prepared exactly as we had expected. The small plates were just the right amount of food and were at the proper temperature. The warm sourdough bread was a wonderful complement to our meals. I've dined at other locations of McCormack and Schmidt but fond this one to be my best experience. The ambiance was relaxed and comfortable without the stuffiness of other locations. I definitely look forward to dining here again in the near future.",

Oh I didn't know if you wanted to be seated bc the other person in your party is not here. What?!?! So I'd rather stand by the door then, right?? Or how about you ask, instead of blatantly lying.

Yes they just started their brunch menu but they we're totally under prepared for this day. My food was cold, grits were hard and the 2nd attempt (the trio) was still cold and tasteless . Doubt I'll be back. One star is bc the mgr came out and wiped all of my items off of the check. Other members of my party ate and I did not, so seems fair enough.",

It was about another 10 minutes for our server to take our drink order. He came back to take our food order before we even got our drinks. We did not get bread, although many tables around us got multiple baskets. The table next to us was seated after us and got their entree before we even got our apps. My mussels were rubbery. His soup was good. My salmon was delicious. His steak was very undercooked. The chocolate silk pie was amazing! Carrot cake was just ok. Our service was TERRIBLE. I'd expect much more from this type of dining. We saw our waiter a total of 4 times. Dirty dishes sat in front of us for extended periods of time. He brought the check with the dessert. Our water glasses were not refilled. He didn't ask if I wanted another drink. I was very underwhelmed. I'm not sure that I'd go back.",

The second, the undeniable spine shiver I get on Wednesday nights at McCormick and Shmicks. They take dollar oysters to levels I didn't think were attainable. First and foremost the Oysters are the size of Tyra Banks' forehead and I turn into a school girl on Christmas morning when the divine wait staff gallops the freshly shucked slimey miracles to the my table. If Mike Tyson lined up and punched me in the face after every oyster I ate, he would have to throw atleast 96 haymakers at me.  The vinigarette coupled with the vibrant energy from the staff makes me feel like Moses parting the sea.  Rihanna told Chris Brown that Wednesday nights at McCormick and Shmicks aren't THAT good, and now it all makes sense why he struck her. Don't take my advice see for yourself, strut on in and you will find me dining like royalty and bantering with the staff every Wednesday in the only True kingdom on earth.",

Our server was knowledgeable and patient answering our questions and making suggestions. My daughter and I ordered several appetizers and salads to share. Our sharing was accommodated readily with an extra plate brought without our having to request and no extra charge for sharing. Every morsel was delicious. We were made to  feel truly welcome and valued during our experience.  This restaurant has been consistently excellent both times we visited, in two different cities.

They catered to our grandson and brought him mac & cheese early. Even brought my husband a special birthday dessert. Our waiter, Sarah, was very attentive. We highly recommend this restaurant and we look forward to coming back for another excellent dinner here. Try the sesame crusted Ahi tuna! Yum!!",

    "text": "Out with my fiancee on a Sunday doing a little bit of shopping and just hanging out. The hunger decided to hit while strolling through the mall and what better choice than seafood.  Upon walking in the hostess was great friendly and welcoming. Offered us a choice of bar or table which I appreciated. Most places see to guys come in and automatically assume bar so that small option made a huge impact.  Once we got to our table, our waitress quickly swung by to acknowledge us and took our drink order. Unfortunately on this St Patrick's day one of their servers apparently had to much to drink tbt day before so didn't show up. Long story short, they were short staffed. Although our service was a little slow but not by much our server was fun, great & although she was running all over the place she was on it. I'm never a fan of a waitress or waiter sitting down at our table which she did but she completely made up for it. Just a very fun and spirited person.  Our food was just simply amazing. I was the greedy guy who orders 2 appetizers and an entree but our food was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. This was actually my first time going to McCormicks so what a great impression they left on me. This would have been a 5 star experience minus the small wait but overall great visit. The manager stopped by to shoot the breeze with us and she was also super funny, personable & welcoming. We'll definitely come back again to see them.  Cheers!",

The salmon was arguably the best salmon I've ever eaten outside of the house. Megan was AMAZING, the manager told us Megan was brand new and you honestly could not tell AT ALL!!! Her customer service was impeccable, her timing was literally perfect, we all always had full glasses, she made sure to check on us when necessary, and even when we forgot the dessert she didn't! We didn't wait in line, the reservation was set for 6:30 and we were seated at 6:31. I would recommend McCormick and Schmidt to my entire contact list in my phone. I will DEFINITELY BE BACK! And at this particular location! Megan you rock! Keep up the great work!!",

This location was more limited menu not quite the same set up but very nice just the same.  Manager was very friendly and our serve was amazing attentive and handled us very consistently.  I ordered a lot on the menu drinks appetizers meal and an exciting dessert.  I had the steak and lobster which was well priced but my lobsters were very small and over cooked and my meat was cooked perfectly and the server confirmed that at the table with me.  I liked that extra touch.  My pasta was very good it was the Mac n cheese really cheesy and tasty! The appetizer of shrimp wrapped in bacon my friend and I fought over! And I think I had six baskets of fresh HOT bread with perfectly creamy butter myself what a great option and it kept coming.  The dessert was the chocolate bag filled with white chocolate mousse and fresh berries it was very good with excellent presentation.  Meal was well priced and I would come again and bring out of town guests and recommend to my friends. Thank you for a great meal!",

The service, drinks, and the food was good I only took half a star because the salmon wasn't as good as I thought it would be but it was still pretty good. The apple pie and ice cream it's self was worth the whole meal. My boyfriend loves it and I thought he was being dramatic and now I am also a huge fan! I think next time I will get just the stuffed shrimp like he did I enjoyed them the most.",

Drinks were good but still semi pricy! Sat at the bar drinks came out fast.  Overall good for Happy hour, would definitely be back to try some other selections on the list.

Everything from fish tacos, chicken lettuce wraps, jumbo shrimp cocktail, cheese burgers, calamari and much more. It's a great spot to go with your girlfriends or with your spouse.  The service is consistently pleasant and attentive, the atmosphere clean and well maintained. The prices range from $3.00 to $9.00 for appetizers and you won't be disappointed.   Get there early as specials are only available in the bar area and seats go quickly.",

The food was decent but nothing special. The calamari was very tasty but my Caesar salad with shrimp was very bland. My husband although did enjoy his steak but was upset with the portion size of the 9$ mushroom side.  The drinks were standard. 10$ for a mixed drink and more pricey for specialty cocktails.  The best part of the whole meal was the service. Our server was fantastic! He was very attentive and talkative. He really made the experience much more enjoyable!  Unfortunately, I probably won't be back here any time soon. I feel like there are much better steak houses in the area that are worth the money.",

I was starting with the corn and lobster chowder but luckily I asked about the broth ingredients to learn that there's bacon in it and she no eat bacon (don't judge me, I know bacon is life blah blah blah) so the waitress kindly offered to sub for lobster bisque which technically wasn't part of the special. The bisque was very tasty with a good lobster to bisque ratio with a flavor that's not overpowered by butter or sherry...I then had the salmon stuffed with crab and shrimp with mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans...the salmon was not over cooked and the overall taste was just great which wasn't expected oh and thank you for not over or undercooking my vegetables, they were just right...I ended with the carrot cake which was just OK as it was dry but my dinner associates chocolate mouse cake was the business. I'm not a chocolate cake eater but it was delicious  and needs to be changed from chocolate mouse cake to something like chabrowny cake as it is a very dense piece of chocolatyy chocolate which may need a glass of milk or two   McCormicks did well during restaurant week and I say if you're on the hunt during this time give them a go",

I got the bone in ribeye medium, the steak came out a little undercooked but was still pretty good. I Just thought a $50 steak would be prepared better and have a little more flavor. The real kicker for me was the sides though.  Their selection is limited, and extremely expensive for what you get.  I ordered sauteed mushrooms which were nine dollars, The portion that I was served was a joke.  You would think that if they are charging nine dollars for just mushrooms they would give you a substantial portion, this wasn't the case.  Bottom line, I wasn't impressed and there is a lot of other great steak houses in Charlotte I would visit before M&S.  My wife and I spent $150 on dinner and drinks and left a little hungry and disappointed....",

My friend absolutely loved her drink which is in picture attached. It looked pretty. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was kinda tough and not grilled to my liking; was just pale and I prefer a little \"crisp\" when grilled.

Some friends invited my bf and I here because it was restaurant week and thought of it being a nice place to visit to catch up. We visited the SouthPark location although I do know they have a location downtown that I would be interested in visiting. I wish I could remember our servers name because she was so sweet but she had a very low cut fade, kind of slim. She helped a lot with providing recommendations for us one of my favorite being a mojito. I ordered the coconut curry mussels, crab and shrimp stuffed salmon, and the carrot cake. I can truly say across the board I had no problems with any of the dishes. The carrot cake was even amazing even with its coconut shavings which I typically hate. I definitely plan on revisiting and cannot wait for the day I do.",

About 10 minutes later we tracked down our elusive waitress and asked for the check and did not order dinner. Left and went to Del Frescoes...in addition to great beef their seafood is exceptional.

Without requesting, we were seated in a very private both that even had a curtain that could be drawn. Score!  I started with the crab cake as an appetizer and was pleased. The meat was softer than I was accustomed too but the lack of a lot of filler made it a winner. The portion for the appetizer is one medium-sized cake.   You can get seafood wasted here so it's the perfect spot for the True seafood fan. I chose lobster-stuffed shrimp and grilled vegetables. The shrimp were very good, amply stuffed with sweet lobster meat. I was so afraid the dish would arrive with three shrimp and was pleasantly surprised to have five or six!  I did not have room for dessert but was treated to a very tasty, brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and a celebratory candle. The perfect end to a perfect birthday meal.",

    "text": "Exceptional restaurant in Charlotte and much better than a lot of the locally owned ones.  Service was outstanding, as was the food.  Here's a rundown of our order.  Starters Steamed Littleneck Clams--These are fantastic and are bathing in a garlic/herb cream sauce that you will hang onto to sop your bread up with.  Very fresh clams and a decent portion for a starter--about 15 clams. Raw Oysters--I had a tasting menu of 3 varieties and found the Canadian oysters the best.  My favorite was the Beau Rivage.  Some of the oysters were very undersized and some were oversized.  It would be nice if they evened out the sizes for sharing reasons.  Mains Blackened Mahi-Mahi...the fish in the dish was fantastic.  The sauce was a bit too much I felt and dominated the fish.  It was a spicy tomato sauce.  Would not order again.  The rice side was also dismal. Sea Bass-Perfect.  This is the opposite of the mahi mahi because in this dish the fish is the star and not the sauce...although the gremolata butter is subtle and fantastic.  Sides of mash and asparagus and carrots were great.  Truly a great plate of food.  Dessert Apple Upside Down Pie....fantastic.  Will disappear in less than 5 minutes guaranteed.  This is a really nice restaurant that does most things right.  I look forward to going back and trying more of the menu.  All the ingredients are super fresh and I think I would recommend ordering something that is light on the sauce and stars the fresh seafood.",

    "text": "What a mediocre experience. Several times we have walked past M&S on our way into the mall and said, oh we should go there for dinner. That dinner finally happened a couple of Fridays ago.   Things started out fine. The host was friendly and we were seated in a cute little booth behind the bar, which offered a nice sense of privacy which is often lost in restaurants trying to cram in too many tables and forcing patrons to sit basically on top of each other (side rant over). That was about the end of the pleasantries.    We sat for an unusually long time before someone came to take our drink order. I was willing to let that go and start the beginning of a nice meal with the husband. We just wanted to start with a cocktail and work our way from there. Keep in mind, the place was not busy and it was always my understanding that waiters liked having table with more alcohol on their tabs- ours seemed frustrated that we were not ready/willing to order our entire meal at this point.   Anyway, as we wait for our drinks we decided to order a \"jumbo\" shrimp cocktail to split as an appetizer, which we did when she arrived with our drinks. It came out super quick and had to have been the smallest shrimp I have seen in a long time. I understand that things happen and you can't always control the size but these babies were, well baby sized.   Somewhere in this mix we also ordered our main meals. As we quickly finished our app, since there wasn't much to it, we also finished our first drink (as well as the accompanying water). And then we waited, and waited and waited until I finally stood up to go and find the waitress who suddenly appeared at that time- with our food.   Now I am left sitting with no drink and my food on the table and had to decide, do I go ahead and eat my steak w/out my wine or do I wait for my drink and let me food get cold. I went with the former, which proved to be a good choice b/c it took an unreal amount of time for the waitress to return with our wine and then retreat to not be seen again until it was time to pay the check.   I decided to get up and use the ladies and at that point saw that our waitress was busy sitting in another booth with a co-worker gossiping, which is where I can only imagine she was the entire time since the restaurant wasn't very busy at all.   It was such a disappointing experience. Shame on me for not complaining while we were there, but I recall a manager coming to the table to ask how things were and the response being \"the food is fine.\" which I would have thought was a sign of a problem.   There are too many other good places around to go back and give this place a lot of my hard earned money for such a headache in return.",

It was the service that wasn't. He reassured me he would speak with Karen and that his focus would be just to help her improve not discipline her for her actions. That's all I'd ever ask for.

Any ideas?  Anyone?  Bueller?  Anyway, they have a non-printed lunch menu that's updated frequently in addition to the standard fare items.  Obviously known for their fish and seafood, but I went with a buffalo chicken salad this visit and I wasn't disappointed with my choice.

Some of the oysters were on the smaller side for blue points and pretty gritty, the muscles were great and the sauce very good and they were served in large portions. For entree's I had the seared scallops they were very good and cooked just right. My husband had the ultimate grill the menu did not mention wether it came with a side or not and the waiter did not know so we ordered 2 large al'a cart sides (each side is enough for 2 people but my husband works out a lot and can eat so no biggie there) anyway the food did come with a side, 2 actually so that really was not necessary. We did have to send my husbands salmon back twice as it was raw in the middle. ( please note : we eat out a lot and don't over cook our food. I also cook salmon at home about twice a week and we are sushi lovers so this was just a matter of the food not being prepared well). The desert was delicious, we had the chocolate box more than enough for 2 and it was great in every way. I had a couple of martinis, my husband 2 glasses of wine and a scotch with desert. We are not afraid to spend money when we got out or we would eat at Friday's but as we like to eat at quality places and try it all. Our tab was a little over $200, just to give you an idea.. It was mediocre at best we wanted to eat at the up town location but it was closed for super bowl Sunday. I enjoyed it because I always enjoy a date with my husband but would not recommend this location and will probably not re-visit. Hope this helps.",

    "text": "Horrible food. Went Easter Sunday for brunch. Food took an excessive amount of time even though the place was less than 1/2 full. Shrimp and grits- the shrimp was way overdone and wife's eggs Benedict were cold. Told server and they replaced the egg dishes, which came out just as bad. Never saw a manager even after telling the server how poor food was. 100$ meal was worth 4.99$ at Denny's and that's being nice. Too many places to eat that are much better especially at that price point to go to this place.",

However, when I ordered the cranberry juice it was a bit watered down and the waitress was kind enough to replace with a coke.  The silverware wasn't clean and the peach cobbler was simply a bowl of just five peaches.  I really wasn't expecting this and asked the waitress to remove the peach cobbler from the bill.  The waitress (Chemine) was absolutely amazing!!! However, my overall experience was just ok...I will visit again but definitely a different location and hopefully they will get 5 stars..",

Usually they offer free dessert for a birthday, and this waiter couldn't get us out fast enough. He also never refilled our drinks. Going to Brio's next time!",

The last few times we have eaten here, including last years veterans event the food has been mediocre at best.  Last year we spoke with the dining room manager, Melissa.  She listened to our comments and said she was working on improving the food and service.  This year the food was amazing.  It was hot and cooked as described.  We again spoke with Melissa, this time to tell her how much we enjoyed the meal and service.  She was True to her word and has fixed the issues.  If you haven't tried the restaurant for a while, give it another chance.  I know we'll be back!",

We get seated, order drinks.  10 minutes later we get water and bread and order appetizers. 10 minutes later our drinks finally arrive. 10 minutes later spoke with the manager.  With the help of another waiter we were finally able to order our meals. Shortly after that our appetizers finally arrive. Calamari was chewy and improperly prepared. Received our entrees in about 20 minutes. Some enjoyed their meal,  others had to be returned because of undercooked meat. Returned after re-cooking,  meat still was improperly cooked. No one's water glasses were ever refilled.  No one was asked for another drink. Had to ask waiter for additional bread. If this review sounds choppy, that's exactly how our experience went,  not very smooth.   It was very inconsistent throughout the dining experience. Needless to say I was underwhelmed by almost everything. I will never go there again.",

    "text": "Although a seafood restaurant chain, McCormick & Schmick's is not only fun to say like a good tongue twister, it's also many steps above Red Lobster.  As you walk in their doors, you feel like you're walking into an upscale restaurant, but it's actually a very casual place, making it comfortable for everyone (although some decorum of dress should be taken).    What I love about McCormick & Schmick is that although I have a slight idea of what I may be craving for dinner, the menu is ever-changing based on what's \"fresh\" and it could be prepared in a variety of methods.   My seared ahi tuna may be prepared one way during one visit and then a totally different way on another.  I've never had a disappointing entree and love trying new creations on their menu.    If you're on a budget or just want something light as you meet up with friends after a day of work or shopping (seriously, though--which is tougher?), you can sit at the bar, order drinks and pick food items from their bar menu with prices ranging from $1.95 (yes, one dollar and ninety-five cents) to $3.95.  Granted, the choices don't include one of their delicious seafood entree concoctions, but they're still tasty and filling nonetheless.",
