Our current favorites are the curry chicken, the thai chicken, and the maple dream but next time we go, I'm trying something on the veggie side. It's a simple concept and they execute it perfectly! Don't be afraid to ask for things on the side (like maple syrup). The service is excellent too with really friendly staff and a clean and quaint sitting area.",

We had to wait for 10 minutes for a table to open up but our server was so accomodating. He found a table that was comfortable for our family and was so apologetic for us waiting. The food is delicious and the staff is attentive. We would definitely go back again and I would definitely bring out of town family here for brunch!",

The local owners bring a much-needed unique and delicious option to those of us pining for something more than just 'getting by' in over-franchised suburbia.  This is like the Viva Chicken of breakfast/brunch -- it never gets old, the menu is deeeeeep in goodness and the service is great.    They have completely aced the recipe for the crepes that are the backbone of the menu, and have a very well-thought out variety of savory and sweet options that hit a broad cross section of tastes. Crepes aren't quick and they're easily botched, but these folks have their recipe and their process down pat so that the wait times are fine, the quality is high and highly consistent ... it's a reasonable price point that is well worth the hand-crafted treat for your mouth and your tummy (yes, the savory varieties are filling).  I only hope the owners are already looking for more space (or maybe an additional nearby location), because I predict this place is going to get overrun!",

So to walk in and not have a single staff either acknowledge you or  direct you to where to order, sets the tone.  As it was our first time, we asked for recommendations, not sure why that was so difficult. The staff had no recommendations, just the blanket, \"everything is good\" response. That answer always makes me worried, how to you work somewhere and have no opinion?   We settled on the Americana and the samosa. The samosa was tasty, the Americana had processed turkey meat (like the rounds from the plastic packages at Walmart.) Not what you would expect for $9....I mean at least go to the deli and get shaved turkey meat.  The food was good, the service was not. Overall, an unsatisfactory experience.   I do not recommend this pace and I would not go back.",

    "text": "We've been coming for months, most Saturday mornings. Kids crepe at almost $6 is a bit high for what they get but the quality is good. I'm afraid we pay for the novelty of it, which is a concern for their future - because we like it very much. Unfortunately, their coffee isn't very good (or fresh, or promoted) or else we'd come much more often. I think they would do very well with some packages, like including a soda/juice with a kids crepe, for $.50 more, instead of offering everything a la carte. Same with the coffee - if the coffee was paid attention to and there was a \"crepe and coffee\" special, I'd jump at it most mornings. I don't know what goes on here during lunch, I've never been. It might is amazing. Again, the quality is really good and fresh ingredients, so it's probably good. The kids really like it here.",

My only issue with the place is the seating situation. It is a small restaurant so they don't have a lot of space to work with. The employees were constantly sliding tables around to accommodate the patrons coming in. We were asked to move our seats and slide our table to one side and the other as people came and left. The tables were practically right on top of each other so when it is busy you feel like you are sitting really close to the people next to you. It was chaotic to say the least. I enjoyed the food and the style of the restaurant was nice, but this is not a good place to bring groups. 2-4 people tops! It is way too small and too busy for more than that. I felt like I had to eat and get up fast because there were lots of people waiting for us to leave so they could sit down. Overall, I would come here again. I thought the food and the price was good. I just really hope they figure out a better seating situation so the dining experience could be more enjoyable.",

    "text": "I love this place! Here's why: They listen. I have been several times, and they have crepes that range from sweet to savory. There are \"breakfast\" options with eggs, \"lunch\" items with chicken pesto and \"dessert\" crepes with lemon, etc. I have always had excellent service and food. My daughter has a slight allergy to hazelnut/nutella, so they leave that item off and give her extra whipped cream. Niccccce.   The listening part? When I first went there, I noticed there weren't any highchairs. This location is family-oriented and the bench seats do not have breaks in them. What that means is that kiddos can literally crawl from one end of the restaurant to the other. I like kids, I have two. But, I know their parents may freak out that their child can become an unexpected guest at someone else's table. By my next visit, I noticed highchairs. I'd like to think I was the catalyst for this, but the manager let me know that it was \"in the works.\"  Also, I have never had a wrong order. That's something! The pagers will scare you senseless with how loud they are when they beep, but hey, at least you know your food's ready, right? This is just a \"don't freak out\" warning for those of you who are sound sensitive.  My advice: Try anything on the menu. It's all good. Over the last year or so, my friends and I have tried each thing and have not found a dud yet.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "location: conveniently near other stores and restaurants  parking: on weekends, terrible. you might have to park somewhere across the shopping center  ambience: casual, clean, brightly lit  service: friendly. you order at the counter first and wait for your buzzer to light up. probably only waited about 5 mins and the place was pretty busy.  food: good! hard to mess up a crepe but the ingredients seemed fresh and well-proportioned. I don't like a ton of stuff in my crepes so I ordered off the kids menu. the crepes are the same size. I got the one+one, mozz cheese+ egg. simple and classic. my friends enjoyed their savory ones as well. decently filling, but I could've gone for an additional desert crepe too.   notes: this place is pretty small / narrow and seating is limited. also, they only use disposable plates, utensils, and cups (that you grab yourself) I don't think it'd be that hard to use non-disposable ones? especially since most people eat inside the restaurant I feel. also, I wish they invested in good coffee and espresso drinks",

I had the chipotle chicken, and crepe was just so light and delicious, and the filling with chicken and salad was so fresh! Also tried the chicken basil, equally delicious. Food comes out pretty quick considering they make it fresh in front of you.   Plenty of room to sit inside and eat for groups of 4, and some tables outside. They use beepers to let you know when it's ready. Wish they had a place like this up in NY. Already want to go here again, try this place!",

    "text": "Great little creperie! My wife and I ate here for the first time on a Saturday morning at 8:30 after reading the excellent Yelp reviews and will definitely return. We split the Chevre & Mozz breakfast crepe for $8.75 (loaded with Egg, Mozzarella, Bacon, Mushrooms, Red Onion, Kalamata Olives & Goat Cheese) and the Berry Delight sweet crepe for $8.50 (Strawberries, Goat Cheese & Crushed Walnuts Drizzled With Honey, Topped With Powdered Sugar).   This salty and sweet combo was a perfect breakfast mix and the goat cheese on both was a highlight for us. (For those goat cheese haters/skeptics... just give it a try, I dare you!) Unlike other small creperies, this one has six creperie stones which ensured a quick delivery of our order. The crepes themselves are superb and the eclectic mic of ingredients are fresh nicely distributed. We were skeptical about the coffee but it also turned out to be quite good at $2.65 a cup.  Seating is a little tight but it's available inside and out. Atmosphere is simple but clean and attractive. The young crew that was working were focused on their job and were friendly. Sanitation score was a 98 and, being sticklers on the topic, we were pleased to witness them all to be very conscientious hand washers and glove wearers and off their cell phones (don't laugh, that last one has become very nasty, yet overlooked, problem.)  Although I rarely do this after only one visit, I can't find any reason not to give it 5 stars. I'm not quite ready to call it one of my Gotta Tries, but I'm close. That will depend on my next visit, which will be soon.   sweet crepe",

It was dusted with powdered sugar, but yet was not too sweet - possibly the addition of walnuts and feta cheese kept the balance.  Ate outside at one of the tables and had a nice relaxing break from the world.  Inside, it does feel a little like a fast food place.",
