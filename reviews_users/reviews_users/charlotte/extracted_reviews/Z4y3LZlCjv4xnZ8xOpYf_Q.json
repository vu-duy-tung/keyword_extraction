    "text": "Stars all around for being True to their name.. The pizza was fantastic!  Light, crispy crust... chewy cheese... we had the broccoli raab and sausage pie and it descended to our bar seats fresh from the oven like an angel.  I wish I lived closer to here to make this joint a regular.  Other dishes we had were fine, tho not the star.. the calamari with jalapenos had  a little fire, but not a lot of bite, the Caesar salad lacked kick too.. anchovies?  Didn't see them.  Dressing was minimal, if any.   But oh, the gelato made up for that too.. fantastic, authentic, creamy love scooped right from heaven. One other unique feature of this place... the way it works... you get in line to order your food BEFORE you seat yourself.. so they've done away with waiters and replaced them with runners, UNLESS you choose to sit at the ample bar (which we did) in which case the bartender tends to you directly.  Our approach had three advantages. - 1.  Maybe the best local IPA I've had  2.  The pizza prep and cooking show is worth viewing  (from assembly to the oven or grilles to the guy that cuts them up to the runner...they've got it down!), and 3.  No waiting in line for the bar.",

The dipping sauce for the risotto balls was so flavorful. And the salad was perfectly dressed. We shared the broccoli rabe and sausage pizza. So sad to see it go!  My husband never eats the crust and he did not leave anything on his plate with this pizza. Definitely worth the drive and we will be back!",

    "text": "5 Stars Service:  Everyone was very friendly and answered all questions regarding the menu and details about the restaurant.  This is casual dining, so you order and sit down; however the staff came by our table many times to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed.   Grilled Pizzas: Holy crap, the grilled pizza was unreal.  We got the house made pesto pizza with bell peppers and onions.  The flavor was fresh, the dough was much lighter than any other pizza I've had and the portion was large enough for two people to get their fill.    4 Stars: Ambience:  I really like the set up, very reminiscent of Brixx's but still unique.  They have a bar in the middle, booths on one side, and a long wooden table in the front for big groups.  The second time my girlfriend and I went, they were projecting a video about Italy on a side wall (this seemed odd and the sound was off so it didn't serve much of a purpose).   Mozzarella Wedges: I love it when restaurants serve wedges instead of sticks because they usually have more cheese in them.  They could certainly use a little more salt but they were very appetizing.  3 Stars:  True Traditional Pizza:  Maybe this speaks to how good our experience has been but this was the only thing about the restaurant that made me go \"ehh.\"  The pizza was good but it was very bready and the toppings were very light for $1 a topping.  The difference between this pizza and the grilled pizza was enormous.  I also felt like it was less food for more money.    Overall, I love this place.  I still want to try the oven baked pizzas and the home made gelato but I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh new pizza experience in South Charlotte.  It looks like they have a good local beer selection to so I am eager to try that one weekend.  Bottom Line: Get the grilled pizza!",

    "text": "I'm a pizza obsessive, and I'm always looking for great pizza.  I finally got around to trying TRUE pizza and here's my thoughts.  Neapolitan Style- not traditional in any way, but a fantastic artisan crust that really could have bumped my rating to a five star had it not been for a really poor tomato sauce that ruined the experience.  It was strange, wanting to continue eating a pizza because you look forward to the snap and flavor of the crust only to be deterred from taking another bite because of the bad sauce.  The sauce was so displeasing that I could not finish the pie.  Grilled Pizza- Another crust win with a unique crispy and salty crust that you can't find anywhere else in Charlotte.  The toppings of the House made pesto pizza just didn't do it for me.  I wanted to like this pizza more, but the toppings lacked brightness and flavor.  It was sort of a great crust with colorful yet bland toppings.  Surprising because pesto and peppers should have tons of individual flavor.  I didn't care for their sausage.   The ambiance is great, what a cool interior.  Unfortunately, neither pizza left me with a desire to come back.  I see elements of greatness, but the overall flavor was disappointing.  I like that they are unique and I hope they continue to work at improving their product.  I will try again down the road cause I really want to see places like this show this city that non-chain establishments are where it's at.",

    "text": "Excellent meal. We had a pepperoni pizza, ham and pineapple pizza and a chicken parm sandwich which came with some of the best coleslaw I've ever had.  The pizza crust was crunchy and chewy and not too thick. The chicken sandwich was cooked well with a good sauce, not overwhelmed by the cheese and served on a nice sesame seed roll. Seems kind of weird to over emphasize the side dish but the coleslaw was delicious. It was a vinegar-based slaw with another ingredient that just made it pop. Good place to go before or after a movie.",

    "text": "I came here with my husband before seeing a movie at Regal on a Monday night. For a Monday it was pretty busy, but it's also Summer and 75% of the people there was a large group of teenage girls.   When you initially walk in, you need to know that you order up front. There isn't a waitress to seat you and take your order, and it's not very intuitive, so just be aware.   We ordered the Pepperoni Pizza, the mozzarella wedges, a cup of tomato soup, and my husband got an Old Meck Copper. Our total was $26.   The pizza is a \"personal size\" meaning that it's about 10inches. My husband and I shared, and we had enough. Would probably be enough for a couple with a small child, but any more, you would need 2 pizzas. I like the fact that you can tell the pizza is handmade because of the crust. However, when I get to the crust, I kind of want to skip it, because I would like a dipping sauce. Their sauce is good, and there is a lot of flour-y crust to be had.   The mozzarella wedges were not great. The cheese was a little too runny, and if we got there a second time maybe we will try out the meatballs.   The tomato soup was also not my favorite. I was expecting it to be more creamy, but it reminded me of their marinara sauce, which kind of weirded me out.   And for a Monday, they didn't have any drink specials. They also don't have any ciders. Both, something I hope they pick up in the future.",

Although it did have the upper hand from the beginning... with my friend being an employee who also happened to serve us tonight (it's who you know not what you know, right? joking, people)... I still see a major improvement here from every life force that inhabited it before and would give it major props even if I had had no preconceived ideas about it's past lives.  The set up is smooth and practical- walk in, order, sit down, have drinks, check out the video projector or whatever entertainment catches your eye, get food that is delicious- no funny business involved.  Though I have only so far tried the ceasar salad and pepperoni pizza, though these could easily be two main staples that define the essence of any pizza place, I can finally say  that alas the South Charlotte area has a great local pizza restaurant.  From the sophisticated yet not overly done ambience to the thickness of crust, there are zero regrets here.  P.S.- if you make it to TRUE during this season, order the Pumpkin Ale... hoppy and delicious",

There appeared to be at least 10 staff people that I could see.  This would obviously not include the ones in the back.  It was a very slow time and not a lot going on so getting service should not have been so challenging.  We watched as staff stood around chatting and hanging out.  We attempted to make eye contact while we were there to get service but were completely ignored.   Just getting our order in and drinks took 15 minutes and there was no one ahead of us.   During our brief lunch we each had to get up to find an employee for a drink refill.  I only right a complaint if things are REALLY bad.  This one definitely qualifies",

Well, let me tell you that I was so shocked when me and my diehard Guinea boyfriend took a bite of the True Traditional Tomato and mozzarella pizza! I thought I was home again. The crust was a little charred and chewy, yummo!! The tomato sauce was so fresh and the mozzarella was melted and stringy. Perfection!!!. I order the Prosciutto Di Parma with Arugula, fig preserve, parmesan, and asiago. The prosciutto was sliced a little too thick, tho. OMG!! Theyre killin me!! But, that went home with us, because I kept eating the regular pie. Salad was boring, too much oregano, bland iceberg, but whoda hell cares???  My pizza was the shit!!!! I spoke to the chef who told me he was from Connecticut, close to New York so that explained the deliciousness and authenticity of his pizza. True Crafted are True Pizza Artisans.

    "text": "To get an explanation of the restaurant, read prior reviews, I will save my fingers the typing in that regard.  This place is where Anzi's pizza used to be in the Stonecrest shopping center.  Went with my GF, we got: -rizzoto cheese balls with marinara as an appetizer -original round pie with pancetta, mushrooms, black olives, sausage, and mozz. -square grilled pizza with pepperoni and mozz. -2 soft drinks $38.xx  Rizzoto balls were awesome.  You could make a restaurant based solely on these!  I would love options to add toppings into these...bacon bits or mushrooms or something.  They are great though.  The marinara was good, needs more salt though to make the taste pop.  Round pie:  Amazing taste, pancetta used very sparingly though (not worth the $2.00), crust too poofy for the size of the pie.  I felt like the slices were 70% topped, 30% dough.  These pie's need to come with complimentary marinara dip sauce so I have something for all that crust.  It's great tasting crust, but I'm hungry for pizza not bread.  Pizza ends up being more of an 7\" pie when you get all that crust outta the way.  Taste was amazing....value just not there.  You basically have a little personal NY style pizza with a bunch of soft poofy crust....I need 2 of those to fill me up...but not at $8.50 each pre-topped...sorry.  Square grilled pie:  Crust lighter and chewier.  I loved it.  Toppings go all the way out to the edge of the pie which is awesome...however the amount of cheese was very lacking.  Note to self; always add extra cheese as a topping and hope that gets you to the perceived amount of cheese that the round one has.  The pepperoni was AMAZING.  I'm fairly sure its the same smoked pepperoni that Portofinos uses....(which is my favorite pizza in Charlotte BTW).  Sauce was nice, had some nice big chunks of crushed tomato.  This pizza is the one to get assuming you order it with extra cheese and a bunch of toppings.  Fountain drinks:  Syrup to water ratio could be tweaked, the Coke was a bit watery and as I've noticed with restaurants who do this...the city water taste is even more noticeable.    Price:  Kinda steep for a novelty concept.    Service:  Awesome!!  The girl at the counter walked us through the concept and the process.  Other staffers would walk around and check on you, very friendly, pretty smiles, showed sincerity and seemed to enjoy their jobs.  This place does not have a spot on the receipts to write in a tip.  I'm sure a tip isn't necessary since they don't really \"wait on\" you, just run your food out and then clear the table (ala Showmars, etc)...so I felt guilty that I didn't even have a dollar on me to give the table clearing staff since they were so friendly.  I definitely plan on coming back here....I feel this place could be amazing if the perceived value was increased by making a few tweaks as mentioned above (less crust size on the round pie, more cheese on the grilled, more syrup in the drinks, complimentary dip sauces for round pie's crust).  Parmesan cheese in the shakers is high quality real cheese also...very tasty.  Owner was there helping out, looks like a nice guy.",

    "text": "Are you kidding me? This pizza is truly amazing....any negative reviewer of this place likely calls The Olive Garden or Applebees their favorite restaurant.   Let me start off by saying my family is Italian. We make pasta and dough from scratch, buy our 00 flour from Italy, have immediate family in Italy, take an entire day to make sauce from our garden tomatoes and fresh basil.   We just went to Italy this summer and we made it a point to eat pizza everyday at some point. Sounds excessive but a margherita pizza in Italy is about 5 euro and it's a smaller portion than we have here so my wife and I would split one during second breakfast or 3rd lunch or one of the other 10 meals we ate each day.   This is by far the closest to Italy that we've had in Charlotte and maybe the states.   I first tried their pizza from their food truck at my son's school and was really impressed, then we went to the restaurant a few weeks ago and now I'm hooked.   These guys take their time to let the dough rest and buy great flour. Obviously cooking the pizza at 700-800 degrees also is a key, which these guys do as well. I like a lot of different pizza places in Charlotte so I'm not a hater of \"american\" style pizza but if you want amazing, authentic Italian pizza then you've got to go here.",

After ordering a pizza to split with my date and sitting down, I placed my numbered table marker on its designated stand and waited. And waited. After a while an employee approached and asked if we were still waiting for anything and I told him we had been waiting for our pepperoni pizza. He said he would check on that and I watched him go retrieve our pizza from a shelf near the back of the cooking area. I'm assuming the pizza had been sitting there unattended for a long time because it arrived at the table room temperature. I'm not sure what happened there. I never moved seats and I made sure the table marker was clearly visible on its stand at the center of our table. As if eating overpriced room temperature pizza wasn't bad enough, half way through my second slice I chomped down on a piece of soft plastic that had been baked into my pizza. As a rule I never complain to management at restaurants but had I not been on a date I would surely have made an exception to that rule.",

Started with risotto balls, which were cheesy and delicious and a caesar salad - the dressing was great, a little lemony and definitely homemade.  My husband had the bacon and clam pizza and I had a margarita with meatball - highly recommend both of these.  Value for money was excellent, we took home leftovers which were fantastic the next day.  I purposely sat at the bar so we could get full service and the bartender was great.  We will definitely be back to try more of the menu.",

    "text": "4 solid stars. Not the most likely spot for a great pizza place as Stonecrest tends to be ruled by chains and easygoing eateries. Happy to say that TRUE is truly....pretty damn good. The interior is a little tightly packed, but gorgeous. Killer bar, plenty of booths, tables, and a great patio. We came in for an early-ish dinner to check it out.   It's a walk-up situation. Walk in, go to the counter with a nicely sized menu above, order, and grab a seat with number in hand. There are a few options when it comes to pizza -- traditional style, grilled pizzas, and oven-baked. We checked out the traditional cheese and the grilled pesto pizza.   A few notes: the grilled pesto pizza was awesome. Good amount of char on the bottom, killer grilled flavor, tasty veggies, pungent pesto, a dusting of parm, and not-so symmetrical shape. I think we both could have gone for a well-done crust, but it was still awesome. The cheese pizza was good, but also was lacking just a bit in the doneness of the crust. Though, we are both fans of blackened crust(s) on pizza.   We also checked out the mozz wedges as an app. Where they didn't blow me away, the cheese was perfectly gooey and flavorful. I was curious if they were making it in-house.   Another huge plus, they have a nicely organized grouping of local brews -- OMB, Birdsong, Triple C, and NoDa. Went with a few pints of Jalapeno pale and CoCo LoCo.   Pricepoint is rather fair. Can't argue too much with two pizzas, an app, and two beers for $30.   I'm looking forward to heading back really soon.   Another plus: The men's restroom smells like cookies and, for that, I am thankful.",

I ordered the gluten free four cheese pizza with bacon. The flavor was great! I didn't give 5 stars because the crust could've been cooked a little longer. The pizza would flop down when I would pick up a slice and I prefer my crust to be firm and have a little crunch to it. Also, my mom ordered the calamari and said it was a bit saltier then usual. Overall I was happy & would definitely come back again!",

We were trying to make an 8pm movie and once the owner heard that he let us know that he put our order in front of others so we could get out on time.  Very kind and thoughtful.  We tried the BLT grilled pizza as recommended by the cashier.  It was okay but not great.  I was a little disappointed because I thought the crust would be crispy but this was more doughy and soft than I expected.  There wasn't enough bacon and the bacon that was on there was more fatty than crispy so that wasn't exactly exciting.  The sauce was a ranch dressing which was very good but it almost made the bread soggy so I'm not sure that was the best route.  It was basically a salad on bread..which I guess I should have seen coming.  I think I would order one of the marina or pesto based pizzas next time.  I will say that I loved the smoky flavor from the pizza being grilled.  I definitely want to come back and try something different!  I also tried the side of house-made meatballs.  They were great!!  They didn't come with very much marinara sauce but they had some mozzarella on top and they had very good flavor.  You could tell they were very fresh.    I think True has a good thing going and I will support them.  They also serve a few gelato flavors, beer and wine.    I wouldn't say it is the most affordable place for \"faster\" food but they aren't too bad.   Give them a shot!",

    "text": "All pizzas are personal pizzas if you try hard and believe in yourself.    Located at Stonecrest, at the end near City Tavern, in a spot that has been a couple of other pizza places, the interior of True Crafted is definitely an upgrade from the former tenants.  When you walk in, to your right you will order at the counter and get a number to put on your table for delivery.  They have booths, a long wooden family style table, chair seating and bar seating.  The pizza special for the day today was an 11\" white pizza with asparagus, mushrooms, broccoli, ricotta, mozzarella and red pepper flakes.  I ordered the special without mushrooms with a Coke to drink (yay Coke products!) and it was just over $12.    I love, love, love white pizza.  This, I did not love.  I do not like for the ricotta to be in globs on the pizza, which this was.  It's a personal preference, and not a reflection of a bad tasting pizza.  The crust was thin and crunchy without being hard.  The broccoli was cooked through as was the asparagus.  The red pepper flakes were a little heavy in some places on the pizza, but overall it was well balanced.    The wait staff delivers your food and checks a few times to see if you need refills and see if everything is okay.  I found them all to be pleasant and helpful.  A couple of gentlemen, that I believe to be the owners and/or the chef(s) after seeing their webpage, were walking around the restaurant checking on people as well.  I did like that the restaurant seemed to be kid/family friendly without catering specifically to children, thus alienating those of us who don't want to listen to some guy making balloon animals while trying to eat.    The execution of the pizza was fine, I just didn't particularly care for this pizza.  I will go again and try a regular cheese pizza and will update my review then.",

I won't write too much here (I blogged, with pictures, here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2Fx7InUm&s=49b7b3a0ab727bf7b7b1bfd2e03bcf69a245ac3d37556bd15200f56acf657974\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">is.gd/x7InUm</a>), but our overall experience was excellent. For Charlotte, this really is about as good as it gets and our only regret is that we're 25 minutes from the location!  For those looking for a nice atmosphere, high quality pizza (with great local beers), and good service (thanks for stopping by to say hi, Todd), try TRUE Crafted pizza. You won't regret it.  (Also, as a bonus, a date night reverse happened - my wife was distracted from our conversation by the female equivalent of sports - old black and white movies on a projection screen with Jimmy Stewart. Well played, TRUE. Well played.)",

The first two sold nondescript pizza in a nondescript setting, but TRUE tries to change that a bit by incorporating new decor in a fast-casual setting. The new decor is so much better than what it used to be--the place is gorgeous. It now has a bar in the middle, and a darker, more calming color scheme compared to the whites, greens, and reds of the last few places.   We placed our order at the counter, which was a cheese pizza and a meatball hero. We decided to sit outside, and the food came out in about 15 minutes. The meatball hero was okay, although I wouldn't order it again. The meatball itself didn't do it for me and the sandwich didn't come out hot either. The pizza, though, was quite good. It may have been a little heavy on the cheese, but it had a nice crust and crunch, and was overall a solid pizza. The pie was enough to feed one and a half people.  The service was very good--the employees were personable and they seemed to be happy to be doing their jobs. The location is also very good--Stonecrest is always busy and they will likely see a lot of traffic on weekends. Overall, I'd go back, it's solid pizza in a good spot.",

    "text": "In the summer of 2012, three families got together with the goal of creating the best pizza restaurant in Charlotte, NC. In their quest to create the \"best\" pizza, they traveled from New York to San Francisco, from New Haven to Los Angeles, and virtually everywhere in between in search of the perfect pizza. At TRUE Crafted Pizza, they take an artisan's approach to making pizza. With help from Harry Peemoeller, a renowned baker/professor at Johnson & Wales University (one of Ella's former instructors), they developed what they believe to be a perfect pizza dough recipe.  The menu features two distinct styles of pizza, the Traditional Oven Baked Pizza and the Signature Grilled Pizzas. This second type of pizza is unique to TRUE Crafted Pizza and is not offered anywhere else in Charlotte. We love unique flavors and if TRUE is the only place in the Queen City offering grilled pizzas then the decision on what we were going to order was pretty obvious. We started with the Crispy Risotto Fritters with creamy fontina cheese and fresh herbs, and then we split the Grilled BLT Pizza with bacon, grilled romaine lettuce, tomato with ranch dressing.  The risotto fritters were addictive, artery clogging, and smile inducing fried balls of risotto dripping with fontina cheese. The grilled blt pizza was delicious but we thought there might have been a little too much lettuce. So much lettuce that the pizza felt more like a giant salad than a grilled pizza. We loved TRUE crafted pizzas and can easily recommend you stopping by the next time you have a pizza craving in South Charlotte.",

    "text": "Toggled between a 3 and a 4 star review.  I decided upon the 4 star because it's a place I'd come back to when I'm in the area.  Come to the Charlotte area for a weekend at Carowinds. We wanted pizza and saw the sign off the interstate for it so we stopped. A little disfunction on the set up on the way in bc we needed time to look at the menu but we were blocking the people behind us.  Pizza was good, price was ehhh. I thought $10- $15 for an 11 inch pizza is a bit much. We also tried the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was also amazing but again the price of $8 seems a bit much.  Restaurant was clean and modern. Service was nothing to buzz about,  but nothing to complain either. It was also 915 on a Saturday night so not much expectation. The lady that brought us our plates for pizza was kind enough to exchange the dirty plate out without grumble.  So we'd probably visit again if we were in the mood for a pizza while we were in the area.",

There's usually a reason for that - Trust where the people are. My son loved their kids pizzas and actually eats the whole thing...(he doesn't do that anywhere else).  Updated review: Quality and consistency seems to have taken a downturn. I've gotten several BURNT pizzas without an apology or acknowledgement - I gave it several tries to pick up, but unfortunately we are done for awhile. It's overloaded with pre-teens on weekends and  the staff seems abrupt, snobby and uninterested. (Except one woman who seems to be the most genuine about helping and caring for the place but she can't run the whole restaurant).",

They have beers on tap and a decent wine selection. I love this place. It's out in stone crest but worth the drive! You can grab a movie after or go to marble slab for dessert",

This probably because the staff does not get compensated by most customer tipping. There was no place to tip on my credit card receipt, so I left cash on the table.      The house salad toppings was nice, but the simple red wine vinegar dressing was not. They should upgrade to a more refined vinaigrette.     The highlight of the meal wasn't the pizza, but the calamari appetizer. It was nicely fried to perfection. The cost of the meal was $50.00 plus my cash  tip. So  not the greatest value for what we received for our meal.",

    "text": "Since the Ballantyne Wellness Fair when they had their Food Truck out passing out free samples, i've been craving to return. Today I finally made it in and ordered Take Out. The menu was a bit confusing if you ask me. What's the difference between a Traditional Pizza, a Speciality Oven Baked Pie & a Signature Grilled Pizza I asked. They must get this question all of the time because I was told that technically there are only two types of pizza & he pulls out 2 pizza paddles and says one is round and has a crust, the other is square and doesn't have the crust. Why not just put this on the menu? I'd rather that than receive a presentation every time I forget. But anyway I placed my order, Grilled Pepperoni Pizza with Extra Pepperoni, Calamari no Jalapenos and Cheese Wedges. As I waited I was offered a complimentary drink. The staff is very attentive. I was constantly checked on and assured my order was coming up. Not only by the person who checked me out, but by everyone else as well. I received my order and opened everything to check it before I left, where's the extra pepperoni?!?! One of the staff says \"Are there 8 pepperoni on it?\" I say no there are more than 8. They say then it's extra pepperoni because the regular only comes with 8. ARE YOU SERIOUS???? A complete waste of my $2. What a scam!! As I waited, I saw other pizzas go by loaded with toppings, but they skimp on the pepperonis? I checked Yelp and it looks like I had the same amount of pepperoni as in every other picture. So either everyone only orders extra pepperoni or they are super cheap & I was robbed $2 worth of pepperoni!! I'm going with the latter. I checked in with my Yelp app and saw the offer a Free Small Gelato so I claimed that and chose the Vanilla flavor. Now how did everything taste? Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No complaints. I loved everything about everything. Really the only thing that kept them from getting 5 stars was their pepperoni scam. Save your $2, it's not worth it.",

For starters, it's not a traditional pizzeria in any sense. You walk up and order from a menu above. Everything is hand-crafted and fresh-made; no slices of pizza that have been sitting there for hours waiting to be reheated. Additionally, all pies are individual sized; there's no family-sized pies here.   Not to worry, the pizzas are simply phenomenal. As they're baked via a wood-fired grill and not a gas oven, they have a crispy crust that gives it a far greater flavor. Of course, it helps that there are some imaginative combinations on the menu. The pesto pizza with bell peppers is quite spectacular, and the broccoli rabe with sausage is sublime. You can't go wrong with their grilled pizza.  There are other options if you're not jonesing for pizza. There are plenty of delicious toasted sandwiches and salads to choose from. Also, an excellent beer and wine selection to boot.  I've started frequenting this joint about once a week, and haven't been disappointed so far. It's my hope that TRUE catches on, because it's a welcome respite from all the chain pizza take-outs around town.",

    "text": "Love True Craft but after multiple visits I do have a couple of thoughts. It would be nice to have a couple more choices from the sandwich menu.  Maybe something not so heavy like turkey or chicken salad for lunch and a little wider variety for salads.   Additionally, the water seems to have an \"off\" taste. I did mention this to them during the last visit.  I believe they use the water from the tap.  I'm native to Charlotte  and let's just say I do not drink the water from my faucet.  Investing in a filtration system or offering a bottled water in the interim would be a great option!  Hope my thoughts are well received and are constructive!!  :)",

At the time, there was 1 table with about 3 people and 1 other person at the bar. That's it. We proceeded to watch about 8-10 employees in the corner of the restaurant all counting their tips at 8pm on a Saturday night. None of them even looked up as we stared at them for about 3-4 minutes. At this point, we had enough and left. Only the greeter and bar patron noticed us leaving. Employees were still too busy talking amongst themselves and counting money. We went next door to Smoke Modern Barbecue where the food is not as good, but service was excellent, even though it was packed full of people. This was a truly disappointing experience.",

The old one was just ok, so I didn't have high expectations for TRUE.  TRUE blew away my expectations.  Not only do they offer WHOLE pizzas delivered quick at fantastic prices, but they're delicious and offer unique topping combinations.    We ordered the Broccoli Rabe & Sausage and Prosciutto di Parma pizzas.  Both were unique and delicious, although I preferred the former because it was hotter and the arugula kept falling off the latter.    Everyone was super friendly, and the atmosphere is very modern.

In fact, it's more frustration in myself, that I can't eat everything on a menu in one sitting. And that the restaurant offers so many tempting dishes that I can afford. That is how my first experience at TRUE went.  The model is order-at-the-counter, they'll bring it to you (a-la McAlisters or something like that), so it's a casual environment with lots of families there. I will say that because the restaurant kind of revolves around their kitchen, it's pretty toasty in there, but it wasn't terrible.   I had never seen grilled pizza before, and neither had The Lady, so we both ordered one. I got the Prosciutto Di Parmi and she ordered the House-made pesto pies. These. Were so. good.  Crispy flatbread, fresh ingredients, and really unique pizzas will keep me coming back. I can't wait to try the other pies, and maybe a few other items too. Keep doing what you're doing!",

You order at the counter upon entering the restaurant and entrees are delivered piping hot to your table. The centerpiece is a huge stone oven which is surrounded by simple, well laid out seating.  In addition to the standard pizza choices, I have also tried their unique items such as the Bacon, Egg and Cheese pizza which is loaded with bacon and thinly sliced potatoes with a fried egg in its middle. The hot Chicken Parm and Meatball subs are also very good.  It is under the same ownership as Nothing But Noodles, so you can bet it is well managed, has great service, consistently high sanitary scores and receives my \"Gotta try\" rating!",

The margherita had a bit too much sauce and was soggy in spots by the time I got it home, but I'd rather that than a dry piece of cardboard. Everyone at home liked the pepperoni and the sausage and peppers.   Staff was friendly and helpful. I thought I ordered an arugula salad and didn't realize until later that it didn't get entered into the system but when I got home and called about it they offered to buy me one next time I was in. That's classy.   The dining area and bar are nice enough that I would consider eating in next time. There's a small patio too.   Finally, I would suggest calling your order in ahead of time if picking up to go bc I ordered there and waited quite a while. Everything made to order, from what I could tell. Worth the wait for fresh. Looking forward to trying the salad. It looks really good from pics.",

I didn't realize it was an \"order at the counter\" place, and we were a little confused about how everything worked at first. (Am I dumb?) We stood in line for about 10 minutes, and that gave us time to debate where to sit - do we sit at the bar? If we do, do you order there, too? If not, can one of us grab a seat before we order, or is that rude? (Ok, I'm dumb.) When I got to the register, the cashier explained that we ordered everything there, and if we decided we wanted another drink, we had to go the bar and pay for it separately. Kind of annoying, but okay.  We got the meatballs to start, which were huge and meaty and saucy and delicious, and we split a pepperoni pizza. It was tasty (isn't all pizza, really?) - a little on the thinner side with more cheese than sauce, and gooey cheese at that, and a smidge greasy, but that just added to the flavor. The fella got a NoDa Hop Drop 'N Roll, and I settled for a soda. All of that was about $30.  Service was on point with a few different people checking on us, getting us napkins, refilling my drink, etc., so it was definitely good... I just felt like they weren't quite sure what they were going for - neighborhood take out pizza joint (which a ton of people were doing) or nice, sit down Italian restaurant with a bar.  By the time we left, the line was wrapped around the restaurant, and I felt like a salmon swimming upstream just to get out!",

This is one of those places where you walk up to the counter and order. They bring your food out to your table when it's ready. Overwhelmed by the menu (not that it's massive or anything... just a lot of solid looking items), the guy at the counter walked me through options. Traditional, specialty oven baked, grilled. I went with his suggestion of the garlic & clams oven baked pie. Clams, pancetta, roasted garlic oil, parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. Delicious combo... although probably not the best for the breath. No vampire stands a chance after this. I had to stop myself from eating the entire thing in one sitting.   The bar area is really nice. TRUE has a lot of local beers on tap. I went with Root Beer. Hey, it was 11am... someone has to be an adult. Workers were all super friendly. Prices are fair. Gluten free options are also available.   I don't venture out to the Ballantyne a whole lot... that parking lot known as 485 frightens me... but I will be coming back here again during my next adventure out this way. There are a few more pies I must try... plus I didn't save room for any gelato today. Such a rookie mistake. I will be back.",

True is pretty good pizza.  it's artisan style so you're not going to get a slice like from the window in Brooklyn but all in all it's purdy good.  Sweetie and I split the pesto pizza which had great flavor.  Nice pesto flavor, grilled onions and peppers on top with some dusted parm.  I would have liked to see it cooked a bit more since it was a little limp / soggy if you know what I mean. The kids had plain cheese which must have been good since we only had one piece left.  The pies are 10 - 11\" and very reasonably priced.  The service needs a bit of improvement from what I saw yesterday.  It's an order at the counter, they give you a number and bring the food deal.  The kids they have working there are pretty inattentive and are focused on just doing one thing.  I had 4 plates for 5 people delivered and gobs of straw wrappers on the table.  Kid walks by and I ask for another plate and if she could take the straw wrappers, she walks away without the wrappers and brings me back like 6 plates(now I have too many) and never takes the wrappers.  Her job was to bring plates....no other thought involved, throw your own shit out.  Anyhoo.....True Pizza is a solid choice for artisan type pizza at a good price.",

    "text": "We went to True Pizza on Saturday evening, and they were packed!  It was smaller and more cramped than I thought it would be.  The line to order did not move until tables came open, definitely a different way to handle things, but it worked out so that people just coming in can't snatch tables.  We started out with the risotto fritters.  They were good - breading with gooey cheese, served with tomato sauce.  As there were three of us, we decided to get two pizzas, but we could have easily just had 1.  We went with both styles of pizza - grilled pepperoni and the oven baked broccoli rabe/sausage pizza.  I liked the oven baked better, but the grilled was good (fantastic a day later).  My complaint about the grilled is that the outside pieces on the edges were burned - had no sauce or toppings.  I really love the flavor of their pizza - the sauce, cheese, toppings - it is wonderfully done.  My biggest complaint which is why they lost the star, is that the oven baked pizza came out 10-15 minutes before the grilled.  They classify these as individual pizzas, so what if I got one and someone else got another, I would be waiting and watching the other person eat, or vice versa. Luckily we were sharing and enjoying both, but they should time the two styles better so we can enjoy it all together.  We ended the night with Apple pie gelato, it was delicious as well!",

The Prusciutto di Parma was simply incredible; mounds of arugula, prosciutto crudo, shaved parmesan and a drizzle of balsamic fig glaze. The BLT pizza is pretty dang tasty choice too! A small salad was enough to feed four people! I loved that they put radishes, shaved carrots and peeled, diced cucumber in the house salad. The Ranch is homemade and delicious! Great staff, great food, great beer! Throw in a free scoop of gelato for your Yelp check in and you can't go wrong!!",

    "text": "The Prosciutto di Parma is my absolute favorite - light but fragrant. The house-made pesto is also amazing if you like pesto, but can get a bit greasy. Get the Grilled Zucchini, Eggplant & Mushrooms if you love zucchini, eggplant, and mushrooms - they were VERY generous with the toppings (esp. the mushrooms like wow I'm so used to getting like 2 mushrooms per slice).  One thing I've noticed about the grilled pizzas is that they tend to have slightly burnt edges and bottoms - not a huge issue if you like crispy crust but can get annoying sometimes when you have to peel the burn areas off. For their specialty pizzas, the sausage and peppers and mushrooms and onions are both good choices (again, always generous on the toppings so you feel like you get your money's worth). The Bacon and Egg is drier and has less cheese than the others. The hot oil pizza is actually very hot like very hot like my mouth was burning an hour after leaving the restaurant hot.   Basically, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.",

BUT, if I had to choose... it'd be tough.  -The bacon & egg was awesome, especially if you're into 'different'/non-traditional pizzas. -The garlic & clams also had an awesome taste, although I felt the clams were skimped a tad on the piece I had. Also good for you non-traditionalists.   The BLT, House-Made Pesto and Sausage & Peppers pizza all tie in my book for my first choices. You really can't go wrong with any of them.   buon cibo!",

So, pick up was what we were all looking for.  Everyone wanted to do the traditional pizza, however, I just got my Sur La Table magazine with all of the great looking specialty grilled pizzas.  So, I wanted one that had arugula and prosciutto.  True Craft Pizza had something for everyone  - we ordered a Grilled Prosciutto de Parma, 4 Cheese White Pizza, Traditional Cheese and a Traditional Cheese with pineapple and ham.  Each one of us got what we wanted.  Pizza was really every good.  Since we did pick-up, I think the crust would have been crispier if it hadn't gone in the box. The 11\" pizza was a good size.  We had two small slices left and I'm sure  they will get eaten for lunch or late night snack.  I don't like paying $44 for pizza, however we all really enjoyed the pizza and I usually pay $37 for two large pizzas (cheese and white) and then end up throwing out half of one of them.  So, this was worth it and I'm sure we will adventure inside at one point, but I'm still a fan of the take out  - I will just probably suggest going there and ordering the pizza versus ordering from home and picking it up (less time in the box).",

    "text": "Our family just got back from two weeks in Italy so when someone said this was the best pizza in Charlotte we thought, OK, show us. Well they did. This is the best pizza in Charlotte, rivals the ones we had in Capri two weeks ago. The crust is just the slightest bit chewy, not all the options are slathered in tomato sauce.  Some trendy for the foodies, bacon and egg, clams and garlic; some traditional for the non adventuresome, pepperoni. Appetizers are great. They should serve the meatballs as a main course. Service is prompt and courteous in a private schoolboy summer job kind of way. My only criticism is the ordering system. You order and pay as you go in like fast food. If you want another glass of wine or something then you have a whole additional credit card event. We didn't have the great looking gelato as it would have meant a third credit card event. There were a couple of post graduate preppy guys walking around that looked like they owned the place so I am sure they will put their MBAs to work and sort this debacle out. The food overcomes this, just order a bottle of wine or two glasses when you go in until they figure it out.  What matters, the food and the service are outstanding! Oh and did I forget to tell you? It's trendy, its cool, hip and fun.....and reasonable. The check came and I was so pleasantly surprised. When was the last time you took a family of four with two large teenage boy appetites out to a trendy place, had great wine and the check was WAY LESS than $100. Absolutely the new go to place in South Charlotte.",

Not fun. We liked the pizza but not the after effects. Either someone didn't have very clean hands or the sausage was off. Sadly this our first time and I don't think we'll be back.   Also, there's no hostess or anything that tells you what to do. You order at the front and then sit wherever you want but there's no sort of direction.",

It's covered with vegetables and as a vegetarian that is very important to me. Most pizza places give you barely any toppings and I always end up paying more to get double the toppings but not at TRUE! My husband and 16 month old love the meatballs. They also offer a daily special pizza which is fun... My husband usually gets whatever the special is that day since they usually have meat on them I don't eat them but he has always been happy with it.  The take out person has always been nice and friendly! Great pizzas!!!",

    "text": "When True Crafted Pizza opened in Stonecrest my initial reaction was \"great, another pizza restaurant\" - it feels like there's one on every corner, how could this one possibly be different. But I WAS WRONG! As soon as we walked into True Crafted Pizza we could see the difference - it's nothing like the pizza place that used to be there. It's clean, bright and very inviting. The menu is easy to understand and the staff were fantastic. We went for a late lunch/early dinner and we were starving, so we split a caesar salad for 2 and it was wonderful! Great portion size and the dressing and croutons were fantastic. We also got the mozzarella wedges, and they were light and delicious. I ordered the four cheese pizza and my husband got the bacon and egg pizza. He said it was the best and most unique pizza he's ever eaten and my four cheese was equally awesome. We will definitely go back to True Crafted Pizza!!",

That said, I walked and it was slammed; very busy place.  Indoor and outdoor seating, very attractive. However, as soon as I walked in I noticed a smell that was off putting. I'm not sure if it was the doe or a old mop. Either way, it wasn't cool. I was able to make it past the smell, not a huge deal but odd.   My largest complaint once I noticed was some of the employees where just hanging out. I shouldn't really care but some folks where busting their butts. Hey to some people out but what looked to be the assistant manager of sorts because he wasn't in the same shirt as everyone else.  He was just bs'n with other employees to the point I noticed. If I were running this place, he would just have the day off or a extended absence, zero contribution.   All in all, this place is ok for me. That said it won't be a priority for me to come back. Maybe take out...",

I usually create my own with lots of olives, peppers, pepperoni and mozzarella cheese...yes! That is why it's my own combination! Get appetizers to start and gelato to top you off! Nice, modern decor, fast service, fresh tasty pizza everytime. I've never been disappointed and I have brought my husband, and he has brought his friends whenever he is in town to eat here. Always a good option for anyone to consider!",

The staff was great about asking the line about party size and finding seats.   Between the 5 of us and with 2 hungry teens we got 4 pizzas. I had the white pizza and it was refreshing and not as heavy as your usual. The sausage and broccoli Rabe was also great.

The flavor was bland for the calamari but the sauces made up for it. Would I get this again? Probably not because to me it's not worth $10.   We for the grilled pizza with marinara sauce and pepperoni and mushrooms. Pepperoni had a good spice to it and the mushrooms were delicious. Pizza was good and fresh but gets soggy really quickly.   I checked in Yelp and got a free scoop of gelato. When I showed it to the girl she told me she didn't know how to do that and asked someone for help. I had to go up to the front and get a refill on my soda.   I will say they work really hard at this restaurant. No one was standing around and they were all working or cleaning.

    "text": "KEEP in MIND I am honest and I don't like to only write when it's BAD so please read how I started as a 4 star, went to a 3 star and how I ended up at 2 stars now.  I would give TrueCraft a True 4 stars as I've been a customer for about 4 years now HOWEVER since I am just getting to my review I have to take off 2 stars due to 1) An event I had which took them to a 3 star and now 2) the guy on staff ( maybe a manager) on my last visit who did something very unethical and unprofessional without knowing the situation. Let me paint the picture: Friday Feb. 24, 2017 It's a Beautiful sunny day in Charlotte so I take my son for pizza for lunch after some shopping for toys before my datenight evening set with my husband. We order him the kids pizza and he and I the Spinach salad to share. As I was paying I checked in on Yelp and there is a check -in offer for gelato. The nice young man reviewed my phone and said \"would you like it now\" and I said no I need my son to eat and then we will have it. As he was leaving he told the other guy at the register that I get a gelato this guy was spanish at the register now and very nice. After we ate I walked up to the register and mentioned the gelato and the guy asked which one which I allowed my son to choose and he put it in a cup with a spoon for my son and we went to head to sit back on the patio to enjoy the weather and the gelato together. THIS is where IT GETS unprofessional: There was another guy who I believe is a manager, taking the order of a lady and her family HOWEVER watching my son and I our the corner of his eye and our transactions with the Spanish guy. As we headed to the door IN the MIDST of him taking this lady and her family order he yells to the SPanish guy \" STOP HER she didn't PAY\" I mean REALLY a freaking scoop of gelato caused that much theatrical actions???  The Spanish guy went to explain to him that I have a Yelp Check-In offer and I turned politely and asked if he would like to see it or if he would like me to give him the $2 for the gelato so he could focus on his customer and not me with a toddler and a scoop of gelato. I mean come on, its a Yelp offer so if I didn't pay YOU OFFER IT for FREE for Yelpers...  IN THE PAST: I would've given them 4 stars as I said because 1) I discovered this place through a movie night Yelp event in 2013 and afterwards I ended up having Big Red come park in our home driveway and I had a BackYard movie night with Big Red providing all the pizza, salad, appetizers and gelato you can eat for my friend and family. It was a great night for the most part as everyone loved the food. My only issue was the fact that they didn't realize a family member approaching and decided to talk rudly about my guest late arrival and say things like \"We are LEAVING when we are set to LEAVE regardless if her guest are here or not\". I mean as a business you shouldn't have to say those things out loud as I am paying and if I have a contract for a certain timeframe, I'm professional so I know how to abide by my contract so that goes unsaid. Or it could've been discussed with me and not amongst the staff and management in a disgruntle way in public where neighbors and all could hear. If I would've wrote my review after my event it would've been updated to a 3 stars..",

Last time we ate here my wife got \"glutened\" She got really sick. We contacted management and the owner was kind enough to get in touch with us and said our next meal was on him.   Now it's been almost a year since we've dined here. We sat down today for lunch And a couple of hours after lunch she is doubled over in pain, or sitting on the toilet. The pizza was the only meal she had today. So there was no doubt it was the pizza that got her sick. So I must sadly say, we will no longer be eating at True crafted pizza",

My dad ordered the sausage and peppers pizza, and noted that he likes the tomato sauce because it's simple and lets the ingredients shine and meld together.  Highly recommend for a casual meal or take out!  The service was also great - everyone was so friendly!",

And we heard this place has the best - according to my other older and wiser co-worker!  We went to check out their menu (online) and we saw they had a margheruta pizza. Well a grilled cheese and soup is not enough for two people, right? So we ordered the pizza as well!! When the food arrived - she picked it up - it was delicious! The grilled cheese was HUGE! Way more filling than I thought. Half of their grilled cheese and soup was MORE than enough. It was ooy-gooy deliciousness. If you do not like that much cheese, DO NOT order this meal. The soup was creamy and yummy as well. After eating the grilled cheese, I was stuffed. But I still forced myself to eat a slice of the pizza. It look fresh and tasted great! I waited a little too long to eat it because it was a little cold but it definitely was my fault. I could not get enough of their grilled cheese!!   I will definitely be back. Who know a pizza place would have such good grilled cheese?!?",

Certainly the best dough/crust I have had since moving to NC. We preferred the traditional perpetration over the grilled style. Our favorite is the traditional cheese pizza. We also tried the sausage and rapini pizza as well as the grilled pepperoni. Next time we are going with the Margarita Pizza. We also tried the house salad, which is enough for 2. It comes tossed with oil and vinegar and Italian seasoning. We also tried the risotto balls which are excellent. This concept will do very well in Stonecrest.",

The reviews lauding the grilled pizzas as the way to go are correct, in my view.  The traditional varieties are fine, but not special in any way.  Our party had both the grilled pepperoni and the grilled prosciuto di parma ... both were EXCELLENT.  My wife got the baby spinich/arugla salad, and added chicken.  She is generally pretty finicky about wilty lettuce, so when True's passed muster that should be seen as a strong stamp of approval.  For a 'modified table service' approach (order at the front, then the staff brings your order and refills -- very similar to Brooklyn Pizza), the service level was good.  The staff was upbeat and engaging.  We enjoyed the very open layout.  The classic films playing on the big screen were a fun touch.  We will be back....",

You walk in, place your order at a counter, then go sit down.  The place is large enough inside to sit and not feel crowded.  A large tree table provides a spot for a large group (12+).    We ordered a Cheese and Pepperoni pizza with an order of fried mozzarella.  The service was pretty good - ordering was the only place where it could be improved.  Once we were seated we were waited on pretty well considering it was a counter ordering model.  The fried mozzarella came out promptly so we could eat it before the pizza came.  It was OK - nothing spectacular, but not bad.  The pizzas came out - they were moderately sized, thin crust that is not crispy, but not soggy either.  Sauce is well balanced - not heavy or too sweet.  Plenty of cheese and pepperoni, and overall a pretty good pie.  A little pricey per square inch of pizza, but not crazy - much better than Inizios for the price point.  They need some better beer prices for sure though!",

Today we ordered to go and, like last time we ordered the grilled pesto pizza is so horribly over salted I couldn't eat it. My Greek salad had more soggy lettuce in it then fresh and the tomatoes were completely over ripe. At one point, their regular cheese pizza was delicious but lately there's very little sauce on it. True has definitely lost its edge because their grilled pizzas used to be grilled perfectly and now it's just burnt. I hope they recover and go back to how they had been when they first opened. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be giving them any more chances.",

I travel extensively and have been to a fair share of pizza parlors.  This place is a solid 4 stars. The dough and toppings are super fresh. The crust is chewy as it should be (000 flour) and cooked nicely.   Some reviewers complain about prices but in reality the pricing is appropriate for the quality (get Dominos if all you care about is price). I deducted 1 star for two reasons, service was good and staff was friendly and helpful but they seemed a bit undertrained. In addition one of the pizza guys had a beard with no hair net, this does not freak me out, but technically that is a no-no.",

Prices are really high.  You pay $11 for a traditional 11-inch cheese pie and toppings run $1 for most veggies and $2 for meats.  Some toppings are higher.  But the pizza is good.  Pies are 11\" and 7\".  The toppings are really skimpy.  Even with fresh sliced mushrooms, there were about 7 on the 11-inch pie.  Their sausage, pork with fennel, is excellent, but don't count on a lot of in on top...similar to mushrooms. Meat balls were excellent and you got about 8 halves on a pie.  Basil, barely one leaf per slice.  But the pizza is good.  Eat in or take out.  Their suggested combinations, to me, were odd, which drove wife and I to order the create your own.  The facility is immaculate, they have a full bar and a nice large long table for those soccer teams.  Staff is very pleasant and is there is not a line will coach you through the process.  We will try it again, but for now it is A-OK.  I would not rush back, but is worth another try.  Give it a try and tell us what  you think.",

    "text": "I have been here 3 times so far and have never had a bad pizza. All of their pizzas are are 11' which allow you to order multiple types and share. To date, I have tried the bacon and egg, pepperoni, sausage and pepper ( my favorite one so far), grilled zucchini, mushroom and eggplant pizza which also had yellow squash on it (my least favorite  but a good vegetarian option- would probably add meat to this if I ordered it again) and  broccoli rabe and sausage pizzas( my second fav). But there are many more I want to try and you can also create your own pizza. The salads are good sized and made to be shared. Love the crispy risotto fritters appetizer! They also serve a variety of beers- some of them locally brewed, and wines. And their gelato is nice way to end the meal.  The last time I went there was with a large group. The staff was very  polite and accommodating, continually checking in with us. This is my new pizza place in Ballantyne after having many disappointing meals at a chain pizza restaurant in the same area. Would highly recommend it!",

The pizzas are the size that you order your own, my wife usually leaves one or two slices where I can eat the whole thing. The only downside to this place is that you order at the counter, they give you a number and then the fun of finding a place to sit begins. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night it gets a little difficult to find a table. So far we have been able to find a table before our pizza comes out each time, but it's just kind of a pain in the butt. Other than the table issue if you haven't been here I would say give it a try- it's really good!",

    "text": "3.5 stars: better than OK, short of excellent  The food We ordered two pizzas, but one would have been enough.  The onion and mushroom; very good crust and the baker wasn't afraid to \"toast\" it dark (but short of burrned) well done! The onions and mushrooms flavors were fragrant - none of that crap canned slice 'shrooms so many cheap joints rely on - the onions held a bit too much water as it's often the case. Still I'd order it again. Prosciutto on flat bread:  man, they are generous with the cured ham considering it retails for $16-22/lb, a little skimpy on the provolone though. Tasty and the baker smartly avoided the common pitfall of drying out the thin sliced prosciutto.  So quite good. Possibly the menu could be expanded, I didn't get the impression there that many options.  Service. No menu until you get to the cashier to order at the cashier which I HATE. Luckily there was no one behind us. After that they bend over to please, 4 different people stopped at our table to find out if we needed anything else, if we wanted more water etc. Nice but it makes no sense to me, if you're going to have a full staff why not order at the table?  Decor: Lovely, clean, fresh, loved the white on white, the thick marble tops, the reversed back metal chairs, the lamps etc but space planning is a FAIL. The combination of a store-wide hall as you enter and the totally oversized pizza prep station  centered in the room totally chops up the space. No it's not \"small\" inside, it's actually a nice space but the architect butchered it. Customers are left with 3 small areas to dine in. Eight cramped tables at one end, 6 booths at the opposite end and joining both area a long communal table but again the space it too narrow for it - the bench was pushed out of the way so people could walk by.    If I was the owner I'd admit mistakes were made (possibly strangle the architect) and make some changes to the layout ... and that is constructive criticism for a store that zeroed on a good formula and should be in business for a long time.",

There's ample seating in and outside of the restaurant (covered and on the large sidewalk). We sat by the pizza station so the kids could watch pizzas being made. We ordered the classic cheese pizza for the kids, a white pizza for the two of us and a Caesar salad. They brought us our drinks and food, and throughout our meal multiple staff stopped by to check on us.  The pizzas were delicious and I would say 1 pizza and a salad could easily be shared by two people. The kids loved the pizza but it's definitely a firmer/chewier crust that required a lot of effort for my little one to bite off pieces. My only suggestion would be to use less dressing or have it on the side because the salad was pretty drenched in it.  We would return!",

We got two pizzas, two salads and two fountain drinks for over $40 and the portions were on the larger side.

    "text": "I lived in New York City from 1998 through 2007 so I've been exposed to excellent pizza. Pizza and bagels are two of the foods I have missed most since moving to Charlotte. They just don't make them down here like they do up there. Recently I went to True Crafted Pizza for the first time after reading an article about it in the Observer. I had low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised.   I ordered the grilled margarita pizza with caramelized onions. The crust was perfectly done: thin, flavorful with a nice texture - not crispy (except maybe on the very ends) but not too doughy. It was baked enough to be on the verge of burned, but not over the edge. The mozzarella cheese was creamy and delicious. The sauce seemed to be very basic with chunks of whole tomato. The pizza had a nice saltiness to the overall flavor, but not too much. It was truly the best pie I've had since moving here. Absolutely the most similar to NY style.   My boyfriend opted for the baked pie which had a bit of a thicker crust and was round (mine was rectangular). And his crust was also delicious - chewy, nice flavor and texture. It's too bad there isn't a True Crafted Pizza anywhere near Uptown as Ballantyne is a hike for me. All I can hope is that they flourish and decide to open another branch.   I will say, the ordering system could use some tweaks. You order at the counter and they bring you the food, which is fine except that you can't see the menu until you are right up at the cash register - talk about pressure. Being that it was our first visit we wanted to peruse the menu for a few more minutes before being pushed into a quick decision. We tried to let the people in line behind us go ahead of us but we told we could not do that since they had already assigned us a table number (or something along those lines? We were slightly unclear of the reasoning.) So we had to order very fast, but luckily our quick decisions turned out to be delicious anyway. Also the tables do feel a little bit cramped inside. Space layout could probably have been improved a bit although the atmosphere is very nice.   Nice beer selection as well. The salads looked good - we did not order one - but nice looking produce from afar!   5 stars for food, 4 stars for ordering system/space layout  We will definitely be back when we are up for another \"road trip\" down South! Now, if only I could find my Charlotte bagel shop...",

Risotto Balls oozing with fontina cheese, salads ice cold & crisp thin crust pizza that I have not had since last years trip to Italy. It only takes one bite to recognize quality ingredients. Service was spot on throughout and we especially enjoyed the very comfortable bar seating. Their beer selection is great as is their selection of Italian wines. The whole place was imaculate, not a easy task given that it was Saturday night & the Peanuts movie had just opened at the multiplex. Just wish that they'd carry a decent imported non-alcoholic beer:(",

TRUE Pizza is a wonderful, family-friendly pizza place we'll be coming to again and again!",

Food came out fairly quickly and service was moderate to good. The reason for the 2 star rating would be the AC in this restaurant was AWFUL. It was so hot to the point it was unbearable for us. Servers looked as though they were working hard, but were all sweating a lot. The AC must've been broken but if that's how it is all the time I won't be returning, or will only be ordering takeout only.",

I like the bar space they put in - makes the place look much nicer than it did before.   However, it is still a \"fast casual\" concept where you walk up to the counter, place your order and pay.  We weren't sure what to get, but decided we should try one of the grilled pizzas.    I wasn't thrilled with any of the grilled options listed on the board, so we decided to build our own... we chose a grilled pizza with tomato sauce, basil, spinach, chicken, black olives, and mozzarella cheese.  We didn't order any appetizers or salads, but after we got our pizza, we realized that we should have.  The pizza was good, but not overly large.  It would have been the perfect amount to share if we had started with a soup or salad.",

I always get the pepperoni pizza and chocolate gelato ice cream.  The ingredients are fresh, they make their dough right in front of you and cook it in a wood fired pizza oven.  The crust is my favorite part of pizza and theirs is perfect!    Their food is worth the 45 minute drive...but I hope they expand to Huntersville or Cornelius soon.",

Its flavors are fresh, simple, and of palatable quality - from the rustic hearty crust to the homemade chunky tomato sauce and all the wonderful toppings.    As far as catering goes, True Crafted Pizza is a show stopper.  They roll in a fire engine red retro truck and unveil a beautiful kitchen with a live roaring brick oven.  You can pair your meal with salad and some fresh gelato too.  Hire them to cater your next outdoor event and your friends will still be talking about it days later.",

It basically reminds me of a Pizza Hut Personal Pan pizza I used to get when I was a kid like a million years ago only this actually tastes REALLY GOOD. My favorite combo is pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno. I also LOVE LOVE LOVE their vegetable chicken SALAD. I always get it without chicken. If you love real whole vegetables like, asparagus, squash, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and bell peppers you'll like it. It's served cold with a creamy dressing and some type of pesto as well. The veggies are grilled to perfection every time. If you are a VEGETARIAN, I highly recommend it. It is so filling. I think I could live off it. If they ever stop serving it I will ban this place from my life. The service and ambiance hasn't left an impression on me either way. It's fine.
