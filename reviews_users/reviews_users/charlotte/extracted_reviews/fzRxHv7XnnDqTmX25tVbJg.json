Also, I liked the infinite number of tvs that they had.  Enjoyed the flautas that we ordered as well.  Only thing is that the brews are overpriced considering its beer.  Probably wouldn't come here for drinks, I'd rather probably just grab a few drinks from Georges Brasserie next door and have dinner there.  Troy, a server, was awesome.  I left my keys there and he came out to return my keys.  Pretty cool considering I was meandering about Piedmont Town Center for a few minutes.",

    "text": "I took some out of town guests to Taco Mac this past weekend for a cheaper bite to eat.  You can find some great dinner choices here at super-reasonable prices.  They were doubly impressed by the extensive (and sometimes overwhelming) beer menu.  I sometimes think I'd like to try various ones, but with over 100 choices, I really wouldn't know which ones to pick, so I stick to a handful of usuals.    I ordered the boneless chicken wings with sweet potato fries ($1 upcharge from regular fries but worth it because the meal itself is only $7; I tell myself I'm being healthy).  I ordered the Three Mile Island sauce because I love me some spicy chicken!  Unfortunately, they're *always* pretty stingy with their sauce (that's why I have to take away one of their stars).   I can tell because the chicken pieces are barely dipped in the sauce with a lot of obviously bare, uncoated spaces.  C'mon, now.  If you're going to dip them, really dip them!  I'm afraid to ask for more when the server brings them because a lot of places will charge you $1 extra for a side of sauce!  I don't want *extra* sauce; I just want what should originally be on there.  The bites should be totally coated in sauce, not randomly spotted.     Shame on Taco Mac for their sauce-stinginess, but yum to everything else.",

    "text": "Hey Mac, I do not understand the crowd here... at least after my experience.  I guess it could be the numerous beers to select from or maybe the numerous flat panel TVs.  To me, it was just \"meh\".  Atmosphere - Chain restaurant on steroids, been there done that-ish,  large, more TVs than Best Buy, tiered, noisy, crowded, they do have tacos...not sure about mac & cheese.   Food - I should have gone with the same dish (Los Cabos Fish Tacos) as my friend as he thought the tacos were decent.  Me, I had the Buffalo & Blue Cheese Chicken Sandwich w/ a side of fries.  You think this would be a safe dish for any place.  Unfortunately, the bun tasted of a generic grocery store variety, the chicken was present, and the sauce...the sauce tasted like spicy spaghetti sauce on chicken...it was awful.  To top it off, the fries were over seasoned to the point that I could only eat a few.  Normally, I eat any fry provided.  Due to the seasoning, I left more than half on the plate.  Service - The girl who waited on us was nice but very busy.  The manager did stop over and ask how the meal was, but it was more of a going through the motions than really asking as I clearly gave a \"meh\" and a bad face with the inquiry.  All I got in return was an \"all right,\" then he walked way.  Maybe my reaction was received as positive...I do not know.   Overall - With a big \"meh\", I doubt I will be going back anytime soon...mac.",

Our server was as nice as could be and got all of the drinks correct. The kitchen, not so much. The appetizer brought to our table was not what we ordered, but was taken care of in a timely manner. Then our wings and burger came out to the table. The wings were great but 3 bites into my burger and it was actually raw. As in, I feared that I was going to be violently ill just by the few bites that I did have. Though they did bring out a fantastic donut desert because it was my birthday, I was very disappointed in the kitchen's execution.  I really did appreciate the manager coming over and apologizing, but this is definitely a birthday I would love to relive... at a different restaurant :-/",

During the week, it's still busy, but not insane like the weekend.   Checked it out again for dinner this week, even though my past visits were deafening! We sat at the bar and the friendly bartender took care of us right away and brought us the massive beer list - I think there were 150 on draft! Oh my! We found out they give away Pint Glasses on Thurs night if you order certain beers, so I got the Sweetwater to get my free pint glass to take home!   They have a big menu - sandwiches, burgers, wings and of course apps. We decided to split wings and they were really good! Hot sauce was just hot enough. My only gripe is they don't give you celery with wings, you have to order a side of celery for $0.65. I've never been anywhere that didn't include some celery with wings, I don't like that they nickle and dime like that. But, the wings were good so I'm over it.  We also decided to join their beer club - you get a card, get points, get free stuff. I'm already drinking beer, so I might as well get a free tshirt out of the deal!   Check it out some time you're thirsty for a good selection of beers!",

You will not be blown away by anything but for the price, you should be. The do have the largest selection of draft beers I have ever seen. I usually have one maybe two beers in a sitting so I don't drink a lot. But I love a good craft beer and Taco Mac always has something new for me to try.

I'm willing to pay a premium for some hard-to-find beers, but $6+ for a bottle?  This isn't NYC/DC/LA, give me a break!   Their wings are terrible.  The boneless wings were little, over-cooked turds of dried-out chicken that appeared to be sitting under a heat lamp for hours - tough as leather too.  Their roasted wings were chewy and disappointing, but not nearly as barf-eriffic as the nachos.  Any sports bar with a beer menu like this needs to kill it on the wings if they're going to get some street cred, this place makes Pizza Hut's wings look like Gordon Ramsay creations.  The atmosphere and facilities are okay, I will give them that.  Tons of TVs with sports in every corner and the bar area is large with plenty of high-top tables and seating options for your happy hour crowd.  The biggest issue I have with the place is its lack of identity.  If you want to be a neighborhood sports bar and grill, be that - but don't over charge and stuff it full of pretention and expect me to sing your praises.  In a nut shell, this place is a much more expensive version of Wild Wings Cafe or Buffalo Wild Wings with a greater beer selection and crappier food.",

The Southpark location is a bit different than the UNCC location probably due to the fact that the UNCC location took over a steakhouse while Southpark took over something else (I can't remember for the life of me what was here before TacoMac).  Anyways... parking can be a pain.  If the area is busy, and for the most part it is busy all the time, the deck can be a nightmare trying to find parking without 1) ramming into a concrete wall and 2) ramming into someone that is trying not to ram into a concrete wall.  Once you survive parking, there's a pretty big waiting area in the front of this TacoMac.  For good reason too.  The first time visiting, we had to wait about 45min (standing)... but the beer and wings were worth it [I keep telling myself].  There's a nice outdoor patio area - but I have not had the pleasure of enjoying a meal out there yet.  It's actually quite funny that the two times I have gone here, the hostess seated us at the exact same booth both times.... I can understand that happening occasionally, but this place is quite big with lots of tables.  There looks to be an upstairs at this location... don't know if it is reserved for private parties or if it's just another overflow area, but I will investigate some more!  Overall - this place gets a solid 4... the waiters do a good job and seem pretty knowledgeable about the beers on tap (or usually find someone that does know the answers).",

The surprise was the chicken wings. I just took a chance. Not the original one but the crispy ones. I tried those with a medium buffalo sauce (on the side). The chicken wings are absolutely delicious. For dessert I ordered the cheesecake. It was just about medium okay. I have had better cheesecake. I would skip it next time and given how close the cheesecake factory is to this place, I would go there for my dessert fix.",

Mind you this was at 9:30 on a Wednesday with no major sporting events scheduled, so it was not full in the least. I would say it was another 5 minutes before we were greeted by the waitress (wiping her nose with her hand as she did so).   I ordered Wings and my girlfriend chicken tenders which took a solid 30 minutes to arrive. After the food was dropped off, we waited another 20 minutes or so to have our drinks refilled (which were empty at the time the food arrived). After pointing out to her how long we waited for service, she laughed and said she got on a cleaning spree. I'm glad paying customers rank lower than wiping a table off. At this time we also pointed out to the waitress the hair that was found in the food, to which she replied \"oh s***,\" and then asked if we wanted the rest of the food the hair was in before she took it away.  No apology was given, and we tried to find a manager, but we quickly discovered that the lack of attentiveness was not limited to our waitress.   Our entire meal took about 1 1/2 hours (no apps, no beers, just 10 Wings and some chicken tenders with hair in them). We will not be going back.  Update: I emailed them in response to their comment to this post four hours ago and it seems their customer service is as prompt as their wait staff.",

    "text": "T Mac...meh. This place is nothing to call home about. It's a bar, it has bar food. The food is ok for the price. Some of the chicken is gristly but  sometimes that's the luck of the draw. They have a ton of beers but the beer menu isn't easy to read. The service is bad. Like BAD bad. Every single time! I have been to T Mac for dinners and the service was awful, I have been for happy hour and the service was awful, and I used to work down the street so I would go for lunch somewhat often and sit at the bar, and that was the only time the service was decent (hence the 3 stars). The dinner service is SO super slow. The restaurant would not be busy either. It's like they just forget about you, every single time. Southpark has a nice reputation but T Mac is not one to visit. The type of service it has should warrant cheap drinks and that is just not the case. I'll never be back if I can help it!",

    "text": "I love Taco Macs.  When it popped up under nearby bars in Untappd I knew where I was going for dinner...should have checked the Yelp reviews because not all Taco Macs are created equal.    For a Monday night with football on, they weren't that busy, probably not even 35% capacity.  I sat at the end of the bar as several people had tipped up chairs to save for their friends, a big faux pas for me as bar seating should be first come first served, yet half the seats available seemed to be reserved.    Anyway, I set down and waited 15 minutes before anyone even talked to me.  I had looked up most of the beers under the categories \"stout\" and \"ipa\" in untappd.  It went downhill from here.  To my neighbors surprise, who had ordered wings 10 minutes before me, my hamburger came out first.  In fact, our bartender said he completely forgot about his wings.  I had received my beer and water, but no silverware or napkins.  Asking for some when he set down my plate along with ketchup.  10 minutes later he returned with ketchup and I once again asked for napkins...it's hard to eat a dripping burger with a beard without napkins.  Once again he returned with ketchup and I asked yet again.  Then when I was almost done with my burger he asked if I needed anything and I said, \"I need some freakin napkins, I had to borrow one from my neighbor!\"    So service completely sucks.    As far as the beers go..yeah, they have a big selection but quantity does not mean quality.  There weren't any nitro beers aside from Left Hand (the bud light of nitro) and the barrel aged beers weren't highlighted.  On top of that, I completely missed a large group of beers on the front of the menu under the local section..I incorrectly assumed that they would all be on the giant beer list on the back.    Long story short...the Taco Macs I visit in Peachtree City is one of the best beer bars I've ever visited.  This one...horrible all the way around.  Bad service, bad food, bad selection, they even let the smokers stand with the door open to stay warm letting smoke blow into the restaurant.  I won't be back.",

The reason I knocked off a couple of stars was because you have to drink 13 different beers to get in and most people will never get to see it. When I go with friends, I can't take them to the suite with me and it's a bummer because the fried chickpeas and the different beer menu are so worth the visit.",

Sat at open table in bar......well, 15 mins later someone finally stopped by to clean it and speak to us. By that time, already had grabbed a beer from bar. Ordered an appetizer, got it 15 mins later - good thing they comped it as I would've hated to pay the 9 bucks for what turned out to be a small plate of burned cheese dip. Decided to try the wings based on their recommendation - big mistake.  Simply, quite nasty, borderline undercooked, rubbery and tasteless. All in all, a complete waste of time going there. Outside of the amazing beer selection, this establishment offers nothing. Don't waste your time.",

We were greeted semi-quickly - I'd say five minutes or so and our server promptly took our drink order. It took quite a while for us to get our drinks but I will admit that I think our server had been double, maybe triple sat... so he may have gotten a little bit in the weeds.  We put in our order when he dropped off our drinks and still had not received food FIFTY minutes later. No apology from our server until we asked for the check since we had to be back at a meeting at 1PM. The manager never came by to try to remedy the situation either.  We paid in cash, and our server said he would check one last time to see if our food was in the window. Five minutes later, nothing. He had to give us our money back and we left starved.  Apparently they were super busy inside... somewhere... although I only saw one table in there but whatever. Maybe there was a 50 top upstairs hiding that I was unaware of.  Anyway, server was nice but not very apologetic. We went back to the meeting without lunch and were put in a pretty sour mood. We will not be returning any time soon.",

Our server heather had the worst attitude I've seen in a server. Not to mention she disappeared for about an hour and a half during our visit. We waited 10+ min for our first beers, asked for menus and eventually had to go hunt them down ourselves, didn't have silverware when our food arrived, and just had a generally unpleasant experience. When we asked for our checks, we waited TWENTY FIVE MINUTES, only to receive one check instead of split up and our waitress was clearly annoyed that we could ask such a thing. We spilled a drink and had to search for our own towels to clean up. We interacted with what seemed to be every other server on staff and they were perfectly pleasant. On the other hand, our server was constantly rolling her eyes and sighing with an annoyed attitude. If it had been busy, maybe the service would have been acceptable, but the attitude from our server was enough to keep us from ever coming back. As a server myself, I understand being busy and not being able to pay the best attention to your guests, but there is never an excuse for a rude attitude.",

The place has an awesome amount of NICE TVs, one from almost every vantage point. Seriously, I think they have more TVs on display than Best Buy. If this place didn't have such nice TVs, I would have probably given it a 3 based upon everything else.   If you like Duke, steer clear, every time I have been it is Carolina turf.  They have every beer known to man, and this comes at a price. There isn't a cheap beer on the menu. Coors Light was the cheapest at $3. Most I saw were in the $5-$8 range. We usually order pitchers to keep costs down.  Mixed reviews on the food. I had their chicken sandwich with the avocado on it one time, and it is the best thing I have had on the menu. Don't get the fish and chips or chicken tenders, I have had friends order those and say they sucked. The fajitas were good  Location is nice, located in the roundabout in Piedmont Town Center, the area has an European flare with outdoor seating and condos above the shops. The building is spacious, and offers 2 levels of seating.  As for the staff, I have no real gripes other than when the place gets packed. I came for a Carolina/Duke game one time with standing room only, and was wedged near the section of the bar where the drinks go out to the servers. I began watching the staff more than the game, it was utter insanity behind the bar, no True leader and everyone pissed at each other. Reminiscent of Lord of the Flies.",

For that reason, I'll withhold judgment on the food.  As for the beer and atmosphere, I'm ready to relive some memories.  Good food, they say, helps you relive a memory.  So does sticky floors and the smell of left over beer.  When I walked into Taco Mac, I could swear I discovered a long lost fraternity brother who followed his franchisee dream.  I wish there was a Taco Mac at Penn State when I was there.  With a beer selection second to none and tables with taps built into them, this is a college sports bar that has been misplaced.",

My only gripe about Taco Mac: Charlotte is its location.  Parking can be tough, but it's nothing that would keep me from visiting again.  The 4 Atlanta Taco Macs that I've been to all had more of a bar feel to them.  Charlotte's location is quite spacious and has a somewhat fancier interior.  There is also a second level.  Our waitress was great and had a pretty good handle on her beer knowledge.  If she didn't know the answer to something she'd get an answer from someone who did know.  The beer selection is definitely great.    If The Liberty and Duckworth's weren't closer to my house than Taco Mac, I might visit more often.",

He took 10 minutes to come back and take drink order.  At which point I walked my son to the bar to get him some water.  The waiter took another 10 minutes to bring drink order.  Husband ordered steak WITHOUT blue cheese and sure, enough, it came with blue cheese.  The rest of us finished our dinner and his food still had not come.  I wanted to love this place - was a major original Taco Mac fan during my college days from 1979-1982 and was looking forward to introducing my family to my 'old hangout'.  Love the humongous beer selection.  On a positive note, the Death wings were definitely HOT.  I have a hot-food eater in my family and we try wings everywhere and they are never hot enough - saw tears in his eyes for the first time.  Manager comp'd our meal after he heard about our bad service AND gave us a gift card.  I guess I will come back with my son and leave my husband at home.  He will never return.",

But then there's the ugly side of Taco Mac... the ridiculous method that the servers have to follow, which gives the customer a terrible and frustrating experience.   First off--you don't have a \"waiter.' You have a group of people that all do only 1 job: you have your friendly order taker; then there's the person that delivers your beers; then there's the person that delivers your food;  then there's the person that delivers condiments after you've waiting on your ranch or blue cheese and your wings are getting cold or by now your mouth is on fire...; then there is the person that takes your empty glasses off the table... you get where I'm going with this. They have to put everything through the computer. I've been to the CLT location 4 times and have had a horrible service experience EVERY TIME. The wait staff is friendly but the system just isn't working. You're either waiting on your beer, food, or condiments you ordered 10 minutes ago or suddenly you have 4 beers and 4 orders due to the service inefficiency and lack of proper communication.  Great place to watch the big game, just come with patience or make sure you sit at a self-service tap table or you WILL be waiting on your beer.",

Also- if you order pizza and/or wings in Buffalo you will receive not only Celery (a given) but Carrots as well.   I wanted so badly to have real Buffalo sauce on my wings but Taco Mac did not deliver. The Hot sauce was mild to medium ( I am wimpy when it comes to sauce too so keep that in mind) I definitely needed more heat. I also was asked whether I wanted fries OR celery? Since when did wings come with french fries? Does anyone really not want celery with their wings- that's craziness!   I did enjoy the ranch dressing- kind of unique and had chives in it- a little gourmet touch. Also, the prices were pretty reasonable $6.99 for a half pound of boneless wings.   The place itself is a bit overwhelming unless you're a television addict. I felt like every inch of wall space was covered by a tv - who needed ...you know...conversation. I wasn't a huge fan, I suppose if you want to watch every single game going on in the 50 states at the same time, this is your place. The place lacked personality-where are the pictures of old-time downtown Buffalo??- Or at least a Miller Jersey.....  The beer selection looked awesome- Ive never seen personal beer taps at your table (cool!). The service was excellent. Our server was so friendly -and very accommodating.   I probably would have given 2.5 stars but I was so disappointed by their False claim! Just because you have Beef on kimmelweck  and name your menu items after Elmwood Ave and Kenmore doesn't mean you know how to deliver Buffalo food to the South.   Cue end of rant.",

Don't bring someone here expecting him/her to focus on your conversation.    Another big plus was they were eagerly willing to allow beer samples so you didn't get stuck with a new beer that didn't agree with your beer buds.   We sat at one of the tap tables and initially it was kind of a huge disappointment, but they fixed it to get the beer flowing as it should. They also have a beer club like the Flying Saucer, however there is no charge to join this one. i forget the perks, but if i lived closer it'd be pretty cool.   They do have a mini game room tucked in the back and yes they do have Big Buck Safari if that is a necessity like it was for us this past weekend.",

Yes, they are internationally known for having over 145+ beers on tap. Some very cool things, you can join their university and get a PHD in beer. Why wasn't this offered back when I was in college!? Kids today have it made. I have had many types of wings over the years and think TM has the best of them all. I highly recommend to get them swimming which means they come \"swimming\" in sauce. It is a $.50 charge but worth every drop.   This is by far the largest TM of them all. What a way to make a splash in Charlotte and in South Park no less. I sat at the bar to catch some of the games. So my service was pretty fantastic. I had about four bar keeps waiting on me. I was impressed that they carded everyone which is a great habit.   On this visit, I went with the Wings (Hot/Swimming) and fries with a pint of Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale. I was definitely feeling the arrival of fall with college football on the telly and pumpkin ale in the belly.   If you have beer, sports and wings on your mind then I would say give Taco Mac a try!",

He then mentioned that they were out of Purple Haze glasses so we would not be getting a glass....ok?!?!?!  He then went on to tell us that they had a mug club and something about getting our names on a plaque outside the door if we drank a gazillion beers and asked if we would like to sign up.  We politely declined and said we would sign up next time!  I don't know how many beers this place has on tap but I know there has to be at least 120 taps on the wall, probably more.  I also don't know how many TVs are in there but they are everywhere.  From where I was sitting I think I counted about 45 of them but I know there are more than that.

While very large both were very dry and stringy. Very hard to bite and eat as a sandwich. Coleslaw tasted very old. And that was it's only taste. Shrimp tacos were a hit. Nachos not so much.

    "text": "First and foremost this place is a SOLID 3.5 stars. ANNNNNNDDDD Beer fans, this is the place to be. They have over 250 beers to choose from and over half of those on tap! 5 stars in my book. Also, the selection of food was fantastic.   Not being familiar with the area, it was a little difficult to find as the sign is not as large as other surrounding businesses. We parked and decided to walk as we knew we were close and sure enough we passed right by it. Love the outdoor sitting area too.   Upon entering, it reminded me of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. They have a large bar area with a ton of large screen TVs for any sport enthusiast, booths line the perimeter with a few in the middle with several inner tables,both with low and high seating. Oh, they have upstairs seating as well. Great place for large groups or family. They do have bar tap tables that contain three taps of your choice, for purchase of course; however, call ahead to see if they are available. They were not available the day we went.  Food selections were impressive from flat breads, to salads, wings (pick your sauce), wraps, burgers and, of course, tacos. Staff were friendly and appeared to work well with each other. Orean, our bartender was great and for not being a total craft beer snob like me, he knew his stuff. We ordered take out - mexican sweet corn, slaw and apple & goat cheese flat bread. Orean suggested we double up on the side items as they are small. We ordered two corns and glad we did because he was right, palm size at best. The flat bread tasted awesome and loved the unique combo of apple and goat cheese, however, I was rather disappointed in the size of it as well.   When asked why the restaurant had less than exemplary reviews, Orean suggested it may be due to the location and type of establishment. However, reading many of the more recent reviews, most mentioned bad service. Well, the service we received was top notch. Although the food tastes great, the portions could be larger considering the prices you are paying.   Yes, it is a sports bar in a part of town that is known to be higher caliber or as we say in Hawaii high makamaka; Yet it's classy, well laid out, and very clean.",

The part that has been the greatest is the attention that they give to my two babies.  As a single father, I often come in to eat at night and get a break because they give so much attention to my babies and it makes me feel good to see the treatment that they get.  Senait sometimes even holds my babies and plays with them and I am able to eat in peace.  I've come here with groups before as well, and she is always very attentive to the needs of those at my table.  I plan to come here for the years to come because of the good treatment that we get.  There are restaurants everywhere and many of them have really good food, but no one has given so much attention to my babies before which is one of the reasons that I have come back so often.",

Another couple came in after us and within three minutes a server (also our server ) came over and took their drink orders. I guess the server realized that she had another table and came over and got our drink order. Fast forward to the arrival of our food most of the order came out, but when asked about our flat bread the server said she forgot to put it in and asked \"do you still want it\". We told her yes and she went and had it put in. She was all over the place the entire time not waiting for us to ask her questions or anything. We will never come to this location again. Eating out is expensive you should be able to enjoy yourself and not feel like you wasted your money.",

Every time I find myself in this Taco Mac, the service is abysmal.  It usually takes flagging them down to get someone to serve you.  Not sure why this is, I'm guess it's just improper training or laziness on the part of the local management team.  Otherwise, Taco Mac has a great selection of beer and a good looking menu to order from, along with TV's to keep up on all the games.

She seemed uninterested in that request and apparently just sat us wherever she felt like. So after getting a TV switched, we were able to see the game we wanted. The food was ok... Let's just say I won't go back for the food, but after a few drinks it might look appetizing. Again, the beer selection and the number of TVs is this places saving grace in my opinion.",

It is a menu of mostly junk using what appear to be the cheapest available ingredients.  I know it's about the beer, guys, but I've eaten the food a few times here (including last night) since they've opened a couple of years ago, and I've always been astounded how bad it is.  At least at other places, the junk food tastes good.  This doesn't.  Come on, guys, it wouldn't take much to change this.",

I've never tried the food but the beer selection is obviously good (150 beers. Yum!). The wait staff could use a little more training - like making eye contact with customers or delivering drinks a little more quickly (I realize that's not always in the hands of the servers.) Overall its a decent place. It's not going to be the first place I pick, but I'll definitely be back!",

However, dont rely on the staff to tell you about the beers if your not familiar with them, most of them dont know much about the beer list. We know a good amount of beer so it doesnt matter to us. The food is pretty good bar food, but nothing to special. The food prices are pretty right on and much cheaper then what you would expect for a grande restaurant like that in South Park. If you go on the weekends for the games they are very good about putting atleast one tv on with the game you want as long as one has not been requested already. They do have beer tap tables where you can pore three different beers on your own. The only draw back is if you do the brewniversity then those beers dont count toward your points. Get there early on busy nights because it is first come first serve but typically the wait is less than 20 minutes for a table",

The server took 20 minutes to get to the table just to take our drink orders, Everyone ordered except me and just when I was about to order he walked away as if i was not even sitting there. The drinks took 10 minutes to come and I had to ask the waiter if i could order a drink because he started to walk away again. I ordered a Margarita once again it took forever to come However it was very stong so I thought I was getting my moneys worth UNTIL I saw there was a dead bug in my drink!! But after our waiter had dropped off my drink we didnt see him again, 30 minutes had gone by, and everyone else drink was empty and i still had my drink with the bug in it. We went to the host to see if we could get a different waiter, she told us no! Then found our waiter so we could order food but he ran away so fast i didnt get a chance to tell him about my drink. Finally a girl came to deliver our food and I told her that their was a bug in my drink and she only responded with \"okay?\" She didnt even act concerned! she just got me another Margarita which I didnt want by then.   Needless to say that I will never be back to this place. They had a wide selections of drinks but then you have to worry about bugs in them, They food was okay nothing great. and the service was TERRIBLE! Dont waste your time and money on this place,",

Then the server messed up our order and blamed us.  Finally, she asked us to pay our tab so she could leave.  On my second visit I suspect our server was also trying to leave because as soon as we were done eating he asked us how we wanted our check split up.  Never mind the fact that no one asked for the check and we were going to stay and have a couple more beers.  We were all so annoyed we nixed the beers and left.",

    "text": "I went to Taco Mac to watch the Alabama vs Penn St football game and to try it out since it is new.  The game was on Saturday night and the place was packed, but I managed to steal a stool at the bar.  I started of with a Guinness, the nectar of the gods, and ordered some chicken wings, heat level hot, with fries.  I asked the bartender for a side of the death sauce just to see how hot it was.  The wings came out pretty quickly, but my side of death sauce was missing.  The wings were pretty good.  The bartender checked and saw that I didn't have my side of death sauce, so he went to check on it.  I finished my Guinness and asked the bartender for a recommendation of another stout.  He recommended the Jailhouse Stout which was a special.  Guinness is the nectar of the gods, but Jailhouse Stout is what they drink when they run out of Guinness.  Smooth and creamy with a hint of coffee.  It made an excellent counter point to the rest of my wings, now with the side of death sauce (which to me was hot but no where near death).  I finished my wings and was looking for a palate cleanser something light.  Unfortunately they were out of Pilsner Urquell, but the bartender had another recommendation which turned out to be very good.  I can't remember the name of it, but it was a wheat pilsner that was great.  I would probably go back to Taco Mac, but not on a busy Saturday night.  The food was OK, they have a massive number of TV's and the bartender was very knowledgeable about the beers he was serving.",

    "text": "Think an overly franchised, corporate version of Fly Saucer.  The good.  140 beers on tap and 200 plus by bottle.  Waiter knew his beers and could make recommendations.  High-tops in the bar area with your vary own taps (2 regulars and 1 seasonal).  Plenty of TVs in a 2 story space so there's not a bad seat in the house for the game.  Foods reasonably priced, most of it was under $10.  The bad.  Burger I had was required to be cooked medium well.  There could be some surprises but I would imagine the rest of the menu is similarly mediocre (the food prices seemed to indicate the quality).  Beer prices weren't great but weren't exorbitant.  Service was acceptable.  Neither impressing nor disappointing.  Shame that its in South Park.  I think it could have a cool neighborhood character if it was in a different part of town (I'm thinking Duckworth's).  Conclusion.  I'd go back for the beer selection and to watch a game.  The taps at the high-tops would make for a fun night with a group of friends (first come first serve unfortunately, no reservation so it's a shot in the dark).  I'd try the wings on the second trip but if they flopped I would probably try and eat before hand.  I'd go again but not necessarily put it on the regular rotation.",

First thing I wanted was a cold beer after all that had gone on that evening... It took forever to get the attention of one of the three bartenders. Now don't get me wrong I know my way around a bar, but this was ridiculous.  It was literally 30 mins. to get a beer.  If I had not been there with a wedding party I would have left.  So my next thought was to order 2 beers to avoid the 30 min fiasco.  Nope! They needed the ID of the person the second beer was for, so I showed him my ID again.  They would not sell me two beers at once. I was there with all people that were over age and I was 27 at the time, it was not like I was sneaking them out the back to underage kids in the parking lot.  I have never had bar service that bad, and I have been in a lot of bars....  The food service was no better,  I would not go back here if I was paid to. Stay Away!!",

I had to wait 10 minutes before she and came over. I ordered a water, which took 5 minutes to get to me! These times are not being exaggerated by the way. My server finally came over to get my food order after another 7 minutes. The food came out fairly fast, but my server was still nowhere to be found. She finally showed up to ask me about my nachos once I was half way done. She disappeared again and didn't return until I was finished. She immediately returned with the check as if I was totally done. Before I could put my card in the book, she came by to inquire about my payment 2 times! That was the most I had seen her consecutively since I got there. Where was this urgency during my meal? NON-EXISTENT!!!! THIS WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND I WILL NOT COME BACK!",

    "text": "Two stars because the food was good. From start to end, every interaction we had was very poor customer service. We asked the hostess for a table or booth anywhere that could accommodate a high hair. She brought us to a high booth and told us it wouldn't work for a high chair, and asked if we wanted a booster. We have a tiny 1 year old so we told her anything else would work, and had to reiterate. The whole building was empty, and every seat type was available so that was odd. Then our server Ali came 15 minutes after we were seated for drinks. We decided to order everything at once, not knowing when we'd see her again. Our drinks took another 10 minutes. The food we had was great but our kids meal was never ordered, so after we got our meals our kids had to wait for theirs to be made. Our drinks were empty most of the meal and we had to go hunting for silverware. Overall, wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "So it's Thursday night and there are some GREAT college football games on TV (2 sets of top ten teams playing) and you want to go have some dinner and drinks and watch the games.  Taco Mac should be a great choice.  It is a big sports bar/restaurant with like hundred tvs.  Well, think again....  We had a dozen tvs right around us.  We pleaded with the waitress for an hour to get one of them changed to the big college football game.  She kept telling us that the managers were all really busy.  Now, I understand that the restaurant was busy for evening.  They were on a wait and the place was packed.  But I guarantee you half of those people there were coming in to see the college football games on TV!  It is just crazy to me that they only had the big games showing on a handful of TVs in the place.  Not to mention we never got a tv near us changed as requested - and we were there for 3 hours.  Never.  Besides that, the hostess was rude to me after I requested to move to a booth that opened up near us, telling me that there were people on the wait.  She offered no other solution, just basically told me no.     I have been to this Taco Mac dozens of times.  Unless you get wings, the food is just okay.   I tried the new flatbread \"pizza\" which was basically a semi-crispy flour tortilla with some tomato and cheese.  Umm, no.  And I typically like the queso poblano, but when it was delivered to us this time is was cold and hard.   We were so hungry we ate it anyways.    In conclusion, I keep going back to Taco Mac because it is a convenient sports bar in SouthPark.  But the truth is it just isn't that good.    At least our waitress was nice.",

    "text": "The place is not called \"Taco Mac\" anymore. It's now \"T-Mac.\" Although they seem to serve the same amount of tacos as before.  Also, one server doesn't have long hair anymore. He cut it. Looks like a different guy, lost his edge.  T-Mac has great televisions. It is the most spacious sports bar around, and they check the IDs of *everyone.* No exaggeration.  Beer flows like wine in this place. There are at least 170,000 taps.  T-Mac seems to understand that people enjoy feeling like they are a part of something bigger than themselves. With this in mind, all patrons over 21 years of age are welcome to \"enroll\" in their \"Brewniversity.\"   Upon enrolling, you have to be a pledge first. Pledgeship ends after you drink 10 different beers. *NOTE - It is not necessary to do this in one sitting.* You also get a grey t-shirt signifying your new status. After this, you are just like the rest of the worthless souls in the place, free to spend a few hundred dollars in order to get another worthless memento.  Last week, all draft beers were 35 cents. Full pints of draft beer for 35 cents. No limit. Granted, on the nicest day of 2014, their patio wasn't ready. No chairs or tables. Baffling. We stood in the sun, drinking 35 cent beers, which was great.  The new lunch special is underrated. $6.95 for a full color page of options in large fonts. Wraps, burgers, quesadillas, burritos, or the Monterrey Chicken Salad plus a side for $6.95. That's GREAT. You can get T-Mac Chili or Chicken Tortilla soup or fries (maybe vegetables, too?) as a side. The T-Mac Chili heated my tortured psyche on a dank day.  Some people don't like the food here. I tell you, I have enjoyed everything I've tried. Granted, the Shrimp and Avocado Salad was preceded by much hype and it didn't meet expectations. I blame the expectations, because I have been pleased by everything from their tacos to their hostesses.  They have an upstairs room available for events - fantasy football drafts & scrap-booking outings.   I'll leave T-Mac with this: A sports bar of this size with a full menu should have bigger bathrooms with more stalls and urinals.",

The food is average (at best), the service has declined, they are usually out of a few of the beers printed on their DAILY menus, and their corporate office isn't doing anything about it. As a frequent customer, I reached out to the corporate contact message board the other day and all they really offered was \"I'm sorry\" and \"which location were you at?\". Not that I was planning on going back, but they definitely didn't offer any solution/motivation to return.",

I had the grilled shrimp tacos, a little small but overall good flavor. It was the service that was lacking. We started at the bar and once everyone arrived we moved to a bartop table. Well, that really through them for a loop. After almost 15 minutes we finally got someone to stop and take our order. One of the guys I was with tried to order beer 3 different times. They were out of all 3 beers he ordered. I know that's not the staffs fault but it just seemed we were destined to get bad service that day. Will I be back? Probably, but just more wary.",

I really appreciated that. We did not wait long to order and the food came out fast as well. I appreciate a restaurant that prepares in advance for their private groups. You can tell they had extra staff on hand in the kitchen because the food came out as if it was a party of 4. I do recommend this place for group events if you want to do something because it was easy to get and upstairs so away from the main crowd. Request for Jordan to be your waiter! He did his job well. Food was excellent as well for a wing spot and prices were good. The wings are not amazing but they are good.",

    "text": "I've been to other Taco Mac's but this is the worst of worst!  The place was not even a quarter full. Took 20 minutes to get a beer at my table. I was told the kitchen was behind but 20 minutes for a beer??  I spoke with Zeke the manager who apologized and got our beers out about 4 minutes later and the wings a couple of minutes later. He gave us 4 napkins for 5 people who are splitting 50 wings!  What??!?!  Then I asked our waitress for more napkins which never appeared. I went to the bar and got some after 10 minutes.  Then I had to find waitress for the check. I asked if the manager was around and he was no where to be found. They gave us 25% off.  So let's recap:  25 minutes for beer, 30 for wings, 4 napkins, 5 waitress appearances, 2 turtle doves and a lousy manager who doesn't care about his customers.   Please stay away!  After I left several locals told me it was horrible. If you need to see multiple tvs it's great. But that's it!!",

When we asked about those tables, they said there's no way we could sit there. They never changed one of the big TVs to our game- instead they switched a tiny side TV to our game and we had to crane our necks to watch the whole time we were there... which was a LONG TIME. We waited almost 50 minutes to get our drinks ONCE we were seated! Eventually a group of about 15 people came in and sat near us. Their drinks and food were both delivered before our first drinks came. Honestly the worst service and most unorganized restaurant we have ever been to. Save your time and money and DON'T GO HERE!",

Ordered chips and queso. It never came. Food came quickly. Street tacos are filed with greasy meat that is so over salted you can hardly eat it. Onion rings are very good. Looked around several times and there was not one single server in the entire dining room. For over 5 minutes. Dirty tables. Dirty bar and the bar tender was walking back and forth behind the bar without cleaning up. Weird experience overall. Probably won't return. To many negatives.",

I walked up to the bar saw some of the hugest, clearest, big screen hi-def TVs everywhere and the middle seat of the oversized bar was open.    On the main screen they had my beloved Yankees scoring 8 runs in the 3rd inning over Detroit, another tv had Broncos playing the Texans, and another tv had men's  USA basketball......I had to sit down.  I wanted to try something new so I ordered the rotisserie  wings with the new cracked pepper cayman flavor.  If you like spicy then this is the flavor for you - it has a great taste with a spicy kick.  I was not proud of this moment when my nose started running but the wings were so good that I didn't even bother to pick my napkin up to wipe my nose until all of my wings were finished (I have provided my before and after pics of my food).  It was not a good screen but I didn't care who was looking.  On another note, this place is know for their great selection of beers on tap......and I ordered a sweet tea - lame!!!  I definitely will have to come back every time I am in town.",

The service is typically average and they're usually really rigid about the games they've got on. Taco Mac was nothing like that.  We got there and were immediately greeted and taken to our private room- where the service was perfect. The waitress was attentive without being overbearing and provided a great experience for all the guests.   I got to try a lot of appetizers and main courses and everything was good - the menu is varied enough you can eat something healthy, much on some flat breads or enjoy some of the amazing dips. They've got a great beer selection and a bunch of high tops with taps built in.   If you're looking for a place for a private party or to watch a game this place is great.",

One time we went and we waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table. We ended up handing our menus back after the 15 minutes to go somewhere else due to a time constraint.   The wait staff are all friends and pay no attention to the patrons. There can be 3 other tables at the restaurant and you will still have extremely slow service. You will also find the staff smoking on your way out after your meal.   Honestly the beer selection is good, but it's really not worth a trip here. It's also priced higher than other sports bar in the area. We come here because it's the only sports bar walking distance from our place. Moving soon though and won't be back to TMac ever again.",

In South Park, the service is a weak three stars, but I typically sit at the bar where the service is better and the bartenders will always entertain a conversation.

After being seated, it was 6-8 minutes before we were acknowledged. Our server 'Owen' took our drink order and a minute or two later another person (manager?) dropped off free Queso to our table for the wait, which was great because we ordered it anyways.  15-20 minutes following that we finally received our drinks (no apologies for the delay, mind you).  20 minutes later we had not yet received our food (wings and tacos, nothing extravagant).  I asked our server if we could get our check because we were running short on time and he just replied 'ok'...no apologies, no question as to why. He dropped off our check and left.  So we paid (including our 'free' Queso) and left.  Something has changed at this location and we won't be returning.",

Good stuff, complimented the sandwich well.  Service was good.  If you're a beer snob like me and already know what kind of stuff you like, you won't be overwhelmed by the beer menu.  I go dark and high ABV so it's easy to choose.  It's not terribly expensive either, if you know what you're getting.  The quality of beer here is top notch.  I recommend it to everyone without reservation...that is, to beer guys and chicks.  If you want a \"nicey nicey\" restaurant feel, then go to one.  If you want a cool beer place with good grub and tons of sports on TV (I like that they have skateboarding to watch!) then this is it.   It's a guy's place for sure, or a place for a really cool woman.  Princesses that suffer from restaurant snobery need not darken the door.",

We have still yet to try any of their food, but we are members of the Brewniversity where we can drink our way to free merchandise like t-shirts, mugs, and free beer.  I enjoy the layout of this place.  The space is huge and clean and there are special tables in the bar area with beer taps so you can pour your own drafts.  The idea of pouring the drafts is pretty cool but it doesn't work out so well when you have to work kinks out of the taps.  We tried the tap thing once and we kept getting full glasses of pure foam because the tap wasn't adjusted properly.  In the end the waitress worked things out for us and we ended up with a couple free glasses of beer, but it probably wasn't worth all the trouble.  There are tons of tvs so this is a great place to catch a game and work on your Brewniversity credits.  Plus they have a small arcarde room in the back of the restaurant that the hubs and I like to hit up.",

Referring to Taco Mac as Applebee's is just disrespectful.  Applebee's could not pull off a beer selection like this.  Taco Mac has the largest draft beer selection in Charlotte.  Not only is it awesome, it's awe-inspiring.  And, it's a mile from my house - +1 for me.    OK - It's a sports bar, not a bar.  If you want fine dining, go to Del Frisco's across the walkway.  It's a sports bar - they have unhealthy bar food.  And it's good.  They have 100,000 flat screens.  You can see any game you want.  This is your place to watch the Cricket Championship - they will have it not (Disclaimer - they probably will not have it on because we live in America. )  In closing - Taco Mac is awesome.  It's beer selection is unrivaled in Charlotte.  Stop hatin', start drinking.",

We came for the Carolina Panthers playoff game and sat at the bar.  The wings were excellent, the beer was cold, and the TVs were big ('Murica!).  On this particular day, that was just about perfect. Service was a bit of an issue.  Not because our servers were unattentive or rude, but because the layout of the bar doesn't lend itself to efficient service.  For example, the beer glasses are at the extreme ends of the bar.  If you are sitting in the middle of the bar (as we were), the server has to go at least 10 steps to get a glass.  In the bartending business, that is a mile.  Additionally, as in most restaurants, the bar is responsible for all carry out orders.  On big game days, this is almost a full time job for one of the bar tenders.  I would have liked to have seen an additional bartender to take care of the bar patrons or house orders.  This will be my Charlotte destination for beer and wings.  It should be yours, too.",

    "text": "If you're going here for wings, just don't. Worst \"buffalo\" sauce I've ever had, by far. I ordered the mild boneless wings, which were pretty much frozen breaded chicken bites with a little sauce on top- totally dry and boring.   The method in which they serve these is retarded. If you order mild wings, you get a wee little bit of sauce, but if you order hot wings, you get a LOT of the same sauce. It *should* be that if you order mild wings, you get the same amount of sauce as the hot wings, but a *different*, less spicy sauce. That's wings 101, man.   So because their crappy boneless wings were dry as a bone, I wanted extra sauce, so I asked for more \"buffalo\" sauce and ranch. They charged us $.75 each for those sauces. Come on.   Also, no beer specials? Really? Like... NONE. NEVER. They \"don't do beer specials\". Sorry, but if you're a beer and wings joint, to make a decision to never have beer specials is such an elitist attitude. People go out of their way to go out to eat during the week for specials and good food. Both of which, are not present at Taco Mac.   The manager even walked by and asked us how our food was. We were very honest with him about our experience, and he got really defensive about the food and never offered to fix the situation. It was also deafeningly loud.   The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 was because of 1) beer selection and 2) environment. They've got a massive list of beers, which is really nice (even though they're pretty pricey). They've also got mini taps all around the restaurant at select tables. So you can pour right into your own glass. Very smart. They've got big screens everywhere and it's quite clean.   So if you want pricey, rare beer and want to watch sports, it's all yours. You won't find me there, though.",

The setting is good, like a sports bar you may find in Boston or I guess Buffalo (in a nod to the owners) and from what I saw the beer and alcohol would fit any bill and with over 100 coke products on tap . . . you can't go wrong there.  But then there is  the general feel of the place.  Everyone that worked there looked bored, not enough people in the place during a late lunch to keep them busy and maybe a little too much time to go before happy hour starts.  The food was bland . . . even in the 5 star review below they say the food was just ok and he was being nice . . .   It's just a place that might be great during the games, but if there is not a game on . . . or you have no interest in the game . . . then you are in the wrong place.  I am sorry to all those people out there that love it, but it might be a good place to stop by after you have eaten . . . or if you just want to be by yourself and have everyone else leave you alone.",

I loved the a la carte tacos, and a some other dishes they just don't offer anymore.  They tried to \"class\" it up, and instead changed what we loved about it. The beer selection is great, but they do not have any specials (See Duckworths 3.50 nights).  Before the menu change, this was our go to over Duckworth's but, and I live in Ballantyne.  But now, I will just stay closer to home, with better food, deals, and the same great beer selection.  One thing hasn't changed though, the mediocre to sometimes downright horrible service.  This was always the worst part about his place, and before it was worth getting over. Now, not so much.",

Yeah, try sleeping on a weekend when there's a game on...the place was PACKED!   On the days I worked until 11:30 at night, I'd get some quick takeout from Taco Mac, which featured a full menu until 2am.  (At least that's how it was when we were there.)   The servers were super nice, and taught us this tip:  when ordering wings, get them with fries, and then a side of celery.  It'll be cheaper that way than ordering a side of fries.   The wings come in different spicy intensities, and I think are nicely crisp/tender. The fries are decadent and crispy with a slight seasoning. When I want a greasy, late night snack, Taco Mac is where it's at.   PS: for beer drinkers, the thousands of beer possibilities and the taps on some tables...very fun. (You can even get a print out of all the beers you've tried...it's like a collecting thing.)",

    "text": "The only way to describe Taco Mac (piedmont row) is hit or miss.  I've been there a BUNCH as it is right here in our neighborhood and I can tell you that the best thing, hands down about this wing place is... the beer.  Selection is great, price is what you would expect to pay for quality and the obvious over head of a place that large in SouthPark.   The wings and boneless wings are good, sometimes excellent, sometimes downright cold by the time they make it to your table.  Maybe that's because I'm only a pledge in their Brewniversity and therefore are not privy to warm wings like the brothers.  I'm not playing pledge-invaders tho.  I draw the line. Inside joke.  The best sauce is \"Hot.\"  The death is a very very peppery version of hot with some additional heat but I can tell you I never died, nor did I ever require a sip of milk, maybe it's spicy to some but I'm not impressed.  2nd best sauce is Habanero BBQ, although they must get mild habaneros as this sauce lacks heat as well.  Will I be back, certainly, it's close by, doesn't completely suck, and unlike most of the restaurants in southpark I don't need to take out a second mortgage to pay for a full meal for two.  I read another review on here which sucked. The person complained about a SPORTS BAR with TONS OF TVs being busy on game day.  You probably should have planned ahead.  Overall, I recommend you check it out.  Try a couple of beers you've never had before (I laugh aloud when I see people getting bud light bottles at this place, or friggin Mich Ultra.. are you kidding me?) and enjoy the patio on a nice afternoon.",

It took 29 minutes!!! to get the beer. I had already finished my appetizer, placed a dinner order, and received the dinner order before the beer came out. To add insult to injury the server kept coming over and saying the beer should be \"right up\". After the third time it became comical. I had taken an Uber over hoping to enjoy a few drinks. I didn't dare order another after how long it had taken. Someone at another table was also waiting really long for their drinks and their server blamed it on there being a party upstairs. That's hardly an excuse. I've been here 3 or 4 times but the service has steadily declined each visit. I'm afraid this visit may have been my last, which is a shame because they really do have an impressive beer list and a nice atmosphere.",

No joke, 40 minutes for a table of burgers and fries!!  I don't fault our server because obviously she doesn't cook the food.  However, she really could have acknowledged it better.  It almost seemed like she avoided our table for a while instead of just a quick apology to let us know the kitchen was backed up.  The food was pretty good.  I enjoyed my burger with sauteed mushrooms and onions.  I upgraded to the sweet potato fries but they were meh.  Prices were good though.  If it wasn't for the time constraint of an hour lunch break and the slow food, it would have been fine.  But I might come later next time to avoid the rush.",

We sat upstairs in an attempt to get away from the noise level.  1. The service was atroucious. Examples why:  a. The waitress knew NOTHING ABOUT BEER. If you are going to claim to be a great beer spot in Charlotte- then please hire some ppl who know about beer. The Flying Saucer has hot chicks in short skirts who know about beer. This is totally possible. WE asked for suggestions and she looked baffled. I asked for a Ranger and she said (and I quote) \"I have never heard of that\". WTF.  b. the bathroom did not have toilet paper in it. Gross. I told the server. She didn't really respond. I told another server. They all placed blame instead of correcting the obvious problem.  c. the food came out cold. We complained. They eventually heated it up. They never apologized. They never docked money off the check. We are talking COLD WINGS.  d. we must have had not the brightest waitress- but she seriously kept messing up our beer orders.  2. The food sucked and the menu is weak.   Hopefully- I will never go back.",

The menu is your typical T-Mac stuff. Lots of bar-food including wings of course. There are several taco choices and since it's in the name you'd expect them to be pretty good. I wouldn't tout them though. For the same price I'd rather do Cabo Fish Taco or Krazy Fish here in Charlotte.  They have a crap-load of beer options but beware of the attempts by the big beer companies to win your patronage through their far less worthy \"crafty\" options. The bar here is also, likewise, huge. It spans the length of one entire side of the restaurant. Prices are what you'd expect from similar restaurants like Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chili's, etc.  My last visit here was on a weekday night when there was no game going on. Naturally they were dead. Similarly, the staff was pretty useless for lack of a better word. Slow to check on us or come back after a wait to take our order. And slow on refills. Considering the price I don't plan to come back to pay what I could pay at a local restaurant for better quality and service. But all in all, I wouldn't call it a horrible experience. Just what you'd expect.",

Which, it IS a beer place, in all fairness, so I shouldn't judge based on that...but you have GOT to have good food with beer in my opinion.  The service is not bad.  The bartenders keep up with the flow pretty well.  The beer selection is vast and there is pretty much something for everyone.   I just wish they would change up the menu.  Small plates? More crafty foods? More thought and feel into the food vs bar food...blah blah.",

    "text": "So disappointed! The food was actually really good (we got a burger and tacos), but the service is TERRIBLE. There was almost no one in the restaurant when we got there, so it wasn't busy. The patio tables were dirty, our waitress had no idea what a flight of beer was , our order was messed up, it took ages to get a bottle of ketchup and napkins, and our bill was completely wrong (wrong items, overcharged for multiple dishes). Once the bill was fixed, our waitress never came back to pick it up! Looks like our experience was consistent with what others have experienced. A shame, since it could be a really fun place. With so many other great restaurants nearby, don't waste your time here!",

I would choose someplace else but it is so close to my office and there are not as many good options to watch sports and drink beer.   Six of us arrived at 4:00. We were told to seat ourselves.  After 10 minutes I asked if there was service in the bar area. Five minutes later we were brought menus.  We ordered beers.  We then ordered guac and chips. The food came a few minutes later. Still no beers. Finally beers arrived after 30 minutes of waiting. We were told there was only one bartender and one waitress. This was during March Madness. Poor planning.   The bill came and the \"March Madness\" pitcher special was not recognized on the bill. Waitress did adjust after I pointed this out to her.",

    "text": "Keep pounding...wings and beer? Yes, that's exactly what you do when you find yourself at T.Mac during the Super Bowl and the home team is losing.  I'm no Taco Mac novice so when my friend wanted to go somewhere with good wings for Super Bowl viewing, I had a pretty good idea that T.Mac would be a contender. We showed up on Sunday around 4:45 and it was already packed (shocking). She put our names down and we ended up waiting for only about 15 minutes and scored the last table of the night!   We got to enjoy the Super bowl on the upper level in a pretty deluxe booth for only the two of us. We immediately put our order in for beer, wings, and nachos. We went with the double order of wings (comes with 20 wings) and chose four different flavors: parmesan garlic, lemon pepper, honey chipotle, and honey BBQ. The wings also came with an order of fries.   The only gripe I have about the food is that I wish it all came out hotter and not lukewarm but I get that they were so busy sending out food so it was only a minor issue for me. The fries were very tasty! hot, crispy and had a slightly herby flavor. The nachos were also good, although I could tell the scoop of guacamole was made from a mix and not fresh (again, not a big deal just an observation!)  I really have to give it up to the entire waitstaff that night. Knowing that it was going to be packed, I didn't really expect much in the service department but T.Mac delightfully proved me wrong. We had multiple team members check in on us, offering to take away plates, refill drinks, etc. They were all incredible!  It was a very fun night getting to cheer on the Panthers and I highly recommend stopping into a Taco Mac location during a big game.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why anybody would not be a fan of TacoMac.  With 148 beers on tap and 105 bottle varieties, TacoMac is a treasure trove for craft beer fans.  I first learned about TacoMac right after I settled in Charlotte.  Unfortuantely, it took 5-months for me to finally try it out.  The thing is I had had ample opportunity to visit dozens of breweries so by the time I walked into TacoMac I knew what I wanted to drink: And, they had it.  Wow, cannot tell you how impressed I am with their selection. Moreover, they list out the style of beer, ABV, and prices for glasses and pitchers in a well laid out format.  5-Stars for beer selection.   Even if you're not a craft beer fan you'd like this place. They have an awesome atmosphere, with TVs, and large bar area, ample seating, and even private keg areas for groups.  Never saw anything like that before. Call ahead for availability.  The staff is a gem here. Orean was our bartender and he was great. He explained everything beautifully, gave us samples, and also offered up ideas for us to do in the area.  Well done.    I have not had a chance to try a lot of their food items, but they offer up a rich mix of tacos, soups, salads, burgers, wings, and flat breads.  I especially like their Side Items.  They have a Mexican Street Corn and House-Made Slaw that's to die for. We also got the Apple & Goat Cheese flat bread: I'm a fan.  I know a lot of the bad reviews I've read for this establishment were from casual Yelpers who complained about the service.  Let me tell you the service is not only great, it's 5-Stars.    I'm giving TacoMac a 5 for atmosphere, 5 for Service, 3 for Location, and 4 for food. They get a 2 for the price of their sides: very disappointing  considering I like to order ala carte sides.  5 for beer choices, but a 3 for prices: more than I generally like to pay.  TacoMac is a solid 3-Stars in my book. Great catch all place for craft beer fans and a classy, yet oddly priced establishment for a range of food preferences.",

It was OK--not great, but the food and service were good enough and the sports watching was good. Went back last weekend, because we wanted a casual supper with friends who live near there, and my husband wanted to watch the tennis match. We will not go back. The place was not that full (on a Friday night, should have been our first clue), but our young waitress (she was friendly, but...)took a very long time bringing our drink orders, then disappeared again saying she would be back to get our food orders. We were ready to go hunt for her when she finally did come back. She wrote our orders down in laborious detail, and did not seem familiar with the menu. OK, I get it; everybody has to start somewhere, but she came back to the table twice to ask for details about our food order; the only change from the menu anyone had asked for was to leave some avocado off one of the items.  Food finally arrived after a long wait, and it was only warm. My daughter enjoyed her cheeseburger, but the fries were limp and cold. My sandwich was supposed to have avocado, but I guess the kitchen somehow got the word to leave avocado off of everything, instead of just one order.  My husband had to ask three times for a drink refill. It finally came, just as we were leaving.  I'm glad we had a coupon. The meals were nowhere near worth full price.",

A lot from North Carolina and local beers which is always a big plus.  As far as a sports bar goes, it is decent.  Less than stellar is the service and food.  When you walk in from the decor, you expect the food to be a little better than that of a Wild Wings, or somewhere similar.  I feel like they are going for a more upscale sports bar, but they miss the mark.  It's just a bit confusing.  If this was a hole in the wall dive bar, I would not at all be criticizing the food (Because hey you get what you get).  When we first sat down the server who greeted us was not the server who took our drinks, which was not the server who brought our drinks.  When our actual server arrived he appeared a bit disheveled like he didn't expect to be sat.  He was friendly enough, but seemed aggravated we were just there to drink a beer and not eat.  If you're looking for a good beer and solid television selection you may enjoy this place.  If you're looking for any sort of decent meal for the price, maybe try something else.",

Not what you expect at a Sports Bar. And more importantly, and unfortunately, it was BLAND! This certainly was NOT Cotija cheese which is flavorful and salty, similar to parmesan. Was probably white American cheese. And the meat inside was chewy and bland. I do not associate Mexican food with Bland, but Taco Mac seemed to achieve this dubious honor.   My friends ordered Nachos for the table. Sure, there was lots of it, but about 90% chips. The beef was ultra fine and bland. Where's the heat? There were a few jalepeno's but they were dry! Must have been sitting out too long to lose flavor like that.  The boneless Buffalo wings were decent, but also lacked the punch I love with traditional Buffalo Wings.  The ONLY thing this place has going for it is the awesome Beer selection. If it didn't, I'd have given this 1 star. But they really do have a tremendous selection of beers, 140 on tap! And about 100+ bottle available too.  Certainly a rowdy place to watch a game as it does get very, very crowded and LOUD!  So IF you want Great BEER, then you'll love this place. If you're expecting good food, SKIP it.",

    "text": "WARNING!!! Do not go here unless you are getting nothing but beer.  I do not suggest eating anything here. Coming from someone who has been working in the front and back of house of restaurants for a few years, this place has some work to do. To start off I arrive with a few other friends, we get sat right away which was awesome. Our table had a beer spilt on it and the host decided not to wipe it down for us so our menus ended up wet and stuck together. She proceeded to tell us we will be helped shortly. It took a while for a waiter to greet us and ask for our drink orders. The drinks took at least 10 minutes to get to us when they were mostly waters... It was understandable that the beer was a wait because the bar was understaffed. Others at the table enjoyed the beer more then the food. We ordered Guacamole and Queso as our appetizers and they were just ok, the chips were obviously mixed in with old stale ones. The queso was cold and the guacamole was probably the best thing I had eaten that night. Finally after 30 minutes or so our waiter comes and asked for our order after passing by us multiple times. Throughout the whole night my friends were going to the bar to get their drinks because our server was taking to long. The food took about an hour and a half to get to us. It shouldn't have taken that long to cook a couple burgers, tacos, wings and chicken tenders.  The wings were hard and seemed like they were fried to a crisp or sat under a heat lamp for 20 minutes, the tacos were cold and the burgers were practically just browned on the outside and almost completely rare in the middle when we ordered them medium well and medium rare. The chicken tenders were the most fresh out of everything. I had to get a manager for help because our waiter had seemed like he forgot about us after the food arrived. In the waiters defense, it got a little busy later in the night, but that was after we had been there for almost 2 hours trying to get their attention about the food so we should have been done eating by then. The manager helped us out and told us the kitchen would be notified about this. The waiter was nice at the end of everything because they were at fault. Overall I give this place a 1 star for the food quality. Service was so-so. They really don't deserve to be located in the Piedmont Row South Park area at all.",

The chicken nachos - BLAH.  Let me let you in on the secret to nachos.  Don't put a giant pile of nachos on a plate and then put the good stuff just on top.  You need to LAYER.  Otherwise everyone fights for the top couple of chips and the rest is just wasted.  HELLO.  The beer selection is fantastic.  Tho they did not have Hopslam - bummer.  Only the best places do.  They did have a Great Lakes beer on tap tho (just one!) But that is fun.  I have never seen so many beers on tap.  I can't wait to go back just for that reason.  If you are not sure about a beer then they will give you a little taste.  Very nice!    Parking is easy right behind the building there is a parking garage.  There is a little patio out front which will be awesome in the summer.  Will be back - not my fav sports bar tho.",

I should've known better than to go back after a few other bad experiences, but considering it is in such a pretty location, I thought I'd give it another shot. The service is ATROCIOUS. We waited about 25 minutes for the first beers to come and about 45 minutes for the server to come just to take our order (as we sat with empty beer glasses). I work in a restaurant so I understand sometimes it gets busy and hectic, but it was SLOW. There was ZERO reason for our experience to be the way it was. The beers were flat and warm (tasted like they haven't cleaned the taps in awhile), the food was chilly (seemed to be sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time), and our wait time was never acknowledged by any member of that staff. Yes, they have an extensive beer list, but so do many other quality restaurants in the general area (Duckworth's on Montford is a great example!). I will NEVER go back and I highly recommend that you don't waste your time and money on this place.",

Ok - so the food was marginal - had wings and fries - Fries showed up stone cold - wings were ordered dry rub extra crispy - still bloody and too wet.  Now to the server and abusively lack of service!!  There is a chain called DICKS where wait staff knowingly abuses customers - did I make a wrong turn?  This server should not be working a busy sports bar on Sat ngt - or any night - or even be a server!!!   Honestly don't argue with customers!!  Don't get in a side conversation with the hostess when you have our drink refills in hand and empty glasses on the table - an on it went!  To recap - marginal food and poor service - add to that a myriad of places to eat within walking distance from this location - how do they survive is beyond me - but I assure you that it will not be with my support - nuff said.",

    "text": "My choices were limited as I just arrived in town Sunday night for an all day meeting Monday.  After checking into my hotel, I hit up ol' faithful to help me find a bite to eat nearby.  The last thing I wanted to do was have to drive anymore after dealing with post holiday traffic entering Charlotte.  I ended up opting for Taco Mac because it was a stone throw away and I could grab a beer and catch up on fantasy football stats while I waited for my take-out order.  I sat down at the bar and waited as the bartender went about his business.  It was obvious he wasn't much of a people person as it took him about five minutes to acknowledge me by setting down the menu in front of me while he finished a conversation over the Bob Cat's game with a passing server by yelling through me.  I ordered a beer and opted for a Chicken Caesar salad and a six pack of boneless habanero bbq wings (reasonably healthier than what  my guilt free conscience would order).  The order took about 20 minutes, but I was occupied with the big screens behind the bar.  After my food arrived, I closed my tab and headed back to the hotel with the food and was back in no more than five minutes.  When I opened the containers, I was surprised by how poorly my order was executed.  I ordered wings with celery and ranch, but what I received was french fries and blue cheese. Okay, no big deal.  Looking at my wings, it looked like they gave me way more than what I ordered so that made up for the error...but after biting into the wings, the breading was so thick, it practically overwhelmed the chicken.  They were also very sparing with the sauce on the wings, so it made for a very dry crunchy bread bite.  Since I received fries I figured I might as well enjoy 'em.  After a few, my taste buds were locked on a flavor of Salt & Pepper UTZ chips (a personal favorite).    Moving on, I decided to check out my Chicken Caesar salad.  I popped the container open and on first inspection everything looked fine, but I thought they forgot to include a container of dressing to accompany it.  Wrong!  They pre-dressed the salad and by the time I opened it, everything from lettuce to croutons were beyond savings from absolute sogginess.  The chicken was spared though as they grilled it above and beyond, resulting in charred-dry chicken strips.    Overall, not impressed.  Food can be easily fixed, but the service will require bigger strides to improve customer satisfaction by doing things right and respecting the customer. My realistic rating is 1 & 1/2 stars culminating from service experienced, mistakes on my order  and food execution flaws.",

We had heard about this restaurant and how it came to be in Atlanta by a couple guys from Buffalo, NY. The story is awesome and the owners being from NY I had high expectations for some good chicken wings.  Overall, I was really disappointed on the food. My grilled buffalo chicken wrap was probably a 2. The chicken wings a 3. The sweet potato fries a 2. The best things I tried were probably the queso dip and blue cheese.  While the food was mediocre, the place itself is nice and spacious. I'd come back for their extensive draft list and TVs. It'd be great for a big sports game if you have a big party or want to sit at the bar.",

    "text": "I will say the hostess was nice and we got sat right away. Our server was also very sweet. But there were a few things that we weren't crazy about.   1- I ordered a BOWL of the chili. It's almost $6. When I got it, I couldn't believe how TINY the so called bowl was. It was so small I even asked the server if this was the bowl and not the cup and he said it was definitely the bowl. My husband was so turned off by it he started to look it up to see if it really was a bowl by looking at other yelp pics. If that was a bowl for $6, I would hate to see how small the cup was.   2-We ordered the 20 wings with tater tots in the hot buffalo. We asked for one ranch and one blue cheese. We got our wings and I got my ranch but my husband wasn't sure if he got his blue cheese. He tasted it and said it was definitely ranch. So we told our server and he got the blue cheese. No problem right? My issue was that we were charged for the blue cheese. Even though it comes with two dressings and originally wanted one ranch and one blue cheese. But because my husband tasted to see if it was blue cheese or ranch, we got charged for it. I get it's only .80 cents but really??   3- We ordered the hot buffalo wings. After a wing or two I noticed the sauce to be very sweet. Not spicy at all. My husband even said something to me and we both agreed that it did not taste like hot buffalo. We asked our server and he said that he put in as hot buffalo. He asked if we wanted to have more hot buffalo. We declined but asked for the hot sauce above it. Makes we wonder if they use the same bowls to toss wings in even though people ask for different flavors because it definitely wasn't buffalo.   Not the best experience.",

I also had some of my husband's mac and cheese which was good. The soup was good, but not great. My husband enjoyed the tacos he got.   The service was not very good. We couldn't find anyone to ask for our check so we had to get up and ask someone. It took them a long time to take our orders as well.

I typically start with the bad and finish with the goods but this is the exception. I've been coming to this T Mac off and on for 2 1/2 years. The staff turnover is crazy! To see the same face is pretty rare. The worst thing about this location is the fries!!! Anthony used to be the bartender and ensured that our fries would be fresh. Now that he is gone, my fries almost always cold and hard. I even decided to go with tots as a counter measure. The service is extremely slow. For call in orders they say 15-20 mins. I always give them about 30 mins and still have to wait a nice amount of time before my food is brought out. If you go in between 1130-1pm its always a crowd of people waiting around at the front hostess booth asking each other if they have been helped.  The fish and chips are good(if you get fresh fries) and also the chicken tenders. The burgers are hit or miss. The wings were never cooked all the way through so after three different orders I gave up. If it was not for slow service and cold fries T Mac would be the perfect lunch spot.  Why go back one may ask...convenience when the other options are fast food or fine dining.",

My husband wanted to play golden tee, but it wasn't working so the bartender told us she thinks it was cash only and I said there was a CC machine picture showing on the machine. She called over the manager and while he was helping she began talking shit about female customers like me to a single male sitting at the bar assuming I couldn't hear her. Then, my husband couldn't find his Cell later in the evening and when someone from our table asked about it she began to talk more shit about me even though we switched servers to avoid confrontation. We won't be back and I will 100% make sure of that...as the female she openly spoke poorly of to gain more money from a man.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, the name on the sign is spelled wrong. It should be Taco Meh...  Finding other nearby restaurants busy with long waits, we strolled into TMac for a leisurely dinner. Good thing we didn't have to be anywhere soon.   We were seated quickly but it took about ten minutes for anyone...anyone! to come to our table after we sat down.  (BTW, Taco Meh practices \"As Needed\" table cleaning on the patio. Just about every single table was dirty with crumbs, papers, or liquid spills. Tables were only wiped down after a guest was led to the table. Some had what seemed like permanent stains that hadn't ever been cleaned. This left the outside area feeling sort of dirty.)  When she finally arrived, the waitress was unaware of the Thursday night beer special (some sort of \"take home the glass\" special that we didn't pursue) and, again, took over ten minutes to bring our beers. We thought she had forgotten about us. Then she came bounding up pleasantly enough announcing, \"I didn't forget about you.\" We think she had. So - 20 minutes in and we finally have waters beers - \"Huzzah!\"    Leisurely chat over pretty good beer was pleasant enough on a balmy fall Charlotte evening. The food - one burger and two orders of Philly chicken-cheese over fries were passable in temperature and taste. Again, though - meh. Nothing to write home about - but worthy of writing Yelp about.   The atmosphere of the outside seating was pleasant but our group agreed that, given the chance, we will not dine here again.",

It was after 1:00 and thought we were in the late side for lunch. Anyway, I ordered fish & chips and my wife ordered grilled chicken tenders.    Fish & Chips were lame; like you'd get at some CHEAP fast food restaurant.  Small portion and barely warm fries.   Chicken Tenders were dry and not much flavor.    Neither entree was more than warm. Why?  Well my guess is because our waiter / bartender left our food sitting in the kitchen.  I was wondering what had happened when shorty thereafter someone else served it.   Doubt I'll return and the prices aren't any deal.",

My daughter had the chicken tenders which were great. My wife and I shared the roasted hot wings and the chipotle ranch burger. The wings were good and the burger was OK.   I has a couple different beers which were good, but served in a glass that is not equivalent to a pint (somewhere between 12 and 14 ounces).   My wife got a moscow mule which was overly sour and a Long Island ice tea which was really good.   Overall, we would likely choose somewhere else.",

The place has a typical chain restaurant, sports bar appeal. Lots of TV's, if there is a game on you should be able to find it on one of the TV's. When you first approach the place you see all of the outdoor seating, which is nice if you are not interested in the sports bar scene inside. Once you walk in you see that the place is huge. Tons of seating, some of the tables have taps at the table. There is also an upstairs seating area. The place is very chain restaurant esque.  The service was slow and not overly friendly. I don't know if the place was understaffed when I was there or if they are still getting used to thier jobs as the place has only been open for a couple of weeks.  The menu was OK, nothing special, but not bad either. Reminds me of a Ruby Tuesday or TGI Fridays. I ordered a burger and fries, and had no complaints. The beer menu us huge (140 taps), an awful lot of those taps are devoted to Macro. Really there were only a couple of taps that I was really impressed with.   This place was not bad, but I think Duckworths is still the best beer destination in Charlotte.",

After the waitress arrived and took our appetizer and drink order (4 Moscow Mules and 1 beer- not too complicated!), we waited over 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive- and only did they arrive after we spoke to a manager. We asked for a second appetizer that showed up after our meals arrived (they also brought out the same meal three times). The food was decent, but certainly did not make up for the absolutely awful service we experienced during a dead lunch hour. Once our checks arrived, we asked to speak to a manager to take our drinks off (which they should have done from the beginning). It is clear that providing customer service is not a pillar of importance for this restaurant and never again will I set foot in this establishment.  Update- I spoke with Kay, the GM, and she immediately remedied the situation. She was a pleasure to speak to, and i will definitely give Taco Mac another shot when I'm in town!",

We then waited another 5-10 minutes before asking for a waitress. We had 3 different ones in the next 5 minutes asking is someone had taken our order. We ordered beers and waited another 5 minutes and one of them was delivered incorrectly. Our order was 6 boneless wings with fries, an iceberg wedge salad and a bowl of tortilla soup. We waited approximately 30 more minutes before the wings/fries were delivered. The waitress said that she asked for my salad to be redone because the lettuce did not look good (and it would be one minute). My soup was not brought out at that time. 20 minutes later after my tablemate had finished his food my soup and salad arrived - neither of which take a significant amount of preparation. It would've been fine but was told they were out of bowls so I got two cups of soup. Unfortunately one was lukewarm and the other was cold. We finally asked a passing waitress (not ours) to speak to the manager.  If any one of those things had happened, then I probably would've been fine. But all of those things happened and what we hoped was going to be a 30 minute meal turned into an hour and a half nightmare killing the rest of our night and errands. And the restaurant wasn't busy - the bar had some business but there were only about 5-6 tables with food patrons. One of the early waitresses said they were short staffed and we over heard them asking another waitress to bus tables. The only reason why this is getting 2 stars is because the manager did comp my food.  Needless to say it will be a long time before considering to come back if at all. It was my first time there and it was not a good experience.",

I love the endless selection of beers and the \"brew niversity\" gimmick that encourages you to try different beers for fun incentives like t-shirts, mugs, etc. The atmosphere is really cool. Big open space, lots of tvs with every major sporting event represented. Waitstaff is hit or miss. I've had some amazing servers/bartenders and some pretty bad ones too. Just depends on the night I guess.   a lot of people seem to dislike the food, but I think it's alright. I like the chicken nachos and the wings and the cheesesteak is pretty good too. But I'm rating it as bar food and not on the same scale as a fancy restaurant. To me, the draw here is the beer. Not every bar has the goal of having an endless selection of beer, and it does its job. And for bar food I think that it's up to par with a lot of the burger, wings, fried food places that I've tried.   It's definitely one of the better places to watch a game.",

I attended a work event which was very well organized. We arrived and were brought upstairs to a spacious room, overlooking the downstairs bar and tables. There were multiple TVs and a great amount of tables which we rearranged for our group. We had multiple servers that were great. We ordered pitchers, because there is a great beer selection, as well as individual drinks for the non-beer drinkers. Each table was served chips and salsa, which I can say was the best thing I ate while there. The salsa has a great kick and the chips were fresh and salty, just to my liking. We had preordered a variety of food items that were setup buffet style. We enjoyed quesadillas, wings, chicken tenders, hush puppies and onion rings. The wings, in my mind, ugh! I thought the quesadillas were no worth writing home about, no filling. The hush puppies, horrible. However, the chicken tenders were large, cooked in a light batter and delish. I do wish they offered more dipping sauces, as we only received Dijon. Overall, I think if you are looking for a great place to watch a game, enjoy a beer and have some decent food, Taco Mac is your spot.",

I went with a few friends after hearing how awesome this place was and although it did have some cool things like taps on the tables and a pretty kick ass beer selection, the food and service was not that great. Our experience started with being seated at a table that had drips raining down from the AC system. The waitress was very pleasant until we pointed out the constant dripping all over the table and asked to be moved - then she became very unpleasant. She said that it was only water and it was no big deal if it landed on us or in the food. We felt differently as we did not want water from who knows where in our food or on us. We were moved out of that waitresses section to a drier area. That said, after we moved to a different table, she came back and said she would still be our waitress. The service was not very good from then on and I feel it may have been because of our disagreement with what was acceptable and what was not. The food was OK... nothing to write home about. I would suggest going here for beer and appetizers only.  Maybe if I check it out again it will be a bit better.  I know I am jaded because of the service we got.",

I've had their chicken fingers (good), Turkey BBQ sammy (yum), chicken nachos (double yum)...I don't go here for the Mexican food, but I can't say I've had it here either. My husband, on occasion with a larger group, will splurge on the wings, which he says are delish and you can get them in range of \"hotness.\" Try it out and don't be a square drinking Bud Light drinker.

After the first hour of waiting and excuses from the waiter we asked to speak to the manager who never came. My husband finally went to go find the manager who was talking with another customer that was complaining about the same issue. When the manager finally came to our table, he had the attitude of \"Oh Well.\" We were also there during a time of a Panther's game...the televisions that we could see from our seats had the Seahawks game on. We asked if they could change the channel on one of the screen's and our waiter said the customer at the table next to us had reserved it to watch the Seahawks. Excuse me if I am wrong, but I thought I was eating in a restaurant in Charlotte not Seattle. Food was so-so. My family will not be back.",

Next problem was that I ordered a dessert but minutes later was informed that they are out of the item.  Then I proceeded to order a beer, which minutes later I also found they were out of, then this process repeated for 3 more drinks.  At this point I just decided that I obviously did not need to eat or drink that night.  The waitress was not apologetic at all and proceeded to disappear for so long that we actually had to flag down another waiter after waiting for close to an hour to get our checks.  She then returned to our table with the check and an attitude.  I actually live right around the corner and frequent the Piedmont Row area, but I certainly will not return to this Taco Mac.

We ask our waitress.  Naturally she has no idea about the game, but will make the request.  Ten minutes go by - still no game.  A small group of people are enjoying a hockey game on the main television that is far from the main sporting event of the evening.  The rest of the TVs are tuned to generic sports news.  We flag down a second waitress.  She'll check on it.  We're now watching the game on my phone while surrounded by TVs, almost none of which are showing live sports, much less the sole NBA playoff game of the evening.    Finally, more than halfway through the first quarter, a few of the TVs switch to the game.  Inexplicably the sound now doesn't match the main television, and there have been no apologies or explanations from anyone, but at least the game is on.    This is a typical experience at Taco Mac on Piedmont Row.  This is not a sports bar.  They have televisions that generally show sports, but there is no interest in actually catering to a sports audience.   Which is unfortunate, since the food is no better than that in a typical sports bar and the service is far worse.  Drink orders take at least 10-15 minutes, food orders 20-30.   The hosts and hostesses have no interest in attending to arriving customers.  The bar tenders and waiters have little interest in attending to seated customers.    It's too bad.  With so many beers on tap, a great location, a big menu, a late close time and a great featured TV, this place could be many things.  A good restaurant, bar or sports venue.  It is none of those things.  It stays open based on the location and built-in features, but the awful, inexcusable management will eventually put this place out of business.  I, for one, am done.",

The chili is very well done. Taco Mac's onion rings are thick cut.   I enjoyed Taco Mac's outdoor seating. It overlooks a fountain at the South Park location. The portions are very generous. My wife and I packed most of our entrees to go.   Taco Mac serves more than Mexican food. They are also known for Buffalo chicken wings and a large selection of micro-brewed beers. Sports fans will love Taco Mac. They have many large screen TVs with sports on inside. Definitely worth a visit.",

With their frequent beer drinker program - Brewniversity - you'll never want to drink the same beer twice.  The food is also pretty great.  My favorite is the Pacific Cod Soft Tacos - there is always a good portion of fish and it is not overrun by excessive filler toppings.  The house-made cole slaw, enchilada sour cream and house-made pico de gallo are the perfect compliment.  The service is typically fast and friendly, even when they are busy.  Game days are especially busy because they have a lot of televisions showing various sporting events.",

We finally decided on American Roadhouse, a quick service burger place. Then my dad mentioned Taco Mac, so we walked over to Piedmont Town Center. We were immediately seated, and the place was loud and busy.   Alabama vs TAMU was on, so naturally every time a big play happened half of the restaurant screamed. It was a pretty cool atmosphere. Our server introduced herself and quickly brought drinks with chips and salsa. My cup said Coke Freestyle on it, and naturally, my Sprite was disgusting. Oh well. I ordered a Hollywood Chicken Sandwich and my dad got wings. They both came out quickly, and after getting some honey mustard, mine wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it was decent sports bar food. Dad's wings were pretty good as well, but nothing we'd go out of our way for. The bill was $25, which was quite acceptable.   Taco Mac is a great place to catch a game. Otherwise, there are many other restaurants in the area with a superior food offering.",

The bartenders were very nice and as attentive as they could be on a normal busy night.  The food took an extremely long time to arrive.  When I went to eat my burger, there was a GIANT LONG BLACK HAIR on it.  I sent the food back right away.  My husband said he would wait to eat his food but if he did, it would be cold.  It took another 15-20 minutes to get my burger.  And then when it came, no pickle spear.  The manager never apologized or checked back with us.  When the bill came....guess what, they charged us for both burgers!  They took the 1 burger off.  I am very disappointed in their lack of customer service and overall concern they have.

You have your pick of the litter when it comes to beer. Taps are always changing but with well over 100 selections, you're sure to find a tasty brew. I usually just pop over here for a drink and on a nice night, the patio is the place to be.   The food isn't anything to brag on. Tasty but not memorable by any means and something you could snag at any chain restaurant really. Occasionally I'll grab an appetizer here but that's about the extent.   The service is truly hit or miss at TMacs. I've had good, on point service - usually by sitting at the bar - and I've had several, not just one, but quite a few servers at TMac that just seem confused or end up rarely coming back to the table, dragging out our visit. Last time I stopped in, our server was really nice... whenever she actually came over to the table... but messed up my food then told me they didn't have a beer I ordered. I then pointed to the tap handle and informed her, yes... yes you do and then my beer was served. Granted, she apologized but after being left for 15 minutes (no exaggeration) with dry glasses, all 3 of us at the table wasn't too pleased. She then brought my beer but never returned with my friend's beer. Like I said, this is pretty common in my experiences at TMac I hate to say.   Yet, prime location in South Park, awesome beer menu, and if you are looking for a game, they definitely have it - but if it's a big game, be sure you head over early to grab a seat or you'll be left without one.",

Considering there were about four people in the whole place, you would think that it wouldn't be too difficult to pay attention to detail. I ordered a grilled buffalo chicken wrap with no blue cheese and a side of ranch. First forgot my ranch. No big deal. Bit into my wrap, no buffalo wing sauce. They gave me the ranch chicken wrap. The waitress came back out with a small side of buffalo wing sauce. Ok? I guess I'll just pour it on my sandwhich myself. Its not that big of the deal, its the principle that she couldn't just take the sandwhich back and have the correct one made. Instead of saying \"I'm sorry that your order came out wrong, let me get this fixed for you\" I got \"they are pretty much the same thing. Here's some hot sauce.\" The chicken is usually tossed in the hot sauce, then wrapped. Thanks for the 10% comp off my bill and still charging me for the side of ranch that I ordered. That whopping dollar I saved will definitely get me back in the door.  I'll be shocked if this place survives much longer.",

We showed up around 10pm and were seated in the bar. We got some beers and then one of my party decided to order food.  That was an interesting experience.  He's allergic to onions, rice and a slew of other things.  It took some bargaining to order a onion-less, rice-less chicken burrito with fries that normally came with rice & beans, without an up charge for changing sides.  The burrito normally comes with tomatoes and lettuce as well.  The food finally arrived, and he began eating the burrito.  A few things were odd, there were no tomatoes or lettuce in the burrito.    We were also expecting only the rice to be replaced, and still get beans and fries - but alas, we only got fries.  NBD - we can deal with that.  However - a few bites in, what did we see? Rice.  After specifically stating allergies of rice and onions, there was still rice.  So now what?    We bargain again and try to find another item on the menu that we don't think will be an issue to order.  After some searching, he decides that its just not worth it.   At this point, its 11:30, I'm about to fall asleep and my beer is long done.  I keep seeing our waitress visit her table beside us, and I'm all ready to ask for the check.  She never comes back.  I can't even flag her down if I can't find her... I end up going to the bar and hope that they can track her down.  I wasn't too stoked on how they responded to my question.  Therefore, after at least 20 minutes of waiting and falling asleep at the table, we leave money on the table and bail.  First time I've ever had to do that.  I really hope this is a small, bad experience.  I've had great experience from that server before and very good food from Taco Mac, but it may be a bit until I return...",

We decided there were better options and left with nary a glass of water.   I hate to say it, but this location has made my no second chances list.  We found an excellent place on Morrison Blvd and had an enjoyable dinner.",

    "text": "I grew up eating at Taco Mac in Atlanta and my experience at this location was mediocre at best. Walking in, of course they have tvs on everywhere, but the volume was insanely loud. And you still couldn't understand what they were saying on the tv with everyone in the restaurant talking. Our waitress came around and we ordered some queso. It took a while to come out and she told us it would be on the house. When we started eating it, it wasn't hot enough at all. Almost rubbery. But we didn't want to complain because she told us it was free. We got our entrees and they were fine, but nothing special. What you would expect from food at a sports bar. When we got the bill, we were charged for the queso that we were told was on the house. At that point we were ready to leave and didn't want to deal with it anymore or argue over getting free food. We probably won't be returning again.",

    "text": "When my family moved here in 2013 we were so excited to learn that there is a Taco Mac in Charlotte. We immediately started going to the South Park location about once a month or so. Unfortunately, we have never really been impressed with the staff at this location, but we kept coming back for the beer selection and the laid back atmosphere. After today's meal, I feel like we are done. The whole experience was just a nightmare. They were understaffed. Which we can be empathetic about.   HOWEVER...  We ordered drinks that never came. Our appetizer came out incomplete. My $10 salad was almost all lettuce and MAYBE had an ounce of chicken on top. We were charged for four beers even though we only ordered two. A different waitress put hot food down right in front of my 15 month-old baby. My margarita was so watered down, I couldn't even drink it. And, the whole experience took over an hour and a half.   My husband almost has his PhD with the Taco Mac \"Brewniversity\". That's a lot of money spent at one restaurant! I'm sorry to say, we won't be coming back to this location and if we do visit s Taco Mac, it will be back in Atlanta.",

    "text": "Came in for a bite and a brew or two on a Saturday afternoon.    As Melissa B says, this is a great place to watch a game. Every seat has a great view of at least 4 TVs so you are bound to find a game that interests you.  This place is also HUGE!  There's a big 1st floor dining area but I was seated upstairs and there's two large seating areas there.  To go along with the size of the place the beer menu is huge.  There had to be over 400 selections with like 150 on tap.    The place claims beer and wings as their specialties.   So I tried both.  Well I attempted to try both.  Two of the beers I wanted to try they were out of.    For the wings, I asked if \"Hot\" was really \"Hot\" and my server said no which is what I find across many wing places.  So I opted for the next step up, the Three Mile Island flavor.   The wings were big and were juicy, the flavor of the sauce was ok but it still lacked the heat I was looking for and the more wings I had, the more I disliked this flavor.  Some of the wings I've had were even rubbery.     I thought the prices were a bit high here.  $30 for a few wings and 2 beers?  No thanks.  I don't think this place is worth returning to.  Too many flaws for $30.",

    "text": "I'm sure you can read the previous reviews and get a good idea on what this restaurant is lacking. Which is why it has 1 star from me...   But I would like to say that the manager I spoke with before leaving, Liz, was very polite. Going off how ALL the staff members were I assumed that would be her attitude also. Which was awful from everyone of them.... Luckily that wasn't the case. She was immediately apologetic and took full accountability on the issues. I wasn't just bought off with money for my next visit, or free meals either. She acknowledged the issues I brought forward and planned on handling them. I can fully respect a manager that is capable of addressing issues and is willing to take harsh feedback. Especially in person. So thank you so much Liz, honestly, you should go manage somewhere that's a fully functioning restaurant with staff who want to help invest in the company whole heartedly. Places like this taco Mac will burn you out.   Good luck to future guests. Fingers crossed for you. I don't think I'll ever go back or recommend this location.",

    "text": "Taco Mac, seems like an Applebee's menu, wings, sandwiches, burgers and salads.  In fact, those are the words out of Billy's mouth. I thought to myself and said aloud, I do not want to eat here. But we were pressed for time and couldn't go anywhere else.  I joked with Billy, watch the food be fantastic, since I was judging it without even trying it. I realize this is not fair, but it totally seemed like a chain restaurant menu.  We ordered a couple of beers off the expansive beer list, where is the Dewey Decimal System when you need it? The beer menu is alphabetical, so if you want to try something new, you have to read the whole column to find the type of beer you would like.  Maybe it should be divided by style, then alphabetical.  No drink specials, booooo.  They only have pint night one week night. We weren't on the right night, so I did not process this information.  Billy ordered chips and salsa and a Monterrey chicken salad.( I was going to a movie so I was just going to eat some of his salad.)  Copied off menu: Grilled marinated chicken atop crispy romaine lettuce with grape tomatoes, cheddar-jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, black beans, cilantro, and crispy tortilla strips.  Surprise surprise, the salsa had a nice kick and the salad was really good. The ranch dressing served with the salad was fattalicious! YUMMY.  Judging from the remarks from other Yelpers, seems like a place, that you might want to avoid at peak hours.  But to meet a friend, sit outside, drink beer and have a snack, I was pleasantly surprised.  Dear Corporate people at Taco Mac, let your servers untuck their  t- shirts. Please and thank you.",

Other than that, our experience was very subpar...and this is coming from myself and 6 friends at my table, and 5 friends that sat at another table in another part of the restaurant.  First off, we sat at one of the high top tables that had the built in beer taps in it. Great concept... but our taps kept spitting out all foam and no beer. The manager had to come by several times to try and fix it. And we were getting charged per ounce for all the foam!   Secondly, the food was AWFUL. Between the 6 of us at the table, only 1 person enjoyed their food, but this is also the same guy that will eat 2 week old leftover pizza. I had the fish tacos, disgusting and soggy. My brother had the salmon entree, which was dry and plain. The 6 others also did not enjoy their meal.   Lastly, the service was GOD AWFUL. Everything was slow for most of the night...but that happens at most restaurants during busy hours, so we let it slide. After we finished our food, it took the server 30 minutes to get to our table with the checks. It then literally took him another 15 minutes to run all of our cards, and he got several checks wrong. The worst part about this was one of the girls that was with us had to catch a flight and we told the server this several times. He did not try to hurry up by any means to accomodate. I think she made her flight though by a few minutes....  All in all, I would never go back. Neither would my 11 other friends who went with me that night.",

We went and waited by the bar until our table was ready and we literally had to chase the bartender down for drinks because he wouldn't make eye contact with us. The restaurant was understaffed and the bathroom was a disaster. When we finally got a table it took quite a while to be greeted.  I ordered a Caesar salad with a margarita in a rocks glass. The first drink they brought me was in a tall beer glass and was disgusting because it was premade syrupy, sugary margarita mix. Totally cheap. The chicken on the salad was just microwaved junk and the salad was soggy and wet. A friend got the steak quesadilla and it too was disgusting and the steak was so hard and rubbery that it took several minutes to chew. This food was no better than cheap, overpriced fast food.  I literally got sick after dinner. The ONLY good thing about this place is the amount of TVs for watching the game. This place could be soooooo much better if they would invest in experienced people, serve real food and decent liquor drinks.",

My boyfriend and I both ordered the same beer and didn't get a glass, when we asked our waitress told us they were out, but we saw couples that got seated after us get their glasses. Not a huge deal but annoying. It took our waitress about 20 minutes to realize we needed another round of beers, then brought us the wrong ones. I ordered the black bean burger and as soon as I took a bite it fell apart I couldn't even pick it up with a fork. I asked to speak to a manager but he was on a conference call at 11 at night.......I doubt that. Another waitress came over and told me it fell apart be they don't use rice anymore bc they don't carry it on their menu...but they have a new rice dish on their menu. I order black bean burgers at almost every place I go to and this is the only one that falls apart. My boyfriend ordered a flat bread and t tasted like it came out of a freezer and had been microwaved. Their prices are too expensive for their awful quality of food. I definitely won't be going back. It's in a great location, I hope it goes out of business and they put something much better in its place.",
