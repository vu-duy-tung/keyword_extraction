I had fond memories, but the Park Road location didn't live up to them.  My girlfriend ordered steak and eggs while I tried a half order of the French toast. Her steak was the best part of the meal.  Grits were OK, but nothing spectacular.  Biscuit was large and flavorful, but the French toast was lacking.  The cook tried to make up for the weak flavor by smothering it in raspberry sauce and condensed milk, but much was still lacking.  And prices were high for quality of food - disappointing overall!",

Found the space deserted, but this was probably attributed to the dismal and chilly rain.   Our server was kind and attentive, but that wasn't enough to erase some of the not so cool cons: although the fried green tomato appetizer was delicious, it was ridiculously overpriced - 7 bones for 4 tomato slices? come again?; the Southern Scramble was more of a Southern trainwreck... soggy, slightly bitter and the turkey bacon bits looked suspiciously like, well, bacon bits; above all though, the \"Orange Scented French Toast\" was the ultimate abomination - forget that jive on the menu, this was two pieces of soggy wheat bread drizzled with raspberry preserves and vanilla syrup. Yum?  Everything tasted decent and it's always nice to be able to get breakfast day or night, I love the apple butter and the fact that I never leave Flying Biscuit feeling bloated or overstuffed. I can only hope the presentation and quality is a little smoother the next time I stop in. And that they won't be playing Nickelback this time either.",

And chicken sausage, so I was ecstatic to have eggs and bacon along with my family and not think about eating a pig.  Some of their staff I think are a bit young and not as professional some others, sup watch put for those, they aren't bad, just a bit ditzy and distant, not as atentative as they should be to your needs.",

In fact, I see many words, such as decor, biscuits, service, grits, etc. These are all good words, and you can certainly use them to talk about the Flying Biscuit. However, when I talk about the flying biscuit, I really only need to use two words:  Turkey. Meatloaf.  Hey you guys, I am so in love with the Flying Biscuit's turkey meatloaf. I know, if you're a meatloaf lover, you'll wrinkle your nose at the idea that turkey could take the place of ground beef and pork. Well, here's some news for you: in this instance, turkey does not substitute. It surpasses.  OK, OK, I don't want to write a simplistic review, so here are some other facts: the decor is interesting, the clientele is even more interesting, and the service is sometimes good, sometimes iffy.

    "text": "No airborne breaded goods here! (although I would be 100% behind the idea)  I met my best friend for Sunday brunch around 1:00 and was informed that there was a 10-15 minute wait. The guy who was manning the host desk had an awesome mustache and was super friendly. The wait time ended up being less than that and we were led inside.   Our sweet waitress Monique greeted us, gave us menus and took our drink orders. I had browsed the menu online beforehand but seeing all of the options in-person slightly overwhelmed me (everything sounded and looked delicious!) but I stuck with what I originally planned on ordering: the Piedmont omelet with oven roasted potatoes. I don't care how \"dreamy\" their grits are, this girl does not eat them.   The interior reminded me of a bright, cheery country kitchen. I was also surprised to learn that they have somewhat of a coffee bar serving up chai tea (iced or hot), mochas, cappuccinos, lattes, etc. I just stuck with plain ol' coffee.  After our orders were taken, our food arrived pretty soon afterward. I was pleased by the size of the biscuit. Even though they go by 'Flying Biscuit' I was half expecting them to serve biscuits that were pretty small. Not the case here. Thick, fluffy, carby goodness. On the table, you have the choice to dress your biscuit with standard butter or apple butter (or both, you rebel). I went the apple butter route and it tasted just like Fall to me.   My omelet was delicious. Packed with chicken sausage and turkey bacon, cheese, and onions. So so so so good and would order it again. Mentally, I've already added this place to my rotation of breakfast/brunch spots and cannot wait to go as often as I can get the chance.",

    "text": "The Flying Biscuit is a nice breakfast joint mired in horrible quality control and poor customer service.  We came in around 10:30a on a weekday to find a nice atmosphere and a half full dining area. Their menu has a good spread of healthier options like chicken sausages and turkey bacon, and listed many items as gluten free. I ordered the turkey hash, excited to try both their \"famous\" biscuit and moon dusted potatoes. My mother ordered the buttermilk blueberry pancakes.  After a short while, our food was delivered. The turkey hash was different, although it made for a good breakfast option with the savory turkey and gravy over the potatoes. The famous biscuit was fresh, but really just a good biscuit, nothing that would inspire you to order a dozen. The potatoes were also just well done potatoes. They had good seasoning without being salty, but didn't really blow me away. I did think that overall, the dish could have benefited from not having cheddar cheese melted on top of the eggs. It didn't add to the overall flavor of the dish and served only to make the dish unnecessarily \"heavier\" and overcook my requested over-easy eggs (which I was warned might happen from the waitress).   Now, from this review so far you're asking me \"why only 1 star if everything was ok?\" Well, when my mother's food came out the problems unfolded.  First, the waitress mistakenly ordered plain buttermilk pancakes instead of the blueberry pancakes. Fine, mistakes happen. But when asked about it, she first responded by saying \"you said just buttermilk\" in an accusatory and annoyed tone. When we all corrected her, she gave a halfhearted apology and attitude and asked if she could exchange it. Not wanting to be a hassle, my mother said it was ok, but just to get her some fresh blueberries to put on top.   Now... drum roll please, for the moment you've all been waiting for. After a little while, our server came by with the blueberries. Just when my mother was about to pour them over her pancakes, she noticed something; some little white spots dotted around the bowl. Weird, so she picked out one blueberry, and then another and then another until it became painfully clear that all of the blueberries in the bowl had MOLD on them (pic attached). And I don't just mean a little mold on one or two blueberries, I mean A WHOLE BOWL OF MOLDY BLUEBERRIES. I can see it now, Gordon Ramsey taking that bowl of living fungi and once living fruit, mushing his fingers into it and screaming \"YOU'RE GONNA KILL SOMEBODY!\" Likewise, at the same time, I wanted to warn everyone in the restaurant that the blueberries had been contaminated not only with visibly growing mold, but also the spores of all that mold (trust me, I've worked in a lab and mold spores are no joke).  As if I need to justify my problem with this even more, imagine being served that mess, cooked inside your pancakes unknowingly. This was a complete and blatant lack of quality control. The kitchen staff and manager had those rotting blueberries stocked, and then sent them out in a bowl where the waitress, without looking, served it to a customer for consumption. Again, in the words of Gordon Ramsey himself: YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.   ITS EVEN BLUEBERRY SEASON! WE LITERALLY JUST PICKED SOME FRESH!  When pointed out to the waitress that the blueberries were moldy and rotting, she gave a simple apology filled with her typical bad attitude and whisked the bowl away. Another lady came by after and simply offered another apology about the \"mistake\". No offer to comp the plate of a mere $6 short stack of pancakes, no further apology or explanation offered. No attempt was made to make this right. At that point, we were discarded as valued customers. The bill came and we were charged full price for our \"wonderful\" meal. Wow. I'm surprised they didn't charge us extra for the mold.",

    "text": "Come with an empty stomach, because probs here are large (too large in my opinion, as 3 of our 4 person party threw away half of our meals with nowhere to keep leftovers on vacation). As far as menu choices, there is something for everyone. If you come often enough and venture out of your comfort zone, you'll discover a new favorite during every visit. The French toast with raspberry drizzle is a family favorite. I always ask for extra raspberry sauce on the side and split it between my French toast and biscuit. It's delicious on the biscuit! The chicken sausage has a bit of a kick, as a warning to all who aren't fans of somewhat fiery food. There is a lot of salt and butter in the grits, which is likely why it tastes so amazing. My husband likes to drizzle a little maple syrup on his grits, but I prefer it as is. I was with a party of 10, and everyone enjoyed their breakfast. When you top off the excellent food with exemplary service and a nice ambiance, you simply can't go wrong.",

So when my friend suggested we try this place I was really hesitant to say yes because everything on the menu has biscuits and grits. Anyway, I didn't want to be a downer so I agreed to go, I figured I could just replace them with other things. Our waitress was super helpful and suggested I give the biscuit a try and just replace the grits with potatoes, which I did (btw I got the steak and eggs) When we got our food and I saw the biscuit, it looked amazing and I am happy to say it tasted even better. It wasn't dry like I was expecting, it was so soft and fluffy, I've never had a biscuit like this one. My friend also made me try her grits and to my surprise, they were also amazing! This place has really made me reconsider what I like and reminded me that I always need to try things in different places!",

    "text": "Before our conscious uncoupling with Foodie Call we used to order from Flying Biscuit all the time, but I had not been to the actual establishment until this past weekend. I am so happy I am able to give a 5 star for my 100th review!   Going into it I already knew their food was great. If a restaurant can consistently deliver delicious food offsite I have high expectations for meals that only have to travel from the kitchen to the table.   We arrived a little before 10 am and had no problem getting a table for two out front. The weather was great and sitting outside meant we could hang out with the people who brought their dogs. I had no idea it was a dog friendly establishment and my furry companion will definitely join me next time!   Sitting down I knew I needed coffee and that somehow my order needed to include their chicken sausage patties. I am normally pretty picky about sausage but I love the sausage here. I happily ate both patties by myself. The latte they brought out was beautiful and delicious. I decided to order the turkey hash which is the best brunch dish. Turkey so tender and covered in a delicious sauce that it tastes like a pot roast served over potatoes. The whole thing was topped with two over medium eggs smothered in cheese. Perfection!   The biscuit that came with the meal was soft and warm (it is pretty hard when we had it delivered before so a big improvement). I drowned my biscuit in the delicious apple butter they leave table side for the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Maybe next time I will bring a large purse so the apple butter can come home with me...   I did not see the inside but I already know I will be back soon. The service was attentive and the menu is so unique and everything I have ever ordered from there has been absolutely delicious.",

Although there can be a wait on Saturday and Sunday mornings, it moves pretty quickly and I find the food worth the wait. The biscuits are always served warm, with a side apple butter, and a sprinkle of cooked sugar on top, my favorite part of the biscuit... As for the other options, the veggie omelett is my favorite. A three egg omelett with peppers, onions, spinach, mushrooms and swiss cheese. Perfect! I also love the chicken sausage.  Note: It does have a spicy kick so be prepared. And, I am not a grits fan so I always ordered the potatoes. However, I few weeks ago I decided to give them a try and loved them. They were creamy and not what I expected. I have ordered them ever seen.  Although the food is great the service can be hit or miss. They do like to \"turn tables\" so servers can seem rushed. And, they have so many tables at once you have to grab someone or be patient. However, it hasn't hindred my visits, and I know I will be back..maybe even this weekend.",

On weekend mornings, there is typically a small crowd waiting outside, but I've never had to wait long. There are a few tables out front, a cute, cheerful dining room (you can sit at the counter if you like), and a covered deck or porch out back with additional seating.  Service has always been friendly and attentive, but the real reason I keep coming back is the food. Every single breakfast I've eaten here has been excellent (they do serve lunch and dinner, but I'm so in love with their breakfasts, I see no reason to stray). Pancakes, French toast, scrambles and omelets--all of them are great, and so are the grits, potatoes, chicken sausage, and/or fresh fruit you can get with them.

It wasn't very crowded, and by the end of the meal, we could tell why.    The food was okay, but nothing to write home about.  I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT sandwich.  It sounded yummy!  What it was was three thin half dollar-sized slices of tomato on a rather bland hamburger bun.  I really didn't taste much of anything other than the bun and a smidge of goat cheese.  The cashew-jalapeno relish was delicious, but it all fell off.  It really should have featured at least a couple of big chunky tomato slices.  My partner's \"flat iron steak grilled to medium rare\"  included with his Steak and Eggs was pretty small and pretty medium well.    I guess we'll stick to breakfast time only at Flying Biscuit.  Maybe that's why they serve breakfast all day?",

    "text": "I recently discovered The Flying Biscuit Cafe through the ordering and food delivery service Foodie Call. I love trying new restaurants, and anybody that serves breakfast from morning til night is a winner in my book! That said however, just as a disclaimer: I've never actually been directly on location so I can't comment about their whereabouts, staff or service in general. I can however say anytime I've called ahead of ordering through Foodie to ask about any ingredients used, they have been more than willing to go look up anything I asked about, due to family food allergies.  As for their food though, everything I've had so far has been absolutely delicious! If you're looking for details on individual items, continue reading, otherwise, just stop here and know that The Flying Biscuit is great place to grab a good hot plate of food.  1) Their \"Spicy Shrimp Quesadilla\" is exactly as described, sauteed shrimp, white cheddar cheese, and lots of serrano peppers sandwiched in a flower tortilla. They don't scrimp on the shrimp or the peppers either, and when they say spicy they mean business!  2) The \"Blackened Tilapia\" is fresh tasting and seasoned well. It's usually served over their \"Creamy Dreamy Grits\" and topped with spicy herb marinara sauce. It comes with a side of spicy southern collard greens, which I've also ordered as a singular side dish. They're good, but not as spicy as I had expected, and not quite how I remember traditional greens being served, (a few too many stems) but a nice flavor just the same.  3) Their \"Egg-Stravaganza\" plate is great. You get two eggs any way you could enjoy them, chicken sausage, two slices of turkey bacon and their creamy dreamy grits. It also comes with a side of toast, and their homemade raspberry and honey creme anglaise sauces. The raspberry sauce is to die for, I mean really, it's that good! The eggs are always fresh, the chicken sausage while a bit of a different texture from the pork sausage that I'm used to is still spiced to perfection. They offer an option to substitute sides in and out on most of their menu items, so if turkey bacon isn't your thing you can always get pork bacon. Either way, it's a lot of food for one plate, and it's very filling.  4) The \"Pasta, Sausage and Eggs\" plate is probably an acquired taste, but I enjoyed it. You get three eggs, scrambled up with chicken sausage, spinach, mushrooms, penne pasta, covered in cheddar cheese and it's served with a side of their grits. The flavors of everything worked well together, but the texture was odd due to I'm assuming the grain of the penne pasta alongside the chicken sausage.  5) Their biscuits are always fluffy, and the apple butter they serve with it has a nice spice to it. 6) Their grits have a wonderful flavor and consistency, probably some of the best I've ever had from a restaurant. 7) Their seasonal fruit has always been fresh. 8) Their yogurt parfait with granola and strawberries is always a light and yummy treat.  9) The grilled macaroni and cheese is a favorite of everybody in my family, especially my daughter. I won't lie, those little crispy cheese edges are scrumptious. 10) Their blueberry pancakes are delicious, very fresh tasting, always fluffy. 11) Their \"Love Cakes\" were a little dry for my taste, but overall still pretty tasty.  12) Their Organic Oatmeal Pancakes are exactly what you think, oatmeal pancakes and it's our favorite item on the menu. They're topped with peach compote but we actually use the previously mentioned raspberry sauce on ours (or even the apple butter on occasion) and ask for the compote on the side, it makes for an amazing breakfast (or breakfast for dinner) and coupled with any of their various sides listed above, you seriously can't go wrong.  I look forward to trying more of their dishes, and continuing to enjoy all that I've had thus far. I was made aware about a month ago (May/June 2014) that they've been making some menu changes, so there are probably even more goodies at their actual locale to try, devour and deem delicious. Enjoy!",

Most places have no non-pork breakfast meats or probably cook them right after the bacon and sausage on the same equipment, but here pork is an afterthought that has to be specially requested.  My favorites are the Southern Scramble, the Turkeyloaf, Shrimp and Grits, and of course the biscuit itself (smothered in the apple butter)  Service has been a bit off the past couple times I've been and I pretty much had to blurt out my food order.  If it takes you several minutes to get my drink order I assume I won't see you for several more minutes for my food order.",

I was little skeptical when it came out looking like thinly sliced wheat toast with jam, but man was that amazing. The honey-vanilla glaze added a little extra oomph without being overly sweet.   I wasn't a fan of the biscuits. I think part of it was because they were so dense and everything else on my plate was so delicious.  I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Mmmm flying biscuits. Ok, the biscuits didn't actually fly here, but they were really good. The wife and I came here looking for a simple breakfast to go.  Flying Biscuit did not disappoint. I ordered for takeout over the phone and opted for some pancakes, a bacon/egg/cheese biscuit, some of the creamy dreamy grits, and grilled mac and cheese sticks.  Because who can say no to grilled mac and cheese sticks.  The place was a bit packed when we arrived so did have to wait quite a while for our food to come up, but I liked the prices here.  Nothing was overpriced, the range was very easy on the pockets.  When the food came up we decided to eat it at the bar.  I will say it disappeared very quickly.  The pancakes were pretty decent; but not anything special.  Surprisingly, the same goes for the grilled mac.  It was cool to get mac and cheese that looked like French toast sticks, but they were only \"pretty good.\"  If you get them, you want be disappointed, but you won't be pleasantly surprised either.  The biscuit on the breakfast sandwich was warm, buttery and good. But the star was the dreamy grits.  Everybody has grits, but it's hard to do them right - Flying Biscuit does them very right, lol.  I would recommend coming here if you're looking for your basic breakfast choices and want something decent; but I would recommend them even moreso if you had a craving for some good grits.",

Although the line can be extremely long on weekends, the staff always gets everyone sat in a very timely manner. Then the service is always very quick too! Whether you want a quick brunch or one where you relax and enjoy, this is the place. We took family here when they came in town and it was their favorite experience of all the restaurants we visited that weekend.   You can't go wrong with biscuits and gravy, I've had several of their omelettes which are all wonderful and the biscuits are great too!   This place will definitely continue to be a regular spot.",

My wife and I stopped in at noon on a Tuesday and sat outside to enjoy the cool spring air. We were helped right away by our cheerful waitress and got started with beverages, etc.   I settled on the breakfast bowl but subbed the turkey bacon for the housemade chicken sausage. My wife ordered the high flyer breakfast. About 5 minutes later we were staring at some attractive looking breakfast dishes.   The bowl was a real knockout, the grits have been raved about and they are quite good. I enjoy grits made with milk and cheese that still retain the great corn flavor, Flying Biscuit does a nice job with these. The sausage comes buried under the fried green tomatoes and eggs so don't worry, it's in there. Speaking of which was very nice as well, good flavor, not greasy, maybe a bit salty for some. The tomatoes were actually my favorite part of the dish, cooked perfectly and the tartness helping to bite through the grits and sausage. Two over mediums on top were perfect as well. The red sauce was the only part of the dish I didn't jump up and down about, had a bit of a canned tomato sauce kind of thing going on. It was sparingly applied so no biggie. The biscuit was perfect for sopping up the grit, grease and yolk concoction at the bottom of the bowl!   My wife scarfed her entire meal down without much more than the occasional \"mmmm\" or \"good grits\" so I'll leave the review of that dish right there.   Quality food, good service, maybe slightly, slightly overpriced. We will be back to try lunch!",

Lots of color, lots of fun scenes of utensils or animals and clouds...fun table settings and accessories. The atmosphere is very colorful and will possibly overload your senses.   The food was less than good and frankly, disappointed us. I had heard good things about this place and was eager to see how vegetarian-friendly it was. They do offer veggie friendly entrees, but it is by no means a vegetarian establishment. They LOVE their sausages and bacon! I wanted to try something Southern, so I tried the grits and biscuits (thinking they are their signature items). Coming from the West, grits are very foreign to me. Their grits were thick and tasted like they were made with sour cream. I was not a fan. When I think biscuits, I think \"plain, nothing fancy.\" Their biscuits have crystallized sugar on top. I know I highlighted two items, but we ordered more. I'm not going to review everything, since it was so disappointing and didn't make us feel good (not that we felt bad, but when I eat, I like to feel good about it).   Since it was the opening weekend, I expected high energy and enthusiasm. The server was great, but the manager or whoever that stopped by to check on us wasn't what I had expected for a grand opening. Not friendly, but not not friendly...just checking on us.   So, sad to say, this is not a stop we'll be making again.",

The food is wonderful and probably my favorite place to come for breakfast - not brunch although they do brunch the crowd the mimosas all of it - but breakfast for me this is the spot.  The turkey hash breakfast and the  eggs-stroidinary eggs (gosh spelling cannot be right on this item but I am too lazy to google it at the moment) are my faves for sure.  I love the funky decor on the inside and the fact that they have a few tables for outside seating as well. The portions are huge and every item I have had thus far is full of flavor. The coffee is ok but not the best ive had but hey its coffee and pretty much all coffee makes me happy.  I always bring my mom here when she comes in town its one of her favorites as well. The service is good and by good I mean they come they get your order and they don't mess it up. No frills and at times it seems I cant tell who the server is per say since we always get waited on by multiple people every time we come. I like it and we all leave happy. Kudos Flying Biscuit!

I enjoyed the cloud-painted wall, the strings of lights, the cool paintings towards the rear, and the actual flying biscuit yellow and orange wall paper. Plus I'm a fan of garage door style walls like the one that made up this storefront. I'm not sure why but it reminds me of SoCal and makes a place feel so much more open and airy, even when it is closed!  We specifically ordered their unusuals--the inside out (crustless, really) pot pie and the grilled mac and cheese. It was going to be an extremely foodful day and were were hoping to start light. Oh well. With just those two items ordered, we were both unfortunately full after our visit. And while I didn't care for the pot stuffing (not enough veggies, too much potato), the biscuits (just didn't like the taste or texture, not my style at all), or the mac and cheese souffle (too eggy/soft, not enough substance), my dining companion thought the pot pie and biscuit was the best best dish of the day (and we had about six meals that day). He really liked the practical and unique nature of the pie filling as well as how freakishly tall the biscuit was. Flying indeed!",

    "text": "The Flying Biscuit may have biscuit in the name - but the real star is their grits! I'm not someone who typically orders grits, but here they're a must! They're probably some of the best grits I've ever had. The biscuits are average. Nothing to rave about. They're kind of just there. If they didn't come with the meal I ordered I wouldn't go out of my way to have one. I've been here twice. Both times my fiance and I came here there was a wait, but it was worth it. We simply put our name in then walked around the shopping center until our table was ready. The first time we were here I got the Cajun Chicken Scramble. It was good and the portion was huge! My fiance and I got two separate meals but we probably could have just shared this. The second time I was here I got one of their sandwiches which came with a side. The side I chose was grilled macaroni and cheese. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it was interesting. What came out were blocks of macaroni and cheese in the shape of a French toast stick that had literally been pressed together then grilled. Sounds odd - but it was really good! I've definitely never had anything like it before. Overall my fiance and I really like it here. The food is very good and the staff is friendly. I wish there wasn't always a wait, but I guess it's worth it for good food.",

They have quite the extensive breakfast and lunch menu, so there is something for everyone here.   I ordered the Southern Benedict, which is pimento cheese, poached egg and hollandaise sauce on a homemade biscuit. This was quite flavor packed, and a little on the spicy side. I'm not sure where the spice came from, and it was almost too much for me, but my breakfast date thought it was perfect. I got it with their creamy, dreamy grits and they most definitely lived up to their name! I highly recommend them if you're a grits fan. Also, each table has a squeeze bottle of apple butter to go with their biscuits, which is another added bonus for this spot.",

The salmon was raw and cold, the mashed potatoes tasted gummy, and the green beans were ok. The entire entree tasted like it had been sitting out all day and then quickly reheated in the microwave. The chicken pot pie was overly salted and so bad that I packed it for my dog. As for the BISCUITS, it was the worst we have ever eaten. What happened to their menu?? We won't be returning!",

It was completely empty but super yummy so don't let that fool you!   We had the Lemon Poppyseed pancakes (special), a full size French toast, the Breakfast bowl, a Chorizo wrap, and chocolate chip pancakes.   All the pancakes were really good. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Flavor was so good.   The French toast was a bit small. Only two pieces of toast cut in half for the full size. And not as good as the pancakes.  Definitely not enough for a full size teen or adult.   The breakfast bowl was so good. The grits were the best I have ever had. (I'm from Arizona, but I am a big fan of grits.)   And don't get me started on the biscuits. The best biscuits ever. Huge and fluffy and great with the apple butter.",

Atmosphere: After a 20-minute wait, our party of 34 (yes, 34) was seated on their back patio. The interior was fun, but the patio more than accommodated our large group, and was equally enjoyable (if not more so; who doesn't love the fresh air?). Our servers were sharp and yet relaxed. Didn't miss a beat, and everything was prompt.   Food:  Get the Sledgehammer for your drink (5 shots of espresso and steamed cream). I got the Smoked Salmon Scrambler for brunch. Great ratio of dill cream cheese to smoked salmon; good stuff. The biscuit was flavorful (topped with a pinch of salt).   But the coup de grace was the grits.   My momma's from the south, but I was raised in NY; this means finding grits in any restaurant is a disappointment. But going on the word of my sister (who lived in Charlotte for a few years), I got the grits. And I ate them. And everyone else's who didn't want their side. Seriously, the best grits I've ever had next to my own momma's.   Negative: They only had XL \"OMG\" tshirts. We wanted 2 smalls and 1 medium. Bummer. Looks like we'll just need to go back.",

This location has only been here about two years but have definitely got a following.  We understand why!  Hubba-bubba got the orange-infused whole wheat french toast with a biscuit on the side.  The french toast was scrumptious!  I'm sure people swear by their biscuits, but I wasn't a big fan of them.  I did like that they have apple butter on the table, that was a nice touch...not quite my fave apple butter from Liverpool, PA, but unexpected & delightful in Charlotte, NC!    I got the High Flyer & fell in love with their creamy & yes they are butter-dreamy grits.  I liked the oatmeal pancake, but it could have even been a bit smaller as it is a very dense \"pancake\".    The service was as excellent as the food.  We are very happy to have found a new breakfast place that is low-key excellence!  Their decor is fun and bright without being overwhelming or kitschy.  They also have a front, sidewalk patio & a back balcony patio.  I think they have free wi-fi, too!  They also have an excellent Mocha!  That was delicious & served in a big-sized coffee cup.  For two breakfasts, our individual drinks & a to-go drink it was $25.  We liked the rest of the menu & look forward going back for lunch or dinner.  Yay for Flying Biscuit Cafe'.",

Whether it was the amount of people in the restaurant or poor service, our waitress was running all over the place and not paying much attention to us.   Food was decent at best. Grits were creamy as advertised and were the bright spot of an otherwise forgettable meal.   Don't understand the hype, Still on the lookout for a great breakfast place in CLT.",

I had the biscuits egg and gravy with grits my husband had an omelette with a side of gravy it was excellent! I have had tons of grits being from the south and these were creamy and GREAT I was skeptical about chicken gravy but it was some of the best white gravy as good as momma used to make!!

The menu is expansive for a place that serves only breakfast all day. Although there were numerous options, I ended up ordering the Shrimp and Grits. The grits were great, already infused with butter, milk for a creamy texture. However, I thought the ingredients that accompanied the shrimp would be better suited for a pizza. The sauce was heavily tomato based and there wasn't much else aside from tomatoes that was impactful on the flavor. It tasted fine, but I feel other vegetables and another sauce would have been a better compliment to the shrimp. The service here is spectacular and the prices are reasonable, with most choices falling below $10.",

    "text": "A Breakfast Perfect Storm...  Though there appeared to be a long wait, in actuality the wait was not bad at all, as my 2 peeps and I were able to get seated within 5min.  We sat outside at a table, the fans were def crucial due to the heat.  There also was a faint rotting garbage smell coming from somewhere nearby as well.    FOOD: Everything was EXCELLENT! Grits:  Yea, I know what you're thinking.  I've had grits before.  They're not that good.  How good can a bowl of grits be?  I had those same exact questions going through my mind as I was trying to place my order.  I'm gonna come right out and say it, do yourself a favor and get the grits -  these are the best grits I've ever had.  PERIOD.    Meggxican Wrap:  It contained, \"A spicy scramble of eggs, cheddar cheese, onions & Serrano peppers wrapped in a flour tortilla, topped with a warm tomato salsa and a dollup of sour cream served with creamy dreamy grits.\" (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flyingbiscuit.com%2FMenus.aspx&s=e718bdba308d154b281ad40d82ad643677562ce9428f96ae5974302d8c5f810a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flyingbiscuit.com/Menus....</a>)  I added bacon to it, which I highly recommend.  The  Meggxican Wrap come together perfectly.  All of the ingredients perfectly complemented each other - the cheese complemented the eggs.  The bacon complemented the onions and peppers, and the warm tomato salsa spread across the top complemented the entire the dish. (see pics)  Biscuit:  Being from NY, I must admit, I am not a big Biscuit guy at all.  I prefer bagels and crouissants .  To me, biscuits are too doughy, dry out your mouth and are hard to swallow (that's what she said, lol).  But the biscuit was phenomenal!  It was baked perfectly, doughy but lite enough to swallow.  I can't comment on the apple butter - didn't try it; didn't need to.  The Biscuit was perfect with a little butter and jam.    My overall food experience here was AMAZING!  Everything was prefect.  I cannot shower the food with enough praises!  Everything tasted freshly cooked and prepared.  Everyone I was with also enjoyed their respective meals.  My friend got the Southern Scramble, which I sampled and can also offer my stamp of approval for.    Service:  Service was excellent.  Waitress was very polite & friendly but not intrusive.   She refilled our waters two or three times (hey, it was hot outside remember).  Food was not exactly lightening fast in arriving, but sometimes you don't mind waiting if you know the food is being freshly prepared.      Price:  VERY AFFORDABLE for the amount of food that you get.  You can also add extras and sides for minimal costs.   This place is definitely here to stay... ..and I'll def be Flying with the Biscuit again soon!",

I was surprised to find out that they are a chain; I always thought it is a local independent joint. Anyway, I found myself a table at their patio and though it was only a Wednesday afternoon, they seemed to be busy. I ordered the southern style benedict without the turkey-bacon and a cappuccino - to be honest I was disappointed with my coffee. How can you possibly get a cup of cappuccino wrong? It was more like a cup of steamed milk with a hint of coffee. But when my benedict was brought out, I was a happy customer :) Two poached eggs served on southern style biscuits with a sundried tomato and basil gravy - very different from all the benedicts I have tried so far! If given a chance I would go back to try something else from their menu.  PS - Their grits are very rightly called creamy and dreamy :)",

They offer soysage and lots of other health food options. I don't know much about grits being from the North, but these grits were amazing. So amazing, that my friend ordered a side of them after trying mine. The server was super fast and super friendly, we had no issues even with our special requests and substitutions.  The biscuit itself wasn't super buttery/greasy like most biscuits; it was real good.  All-in-all this place was a win, especially if you're looking for healthier/vegetarian options!",

The ingredients are really high quality - super fresh eggs,  tasty local chicken sausage,  tender steak,  fluffy biscuits,  and the gold standard in grits.  I can't say enough good things about the Flying B! There is often a wait, but it is always worth it!",

Although the butter for the biscuits was good, but the actual biscuit was cold, as a result, the butter did not melt. The candied bacon was also cold so all of the grease penetrated into the bacon causing it to taste like grease and maple syrup. More than likely I will not return here during my next visit to Charlotte.",

It was crowded but there was no wait and we were seated immediately. Additionally, the service was good and the waiter prompt. The biggest thing I noticed was how quickly the food came out. We honestly waited less than 10 minutes after we ordered for our food. I had the shrimp and grits and it was good. They use a tomato based sauce, which isn't my favorite but it was still flavorful. Shockingly, the worst part of the meal was the biscuit. Plenty of parking as the restaurant is in a shopping center.",

I made the ugly face. I decided to wrap some up in a tissue and stick in my purse. No, I'm joking. I took two in a to-go container and ate one for breakfast the next morning. I mean, what place sells biscuits dense enough to eat for breakfast with a cup of coffee and be good??? I mean, I was good! With ONE biscuit!   I had the shrimp and grits and they weren't really all that. It was just shrimp, grits (which were amazing) and a whole bunch of stewed tomatoes. I'm used to shrimp and grits with onions, peppers and sausage. There were more tomatoes than there were grits and shrimp. I pushed most of them to the side of my plate  and, by the end of my meal, it looked like I still had half a plate of food left. Nope...it was just tomatoes.   Anyway, this seems like just a regular a** breakfast spot with good a** biscuits.",

I've been to the one in Atlanta so I can vouch for their food! Let's start with the good...  The good the mimosas, and food was good. Everyone's fav was the grits. The buttermilk pancakes are cool not the best I've had, also tried the oatmeal pancakes. They were pretty good.  The bad which takes it to 3 instead of 4/5 was the extremely slow service! The waitress was nice but the service was slow. The pancakes weren't hot when they came out and neither was the chicken sausage.  Maybe because it was a busy day for them. I'd come back if I'm the area but it's not as great as the one I went to in Atl",

It's a cute breakfast/lunch/brunch spot that's located in the Park Road Shopping center -- so there's plenty of parking (that's a plus!). Another plus, was despite it being a beautiful fall day there was no wait! We walked right in and were seated in the back covered area.  I came with my husband and parents when they were in town during the fall. I ordered the seasonal soup. It was a squash soup with actually really delicious croutons. The soup was creamy without being too heavy, but it was a little on the sweet side.   What totally miffed me ... the biscuits. They were hard as a rock on the outside and crumbled easily. I didn't think they were flavorful. I've read other reviews that were positive so maybe I was there on an of day.  Service was OK, not great, not awful.   I'll have to try it again and see if it was just an off day for the restaurant, but I was truly disappointed by the biscuit.",

Plus she put my money on the counter   THE FOOD: I ordered the Vegan Tofu BBQ wrap... I must have asked for extra salt times 3!! The wrap would have been good it was just to SALTY!! My co-worker order  the chicken salad that is $10 bucks ... well her salad looked like a side salad with chicken. My side with my Vegan Tofu was a salad...

They have plentiful seating move tables fast but the people pile in even faster.  Best breakfast dish on the menu is the flatiron steak and eggs. I know what most of you are thinking, breakfast steak you are probably going to get a flimsy select-grade sad excuse for a steak. Not here! I got a thick portion of steak (somewhere in the 6-8oz range) that was better than some steakhouses I've been to, definitely the best I've ever had for breakfast! It was served with eggs cooked however you like (even poached!), grits seasoned to perfection, and a funny looking biscuit so good I ordered a half dozen to go (ask for the apple butter if you get it to-go).  Our server Teala was a gem as well. Bold on personality, grand on service!  Thanks to everyone at the Flying Biscuit for making the Park Road Shopping Center a regular destination!",

It was a lot of egg based items on the menu. I went for the California toast which was avocado tomato on toast with a side of potatoes which was average. There is an option to eat in or outside, however the outside is in the middle of a sidewalk in a shopping center that constantly has people walking by you. The owners gained a lot of my respect for having special needs work the hostess stand, they were amazing and kept us laughing and smiling our whole meal!",

I guess with a name like flying biscuits you're expecting amazing biscuits right?, well these were not. I mean I guess they were not terrible but they were not soft and fluffy like they looked. The sausage is very dense too and hard to cut with a fork. Most sausage I've made at home slices easily with a fork, I'm not sure why theirs did not but it was strange? The grits however are super tasty because it has a lot of butter but who cares it was very good. I got a latte but it had too much steamed milk, i was not a fan. The sledgehammer was much better and is basically a breve, which is what I make at home all the time.   I don't know what to tell you folks, maybe their lunch meals are better than breakfast but I don't think I'll chance it again to find out. The flying biscuit gets an official rating of Meh in my book. On to the next one!",

About ~$45 for all four of us for food and coffees and of course 1 chocolate milk. Gotta have it. Waiter was funny, joked with us about their 80s music they had on. We got to sit on the patio and look out at the ACE gardening section next door. Loved it.",

The service was very good and the place is happy and upbeat, but the food, especially the biscuits, which is their namesake, left a lot to be desired.  I ordered the biscuits eggs and gravy and it was unlike any biscuits and gravy I've ever had. The gravy was over powered with an onion powder or maybe actual onions or whatever.  I couldn't get past it. it was very thick, almost to the consistency of stuffing, and it tasted as Bad as it looked. The biscuits were hard and crumbly.  I'm not sure if that's how they're supposed to be, but I can't imagine that this place gets such rave reviews with those kind of biscuits.  It was just all so odd. They do have a very large and varied menu, so if I ever find myself there again, I'll certainly try a sandwich and skip the breakfast altogether.  My niece did not eat her biscuit at all after trying a bite of it, but did enjoy the rest of her meal.",

I said a prayer and proceeded... Since I'd scrapped off the evil sauce I thought I'd use what I thought was H57 ketchup ... ... All I'm gonna say is idk what they used to refill those ketchup bottles but that was not H57 or ketchup for that matter it was uber rancid never tasted anything like it  the flying biscuit really let me down guys I was excited 3,000 miles before I arrived mission unsatisfactory",

After that, she didn't come back and check up on us at all.

The menu is extremely diverse and offers everything from light and healthy fare to hearty comfort food. Many breakfast joints serve dishes that are dripping in oil and heavily salted while The Flying Biscuit delivers flavorful and quality food that is not too heavy or greasy. Portion sizes are generous AND delicious. Love this place and can't wait to come back next time I am in town.",

    "text": "Not nearly the memorable experience I remember from last time. Things started out perfect; however, when our order came, they set a plate in front of me that was not my order and walked off before I could say anything. As I started using my fork to lift the top layer of food up to try and figure out what I had received, a lady comes by and says \"sorry this is yours\", picks the previously delivered wrong plate up, and sits it two tables down from us at another table. I was mortified. To me this is unhygienic . Once food has been given to someone and it's later determined that it's the wrong order...you should remake the plate for the person whose plate it is. The plate I got was eggs with gravy and biscuits; however, it was lacking a lot of gravy. Let me preface this by saying I rarely indulge in gravy as we all know it clogs the arteries. This was a weekend trip for us to Charlotte so I wanted to have some good gravy. I asked the waiter for some more. He told me I can give you a little for $1 or a whole bowl for ($3 something). I was flabbergasted. Wow...let's nickel and dime the customer.   Also, our waiter seemed very lazy as he would yell from a few tables over \"hey, hey, do you need anything\" instead of coming over and asking politely.   This place was amazing the last time we were here over a year ago. We will be back as everyone has off days.",

    "text": "We came here based on Yelp reviews, unfortunately we were not impressed. We came for brunch on Sunday, thinking there would be a line out the door because this place was rated so well but it was empty. There were 4 other tables, that should have been our first sign but our hunger overtook our common sense.  The waiter was friendly but did not bother to mention his name. We ordered the eggstavaganza, a kids meal ( flyer I think it was called), hash and eggs,coffee, chai latte,and kids milk. No refills offered.  The food was at best described as eh. Absolutely nothing special, we actually didn't even finish our plates. We love trying quirky restaurants but this one missed the mark by a mile.  This restaurant is touted for its delicious healthy food options by fellow yelpers but that claim fell flat on its face. Service was lacking, no fresh squeezed orange juice, the chai latte tasted like they made it from a box of Tazo chai latte at best, chicken sausage and turkey bacon tasted like rubber, and the biggest disappointment of all were the biscuits! They were dry, dense and burned, completely inedible. Just my humble opinion but shouldn't a place called The Flying Biscuit have phenomenal biscuits?!   Quick tip, if you ever find yourself in a seedy section of Charlotte don't worry just have a few of these biscuits on hand..a few teenage mutant ninja turtle moves later and you can ninja chuck your assailant until they flee for their life.  The only saving grace was the grits.. Who would think.. this Yankee now likes grits!",

    "text": "The Biscuits are Flying, out of the window!  If you name your restaurant after a food, then you better be exceptional at preparing that item.  Sadly, that isn't the case here.  Growing up in the south, I have had countless opportunities to indulge in biscuits from restaurants as well as homemade.  It upsets me that the flour taste of the biscuits here were very heavy and they were extremely dry.  Having eaten here 3 times now, I can safely say that they are great at reproducing the awful biscuit recipe.  I should not have to drown my biscuit in strawberry jelly and butter just to choke it down.  It should be buttery and moist, and full of southern charm.  I digress....  The vegetarian options are extremely limited, but if you eat eggs then it is okay.  I had the over-easy eggs on top of a black bean cake.  It was very tasty!!  They do sweet tea VERY well!  After our meal, we sprung for a cup of coffee because that's a southern requirement.  I am equally sad to report that the coffee tasted burned and we were merely drinking coffee for the sake of it.  There was zero enjoyment.  Thankfully a french bakery opened in the same plaza so they provided us with a great cup of coffee after breakfast.  The place is always packed, which would indicate they are doing something right.  But, they could be so much better if they focused on the details a little more.    Service is fast, floors are clean-ish, and the door host is highly energetic.  I would go back again under special circumstances.... BETTER BISCUITS!",

Sooo good - biscuit fluffy on the inside but not dense; nice crispiness on the outside. The sausage gravy was herby, creamy and balanced.. clung to the biscuit and was a mouthful of bliss with the eggs. The grits are probably the best I've had which probably means they are loaded with calories. That's ok.. I polished off what my wife didn't finish up.  Her eggs bennie were great - a bit rich with having pimento cheese in there. Turkey bacon not my fave but if I get to go back, I'm doing a repeat of what I had!! Happy Tummy!

This location in Park Road Shopping Center was just as yummy!  I arrived late Sunday morning.  The massive amount of people standing outside was a bit deceiving, since the wait was only 20 minutes...but the inside was deceivingly large!  You would never be able to tell from the small outside entrance.  The host and waitress were both very pleasant.  Service in getting our food was really slow, but the waitress kept the coffee flowing and was checking in on us.  She tried and I'm sure they were backed up in the kitchen, but a 30 minute wait for food after our order was placed was a bit much.  Once we got the food, it was great.  My eggs, sausage and potatoes were cooked perfectly.  I also got a short stack of chocolate chip pancakes, which came with two large pancakes.  Yeah, so I may have gone a bit overboard...don't judge.  With all that being said (and all that food being consumed), the winner was certainly the biscuit.  There is a reason this word is in their name.  Biscuits were CLEARLY made from scratch, super huge and were slightly sweet with sugar dusted on top.  I could probably just come back for the biscuit, but I'm definitely going to eat my way through the menu on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  Word to the wise...GO EARLY!!!",

After seeing many a Flying Biscuit without ever trying it, after living in Atlanta for several years, when the suggestion was made to go to Flying Biscuit for brunch I was looking forward to it.    I ordered the Steak n' Eggs w/ a substituted side of their grilled Mac n' Cheese and eggs scrambled with cheese.  Super healthy order.    The eggs were fine, what you would expect.    My steak was ordered rare and came out well-done.  They did promptly fix it and 10 mins. later I had my steak back while I was eating the rest of the food.  Overall taste of the steak was 4/5 stars, especially for a \"breakfast\" place.  Some of my friends were raving about the grilled Mac n' Cheese but I ordered it and wasn't impressed.  The grilled part of the grilled Mac n' Cheese makes it dry out a bit and have a strange \"grill\" flavor that is just not inherent to Mac n' Cheese in my book.  Overall, for $20 including tip, meal, and an iced latte - I've had way better brunches.  Would I try it again and order something different, sure but I'd probably stick with something more \"traditonal\".",

In my heart, when I'm hungry and I think of breakfast, there is nothing more satisfying than the perfectly executed PASTA, SAUSAGE & EGGS. Say what you will about the rest of the menu, but this is one dish that they get right every time. Given my dietary and lifestyle choices, I always ask them to substitute soysage for the sausage, which the kitchen obligingly does.  For this dish, expect creamy eggs with cheese, penne pasta, sausage (or soysage), spinach, mushrooms (and maybe a bit of onion) all scrambled together into a perfect melange of all that is breakfast.  Fire that up with an unbelievably tall and bizarrely sweet biscuit topped with a squirt of apple butter and a side of creamy dreamy grits and I swear, it will be worth the 10 minute wait on a weekend.  Their coffee is notably not the worst I've had.   Other interesting, veggie-friendly things to try: - Fried green tomatoes (a twist on the traditional) - Orange scented french toast (order extra anglaise -- trust me) - Clifton omelette (winner)  I'm sure their non-breakfast offerings are good, but I can't stray from my favorites.",

The grits were wonderful.  The place has a nice atmosphere for casual dining, and the wait staff tonight was excellent.  By comparison, their are better places for eggs. The flying biscuit will probably not be a place I will frequent for breakfast food fir supper very often  But they are unique and when I want to have good grits it's where I would go.",

    "text": "Great brunch/breakfast on a Sunday at around noon. At first, we were a bit disappointed by the 30 minute wait however in retrospect, it was worth it. Where do i start? I suppose we can review the highlights.  *Service - Friendly and quick. Appropriate number of servers, warm older gent outside the restaurant doing a nice job of keeping tabs of the waiting list and accoomodating the different size parties and available seats outside, inside at tables, and inside at the counter. Bravo to him! Wait service was very customer service focused with our waiter bringing an extra biscuit at the same time  the food bringer and he just let us have the extra freee of charge..well there you go, enjoy! We weren't charged for extra delciious little sides or any changes we requested.  They were very accomodating and for the amount of people in there, they were relatively speedy. *Atmosphere- cozy and more room inside than one would think. You can dine outside or inside and come with your family without issue. There was a group of 7 even that was accomodated. Casual and comfortable. You can wear whatever the heck ya please here. *Menu- was very surprised how many choices they had! There were about 15 different breakfast specials of which half were on my \"hmm i would love that!\" List. Our entire party of 4 had a hard time deciding! They have wonderful egg specials, oatmeal pancakes, french toasts, lots of aide dishes ans an ability to subsitute pretty easily. If you want lunch they had a pretty good variety there too with salads, sandwiches and fun lunch options. I would come.back for lunch because the combinations of food sounded amazing! *Food- finally, huh? Ok the food was delicious. Period. I had three scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and dill cream cheese and added grilled onions (that i saw from another dish that i was torn between) with a side of moon dusted potatoes (which was a subsitute instead of grits) and a biscuit of course. Note that all the breakfast specials  (which are served all day) all come with a biscuit. The biscuits are definitely very good but not amazing  (i guess after you've had Biscuit Head biscuits in Asheville, its a tad unfair to compare with those monstrous mounds of deliciousness ). The eggs were very good and they were geneous with the salmon and such. Potatoes were pretty good but i would have kept the grits as a side if I had known how delciious they were. I tried someone else's at our table and it was incredibly creamy and wonderful. Arguably the best i have ever had. I am not even a big fan of grits but this could change my mind! So to the other reviewer who indicated this was the best he ever had anywhere, we concur (although one person in my party claims to have had better grits at a place in Charleston however admitted this was excellent). As for other dishes, the whole wheat French toast smothered in raspberry compote (as part of Eggstravaganza) was unreal. We asked for extra of that raspberry stuff and layered it on our biscuits and it was TDF. The oatmeal pancakes were also wonderful and very filling. Hearty and super tasty. Another at our table had eggs underneath  smothered biscuits n gravy but it was not normal sausage gravy. It was chicken sausage gravy which was a fantastic alternative to pork (which i dont care for anyway) and was scrumptious and addictive. I believe the chicken sausage is one of their signature sides and is well worth it. They also offer turkey bacon with many of their dishes. This was probably the one item which was subpar in my opinion. It was the dry and chewy almost tasting like jerky. I love good turkey bacon and this was a let down. Please skip this item and order the rest of it because the rest of the food was incredibly good! *Prices - i felt this was a bit overpriced as each breakfast special was about $10 each. Certainly not out of bounds just on the higher side. I would exect 6to8 bucks each. Maybe I am being a little <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcritical.here&s=a56077c905ce160ee061e60c8837f9f4a4c9c95dd7c4a52068d7c286b0de4c84\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">critical.here</a> however even the sides were over $3 each. We dropped  $55 after tax/tip here with 4 people...seems reasonable for lunch but because we had just breakfast items i thought a tad high. *Portions -Generous so it helped justify the price. The biscuits and pancakes were very heavy so tread lightly and share if you're a light eater! I am a heavy eater but my plate plus nibbling from others combined with an iced coffee made me quite full. The women in our party gave upnhalf way through...lol  Wish i could give 4 &  1/2 stars. Everything except the turkey bacon was delish and service and menu were excellent. I would not hesitate to go back and you should go if youre thinking about it. Be prepared to potentially wait....by the way, this is in a busy strip mall.but there is plenty of parking. I suggest you arrive 30 minutes prior to when you would want to sit down just so you can get a table if theyre swamped on a weekend like today.  Bravo to this place though. One of the best breaskfasts/brunches  in all of Charlotte!",

The server that I explained this to told me she would ' tell them in the back' but never replaced my biscuit. The service, in general, is terribly lacking. Twice I have been there and twice told that my silverware was filthy because of the dishwasher. I am told this is a great place to eat. My experience tells me differently. Still, if you are an adventurous hipster you may well like the atmosphere and hip disservice. Enjoy.",

I'm usually the one who prefers to eat light at home for breakfast and have a nice lunch out. But every now and then you want to try new things, so we gave the flying biscuit a shot.   We both enjoyed our food and noticed that a lot of the dishes had a more healthy twist to them. I think that I'll enjoy the flying biscuit when I'm in the mood for it, but I think that my wife and I are more traditionalists when it comes to breakfast. She's a big fan of bacon and I tend to enjoy pork sausage. I do remember enjoying the pancakes and she enjoyed the grits, but outside of that I think I'm more in my comfort zone at Waffle House or ihop.  But the service is terrific and the food is done well. I'd come back if I was craving that type of breakfast.",

    "text": "This place has great food and a nice atmosphere. Everything is very vibrant and colorful... And don't worry, there aren't really biscuits flying towards your head! I had the bacon and cheddar chicken sandwich. It had a good flavor and texture. The potatoes that came with it had a good combo of spices, but they could have been crispier. Tilapia was flaky and well cooked, and the shrimp had a nice zingy spice to it. Didn't try the grits as I don't care for them (it's a textural thing), but family members liked them- said they had a fair about of salt and garlic. Now for one of my favorite parts. One of their specialities is grilled mac& cheese, and it was really good! Had a good crisp with plenty of traditional mac&cheese flavor- you have to try it! Finally, what you've all been waiting for, THE  BISCUITS!  So , let's start with the inside. Fluffy, airy, soft, other various synonyms.. just pull off little pieces and let them melt in your mouth. Now the outside- crispy and crunch with the tops dusted with sugar! Yum! The sugar goes perfect with savory other foods like grits and potatoes. They offer apple butter which my family members liked, but I thought they were good as is. Next time I want to try their breakfast selection, but diffidently good for anytime of day! I'd give them 4 1/2 stars, only problem is that the seats were dirty and we had to wait for a little bit to be seated even though we got there early and they weren't busy.",

Yes most of their items on their menu is a good bet for breakfast/brunch/lunch... but I think my favorite time to go is dinner.  1)  The place is not as busy and crazy and 2) who doesn't like breakfast for dinner??!!??  It's practically a staple at my house (especially when I moved out of my folks place and the main thing I knew how to cook were eggs).  I REALLY like the art on the walls.  I recognized a large piece from a local artist and I am sure most of the other pieces are probably local as well.  Good to promote the local art scene and makes for good breakfast for dinner conversation.  Everything I have tried thus far has been super delicious and well cooked.  It also helps that the items won't hurt the wallet/purse as bad - very comparable to other breakfast spots around town.  Bottom line:  watch out for weekend crowds, but this place is golden.",

The restaurant had a little but of a line out the door but we were seated within 10-15 minutes of arriving. I love that mustache guy   Service was good I had a giant pumpkin spice latte, it was HUGE!

Eggs and chicken sausage were also great, service was really friendly and the atmosphere is inviting. The only negative I will say is the starches are not their strength. I would stay away from items like french toast and the oatmeal pancakes. Those are really heavy and not what you expect.

It was served over an egg (cooked however you like) on top of a split biscuit.  Yum!  The meal comes with a side of grits but I got potatoes instead which weren't all that great.

Our waitress was very cheerful and attentive, and the decor is comfy while being bright :)  We split the black bean cakes w/ feta, onions and tomatillo sauce and they were ok - the patties are not cooked in any way, which I wasn't expecting.  I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT with a side salad and it was very good. I did have to ask for some of their Red Pepper Aioli sauce to add some ZING to my sandwich but the side salad's balsamic was one of the best I've ever had! My friend got the shrimp quesadilla and it didn't look impressive to me, but he said it was good.  Overall, I'd go back to try a biscuit at least! :)",

The menu including about 50 different omelets, and they allowed me to mix and match any of their sides.  I heard the creamy dreamy grits are to die for, but I got the home fried potatoes and was far from disappointed with the decision.  The biscuit was the best part (it better be, its in the title).  It also comes with a side of apple butter that I devoured.   I got the Piedmont Omelete and it was HUGE and scrumptious  The only negative side is that the wait can be crazy.  That's a good sign though, right?  I came back the very next day to bring the Mrs there and it was an hour wait at 11am.  Yikes!  i would definitely suggest giving this place a try during some off hours.    Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

I was in the mood for some biscuits and gravy so I ordered this, Got my eggs over easy and sub'd the grits for potatoes. An awesome portion of food and great presentation. I forked my first bite, watching the yolk spill over the biscuits and under the gravy. :) I'm a fan!  We went around 10am on a Sunday and they Just started a waiting list. I was the second but got seated in a minute. They have PLENTY of room. We sat in their back patio which I didn't even know they had. Very nice. Our service was wonderful. I can't wait to pay another visit.",

They put sugar on top of perfectly good biscuits, they put sugar in otherwise delicious grits, and then they serve only turkey bacon and chicken sausage.  Pork is the State Vice, for goodness sake, why serve breakfast meat that does not have pork in it?  The array of omelet and egg dishes is quite impressive.  I enjoyed the Piedmont omelet despite the pointless pork substitutes.  OTOH my wife's potatoes were lukewarm to cold, and her eggs definitely were not cooked as she ordered them.  The service was impeccable and the decor is adorable.  I can see why the place is so popular.  But their choices are not for me.",

Ordered the High Flyer, which came with eggs, chicken sausage, grits and a biscuit. Also came with an oatmeal pancake on the side. Was surprised by the food. All this for $8.75...great price I thought. Grits were AWESOME and the biscuit was warm and soft. The pancake was a little dense for me, but had a good flavor in the couple bites I had. Service was attentive and cheerful. All and all a great meal and I recommend the joint.",

Instead of receiving the poached eggs, bacon, hollandaise, and pimento cheese like the menu describes.... I got scrambled eggs, gravy, and jam.  When I called Foodie Call (the delivery service I used for the take out order) to let them know I got the wrong order he was very helpful and said he would get the right order delivered to me.  He then calls back to tell me the manager said she checked the order herself and that I got the right thing.  I explained again what I received and how it was different from what I ordered!  2 hours after I originally ordered my breakfast I got what I ordered! And the flying biscuit cafe had the nerve to ask for the wrong order back!!!! We will never be patrons of the flying biscuit again.  I don't mind a mistake but to go back and forth with a customer when the restaurant is wrong is inexcusable!",

We waited over 15 minutes my credit card back after giving it to the waitress and eventually went inside to find it. I think this is partly due to being understaffed.   -We sat outside and they leave their maple syrup on the tables. Bees were EVERYWHERE. The hostesses were swatting them and spraying them with whatever they clean the tables with.  -The biscuits are terrible. I would think if you have \"biscuit\" in your name and they are included with every meal they would be decent. They are dry and flour-y with sugar sprinkled on top. Any fast food restaurant has better biscuits.  The blueberry pancakes were pretty good as were the grits, but in the end it wasn't worth the wait and hassle.",

I stumbled upon flying biscuit years ago when I attended UF and they had a location over there. Through the years I have attended several locations in their home state of Georgia. I have had pleasurable dining experiences for the most part.  The location is Charlotte is conveniently in a nicer strip mall with plenty of parking. I came here just when they opened for a nice hot breakfast instead of paying for the hotel's ludicrous breakfast buffet. I had a coffee, which I did not enjoy. The roast is not great  I ordered the southern scramble with a whole wheat biscuit. As others have said, the biscuit had an overly flour taste that ruined my biscuit experience. The eggs were tasty but a bit salty. The best part of my breakfast were the grits.  Will return but may try something else.",

I got the salmon scramble. It was really just okay I feel the description sounded better than what came out. It tasted good but seemed pretty basic. The biscuit it came with was not very fluffy and was a little hard.   My friend ordered the fried green tomato appetizer and that was just OK as well. The tomatoes were a little flimsy and it was more breaded than fried. The best part about the dish was the topping it had. Maybe this was just an ordering mishap but this place wasn't for me.",

We walked in and a guy sat us in a booth which was near revolving doors-so we heard everything coming in and out of these doors.   It was not busy here at all. The waitress came by gave us menus and asked us what we wanted to drink. When she returned with drinks, she asked what we wanted to order. You would imagine she would give us a clue as to the specials or other items of interest on the menu. Nothing.   Asked here what kind of steak was the flat iron, and she was able to answer the question. So we placed our order. When the food came, we felt rushed. She came by to see if we wanted to package our food. I said okay for a container. She came back with a container. I was still eating the steak n eggs. The biscuit was hard and the grits was salty. Waitress then came back asked if this was going to be together or separate checks.  We did not leave until I finished the egg and a piece of the steak. Ignored the waitress as she walked by looking at the checks and spent time catching up with my friend.  There were patrons before us when we sat down and they were all still there. We were rushed. This place was not busy at all. Lots of empty tables and chairs.   Waitress never refilled our drinks. Bad customer service.  Will not be back.",

    "text": "During a weekend with the girls in charlotte, we found ourselves starving and craving breakfast at 2PM. Thanks to Yelp we found The Flying Biscuit Cafe and we agreed we had to go! We arrived to a packed house but the patio was open and there was a table wide open. We sat down quickly and we all had one thing on our mind... biscuits!  I wasn't long before our fabulous waitress Marissa eagerly greeted us. She put in our waters and coffee all around. Good friends, good weather, good waitress, we were definitely winning the day at this point.   I ordered the The High Flyer Breakfast. This was a huge meal and came with two eggs, chicken sausage (I got vegetarian!!), grits, and an oatmeal pancake with peaches... oh and a biscuit! I'm not kidding, this was so much freakin' food. While I tried, I did not succeed at cleaning my plate. I started with the biscuit and I must say, it was great. Fluffy, soft on the inside a little crust on the outside, everything you think of when you imagine a great biscuit. I added a little butter and this house made jam that was on the table. I always expect a lot out of a menu item that's I the name of the business and in this case, I approve! My eggs were also cooked perfectly, the vegetarian sausages were great, and I was surprised by the grits. I'm not a huge grits person but they were pretty damn tasty. I dove into the pancake last and I gotta say that I was not a fan. It was very tough and instead of enjoying it, I was caught red handed nibbling on my friend's original pancake. Now, that was a good pancake!   Overall, my party had a great time here and I would recommend it to anyone visiting or living near by. If you're lucky you'll snag Marissa as your waitress.!",

My main complaint is there was not a lot of variety in their menu. It's pretty much eggs, bacon or sausage, grits and pancakes. I wish there were more healthier options offered for people who don't want all those carbs.",

We started with the pimento cheese and oven fried green tomatoes, both were delicious. My main course I ordered the Shrimp scramble and added the jalapeno bacon mixed in with half grits and half potatoes for the side. The grits were just as I remembered and the potatoes were perfect. The jalapeno bacon was so good I was I just got it by itself because I was digging through the scramble for it. The scramble itself was okay but I wouldn't order it again the bacon did set it off though and gave it more favor. And it looked to be like 2 shrimp cut up inside of it. The service was fast and on point with making sure our drinks were full and we were doing alright.",

    "text": "This was my first time here, but definitely not my last!!!! Went there on a Sunday - so prime-time for brunch crowd. The wait for a table of two was not long. I don't even think it was 20mins.   Atmosphere: Very eclectic decor and fast pace. Lots of people talking, staff moving around. Quirky art-work on the walls. I like!  Food. Went there with a friend and we couldn't decide what to get for the longest time. Well, while waiting to be seated I had my mind set on something, which I totally didn't order.  I had the Biscuits, Eggs and Gravy. Oh boy! My friend raved about their homemade chicken sausage, but I was craving savory gravy at first didn't realize it had bits of chicken sausage in it until it came out....yes it does state on the menu *facepalm*. Total win, when my plate arrived! Those biscuits are worth all the hype! I was thinking of perhaps ordering a side to bring home, but nooo, got to lay low on the carbs! Maybe i'll bring some home now for thanksgiving :) I'm new to the world of \"Grits\", I liked their grits, wouldn't know what \"bad\" ones would taste like though.   I ordered water and coffee. The staff were attentive and refilled before I even noticed it was getting low. Plus points! Our waiter was super friendly and told us not to forget their homemade butter! Delish!  My friend ordered the Egg-stravaganza. My original pick was to try their french toast, but yah! didn't order, so my friend was nice enough to have me taste hers. The french toast topped with  homemade raspberry sauce and honey creme anglaise was good. They used whole-wheat toast. As a spoiled new yorker who loves diners, I was hoping for thick challah bread for the french-toast, but the whole wheat made this tasty dish sound healthy...even just a little.  Loved our whole brunch experience and will definitely come back! only star deduction because parking sucks a little - acknowledging it was brunch rush-hour, still...come early - park safer, none of those crazies that zoom through the lot.",

I like good food so I was game.  Cute place.  Nice atmosphere.  Larger enough to serve a good size crowd but still very quaint.  We were seated in a young ladies section named, Teala. The universe KNEW what it was doing when it connected our souls that morning.  Her personality was charming, caring and she was very helpful.  We tried the fried green tomatoes.  They were slightly different from the fried tomatoes that I was used to eating in my grandmother's kitchen. They had or were topped with like a walnut type of preserve and was also served with a dollop of goat cheese. Interesting... They weren't fried hard enough for me but, tasty just the same. We didn't finish because our breakfast had come. I order the chicken chorizo.  Unfortunately, there is NO picture because when my plate came, I dug in!  OH MY GOODNESS!  The flavors!  The potatoes and the veggies were crisp and the sausage was cooked and seasoned perfectly. One of the best Chorizo's I had eaten.  The mango mamosa's were an excellent addition to this breakfast.  I strongly urge you to sit through the alight wait and try this place out.  It is well worth your wait, your time and money.  Between the atmosphere, the servers and the food, you'll leave there full, satisfied and grateful.  Ask for Teala!  She will make your dining experience a 10!",

The restaurant is pretty cramped and while there is outdoor seating, it felt like it was understaffed. Rushing around and trying to keep up, created a very brisk and unfriendly service. As for the food, it was plain and predictable for a breakfast place. Nothing memorable and most disappointing of all, the biscuits were not that good. We have not gone back.",

I think they must get a lot of lunch traffic, but we were there on Friday for supper. Only half of my meal (a breakfast plate) was good--the grits were indeed creamy and delicious, but I suspect they had been microwaved, because there was a sticky film rimmed around the bowl. The pork bacon was crispy and not greasy. But my scrambled eggs were overcooked and rubbery, and the biscuit (the signature item) was the size, shape and consistency of a baseball. It was also cold. My companion had biscuit topped chicken pot pie, which was like chicken stew served on top of a biscuit, topped with a biscuit, and served with--you guessed it--a biscuit. The chicken filling had a good flavor with plenty of chicken and vegetables, but all the juice was absorbed into the dry biscuits. I would rather eat canned biscuits than the ones they serve. Very disappointing.",

I started off with a Large OJ ($2.99) and while the size wasn't what I expected, it did taste like fresh squeeze which is much better than paying the Gallon price for a cup of Minute Maid.  I ordered the sausage gravy, eggs and biscuits ($9.29). The grits are so good! Everything was packed with flavor.  My wife ordered the Turkey hash ($9.25). It was So delicious! The meat was so tender and packed with flavor. I asked for tomatillo sauce on side and it just boosted the delicious factor for me.  I would highly recommend you stop here for a few bites!",

We showed up at 9am and were easily able to get a table for 6.  I ordered the French Toast however, and it was ... different.  When I imagine French Toast, I think big, fluffy, flavorful bread with some hints of cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg.  The French Toast that I got was soggy wheat bread with some delicious raspberry glaze over it - which was the saving grace.  Without the raspberry sauce,  I would have been a very unhappy camper.    When we left around 10am, there was a long line and they won't sit you unless your entire party is there.  I'm not sure that I'll be back anytime soon - too many other breakfast/brunch places to try.",

Guillermo was working the bar like a top notch pro, and everyone was quickly tended to. My food was served in under 10 minutes. 3 eggs, shrimp, feta, turkey bacon, tomatoes, some kind of awesome salsa; yeah, this breakfast was the bomb.   Creamy dreamy grits and a biscuit are standard sides, but buy an extra dozen to take home for breakfast the next day. Apple butter in squeeze bottles on the bar...eat that stuff with a spoon if I had to.   If you are within 10 miles of this place and need breakfast, drive past the IHOP's and Denny's, and cruise on into the Flying Biscuit. Lots of parking, great atmosphere, attentive and well trained staff, oh....and the food is all that and then some.",

Once we started eating we were left disappointed by how bland the food was.The bacon reminded me of bacon at a hospital cafeteria and the grits were ok at best.His French toast was two very,very thin and extremely soggy pieces of toast with raspberry sauce drizzled on top.The eggs were also tasteless.Oh,and our waiter never checked in with us once our food arrived at our table.My fiance said theirs better breakfast at McDonald's.I know it's hard to believe that last statement but honestly,this place is nothing special.What a waste of time and money..  If you want a good plate of food,go elsewhere.I only give this place one star because the biscuit was pretty good.However,we won't be visiting again.",

I used to  love them, or maybe I was just ignorant of all the other yummy places around but this last visit was majorly disappointing.  The biscuits are still pretty good...not served as warm and they were a little more dry.  My go-to meal is the organic oatmeal pancakes with peaches.  This past time they were dry, almost overcooked and bland.    The eggs were okay but not fluffy, the chicken sausage was greasy and chewy, the fruit was primarily honey dew, etc etc.  I could go on and on.    The service was okay but honestly, not super efficient or friendly.  They were packed on Saturday and they are in a great location but I'm over them.  I just don't think the quality is that great.  Too many other spots popping up around town.",

This location on Park Road is, in my opinion, even better than the originals in Atlanta (perhaps I am simply desperate for a good Flying Biscuit here).  Great biscuits and gravy, super omelets.  Very easygoing host and waitresses.  These days, one of my primary considerations is whether the place is kid friendly.  This Flying Biscuit is very good with kids.  And you can take them to Park Road Books after you eat to let them pick out a book.  However, keep in mind that the wait can be long at peak breakfast time.  So if you have kids, come early!  (Or there are other breakfast places in this strip mall, like Cafe Charlotte - not that great but will do if your kids are freaking out and the line here is too long - or Caribou - at least you can get a coffee and some juice for your kids).",

    "text": "Flying Biscuit.  Not fast enough.  We arrived peak hours, on a Sunday afternoon, with a party of about 10.  We were seated pretty quickly, considering the crowd loitering around outside and our size.  But our service was less than par.  We had at least three of the managers come serve us our beverages, while we baked in the heat of the sun (although we did request an outside seat).  And our server took too long, to take our drink orders and then to take our food orders.  Other than service, the food was delicious.  I was thoroughly surprised by the sweet biscuits.  And then, topped with chicken sausage gravy, this added a completely new spin on the meaning of biscuits and gravy.  Not my favorite, but definitely interesting.  And the best of all, those creamy, dreamy grits!  Who can forget such a delectable treat!  Although, they said there was cheese mixed in, it was not nearly enough for my satisfaction.  Definitely will be a repeat, unless the service continues to be slower than molasses.",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE this place.  This has probably been my 10th time eating at the Flying Biscuit.  The first one I ever went to was in Atlanta in Midtown.  I'm glad they branched out to Charlotte a few years back.  I seriously can't find anything I don't like on the menu.  The Roasted Hummus Wrap is to die for.  You also get those \"moon-dusted\" potatoes as your side with that yummy fresh Biscuit and that apple butter.  YUM.  On this recent visit I got the Veggie Omelette with a side of fruit, and of course the yummy biscuit. The Flying Biscuit is very different than other restaurants and has its own distinct feel.  This location on Park Rd is my favorite because it is a Huge Space.  The other Flying Biscuit locations are very small, and when there busy (which tends to be often) you usually have to wait forever to get seated.  The Park Rd location also has a huge patio in the back, and also a small patio in the front for extra seating when its warm.  If you haven't ate at the Flying Biscuit I definitely recommend going.  You won't regret it.",

It was a crazy mix of penne pasta, cooked fresh spinach, cheese and spicy sausage - SOOOO GOOD!!!  Came with huge biscuit with applebutter and fab grits.  We shared and were charged a small splitting fee (I think it was two dollars) and they gave us an extra biscuit so we didnt have to split that.  More than enough food - we could barely finish our meals.  The waitstaff is young and unattentive (had to ask for refills on coffee and the check).  But the food is worth it!!!",

    "text": "I created this account to post my first ever Yelp review because that's how good The Flying Biscuit is! A friend and I were hungry and trying to decide what to have for lunch today. On a whim, we stumbled across The Flying Biscuit. It was almost empty aside from a handful of customers. I knew right away just from the eclectic decor that we were in for a treat. Our server's name was Claudia. She was very nice and friendly and had our orders out in less than ten minutes. Granted, we went early on a Friday afternoon but for what it's worth, our food was so good I wouldn't have minded having to wait during their busy hours. My friend ordered the Turkey Hash and I ordered Pasta, Sausage and Eggs. We fell in love with our food! Rarely am I ever able to find a place on my very first visit where everything is delicious. The portions are more than generous and reasonably priced. We both took home half of everything. I tried some of her hash. The turkey was tender and perfectly seasoned. I've already decided it's what I'm going to order on my next visit. I was initially wary of a dish that mixes penne pasta and scrambled eggs but oddly enough, the combination works. The flavors of the spinach and chicken sausage and cheese and mushrooms were well-balanced to where not one ingredient overpowered the others. But far and away the best part of my meal: the creamy dreamy grits. Oh my gosh the grits! I'm not exaggerating when I say they are THE best grits I've ever had in my entire life. They're like crack in a bowl! I don't eat grits that often but when I do order them, I usually have to add salt, pepper, and butter to taste. Not this time. They were incredible! It would be worth it just to order a big bowl of creamy dreamy grits. They were so smooth and they melt in your mouth. One other component of the meal: the biscuits of course were great...light and fluffy. I'm convinced they've kidnapped someone's grandmother and is holding her hostage in the kitchen and the only thing she's allowed to do is make biscuits all day. Claudia directed us to a squeeze bottle of apple butter on our table for our biscuits. I usually cannot stand apple butter. It's gross and I hate the taste of it. I feel like something with the word apple in the name should at least taste like apples. I guess because everything else was so delicious, I thought \"Why not?\" and decided to try it anyway. I can now say the only apple butter I will ever eat is The Flying Biscuit's. I got a small cup of it to go with the other half of my biscuit that I took home. I love going to restaurants with inventive menus that don't serve the typical fare that you can get anywhere else. The Flying Biscuit is now one of my new favorite places to eat, hands down. I can't wait to go back!",

If you like your biscuits really really dense with sugar on top and chicken gravy spread over them then you'll enjoy this oxymoron mix. Have never experienced in the south such a mixture of sugar and gravy. The chicken gravy was delicious but wasted on those biscuits. Also pay CLOSE attention to descriptions of their food. When they state creamy dreamy grits they really meant cream of wheat. So NOT southern. Guess their overall national success is based on the claim of southern and not the reality.   Service was good and friendly. No wait on a Friday evening. Eclectic environment. Prices are reasonable based on serving size if you enjoy their idea of southern.   Overall ashamed that people from other areas of the nation will consider this menu southern.  Before submitting this review did some research and found that Delia Champion founder and creator of those recipes grew up in New Jersey. If you want to try authentic southern food, visit Jestine's Kitchen in Charleston. So good there are no words.",

Whether you are interested in breakfast, lunch, dinner, girl's night, or date night - the Flying B is your place!  The food is different and delicious.  It's got that home-style feel with a funky twist.    Mind Blowers: * Anything with the word BLT in it. * Fried Green Tomatoes with Goat Cheese * Brie * The Veggie Scramble * The Sausage Gravy - get it.  Don't ask questions * orange-infused whole wheat French toast * Grits (I've heard people would give up their children for the Flying B's grits!) * ....and pretty much everything else  Other Important pieces of Information: * The staff rocks * Yes, they have a full espresso bar for you coffee addicts, nom nom nom * Yes, they serve alcohol * Yes, they have wireless * This place is a zoo on the weekends.  If you are planning on going for breakfast on Saturday or Sunday get there in time to wait for 10-20 minutes.  Don't be put off by the line outside, it moves fast! * The Flying B is family friendly - so if babies or children freak you out, better find somewhere else to eat (On that note, babies and children freak me out and I still go here as much as humanly possible).  Point being - if you live in Charlotte and you don't go to Flying Biscuit you probably aren't an American.",

The grits are better than my mama's and those three cheese Quaker grits that got me through college. Excellent food, excellent service, and excellent music in the background - nothing like Hall and Oates to start the day. Make this a to-do if you have yet to visit",

    "text": "This Flying Biscuit was a bit difficult for our group to find in the shopping center.  When we arrived we saw that there was already a line outside.  Luckily we were able to bypass the waste by sitting at the little (coffee) bar that they have.  My friends said that they had great coffee but that may have just been the hangover talking.  I ordered the Cajun Chicken Scramble with an extra couple of their famous biscuits.  The scramble had egg, cajun-seasoned chicken, goat cheese, onions, and sun dried tomatoes with a warm cajun tomato sauce.  It was ok.  With all of those good flavorful ingredients I expected a LOT more flavor.  There was very little goat cheese mixed in and those bites were my favorite.  It didn't help that I feel like my order was sitting in \"the window\" for a few minutes too long.  The biscuits are very good.  BIG.  Fluffy on the inside with a nice outer crust.  I really liked the cranberry apple spread.  It had an excellent bite and wasn't super sweet.  Our sever was very pleasant and took very good care of us.  The inside of the restaurant is so bright and has a cheery feeling that was perfect on our raining Monday morning.  The service, the biscuits, and the ambiance got Flying Biscuit to 3 stars because my entree was just really disappointing.",

My girlfriend went to Florida for law school and told me that I HAD to go to one of these places. My goodness it was good. A great way to say: WELCOME TO THE SOUTH (I know NC is a debatable southern state, but this restaurant surely is).  I got the one with sausage biscuit, layered over by scrambled eggs and grits on the side. I never had grits before and it took some \"acquiring\" to do for me to enjoy it. BUT man the sausage biscuit with the scrambled eggs on top is something to DIEEEEE FORRRR! I don't think I need to do any explaining but, to say to go get it, and get fat, like a True Southerner.  Nothing up north has something like this. I want it now.",

This was our first visit, based on a friend's recommendation, and we really liked the diverse choices on the breakfast menu. Eggs were cooked perfectly, I loved the moon dusted potatoes which I substituted for the creamy dreamy grits. My hubby had those and said they were as heavenly as described. I really enjoyed the eggs over black bean cakes with feta, tomatillo and sour cream. Would def order that again! Coffee was hot, fresh and good. Love the funky decor, it seemed like a popular local hangout. So...the biscuits? Well, we love us some good southern biscuits, and for a place with biscuit in the name, we were just disappointed. They were kinda sweet, and a little dry. Don't let that stop you though, overall a great breakfast find.",

The place was very busy, and we waited about 20 minutes or so for a table which we knew would be the case anywhere at that time of day. The only downside is all those waiting for a table need to wait outside--a huge drag when it's chilly.  This place gives you a lot of food for a very reasonable price. I had the Southern Eggs Benedict, an item that was recently added to the menu (their online menu has yet to be updated to include all the new items). My food was delicious! I could barely finish it, there was so much of it, but it all tasted wonderful. I was disappointed, however, that my poached eggs were almost entirely cooked all the way through, with the yolk not having the slightest bit of run to it. Disappointing, but the food was still good overall, and our server was very nice and attentive in spite of how busy it was.  I'll definitely be going back for brunch again soon.",

Here is were the problem started.....my husband had watery grits, and sent them back, the 2nd bowl came out even more watery.  When the check came he asked them to remove the grits.  Well a few minutes later here comes the MOST RUDEST MANAGER EVER!!!!She proceeds to ask my husband \"What happened to the grits.\" My husband explained in a very nice way, that the grits were watery.  Erin the manager, starts to tell us there is no way those grits came out of there kitchen like that, and proceeds to tell us that he poured water into the grits.  My niece and husband explained again, that they came out this way, and furthermore what satisfaction would we get out of pouring water in grits.  She goes in on my husband, and he went back in on her, and things got WAY out of line, all over GRITS, AND her poor way of handling this.  I have worked in Customer Service, and the resturant business, for over 20 years, if she was a Manager at my store, she would be FIRED ASAP.  Lucky you don't work for me.

As we waited for our food I think our server refilled our coffee once and we had to ask for silverware after our food came. That's such a pet peeve of mine. Anyways I think they forgot to cook my meal fully because I had shredded cheese on my eggs and it was still shredded. It was not cooked. I was starving so I just ate it. The food was cold and the biscuit, which I was most excited for, was over cooked and hard. Plus we had to track our server down to get or check.   I would love to give the flying biscuit another try, but my first time left a bad taste in my mouth...",

Turkey with gravy on top of roasted potatoes and topped with an over medium egg and melted cheese. Our food came out piping hot, and so was the coffee. The turkey hash looked so delicious when it came out that I accidentally cut into it before snapping a picture! I was ready to dig in, and ended up stuffing my face! The biscuit with apple butter is one of my favorite things about the Flying Biscuit, it is definitely one of their staples. Everything comes out tasting homemade and fresh.   Staff is always friendly and service is on point. There is usually a wait here on the weekends during breakfast hours, so we like to go around lunchtime. I also recommend one of the many flavored mimosas and the espresso shot.   ***UPDATE*** I had this place at 5 stars, but had to drop them to 4 when I've recently had poor service here. The last time I went for a late lunch, my server wasn't helpful with the menu at all, acted as if we were taking up too much of her time, and never got a coffee or water refill for the whole sitting.",

Since this summer, we have eaten here four or more times, and actually prefer this location over Atlanta's.  Despite the distance from our house, FBC is now on our regular rotation for Saturday breakfast!  We've tried a few different menu items -  Biscuit, Eggs, and Gravy, Egg-Ceptional Eggs, Flatiron Steak and Eggs, and Meggxican Wrap.  The biscuit and chicken sausage gravy is my favorite, and they will gladly add cheese to the scrambled eggs upon request.  I can never finish the plate, the portion is so large!  Their grits are also fantastic, and I can always find room to finish those!  We only wish the black bean cakes in the Egg-Ceptional eggs were made a little thinner and crispier.  (I'm thinking of West Egg's black bean cakes in ATL as a point of comparison.)  Their Flatiron Steak and Eggs is very good, and one of my husband's favorites, along with the spicy Meggxican Wrap.     Service is always friendly and extremely fast.  The interior is larger than it appears, and we've always been seated quickly.  FBC has two patios - one in front facing the parking lot, and one larger one in the back (facing the quieter back parking area).  The back patio is larger and more comfortable...IF you can get a seat that's not in the direct sun.  They really need to install an awning to protect the outer tables from direct sunlight!  I appreciate that FB offers espresso drinks.  While expensive, their cappuccinos and lattes are pretty good.    If you haven't tried Flying Biscuit, you should!",

Black bean cakes topped with salsa verde, feta and sour cream (plus onions but I nixed those). It was a really flavorful dish. I switched out my salad for collard greens. They were good too. My friend really liked her BBQ chicken burrito and soup. It's a cute little place and our server was very sweet. I need to go back for brunch!",

Kudos to Markisha for her joy of life, and to Bob (the host outside with the mustache) for his happiness even when slammed.  I know others might ding them on certain entrees, which I cannot comment since I eat only breakfast here, but the variety of their morning menu has never let me down.  Should I get the Southern Scramble, or the Smoked Salmon scramble, or The Piedmont omelet?  Hmmmm.  They're all so good.",

I tried something different for me, the southern scramble, it was awesome!! Eggs, onions, greens, ham I think, and cheese. Yummy! My daughter had the biscuits and gravy. She really like it, but beware it is a large portion. I tasted her biscuits and gravy also and really loved the gravy. Super tasty. The only thing that I was not crazy about, and this is strictly a preference, the biscuits were very thick and heavy. I like mine light and fluffy. But the apple butter they have sitting on the table, fantastic! One other note, the shopping center is very busy, so you may have to park far in the parking lot. But well worth it.",

My friend and I stopped in for a late brunch Sunday afternoon, we had a small wait for a table but I got VIP parking right on front of the restaurant so we just chatted and waited in the car until they called us in.   Not long after we were seated our waiter arrived, very pleasant smile and attitude it was like we were old friends. He took our drink orders and offered tons of suggestions. Based on previous reviews, I already knew what I wanted to try...the Pasta, Sausage, and Eggs which is three eggs with chicken sausage, penne pasta, spinach, and cheese...(thanks JJ! ) I decided to skip the mushrooms this visit but they normally come with this dish as well.  As I my side I decided to change the grits for the hash browns. My friend ordered the salmon scramble with grits and a side of bacon.  Even though, it was packed it took no time me my food was awesome!!!!   My food was delicious!!! The mix of pasta, chicken sausage and eggs was so unique I just loved it! Just an overall hearty and tasty dish. The hash browns were very tasty but my friend let me try her grits and I could have kicked myself for not ordering them!!! They really were creamy and dreamy!!! Sooo much better than I expected. I tried to keep my spoon out of her dish but I couldn't...next time TRUST that I will be getting the grits!!!  Fabulous meal, great service and just overall excellent experience! Loved it and can't wait to come back!!!",

My husband loves the crunchy outside and I am a big fan of the gooey middle and this one does both. They had a cranberry apple butter sauce in a squeeze bottle on the table that was pretty good with the biscuit. Just a note, this biscuit is on the sweet side if you like more savory biscuits probably will not be for you.   I ordered the EGG-STRAORDINARY BREAKFAST - two eggs, creamy dreamy grits and oven-roasted \"moon dusted\" potatoes. Got my eggs over-hard so nothing special. I have never been a big fan of grits, but these were to die for.  No idea if they are good or not, but for me the first time I could eat a whole bowl of grits. No clue what made them so yummy to me, but I was blown away. Now the \"moon dusted\" potatoes on the other hand were also nothing special. I am guessing the \"moon dust\" is extra salt because they were super salty and I should have requested no dust for me.  Live and Learn.  My dining partner got the OVEN FRIED GREEN TOMATO BLT and it looked pretty good also, big portions, colorful. The whole wheat bun looked amazing.  I would highly recommend this place to people. I have heard it gets insane on the weekend, so we went early lunch time on a Friday. We got a table right away and our food came out quickly.",

Filled with lots of yummy options! I love a menu with lots of choices! Pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes were our appetizers and they did not upset. Somehow I went my whole life with trying fried green tomatoes and now I'm craving Flying Biscuit's tomatoes!  For my main dish I ordered the Cajun chicken scramble. Mmmm it was so good with the right amount of spice! Ofcourse i had their famous grits and it did not disappoint, creamy and made perfectly.  Can't wait to come back to try some dinner items!",

But I will say he did give everything that was asked for. The food was satisfying everything was hot when it came out, but with everything I had I was not completely full once I was done. One thing I did notice was the employees were having their break and were eating where the customers could see them.  Now mind you they are fine to eating but if you are on your break the customers should not see you while your on your break.  I even saw one of the employees walked up to a table she was waiting on with her drinking glass in her hand....it was not for anyone at her table.  I am all about great customer service so that everyone  has a great experience and cant wait to come back.",

    "text": "First time and we will be back  This has been one of those places that I wanted to visit for a number of years because of the name, my wife thought it served only biscuits. Finally got her to take a look at a very large and eclectic menu and she changed here mind.  Drove down from Cornelius this morning which was a rather cool April Sunday Morning.  Arrived around 11:45am and there was a line but we were told that the wait was only about 15 minutes which proved to be fairly correct.  Granted it was chilly and was still in the high 30's the wait was tolerable.  Looking around while we waited, we could tell that this place was dog friendly because of the number of water bowls around. I would assume that if you have a dog, you can sit at one of the sidewalk tables with your furry friend. A bit cool for that today.  Our name was called and we were promptly seated.  First order of business was two cups of coffee, as much to wrap our hands around as to sip. Coffee was of excellent quality and nice and robust and served to warm up both inside and out.  While we waited, my wife went ahead and ordered a Coffee White Russian and while I may be missing something, a Black Russian is made with Kahlua which is a Coffee Liqueur so what's the difference. In any case, she enjoyed it and that is all that matters.  For her entree, she ordered the Turkey Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans and a Rolls. For my entree, I ordered the 3B ( Bacon, Basil and Bleu Cheese) on a grilled Chicken Breast , Bread, Romaine and Tomato.  Both proved to be excellent choices, The server gave me option of regular bacon as opposed to the turkey bacon which is standard on this sandwich which I did.  All in all, the food was outstanding and there are many more items on this rather creative menu I wish to explore at a later visit.  Service is very good and the decor is very light and reminiscent of Haight Asbury from the 60's.  Love the decor.  We will definitely be back. A bit cool today and they do have a rear patio with gas heaters but still a bit warmer on the inside.",

We were able to get a booth for 2 right away. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. From the host that sat us, to our server, and even the manager Shane.   The menu had so many great choices on it that my friend and I were a little slow in making a decision on our entrees. Our server was sooooo patient with us. Always smiling and willing to come back in five more minutes. While we were narrowing down our choices Shane (the manager) came to our table to check on us and answer any questions about the menu. We explained we were visiting from out of state and that it was our first time here. He gave us some great recommendations and hooked us up with two of their famous biscuits. The sauce that was on the table to use on the biscuit was absolutely amazing. It made the perfect combination and I love how fresh both the biscuit and the sauce were.   We ordered our entrees and mimosas. Everything was delicious and of course I had a second biscuit with my meal. I ate the wheat pancake with peaches and the fried mac and cheese. Everything we ordered was extra tasty and filling. The atmosphere of the cafe was friendly and inviting. I really enjoyed our experience here. I would highly recommend trying this place and I'll definately be returning to eat here next time im in charlotte.",

    "text": "Flying Biscuit came highly recommended to me by a friend, so after a weekend in Charlotte we stopped in for brunch on our way home. This place is delicious and they have an awesome menu. My only complaint would be the space. We sat outside and the tables are so close together it's hard to navigate. The food truly made up for it though. Some of the best grits around! I had the southern Benedict which was a biscuit topped with pimento cheese, bacon, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. It was delicious and plated nicely. If I had to recommend one thing at Flying Biscuit it would hands down be the grits. This place is definitely worth a visit and it would be nice to see them expand to a bigger, better location!",

    "text": "\"Oooooo, I wanna come back,\" I said to myself as I read through the menu. There was so much good-sounding stuff I wanted to try, and I felt away about not being able to sample it this one time.   Nevertheless, I settled on the Hollywood omelet. This healthier option is a veggie omelet with cheese. It comes with fruit (but I substituted the fruit for grits) and a biscuit. I also ordered the 'creamiest dreamiest grits'.  The omelet was rather large, I couldn't finish it all. It was a little watery, but I blame the spinach inside of it. It wasn't bad , at all and the tomato coulis went VERY well with the omelet...I kind of want that on all my omelets now.  The grits were creamy, delicious, and maybe had a little bit of cheese mixed in, which was good. I wish the portion of grits was bigger. The biscuit was good as well, it was definitely fluffy. Not the greasy, super salty Bojangles biscuit that leaves your fingertips glistening. These are drier, for lack of a better term and I was getting a flour-like aftertaste...and yet it didn't stop me from spreading the signature cranberry apple butter on top and eating it.   Very much looking forward to coming and back and trying the dishes with chicken sausage, and maybe some of the French toast.",

The apple butter that came with it was unremarkable.  My oven fried chicken was dry.  My mac and cheese kinda tasted like it came from a cafeteria and the collards were tasteless.  My friend's shrimp and grits were okay but can't say she finished much of her plate.  Must say, I've had much better brunch!",

    "text": "I do think Flying Biscuit is a bit expensive, but they serve mostly organic and gluten free products.  So in that sense, its a steal. I would rather pay more for simple ingredients.  Their portions are also huge! So you can get the High Flyer for 6 or 8 bucks- but split it with someone else.   Being from Wilmington, NC- Breakfast places are a staple.  It has been hard to find good eclectic breakfast places in Charlotte.  So if that is what you're looking for, come here!  I've been for both breakfast and dinner and out of all the times I have been here, not once have I been disappointed.",

    "text": "Visited for the first time last Sunday with one of my Brunch Buddies.  The place was a little hard to find, tucked away in a big shopping center, but the long line of people waiting outside clued me in.  The line moved quickly though, and my friend and I had a table within 15 minutes.  My only real complaint was the table we were seated at.  They have a huge back patio that I am sure is amazing when the weather is nice, but that day it was rainy and chilly.  My chair was right next to the back rail of the patio and the plastic wall cover thingy didn't do the best job of keeping the cold wind and rain out.  The food, however, was amazing and the waitress was very friendly and attentive.  The salmon scramble and rosemary potatoes are to die for!  Despite being a GRIT, I have never cared much for grits, but I may have to rethink that.  Definitely going back!",

The place looks like someone couldn't decide on a color scheme and just mash in as many colors that would fit into a space.     I only tried the shrimp and grits, and biscuits with apple cranberry butter. On the first spoon of grits I was in love, such creamy grits with a perfect amount of seasoning! As for the biscuit I was not much of a fan as it was very hard and unappetizing. I ended up using it to scoop up the delicious apple cranberry butter.     Hopefully next time I try this place the biscuits will be better, which they should be since they're in the name.",

I was kind of overwhelmed with all the options, so I just chose this: Vegan BBQ Burrito: BBQ tofu, collard greens, and mushrooms folded in a sun-dried tomato tortilla topped with salsa verde (for those not so vegan, sour cream available upon request). This was good, but dang, it was really spicy. I could barely eat it, it was so spicy. I got my 2 year old some fried mac-n-cheese, but she was in a bad mood and wouldn't eat it. I tried it, and it was good! I have to say, though, for a place that has \"biscuit\" in their name, the biscuit I tried was not that good. I would give this place another try, though.",

My biggest complaint about the place is that their biscuits really aren't anything special. Hard to believe at a place with biscuit in their name, right?!   I usually order a scramble of some sort. The veggie one is good and fresh, wanting for a little bit of seasoning. I've tried the turkey bacon and grits on different visits. Both were just ok.   If you don't get there before 9:30am on the weekend, expect to wait. The guy at the front (if you've been there, you know the one... with the awesome mustache) is always nice, welcoming you, opening the door for everyone, etc. I like that they have a huge space heater outside for the wait in winter months.   Service is very hit or miss. We've had super attentive servers on some visits and literally had to hunt someone down to pay on others.   Overall, a good, (usually) quick spot for a fresh breakfast but still working on consistency, I think.",

We were initial almost discourage with the huge line outside but this was even more of a reason to give it a try (long line, must be good).  We were greet in a timely manner by nice gentleman. We waited roughly 15 to maybe 20 mins but boy wasn't the wait worth it.   Let's dive into the grub aka food (overall delicious). I ordered the southern scramble that consisted of all the mouth watering southern food (collard, applewood bacon, grits). The eggs were hands down amazing (fluffy, light and creamy). The collards and the bacon were a perfect match. The only thing that I would change were the onions that were a bit raw. However, this is not the best part yet!!  The grits!! (Creamy, buttery, smooth, and just simply mouth watering). The real MVP of this place were the grits.   The biscuits were good but really didn't see what all the hype was to be honest. They were a bit in the dry side but still good. Not taking anything away from this place.   (Maybe I was just blown away by the grits.)!!  Oh, let's not forget my wife food was amazing from what I gather from her empty plates. My wife ordered the meggixcan wrap which she loved.   The service was good, Claudia was quick and attentive. She was pretty busy but go figure right ? Amazing food equals busy place  Loved it.",

I requested a cup of joe and a water. After tussling with sugar packets ( I despise sugar packets. Get sugar dispensers already.)   I ordered the shrimp and grits. It was ok. The shrimp were cooked just right and the grits were tasty and creamy but the chunks of tomato I can do without. I think Midnight Diner has spoiled me with their shrimp and grits. Along with my fish there was a biscuit. A HARD biscuit. I started to ask for butter but in this case it wouldn't have helped. I slathered the jam that was provided inside the biscuit. Honestly, I wouldn't sell biscuits that hard. Biscuits should be soft and WARM....  Anywho, I'd give The Flying Biscuit another try minus the biscuit.",

The way you make scrambled eggs should be the same you'd make scrambled tofu - it's simple! You can have peppers, mushrooms, spinach and add some spices that make sense (why are you adding soy sauce?!) - a little oil, turmeric (for a nice yellow and not brown color), salt, pepper, chili powder, garlic, maybe some cumin or oregano to taste. The texture was ok, but because there was so much soy sauce it was unnecessarily runny. The biscuit it came with was good and service was quick. I would not try their tofu scramble again.",

It is a new wave cool \"light\" approach to Southern basics.  Out with the pork. In with the chicken and turkey.  More salads. Cappucino if you want it.  But this is still Southern food, through and through.   Everything comes with a biscuit, and it is one big fat filling biscuit.  You will waddle out of there just from the biscuit, never mind the ton of other stuff that is on your plate.  It is not my favorite biscuit on the planet - but it is in the top half definitely.  Crumbles more than I like, and not meant to have that much taste.  (It is for your gravy, your poached egg or for the apple butter that is on every table).  I scarfed mine down plenty fast, so my objections could not have been that serious.  My main dish was a fried egg salad.  (Yup, this is the new light cuisine, not Grama's southern).  The salad had two huge slices of turkey bacon, two fried eggs, moondusted potatoes, chipotle aioli AND balsamic vinaigrette on my greens.  Salad? You betcha. Italian supermodel wisp food? No way!  I loved the combo.   Fried egg salads? Their time has come. You can give those to me anytime.  The ingredients themselves? They ranged from A to B+.  Turkey bacon may be lighter than bacon bacon - but this is North Carolina.  Legendary food comes from pigs. It does not come from turkeys.  Moondusted potatoes were pleasant and there was some sort of spice to them. I am still not sure what moondust is, but the sauteing was nice.  The fried eggs? Perfect for a salad. Stayed firm on top of the salad but the yolk covered all the salad leaves nicely. Thumbs up here.  My wife's salmon and eggs were perfectly fine.  This place is not for vegans or for people trying to lose weight.  Everything has cheese, or butter, or gravy with milk.  Servings are massive; food is hearty.  Chicken sausage is still sausage   (and if you are doing sausage anyway, pork sausage is oh-so-good).  But I rolled out of Flying Biscuit pretty happy.  I was too full to walk, so my wife had to roll me out like a barrel.  (Okay, I just lied, but I was both full - and full of calories - no doubt about that.)  When I am back in Carolina, I will continue my search for the perfect breakfast -   and the perfect biscuit.   That breakfast will involve actual pork, no question on that front.  But I would not object to another meal or six at the Flying Biscuit.  The place has its charms.",

After all of the stellar reviews I have read, I have to say I was a little underwhelmed and slightly disappointed at my experience.  It was definitely busy, but I did not have to wait for a table as it sounds like it's much busier on the weekends then during the week.    The service was not great by any means, as it took at least 10 minutes for someone to even notice I had sat down and was waiting for any kind of service... a water and wait would have been fine, but not so much the case.  Once I finally got someone's attention to come to my table, I went ahead and ordered drinks and food as I didn't want to be sitting there who knows how long till they came back.  My food did come quickly, but my table didn't have butter or jam like every other table did so it took me a good 5 minutes to get someone's attention to tell them, the lady looked at me and said ok (fairly annoyed)... she never came back.  She actually went behind the bar area and started talking to another waiter.  I got so annoyed that I got up and walked to a table several tables away and snagged some jam and butter off of there.  To be honest if this review was based off of service they would get a one star.  Ok enough about the service you're really worried about the food, so here. we. go.... I went with the traditional flying biscuit breakfast (I think it's the first choice on the menu). Eggs, sausage, grits and biscuit.  Eggs were made as requested and hot when they came out. The chicken sausage was ok, it was in patty form and was a bit chewy. The biscuit was more on the sweet side with the colored sugar sprinkled on top. I'm more a fan of the savory/buttery biscuits, opposed to sweet ones; however with that being said it was perfectly baked, the texture, the flakey layers, etc... it was baked to perfection, I will give them that! Finally the cheesy grits that are a big ta da around these parts... they were very yummy, I enjoyed them. Can't say they were my favorite but I can see why people enjoy them. Overall I'm going to say it was just OK.  I liked the atmosphere good music and open floor space brought a lively feel to the restaurant.  Seemed like there was some limited but additional seating towards the back.  There is a bar so you can enjoy your adult beverages for brunch with your meal!  They had so many other options, like scrambles and such that were pretty unique so I think I'll go a little more off the beaten path next time I come back on the food side!",

Both dishes came out pretty quickly to my surprise. I was a little disappointed with my food though. I have heard so many good things about The Flying Biscuit. I guess they cook the Turkey bacon with the eggs?( I have never seen that technique before). Normally the ingredients are stuffed inside of the egg... I believe because of the fact that they were trying to cook the turkey bacon thoroughly it over cooked my eggs. My eggs were definitely well done and brown all over. There moon dusted potatoes were ok. The service was awesome though.",

Not only is the dining area welcoming with it's bright colors and natural light, the staff are extremely friendly, making you feel genuinely happy to be there.  I guess I should get to the most important part, right? THE FOOD! Surprise, surprise... IT'S AWESOME! If I can remember correctly, I ordered the vegetarian sausage, eggs and a biscuit with a side of fresh fruit. Also no surprise was that the biscuit was one of the best I have ever had. SO FLUFFY!   Overall, I had an awesome experience at The Flying Biscuit Cafe! Cool name, great food, friendly staff and great dining area. What more can I ask for?",

I had a side of moon dusted potatoes and they were delicious, not greasy or heavy on the stomach. I tried my boyfriends southern Benedict sandwich and it was very flavorful. The grits were delicious and creamy, almost like my grandmother used to make, southern style and such. They definitely didn't clump up and get nasty like most grits do. Also, the flying biscuits are amazing!!! They have some sort of sugar on top and it makes them irresistible. Definitely will come back for the awesome monthly specials and the drink menu!!!",

I asked for all my order to be separated out as I was driving a little ways IE. The gravy not on the biscuits so that they would still have some crunch and structure to them and that was not done.  I came home starving to eat them and it was a hot mess well not hot at all it was just a glob of cold mushy biscuits and gravy.  My meal was a bit bland, not tasting particularly good and was not sure what all the fuss was about.  I am sure that if I had stayed to have fresh food most likely would have been a better meal I will of course give them that, but I was not impressed.  Being in the food industry no matter how busy you are just READ THE TICKET and do as you promised to do.  They could have said no we have this procedure and then it was up to me.  Also no napkins or utensils just a bunch of mush in clamshell containers.  I had never had Grits and I must say that I did really enjoy the creamy grits they were very good and I was able to salvage them from the messy meal.  I will try again and come in to dine down the road but not rushing back.",

Despite the crowd and 30-minute wait, our food arrived fast and hot, and our server could not have been more pleasant.  I went with the Love Cakes and killer Fried Mac & Cheese. Both were delicious. The love cakes are were black bean based, and the fried mac and cheese is uniquely baked meatloaf style and sliced before pan frying. The rest of our party all ordered breakfast. The Creamy Dreamy Grits were indeed creamy and dreamy, and I am a self-proclaimed \"grits snob\". The eggs and bacon were also nicely prepared.  Amazingly, the one menu item that I liked the least (and this is True of the other location also) is the biscuits themselves. Instead of fluffy, as advertised, I have always found them to be extremely dry on the outside and a bit doughy on the inside. Few seem to share my opinion, however, so find out for yourself. After being raised on the farm, where my grandmother rolled fresh biscuits daily,  I might also just be a \"biscuit snob\" too.  Overall though, I love the whimsically casual vibe here, its unique menu selections, the warm and friendly service and, last but certainly not least, the 99 sanitation score. They also offer BOGO coupons in the Go-Play-Save books. I'll be back.",

    "text": "I have two words for you brunch fanatics:   COMFORT.   FOOD.   It's easy to miss this little restaurant lodged smack in the middle of the Park Road shopping center. This place is family friendly and there is plenty of parking, so grab the whole family and come HUNGRY. The menu consists of southern cooking, major comfort foods and brunch favorites like grits, eggs, biscuits and very, very delicious passion fruit mimosas.   I stopped in with some friends for Sunday afternoon brunch. Nothing fancy or extra special here, plain and simple: this place serves up GOOD food and decently priced. I tried the Shrimp and Grits, also the Chorizo Chicken - both were really good. TRY THE PASSION-FRUIT mimosas, they were my absolute favorite. I struggled to finish my meal because the portions are hefty. Their biscuits are definitely made in house - so that was really nice. They have a apple/cinnamon based sauce for the biscuits that I've never tried before, very sweet but good.   I wasn't very impressed with the service, I think our waitress might've been extra busy and stressed out - we got that vibe from her. Thankfully all our meals came out hot, and we were able to just eat everything and didn't need her help much. This place can pack in quite a crowd on weekends so be mindful of busy times.   Overall, this is a GREAT place for brunch if you just want to sit down and eat GOOD FOOD, some brunch places are more about the actual experience and ambiance versus the food. Not here. If you are feeling for some southern style, grandma's best recipes = try out the Flying Biscuit. My tummy was very pleased.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this visit. We went in a Monday morning.. and it was freezing outside..what better way to enjoy a frosty Monday am, than a good breakfast and a cup of coffee. I found the flying biscuit and was excited to eat here , as I've seen these around...but never have I visited one.   We got here, and there wasn't much of a wait which is always awesome. My first issue came with the seat choice of the host. Knowing it's about 31 degrees, and i was with a woman and 2 small children, we were sat RIGHT by the door. Not even 10 feet Away...every time someone opened the door, we got smacked with a cold breeze. Definitely had to keep the kids bundled up.....the whole time. That put a damper in the whole mood... and everyone  but me was ready to go. Other than that, our server was pretty cool. He gave some recommendations as asked, and helped guide us to what he thought was best based on what we wanted.   I ended up ordering a salmon scramble...with grits and potatoes. I wasn't impressed at all. The grits are the truth tho. I will say that.  The creamy savory flavor was definitely a winner.  But the salmon in the tscramble, tasted like it came out of a can.. I had to make sure it was salmon, and not spam or something. The potatoes...kinda soggy... and got cold pretty fast-- with that breeze from the door that kept coming... they didn't stand a chance. Lastly, the biscuits. They are big, and somewhat fluffy inside, but they aren't all that. They were a little over cooked , and that house cranberry jam they serve with it.... too much.   For the kids they had French toast and chicken sausage. They loved the French toast...didn't really eat the sausage. The Ms..she ordered a veggie omelette, she said it was okay, but the marinara sauce on it was overbearing and threw her off.   All in all... unfortunately, I can't say I'd throw this place in the hat of places id love to go back to. If invited , I'd go...but it wouldn't be my suggestion. There just wasn't enough that stuck out to me.",

Amazing service from Claudia, shes super knowledgeable and helpful, and pays attention to detail. Tosciano is a shining star that easily makes the trip worth it. When you have caring staff like them that are smart, quick, hospitable, and attentive in a super busy famous restaurant it makes the biscuits that much sweeter.  Speaking of which, I absolutely recommend the biscuits. I was surprised to be so full by the meal that I couldn't finish my biscuits. The biscuits are pretty big, portions are large, food is well seasoned, very southern and will make you an addict. I can't wait to come back for more.",

Oven Fried Green Tomatoes - no seasoning, soggy, breading falling apart, tasted so bad. Heavenly French Toast - this was just plain soft toast. It should be a punishable offense to call this French toast - horrible. Clifton Omelette - the goat cheese in this was again very cold and just didn't go with the rest of the omelette - I tried to eat around the cheese to obtain some nourishment from this poor meal. The biscuit was doughy, the potatoes that came with it were passable. Overall, never ordering from here again, and I don't think dining in person will make a difference. Definitely do not recommend.",

All the meals come with a giant homemade biscuit dusted with sugar, and it pairs perfectly with the amazing apple butter that is a fixture on each table. I had the veggie scramble and it was extremely flavorful and the eggs were done perfectly. The portions are huge but not overwhelming. The fresh fruit option is also pretty decent, they have the classic pineapple and honeydew with grapes but it was a decent portion so it didn't feel like cop out fruit. In addition to my breakfast I tried the creamy dreamy grits- boy were they good! I added a sugar packet and they were heavenly.   Aside from the food, the atmosphere is great- very colorful with  upbeat music that is just the right volume. They serve all drinks with paper straws which makes my environmentalist heart sing! The coffee was hot and fresh and our server was super nice, they had a back up in the kitchen and he was transparent about that so that we weren't left hanging and hungry. The prices are decent and proportional to the food you're served.   This place is great for a family, a hangover breakfast, and everything in between! I'm currently here as a tacky tourist but if I'm back this will be a staple!",

    "text": "I don't know why it is, but I've learned that whenever a restaurant has a particular dish in its name, that's usually the worst item on the menu. Flying Biscuit is no exception. The biscuits are thick, heavy and bland (though that apple butter or whatever sauce is amazing and helps things out a lot). So don't go expecting a big flaky delish biscuit.  But for breakfast, it's pretty hard to go wrong. I went on an early Saturday afternoon and had the Clifton omelette, with goat cheese, mushrooms and tomato, and it was just as good as it sounds. Hubby got the Piedmont and left not a speck on the plate. Service was a bit slow and unresponsive, and it wasn't even very busy. The waittress was young, but she just didn't seem very interested in serving or filling water or earning a tip? Still, neither the chicken nor the biscuit will dissuade me from stopping in again. Good deal--especially if you check in on 4square. Can I say that?",

But I think there is a lot of hype over this place because there aren't enough \"alternative\" diet restaurants in the area. If you have ever lived in Boone or Asheville, then you know that there are loads of \"alternative\" restaurants, constantly having to strive to be their best in order to compete. My family has gone to the flying biscuit every once in a while for years, and I don't think the menu has ever changed. Also, the place is way too small, the wait is generally way too long, the tables are cramped, and it is usually very noisy.   Also, either last year or the year before an employee was murdered by another employee in the kitchen. It made my stomach turn that they didn't move locations. It was also revealed that they hadn't bothered to run a background check on the murderer (who had a criminal record), so that didn't sit well with me either.",

Honestly I'm always trying to find a replacement for my beloved Hobee's  in the SF Bay Area, with no avail.  Well Flying Biscuit is certainly popular in the QC and has a large number of tables.  As someone else put, it has a colorful and fun interior.   The menu has several egg options but for some reason or another I really only saw 1 or 2 I would eat. One time the veggie scramble was awesome, the last time it had a funky taste. Their Shrimp & Grits was 5/5 awesome because their \"creamy dreamy grits\" are appropriately named. I ate myself sick in fact. The first time I went I was so excited to see organic oatmeal pancakes with peaches, as I always make it a tradition to have Cracker Barrel's freestone peach pancakes after triathlons and I always try and eat organic. Alas, they were such a disappointment and I had to scrape off the nasty peaches. The Stud didn't believe me until he tried it.   That said, they totally redeemed themselves with their chocolate chip pancakes that are to DIE for- 5/5 perfectly fluffy but with a nice hard edge to them (trust me). Wow.  Their \"signature\" chicken sausage is really disappointing. We have Aidell's Chicken Apple sausage from Costco every weekend and Flying Biscuits' sausage can't even come close to comparing. Dry and meh.  Here's the confusing part- the biscuits, after which the restaurant is named is not the best part of the meal. They are indeed a bit hard (even at peak times) and they have a nice flavor but are definitely not soaked in lard so they tend to be a bit dry. They seem NOT to be southern style which is odd.   Eh?  Coffee is OK, OJ is OK, peach nectar is delish.  Service is average.  So as you can see, some things are GREAT, and some things are meh.  To people that don't have such high breakfast standards, it's probably great. To me, the search continues...  Tip: Check in on Foursquare and get free OJ or dessert.",

When entering, I immediately loved the decor...bright colors, some nice displays, old style pottery with sugar cubes at each table.  The waitress was extremely friendly and was extremely efficient.   The menu options were diverse and simple at the same time.  I ordered a grilled chicken wrap with 'moon dusted' potatoes.  Both items were delicious-- the rosemary and spices on the potatoes gave them a very unique and wonderful flavor.  Overall I was very pleased with the amount of food for the price, the atmosphere, and the taste of my brunch.  I would definitely go back to sample some of the other dishes!",

I've only gone during not so busy times, but the service is great!  Great, delicious vegan options as well! Try the Vegan BBQ burrito!  It's a little bit of heaven in a nice tortilla wrap!  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to soliciting their friends to Charlotte!  Awesome and trendy come to mind!!!  The wait staff have been very friendly and in fun moods and willing to offer legitimate suggestions, which is always a good meal experience for me!  They also off an extensive menu that includes dinner entrees and boast a menu with breakfast all day, so all you brinner people have a great lil haven in Charlotte!!! :)",

I got the High Flyer breakfast which was way too much food, but a great mix of everything.  The grits were probably the best I've ever had, and I didn't leave one bite behind- they were creamy & delicious. The oatmeal pancake with peach compote & the biscuit which had just a little bit of sugar on top, were equally good.  Knowing I wouldn't be able to eat all of that food, I left the eggs behind since I figured I could get those anywhere!  Cute space, open floor plan, friendly service, reasonable prices.  If I had to dock points for anything it would be that they're located in a strip mall which is a little less appealing, but for food this good who gives a flying biscuit?!",

    "text": "LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  The first time we stepped foot into Flying Biscuit was in Atlanta.  Whenever we visit our friend in ATL we would always go to the Midtown location.  We'd get there around 8:00am, put in our name down, and wait...45min - 1hr later we'd get seated.  It was always totally worth the wait!   Now Charlotte has 2 locations!  If you get there after 8-9am on the weekends, you will definitely have to wait, maybe 15-30 min.  I love the eclectic menu.  They have some traditional items (steak and eggs, omlettes, and biscuits and gravy) and some fun nontraditional ones (black bean cakes, scrambled tofu, and orange scented french toast).  Obviously, they are known for their biscuits.  They are not like the normal flakey buttery biscuits you may be used to.  They have a scone-like consistency, solid and firm on the outside and soft on the inside.  The cranberry apple butter is to die for.  It's sweet yet tangy! YUMMY!  I was never a fan of grits until I tried them there.  They are the creamiest grits in the world!  Now every time I go out for breakfast somewhere else, I always want to get grits, but it's never ever as good as FB.  So I stopped trying them at other places.  Sorry other breakfast guys...Flying Biscuit has the BEST grits EVER!  The only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is the service.  The Park Rd location has extremely slow service.  Every other time we go the service is so slow, even when they are not busy.  I took my family there for breakfast and we got seated before 2 other tables around us.  The other tables had their drinks and appetizer orders before we were even greeted by our waitress.  We complained and the manager gave us a complimentary fried green tomato appetizer (which was really good).  Hopefully they will work on it.",

The omelets are large, the biscuits are yum (but are substantially better before they start to sit out too long post breakfast-rush), and my eggs are always cooked nicely. My serious gripe with the place is the wait time, no matter if I'm one of five tables or one of twenty five - it always takes what seems like FOREVER to get my food. And of course I can't even get a water refill while I wait, for a place so open the service staff has found some really good places to hide!  That being said I've still kept the flying biscuit on my list, because their food is pretty good (so far I think the cajun scramble is my favorite) and you don't have to worry about your eggs arriving in a pool of grease like some other breakfast all day establishments.",

I have waited tables over the years. I couldn't believe her body language and attitude. I ordered the Southern Style Biscuit Benedict. It was delicious!

    "text": "Yes, it's a chain. You wouldn't know it, though, except that the ceiling tiles are screen printed instead of hand painted with winged biscuits and other such culinary literalisms. For some reason, that element makes the Charlotte locations smell of franchise. Otherwise, the interiors do a decent job pushing the pretense that the restaurant is in a converted bungalow near those of the original Biscuit in Atlanta's Candler Park, or that it is a hometown diner that has been there for years instead of doing business in Charlotte's newer and oldest shopping centers.  Lines form on weekend mornings with people salivating over the breakfast served all day on Fiestaware, especially the biscuits sprinkled with sugar and served with homemade cranberry apple butter. And those grits. Those creamy, dreamy grits that made this lifelong grits detester see the light at the end of the hominyless tunnel. Grits can and should be made with heavy cream. If they aren't, they aren't worth eating.  Lunch and dinner options are as tasty as those from the breakfast all day menu; many are altered with eggs or the lack thereof to make them appropriate for the time of day. Case in point: Egg-Ceptional Eggs and Love Cakes, both of which are in the Top Five Favorites dishes of this writer. Daily specials are posted on the boards outside, and are usually worth a try. Menu substitutions are easy, and so is the staff, which in general is pleasantly attentive.  Though it is not a Charlotte original, we'll claim it as our own, if only for those devilishly alluring grits.  Flying Biscuit has two Charlotte locations; one in Stonecrest Shopping Center at 7930-A Rea Road and the other in Park Road Shopping Center at 4241 Park Road.",

We usually go to the one in Stonecrest but decided to go here since it was closer. Easy parking, no wait, place was about 1/2 full early Saturday evening. Vibe is similar to the other one, bright colors, diner-like atmosphere. However, this one has really bright lighting.   Kids all ordered choco milk and chocolate chip pancakes (more on this later). Both the wife and I ordered variations on the green tomato BLT - I had the sandwich, she had the salad. We also ordered the soup of the day - tomato basil bisque.   Soup was rock star good - not sure if it was the soup, the cold day, swimming or all of the above, but we devoured it! In fact, it was so good our younger son got his own bowl! Of course, the soup comes with the trademark biscuits with apple butter (which makes them for me!). When the chocolate chip pancakes arrived they were HUGE portions! These were not the kid size but the full adult size portions. We figured it was a mistake but figured it would make for a good dogie bag for tomorrow. The green tomato BLTs were very tasty, in particular the jalepeno-cashew relish that comes on top! The combo of turkey bacon, the relish, fried green tomato and goat cheese is very unusual but balanced.   While we were eating the manager came by and asked about us, mentioned the pancake thing, which we said was no big deal. We then got to talking to Brandon, who also works there. Very friendly, nice guy and we mentioned our daughter had just had her birthday. . . before you know it Brandon had ordered us a birthday brownie sunday for our table! It was also very good - dark chocolate and cream cheese brownie with ice cream, whipped cream, the whole nine yards. . . We were pleasantly surprised to say the least!  When the check arrived not only was the brownie comped, but all of our pancake orders had been reduced to kids orders!! So basically we got free desert and breakfast for three for the next day on the house. Pretty exceptional service by any standard!  Overall, we already liked Flying Biscuit but this sold us as devoted customers!",

Flying Biscuit is a chain, but has a nice homey feel with the murals on the walls and purple, and bright colored decor. It just screams \"neighborhood and family\".  When you have a restaurant with the word BISCUIT in the name, I'd expect a big flaky, moist biscuit with a buttery golden outside.  Instead, their biscuits are white and dense like Bisquick dollop biscuits. It's fine...but the redeeming factor is the cranberry-apple butter that comes in a squeeze bottle on your table.   I had the grits since THREE people recommended it to me-- and yes, it indeed buttery and cheesy and super seasoned and bursting with flavor.  Though it was so rich, I felt bloated and gross afterward.  I suggest using willpower to stop eating after your full...but it's hard since this dish is so mouth watering.  My husband got the fried green tomato sandwich which was delicious, but INSANELY rich with bacon and I believe cheese too.  It was too greasy for his taste, and too made him feel too bloated.   Our server was really great about keeping our ice teas coming, and any condiments we needed.  Overall, I'd come back again, but probably would order different items.",

They'd been there in the past and had great things to say about the homemade biscuits and apple butter.  We arrived at noon on Saturday and the place was packed. There was no where to seat our large party so we ended up on the patio at the rear of the restaurant.  For the most part we were alone with the funky hanging art and water spritzing fans.  The restaurant seems to be a bit cramped, so I wasn't upset.  Looking at the menu I had a tough time deciding what to order.  There were so many options, both sweet and savory.  Since I wanted to try a bit of everything, I went for the High Flyer.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into. So much food!  I had never tried chicken sausage before, but I was quite impressed.  The grits were absolutely delicious and creamy.  My favorite thing overall was the oatmeal pancake.  It was thick and fluffy and perfectly matched with the peach compote.  Everyone was happy with their brunch selection.  The only issues with our meal were the slight snafus by our server.  Because we were out back, she seemed to forget about us every so often.  My friend had ordered an appetizer, but it was not brought out until he had reminded the waitress toward the end of our meal.  Not a huge ordeal considering how much other food we had already devoured.    If I were in the area again, I'd definitely return.  There are so many options to try, I'm sure I'd never get the same thing twice.",

    "text": "I very much enjoyed my meal here, the food was quite good, and the friendly, funny staff made it even better.  Located at Park Road Shopping Center (if you look towards the middle of the strip, it will be slightly to the right of center, in close proximity to Suarez Bakery), what a fun, cute place for a meal.  Park Road SC is currently redoing their signage, so it's a little more difficult to spot a new-to-me place, but the banner signs are readable.   There is parallel parking just in front of the stores, or there is plenty of angled parking in the lot.  The place:  Cute space with both booths and tables/chairs, along with a small bar.  Brightly colored Hawaiianish table cloths make for a happy environment.  The staff:  Ridiculously friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  When I asked the waitress for what her favorites were, as I had never been to a Flying Biscuit before, she gave me some suggestions with explanations.  Awesome!  The food:  I took the waitress's suggestion and ordered the High Flyer, which offers a sampling of everything - 2 eggs, grits, chicken sausage and a pancake.  I substituted a blueberry pancake for the oatmeal pancake, which I ate with only the light dusting of powdered sugar that it was served with, and it was delicious - light and full of blueberry flavor.  The eggs were cooked to my over-well request and were very good, not greasy at all, with the perfect crispness that I like.  The grits were indeed creamy and dreamy and probably the best grits I have ever eaten.  The chicken sausage was well flavored and cooked to perfection (I wasn't a huge fan of it, but I think that is my personal taste and not a reflection of the sausage).  And the biscuit... well... again, I wasn't a fan.  For the type of biscuit that it was, it was well flavored and structured, with a little sugar baked on top for a sweet, slightly crunchy finish, but I like lighter, biscuitier biscuits (Cracker Barrel, Poogan's Porch in Charleston), but they were good.  The accompaniment of the cranberry apple butter in a squeeze bottle was amazing - that was delicious and I could have eaten that right from the bottle - YUM!!  We also tried the grilled mac and cheese which are molded rectangles of mac and cheese.  $3 for 3 rectangles - it was mac and cheesy (good to cure a macheese craving, nothing spectacular).  Wednesday, as the cute young man told me when I entered, is kid's night.  I don't know what kid's night entails, but there will be squealing children and wincing mommies getting glass after glass of wine.  The food was a solid 4 and with the addition of the awesome staff, I am rounding up to a 5.",

I was so stuff I didn't eat again until dinner. The food is so fresh and they use organic ingredients. There whole menu is full of great meals.

Fried green tomatoes were an appetizer, and they were gooey without being too crispy. These were my first fried green tomatoes since I'm not a N. Carolina native, but still great. My boyfriend had the blueberry pancakes and we basically shared. You could actually taste the lightly sweetened pancake and the fresh blueberries. So good. So filling.

Since he has relocated to the area from California, I thought it would be fun to hit the reknown \"Flying Biscuit Cafe\" for breakfast (early early return flight). I had never been there, but have friends that rave. Anyway, the menu offers few truly healthy choices, but he was able to pick something. I picked the most popular breakfast platter. Can't remember the name, it's literally the first one on the menu. Anyway, my eggs were so-so, the chicken sausage disgusting (dry yet greasy???) and the biscuit was a little hard. I thought, \"What is all the fuss about?\" We were seated outside pretty quickly and the wait staff was pretty efficient and friendly. Anyway, I've had better (not just in NYC which blows this area away) so I most likely won't return.",

Major brownie points for that. I ordered the Pimento eggs Benedict, it was really great. It was different with the pimento and super filling. I would go ahead and order that again. Colin got this odd oatmeal pancake, I don't think he will get that again. Overall, if you're looking for a quick diner like breakfast place, give Flying Biscuit a try.",

The constituents of a good breakfast contain a lot of the same items: eggs, sausage/bacon, toast/biscuit, maybe even pancakes/waffles.  the difference lies in the delivery.  thats what makes the breakfast unique.    now if your looking for a typical biscuit or bland grits this is not the place for you.  maybe Denny's is more your thing (and thats cool).  We had the \"high flier\" breakfast easily decided for the sampling of the breakfast options.  It has 2 eggs, 2 pieces of chicken sausage patties, a bowl of creamy grits, a famous flying biscuit dusted with sugar, and oatmeal pancake with peach compote.  all served with a side of cranberry spice jam.  we had our eggs scrambled with cheese and they were great.  the chicken sausage was excellent for both a sausage eater and made my non-pork eating guest very happy ^_^.  the grits were off the hook.  everything good creamy grits should be where you dont have to add a thing.  i would seriously go back strictly for these grits.  i was stealing them off my guest's plate after i inhaled mine, heh.  the biscuits (which are served with each entree, and can be ordered al la carte) had a great crumbly texture on the outside, and a chewy soft texture on the inside.  the dusting of sugar gave it a perfect sweet touch, made just right with a pat of butter.  should you want to construct your own sausage and egg biscuit with some jam you have the arsenal to do so.  you would be happy eating each piece of the high flyer breakfast on its own or combining them into a flavor layered creation.   finally, the pancake.  we were so full with everything preceding it, that we couldnt imagine eating the whole thing.  however, it had a great oat and nutty taste and texture.  it was great sans-butter or dipped into the warm peach compote.  the compote was a nice peach and light syrup topping but it didn't taste like it came from a can.   We had coffee and i had sweet tea to drink.  the coffee was very good and they offered all types of sweeteners INCLUDING a cleverly disguised bowel of lump sugar at the table!  the sweet tea was ON POINT.  this is proper fucking sweet tea.  if seriously sweet tea makes you squeamish, dont order this.  it will give you the shakes and i dont want any arrhythmia on my conscience.      our waiter was Daniel and was extremely polite, attentive and ready to please.  As stated in the other reviews this is the most interesting eclectic, artsy and inspiring breakfast place.  gazing up at the ceiling tiles made me rethink my own plain acoustic tiles back home.  The music was very appropriate and suited the atmosphere.  it wasnt loud, and the instrumental rockabilly tunes were adding to the atmosphere.    all of this for under $30 at a breakfast place. i would have had less of a well rounded and fulfilling experience if i were dining out for dinner and dropping $100.    so when you see the line out the door, go ahead and wait the 20 minutes.  its well worth it.",

This restaurant pop up and my experience there was unmatched to any other I encountered in Charlotte thus far. I had the Flying Biscuit Meal which included grits comma chicken sausage, and something from Heaven called oatmeal pancakes. At first glance it sounded questionable. I could not believe how good this was it was fantastic. The oatmeal pancakes tasted as if it had fruit or something in it it was more of a dessert then breakfast but actually made of oatmeal so you don't feel so guilty. The Great's were the best I had in Charlotte so far that includes every restaurant Uptown and in Midtown the warm Peaches on top of the pancakes made me want to cry. And the biscuits were just sick. Topped with an apple butter you could not believe it was this good. Of course bring an appetite and prepare to have a take-home box because the portions are huge. I could not possibly eat it all in one sitting but, I enjoyed eating it all the next day. This will be a go-to place for me as long as I reside in Charlotte. Best breakfast ever. The Grits are out of this world they won't tell me what's in it though.",

Bring an appetite.  Portions are generous, and the food is very flavorful.

Flying Biscuit, with one location near my house and my dad's office (Park Rd.) and one location near my parents' house (Ballantyne), has thus far fit the bill.  It gets two stars just for achieving that feat alone.  It gets another star for the wide variety of its menu, which includes all-day breakfast foods (all of which look pretty great) and plenty of veg-friendly options.  It gets a fourth star because when I ate there, I was served pretty decent food.  I ordered the black bean quesadilla, which was gigantic and melty and beany and covered with a really delicious chipotle sauce.  I'm eager to dive into their breakfast menu next time I visit; the range of options alone gives me great hope.  I do not, however, believe that I'll be a regular here, maybe because it's a little too... commercial-y?  It tries desperately to affect a whimsical, authentic decor, but it's all a little too shiny for my taste, and underneath the whimsy, I detect the movements of a business desperate for more franchises.  Not that that's always bad.  But, you know.",

I had hoped that other menu offerings lived up to the hype, but I got a resounding \"NO\" from my table mates. On the upside, the service was lightning fast.

The biscuit was a heavy lump of dough - no 'flying' to it. The omelette was also flat - totally deflated. The pancake my husband was served was almost burnt on one side (the down side of course), it was replaced but honestly wasn't much better - dense and not very tasty. The grits were okay.

The initial reason I chose this establishment is bc I had a massive craving for Shrimp & Grits. The night before went to a Louisiana style restaurant and ordered the Shrimp & Grits which was different than I was use to lol. Thank you Flying Biscuit cause the Shrimp & Grits were amazing and delicious. I also ordered the Steak & Eggs which came with grits which was also great. I ordered it rare and it came out well done so that's something they could work on.  The service was top notch and I never had to ask for anything since our waitress was so attentive. For those of you looking for a quick mimosa with brunch, guess what they have mimosas and their not half bad.   As for the decor, it's a bit out dated so it could use a little sprucing up but that doesn't affect the food. Very diverse and great food so be prepared to wait about 20-30 mins but it's soooo worth the wait!",

I tend to order the same thing every time and it's like they have a Xerox machine back there... the dish comes out the same every time.  The food is pretty standard diner fare, with a few signature items.  The biscuits, of course, are special.  They are HUGE and lean more towards a shortcake to me (add some macerated strawberries and fresh cream... serious desert opportunity here, FBC!) but they are very tasty and always fresh.  There is a delicious cranberry apple butter (made in-house) on the table that goes perfectly w/ the biscuits.  Their grits are also outstanding... one of the few places where I enjoy grits.",

The biscuits were good (a little too doughy for my liking), the potatoes were excellent along with the pumpkin spice mimosa (very sweet!). All around a great spot to grab some good food and relax",

Later on though, you definitely see the list getting longer and longer. THE GRITS, YOU GUYS. I could literally eat a bucket of them. Like I think I could win some kind of grits eating contest with them.   There are a lot of options and creative dishes beyond your usual breakfast fare.   One of the best things is we had our 10 month old with us and it is super kid friendly. We didn't feel awkward having him there, which you can certainly feel is the vibe with some other places.",

The grits were pretty good, but as someone who doesn't get grits often I'm not picky.   The atmosphere is fun and quirky, service was efficient.  It's tucked in to a shopping plaza with plenty of parking.  Thought about going back during my stay but wanted to try as many places as I could before leaving. Solid breakfast!",

Odd location deep inline in the shopping center with a very small sign so keep your eyes open.  I ordered the 3b grilled chicken sandwich with roasted potatoes and was very happy.  The aioli and blue cheese mixed well, although I think there could have been a little more blue cheese.  The turkey bacon had a nice flavor (for turkey bacon) and added some crunch to the sandwich.  The chicken was done well and still moist.  The bun, lettuce, and tomato were good compliments.  Service and atmosphere were average.  If you are close by, Flying Biscuit is worth a chance.",

The spot is trendy and cute with a sliding garage door to merge inside and outside seating. My mom and I dinned outside on the inexpensive chrome table and chair set.  It was adorable and reminded me of my Barbie set as a child.  Chicken Biscuit Pot Pie was my order and my mother went with eggs, sausage, and pasta.  My food wasn't bad, but it is not the pot pie your mother makes.  The food on my mom's plate was screaming try me, so I did and was surprised.  Everything was blended so well on her plate, but the taste was separate.  I tasted the eggs, pasta, sausage, and greens all separately even though it was on my fork and in my mouth at the same time.  Talk about an inability to marry ingredients. I sucked down two oversized cups of cherry soda, paid the bill and tip to the friendly server, and we left.  If you are looking for super-tasty food, I would not make this place your top pick.  But if you are looking for food that is organic, filling, and has a very different taste, I would pull out a chair and prepare yourself for a healthy meal courtesy of The Flying Biscuit Cafe.",

I have had to refill my own drinks, hunt down servers, etc. one time, a server showed up with a tray of drinks, set them down, and said \"I don't know where these go,\" and walked away.

They were nothing more than wheat bread thrown on a skillet with butter and raspberry drizzle. Nice try at making something basic look elegant. And its called the flying biscuit which would make you think they have great biscuits. Nah. The biscuits are bland at best. I'm willing to give this place another try but definitely not anytime soon.",

I went for lunch on a weekday and the place was only half full yet they seemed short-staffed because 1) no one was at the front, so I wanted awhile before someone came and seated us, 2) all the waiters/waitresses were scrambling around with stoic looks on their faces with apparently no time to be friendly, 3) it took awhile for a waiter to come to our table. There was no friendly greeting, just a curt acknowledgement of my order and off she went. I think we exchanged less than 5 words the entire time.  Service was definitely lacking, and the food was equally disappointing. I miss the southern hospitality and delicious food of the Flying Biscuit in Atlanta.. At this Charlotte location, one side of my pancake was completely tough like cardboard. I tried, but I could only finish half my plate. Other reviewers seem to have had different experiences. Maybe they were having an off-day?",

With biscut and gravy(cant remember the name). The gravy tasted like stuffing and the main course had alot of flavor but they didnt complement eachother. The coffee was good.

We needed to place an order immediately so headed to the bar and explained that we would be eating there once the other party members came in but needed to get an order in. There was a young lady and man behind the bar that immediately hopped to our service. They begin moving tables and everything! They placed our order and were so kind and accommodating!   Did I mention the food was amazing! I had the shrimp scramble--yum!",

We tried coming here a few times to be turned off by the wait but if only I knew how satisfying the meal would be, I'd wait days   The atmosphere is awesome, very colorful and inviting. It reminded me of a cafe I used to work in during college and brought back so many great memories!   I ordered the tradition breakfast I believe it was called. Omg I had no idea how much food was about to be put in front of me. It was 2 eggs, grits, turkey sausage, a biscuit, and an organic oatmeal pancake. And to add to the crazy amount of food I already had, I decided to order a side of grilled Mac and cheese. Just thinking about it right now, my mouth is watering. The eggs were eggs, hard to mess up. Who knew turkey sausage could be so good compared to the real thing! Biscuit was out of this world, just fell apart and melted in my mouth. The grits were also something to note, so creamy and so cheesy, my favorite! The pancake was fantastic and didn't even need syrup. And finally, the Mac and cheese...I could eat this all day everyday. They were just the right amount of grilled and greasy enough to enjoy the fatness.   I can not wait to go and try some more of the endless items on the menu!!",

They only serve turkey bacon here I think. I much prefer the regular bacon. They make their own jam sauce here that they have in a jar on every table. The fruit they had in season was grape, melon, and pineapple. Portion of fruit was small for $4. Overall food was ok. First time here since we had a layover at airport so decided to explore Charlotte.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a \"Southern-inspired\" comfort food restaurant, The Flying Biscuit Cafe. Located in the Park Road area of Charlotte, this popular meeting spot features breakfast all day plus salads, sandwiches, and plate meals.  Dora here. Unlike last week's choice, I knew The Flying Biscuit Cafe would be a great experience. A couple weeks ago, we stopped here, but the crowd outside and the corresponding long wait deterred us. This week we strategically timed our visit, hoping to fall sometime after the breakfast crowd and before lunch. And, also unlike last week, our server seemed to really love her job. She was knowledgeable, helpful with suggestions, and stopped by our table several times to check on us and refill our drinks, always with a smile even though they were obviously super busy. Don't let the skinny exterior deceive you. This cafe goes a long ways back with another outdoor patio in the rear.  For a starter, we ordered a side of Grilled Macaroni and Cheese that Yelpers rave about. This mac and cheese is nothing like I have ever tasted. Rectangle blocks of mac and cheese grilled to perfection, somewhat crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Dora here. This alone was worth the drive. Fluffy, light, you don't really even taste the pasta. The texture comes off more like a souffle. HEAVENLY!  For my lunch (breakfast), I chose the Egg-Stravaganza. Two poached eggs, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, grits and whole wheat French toast topped with raspberry sauce and a honey cream. This dish was outstanding, eggs cooked to the exact time and consistency, grits were creamy and cheesy. The French toast wasn't overly egg-y or thick, almost tasted like pumpernickel bread, so I was surprised to find out it was actually wheat bread. Whatever the type, the sauce and cream were a great accompaniment.  Dora here. Y'all, check out the Very Berry Chicken Wrap. Doesn't it look refreshing? It was!! Great texture from the candied walnuts, fresh flavors, light on the raspberry vinaigrette, loaded with chunky chicken, delish! The perfect choice for a hot summer afternoon, I would definitely order this again. Maybe not the Garlic and Basil Mashed Potatoes because I prefer my taters a bit creamier.  What about you? How do you prefer your French Toast? Or not a fan at all? We'd love to know!

Everything is worth trying...there's nothing that I would tell you to stay away from.  The biscuits of course..while not really being able to fly, are a wonderful fluffy deliciousness.  The restaurant is slightly on the small side and there is chance for a wait.  It is uniquely decorated and there is plenty to look at while waiting.  ****In response to Chris S.....I just feel the menu could be spiced up a little.  Maybe more app choices or even small plates would be cool.  I have nothing bad to say about he current menu..but maybe a weekly or seasonal special? Something different to try.****",

    "text": "We love coming here for brunch. Be sure to call in if your party is bigger than 2, it's normally a 10 minute wait for a couple of people. It's always packed so service can get a little backed up. We sat at the patio yesterday, they have heaters, don't worry. I prefer to sit inside though, better to people watch while you wait for food.  I like to start off with a hot chocolate and those heavenly love cakes. The love cakes are soft but flavorful black bean cakes smothered in tasty salsa verde and topped with a dollop of sour cream and feta cheese crumbles. This is literally my favorite item on the menu and it doesn't make you feel bad for eating it. The chicken sausage gravy is my runner up fav menu item, it's so good with everything, especially home fries.  I normally order the smoked salmon scramble or the souther biscuit Benedict if I want to get crazy full. I only really like the Benedict if I take it home and reheat it. The salmon scramble has this amazing cream cheese and dill sauce. We've also got the side of grilled Mac and cheese, it's ok but needs some seasoning. The biscuits and huge and chalky, you will need gravy, butter, or jam to get through it.   Worth the wait, must try at least once.",

I've been here several times as I keep saying \"I'll give it another shot. I'll go mid-week\".....anddddddd it's the same not so grand experience for me.  :(    Let me tell you what I do like:  1) I like the location.  It's in Park Road Shopping Center which is close to home.  Check 2) I like the staff.  Although they are COMPLETELY slammed at peek hours, they always seem to make me smile and laugh and they're good. 3) The apple butter is heavenly 4)Mimosa pours are HUGE.  5) those biscuits tho   What I don't like and why I give it 2 stars: 1) Every time and I mean every time...I come here, My food order is COLD.  I even order it differently so they'll have to make it fresh.  :( 2)  They seem to always forget to seat us.  This is a popular place and they are slammed...I get that...but how you skip over our name when we see you mark it down the last several times we've been here is crazy.   3) on top of the food being cold, it's just not fresh.  My scrambled eggs are overcooked, the pancakes are hard and stale...it's just not good food.    So...I think this last visit has made me decide to break-up with Flying Biscuit when it comes to going here for the food.  I'll come for the coffee and mimosas and biscuits...but not the food.  (sorry..don't hate me!)",

The girlfriend found this place through Yelp and we were conveniently already driving in its direction.  The Southern Style Biscuit Benedict was intriguing. I'm always down for some good eggs benedict. I'd say the dish overall was pretty good, though I found the biscuits to be a little dry for my taste. The Creamy Dreamy Grits were on point though. At first taste, I thought nothing of it, but I couldn't stop eating and finished off the bowl.  The girlfriend ordered the less intriguing Breakfast Bowl. Truth be told, hers was the better dish. Fried green tomatoes, turkey bacon, and two eggs served over their Creamy Dreamy Grits and topped with salsa. It was a surprisingly excellent combination of flavors.  Even though I didn't care for their biscuits in my eggs benedict, I enjoyed the hot and fresh biscuit they gave us on the side. They have this cranberry apple butter concoction in a bottle that you can squeeze right onto the biscuit. Genius!  Friendly service. Good food. Our trip was off to a solid start.",

Today one breakfast w coffee and a $3.50 side of turnip greens (side of greens was small and contained a lot of stems) was $22 before tip and the food was disappointing (except the grits and biscuit which is always on point). The portions were tiny and presentation was lacking. Asked for almond milk instead of creamer for one cup of coffee and that splash of almond milk showed on the ticket as a $1 charge too. Just overall seemed like the cost was not compensatory to the food we got. $22 for a small basic breakfast and a tiny stems side of greens. Won't come back unless it's for grits and a biscuit.

    "text": "This is a great spot to meet a friend for breakfast or brunch and I mean A (one) friend. The restaurant works hard to pack larger parties into the tight space but that's really not their target market. Cafes are typically quaint, smaller tables, intimate atmospheres... The Flying Biscuit, somewhat, desired that feel but didn't quite hit it. Their biscuits became to popular.  Now, by biscuits, I don't mean the kind you want to grab with grease covered chicken fingers. These biscuits are sweeter, a little more dense and have a dusting of sugar on top. Almost more sourdough in texture but not exactly. Delicious, paired with the right breakfast accompaniments but don't expect Bojangles.  The service is fairly quick considering the small space, large groups, issue. I think my friend were in and out within 30 minutes, maybe less. Honestly, we would have sat around a while but we didn't want to hold up a table.  If I could pick a home town for this cafe, it would be Asheville. If you haven't been to Asheville, it's a smallish city with some hippie vibe but surrounded by money. Kind of an odd collection of people but totally unique. That is somewhat how I feel about the menu at Flying Biscuit, too. Some, not so traditional, breakfast items mixed with some more common ones. More expensive than an IHOP but the restaurant wanted a different, unique vibe. Peas in a pod, really.",

The flying biscuit was a vegetarian dream for breakfast! The place was packed, though. It was bright and colorful and the tables are arranged to get the most out of the space so don't try to take a really big group there because you'll need to wait. I ordered the pancake of the day; had nuts and bananas, along with the tofu scramble, creamy grits and of course a fluffy biscuit with a side of apple butter! I was so upset I was on a time crunch and didn't have time to eat everything but baby... it was all so good! The grits were thick enough to hold on your spoon and creamy and rich. The tofu scramble had fresh peppers and onions and some kind of seasoning or marinade that tied it all together, perfectly! The biscuit?? The biscuit was about four or five inches high! The apple butter was the perfect condiment for it, too! How did they know?? I barely finished the pancake, as it was as big as the plate it came on! I have no friends or family in Charlotte, so I don't know when I'll be back, but whenever I am fortunate enough to be near this place, I plan to fill up, Flying Biscuit style!",

There are lots of good breakfast options, but a bit expensive for the quality. The flying biscuits biscuit is actually nice too, unlike anything I've had anywhere else, flaky and different to the regular biscuits you get for breakfast. Besides that, everything else was mediocre. The dusted potatoes were overdone and so hard we could not finish them. The eggs reminded me of stuff that is made without real eggs...not worth what I paid...I could not finish those either. Let's just say I was a bit disappointed, but if all I was going to have were grits...that's what I'll be getting!",

We did have to wait 30 minutes because we went during Sunday brunch time, but it was totally worth the wait. I ordered the southern style biscuit benedict and it was perfect. It was a biscuit topped with pimento cheese, two poached eggs and bacon (they let you choose between regular or turkey). They top it with hollandaise sauce and garnish with fresh basil. FANTASTIC. Kind of wish they opened a location closer to me. The staff is also super friendly. Also, try their coffee porter, its really good.",

First off the restaurant was very busy which should be a good sign but not no. I ordered eggs over easy with bacon and potatoes and one buttermilk pancake cake and a side of grits. Grits were good. Pancake was terrible not fluffy at all. Eggs were good. Biscuit was awful like somebody forgot to mix in The baking powder properly. The potatoes were over seasoned and peppery. No one refilled our coffee nor was there cream on the table. Husband ordered oatmeal pancakes which arrived cold and hockey puck like. The waitress took them back and subsequently returned them warmer but still hockey puck like. All in all food was mediocre, tasteless and uninspired. I do not recommend this place.",

Everything is pretty much homemade, from their biscuits to sausage gravy. So far I haven't had a mean that disappoints. My suggestions would be the Breakfast Bowl, Biscuits and Gravy, & the Turkey Hash. The Turkey Hash has extremely tender turkey over top of a bed of potatoes. The Breakfast Bowl not only looks pretty, it tastes pretty amazing too; 2 eggs over 2 fried green tomatoes over a bed of creamy grits with salsa. The great news is they sell Breakfast all day! The location in Charlotte is always packed but they cycle through people pretty quickly. A great place to bring visitors or just a good Sunday morning brunch! They also cater, so consider it when deciding on a Breakfast caterer, it's a great choice that the office will love.",

By the time I got home, the biscuit was a bit on the hard side which is contrary to the warm, soft, flaky goodness I was expecting. I have to give this place 3 stars for now.

The place was packed out the door. So considering the amount of people waiting for a seat, the wait time was actually not bad. Service is quick and efficient but understandably they have no time for chitchat.  I am from Texas, so although our southern BBQ is kick ass, I don't believe there is expertise in making proper grits. It's always been bland, pale,and well, gritty. I had to know what the fuss is about! I got the shrimp and grits with biscuit. Ermagerd, I am now enlightened to the Southern pride associated with grits done right. It was creamy,smooth, and rich without being heavy at all. And no grittiness! I could taste a touch of butter and cheese, but it was the perfect balance to still keep me shoveling in for another heaping spoon. The tomato topping left little pools of oil which I scooped aside, but the shrimp was also done well. Shrimp is so often overlooked, but these remained juicy and tender. And the biscuit was yet another ermagerd moment. Its denseness was along the lines of a scone, but it somehow was fluffy and airy and so moist. Tearing it open is a thing of joy. The edges had a nice crisp and was lightly buttery. Only odd thing to me is it was sprinkled with sugar for a savory dish. But that could easily be scraped off. These were actually finger lickin' good. Next time I'm in town, I have my eye on the pot pie.",

Once inside, we were greeted by a handsome waiter, very efficient service, plenty of refills, very attentive service. Biscuit was huge. A little lackluster on the oatmeal pancake but the peach compote was yummy. Love the grits. I have enjoyed my visit. Between Peace and Hominy and Flying Biscuit in Charlotte and the Plucked Up Chicken in Columbus, Georgia,  I have eaten well in some Zany named food spots. Love a catchy name and the foods met their mark each place.",

Tupelo wins on hashbrowns, on bacon and on french toast...it's a tie for biscuits.  I'll give them this  Flying Biscuit does a really good biscuit.  It'd be criminal if the biscuit sucked.

Both times I have been here we've been lucky enough to not have to wait and have always been greeted with great service. One huge downside in my opinion, they don't have a liquor license. No Bloody's, Mimosas or spiked espressos here, folk. Unfortunately, I've forgotten this tidbit and have been disappointed upon arrival twice.  Moving on, the food is great and they have a menu that caters to those looking to indulge in an artery-clogging 3000 calorie meal and for those that are looking for something a little lighter. I love this mix of traditional and a little more out-of-box options.  Oatmeal pancakes were scrumptious. Fluffy and hearty but light enough that I didn't feel like I needed to be rolled out of the place. The creamy dreamy grits are appropriately named and the whole wheat french toast was impressive as well. The only thing I wasn't excited about were the moon dusted potatoes which are cubed too large and not crispy enough for my subjective taste.  Personally, I prefer the biscuits at Tupelo Honey.... yes, yes I know. But overall this place is A-Ok. Need to return and get the fried green tomato BLT soon!",

We arrived around 9:45 am, had about a 30 min wait for a table (which is to be expected for a Sunday morning). After being seated our waitress quickly took our drink orders but after that we didn't receive our drinks for another 15 mins. After waiting an hour for a food it was served to us cold and I was given the wrong order. Normally I would not make a fuss about a wrong order but the food given to me contained items I was allergic too. Now having to get my meal replaced I had to wait another 30 mins for my meal. By this time it's 12:00pm and I am starving. Overall I did not have a good experience at this establishment and probably will not be returning. The only reason I am giving them 3 stars instead of 2 is because our waitress was extremely helpful, informative, and tried her hardest to make sure the meal was right the second time.",

That's what gives it that character you expect to see in a chain restaurant. Then again, I just said it was a chain. And like most chains, the food is a hit and a miss, depending on the day and the employee on duty. This is \"family owned,\" but it's a chain, folks.  I've been here three times for lunch. The prices are decent for the food I'm getting, but nothing really urged me to come back. And that's something I won't be doing for a good while. Now, before I continue, I went here for lunch, but wanted to try their all day menu items. It should be safe, right? Hmm...no.   We went in and had great service from the start. There is NOTHING wrong with their service. Our server was probably one of the BEST I've seen in a long time. Ordered our food and got some biscuits while we waited. Love the biscuits though. Not too flaky or doughy. Just the right mixture for my tastes.   I ordered the Bacon and Egg combo with potatoes as my side. When it came out, I thought it was joke. It was literally two eggs fried, burnt bacon that had the consistency of an icicle, and a scoop of seasoned potatoes. Nothing special at all. What was worse? I paid nearly $8.50 for this! Are you kidding me. I would've gone to Waffle House and got twice as much and just the same quality if not BETTER. The other meals that I've gotten here aren't too bad, but still run along the lines of mediocre Southern dining to me. And it seems overpriced for the quality of food you expect to deserve.  I'm disappointed. If this is what \"Southern dining\" is, then you can keep it until you prove me otherwise.",

While I liked the flavor of the chicken sausage gravy, my dad didn't and then complained of the taste \"revisiting\" until lunchtime.  Neither one of us liked the biscuits at all, which is odd since the name of the joint is Biscuit Cafe.  They state you can order toast instead of the biscuit ... so will do that next time.

I got there first after unsuccessfully navigating the parking lot (it can be confusing), and was seated in a booth near the back. The waitress came up and asked what I would like to drink. Knowing what we both wanted to eat I ordered our food as well.   I don't think it took 5 minutes to get our food. Right as my friend sat down it was coming out of the kitchen and being placed on the table. It was wonderful. I got the biscuits and gravy. It's chicken gravy, so I was a little hesitant, but the texture is that of sausage and it was very good! The biscuit is dense and you only really need one biscuit. I couldn't even finish that. You can get just the biscuit or you can get it with eggs and grits. The waitress kindly told me that they were big biscuits, so I just went with that and I'm glad she did.   Since I didn't see the biscuits and gravy on the menu I didn't know how much they cost, but I wasn't worried because they are not usually expensive. When I got the bill, I was surprised. Only $2.99! What a deal! Not only was it cheaper than Chick Fil A it was faster too! We will definitely be back here, I think this is our new lunch spot.",
