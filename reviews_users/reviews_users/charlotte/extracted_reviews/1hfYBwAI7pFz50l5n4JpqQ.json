The owners are super nice and you can tell they put blood, sweat and tears into making this place something special. They go the extra mile - like slicing meat and cheese fresh for each sandwich they make. They are also the only place in Charlotte I've found that cuts meats and cheeses the way they do in delis up north - nice and thin. Excited to watch them grow and hopefully add even more selection.",

They have daily specials for their sandwiches, which are usually really interesting combinations of fresh meats and gourmet touches.  You can also build your own sandwich, of course, and they're really open to suggestions for things to add to the menu. Their selection of chips and snacks is also killer, and don't forget to ask for a pickle with your food! So juicy.",

It's in an old strip mall which is vacant aside from this establishment. Their sign isn't super noticeable so you need to look hard for the banner above the door. The interior has a good amount of seating with sixish beers on draft, coolers with refreshments, and shelves holding wine, chips, and other random household supplies like toilet paper.   I have yet to have a sandwich that I didn't like. I usually get one of the daily specials and my wife goes for the caprese. The deviled eggs are a nice side as well. They have grilled options and cold options. I'm not sure who designs the sandwich ingredient combinations but I've always been impressed with the flavor. One time I got a crab cake banh mi that was to die for. I'm not even sure how it was only $10 with the amount of crab on the sandwich.   They've started serving breakfast as well. I've gotten the southern biscuit breakfast sandwich with a runny egg and jalapeno bacon. Needless to say it was great. The avocado toast is very good as well.   I'll keep coming back time and time again to try their new flavors and explore the breakfast menu.",

That's too bad 'cause they're similar to Common Market which rocks it out.  I would rank then as good with lots of headroom to become great.  Plan on 10 minutes for them to make your sandwich, even when not busy.  A great concept in a growing area.  If I lived nearby it would be a place I'd hang out.  Reasonable prices and credit cards accepted.",

    "text": "It's kind of weird that it took the bodega to move for the wife and I to actually stop in for a sandwich. We had stopped in a few times before but only to buy a few supplies that we needed. Anyway, it's great that they have moved and essentially expanding into a larger space. Also the fact that they moved into the previously abandoned retail place on 36th street bodes well for other businesses to move into the adjacent spaces.  I think that they have expanded the menu a little and it may still be a work in progress. Either way, I love me a good sandwich and I chose the shrimp po' boy and the wife got a veggie sandwich this go around. The veggies in the wife's sandwich were fresh and flavorful, a really good combo. My po' boy was overflowing with shrimp and they were pipping hot. Flavor was good as well, and my only gripe would be the bread could have been better and a True crusty baguette would have been ideal and more authentic. I am a self confessed bread snob and firmly believe that the bread makes or breaks a sandwich. Ultimately, my love of all things sandwich will have me returning here often.",

The building looks a bit sketchy from the outside, but once inside it's quite pleasant.  The only caveat I have to add is that they have a limited menu and always have a lot of daily specials running. This is great because it can add variety, but it really sucks when you find a \"favorite\" and then aren't able to have it again.",

Usually a bunch of ingredients that make you say \"hmm that could work.\" The first time we thought about going we never went in because we thought we weren't looking for something that casual, but they actually have a really nice setup in there! Plenty of tables and chairs, bar seating, and beer on tap.   After seeing the Sunday crowds out for brunch and not wanting to deal with that, we headed to Noda Bodega after seeing they were featuring a VA ham, pimento cheese, tomato and fried egg sandwich on pressed sourdough. We picked out a bag of chips to share and some bottled iced teas. The sandwich was really good and I appreciated being able to get in and out after enjoying a breakfast sandwich that was a little different.  Can't wait to go back and try something for lunch or dinner!",

My wife and I were planning a backyard wedding at our home in NoDa and explored many options from food trucks to your more conventional catering companies who only specialize in that market. We had so many options but none of them made us feel as comfortable as Brian and Lisa did when we found out they offered catering.   They were amazing to work with, walking us through all of our options and were extremely flexible with how the menu would appear. Brian came to the table (pun intended) with beautiful suggestions based on our budget and Lisa was there every step of the way with all of the details we would have never thought of for our specific needs. Let me just tell you, we had more compliments on the food at our wedding than anything else! Our menu consisted of butternut squash soup with pumpkin seeds, sweet tea brined chicken, stuffed pork loin, potatoes au gratin, bacon brussels sprouts, and they helped us create two specialty drinks to be served to our guests. Our wedding was in November and it was the perfect menu for a beautiful fall evening.   They were more than just a catering service, they provided recommendations on flowers, tableware, furniture, servingware, and even photographers, bands, and DJs. Brian and Lisa have a wealth of knowledge when it comes to finding vendors and solutions for some of the nuances of your event, as they have been active in this industry for years.    Above everything else, they were great friends and people to lean on when they could tell we were getting a little stressed out as the days counted down to the big day. We live right around the corner from Bodega, and while they were always welcoming to us, when I see them now it feels like family. I'm sure I am leaving out many details that made this such a perfect day and experience that my wife and I will cherish forever, but all I can tell you is choosing Noda Bodega as our catering was the best choice we could have ever made.",

I was a first timer to the Bodega, and it was WAY bigger inside than I anticipated, which is a plus. Decent size bar and several tables inside. The price for food matched the quality in my opinion (which was amazing), but the beers on draft were a bit pricey (oh how it hurts my feelings to pay 6 bucks for a pint when the same 6 pack is in the cooler for 10 or 11 bucks...le sigh.)  I will absolutely come back here for a meal and a beer before a night out...or a day out...but I definitely wont be doing any serious drinking here due to prices. If they have a draft special night I'm all over it though. Good vibes. Highly recommend.",

Great, friendly staff that is dedicated to serving up high quality sandwiches in a relaxing, but very simple atmosphere.  We plopped down on a couch and ate off the coffee table.   I had the Italian Stallion and my guest had  the ham and cheese.  Outstanding flavors in both.  The Bodega will be a definite stop next time I'm back in town.",

So grilled cheese & Italian meats-y.  I have had the delight of trying both a grilled cheese special with a Mediterranean twist and the Son of a Stallion. Both were amazing. The bread is crisp but not dry and all of the deli meats were super fresh. Add to that the fact that the owners are down to earth and the fact that they stock some pretty killer chips, drinks and beers, and you have the recipe for win.   Oh and did i mention it's in NoDa but it has parking?!  I did?  Good.",

    "text": "Delicious sandwich heaven.   I'm still trying to wrap my head around the actual store - which was still fairly empty. They have beer and wine (chilled and room temp), a small pre-made food selection (heat&eat lasagna, pimento cheese), drinks, a small deli, and two racks offering toilet paper and chips alongside pancake mix, olive oils, and higher end canned items. I'm guessing they'll be filling in the gaps in the future?   But, back to the deli. I ordered the ham & cheese, and my sister ordered the caprese (very similar except mine has the addition of prosciutto). Everything was sliced right in front of us, and then thrown on a panini press. As we were waiting we noticed the crunch berries bar, and knew we had to try it out. (Apparently they're experimenting with lots of breakfast cereals, and I'd stop in just to see what they were working on next.) There were only a few chairs and one table, which were occupied, so we hit the road with our sandwiches. When we did dig in, holy crap, salty explosion of tastiness (that went oh so well with a beer). prosciutto, pesto, mozzarella, tomato... definitely my kind of ham and cheese! Even the salads (which can be made into wraps if you wish) sounded really good.  I will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches (the special at the time was deviled egg salad with ham on wheat - kinda hoping that'll still be available). Great for picking one up on the go, especially if you're hitting up a brewery or the park. And they also had party platters you could order.",

    "text": "As far as sandwich bodegas go, Noda Bodega is the best in the neighborhood.  I was never in their previous location, but their current one is pretty great.  Here's what's pretty cool about Noda Bodega:  1. Sandwiches.  Oh the Sandwiches.  They are so delicious!  You can go boring and just get what you want, but I highly recommend ordering one of their creations off of the menu.  I'm recently digging the turkey reuben with Turkey and homemade vinegar-based slaw toasted on delicious bread.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...  2. Specials.  Noda Bodega rotates their sandwich specials and posts them on Facebook in case you're thinking about wondering in to try something new.  They also have weekly specials on the board.  3. Small but great selection.  There isn't a huge drink selection, but what they have is pretty darn good.  Their chip selection is always stocked with really cool flavors.  4. It's clean and there's a place to sit.  I know this sounds silly, but I'm a little judgey when it comes to restaurants and cleanliness.  They have lots of mis-matched old furniture to contribute to the casual vibe, but it's not gross.  Overall, great place to grab a sandwich and a bevvie!",

My boyfriend introduced me to the Noda Bodega, and now I wouldn't go anywhere else if I'm looking for a quick bite to eat!  Fast service, super friendly, and they can accommodate any order.  You can sit in and eat or take out (I usually have my dog with me so I take out) - it'd be nice if they had seating outside though.  They do sell wine by the bottle which is a good plus.",

    "text": "Maybe they were having an \"off\" day, but hey, if you have a business, you have a business, and an off day is no excuse for a bad experience for your customers. We got there around lunch-time on a Saturday, and the wait to order was over 10 minutes, standing near the crowded counter. The food was overpriced. The girl at the counter was nice enough. Went out to eat with my wife on back patio, which is nice if you have a dog, which we did. As I'm walking back inside the waitress kicks the door to get my attention, which is rude, but I'm polite so I go back and hold open the door for her because she has a couple plates in her hands. She ignores me and speaks with someone else while I'm standing there holding open the door for like ten seconds. Then she spins arounds and spills all of her plates, getting ketchup and food all over my pants and shoes. ZERO acknowledgement or apology. Instead she says \"I got it\", very rudely. Sandwiches come out almost 30 minutes later, and they got the order wrong, and had to remake it. A family near us had to complain too because they never ended up getting the plates of food that the waitress dropped onto the deck. And a group of three friends who were literally right behind me in line still hadn't gotten their food when we left, like 45 minutes after they ordered. We're talking sandwiches, here. The sandwiches were okay, like 3/5 stars. Again, maybe the waitress was having a bad day, and someone in the kitchen called in sick so the orders were coming out wrong, but the point of yelp is give honest reviews, so there it is.",

At first it was a little hard for me to get used to a sandwich that wasn't a sub, so is was just getting the peanut butter and jelly. Don't get the peanut butter and jelly. It will give you the wrong impression. The Italian station is my favorite. If you like pizza you'll like this. It doesn't taste like pizza but it has the same heavy Italian influence some pizza tries to create. It is really good. The sandwiches come out fast. Really great place overall.

Honestly, I didn't taste much of the jalapeno but other than that the sandwich was great. It was the perfect size and very neat. Also, this place has cold brew on tap which is always a plus. I'm not giving it 5 stars because the wait was extremely long but that could be attributed to the fact that it was a Sunday morning.

It was very good. It was served on grilled and pressed  baguette, which I liked, and included jalapeno as an unexpected ingredient. Hard to beat for $8. The woman behind the counter, I think the owner, seemed very nice as well, talking to all of the customers. This shop is not marked very well from the street. At least that's my excuse for missing it the first time by. But it's worth finding. Recommended.",

I opted for a can of Dr. Browns, a bag of Route 11 chips and a sandwich they call \"Afternoon Delight\" which was a spiced turkey with cheese and avocado and tomato in a panini press.

In total I ordered 2 Reubens one kids sandwich and a small house salad for $29. I am not cheap when it comes to good food but I felt it wasn't worth it.  The staff was really friendly and the restaurant was pretty busy while I was there. The parking lot was almost full. I might give their breakfast options a try one day being that it's pretty close to where I live.",

    "text": "The only reason why this isn't 5 stars is because I know that they can have more atmosphere than I experienced - and that's no fault of their own, it just means that I need to come back around peak time and update my review!  The new location (not that I visited the old location) is kind of hidden away in a strip mall that looks like it should have a lot more development than it does. The Lady and I showed up around 3:00 to get a very late lunch, and naturally, the place was pretty dead. We were helped right away and after looking at the menu, I went with a ham and cheese sandwich and The Lady went with a Green Goddess type sandwich. We took our number and headed out to the back patio because why not try to get a little sun? The back patio is kind of rough, as it backs up to woods, but every table is equipped with an umbrella which is nice for hot days. Our food came out quickly and MAN was I blown away by the quality of the ingredients. You'd think a ham and cheese panini would be relatively simple, but the freshness of the ingredients and the way that they were prepared show finesse and care in the kitchen. Needless to say the sandwich was gone quickly. The Lady enjoyed hers thoroughly too, I didn't even get to try it :(   We'll absolutely be back to try some more of their offerings - they have some really creative options and it's all at an affordable price point.   A few more things: 1) The whole place has an urban market type feel, with coolers for beer, local provisions and snacks, and other fun things to look at throughout the space. 2) The beer selection is impressive, to put it mildly. Lots of rare and unique things, fun treats to try from all over the US. Anyways, we're looking forward to returning and feeling the vibe of the neighborhood along with a well crafted sandwich!",

Not that I had anything against the place, I just didn't know what they had to offer.  However, at the recommendation of some buddies that live in NODA, I decided to see what the fuss was all about.  Here's all the Info you need about NODA Bodega...  Parking:  One of the most appealing and probably underrated aspects of NODA Bodega is that it has its own parking lot!  I know this might not sound like a big deal, but if you live or go out in the NODA area, you know how crucial this is.  Don't get me wrong, I love to Uber, ride-share, walk and bike as much as the next person, however sometimes you just want to drive up to a spot, park, get out of your car and walk in.  You can do that here at NODA Bodega.    Food:  I've only been here a few times, so I'm, not super well-versed on the menu just yet, but I can vouch for breakfast, particularly the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.  It was cooked to gooey, morning perfection (see pics).  Tater-tots are good.  They are cooked fresh to order and are served crisp and piping hot.  Don't forget about the Grits.  I'd heard a lot about the grits here and can def vouch for their legitimacy.  Served hot and cheesy you simply can't go wrong with the grits.    Service/Ambiance:  Service is super-friendly.  I've never had any issues with my order.  Although sometimes it can take some time for your food to be served, its usually never super long (thats what SHE SAID -  HAHA!).   Everyone I've interacted with there has been super chill yet professional - which is exactly what I'm looking for.  Aside from the service, I really love the custom art they have on sale/display.  The artwork is always captivating and usually represents the city in some unique way.       After now having been to NODA Bodega twice, my vision is clear, I see exactly what everyone's been clamoring about...great sandwiches, local beers on draft, great service, and an establishment in NODA that actually has its own parking lot, how can you go wrong?!?",

When you enter, you're greeted by a large board with the specials and a deli case. There's also a counter bar where you can pull up a seat and eat.  There are also racks stacked with your essentials. Ya know candy, chips, and toilet paper. At the edge of the store, there's a large refrigerated case stocked with craft beers, some domestic favorites, and bottles of wine. They also have craft beers on tap  In case, you have trouble making a decision while in-store, be sure to check their FB page beforehand! They post/share their daily specials. They also serve breakfast pretty much all day on Sundays so you can pop in for a hearty breakfast sandwich during the afternoon should your booze-soaked Saturday night cause you to sleep in.  I got to quickly chat with the owner and she was very sweet and personally recommended the brisket tacos (of which I ordered). I placed my to-go order for the tacos and a \"that next level rasta\" sandwich which were both ready quite quickly. The recipient of the rasta sandwich gave it very high praises. Personally, I found the brisket in the tacos a little tough but still all right, overall. I see myself frequenting the bodega quite a bit in the future!",

As much as I loved the their old, cozy location, this space is just so much better. It's bigger, there's more seating, and it's easier to park. I love the long counter. I typically do take out, but will always sit here if I'm staying.  Along with their regular menu, they always have different specials every day. Check their Facebook page, they always post them along with descriptions and pictures. Fridays they always have the G-Wich (london broil, three pepper cheese, jalapeno bacon), named in honor of my old roommate. Hi Greg. My favorite regular menu item here is the Greek salad. It's one of my favorite salads in Charlotte. I think it's the peppadew peppers that do it for me. The reuben and the Italian Stallion are both also great. I don't really think you can go wrong with anything here. Couple weeks ago, they did a chile relleno stuffed with sweet potatoes and over grits. Holy. Ridiculously delicious. They've also got a great selection of wine and beer. There's also a few drafts.   NoDa Bodega also landed at #9 on Yelp's 2016 Top 50 Places to Eat in Charlotte list. Huge congrats to them, love seeing spots like this getting much deserved recognition. Congrats!",

I usually walk in with something in mind, but I'm always drawn in by the daily specials.  They are so unique and an I am never disappointed!    They have a variety of ships and sundries to choose from, local beers on tap and in the bottle/can, ample seating, a bar, TV, WiFi, etc.  The old location was in an old house and was rather quaint with the decor of a quirky coffeehouse.  The new location isn't the least bit ostentatious, but once inside you'll see the space works well for them and has given them the ability to spread out and offer more seating.  It also offers better access from a main road and has a private parking lot.  It is a bit further away from the area most people know as NoDa, but it's really only a few blocks further away.  The daily special can be found on their Facebook page.  Be sure to check it out.  It has become one of my Charlotte favs for sure!  In fact, I think I just decided where I'll be heading for lunch today!",

    "text": "I have a confession: I went to the Bodega and had a serious emotional moment over a sandwich. I'm not exaggerating! I can actually tell you the last time that this happened. Years ago, there was an amazing deli in Statesville, NC that I went to 2-3 times a week. The day that place closed down was a solemn day for me. I hadn't found a place to fill that sandwich void in my life until the Yelp Charlotte Top 100 list brought me to NoDa Bodega.  Considering I've been a North Charlotte guy all my life, I have no clue why I've never found this place on my own. The Bodega is a quintessential neighborhood spot that's part bar, part deli, and part provisions. Craft beer can be found both on draft and in cans in the cooler. The seating is spacious and plentiful inside and out, and everything I saw on my visit was squeaky clean. If you like the Common Market vibe, you'll love this place as well.  Both trips to NoDa bodega resulted in ordering the same sandwich because it was that damn good: The Italian Stallion. Starting with the baguette that had a notable richness and the perfect amount of chew. The trio of meats consisted of proscuitto, finocchiona, coppa. All three meats are similar to each other but they all bring something different. Finocchiona delivers such a bold profile with strong notes of fennel and peppers that compliments the fresh basil. The saltiness of the prosciutto is cut with the mozzarella. And the fatty coppa pairs so well with the crusty baguette. Top all of this richness with a crisp and fresh peppadew relish and you've got me for life.  I'm sure I'll get to the rest of the menu eventually, but it's going to be difficult on my next visit to get anything other than this. I think I've made it clear: First Visit? GET THE ITALIAN STALLION! Don't be surprised if you see me when you're there, I've got to make up for lost time.",

    "text": "TL/DR: Many of the reviews say Noda Bodega serves the best sandwich that they've ever eaten. Did I feel the same? Nope.   Englishman James on my Garmin said turn left, although I didn't see any street side signage. Eventually, I saw Noda Bodega on their front door and pulled into the parking lot.   I got there at about 10:50 a.m. on Friday, 8/02/2019.   I walked up to the register to order and the young lady basically said, \"what do YOU want?\" Not the nicest welcome that I've ever experienced.   I ordered the Italian Stallion, due to the sandwich being highly recommended. It seemed like a no-brainer to me.   Debbie Downer continued to vex me by saying, \"I don't know if we're serving lunch yet.\" Sister, if you're not serving lunch by 11:00 a.m. then there's something wrong. Sheesh!  I ordered some \"Spicy Cajun Crawtators\" Zapp's chips and a fountain Coke. If you aren't familiar with Zapp's chips you need to give these a try. They're from Louisiana and they're fantastic. I consider them the Ben & Jerry's of the potato chip world. The fact that these chips were available added one star to this review. Spoiler alert: I liked the chips better than the sandwich.  I took a seat at a two top table with these little playtime metal chairs. Larger four top tables had old red/white 50's style chairs that would have been more comfortable, but I didn't want to occupy a larger table by myself. (I make an effort to be considerate, most of the time.)  My sandwich took a good fifteen minutes to arrive...even though there were only about three people in the deli, and my order was second in line. I finished one cup of soda and had to go back for a refill before my food came. After my food was brought to me I had no further interaction with the employees. (Thank goodness.)  The Italian Stallion, 2.5/5.  My apologies to everyone else who thinks that the Italian Stallion is a five star sandwich. I just wasn't feeling it. To begin with the sandwich didn't have a whole lot of meat on it. Secondly, after being pressed the sandwich was only about a half inch thick, and the bread was hard and dry. I've had better sandwiches in NODA, and just about anywhere else.  Zapp's chips. 5/5 See above comments. Fantastic!  Fountain sodas, 4/5. Aw'ight. A Coke's a Coke.   Since I was fairly early there was adequate parking.   The deli had a pretty decent laid back feel, which I liked. I can see the potential here. Based on the thousands of apartments being build close by - this place should do well.   Sano rating was: 96.5% <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.cdpehs.com%2FNCENVPBL%2FINSPECTION%2FShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx%3FESTABLISHMENT%3D173943%26esttst_cty%3D60&s=08db81fc5ebf243bfd1bcf3e859eb6e7c2ef69f0fbec80559ebea15b86485f27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">public.cdpehs.com/NCENVP...</a>  There was an ice cream freezer next to the entrance, wine for sale along the right wall, and craft beers on the left side of the entrance. There were a ton of potato chip options, which kept this from being a two star review.   There were paintings for sale next to my table priced from $45 to $85.   My total bill was: $12.xx.   Maybe I would have liked the Reuben or Cuban sandwich better. Maybe those would have been more substantial offerings. Maybe I shouldn't have driven to Charlotte to eat a sandwich.   BTW, Hatch Sandwich Bar in Hickory kicks this place's arse in both food and service.   PS: Dessert was a salted caramel brownie from Amelie's, which was fantastic.",

We opted to try both of the specials--The Basic Wild and G-Man's G-Wich. We added prosciutto to The Basic Wild. Both were pretty good, but I liked G-Man's G-Wich more. It had more flavors and depth to it.   We added a side of tots and bacon ranch potato salad both of which were great.   If you're looking for some solid deli sandwiches in Noda, this is your place.",

I'm likely not ordering the right sandwiches but then again, their menu is pretty limited. This trip I ordered the chicken melt which my brain said would be a chicken breast with melted cheese. I failed to see in the description that it was chicken salad. So my fault, but read the fine print.   They seem to have some expediting problems. The young woman at the cash register couldn't seem to manage a growing line plus getting the orders to the folks waiting. The (I presume) owner was attending to something facility related and didn't jump in the help with the backlog (she pretty much ignored what was going on.)",

This easy going bodega is a solid pick when you need to stop for lunch or a beer. Friendly staff, awesome menu, and good beers on tap. The vibe is super casual, approachable, and I stop here regularly while I'm running around for work. I've never been disappointed, and as a picky eater I usually slice up all of the sandwich options - here, I don't change anything. The Italian Stallion is so good, and a delicious balance of flavors. Please order it. Support NoDa Bodega.   The location is a little hard to find, as there's no large signage, but slow down when you get close to Ink Floyd - the google satellite images are old. Don't trust them! If you hit the light, you've gone too far. And again, order the Italian Stallion. Thank me later.",

There is no signage that I saw except by the entrance of the restaurant itself.  So just park and it is in the middle of the mall.  You order at the counter and pay and they give you a numbered stand that you place on your table.  They bring out the food when it is ready.  The sandwich was just the right size and came with a pickle spear.  Most of the clientel were in the 20-30 age range when I was there.  I plan to go back someday.",

    "text": "Noda Bodega - Has an Italian Sandwich every Northern in the South should eat. It feels and smells like home. This review is primarily for the Italian Stallion sandwich .  Bodega has many amazing offerings on their menu - but right now .. lets focus on the absolute genius that went into the preparation of this sandwich.  First- it takes forever- so it forces you to remain in the store, talking to strangers and getting to know your neighbors... like back in the north.  The sandwich comes on butcher paper and has that authentic oil and vinegar stain that lights up your heart.  And Peppadew relish on a baguette... !!  I truly enjoy being in the restaurant. its a good size and can welcome the conversation you want by sitting at the bar or gives you the privacy of tables tucked in to the corner. Its really a fantastic place with an awesome northern staple sandwich and I just love it.",

I waited for 40 minutes. The front of house was desperately overwhelmed and needs an expediter/runner to make sure food goes out when it's ready. I watched sandwiches sit for 3-5 minutes before the woman working the cashier could get away to run them to the tables or call the names of the to go orders.   I was prepared to wait...but the guy who was in line behind me asked the cashier how long his sandwich his would take. The cashier had the line expedite his sandwich. His sandwich was ready before mine and and several folks who were ahead of me.  This is inconsiderate of your customers and bad customer service. His time is not more valuable than ours. I get it's the lunch rush. I get that there wasn't enough staff. This was a bad move, though.   I'll keep my visits to off peak hours. Or I'll hit up Deli St, Laurel Market, Local Loaf, or Chris's Deli.",

Tucked back off The Plaza, kinda near the Food Lion, you wouldn't expect to turn the corner and see a modern, recently remodeled shopping strip with an urban market in it, but here it is! They have beer/cider/kombucha on tap, bottle and cans in a fridge, shelves of chips and snacks, and a full menu of sandwiches and salads.   I ordered a pineapple cider and went for the Ivy's Green Goddess Grilled Cheese, which has pesto, mozzarella, goat cheese, avocado, and spinach all pressed together like a panini. It was perfectly toasted and a HUGE sandwich. I probably shouldn't have eaten all of it, but I did. It also came with a pickle.   The space is also pretty cool. Inside there's a bar area and a good number of tables. They also have a pinball machine. But outside is where it's at. They have a fenced in patio that feels very secluded. It's got market lights and big colorful umbrellas and they had some great alternative rock playing. I could definitely hang out there again on a summer afternoon :)",

Not to mention, the daily special names are Charlotte related and they're quite unique. They sell an wide variety of lunch add ons like Zappa's chips and kettle chips of many varieties.   The service here is absolutely astounding. The young man and lady manning the front counter helped me with ordering and they were so helpful to call my phone for me and help me find it because I dropped it in my car. Definitely will continue to eat here :)",

I can't lie, I preferred that location so much more because it was just so quaint.  Even though it's moved to a slightly sketchier location down the road, I'll still give it 5 stars because it's THAT good.  These sandwiches are mother f'ing incredible.  They usually have 5-8 standards which are all great, but then they'll have specials which are always great too.  I think my favorite would be the bodega reuben- those mustard seeds in that homemade slaw?!  Are you kidding?!  Incredible.  Their homemade sides in the case are excellent too- i personally recommend the greek pasta salad and hummus (yummus).  Plus they have a great beer selection in the fridge.  I know they changed locations so they could serve alcohol/obtain a liquor license so I get why they moved, but I still kind of miss the nostalgia of the old place.  Doesn't matter though, as long as this place is still serving up their top notch sammies, they'll always get 5 stars from me.",

The blue house on the corner turned restaurant was very clean inside, had nice music playing, and a high food score posted on the wall. The vey helpful friendly staff had good advice on choosing a sandwich and made changes to a sandwich for us without making faces.  Sandwiches and Greek Salad ordered and we sat waiting at a 1950 style Formica kitchen table and chair set to eat! Sandwiches arrived wrapped in brown paper complete with a pickle spear on the side, so so so delicious! Greek Salad was beautifully arranged lettuce tomatoes  olives arti hearts and hummus on crustini bread ! Would I go back...YES! If you are nearby stop in for a bite!",

Plus, the new decor is perfect - lots of space, clean, and it has a real \"New England\" grocery feel to it, which is great. Makes living in this neighborhood even better!",

We were still early for lunch rush, about 11:30a so parking was not an issue. If you go during super busy times drive around for street parking.  We had three in our party and after we ordered the food was ready in about 10 minutes. 1) The Italian stallion sandwich. High quality meats that were heated with great authentic Italian sub flavors. Recommended!!!! 2) The club sandwich. The bread was toasted and fresh with the same high quality sliced to order meats.  We even made an ingredient change on this due to dietary restrictions and the staff was super accommodating.  Delicious !!!!! 3) The Greek salad. OH MY FLAVORS. This was amazing. So so so fresh. Loaded with tomatoes, olives, feta, artichoke hearts. The dressing was a really tangy mustardy vinaigrette and complemented the salad perfectly.  We all agreed that we would come back here again when in the area.  Health score was 98 if you look for that.  Store was really clean.  Staff was so friendly and chill.  This made our Saturday trip to Charlotte that much better. Thanks!!!!",

They have a variety of house sandwiches and salads as well as awesome daily specials like the Rasta Mon, and G-Man's G-Wich. The ingredients are always fresh and the dressings and sauces are made in house as well as the egg and chicken salads.  Seating is limited so 95% of orders are to go. They have a variety of juices, kombucha, sodas, and even popsicles and such for those super hot days. They also sell random last minute things for party purposes such as toilet paper, cigarettes, white owls, tylenol, etc.   Beers! Man they have a great selection of local and regional beers. The only problem is you can't drink alcohol on site which would make this place way bad ass. Bodega has been a staple in NoDa for a solid 2 years or so and now they are making the move up the street to 36th where they are expanding, going to have tons more options for seating including an outdoor patio, and they will be serving alcohol on draft!",

The only thing about The Bodega that I find to be a hassle is how slow they are at making sandwiches. Granted I've only been here twice (and will certainly be back) but each time it has been super-slow. I'm not usually one to complain about this but for some reason I can never understand what is actually happening behind the counter that is slowing things down so much. Note however that I still gave this place five stars! The sandwiches are one of those things you say are \"worth the wait\" believe it or not!  Both experiences I've had so far have resulted in awesomely delicious sandwiches that I'm not sure I'd be able to nail if I attempted to make them at home. That's one of the things great about The Bodega. The sandwiches I've had here are the kind I wouldn't make at home and for that, it is certainly worth the trip. The ingredients are super-fresh and each sandwich I've had were super-flavorful with great sauces and combination of ingredients.  If you're looking for one of the better sandwiches in town and aren't in a rush to get in and out, I highly recommend.",

    "text": "Sure. The Bodega may not be on the main strip alongside the rest of the NoDa greats, but this neighborhood gem packs a walloping punch for those craving local biz feel, love, product, and aesthetic. The simple and understated.....perhaps reonvated \"house,\" takes shape as a cafe/deli/oddly laid out diamond in the rough. Thrilled to check it out after catching wind of the sandwich special of the day.   We walked up and ordered the caprese sandwich and the Mr. G...or Super G...something like that. Only drawback from this visit was attention from the staff. Not a huge deal, but it was a little difficult to get a word out of them, or even get them to pay attention to the fact we were trying to order.   The caprese was perfect. Loved the bread it was on and the mozz, basil, and balsamic were top notch. Nice touch with the tomato spread, too. The sandwich I ordered was just ridiculous. London broil, jalapeno bacon, balsamic reduction and a few other nice accoutrement to enhance texture. Needless to say, it was a mammoth sandwich. Check out my photo. Only downside was when it was all gone, haha.   I'm very much looking forward to heading back to The Bodega. Great sandwiches and selection of other items, too. Cheers!",
