The guys are really friendly, and they learned my name after a few visits. I never had to order...they just started cooking. It's a small, family-owned business, and they seem to be doing well...especially to be in such a hidden location off the beaten path.

I've seen some other comments about the bread--I love bread, but the filling is more important. I had the Supreme sub, with steak, mushrooms, cheese, and sauce, and it was so flavorful. Best of all, you can get a great sub for an extremely reasonable price.   The building itself is nothing fancy--but that's not a complaint. It's very simple, what some might call a \"hole-in-the-wall\" but it is so comfortably non-assuming and salt-of-the-earth. Parking is easy.

When entering this establishment with my girlfriend, we thought based on reviews alone; we could grab a quick Sunday sub/sandwich. As we entered, we did not receive any acknowledgment for about ten minutes. He then spoke without looking at us, \"be with you in in a few minutes\" (if I can recall). So we waited a bit longer, there were two other people in the place, and none of them had their sandwiches yet, he was still getting his stuff together and the only employee there. I have no idea why he was slower than molasses, but it's a shame a small local place like this won't be able to stay in business for much longer.   We left after twenty plus minutes because we haven't even given him our order yet, and I was starving. There luckily was a Subway up the street.",

The vegetarian is so good it makes you question if you are eating meat.    I will keep going back and the staff there is great.",

It's a family owned and operated business so the atmosphere is very personal but it still feels professional.   My only tip is order ahead if you're in a rush because everything is made to order and perfection takes time.",

I decided to order a basic turkey and cheese sub with lettuce, tomato, onion, salt/pepper, and mayo. I got it toasted and they even sauteed the meat. Within 5 minutes my sub was ready. I couldn't believe the size of it - maybe 8\" - and walked out of there with two subs and bag of chips for just around 10 bucks.   The flavor was great and the sub was stuffed with fillings. In addition, the bread was lightly toasted and soft on the inside. I was really impressed as it was more flavorful tasting than what my basic order requested. It was great!   As I waited for my sub you could tell that Sub One is a local joint full of regulars - the staff behind the counter personally greeted almost everyone who walked in.  I'm glad I checked this place out! Places like this always remind me that you should never judge a book by its cover - and always give local places in your community a try!",

    "text": "Yum Yum Yum. Sub One has hit the mark. The menu is basic and simple-  You order by number and wait as the send of cooking beef and onion spice fill your lungs. I literally love this place. I am always a tad bit elitist when it comes to subs or hoagies-( the jersey native in me) I was of course skeptical about the whole concept of CLT somehow getting the sub correct.   Babay - I was wrong. This little joint was super quaint and charming. My sandwish :) was delicious and juicy. The staff was extremely friendly - but did not have any time for my NJ shenanigans... (pretty such enuff tools have visited them already :) )  My coworkers were with me and although she had remembered getting a gluten free bread there in the past- they seemed to be clueless about the whole concept. IDK where she had a gluten free sub??   I enjoyed my overall experience. IDK WHY they are adding pizza sauce to sub/hoagies. The only sandwich that should get pizza sauce added is a meatball/ chicken/ eggplant/ Parmesan... not on a standard PHILLY cheese steak.   The owners might want to take a trip to the city of brotherly love and  eat a Philly cheese steak and realize it doesn't come with lettuce and tomato either. Also NJ because - the jersey sub doesnt hit the mark exactly either.   If your still reading this.. just know this is an epic sandwich joint with no frills and Dr. Brown's soda... they arent here for the games or shenanigans... ORDER your delicious warm sub .. eat it there and go home to pass out.",

The hot turkey with provolone is a major exception. Sub One is my favorite hoagie shop in town. The turkey is always really flavorful and the simplicity of everything else about it is really what I enjoy most.   As others have said, there's nothing fast about the service but it's a good opportunity to slow down and appreciate the variety of folks who appreciate the offerings here. The parking to fairly easy once you know what's an actually spot and what's not.   There a service fee for using a card, but the food itself is so budget friendly you won't whine about the fee or you'll find a $10 and have a filling lunch without concern.",

I have been a couple times now and if you get a cup of water with your sandwich you're looking at a lunch likely under $6.00 all in.  The people that run the place are extremely nice and a pleasure to deal with.  The ingredients are fresh and made to order just as you tell them you like it.  Personally, I love the veggie sub.    The decor is circa 1994, so don't come in here looking for posh seating and anything trendy.  This is a get in, get your order and grub on your food type of place.",
