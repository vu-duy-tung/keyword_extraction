    "text": "Do not support this business! I called to make reservations on Saturday 3/30 for 3/31 and was told they didn't take reservations but to download the app to add your party to the wait. Sunday morning I downloaded the app and noticed I was online able to make a reservation for up to 6 people. My party was for 7. I called the restaurant immediately and was told \"no problem just make the reservation for 6 and then when you arrive tell the hostess you have an additional person.\" The app told us the wait was 1 1/2 hours long and to arrive at 11:50am. We arrived around 11:35am to check in and was told that we had to wait another 1-2 hours because the person I spoke with gave incorrect information and that If you have a party over 6 YOU CAN NOT USE THE APP. I complained to the manager and said we were celebrating my Mother's birthday and had done everything I was told to do, can you not still accommodate us since your staff provided incorrect information. The manager was dismissive and showed no emotion and told me \"oh well, sorry\" I was livid! We decided to take our business elsewhere. Disgusting!!!",

I was spoken to very rudely by the hostess when asking for more cups for the coffee.  While waiting for my table for nearly 2 hours I needed to take my son to the restroom at an alternate location.  When my table was finally ready, I explained where I was and would be there shortly.   I was ultimately told my table could not be held because other people had been waiting 2 hours!  Screw this place, there are too many other places to eat in Charlotte!",

We watched multiple parties walk out discourages at the fact that there were multiple  tables open and tons of people waiting.  At one time there were 8 people in another line just to pay their bill.  The group of people in the front seem overwhelmed and they are not friendly nor are they helpful.

This was my second visit and it will likely be the last unfortunately. After a 20 min wait or so I was led to a table. I requested dry toast because on my first visit my toast was slathered in butter. The waitress clearly indicated my preference on the ticket today and of course when my food was finally delivered after a very long wait my toast was covered in butter. However, my waitress was nowhere to be found and didn't come check to see whether my order came out correctly. I had to flag her down when I eventually saw her. I really had no intention of being there an hour. She gladly requested that an order of toast be sent out which I never received, but since she still did not check to see if it arrived, I finished my food and asked another wait person if he could locate my waitress so that I could get my check. He actually returned with my check though he was not my waitperson. Today, was really disappointing experience. The food is good from what I've had but the wait is too long and it seems some of the staff need a bit more training on how to interact with patrons. As I said, it is highly unlikely that I will return in the future.",

    "text": "It seems like Charlotte can't do brunches very well. My family and I tried First Watch on Saturday, September 8, to celebrate my sisters birthday and enjoy a great brunch. However, while I wasn't horrified by the food, I did leave disappointed considering the amount of time we waited.   Maybe I should stop ordering omelettes at brunch restaurants, but I always feel that one joint will finally prepare an amazing omelette. At First Watch, I ordered their Chile Chorizo Omelette, which came with chorizo (chorizo), avocado, green chilies, roasted onions, and Cheddar cheese with a side of seasoned potatoes. I have to say that the omelette was very bland. Even with added salt and pepper, there wasn't enough cheese or the other aforementioned toppings that added any flavor to the omelette. The potatoes were also served a bit burnt and were inconsistent with hardness, with some less cooked than others.  Not all is average though; the million-dollar bacon truly lives up to the title. It's well cooked with a perfect amount of crunch, along with a great blend of sweet and savory. I would've ordered two sides of this bacon as my main meal instead. The interior design and decor of the restaurant is also great. It felt very airy and homely, and of course it was very clean.  Overall, besides the bacon, the rest of the food was bland. I was able to try some of the other dishes my family ordered (we love to share), and those dishes were also about average. I would still recommend this place for those with strict diets, as First Watch (being health-focused) offers many substitutes for regular ingredients at no extra charge, which is rarely the case at any restaurant. For those who just want a great brunch place in Charlotte regardless of healthy alternatives, look elsewhere.   (For example, Le Peep in the Arboretum on Providence Road has the best omelettes of any brunch/diner I've been to in Charlotte)",

I had to wave her down when I wanted to order a tea because the water she served us was warm and had specks in it.

We waited an hour to eat here, we should be allowed to enjoy our breakfast without being rushed out after 30 minutes. Food was okay. Lemon curd pancakes were dry, but my husband loved his biscuits and gravy. Place seemed clean until we sat down to our wet and sticky table that our menus were stuck to. No one cared if we had a good experience, we felt like cattle. It's a shame because the First Watch in Florida is amazing.

If you have time to wait 45-60 minutes for the \"10-15 wait (with 2 parties ahead of me)\" the app promises, then you won't be disappointed. However, unless you are eating solo, your wait at the Waverly location will be 2-3x longer than the app reflects. It doesn't tell you that you won't be seated when there are 0 parties ahead if you. Who would expect that there would be a 20 minute wait at the Waverly location once we were \"up\" according to the app? Why would the management at Waverly have issues with the app (and blame the app) when the Matthews location doesn't? Since we are familiar with First Watch and using the app with other locations, we had an expectation that we would 'get in line' via the app and figure out if the wait time was in line with our stomachs' timing. I have been to this location solo, with my husband, as well as with my family of five and the results are only okay when being seated solo. I have gone to both the Waverly and the Matthews location and the Matthews location is by far better at 'guesstimating' wait times and meeting expectations.",

I've ordered a few different things--pancakes, eggs, toast, and bacon, and all of them were just sort of slapped onto the plate and were subpar compared with what I could have gotten at home. If someone invites me to breakfast and wants to go to First Watch, I will go because I don't totally hate it, but I won't choose to go back on my own. The only redeeming quality is the coffee, which is always exceptional!",

Came in 30 min. Before closing.  The owner stood  near the door encouraging his girls for smiling on this blustery, soaking wet Hurricane Florence weekend.  I chatted with him a moment and they took me to a table.  Everything about this barn turned outside in is HAPPY and bustling about this place.  The music.  Atmosphere and people.     Since I'm a red blooded all American, of course I ordered the  Bacanado, a juicy fluffy omelette with stretchy cheese, Bacon  ,  , sour cream, side of GF toast- no charge and switched from greens mix to potatoes because I'm a fiend.    The meal was solid.   Huge pile of  potoates  Stuffing  omelette.  Jam is good like a Tom Petty concert!  Filled up this overgrown battlefield warrior..   Looks like I know where breakfast is this week!  I'll have to bring my 21 kids here soon once the inheritance comes in lol!",

Our server, sigh...It took him forever to come over and take our drink order and when he did, he didn't get it right nor did he ever get it right.  I just wanted two more glasses for water and the coffee carafe and water bottle filled, that's all.  He did have enough time to spend at the hostess counter talking to the hostess looking at his phone.  Ahem, I digress.    The food was okay.  We all thought it was a bit over cooked.  The pancakes were super dry.  The coffee wasn't as great as it was at the Matthews location either????  The young ladies that brought our food were over-the-top fantastic.  One of the girls came back several times because our server forgot us.  She brought my glasses, the syrup, more coffee and water.  So I went ahead and gave her half of the tip I would have left the waiter.    We got our check from the waiter and he left and went back to the hostess station to chat some more and check his phone again.  We finished up and he never came back.  I had to send someone in my party to go get to go boxes (waste not....)  from the hostess station.    I don't think I'll be back to this location.",

    "text": "GREAT addition to Waverly.   We needed another breakfast and lunch place and this fits the bill.  The wall and ceiling decorations are funky and fun.  The food is fresh and served up quickly.  Today, I had a frittata with egg whites and mushrooms and kale and tomatoes and cheese.  It was very good and was served with some greens on the side of the plate.  Also had a long piece of bread that was served with strawberry jam.  I had to request the strawberry jam and the serving size was a bit meager, but yummy.   My lunch companion, Deanna, had a salad and seemed to enjoy it.  The noise level is a little much here, similar to a lot of restaurants with high ceilings and concrete floors.  Our server was obviously trying to give hints that it was time for us to go, after we had finished our meal.  She brought drinks to go and asked us to take the bill up front to the register.  When we remained seated, she came back to the table and said that she would take our bill up there for us.  It came across as a big hint, even though she was friendly and efficient.   These restaurants will just need to learn that when I show up, it is for food and an extended visit with one of my friends.  It is NOT an eat and run affair!  I will return here.",

Service was the worst I've seen in some time. Took 10 minutes to get drinks. Food was delivered without condiments on the table. Had to grab another server for ketchup and syrup. Server says, \"Ketchup is usually on the table\". Thanks Captain Obvious! It wasn't, that's why I asked!!,  The food was meh, for an overpriced breakfast spot. This was our $37 order; decaf coffee, hash scramble, 2 blueberry pancakes, orange juice, Belgian waffle, bacon and potatoes. Waitress who had no clue, checked on us as we finished and asked, \"How is everything?\"  Really? Where were you 15 minutes ago when we required syrup and ketchup?   The size of the pancakes get 2 stars for the size. I haven't seen pancakes that big since the Copal Grill \"hubcaps\". Experience was really one star.   Don't waste your time or money. IHOP would have been better........",

The management and servers are quick, kind, and go the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied. During the busy wait of the after church crowd, they provided us with free coffee and infused water! They offer healthy but tasty options such as avocado toast and acai bowls! A hit in my book is the Morning Meditation Juice, Million Dollar Bacon, Tri-Athlete, and the A.M. Superfood bowl.",

    "text": "Just to make this clear, I haven't eaten at a First Watch in 8 years. And let me tell you that I am completely disappointed. Their waiting list system is just ridiculous. If said customer was to come to the restaurant without joining the 'No Wait' app, all of the app-using consumers get slots in the waiting list with HIGHER priority. An ideal system would work so that App customer and non-app customers alike both get equal priority as they get on a list. When I arrived at the restaurant, they said that there was nobody ahead of us in line and we would be seated shortly. Sadly, that was not the case. At least five groups got seated before us and they had the same number of people as us. Blimey! Also, the last time I had eaten here, the menu was just simple breakfast basics such as pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Now, it's just a plethora of organic hippie cuisine that they can charge us more for. Now, in all fairness, I understand that menus should change based on changes in audience, so this appeals to many younger people. But, now it's just saturated to the point of no return. One last thing, the waiting area at the Waverly location is about the size of a postage stamp. There are very limited brunch restaurant options these days, especially on weekends when everyone is sick of their weekday raisin bran. When building a restaurant, you have to take things like capacity into consideration. We were all squished in that little corner like sardines in a can. This is very disappointing, keeping in mind that this location is very new and they could have easily avoided this if the builders put more thought into it. We eventually after about thirty minutes left and went to IHOP down the street with no wait at all. In conclusion, First Watch is just bad.",

My sister ordered the million dollar bacon and it was yummy if you like a little sweet with your salty. My personal favorite of the bacon was the regular that my friend and I split-- so crunchy! The bacon originally came out a little soft but when we asked them to cook them longer they were very accommodating and made them exactly like we wanted it! Another friend who was with me ordered the chia seed pudding, so good and a dish I haven't seen anywhere else. Also don't forget about the waffle my friend also ordered, so great and came with fresh  fluffy butter and a delicious fruit compote. Definitely go!",

We mentioned it to the waitress, who said she told her manager, but it never changed while we there. Our whole party just ended up going to the car to get coats and ate lunch in our winter coats. The service was not good. Took about 10 mins for anyone to come to our table to begin with, the first 2 plates came out at least 10 mins before the other 2 in our party, and they couldn't wait for us to get our meals because it was freezing in there, they would've gotten cold! There was a dirty plate sitting on the ledge right next to our table that we had to ask the waitress to take away.  Just a bad experience overall. And this was on a Monday afternoon.

It's really loud (soft materials like curtains or fabric art could absorb sound).  Not a relaxing morning spot, but still worth a trip for the food.  They turn the tables quickly.",

Got my coffee but we had to ask another server for the other drink. For food we got a breakfast sandwich and lemon pancakes to split. It was both delicious but no one checked on us so we had to ask yet again another server to get us the syrup. The other waiter even ended up bringing us our check; not sure how that works. Was not a fan of being able to see the servers hang out and chat while we are trying to get help. Willing to try another location for the food.",

I haven't ordered anything but the avocado toast which is by far the best around. My 2nd grader ordered the crepes once and did NOT like them (they were a bit greasy tasting) so he requires some encouragement to go here and we have been working to order him different things (no more crepes) - he's a million dollar bacon fan, so that's something. Hubs has started to follow me and also orders the avocado toast. Not sure there IS anything else on the menu (ha ha). I love fresh - I don't like that they don't give you ice in the waters, but I'm sure there's a logical reason for it. Coffee pots sit on the table, which is great, but some mornings we need more than ONE pot.",

I'm giving the restaurant a one star rating before I even get my food because of the service.  When asked for a simple straw we were told \"to bad so sad\" by the server.  When I go to an establishment and pay $50 for breakfast I don't want any political commentary on whether or not I use a straw.  If you think straws will be the end of the earth than you should serve paper straws and not plastic straws.  Eventually, we received our straws, but felt like we were the dregs of the day universe for asking.  As an aside, we tried to go to the Matthews location on Sunday.  I downloaded the app and used their \"waiting in line\" option so we could be place on their list.  The app said at that moment there was a twenty minute wait which was great.  Upon arrival, we were told even though we were already on their list it would be an hour wait.  Not good!!  We left and went to a very good breakfast restaurant located in the Arboretum by the Firestone store.  Got in and seated in five minutes and had excellent food.  Just sayin'.",

Even better since they've added the ability to see what wait times are & add yourself to the wait list.  Fabulous feature.   I'm a fan of the avocado toast! Love the amount of avocado like 1 whole avocado on each side of the toast w/a light finish of oil.  The basted eggs are wonderful.  They are like a poached egg & a little firmer than a sunnyside up but still that yummy runny yolk.   Pumpkin pancakes special for the season was a subtle flavor that still mixed well w/maple syrup.   Love the concept of all wholesome type of food :)",

    "text": "Disappointing. This was our first time here, and we had heard good things about the place, so we were really looking forward to our time here. Initial impression were all positive: clean, inviting atmosphere, and a constant flow of people coming in the doors.  We had a friendly server who suggested the seasonal pumpkin pancakes, which I ordered, while my spouse ordered Floridian French toast. After that, everything went down hill.  While waiting for breakfast to come, we had some coffee, but the entire tray of coffee creamer on the table was flavored, so we had to wait for our server to get regular cream, and throw out the coffee I had already poured with the flavored cream. Breakfast came, and the French toast bread was undercooked and tasted \"doughy\". Actually side order of 'million dollar bacon', also very undercooked, was anything but appetizing. The restaurant is real big on farm fresh and healthy choices. The orange juice was fresh squeezed, but it still seemed like it was lacking, as if it was diluted.  Finally, it was time to pay or bill. The pay counter is purely situated so that there is virtually no privacy from people coming in the front door and waiting. Worse, the pay location is right on the main aisle to the kitchen. While waiting second in line, I was bumped into from people at the table nearest the register behind me , and bumped into no less than five times by staff going to and fro the kitchen. I was in the way no matter where I stood. A horrible setup. It was then my turn to pay, and the cashier asked how our experience was. I said, \"not so good.\" He didn't bother to inquire further and didn't seem to care. I then explained that the pay line is poorly designed and I was constantly in the way. I suggested they move the register back as there was plenty of room behind him. Again not much response.  A lot of hype about a new local restaurant. Much ado about nothing. Substandard quality food and pricey. This place isn't a big deal. There are better are more reasonable priced places nearby. No desire to return.",

    "text": "BE PREPARED TO WAIT. AND WAIT. AND WAIT. We've been to this First Watch probably 5 times now. There's always a wait to get a table but that is understandable because the food is good and it's a prime location. We've sat at the community table to avoid this or run errands close by (they say they won't hold your table more than 3 minutes though).   What frustrates me the most is that even if you order right away, you still won't get your food for 30 minutes. Sometimes you'll get seated and be completely forgetten - I've had to wave my hands to someone to get a waitress before. Thankfully that didn't happen on our latest visit because we had already waited over an hour for our table. We ordered as soon as the waitress brought our water and then waited. And waited. And waited. The food FINALLY showed up after about 30 minutes. The place was not no longer at full capacity by the time we were seated but regardless, it boggles my mind that it takes 30 minutes for a restaurant to make breakfast food.   The other thing that disappoints me a little are the side options. The potatoes are only cooked (albeit golden) on one side so the texture isn't my favorite - they feel so dry in your mouth. I often sub them for the greens but lately there have been too many bitter red greens in the mix. I've asked for other options and was told I could get grits. Why not fruit? Another disappointment was the strawberries on our lemon ricotta pancake seemed like they'd been cut and stored several days ago. They were mushy and dull.  My husband said his chickichanga was good but he didn't taste any chorizo or spiciness from it.  The reason I pay this much to receive super-slow moderately-friendly service for breakfast food is because the elevated egg sandwich is so good. Sometimes the egg is super runny, and sometimes it's firm but either way I love it (mushy egg would be perfection!).   The ambiance is good and definitely a draw. It's always very cold inside in the summer (bring a sweater!) On the latest visit our table and chairs were dirty (looked like the last customer spilled makeup all over the seat so I'm glad I looked before sitting).  Our waitress did ask if everything was OK, and it was. It was good. Nothing was bad enough to be worth complaining about, especially when you're an hour and a half in and ready to get on with your day. I just wish they could figure out how to improve efficiency. If they did I'd be tempted to go there a lot more often.",

Checked in only an hour ago and then went to restaurant and waited 1/2 hour+ because they only have one or two tables that can fit parties of more than 4!!  Finally sat down to eat and found bacon under the table. Not to mention it took 45 mins to get our food! Order of pancakes came without syrup and had to ask for it multiple times before we received it. Last order of pancake didn't even come until everyone finished eating because apparently it \"went to the wrong table\". Can they get anything right?

    "text": "This was our second visit to this location - with the first visit being on a VERY busy Saturday - and it was great.    This last visit though dropped the rating down tremendously.  I went with my wife on a Thursday Morning and were seated fairly quickly as the place wasn't busy.  We sat there for over 10 minutes before I got up and asked if someone was going to help us.  We were finally waited on, and I got coffee and my wife got water.  They bring the coffee out in a stainless steel carafe and the water in a little glass bottle that resembles the old milkman jugs.  I poured some water into 2 cups, but stopped my wife from drinking it as there was junk floating around it.  I figured it was the glass - so I got a new cup from the table and same thing.  I looked in the water jug - paper and green things were floating - it was a very high turbidity amount as well.  We did not see any one for a while so I flagged down a different waitress who apologized and went to get us a new jug.  My wife just went to get her water out of the car at this point - which was a good thing since the next jug also has stuff floating in it.  Barf!  Our food came out and this is the disappointing part - the food is good.  I ordered eggs, chicken sausage (really good stuff), grits and this multigrain toast that's wonderful.  My wife ordered a kids pancake and bacon - since the pancake is 10\" and thick.  When my wife went to check out and use a BOGO - they said it wouldn't work for a kids pancake...but it would have worked for a more expensive pancake meal....so that was just the nice ending of a customer service nightmare.    Food - 4 or 5 stars Service - 1 star Water - 0 stars",

It's showing 1/2 hr but here it's a ONE-AND-A-HALF-HOUR wait n ppl r corralled in the small front area breathing in deep sighs. We were lucky to race in when we did n got to the reception thru the mass. Ppl came in groups wanting booths or singular tables while we didn't care if we sat on the communal, long, high table so we didn't hv to wait at all really but space was tight.  Waitress came, gave us coffee n took our order. Just a lil disappointed she forgot to bring more regular cream so we asked the ppl next to us. She never brought any while we hv this huge container to drink? Don't feel like bothering our neighbors again. They might want to use their stash, too.   Ordered the Harvest specials of Pumpkin Pancake Breakfast n Heritage Pork Chop n Eggs. Will post more after ...  Loved the melted, crusted cheesey topping of the HPCE grits n loved the sausage patty that came with the PPB. But, for a $30.05 breakfast for two, I thought it too pricey for the servings were stark; the pork chop very salty n not \"tasty\"; the ONE pumpkin pancake void of specialty zing/tang; badly washed utensils; and, table condiments needing a wipe down.   Having had an international hotel career, in the F&B and Marketing sector, what we are charged for should reflect the level we deserve, don't you agree?  They underestimated the restaurant space as well since it could not accompany all those customers corralled at the front reception for 1 1/2 hours. It really shouldn't be like that. Deceivingly, there were so many open parking spaces which makes one think zip in, zip out. Nope.   Hmm, I don't know if I'd eat here on weekends.  I'd like to be open minded, trying weekdays when it's less crowded since I hvn't tried other dishes.",

Their summer menu acai bowl is incredible, and their egg white omelette (pictured) is to die for. I also recommend getting their homemade toast with almond butter and strawberry jam. You won't regret it!!   If you're a coffee fan, their vanilla iced coffee is delicious! If you like your coffee on the stronger side, ask for less cream!",

    "text": "Today's visit was our first time trying this place out for breakfast as our usual spot was closed. I checked in on Yelp as I saw the wait time varied between 35-60 minutes. Upon arrival, our party of 5 adults plus 1 child continued to wait about 40 minutes after checking in.   After waiting some time, a few of us went inside to grab coffee but the carafe was out. I ended up checking on our wait time since it had already been about 30 minutes from when we had checked in with the hostess on our arrival. The hostess responded that she didn't know how much longer and then said it would be another 30 minutes.   When we were seated, there was one coffee mug and water glass for the table of 5 adults and one child. We mentioned to the waiter we were ready for coffee, water, and for him to take our order when he arrived since the wait was longer than anticipated.   The place was packed and the service undoubtedly suffered. It took awhile to get coffee for everyone and even longer to get waters and creamer. When the food was brought out, it seemed only mine had an issue - it was the trifecta but such a small portion of eggs. We had ordered one scrambled egg as a side and that was even larger than the \"two egg portion\" that came with my plate.  I mentioned it to the waitress who brought out the food and she happily brought some more eggs (thank you for noticing).    All in all, it's a spot to go to but it probably won't be my first or second choice for a weekend breakfast. May be better during the week! No pictures of food since we were so hungry.",

They do the yelp waitlist which is nice, so even during busy times you can go ahead and get your spot in line before arriving. Parking was plentiful here  when I visited.  We didn't really have much of a wait since we used the waitlist and were seated fairly quickly. We tried the seasonal juice which was amazing and I'd recommend. We also got the lemon ricotta pancakes, million dollar bacon, and the seasonal cornbread carnitas. The lemon ricotta pancakes were light and fluffy and well balanced with the lemon. The bacon was also very good. The carnitas lacked flavor so I wouldn't recommend this dish, but the others were great. Nice addition to the area.",

    "text": "So I finally made it to First Watch for breakfast.  We must have gotten there during a slow spell because we were seated right away.   But by the time we left, there was clearly a bit of wait for a table.  Even with open tables, though, this place is LOUD.  And as the tables filled, it got louder.  So don't go here and expect to carry on a conversation without considerable difficulty.  (Note to owners:  Please consider adding some sound insulation.)  At first glance, the food was a bit more pricey than I usually want to spend for breakfast.  But once my crab omelet arrived at my table, I understood the prices:  it was stuffed with tons of crab meat.  The food was fresh and well prepared.  I'll be honest, the service could have been a little better.  There were stretches where I really needed some more napkins but our waitress was nowhere to be found.  Overall though, I was impressed.  The only thing that would really stop me from going back is the noise.",

There just always seems to be something uniquely delicious on their seasonal menu which runs for a limited amount of time per season. This time two such options were the Lemon Blueberry Quinoa Pancakes and Smoked Salmon Tzatziki Toast.  The pancakes were loaded with fresh blueberries and accompanied by a berry compote and topped with granola and berry butter. They were perfectly fried a golden pbrown and absolutely delicious. I hope to order at least once more while they are still available on the spring menu.  The salmon toast was also excellent and beautifully plated along with two superbly prepared over easy eggs. Coffee was delicious and service was friendly and attentive. Nice extras that have become necessities, like raw sugar and fresh creme, are also readily provided. As always though, this place can be noisy.",

I ordered their new summer menu item of the crab omelette. When the food came out to our table they brought the wrong item out for me. I understand restaurants make mistakes and this wasn't a big issue for me. It did take a little longer the wait for the corrected meal but the manager came over and apologized and said my meal was free. Once my food did some out it was delicious. It was my co workers first time there and they enjoyed it as well. I wish they were open later but I love it there!",

The combo menu(any two choices of salad, soup or sandwich) is always a good deal! Sweet honey pecan salad is my favorite. Ham and gruyere melt sandwich is good too. Also I enjoyed their morning meditation fresh juice. Balanced well with beet and orange juice, can't taste strong ginger or turmeric. Want to try kale tonic juice next time!",

She came back  and seemed awkward and in a hurry. She took our food orders and we still didn't have water. We ordered and the food took a long while. My husband who had to get back to work was getting grumpy (it had been about 45 minutes by then) and of course as soon as the food came out our waitress dropped his plate on the ground (oops!). She was very sorry and said his food would be comped but his replacement food took a longggg time. I had finished my plate by then and it was very awkward.

This was a \"healthy\" option in my mind because it was chicken sausage which I appreciated.  Honestly, the biscuit was fluffy and perfectly prepared.  It was not soggy when it arrived.  The gravy and scrambled eggs were also great.    Let's just say my wife and I arm wrestled for the last strip of bacon...  of course she won.  It was that good!

    "text": "First visit to First Watch and it was quite pleasant. We waited for less than 10 minutes before being seated. Our waitress was very sweet and helpful in assisting me in making a decision on what to order. I got the Monterey Club and I believe chicken tortilla or bean soup. Gosh darn it, I can't remember now but it was hot, well seasoned and hearty. Loved it! The club sandwich was just okay. Everything about was good except the turkey which unfortunately was the main component of the sandwich. It was just oddly mushy and no matter how delicious and crispy the bacon, it should couldn't compensate for the weird texture of the turkey.  I also one of their juices that was very delicious and an excellent price at $3.99. It was the morning meditation with orange, lemon, turmeric, organic ginger, agave nectar and beet. If you order anything to drink, get that. Highly refreshing with a nice clean taste. My friend enjoyed her farmhouse breakfast skillet, very hearty and filling. At least it appeared that way. You pay at the counter on your way out and the ladies there were very sweet as well. Thumbs up to the staff we encountered and thumbs up to all the food and drink minus the turkey meat.  Will definitely come back for the soup and the juice and maybe a different sandwich. Give this   That is all!",

I ordered the cold press juice that was super refreshing - I don't recall the name but it had beet and turmeric. We were starving and ordered some toast while we waited for the mains to be prepared. The toast was amazing - big thick cut multigrain slices pre buttered with a side of strawberry jam. Delicious. I got the egg sandwhich that came topped with smashed avocado, bacon and gruyere  served on a brioche bun. It was insanely good. Of course there was no way I could leave this establishment without trying the lemon ricotta pancakes so my husband and I got them to share - also an absolute must- fluffy pancakes riddled with ricotta topped with lemon cream (a little over powering) and strawberries. We will be returning soon.",

The server was nice, but it didn't compensate for the fact that we waited 40 minutes for a table, while we watched 5 tables stand open, because the kitchen was so backed up. And I can account for that because we ordered as soon as we sat down and then waiting as we watched with a birds-eye view of the kitchen for 40 more minutes while nothing left. The server brought us toast to hold us over, while my son ate a left over half of an apple. The open  Tip: If you do choose to try this place, check in online and at least cut half of your expected hour wait.",

    "text": "I generally do not enjoy a cooked breakfast. It's usually too heavy and sticks with me all day. I had heard so many good things about First Watch that I decided to give them a try despite my reservations. What a delightful surprise! This is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had and I will definitely be returning with all of my friends. This was our 2nd attempt to eat here, as our 1st attempt was on a weekend, but we were not willing to wait an hour! We returned on a Tuesday morning and were seated almost immediately. Our waiter was very helpful with the menu, and made sure we had our beverages while we perused the menu.  I started out with one of their fresh juices, and I can't remember the name of it but it had beat in it and was fantastic! For the main course I have the salmon and shallot frittata and it was a perfect melange of flavors without any being overpowering.   Another thing I really like is that they serve the eggs with a nice light salad instead of heavy potatoes and it really helps in keeping you from feeling overfull all morning. Having said that, if you want their potatoes you can substitute. We also ordered a side of their million dollar bacon and it was worth every penny. The combination of spice and sweet is sheer perfection.    I like the fact that our server watched our progression and brought the ticket at just the right time period we were able to check out when we were ready without having to wait to get a ticket. Over all, I highly recommend First Watch!",

Walked inside, stood at the register while 2 employees fussed back and forth about an order mix up before they walked off without acknowledging me.  Literally stood at the front for another 5-7 minutes before another employee walked up and asked if I was ready to 'cash out'.  I can only imagine the look on my face.  The ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE!!!!

Received our order fairly quickly however my \"poached eggs\" came out hard boiled and the avocado on my sandwich was the size of a lemon rind in your tea. The salad was a few 4 bites of mixed greens tossed in a very, very small amount of lemon and olive oil. They took back the order and 20 min later, after my friends were finished with their breakfast brought me now undercooked eggs (the whites were dripping and  bright yolk visible- not at all poached). When I hesitated to accept the new plate, my friends reinforced what I was seeing and said, \"you can't eat that/ they are definitely not cooked.\" The waiter proceeded to say, \"you didn't want them hard boiled- right?\" I said...no- I didn't want them hard boiled. But I can not eat raw eggs either.\" At that point, I asked to just take them back- I didn't want to delay my friends any longer. He proceeded to bring me a check with my $3.13 coffee charge- tacky after I sat and watched my friends eat- to absorb the cost of the coffee would have been expected. Portions also significantly smaller than when they first opened. We will be finding a new brunch spot. Will not return.",

It was not a comfortable wait.  Once we were seated, we found the table to be dirty with dripping beads of moisture on all of the glassware.  When I brought this to management's attention, I was discounted.  We decided to leave and go to eat elsewhere.  I can guarantee we will never set foot in this loud, obnoxious restaurant again.  I have been to First Watch on many occasions in Cincinnati with much quieter and roomy spaces--not to mention more professional staff.  Shame on you for tarnishing the First Watch reputation.",

The hostess Branden(SP?) informed me .. not to get hasty.. I could either deal with the wait or leave.. wow..  have spoken to the owner , reaching out to corporate.. they have a reputation for decent food and horrible service.. see they are living up to their reputation .",

Everything is always super fresh and having healthy options that are also delicious makes eating better a breeze.   The service is great.   The dining area always clean and inviting.  You just can't go wrong with taking your family and friends out for a great meal.",

After 40 min we were then told there are 8 call aheads in front of us.  Ridiculous!!  I'd rather give my business somewhere else",

We got there at 8am, and then it took 15 minutes for anyone to come by after we were seated. Then, after we finally got our order placed, it took 20 minutes for it to come. After we got the food, we didn't see our waitress again for a long while. It was only getting busy when we were leaving, so I'm not sure why it took so long.",
