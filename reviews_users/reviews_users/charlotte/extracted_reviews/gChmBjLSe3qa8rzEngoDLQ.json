    "text": "Came here with some colleagues during a business trip for dinner and cocktails. We asked our hotel where they would recommend, and this was the place. Apparently it's very popular with professional athletes. I wouldn't know if we saw any as I'm not a big sports fan, but this was clearly a place where people go to be seen.  This place is hoppin', so make sure to make a reservation if you're eating and don't want to have to wait forever for a table. (We did and still had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated.) Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. The nachos are as insanely good as they are insanely bad for you, but a worthy food sin. The stuffed dates that were also recommended were fine, but didn't knock my socks off.  The table service bread was VERY good.  I got the kale and squash salad for my entree and it was fantastic. The citrus dressing really made it come alive and I didn't regret not getting the burger that I had *really* wanted. (One of my colleagues did get it and said it was excellent. I stole a french fry and they were also great.)  The cocktails were okay. Very expensive, but on price for a place like this and the quality of liquor they used. You're paying for the ambiance as well as the ingredients.   There is a patio with a panoramic view of downtown Charlotte that you can't miss if you come here. It's worth staying for a drink to admire.",

After two hours of being at my table I have seen my waiter only two times , and I like to drink not a good thing. Umm my check has been on my table with the credit card ready for about 30 mins. The waiter can make or break the experience. All and all the timing and service made this a poor experience. I wish them luck.",

We had the nachos, mushroom pizza and Spring rolls ( you only get 2) and everything was delicious. I really enjoyed it but I was also in really great company. They have half price apps until 6:30 (on select items). But if you've never had the chance to visit, make sure you do. The views are breathtaking!!!! (Warning: there is a fire burning outside and they won't turn it off, so if you sit near it, it may get a little hot)",

    "text": "Went here this past weekend before going to a show, and thought it would be good to experience the view, and food. I fault myself for not doing better research on the place, because it is the embodiment of an overpriced hotel restaurant. Tacky presentation, mediocre food, poor drinks, and attentive yet mediocre service. The menu looked shabby, and the paper (on terrible card stock) trying to sell me on a NYE event was just the start. The server, was very attentive in that awkward sort've way, but did a good job in getting our orders, etc.   We ordered the Chicken Spring Rolls and Mussels first, and both were sort've blah. The red sauce the mussels came in was bizarre, and a poor attempt at being different from your standard white whine sauce. The Spring Rolls came out on a bizarre triangular piece of paper, which seemed incredibly desperate in an attempt to be creative. For our entrees we had the Ribeye and Sea Bass. The Ribeye came out overcooked (Med/Well+), and I had to send it back since you would expect a $45 steak come out the way you ordered (Med/Rare). They did give a bowl of soup to make up for the steak, which was probably the best thing we ate all night.   The drinks were light on the liquor, and far to sweet or watered down for our liking.   Overall we don't plan on going back here, and this place has alot of room for improvement.",

    "text": "Down here from NYC for a family gathering, a family member who lives here picked this spot.  Against my better judgment, we obliged and went here.  So many small things added up to a disappointing experience.  As a party of 7, we were seated in a back section of the restaurant, under the air conditioning vent, by the service station and near the service doors.  A/C was freezing, and we requested to be moved to another large setup, as the room was basically empty.  We were told they couldnt turn the air down, nor move our party.  Ok, fair enough, although i dont particularly care to have staff hauling garbage and recycling by me all evening.  We attempted to order four different bottles of wine, all four of which were not available.  Odd, but ok, fair enough.  Perhaps you should update your wine list.  The real problem i had came down to food and service.  The food was average.  The calamari was greasy, my snapper was very tough.  My wife's scallops were cooked properly but presentation was unimaginitive.  The short rib was decent but unremarkable for the cost.  The best part of my dinner was the coconut base for the fish.  Thank god for small miracles, i suppose.  The service was at times aloof, unprofessional and lazy.  Bottles of wine took ages to arrive.  At one point our server rested his forearm across the back of my chair for several minutes, while i was seated, while answering questions about the menu.  Manhandled water glasses while refilling, clearing plates before people were finished eating; all basic things one should not do.  Not sure who trains waitstaff here, but a refresher course is in order.",

Because of you and your poor customer service, and your inability to accommodate a reservation made more than 7 days ago, for party of 7, we were able to enjoy an amazing dinner at Aria. The best Italian food and all of Uptown Charlotte.. And amazingly accommodating and incredibly special. To the owner, when your service manager tells a party of 7 from a billion-dollar corporation that they cannot have a seat with a  window view area because the owner made reservations for his two parties, then clearly something is missing with the concept of the customer.",

For my entree I had the glazed salmon over mashed potatoes and why wife had the lobster mac and cheese. All of this sounds positive right? So why the 2-star? Our server tagged my bill for a large party gratuity of 20% and never informed us. There were 2 of us in the party. WTF? I can't believe they have the ability to use this at their leisure. Most restaurants allow this for party's of 6 or more. For the record I left him another $20 to make a point, don't judge a book by its cover. I'll never eat here again because of the service.",

The salads were simple- just greens & 3 teeny tiny quarter pieces of sugared walnuts. Wow. Hubbys salad had croquette goat cheese on the side & that was really good.  The desserts were a small little round cake that sucked. The other dessert was a cup of chocolate pudding type mousse with a chunk of hard popcorn inside. Everyone had pulled their popcorn out of the dessert b/c it tasted that bad.  The chocolate was good & creamy but that popcorn was awful.",

    "text": "We decided to go to Fahrenheit during restaurant week and perhaps that impacted our experience. We arrived promptly and decided to grab a drink at the bar while our friends arrived - lively bar scene and good cocktail menu. The atmosphere is very \"high end hotel restaurant\" somewhat bland, lots of glass to take advantage of the view and a ton of fireplaces. Not bad but also not really unique.   Once we were seated we were shown the menu - our waiter was solid but obviously was looking to upsell the regular menu. Two members of our group have allergies so they ordered off the regular menu and the kitchen was VERY flexible and helpful in identifying ingredients and tailoring their meals. For the rest of us it was straight-forward.  My biggest issue is with the food itself - while the menu highlights the complexity of ingredients (ie local beets and pickled ginger) the actual product does not reflect that complexity in taste. The calamari was average at best, the hanger steak nothing exceptional (and the portion size was VERY small). Deserts were good but again lack imagination.   Perhaps this is because they are trying to contain costs during Restaurant Week. However, if the intention is to bring diners to the restaurant so that they come back, why scale back the tastes and portion sizes? Finally, we were annoyed that they tacked on a 22% tip for our party of six - while our server did point it out to us, it seems odd to do this for a small group.   Overall there are much better options in Charlotte - we went to Carpe Diem last week during restaurant week and had a stellar experience, much better than this. Other than the view, this is not a place to go out of your way for.",

Went on line to make reservations the night before our visit. Their website is garbage...there is an option to make reservations on line, however when you select the on line reservation function you are directed to the Cleveland location. It was very frustrating and I couldn't get anyone on the phone for Charlotte. So I made the reservation hoping it was just a computer glitch. Next day (day of our reservation) I called the Charlotte venue explained the situation to whoever answered. She was the worst...\"we are all booked and there is nothing I can do.\" That is all she would say. Eventually I got a manager on the phone. She attempted to be helpful...could not accommodate the original reservation time but did get a table for us around 9. She however seemed to not be concerned at all about the computer issue that I explained other than to say we've been booked for a day. The restaurant is very nice. I could tell that they set up tables to accommodate overflow and that made the place seem tiny and extremely crowded. I felt like too close to the party behind me. The atmosphere is overall nice. The food is very good...we did have a ridiculous wait time for our entrees. The appetizer was served promptly. Our waiter was nice...but she wasn't very attentive. She had way too many tables that were spread too far apart. Drinks average...a little watered down. Lamb chop sliders EXCELLENT. Rib eye steak AMAZING. The Pad Thai just ok def not enough shrimp. Would I return, yes I just hope the next experience is better.",

My Fiance and I were going out to celebrate and decided to go somewhere new, we like to frequent several other high end restaurants in Charlotte and do not mind paying for good food and good service so we saw the menu and were excited to try everything.   We arrived and everything started out smooth  beautiful view, great table, we started with a couple drinks that were very good some of the best signature drinks I have had around, then we talked to the server and asked his recommendations for appetizers. He recommended the chorizo stuffed figs which were awesome and we decided to get the Charlotte Nachos which were ok,  a very good size potion but not a ton of flavor or seasoning but overall good.  Then we got to the Entrees, we took the servers recommendations and got the Kobe short ribs and the King Crab Ramen, both letdowns.  The Kobe short ribs was supposed to be their signature dish and the ribs  themselves were very good, flavorful and tender but the broth and noodles with them were just ok and not very memorable. The major issue we had was with the King Crab Ramen, this dish is $42 which doesn't sound that bad for king crab and pork belly, but when it arrives and all the king crab that there is in the dish is maybe a  3 oz piece that is overcooked and falling apart we thought for that price we would get at least one crab leg worth of meat, the pork belly was cooked well at least but then the ramen were mushy and overcooked, maybe we got it on a bad night being a Sunday and all but way overpriced for mediocre food.   We were planning on saying something about it to the server or manager but after we got our food no one came by to check on us until later in the meal when my fiance put the bowl off to the side and a different server asked if we wanted it boxed up. Even at the end when our server did come by he never asked how we liked everything or if it was good.  The service overall was ok, he was knowledgeable and knew what he was doing but didn't really act like he cared.    We did see the manager walking around but he never came by any of the tables near us until we were leaving. I know this restaurant is new but for a place this classy and expensive they should have a higher level of service and food should be higher quality.",

I highly recommend dinner at the bar, best view, best service!",

They are to die for!  I got the lobster Mac and cheese which was more like lobster bisque over noodles but still amazing and my boyfriend got the mustard and coffee crusted pork tenderloin which was also wonderful.  Also the Szechuan green beans for a side are very good!  We didn't have one bad thing to say about the restaurant but after spending almost 150 dollars on two people the valet should have been complimentary, but we still payed 10 and tipped 5.  So maybe they could change that.",

Went on a Thursday night and the bar wasn't that crowded.  Took forever for someone to make eye contact with me ... let alone receive service.  Bartenders were not friendly or hospitable.  This bar could easily receive 5 stars with better service.  The drinks were good ... the food looked amazing ... and the views are phenomenal.  Service needs to improve for me to come back and to suggest this place to others.",

    "text": "Went for a friends 50th bday dinner.  It was packed and very dark.  Felt like I needed a flashlight to see.  Very tight between tables. We did have a large party and were seated in a room that really for small personal parties.  There were 5 other tables of medium to large parties with same server for ALL those tables.  Food that was not ours kept coming to the table and then they would pick it up and take it to the correct table (gross) the back up servers seemed very confused.  Our server seemed less than thrilled to be working.  Most got an appetizer due to $$$.  Everyone liked what they got.  One person got a salad and was served 15 minutes after everyone else with no explanation. Bills came and because we had to valet park (which I do not mind and I feel the $10 is worth it) it was added to my bill. That's all good so you don't have to worry about who to pay to get your car. However, because we were a party over 6 the tip was added to the ticket.  All good I'm ok with that HOWEVER what I'm not ok with is my tip being calculated on the parking!!  One last note... with what I could see of the decor it was sad. Tables looked like they had been purchased from Walmart with the plastic table mats and very uncomfortable chairs.  In short I've experienced but won't be back.",

My son's rib eye was well flavored;  however, it was a little overcooked.  Another of my boys had the mac and cheese and he said it was quite good.  My wife had the scallops and they could have been cooked a tad longer.  The salads were excellent.  My wife and I are both fans of local brewed beers and they have a nice selection there.  The service was excellent and the views are  the best in town.  Given that we were at the soft opening, I fully expected a few of the dishes to be off a little and I have no doubt that Rocco will have everything running smoothly shortly.  This will be the premier restaurant in Charlotte.  With the great food and the views, it will be tough to top.",

The regular dining room is really nice- on a recent Sunday evening the only place to dine was in the open area near the kitchen. It was noisy and had terrible loud music, appealing to an entirely different crowd. If they added acoustical panels on the wall the terrible music might not be so bad, then people won't yell over each other while eating and drinking... The food is excellent, but the identity of the restaurant seems confused.",

First, our cocktail was missing the proseco (the champagne glass was 1/2 full - could have been a hint!  Then our appetizers came late, and some didn't come at all until we asked our server about them.  Then an hour after that our dinner still hadn't come.  The pizza was delivered to a different table next to ours', fingered by the staff, and finally found its way to our way to our table (unappetizing).  The dinners, when they finally came were cold.  Needless to say, we complained to management and our dinner was comped.  A $450 dinner should have been much better than this (both in taste and presentation). The restaurant lost 3 different families and all of their friends.  A total disconnect between the kitchen and patrons!!",

I order the pork chop which was so hard I had to use full muscles to cut it when it should have been medium so they said they would redo it. The next one came out raw!!! So then they said do you want to try something else. They brought me salmon boxed up since everything took forever!!  I get home and opened the box and the fish is raw as well!!! I tried to have an open mind but it took us 15 minutes to get an initial waiter from the start. So pretty much $35 got me a small basic cheese cake and some roasted cauliflower .

    "text": "Aaron did an amazing job serving our party of 6 during the busy Queen's Feast Week, a dining out celebration where select restaurants in the Charlotte area offer an abbreviated menu for a reasonable price ($35). This gives patrons the opportunity to try several dishes on the restaurant's menu, spend less than normal on the usual 3 course meal and creates business buzz for participating restaurants.  Fahrenheit was a no-brainier once I went to check the venue and saw its amazing rooftop view of Uptown Charlotte. It's located on the 21st floor and gives an amazing skyline picturesque scenery of the city. There is also a gorgeous fire pit for those taking a glimpse in the cooler evening hours.   On to dinner: the salmon was delicious, prepared medium just as I requested. The chocolate mouse dessert was decent and the avocado appetizer was tasty enough to get the palette going but nothing to write home about; personally I felt the bread was a bit overbearing and would've been better served on a thin crostini instead.   I particularly enjoyed the ambiance of Fahrenheit more than anything else. Linen napkins, dim lighting, tea light centerpieces, an intimate full bar area with plush lounge seating and secluded booths for couples. My experience was memorable and I'd certainly recommend Fahrenheit for date night, girls night out, happy hour or just celebrating a special occasion.  ~Christy",

I must say the restaurant and the views are beautiful, the staff was wonderful. The manager personally came around and made sure we were happy and even gave me a special birthday dessert, and the food was good. I can't wait to go back, if you go outside on the patio area you have amazing views of uptown and inside you have amazing views of the sky and area buildings. The restaurant is beautiful inside and valet parking is a bargain at $10.",

She also gave our table some avocado appetizers and made sure that we got vegetarian menus!   Louis, who took our drink orders and stopped by sporadically, was very nice and charismatic. He was able to give us recommendations on where to go out later and he was just generally nice to talk to. Our waitress was also nice, but not as personable.   We had two appetizers- an avocado bread spread, and nachos (potato chips drizzled in cheese with scallions). They also brought us pretzel bread with garlic butter. Everything was so good, I was almost full by the time we got our actual food.   I got the arugula pizza and the Charlotte's Wedge salad, and split both with a friend. The salad was tiny, but the pizza was huge! Between the two of us, we finished the salad and took half the pizza home with us. It was all really good!   The view was also great, and a ton of people were on the patio taking photos. I will definitely be back here!",

    "text": "I was nervous considering some of the other recent reviews but I have wanted to visit the rooftop since we moved to the area 2 years ago so I was willing to risk it.  My husband and I had reservations for 6:30 and arrived around 6:15. We checked in at the front and headed outside to see the view. The bar area is really lively (loud) with lots of after-work friends chatting and sports on TV.   The rooftop is fantastic at sunset. There are two, large gas fireplaces to stand near in cold weather. A nice stranger took our photo with the city in the background and we headed back inside to sit at the bar and wait on our table. At 6:30 my husband went back up to the hostess stand and we were seated immediately.  Our table in the dining area had a great view and was in a much quieter part of the restaurant. Our server was excellent. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and told us how much he loved working there. He said they give their employees holidays off and treat them well.  The Food: We ordered the Crispy Tempura Rock Shrimp (sweet/savory) and Roasted Cauliflower Steak (flavorful and spicy) apps. Both were good and large portions. However my husband's dish was too cold and mine was just right temperature-wise. (Honestly we could have just had these and two salads and been full!)  I got the Pan Seared Salmon. The fish was good but had started to cool off a bit, the brussel sprouts were hot and the puree was cold. Maybe it was supposed to be but I prefer my entire meal to be warm ;-)   My husband said his short ribs were just too salty. He was so full from the appetizer that he took most of it home.  Even though we were full we split the Candy Bar dessert. It was good but it was crazy-sweet! Great for you if you really like chocolate.  A good experience with the exception of the temp of our entrees. I guess they need to work on getting the food out at the right temperature. I may try it again when the weather warms up and we can eat outside.",

We had to wait for a table (even with reservations), couldn't transfer bar drinks to our table(which was odd since we'd done it before), but okay. When we were FINALLY seated for dinner, and we sat for 20 minutes and not one server showed up. After my husband got aggravated he flagged down one of the servers to inquire about our server and sadly she came back to take our order , which we were appreciative of but still a bit bothered since our \"real\" server didn't show up until our dinner came out... wow! The food which use to be pretty good was horrible. My husband knew how much I loved the restaurant in the past and made surprise reservations only to be disappointed and annoyed all at the same time. I didn't eat my dinner- it was that bad. They offered something else but at that point I just wanted to leave. We will not be back.",

We show up and the \"event manager\" says no, that she doesn't know anyone by the name of Brooke and in short that we cannot shoot there, and that if we want to schedule it's $300 and between 10am-3pm.  She was very rude about it and turned us away, even though we called for an appointment ahead of time, and were there, in our finery, with a photographer on the clock.

The view is Instagram worthy, the food will soften the heart of the hardest food critic, and the service was good for that night.  It is a little pricy but when the food is as good as it is here, the price may not deter you from going. The drinks are very pricy and they have no excuse for that expect for maybe they have one of the best views in town.  I had made reservations, so one thing that did bother me was that we were asked to wait for our entire party to arrive before we were seated, which I find a little inappropriate for such a high end place where there was plenty of room to seat us. BUT, maybe that's just policy. They would have made more money seating us though, but what do I know.  I am raving about the food but the plate that I had was actually not that spectacular. I had the Maine Lobster Mac and Cheese. It wasn't the best I've had. I've actually had better out of a food truck for $20 less, but maybe my taste buds haven't acclimated to expensive tasting lobster mac and cheese. Maybe. However my two of my comrades ordered the Slow Braised American Wagyu Short Ribs. That is a plate I can stand behind. I would go back to eat here just for this plate alone. So there you have it.",

We asked if we could be moved closer to the window and they said \"no. It's reserved for a VIP\". I have no problem that it's reserved but am I supposed to be impressed that it is for a VIP? Strike two was that there was a whole in our table. Yes a whole. Strike three was the fact that it was our anniversary. They did nothing except say happy anniversary. Thanks  On the way out we had a conversation with one of the managers. She said that for anniversaries they provide a nice dessert. I guess we missed that.

We planned to just get a small bite, but every appetizer sounded so good that we ordered most of the menu.   The Kobe Beef Short Rib Steam Buns was my personal favorite and the Duck Confit Fried Rice was fantastic. Everyone also enjoyed the Lamb Sliders. No one in my party liked the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, unfortunately.  The desserts were, in one word, terrible. We ordered our desserts to go and went downstairs to our room to eat them. We had the vanilla ice cream, which tasted neither like vanilla or ice cream. Everyone in my party agreed that it tasted like a lime/lemon Italian ice. Definitely not what we expected. The Hot Chocolate Entermet was OK, but the chocolate mousse was very dense and the rum cake layer was quite dry. Would recommend skipping dessert here.  Our server was super nice and friendly, but he forgot a few things and seemed to stumble over the menu. Service from the rest of the staff was very good though.   Fahrenheit was better than your average hotel restaurant, but I wouldn't seek it out and I'd say most items are overpriced for what they are.",

Once seated the service started off great but as the night continued the waitress gave us less attention and began paying more attention to an older and larger reservation. The kitchen did a great job on the appetizers (nachos and lobster bisque), as well as 3 of the 4 entrees.... however they miscooked the Kobe burger for my boyfriend and he was forced to reorder... so he chose the pork tenderloin... which proceeded to arrive at the table completely overlooked and grey inside. Thankfully he loved my seared rare salmon and switched his order to that instead.  During the ordering fiasco.. I also was forced to wait for close to 30 minutes for a glass of wine because the waitress forgot to put in the order. The restaurant handled both situations poorly in that I was still charged for the glass of wine and they comped our table the soup of the night (which no one had ordered). They should have comped my boyfriends meal after 2 kitchen mistakes.  The waitress brought out a dessert for my boyfriend which thankfully tasted pretty good, however, another table was also celebrating a birthday... and most of the wait staff sang to that person. No one came over to sing to my boyfriend.  The view was fantastic and the food tasted great however the customer service left a sour taste in my mouth. Would be hesitant to return.",

I ordered short ribs and they were the worst short ribs I have ever had. They were tough and chewy and so salty.  They were also fatty and I had trouble cutting them.  Which I was surprised I was going to have cut anyway since short ribs should be able to shred apart. They were served over noodles which were also way too salty.  I took two bites and could not eat the rest of my dinner.  The service was also way too slow. We were there for a group dinner--it took about an hour and a half to get our food.  Way too slow.  If you are going, go for the view and drinks, but skip the food.",

Even though we sat right down in the bar area \"first come first serve\". The service wasn't anything I would rave about for being such a \"fancy\" restaurant. The ambiance doesn't match the food or service.  I got the duck confit fried rice and it was ok. I expected a little better all around.  The view is what you truly pay for all in all.",

    "text": "I seriously had high hope for this place. I was sadly ultra disappointed. I had planned  a great night out for my girlfriends bachelorette party and was looking forward to having great drinks, yummy food, and spectacular service.   The first problem was we sat at our table for 20 mins before we even had a waiter take our drink order. Next it took him another 20 mins to get our drinks and then he forgot mine, so by this point I think I waited 45 mins to even get a drink  Next was dinner. I ordered the pizza and it was fine, nothing to really brag about but was over priced. 2 of the girls just didn't care for their food at all and just couldn't eat it. The server was friendly and got them something else. The server even communicated that they could keep their meals because they were just going to throw the food away anyways.   The bill comes and the server charged the girls for both meals! The service manager was brought over and was the RUDEST person I have ever encountered. He stated they should have to pay for both meals because they kept both. When my friend said the only reason we kept both was because the sever TOLD US TO! At that point things were heated and my friend being mature and didnt want drama at the table, asked the manager to step aside to talk. He then proceeded to yell at her and was so rude that she was brought to tears! He finally took one of the meals off but told us we could NEVER do that again. Like we would come back there anyways.  The ONLY saving grace of this place was the manager LynnAllen. She was very understanding, apologetic, and friendly. She made us feel so much better and we appreciated her very much, she definitely didn't have to come over but went above and beyond to ensure the night at this establishment ended on a better note.",

Good news is the food was significantly better, however, the bad news is the service was again way off. From waiting 15 minutes to be visited by a server, to being offered a dish meant for another table 3 separate times. There was an advertised Bloody Mary cart that looked great, however, no one to operate it left several tables scratching their heads. Great views, though 5 star pricing for a 2 star experience doesn't add up.",

The service took a while because we were outside but it didn't take too long for our food to get there. I had the grilled avocado with goat cheese crostinis and it was delicious! Two of my friends got the Charlotte nachos and enjoyed them as well. The food and the atmosphere at the restaurant was great and it became more lively as the night went on. I give the restaurant 4 stars because while the food was good, it seemed pretty overpriced. Overall though I would recommend Fahrenheit!",

While I enjoy an upscale restaurant there is nothing upscale about this place other than that it is up in the sky. The scene is unbelievably bad. I saw people on intimate dates having dinner while some tourist like folks in flip-flops and tank tops are jumping up and down in front of them on the balcony.  The quality of the food is below average and that's a compliment.  The bar turned into something you would normally experience at some terrible airport hotel in the middle of nowhere.   My advice: make this more exclusive. If that means less people who support the lease then raise prices. People will pay more but in return this place needs to be truly classy and intimate. And please get some staff that actually knows how to serve anything.  Good luck!",

    "text": "5 stars for ambiance, 4 stars for food and drink, 3 stars for service. Obviously the main draw is the view which is pretty spectacular. My husband picked this place last night not knowing it was restaurant week but he'd been wanting to try it. I also will say upfront that I was in the restaurant industry for years, so I am probably pickier than most. We got there early intending to have a drink at the bar. We ended up having an appetizer as well, the tempura rock shrimp. Amazing! I could eat this all day long! One note to the bartenders, if a customer asks about what's in another customers drink or an ingredient maybe you should offer a drink instead of answering and immediately walking off. Around the time of our reservation we decided we better check the status because we weren't sure they were coming to get us from the bar (they knew where we were.) Not sure if it was good timing or a good decision but we were lead right to our table. Our server greeted us promptly and even got me a taste of the wine she thought I'd prefer. My husband decided to order off of the Queens Feast menu and I decided on just an entree since we had already had an appetizer. He opted for the pork chop and we were big fans of the char but it was over cooked and dry. I ate the Maine scallops which were really good but even better was the sweet potato grits underneath. I will be searching for a recipe for these grits for home! Hubs ordered the cheesecake and since I'm not a huge fan I ordered the candy bar dessert. It's probably in my top 10 of favorite desserts of all time! Bill was dropped off and we noticed gratuity had been added. Not sure if it was due to restaurant week or an all of the time occurrence. No big deal as we tip a minimum of 20% normally. One thing to keep an eye on though. You add your $10 valet charge to your bill. Our server added it and then the gratuity so she was getting tipped on the valet. We inquired as to whether she shares tips with them and she responded no and that she just hit the buttons in the wrong order. Quite possible but keep your eye on your bill if tip is included and you've valet parked. The ambiance, shrimp, and dessert pushed it to 4 stars. The staff, while courteous, seemed a bit aloof and robotic. We will go back but probably just for drinks, apps, and dessert when it's warm enough to really enjoy the view outside.",

We've heard iffy reviews here before but we still wanted to try it out and enjoy the view. Our server, Kevin, was great. He was extremely friendly and attentive. For our appetizer, we tried the wagyu buns and they weren't exactly what I was expecting but it was delicious. When I think of wagyu, I think of fatty meat but the texture was more similar to that of a stringy-like pork seen in bbq pork buns. However, it was a nice touch with the siracha. They should consider creating a special sauce for that dish to add a little twist to it. For dinner, my boyfriend got the pepperoni pizza. Very basic, but delicious. However, it was a little too salty for us. For my entree, I got the ribeye and it was amazing and perfectly cooked. It was big enough for the two of us. With all this, we had a lot of leftovers. Portion was great. I can't complain about the price because it's what to expect at a restaurant uptown in Charlotte like this with such a great view. Wish they had dessert but I didn't see any on the menu. Hope to go back soon!",

It is located in Uptown of Charlotte and is one of the highest floors in the hotel it is attached to. Due to this, it has incredible views of Uptown Charlotte. I only had a drink here (because of the prices) but someday I will go back and have the food, as it looked pretty darn good!

The drinks were incredible and very strong so we may return just for drinks on the deck.

After making a reservation, we still had to wait about 15-20 minutes (after we were told 5-10 minute wait) due to lack of glassware. We had a Funny Bus Tour after at 8pm, so we were tight on time already. By the time we sat down, we ordered immediately to get things moving. The waiter seemed a little out of it but got our order in and the food out in a reasonable amount of time. After that, we really never saw him again (about 20- 30 minutes after food arrived). We looked around to get the bill, but he was no where to be found. We had told him we were in a bot of a hurry, and the plates were clean. I got up and found the manager to give us our bill because other waiters ignore my signal as well. We finally got the bill and paid quickly.   It seems like there needs to be some work on the service end to make this place move up to 4+ stars because the location/view/menu are already up there.   I am happy we went because we got some beautiful rooftop views. Maybe it is better for Happy Hour after work to watch the sunset.",

You have to be dressed in business attire to eat in the dining room, but can be dressed casually for the rest of the place, but since a large part of it is an open floor plan and not separated out, it just doesn't make sense. So you have a mix of classy and casual all in the same area. I've had a couple items on the menu and nothing is particularly good. Most drinks are also pretty displeasing other than the mules.

With a condescending look we were told that in order to get a bottle we had to give them a form of payment. I questioned as I've been there before and this has never been the situation. I will never set foot in that restaurant. Felt ridiculices by the staff as if we could not afford a bottle of wine. Never will I give them my business.",

The tempura shrimp was had was outstanding, topped with a honey glaze and rice chips. EXCELLENT!

The place was packed with several large groups in the bar, and several tables with 6+. But despite that we were immediately sitted.   First yellow flag came when the server assigned to us was changed, for whatever reason, and we had to listen to the spiel all over again.   Then after ordering drinks and food, we received our second entree in 5 minutes - BEFORE the appetizers were even delivered. They went back to the kitchen and we got our appetizers.  At this point, they earned 2 stars, one for the martini which was out of this world of so good, and for the appetizers, delicious (egg rolls and grilled avocado).  We were not even done with the apps when we got again our entrees. As I suspect, the food was lukewarm. The lobster mac and cheese I could probably do bigger and better at home. The short ribs were on the dry side and a bit tougher than expected.   The whole meal was so very rushed, we even got our desserts without spoons and we had to stare at it for a few minutes before we got silverware to eat. We had toffee cake which was crunchier than I like. Also on the small side.  The coup-de-grace was the weather, clouds rolled in and we could not even enjoy the view as we could not see anything clear 100 yards on... I know this is not the restaurant's fault, but it damped our night.  Unfortunately the place is too expensive to try again and have another negative experience. Restaurant Week is meant to showcase a place to incentivize people to return for the full menu, but based on what we saw, we will not be coming back.",

I'm sorry but I'm already paying a premium here and $10 for a potato is insane.  2 stars for now because of this. I ordered the skirt steak that comes with the twice baked potato instead of the filet. Will update this once I've eaten.  I'm going to keep the 2 star review because I probably won't eat here again. The view is great, service is ok (my server was clearly green but she was trying and with some experience she may be a great server). My skirt steak was OK, a bit tough and stringy, which is why I wanted a filet instead, but the flavor was good and the cooked temp was perfect. My jaw is just a bit tired from chewing so much and it was hard to cut so not a very pleasant experience. Potatoes and Brussels were great so my only complaint is that I paid $55 for a tough stringy steak because they were going to charge me $10 to substitute a potato with the filet mignon  .",

The Bday girl really enjoyed her meal, which was the grilled salmon, so that's all that matters :)  Others had the pizza too. Fyi, that pizza is really huge lol. Two people can eat on that.

I went to Fahrenheit for restaurant week and got Crisp Calamari for the appetizer, Slow-Braised Kobe Beef Short Ribs for the entree and Meyer Lemon & Marcona Almond Mousse for dessert, all of which sounded amazing but left so much to be desired. The calamari was overly breaded and oily. The slow-braised Kobe beef was extremely dry and hard. The noodles that came with the short ribs were basic lo mein noodles that you could easily get at a fast food Chinese take-out place with 1/4 the price tag and 1000% more flavor. The mousse was room temperature and fell apart to a creamy pudding.   I would recommend coming here for drinks and the view, but don't waste your money on a luxurious price tag for a mediocre dining experience.",

Our waitress was not the nicest and towards the beginning of our dinner acted like she was being inconvenienced by our presence. Told my friend who wanted calamari and a side for her meal that they no offered side a la carte. Eventually, she was allowed to get what she wanted, but it shouldn't have been issue. It bothers me when large groups, where the gratuity is included, are met with sub par service. The food was okay.",

We came on a Friday night after dinner so we can just have some dessert and check out the views of the city. It's located on the 22 floor, pretty much at the top of the building. The views of the city are amazing. It really sets a nice ambience while you are dining. This is a nice place to go on a date. Our server was Kala. She was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and just food in general. She was also very enthusiastic, funny and attentive. She helped us with our dessert and drink selection. I ordered the adult milkshake chocolate flavor with a shot of Rumchata based on her recommendation and it was delicious. I literally could have finished it in one gulp but I wanted to savor the flavor as long as I could.  I can't really speak for any other food because I didn't try any but the ambience and service alone merit another visit. Be prepared though as this place is not cheap. However you cannot beat the view, which is probably the best in Charlotte.",

The experience started off great with the hostess on the phone.  Upon our arrival, We were escorted to a very nice seat by the window with a great view.  The server was not very attentive.  He joined us about 10 minutes after being seated.  The restaurant was not crowded.  We arrived at 5:45pm.     My husband had to ask for a water refill from the runner.  We then had to suggest to him to take our entree order?   After he picked up our appetizer plates and our entrees arrived, i had to ask for a dinner plate because he gave me a salad fork.    The calamari and salmon were both over cooked.  I was expecting someone from the management team to stop by since we complained about one dish and sent another back.  I mentioned to the general manager and management about how disappointed we were about the service and the food and they both responded the same, \"oh well.\"  As a small business owner, we weren't expecting any thing but an empathetic  acknowledgement of our dissatisfaction.  Needless to say, we won't be returning.",

I went here the the day after my bachelorette party before all of my out of town friends left.  We all loved the view and it was great for photos and to look over Charlotte.  The food selection for brunch was pretty good.  Everyone found something that they would enjoy.  Before coming here I had heard that the food wasn't the best, so I didn't have too high of expectations.  We were all given our food, except me. So all of my friends waited because our waiter said it's about to come out.  I told all of my friends to go ahead and eat so that their food wouldn't get cold.  Ten minutes go by and my waiter asks me what I had ordered again.  Ten minutes after that she offers me a free drink, and 15 minutes after that I get my food.  All of my friends had already had their plates taken away before I got my food.  I ended up having to get my food to go because my friends had to start heading to the airport.  The food wasn't the best but it was edible.  My fried egg was extremely salty and the breakfast sausage tasted more like a hot dog, but it was so spicy that I couldn't eat it (and I put jalapenos on my pizza).  I'll probably go back, but it would just be to get a drink or something.",

Both drinks were made beautifully but for a hefty bill. We headed outside through the door by the bar and straight away the beautiful fire on the patio reeked of gas, it did not smell safe. In general the turf out there made me feel like I was at a dog park and the seated area with mulch was not well taken care of, there were a bunch of weeds. Overall, this place is better on instagram. Great to come and see the view and take a picture, and I think the staff knows it. Really weird vibes from all of the employees, probably because they were about to close. While we were leaving an employee was telling a story about patrons (from what I could overhear) to two police officers, adding to the weird vibe. It was a very strange experience.",

The steaks are always on point and drink selection is superb. Serving sizes are all over the place- I'm a petite person, but the scallops dish is laughably small. I ordered a whole extra entree that night, while it was delicious, it should creep it's way to the appetizer side of the menu. Last night we were recommended the \"Charlotte Nachos\" and I couldn't have felt more foolish eating cold potato chips and barely melted cheese. We took one bite, and pushed it aside. It actually arrived before my drink did. But they earned a five from me, the server could not have been kinder and somehow or another that appetizer didn't make it on our bill. We couldn't have been more shocked, we had full intentions of paying for the item (as we had ordered it) and just steering clear of it in the future (or going with our gut, the Ahi Poke Nachos, so dang good). The night ended with some fabulous wine and scotch, a beautiful look at the city, and a genuine \"thank you for dining with us\" from the server, Danae. I recommend this place to all of my friends and clients traveling through the city. But beware- like most fine dining, portions can be less than generous at time.",

    "text": "Fahrenheit's average 3-star rating is absolutely on par.  I agree with the 3-star rating because: the ambiance is a little on the underwhelming side (3 stars); the service is mediocre (3 stars); and the food is flavorful with big portions (4 stars).   Overall, I'm glad that we went once but wouldn't return or bring guests for the dining experience.    Underwhelming ambiance.  Fahrenheit is located in a Hyatt Hotel, right below where their condos start.  One of its selling features is showcasing the downtown skyline; however, we live on the 41st floor in a high rise downtown and our daily views are much more stunning and breathtaking.  Although the restaurant makes an attempt to be hip and trendy, its already outdated contemporary furnishings fall flat.  The restaurant is intentionally dimly lit to highlight the skyline views but the lack of periphery ambient lighting errs on the side of overly dim.    The night that we came, it was stormy and unseasonably cold; therefore, the patio wasn't really occupied.  Inside the restaurant was frigid cold, so uncomfortable that it really hampered our dining experience.  When we mentioned it to the waitstaff, they told us that there was nothing that could be done and if WE were cold, imagine how freezing THEY were since the air vents are directly over their work stations.  I get the concept of commiseration, truly, but I'm not getting paid to be there, I am a PAYING patron.  It doesn't make me feel any better that others are just as cold as I am; it actually makes me feel worse that the restaurant is aware of the condition but can't pull themselves together to alleviate the situation on behalf of their patrons.  Mediocre service.  The staff is as friendly, courteous and prompt as you would expect from a nicer establishment such as this.  Therefore, meeting the benchmark among your peers just says you're doing what is expected, which is exactly what you get here.  I would certainly say that the waitstaff leans on the side of facilitating quick turnover.  They hovered over us throughout our meal, darting for near-empty plates, making the meal feel unnecessarily rushed.    However, one noteworthy point to mention is when our waitress told us about the \"mouth-watering lobster special, which was stuffed with fresh crabmeat and then buttery, sweet lobster cooked to perfection placed on top of the crab.\"  Well when you put it that way, of course we're in!  After the waitress piqued our appetites with the vivid description, she returned to inform us that they had sold out of the lobster special.  Really!?  NOW you find out its availability after your entire spiel, pushing the lobster special like its the culinary delight of the century?  It all turned out to be a big tease because ordering the Kobe beef short ribs felt like going home with the second hottest guy/girl -- you know there was something better within your grasp but you just couldn't get to it soon enough...  The drinks were delicious.  We had the Moscow mule and I asked the bartender to create a concoction with pineapple juice, grenadine, Sprite, and a raspberry or citrus vodka with Cointreau.  It came out superb and had just the right amount of alcohol not to drown out the sweetness.  Flavorful food in surprisingly large portions.  There is definitely something to be said when establishments serve courses in large portions, so kudos to Fahrenheit for this!  We had: ------------DELICIOUS (wouldn't miss this): ++  crispy rock shrimp.  The creamy honey glazed sauce had just the right hint of sriracha to make it the right balance of spicy and sweet.  The shrimp had the right proportion of crispiness from the breading to the succulence from the shrimp. ------------GOOD (tasty enough but I would try something else if I returned): ++  kale and brussel sprouts salad.  This salad was sprinkled with candied nuts, cheese and cranberries, and I asked them to add apples to it (the brussel sprouts salad on the menu had apples on it), served with a sweet vinaigrette.  It was delicious and served in a large enough portion that my boyfriend and I shared but could not finish.   ++  Kobe beef short rib steamed buns.  The Kobe beef short ribs are marinated in a sweet sauce and served with sriracha on the side.  When the buns arrived, the bottom was soggy, which really deterred from this course.  Also, the bun to beef ratio was pretty small so you had a lot more bun leftover. ++  Kobe short ribs.  The short ribs were tender and moist, marinated in a similar sweet sauce as the beef from the steamed buns, served over lo mein noodles.  We really wanted to like Fahrenheit, especially considering that making reservations is not as readily available as you would expect.  However, everything about the dining experience as a whole just left us feeling unimpressed.  Ultimately, there was nothing remarkable about the experience that would compel us to come back or even to bring out-of-town guests (see my review for WP24 in LA).",

And the place is really nice inside, until people start arriving.  On a weeknight when one wouldn't expect it to be that busy, it was full and the noise inside the restaurant was deafening.  I've never been in a very high priced restaurant where the noise level was that bad.  You also have very limited parking options.  Either go with the valet parking or hike for several blocks.  I honestly would never go here for a \"date\" because there is no way you could carry on a conversation without shouting.  It was pretty shocking.",

It's at the top of a hotel/condominium building, and there was a Carolina football game going on that night so we had a view of the city. Carolina folks are really into their football team, so the buildings were all lit up in the Carolina blue. It was beautiful. I didn't get there in time to sit down and enjoy a cocktail on the patio before dinner, but the patio seemed really casual and relaxed. You could easily head up there for a drink without doing dinner.",

They had a good beer selection and a great maple bourbon cocktail with candied bacon. Service was ok. I'd probably opt for something more unique next time.",

Came here on Saturday night around 11 pm after noticing a lot of the other rooftop bars had lines out the door and around the building. The people here are really nice (bouncers/security). Parked outside of Hyatt Place was a Lamborghini so this must be the spot! Anyways, as soon as we reached the rooftop, we ordered 2 drinks - Mango Madness and I forget the other one. But, Mango Madness was a Mango flavored Moscow Mule and it was delicious! Drinks are a bit on the pricey end but aren't all rooftops?  One half of the rooftop was jam packed with people at tables and the other half (where the fire pit was) was SUPER empty. The downside of this side was that there was only 1 table and only 5 chairs. We quickly grabbed 2 chairs and placed them in front of the fire pit and were able to talk & enjoy the beautiful view. There was no one near us at first, but somehow people ended up near us after noticing how comfy & unbothered we were! Definitely recommend if you want to get away from the crowded places!",

    "text": "Overall it was a good experience. The food was great (the surf and turf skewer special was very tasty) and they had a nice variety of food and drink options. Service was slower than I expected, even though I understand fine dining takes longer in general. I didn't get an alcoholic drink until 45 minutes after I arrived (couldn't make the drink I first requested, server didn't tell me until about 15 minutes after I ordered it, still took about 10-15 minutes to get a glass of champagne after that). I asked the server if the side item for the filet had cheese in it, just to clarify since I am lactose intolerant, and he said there was not so I ordered the entree as is. The side definitely had cheese in it, I spoke to a manager and he got me another side (broccolini which was delicious). The server got me a glass of Prosecco on the house for the inconvenience.   Like I said, overall it was a good experience mainly because of the food but there were definitely points where I thought the server could have been proactive to avoid some of the mishaps we experienced. For the price, I would consider venturing out to other fine dining restaurants around the city before I came back for dinner but will be back for drinks and brunch.",

Such a wonderful site.  We weren't early enough to get an outside table but still enjoyed our stroll around the open air terrace.  It's obviously a popular spot for the sunset so it would suggest if that is your plan make sure you're there well in advance of sunset time.   We found a table just inside the doors of the lounge so the view was just as enjoyable.  We were very pleased with our drink choice.  I went with the specialty drink Crimson Days.  Fruity yet not too sweet.  My man enjoyed one his favorite local IPA Legion Juicy Jay.  Fahrenheit provided a great start to our evening.   Although I thought the drinks a bit too pricey, we were glad we went and experienced the beautiful view the Queen City offered us tonight.",

    "text": "Curious to see more of CLT's skyline, we ventured to Farenheit to check out their rooftop bar. It did not disappoint. WOW!! It was breathtaking! I would even go as far as to say that their view is better than the new, swanky rooftop bar down the street, Merchant and Trade's. Personally, I think there is more of a \"view\" here. Plenty of areas for a great scenic photo op. Nice, large fire pits. Not much seating outside, though. If it weren't so cold and windy that day, we would have stayed longer to enjoy the view.  I knocked off two stars for their drinks. My SO and I ordered a cocktail each and our total bill came to $30+! He ordered an old fashioned and I a pineapple upside down cake martini. They were good and strong, but definitely not worth the price. We stayed to finish our drinks and then left.   I am however, intrigued by their menu. Enough to consider returning to try their food. The restaurant was pretty busy for a Saturday before Christmas. The two places we went to before making our way here were slow. More people arrived when we left around 10pm. Plus, the staff was friendly. We took an uber both ways, so I can't speak for the parking situation.",

The view is great and the cocktails were good. We were led to a table that had no view, but at my request a window table (not viewing Uptown) was cleared for us. Our server Nicole H was sweet and professional. We selected the calamari and cauliflower as starters. Both had too much breading and the cauliflower was soggy. Our entrees were the salmon and lobster Mac n cheese. Salmon was too salty. The pasta dish should have been named \"ziti with a little lobster alla vodka sauce\". It was soupy, not thick and cheesy like other lobster Mac n cheese that I've enjoyed. The desserts were dark chocolate cake and salted caramel blondie. The cake was similar to an easy bake oven cake and the caramel sauce on the brick-hard blondie wasn't salty.   I would say this was a fail. We would only come back to Fahrenheit for a beer on the outside deck. Cocktails are $16 a piece.",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant about two months ago and never wrote a review, however I still think of how WEIRD of an experience we had and thought I should share. My boyfriend and I made reservations here on a Friday night because it is one of the best views of the sun setting on the city. When we got there our table wasn't ready yet, which was no problem so we had some drinks at the bar. The drinks were great and the bartenders were absolutely lovely. The restaurant is split into two sides just normal dining and then a private party area, the private party had children running and yelling in and out of the bar and waiting area and bumping into guests. This isn't the restaurants fault it's just unusual that an \"upscale\" restaurant would allow this. We get seated and have an amazing view of the skyline and order some appetizers which were just okay and then order entrees. About half way through our entrees the manager comes up and asks my boyfriend to remove his hat, (his hat shouldn't have been at dinner, on that was totally our bad but the restaurant honestly just didn't seem that \"upscale\" so that was our oversight) if she would have left it at that it would've been totally fine he shouldn't have his hat on at dinner, I agree. But instead she makes this big scene about \"God bless America\" and \"Support our troops\" and does this weird salute/ hail Hitler type deal and at this point people are staring and shes just keeping on with this act and I'm honestly afraid she's going to start singing the star spangled banner at our table. Neither one of us our military, his hat had a small American flag on it that she made into a production. He should've been asked to remove his hat and that should've been the end of it. Then after we're done eating our two separate entrees she comes over and asks if we need separate plates so we don't have to eat out of the same pasta bowl, even though we were finished eating... our service was great, our food was honestly just not good at all and this manager made our visit extremely weird and uncomfortable and she needs to be addressed before she becomes a PR nightmare.",

    "text": "I was in town for some business and my colleagues arranged for us to dine there. I had heard a lot about the view and was looking forward to experiencing the atmosphere, but had low expectations otherwise, given the mixed reviews.  I attended a group dinner as part of a large party and found the service overall to be good, especially considering how difficult it is to serve a table of 12. The view is great and the service was friendly and accommodating. The food was mediocre considering how overpriced it was and wasn't worth it.  We ordered a four different appetizers, all of them were fair to decent, with the ahi tuna being the standout. Relatively speaking they weren't that memorable. The house salad was fairly basic, which was disappointing, given it was a $13 item and wasn't anything special. I only ate a small amount of it because it was so over-salted that I couldn't eat more than a few bites.  I was really looking forward to the short ribs and was truly disappointed when they arrived. They were served over some low mein and seasoned with soy. It looked great on the plate but the chopsticks I was provided weren't of much use, since the short ribs were about 60% fat and I had to use a knife and fork to cut away a majority of my meal due to it being so laden with fat. The meat was so rubbery, it wasn't the usual short rib experience I am used to, where the meat peels off easily.  In the end, it was not worth it, and I if I hadn't been there for a group dinner, I would have listened to my fellow Yelpers and found another place to eat.  I actually left hungry and went to Five Guys later that evening, which was far more satisfying that Fahrenheit. That's a sad statement considering Fahrenheit runs at least $125 a person when you consider apps, salad, entree and a drink.  There are plenty of great options in Charlotte, Farenheit isn't one of them. If you want to check out the view, go to the bar and get a drink, but find another place to enjoy a nice meal.",

Food both times was delicious!  Great menu and presentation was impressive!  AND, of course, the VIEW!!  What a sunset!  Fun to order a bunch of appetizers!  All were great!  Would probably skip what they call \"Nachos\" next time.  Plate full of fried potato slices (chips) with cheese sauce drizzled over it.  Just too much.  Save your appetite for all the other delicious menu items!  Get a seat by the window if possible.  The bar is great too!  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!",

I ended up ordering the cauliflower ($9) which was dressed up in oil, few capers & slithers of Parmesan cheese....definitely not work the $9 and tax and tip on top of that. I was told by the waiter the chef can make a vegetarian lo mein, however I wasn't going to pay $25 (I'm guessing that's how much it would have been) for noodles and veggies.  I'm all about paying money for delicious food (vegetarian) but just because a top chef is making the food doesn't mean its the best for everyone.  The girls at the table ordered salmon and scallops which they loved, so I would recommend it to the meat eaters out there, if they are willing to put out the cash. The view of the city was nice but that's about all for me.  And yes, the drink prices are also expensive and dessert menu is bleak.  I agree with another review about Fahrenheit being the hype of Charlotte but doesn't meet the expectations. One more thing, if you do valet parking you'll pay $7 for it.  I will not be returning to this place for dinner or drinks.",

The waitress never asked us if we wanted another drink until the end of the meal.  The food is overpriced and mediocre at best, and it took them  a good 30 minutes to figure out our checks.  The waitress had to print our tickets three separate times to finally get them right.  There are a lot of great spots to eat in Charlotte, and this is not one of them!

Our food was extremely salty or extremely sweet - my appetizer (sausage, gravy & biscuits) was simply doused in salt which completely ruined the taste and meal, and my entree (chicken with mashed sweet potatoes) was absolutely covered in caramel sauce. We waited for our check for over 20 minutes- I think they forgot about us, we had to remind them that we were still there & needed to pay. Before we had dinner, we had a few drinks on the outside patio - that was great. I would go back for drinks but definitely not for the food. I was really really disappointed in the quality of the food. I'm surprised at the astounding prices for the low quality.",

The restaurant was basically empty when we got there, yet the crammed us into tables that all touched. I understand keeping people central for servers but this seemed a little much to be bumping people behind you when there was clearly space in the area to sit people with more room. The real let down was the actual food, as we were ordering the people next to us were complaining about their meals, we didn't think too much of it and ordered the cheddar biscuits- which were very good! (at least to me a Boston Native who hasn't had her share of biscuits yet!) Then our meals came, I got the BAE- which was disappointing, it was a breakfast sandwich I could have made at home and a mediocre one at that. The sandwich also said it had cheese on it which mine didn't so it was basically eggs in-between store bought bread with a slice of avocado. My Fiances meal- the Eggs Benedict Carbonara, was okay but nothing to write home about. I would try this restaurant again but not for a meal, the bar area seems great and would more then likely come in to enjoy the few and a few drinks on a nicer night on their patio.",

My first impression was the drink I got from the bar while waiting for the rest of my party to arrive. It was the Cucumber Hibiscus Collins and it was delicious-this is the only enjoyable part of my night and the only reason for two stars.  Once all of my party arrived, we were whisked to a back room that looked like a large conference room in any ordinary hotel. There were stock photos of the Wells Fargo Building on the wall, conference chairs, bad lighting, and zero ambiance.  We expressed our displeasure with the hostess and was not offered any legitimate reason for the separate room except it was for \"large parties.\"  The view was not of uptown but of the Target and Independence Expressway.  When you are ordering $40+ entrees for a special night out, the ambiance is everything, and it was not what we wanted or expected for a girls' night out. To top everything off, it took 40 minutes for our initial drink order to come, service was slow and unapologetic, and it took another 45 minutes for our waitress to split our check.

My short ribs were over barked and somewhat tough.  The flavors were there in the overall dish but the meat left something to be desired. The scallops and accompaniments were again well flavored but lukewarm to cool at best.  The lamb was again overcooked and served cool.  The salads kale and calamari were all very good.  The bar area, which you see as soon as you walk in looks fun and upscale.  Our dining room however was spartan and sterile with barren walls looking more like it was a restaurant in the Hyatt Place than an upscale eatery atop a uptown building.  Maybe it was the newness but Fahrenheit left us feeling a few degrees short of warm.  I will give it a month to work out the kinks and give it one more chance.",

I've had the opportunity to dine here a couple times and I have more positives than negatives to share about the place. Great ambiance if you're looking for a loud, lively venue, and a nice view of the city. They have a pretty nice cocktail menu and an alright list of wines by the glass. The food - some items are great, and some mediocre. I was not impressed with their ahi tuna or cauliflower appetizers, but I did enjoy the chorizo stuffed dates! The kale salad was a good size, but lacked in flavor. In the main course the halibut was absolutely delicious, the spice grilled lamb loin was great but the king crab ramen was kinda boring (I had high expectations from this dish!). The fungi pizza was yum, and oh I almost forgot to mention the honey whipped herb butter that comes with the bread - amazing. And finally, the rice pudding dessert was less than memorable. All in all I think there were some amazing items on the menu, while there were some that weren't worth the high $$ you were paying! I'd recommend this restaurant for a good weekend dinner with friends or family, a celebratory get together perhaps, or perhaps for their chic bar if you're looking for a hip place to enjoy a few Cocktails!",

For a restaurant of this price range, I typically expect something to be amazing but that didn't happen. We also had cocktails--the spicy Charlotte and whiskey business. They were interesting but again not something I would go back for.  As far as the atmosphere --it seemed night club like. A lot of the decor looked kinda cheap and like it would look much better in dim lighting. Again this seemed weird for a high end restaurant.   Overall, I think this place has a lot of potential but for right now I would just go back for the view. Maybe this place is better outside of restaurant week but in my opinion they should try to serve something that temps you to come back.",

Tonight was my third time eating here and despite making a reservation, we were not sat for another hour and 10 minutes. We got drinks at the bar, which we waited 20 minutes alone just for someone to say something to us, AT THE BAR. But I give the place 3 stars, actually 3.5 because the view is unbeatable, honestly. And the food truly is good. But the price is insane because there IS better. I keep coming back because of the view and ideal location for birthdays and holidays, but boy do they make it tough sometimes.",

    "text": "Great views with sky high prices to match, but I felt the food and atmosphere did make the final bill worth it.   We had a Sunday night meal here which meant fewer people and a more coordinated effort from the kitchen. Our server was Kevin and he was excellent and hilarious. We started with chorizo stuffed dates and crispy cauliflower. The dates were not only stuffed but also bacon wrapped bites of pure heaven. This dish is highly recommended. The cauliflower was meh and not worth mentioning.   For main courses we had the salmon, pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped scallops special, lamb loin and wild mushroom pizza. Portions are HUGE. Seriously, where were some of the other reviewers on here eating? The pizza was nearly an 18\" pie; salmon was a generous size on a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes. Pork tenderloin had a sweet flavor w sweet potato mash and a bourbon sauce. We estimated the lamb loin to be at least 10 ozs and it came with fries as well. The scallops were the only normal sized dish and came w three to a plate on a bed of risotto. Everything was tasty, well cooked and well presented - even the pie which had a chewy crust and truffle oil. We ended our meal with the chocolate pot de creme. This was a large souffle dish of cold, rich chocolate creme topped w a caramel popcorn ball which oddly worked really well w the chocolate.   You might wonder why not five stars after all this raving? The reality is the food and service is solid, but not memorable. There wasn't a dish that made me feel like I had to come back again (except the dates!) especially with those price tags. This is the kind of place I would recommend visiting once to experience especially for the views, but there are other places in Charlotte that merit repeat visits.",

The wood grilled avocado was my fave; the toast came with a goat cheese spread and like a sweet drizzle, it was amazing; would recommend getting this. One of my friends is vegan, so the pizza was an arugula and onion pizza, no cheese, and it was still good. My gf said her cocktail was one of the best she's ever had.

Oh, and look past those there to be seen rather than dine ;-)  My better half and I made a reservation for a Friday evening and had a wonderful time. The only hitch was at the beginning of the evening when we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Someone needs to fix the scheduling/booking system.  Fahrenheit seems to have attracted mixed reviews here on Yelp which could mean a mis-alignment of expectations or highly variable food quality.  All of our food was very good and bursting with flavor. Our server was great and yes, the view was superb.  Based on our recent experience I definitely recommend Fahrenheit and would return.",

I went with my wife during Charlotte's Restaurant Week to take advantage of the 3 courses for $30. The chicken wings confit were delicious, and had a GREAT flavor. The calamari was also awesome. I was very under-whelmed with the hanger steak entree. I understand they're busy during RW .. but you would think they'd want to serve exceptional food to make sure customers come back on a normal night. This was not the case, and I don't think I'll be back again for the food.   The view is one of the best in Charlotte, but you definitely pay for it (literally ... you have to pay $10 to park in the hotel).

You get a clear view of Charlotte's sky line condos and high rise buildings downtown, while on the other side of the rooftop you see people sunbathing in bathing suits on the roof. Such a cool upscale concept . My friend has been bragging and boasting so much about the shrimp here so i finally decided to join her for lunch yesterday and try them  out. Everything definitely met my expectations from the ambiance of Fahrenheit, to the food,drinks, and view. The crispy tempura rock shrimp won my vote for presentation, and taste. Our bartender was awesome and very knowledgeable about the drinks and what ingredients were in each. After seeing so many people  ordering the Saturday savior i decided that's what i wanted to order because it must be good the way everyone at the bar was continuously ordering it. It reminded me of a coffee and thin mints unique flavor and milky. One thing i do know is it was very strong because i was feeling some type of way after just one drink which is unusual for me. So im  sure that wins a lot of patrons votes. I also ended up ordering one of their signature custom mules you cant ever go wrong with a mule i feel.First light mule is the one i decided to order. Fahrenheit won be over for my go to summer hang outs this year for appetizers and drinks!  In my Arnold Schwarzenegger voice. \"Ill be back\" !",

The nachos were very filling but good, basically chips with cheese, green onion, and bacon loaded on top. The sticky buns were good too, they had a type of brisket inside with veggies. One of them was a little soggy the bottom. We were celebrating my sister's birthday and our waiter, Hannah, brought her a birthday surprise, a ice cream sundae. Very nice of her. They do have plenty of TVs to watch any sports game on. Will definitely come back for the views.",

I'm not sure how they charge so much on the regular menu for entrees that are less than okay.  The point of restaurant week is to entice you to come back however we will not be back.",

Here is my take having sampled several dishes during a large work dinner yesterday:   --- Must order - Ahi Poke Nachos, Crispy Tempura Rock Shrimp, Crispy Calamari.  My favorite was the ahi poke - the tuna was melt-in-your-mouth fresh, the nachos nice and crispy.   --- Good - Grilled Kurobuta Pork Chop, Kobe Beef Short Rib Steamed Buns.  They'd made my pork-chop medium-rare, which was the right call. The rice they served with it was divine!   --- Meh - Maine Diver Scallops, Chorizo stuffed dates.  Wish the scallops were cooked a tad bit longer, the chorizo not as long.   --- Don't bother - Charlotte Nachos, No.1 Contender Cocktail.   Service was acceptable - they filled my water glass regularly (makes me happy), but tried to take my plate away often (makes me sad).   Worth going to for the views, as long as you order selectively.",

She didn't do anything spectacular and I normally like for my waiter to be more personable. I didn't know anything about her and she didn't ask any questions about me.    I will say that the customers here were really nice. I enjoyed the clientele here more than I enjoyed the staff. Everybody wanted to get a good picture because of the view.  Luckily I was here during restaurant week and I got a chance to enjoy what was on the menu. The food was very good I must admit. Looking at the previous comments I saw that it was pretty expensive for the food but I enjoyed the choices for restaurant week.",

No side came with the meal so we had to purchase an additional side which we got potatoes. They came out dry and luke warm as well.  I asked to speak to a manager addressing the biscuits. I asked her if they were made recently bc they tasted stale and she told me they were made this Am. It's 2:00 in the afternoon and your charging  18.00 for a plate with a biscuit that was made in the Am?! I don't understand why you wouldn't make them hourly at least. My food tasted  like it was under a heat lamp all am and we were sent out left overs. We are foodies and can assure you this place is smoke and mirrors which is sad bc it's a beautiful space.

We we were in a little bit of a time crunch, and with luggage it was a bit tricky.  Fortunately, the hotel stowed our luggage as we made our way to the 21st floor. The view from up there is quite nice, but there was a huge party of at least 35 people celebrating someone's 81st birthday and a wedding engagement. Someone from that party offered their apologies and offered us drinks on them, which was very thoughtful, but we weren't drinking.  We explained our situation about the flight and the waitress accommodated us and rushed our orders. For starters, we had Kung Pao chicken wings and chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. Both fantastic, but the dates were my favorite.  For the main course we had a rack of lamb and a lo mein wagyu short rib. Once again, both great dishes. Finally for dessert we had the Fahrenheit bar and the cookies and cream torte. You guessed it, equally fantastic.  What could make this meal better? The fact that the party decided to pay for our meal. Such a nice thing to do, and I had to thank them multiple times because it was really unnecessary (they were not wild, intrusive, or crazy at all).   So it was a great meal and a good way to leave the east coast.",

I didnt really have a whole lot of time so even though this was 3 stars, i saw some positive reviews and thought this might be nice because I could sit up on the patio and at least take in a nice view of charlotte. The patio was honestly ok- I had a nice view of the surrounding buildings which wasnt much to write home about. I have to abstain from alcohol right now so I was trying to look for virgin cocktails or just non-alcoholic drinks and there were literally none. Not even like a virgin bloody mary. From their \"vegetarian menu\", I got the charlotte nachos without bacon which were basically potato chips with queso and cheddar with a little bit of scallions. It was so salty. It was $15 for a huge portion but so not worth it. The atmosphere is pretty - gorgeous interior. kind of a business-bar vibe. A lot of folks getting together for after conference dinner and drinks. Service was nice. Thats really what i am giving 3 stars for, which I honestly think is kind of generous.",

They have a nice selection or local brews. As for the menu, it's definitely pricey but not a surprise given the phenomenal location with sweeping views of downtown Charlotte. The flat bread pizza were delicious. Vegetables, meats and cheese of high quality were used. The tuna in crispy wonton was also but be warned, the chili sauce on top of it was fire!! For entrees had the bone in rib eye which was flavorful but a little over cooked. My friends had the lobster Mac and cheese, seared tuna, the Kobe short ribs and pork shank. All in all the food was very flavorful and delicious. There were some execution errors on a few but that is expected with a restaurant that just opened its door doing their first test run. Would I recommend this restaurant?!! Of course, I'm sure Rocco and staff will get the kinks worked out very soon and the food will be on point. As for the place to seen and be seen, I think Charlotte has just recently opened up its new location with Fahrenheit.",

My wife was not happy! The mozzarella was clumpy. If they are using that type of mozzarella - shred it. I'll go back, but not for pizza.",

    "text": "I have never dined at this restaurant so my one star is based on customer service from the below experience. On Saturday, December 10, around 9:30 PM (east coast time), I was at home in Northern California when I received an alert on my phone that my debit card was used at this restaurant. An employee processed my Debit card for the amount of $28.15. I called that evening and was told an employee would call me in the morning which I never received. I called later on Sunday, December 11, 2016 and the receptionists advised me that there system was slow and when it came back up, she would call me which she never did. I called on Monday, December 12, 2016 and spoke with the Monday receptionist at 11:00 AM who  took my message and advised me she would have the manager call me which he never did. I called at 5:30 PM Tuesday December 13, 2016 and talked to the receptionists who knew me by name and stated that both managers were in and she was going into their office after she hung up and make sure they received my message and to expect a call that evening which I never received. I woke up this morning and found the $28.15 pending charge now rose to $38.15. (Someone added a $10 tip). On Wednesday I sent an email to the business, left another message on the phone and messaged Chef Rocco Whalen on his Facebook about this and still no response.This has caused me to cancel my debit card, requiring me to contact all my online billing accounts to have the new account posted and file an affidavit with my bank. Highly recommend that if you do dine here, use cash or a credit card to avoid my experience.",

Having seen previous reviews I assumed there was patio seating for dinner - but the patio is more if a chill spot for before or after your dinner. The only part of the night that was a downer was the disorganization   at the hostess station. We arrived 30 mins early and it took them 5 mins just to enter that we had arrived.  There were many empty tables and we were told just a few minutes we would be seated. We went to the bar and after laughing and talking we realized an hour had gone by. Instead of getting upset we just ordered dinner at the bar...15 mins later we got a txt saying our table was ready. After dinner we told them about our disappointment and their repose was \" we forgot, sorry\". But we enjoyed ourselves just the same and would give them another try.",

Not sure what other places in the city I would compare it to, being that I was only in for a business trip, but I would venture to say it was the best pizza I have had in a long time. The fig ol fashioned off of their cocktail menu is to die for and the local beer I chose was the birdsong higher ground IPA which paired amazingly with my pepperoni pizza. Next time I'm in town I will defiantly be stopping here. If not only for the amazing view of the city then for another amazing pie!",

Which i think is wasteful :( i ordered the goat cheese salad and as we are enjoying it they already brought our main course literally without letting us take our time and enjoy our appetizers.  My husband had the 45 day steak and thought it was average and per our bartenders suggestion i had the scallops and lobster mash which was delicious.

I had the Spicy Charlotte and it was SO GOOD! Not to sweet and ends with a kick. For our appetizers we had the seared ahi tuna and vietnamese spring rolls. The tuna was good quality, and prepared as expected; however, the vietnamese spring rolls were not quite what I had in mind. They had curry flavoring which isn't what I would consider a traditional vietnamese spring roll - even though I was surprised, and they were incredibly spicy, they were also very good. For my dinner, I had the halibut. This dish was less than impressive. I didn't think the grapefruit/pickled fennel/arugula/potato/halibut combo was all that pleasing. I left most of my dry halibut and dry potatoes on the plate. Finally, we opted for the \"special\" for dessert which was chocolate chip donut holes; and, I ordered one of their four port options. Unfortunately, the server came back and indicated that only the most expensive one of the four ports were still available, so I opted out of that... Then, he came back and let us know that they were out of donut holes. It was a Monday night, 9:30PM, house made donut holes - gone. So, we opted out of that... The server was very apologetic, he had only been there for three weeks. However, he's not likely to stick around if he has customers trying to buy things from him, but the kitchen and bar areas aren't prepared to support their menu.",

    "text": "Really really really disappointed.   My wife and I moved here about 5 years ago and always had this place on our bucket list. We finally got around to making a reservation and made the 40 minute drive from Mooresville. We got to the top of the building and were greeted by a friendly wait staff that invited us to have a drink while we waited for the rest of our party - a couple that we hadn't seen in a while. After a couple $15 dollar drinks, we made our way to the table. The waitress was friendly but distant and pressured us into some \"organic\" water that was distilled infinitely (?). We denied but she ended up charging us for it anyway. It was $1, I have a hard time complaining about that.    The menu was so-so and I had a hard time finding something that I fell in love with. I asked the waitress if there were any features and she told me they were out... Which was strange because it was 6:00 at night, and it wasn't that busy. I settled on the flank steak with a Brussel sprout appetizer (I love Brussel sprouts).  My first course came out and let's just say I would have rather eaten a dish of raw Rosemary. The Brussel sprouts were cut like cole slaw and served with a peanuty vinegar. I felt like a rabbit and for the first time in my life, I couldn't bear to finish the dish.   My flank steak arrived with a cup full of French fries and a stalk of uncooked broccoli. Steak was cut already which I found strange and not well marinated. The fries were the best part, albeit salty.   Dessert time came and I stayed away.. I couldn't bear getting disappointed again. I stuck with a mediocre cup of coffee which must have been Folgers or some other generic brand. Im actually really sad about this meal, I really wanted to have a good meal with my friends. Instead I felt motivated to write this melancholy review on Yelp.   We ended up paying $200 for this meal which is heftier than we had planned for two people. I don't mind paying that kind of money for a tremendous meal, but I would have gotten a better meal at Applebee's. Do yourself a favor, stop at Fahrenheit for a drink, go elsewhere for dinner.",

I reserved in advance and requested a seat near the window since I was excited for the view of Charlotte since I am from out of the state. We arrived and were seated promptly at a seat three tables deep away from the window. We were informed the entire window area had been bought out. Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Just as our meals arrived the group who bought out every window facing table arrived. At least 32 people in the dining room after already loosening up and getting loud at the bar. It was ear piercingly loud and my husband and I couldn't even think, let alone converse. I felt bad for another couple we saw arrive and get seated directly next to them trying to celebrate a special occasion. Aside from that I just didn't get the the food flavors. I'm not a picky eater, but the shirt rubbed steamed buns and chorizo stuffed figs were just a combination of string flavors I didn't think complimented each other. We also ordered the nachos, which was a ginormous plate of potato chips with a tiny bit of cheese and some sparingly added pieces of bacon, for about $14. All in all disappointed that this was our experience here on our trip to Charlotte.",

But I'm going to say that it surprised me as I thought the food was pretty good. We all shared appetizers. Chorizo stuffed dates, steamed mussels, pork belly buns, and fried oysters.    I'll say the mussels were literally the best I've ever had. The curry broth was a bit sweet for me. But what made them was that they were steamed perfectly. And fresh!  They were soft, and succulent. I've NEVER had mussels with texture like that. I usually expect kinda rubbery, not hard, but not soft. These were another category in quality altogether.   And wine; they had a decent wine list. Not much selection by the glass, the list pushes you to get a bottle.   Their view is not because of the height of the hotel. The view is good of Charlotte as their skyline looks toward the skyscrapers of the inner city. If you were on the skyscrapers in the inner fort, which are taller than Fahrenheit, you'd see out onto no skyscrapers and look into the rooftops of lower buildings at the edge of the city.  They could use improvement for sure. Handle the noise issue. Better arrange the view from tables. Use more professional trained staff. It has kind of a night club feel, without the music.",

Our server acted like he was annoyed the whole time and actually walked away twice when in the middle ordering a round of drinks. When the food came out, my husbands filet mignon was extremely over cooked yet our server did not come to check on us until everyone finished their meal. The whole experience was very disappointing as it is clear that they are using their chefs name for the success as that was the first thing the server mentioned when he came to our table..the chef who was not even in the restaurant.

Really, the only thing this place has going for it is location and skyline view, if your lucky enough to be seated anywhere near a view.  My wife made the reservation noting a special occasion. Our table(diner wobbly) was against a lighted column with a great view of another couple who was oddly seated against a outer wall beam.  Lots of glass available, but even their table didn't have a view.  Behind us was a large party which meant noise...understandable, but as the we waited to give our drink and app order the restaurant filled and the noise level went to 11.  The waitress had to bend down and basically yell.    Realizing this was not going to be an ideal/relaxing dinner we ordered a bottle of the Jordan$65...served a warm $115Jordan.  Not only was it warm, the waitress pretty much used our glasses as decanters...filled half way...couldn't swirl.  While observing other staff, it became obvious this was a very young, inexperienced group of people.  I ordered the short rib...good, but a garlic salt bomb which lingers until the next morning.  My wife ordered the porkchop...good but dry.  Dessert...ordered some type of chocolate pnutbutter ice cream candy bar that was delicious, but nothing signature or creative.  When it was time for the check the restaurant was at a roar.  I mean loud!  So much so, the waitress offered no pleasantries when delivering the check.  Super transactional feel.  I feel no need to return or bring clients.  It's a low-end establishment pretending to be a 5star, based on high $ cabs on the wine list.  Thankfully, CLT has much better dining experiences and close bye.",

    "text": "Well where do I start. I made reservations for my husbands birthday. I specifically asked to be seated by the window. Also told them that we wouldn't mind waiting when we got there for a window seat. The lady I talked to on the phone had a 5:15 and a 8:45 reservation.  I was surprised that they had a 8:45 when online it said they closed at 9:00. I questioned the lady about it and she told me that 11:00 was when they closed. So we went with the 8:45 reservation. I asked them what did they do for birthdays and she told me that they would bring him out a complimentary cake.  When we arrived  we were told that there wasn't any window seats and that they closed in 15 minutes so we didn't have time to wait for one.  This had me highly upset because I specifically asked about this over the phone .  Whoever I made reservations with knew nothing about what they were talking about. I was going to leave but I decided to give the place a chance. I didn't get my window seat but I still had a very nice view from my table. We got  the charlotte nachos as the appetizer. It was tasty but could have been better if they would have put the toppings all over the nachos instead of one spot.  For the entree I got the grilled kurobuta  Pork shop and my husband got the Kobe beef short ribs.  My pork chop tasted burnt and almost made me throw up and the rice was nasty. I tried my husbands food and it was delicious . The beef short ribs melted in my mouth and the Lo mein was delicious.  I waited all the way up until we got the tab to see if they were going to bring my husbands cake out but they didn't. I had to remind them .  I'm giving this place two stars because they suck on customer service skills! I get better service at McDonald's.",

We arrive about 20 minutes before our reservation and we were invited to wait at the bar while our table was prepared. After about 10 minutes, we were in formed our table was ready. They sat us right next to the kitchen, which was kinda cool. After about 3-4 minutes, a young man (he didn't appear to be a waiter based on his black t-shirt he was wearing) came and filled up our water glasses and left. My wife and I sat there going over our menu options. During that time, no one came to welcome us or ask if we were ready or if we had any questions. About 10 minutes after we sat down, a waiter, Robert, came by and asked if anyone had checked on us. (I spent 17 years in the restaurant business and this usually means someone is not doing their job). We told him that we have only had our water glasses filled. He said \"well then I will be taking care of you tonight.\"  He took our order and the rest of the night went off without a hitch. The food was good, not great. I had the Kobe beef short ribs with lo mein. The lo mein was a bit mushy but the ribs were really good. My wife had the salmon and really had no complaints.   Overall, Farhenheit is a good restaurant if you have the money to spend. The rooftop view was amazing. I may go back again, but I may wait for another gift card promotion.",

It was the perfect meeting spot since it overlooked a city I have never been to. The bar had a great selection of local beers and I enjoyed said beer until the fire alarm went off.  Yes, there was a fire alarm going off while I was at a restaurant called Fahrenheit and no, this wasn't a theme.  We had to walk down about 24 flights of stairs with our drinks in our hands only to find out it was a False alarm. Great cardio workout but not a great way to enjoy a drink.   Was expecting a free drink on the house for the hassle, but not even so much as an apology. Oh well.  Best bet: Go here for a nice date night or a fancy dinner. Enjoy a drink before your meal outside. They have a nice set up that makes it feel comfortable indoors or out.",

Without a doubt the worst thing about the place is the staff- whether the unsmiling surly hostesses who unhelpfully stand around doing nothing or servers who take forever to take orders. Whereas the decor is trying to be sophisticated, it has more of a suburban housewife's idea of glamorous.  Hopefully better restaurants will open nearby.",

    "text": "Fahrenheit was not an overall bad experience. Maybe I had just heard too much built up about the place but by the end of the night I felt the place to be pretty overrated.  The hotel parking is easy to get to which was a plus. From then on the night went downhill. The hostess could not find our reservation which we made weeks in advance. Maybe a simple mix up.  Our waiter, while knowledgable about the menu items, seemed awkward and uncomfortable around our group. He spilled water twice while refilling glasses and accidentally dumped some leftovers of a plate onto my chair and leg. Not a big deal. Maybe he just had a bad night.  The music in the place was rather loud and made it difficult to talk. Even away from the noise of the bar in the center of the restaurant.  All in all the food turned out to be a weird mishmash of genres and styles of cuisine that didn't always successfully mesh. It seemed like the chef just threw together a lot of things that sound cool and appealing but just didn't work realistically together.  I ordered Pad Thai and it was your run of the mill Americanized Asian dish. Also tried the mushroom ravioli that was overbearingly earthy. Almost to the point of bitterness. The steamed buns with Kobe beef were good but the sweetness overpowered the beef. Again, just odd combinations of food with eye catching ingredients to make you think you're getting something special.   Here's the take-away: You're paying for the view. The food is overrated. Service a little spotty. I would go again if invited, but would not choose to go as my own idea.",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to dine at Fahrenheit for Queens Feast. I kept hearing about the views but heard food was so-so, but wanted to judge for myself. Once arriving we were seated away from the better views of the city so asked to be seated in area with better view which hostess accommodated with no issue. We decided to order off the pre fix menu, for 1st course my friend had the sticky wings which he noted were too small, and kind of dry. I went with the Fahrenheit greens which were pretty unspectacular for a house salad. It was barely dressed in the miso vinaigrette and it was mostly just lettuce with a tiny bit of  cashew. We both chose the Slow Braised Kobe beef short ribs which were so tender the meat fell apart into the broth and noodles and with the exception of being just a tad salty I thought were excellent.  For desert we both had the bread and butter cake, it could have been a tad moister and the peach compote was barely there. I did enjoy that it was not overly sweet though and enjoyed the nut topping.  On Service and decor I was not impressed... the waitress was average but not bad, but in the beginning there seemed to be a little confusion on who our actual wait person would be. Additionally, the  cheap looking wine card on the table as well as worn furnishings and placemats really took away from the experience. I know it's picky but if you are going to pay $45 (closer to $50-60 when it's not restaraunt week) for one meal I would really expect higher standards. Overall I would say the experience was average.. it would probably be better suited for a happy hour as you are really paying for a view. I believe that among others, places like  Del Friscos, Zebra, and even Vivace (which is more reasonably priced with in my opinion better food)  provide you with the type of food and service that I would expect from the prices and hype that are associated with Fahrenheit.",

    "text": "So was really excited to come here with my out of town guests and I hear great things. I made a reservation for 8 but we only had 6, so when we arrived I told them. They said ok let us reset the table. Nope instead they stuck in the corner in a booth too small and then added a chair on the end. So they took our table and gave to someone else.   First, it was literally 100degs in the corner they shoved us. We immediately asked why it was so hot and the waitress laughed and said yes it's the hottest table in the restaurant due to location. Instead of moving us to clearly a different table we had reserved, they let us sweat it out. It might sound extreme but it was so hot, half the table didn't order entrees because they were uncomfortable. Then with 6 people they added 20% gratuity which is ok if service is good but it showed they knew it was coming. She put the wine in a decanter but never poured it for us Until 20mins later when we asked why. The response was I thought you would do it yourself, the wine glasses are wide enough. Hmm pretty sure you are the waitress. The appetizers were all great but one. Dates, chips, steamed buns don't recommend the spring rolls. Goat salad was great but one of the members found the brown core of the salad in his. They came and apologized and did take it off the bill. Then manager came up had no idea who she was started talking and pointing at the pizzas and finally we figured out who she was when she mentioned the salad..kinda day unprofessional. I got the short rib, not worth $40 by any means. Was really fatty throughout where usually only a strip on the top. The pizzas were really good and can be shared with 2-3ppl.   Overall it was so uncomfortable that we had to keep going to the other side of the restaurant to cool off, their response was its an open air concept restaurant.. Um sorry to inform you but that would mean the windows opened...they don't. It's no different than any other restaurant. The air vent above us never blew any air and they could care less. The service needs to be better and quit talking down to people when you are the server. I don't see myself coming back even though the food was good. They need a serious attitude adjustment, I guess the customer is right doesn't apply here. It's unfortunate because the apps were really good and this place has amazing views.",

The week of, my friend had received multiple emails and phone calls confirming our reservation for that evening. We had thought because of this follow up service, we were to expect the same upon arrival.   We arrived on time and were notified they were running a little behind. They took our number and said they would provide a text when ready. We decided to go to bar and get a drink and stand outside to enjoy the sights and views. After about 30-45 mins we went to the hostess stand to inquire and the lady had mentioned \"oh yes, I do see your table is ready.\"  We were seated for a table of 6 right next to the kitchen door. Terrible planning. Some of my guests were constantly having chairs bumped into by staff. Knowing it was a busy night, we tried to be a little more understanding. The server took some time to come back to us for drink orders and food orders and at one point another waiter came over to help.   Beyond that, the food we all had was excellent and amazing in quality!! I had a bisque soup, Caesar salad, Braised short ribs, and butterscotch Brule dessert. All were delivered to table in perfect sequence and all plates were clean when waiter came by to clear table!  A pricey fixed menu due to occasion which we all understood.   Will return next time I am in Charlotte",

I had just drove 7 hours from DC and my friends who grew up in Charlotte wanted to make sure I saw the best parts. They had mixed reviews with Fahrenheit in the past but because of the view insisted we go. As we walked in the inside decor was lacking but when you step outside it is breathtaking. While one of my friends ordered drinks at the bar my friend was leaning over one of the railings to show me something and not even 5 seconds later he was being slammed on the ground and then against the wall by a bodyguard 3 times his size. They then kicked him out without letting any of us speak to him or them. I understand he shouldn't be leaning on the railings on top of a skyscraper but a simple \"sir can you get down\" would suffice. He wouldn't have argued or fought back but they didn't even give him a chance before physically and aggressively harming him. After, I went to find my friend at the bar to tell them what happened and he said the entire bar staff had been rude to him and we still hadn't been served drinks he ordered. I asked the bartender to cancel our order and she smirked and said too late and tossed them on the bar I took one sip and it was disgusting anyways and way over priced. It's sad I didn't even get to enjoy any food, drinks, or the atmosphere since we were only there for a tops 15 minutes. I understand why there was barely anyone in there for a Friday night since according to other reviews on here and Facebook they treat all their customers this way. Almost ruined my trip to Charlotte and put a bad taste in my mouth but luckily we went to the Ritz Carlton and they changed my view on this beautiful southern city. Stacey was the name of the bodyguard and he should be fired or at least taught some manners before physically assaulting someone.",

Showed up at 8:00pm Waited 30 mins past our reservation to be seated.  Sat in a table that was in the corner facing the city and apparently (according to the waitress) it is the hottest spot in the restaurant.  After sweating through my appetizer U ordered a starter salad to get enough sustenance to move on for the evening.  20% service charge on parties 4 or more...Service sucked!!!  They did put a shop vac fan near the restrooms to \"get the air moving.\"  Worst experience ever!  Where am I?    107 degrees Fahrenheit!  Also the manager and people walking around with ear pieces (creepy) don't care you are miserable...and the elevator was a sticky puke mess!",

We got Moscow miles and they were great (although they were $15 they had a good pour of liquor). I highly recommend this place (despite the Bitchy girl bartender).

Let me set the record straight they are not gross AT all, they are so... so good and if you ya e nothing when you visit you must have the dates from heaven. Unbelievable. Next was the Red Snapper with parsnip puree (the special) yet a surprisingly good, surprise in that the puree not the snapper. I love fish so I knew I would dig it but the parsnip puree was made this dish a meal just the balance in flavors with texture and technique. They placed the snapper on sliced finger potatoes making it easy to layer all the peers of the dish. Just Genius. On to dessert the Salted Carmel popcorn Sunday. Wwwwhhhhhaaaatttt? That's what I said popcorn Sunday, who comes up with this stuff, Chef David Feimester. Putting these flavors together is so insane that it literally gave me goosebumps when I placed the spoon in my mouth. The crunchy-salty-carmely taste with the smooth creamy vanilla in-house ice cream is something to write a wicked long review on Yelp about. The service was impeccable and attentive and you should and will expect as it is a bit pricey and don't mean pricey for what you get just pricey. The view, the food (OMG the food) and the service, you should expect to pay and I am happy to drop the cash and you will be as well.  Eat, Drink, Tell",

He wanted to surprise her with a special dinner and chose this restaurant. When his girlfriend placed her original order, the server came back and said they were sold out of that dish and she recommended a $125 item without letting this young couple know the price difference. He had no idea until the bill came. In my opinion, the server took advantage of a situation. Really sad. His girlfriend ended the dinner in tears feeling so horrible. Those you employ represent your brand and what this server says about you is that you are deceitful and sneaky. Not at all an establishment we want to support going forward.  UPDATE:: I reached out to the restaurant and they did make it right however they did let me know that they do not mention pricing because some people consider it offensive. I say, know your audience.

We went for just drinks on a second visit and sat outside. We sat on the outdoor patio furniture that sits on worn mulch. Mulch needs to be replaced & It's not elegant or attractive. I wonder why this was picked for an upscale restaurant with such a great view. And the pigeon poop needs to be cleaned off the ledge  periodically. Not to appealing if you tryna have apps.  Also over near the mulch or aka sitting area on the rooftop  lounge situation...we believe they are growing mint and rosemary, but most of it looks dead and like weeds. I was also confused by this situation.   I would say anybody is perhaps just going for the view. The rest of it is not worth your time.

Most recently for Mothers day we had a reservation for 6 and was seated soon after all of our party arrived. The set up was a little cluttered with us having to find different routes each time to get back to the table. The variety of food was top notch and worth the price.

You take an elevator all the way to the top, get to see a quick glimpse of the city overview, walk in to a cozy romantic environment, and get to see the few skyline of Charlotte when you walk to the outdoor patio. We visited during restaurant week to see if the food matched up to all that we had heard. I ordered the kung pao cauliflower, soy glazed salmon, and spiced rum cake. Everything was pretty subpar to be honest my favorite part of the whole meal was the rum cake which is kind of bad when all you want is the dessert.

The food was all quite good, except for the pepper-crusted ahi which had very little taste and relied heavily on the sauce to carry it. But the pork chop was delicious, and cooked perfectly, all the sides were great, and the Ahi Poke Nachos we're good, but very messy and hard to eat without toppings tumbling off everywhere. Drink selections were good, but pricey at $16 each. They had very few wines to choose from which was surprising. The biggest draw of course is the view, which is the beautiful Charlotte skyline.",

    "text": "I'm writing an updated review because it was that bad. I was so excited to go to this place again after having a superb experience a year ago. I don't live in NC, I live in Michigan, visiting my friend and made reservations two weeks earlier since I loved it a year ago.  I was sooo excited to go back, even looking at the menu days before and I'm not a foodie. I don't get excited about restaurants that often but it was so delicious there the last time, I was pumped.  We arrived 15 mins late and they cancelled the table and the hostess suggested we find a seat if we can find a seat. The place was empty and they had seats. I get they canceled the table because we were a little late but the hostess was straight up rude not to mention there were seats.  I'm in sales and it's all about customer service and how you speak to clients...this girl was rude. Our group of three find seats immediately. The waitress takes our drink order and I also order an app..the Charlotte nachos.  She delivers waters to our table 20 mins later and leaves. Comes back a few minutes later with our drinks and asks if we want her to put our app order in.  I'm not making this up, not kidding.  The nachos were dropped off 20 mins later...cold cheese dried on top. Again, not kidding!!!!  So we tell her the nachos are cold, takes them walks away and brings another nacho plate a little while longer.  The general manager stops by and asks if everything is ok. I proceed to let him know how great everything was a year ago and how I'm from out of town and I specifically chose this establishment because it was so amazing last time. This time was no gem, he offered to comp the nachos and dropped off 3 glasses of rose. The comped  nachos came not so good (picture chips with hardy ant toppings that cost $15 normally) but we didn't say anything.   The manager hung out with us for a while, even provided us his phone number to meet up with us later .  Not our cup of tea but hey? He was nice, comped some wine/ a sh#%y app trying to remedy the situation.   They even gave us a new waitress, she seemed nice at first till we got our bill, we ordered a bottle of  wine but she talked our friend into ordering the bottle instead of 3 glasses which would actually be cheaper according to the waitress.. Welp she didn't ask which wine, gave us the $80 bottle.  I am all about principle so I said something thinking the glasses are $12 so how does that equal $80. I told the hitting on us manager about it, he straight up threw a fit, telling us he comped us three expensive glasses and we should appreciate that. He grabs the bill walks away and brings it back (in a huff of course) and slams it back down on the table telling us he just rang us up for the cheaper bottle even though we ordered the $80 bottle. What ????!!! The f%##.  The nice waitress stops by to tell us sarcastically I hope you are enjoying you're time and picks up the bill with our credit cards to ring us up.  Yes another and wtf. What's with these bipolar restaurant staff??  Seriously??? This place is not cheap folks, I was so excited to come back..bottom line, just DO NOT EAT HERE.",

Then, to top it off,  I had to get the manager to expedite the process of paying our bill. Needless to say, I won't be going back unless they pick up the service game.",

    "text": "Go for the view, go for the view, go for the view...  I can honestly say I would give this place a higher review if the food was better. The menu is Asian inspired and but the execution is a little pretentious. The service was not as good as you would expect for the prices of the restaurant. Perhaps it was because I went with my family and this place is geared towards a more 'adult' crowd, but nevertheless the service should be the same no matter what.   The butter poach lobster tacos were nothing to write home about, neither was the duck fried rice. The papaya salad needed a little more kick to it, it is Asian after all... The best app that we got was the nachos, it's covered in local beer cheese and bacon. I would get them every time.   Though the lobster mac and cheese had a bit of lobster, the actual cheese portion of the plate overpowered the lobster a little too much. I was also really looking forward to the NY Strip... but it needed salt... a steak... that needs salt at a restaurant... without salt at the table... smh. The bright spot of the dish (figurative and literally) were the Brussel sprouts.   I go to Fahrenheit a lot for the view and drinks with friends, but I'm not sure I would shell out top dollar dinner here again. Overpriced drinks for the view I can handle, the food needs to catch up to the prime location of the establishment.",

We went for brunch and ordered the Crab Cakes, the Jumbo Cap'n Crunch Pancakes and the special, which was Shrimp and Grits, and was out of this world. As I said, the food was excellent. The service was good as well and the view, as you have gathered, is so pretty.  But the restaurant itself looks like it came out of a cheesy 1980's disco-themed hotel lobby bar. The ambience was weird and cheesy and just didn't match with the food we were served. It was so off-kilter with its gross black topped tables that never look clean and tons or black-lacquered everything. If this restaurant was simply decorated differently it would entirely change the perception of the food.  I gave four stars because our food was perfect and delicious, but I would not go back because the ambience is so dated and worn down and sad which is such a shame.",

Fahrenheit is located on the 16th floor of the Hyatt The area is pretty posh (do people even use that word nowadays??) looking with a large bar, dim lit area, comfy seating, and large windows to take in the view.   I have never eaten any food at this place and usually hit up Fahrenheit as a pre-dinner drink spot. This Saturday, we came as part of a Bachelorette party. The place was slammed and half was roped off due to a private event. If you are hoping to eat here, I would encourage a reservation.  We decided to grab a drink before heading outside on the terrace. I ordered the Khaleesi. Yes, 99% of the reason I ordered this drink was because it was called Khaleesi and she is a bad ass.  Anyways, this drink was very good and very strong. Great flavors and one was definitely enough! I thought the mixed drink prices were a bit high. Some creeping into the $15+ range.   We wandered outside and took in the amazing view of the city. There are tables and seats outside but the place was so busy that it was standing room only. We were definitely not the only bachelorette party who had the same idea of coming here! There were fire pits set up and running and it was nice just to stand against the railing and look out upon the city. Excellent first stop of our evening!",

The staff congregates around the pillar at the center of the bar and are so busy chatting that at least 3 times we had to wave someone down that wasn't around the pillar just to get them to get the bartenders attention.  The Vietnamese Rolls were crispy with a good amount of spiced meat and the sweet/lightly spicy dipping sauce.  The Pork Belly Steamed buns were simple and good.  They had the Dr. Loosen Reisling for $35/bottle.    The prices are high for what you are getting, especially when the service is so lackadaisical.    The outside area is nice to walk around and see the city and the mountains in the background, but the sofa seating outside isn't facing the view, but rather into the glass doors. If they're open it might be nice otherwise you're just staring into smoked glass.  There are some fireglass pits out there, but again, no seating around them.  Ladies keep those legs together if you're sitting down out there.",

    "text": "As a native from Cleveland I was so excited to find out Fahrenheit was coming to Charlotte. For of you that don't know, the owner also has as location in Cleveland. The menus are slightly the same, but they have a select few different options. I loved the Cleveland location when I went there, but the Charlotte spot has been a miss for me.   -The location: Nothing can beat the view! The restaurant is located on one of the top floors of the Hyatt hotel and the view is AMAZING! They don't have much outdoor seating which is a bummer- it's more of a hang out spot. But this is a must for out of towners. You see the entire Charlotte skyline,  -The drinks: The cocktails are awesome and unique! However, they are a little pricey with the average drink price around $12. The wine selection is Ok. Nothing to rave about for being a nice restaurant.  -The atmosphere: It's modern, but elegant. A bit fancier than most places so make sure you comb your hair when you come here.  -The food: This is the biggest miss for me. The food was just average. Nothing to really rave about. I got the salmon once, which was served with wasabi mashed potatoes. Holy crap- whoever thought of that idea needs to go back to the drawing board. My brother is a head chef and thought that sounded disgusting too. My husband got the filet and it was good- but again, nothing to rave about. It was a little tough. On the bright side- the calamari was pretty good, but nothing to come back for.  -The service: Service has been hit or miss. The first time we came here our service was horrible! When we sat at the bar the bartenders have been great though.  Overall, I would come here for special occasions or to take out of town guest- mainly for the view. I recommend to sit at the bar and get a drink & app, but not stay for dinner. I think there are better places to eat in Charlotte for the money. OR just travel to the Cleveland location :-) Since I loved the Cleveland location I'll give this a 3 stars....",

While the local favorite Charlotte Nachos was a hit, the entrees were average quality. One steak was sent back and it's replacement comp'ed on the final check due to no flavor. The charges were not made correctly resulting in calls to the card company to correct.   One member (who had the twice served steak) exclaimed they do not plan to return to the establishment.",

Have a drink, go outside and enjoy. But if it's fine dining you're after, you will not get it here. I think our waiter literally had no idea what he was supposed to do. He fumbled through the entire meal; he had no personality, and he didn't really seem to care. It's like we were imposing on his time the entire night. At the end, he brought us the dessert menu, left, and came back with the check. WTF? He didn't even ask us if we wanted anything.   My wife and I had fish and my daughter ordered the pizza. The fish was terrible; it smelled bad, the flavors didn't blend at all, and midway through the meal we were both eating my daughters pizza.   I know you won't believe me. So go ahead and try this place, enjoy the view, but get the pizza; it's the only safe bet. Or, save the $50 per person bill, and go to Pikes 5 times. They'll appreciate your business and treat you better.",

Didn't even ask us what we would like to drink or whether we wanted appetizers but instead just went straight to the main course. Whenever we wanted to substitute anything, she pointed out that it was way too \"expensive for us\". Overall, the food sucks and they aren't welcoming to black folks.

    "text": "Nothing like restaurant week to give you an opportunity to try a fancy, expensive restaurant on the cheap. That's what the wife and I did along with another couple. I had looked at the menu and read the reviews good and bad, but we had to try it out for ourselves. The wife and I were running a little late, so our friends had a chance to get a drink and check out the outside patio and they reported enjoying both with the exception of the $12 for a Jim Beam on the rocks.  I think that there may be other parking options, but we chose to valet at the building itself, which was $7. That's the reduced price from $10 since we were eating at the restaurant. The elevator ride to the 21st floor was a quick and we finally made it to our table, which gave us a view into the kitchen and expediting area. The decor itself was nice but nothing really special. I didn't really get a sense of the bar area but it seemed popular. Once we ventured outside, after our meal, we got the sense of why Fahrenheit is special and it's definitely the views of Uptown from the outside patio deck.   On to the food, they offered the full menu along with the $30 restaurant week menu, but everyone at the table opted for the 3 course offer. As appetizers, we covered 3 options at the table, mix green salad, sausage and biscuit, and the chicken spring rolls. All 3 offered offered great portion sizes, even the sausage and biscuit was almost entree size. Everyone was pleased at the table flavor wise. For entrees again, we covered 3 choices, king salmon, scallops and pork tenderloin. The chosen temperatures for the salmon and the pork were well executed and all plates came with good portions of accompanying side vegetables. The cauliflower was a great combo with the scallops as was the sweet potato and pork and again with the salmon and wasabi mashed potato. Everyone enjoyed all the flavors and agreed that the plates were very well balanced. Everyone further agreed that we look forward to a return visit. The only dessert option was a peach cake with vanilla ice cream which was a nice way to end the meal. As mentioned before, we did go hang out on the patio and see the view of the uptown skyline.  The main knock on the evening for me was the service which in my opinion was a little chaotic and clumsy at times. They were busy due to restaurant week, but I would expect a little better considering the quality of the food and price point. We got off easy due to the $30 menu, but Fahrenheit is definitely a special occasion place based on price. They do have bar bites I believe and some pizzas to share that could help you experience the food in a cheaper manner. We may just do that next time we visit.",

    "text": "Welcome to another \"Hype of Charlotte!\" Here is the \"chronicle\" of the night:  It's my good friend's birthday coming up and he wanted to get dinner here. I went online, made a reservation for 8:15pm last night. I also browsed their menu online, thus I know this is a pretty pricey joint. The funny thing to me is that their seafood entrees are better priced than their meat entrees ($20s vs $30-40s). I don't have problem with the price for as long as the food and service are up to par.  I guess the night was doomed before it even began. I called ahead trying to make sure I know where to park. No answer. Well, I know my way around uptown fairly well, so I figured it should be pretty easy to spot the parking garage. So this forever-been-abandoned-building-formerly-known-as-The-Park does NOT have a public garage that I could see. I drove around that block of Caldwell @ 3rd/4th Street 2.5 times and it's simply baffling how to get in there. I ended up parking on the street at the meter (which is free after 6pm during the week). AND the main entrance to the building faces in away from the main street (Caldwell) next to a gravel parking lot. It's the most bizarre setup just to get into the place.  Once I walked through the sliding door to the building (which is also partly a hotel), I saw 2 valets sitting on their behinds. Well, I guess that may have explained the parking fiasco... they probably should have been outside by the door so at least we had a valet option. It wasn't even cold. Then we got \"ordered\" to use the elevator on the right by the door lady because the elevators weren't clearly marked.  22 floors upward later, we walked into Fahrenheit. Looking into the bar area, I could see the appeal. There were big windows/doors opened up to the balcony area, the breeze was coming in to the bar. The lights of the beautiful city skyline in front of it. BUT it's nothing a nice hotel in a bigger city where it's typical to have a roof top bar couldn't offer. So this is the 1st establishment in Charlotte that offers it... it just details how behind Charlotte can be (as much as I love my adopted hometown).  Hostess apparently was in crisis mode with another patron who placed a to-go order. From the sound of it, this lady placed an order over an hour ago, and the food still wasn't ready. She must be staying at the hotel, because she said she was tired and she just wanted food and if it's not already cooked, she's fine not eating at this point. YIKE! Not a good sign... shouldn't a situation like this be handled professionally AWAY from the front door by a manager????   We got seated promptly, to the left of the entrance, in a side dining area. We walked by several big tables (6+ top). We ended up at a  2-top table in between two big parties. I felt very squeezed in. And by gosh, there was no air circulation. For those who know me personally, you know I am NOT a high maintenance person. But no one should feel uncomfortable in any restauarant, let alone a high end establishment. And NO ONE greeted us. There was no water. Nothing, nada.  By now my friend and I just looked at each other and contemplating leaving. The waiter who was busy handling one of the big tables next to us finally turned to us and acknowledged the fact that we were there. At this point we decided to move ourselves to the bar area. I stopped by the hostess station to inform her of our move. She smiled and said that's ok.   Well, call me crazy, but shouldn't that be a hint that something went wrong? In that case, shouldn't a manager be informed that guests just moved themselves to the bar for unknown reasons? And thus shouldn't a manager stop by to at least inquire and pretend it mattered?? Instead we got a visit from a waitress. She asked if we didn't get any service, which we said yes. She then said she was afraid that was the case because she saw us and she was about to come over to take care of us. I don't know if it was a case of concern, or a case of table section turf war.  The bartender was... present. That's the best description I could muster. He was there, but he wasn't friendly or attentive. He got us our drinks, took our food order and efficient.   Food... finally we got to the food. At this point we didn't know if ordering food was a good idea. We talked about going to another place for dinner. But we ended up order the lobster sandwiches ($13) and spring rolls ($9). Food arrived in RECORD TIME. I meant, we ordered, food came. It felt more like the food was already done and we just happened to order it. Food was ok at best. There were 2-3 small pieces of lobster meat on each of the 3 sliders. The minced chicken in the spring rolls were a little dry.   4 drinks (3 Jim Beam & Coke = $28.50 and 1 Chenin Blanc $8) and 2 small plates set me back $73. It was the worst $73 I spent.   Words of advise: just because it's new, has pretty view, has a chef's name attached to it does NOT make it a great restaurant automatically.They have much works to do.",

Great design, Open floor plan plus additional inside seating.    Parking - a hassle  Service - small bar can't accommodate patrons, resulting in extreme waits for service.  (10 minutes per drink - 20 minutes to close tab)  Best view in the house is on the patio.  And I refuse to sit at a bar and eat a $45 steak.    Drink Prices- ludicrous - Grey Goose Cosmo $19.  Ciroc rocks - $16.    Food - Great tasting, tiny portions.     This place will definitely have a CTJ meeting and revamp their entire philosophy, or it'll be dead in 6-months, or they'll shut down and reopen under than name Celsius.",

Picked a kimchi fried rice, and of course it came out with sausage pieces in it. Being vegetarian they initially thought they may have been mushrooms but then after a few bites asked a non veg to try it and lo and behold, it was pork sausage. When we told the waiter he was embarrassed as if he forgot to tell the kitchen staff in the first place, and then a manager came over the apologize and sneeringly offered some sort of percent discount off of our meal without even trying to listen to our concerns, kinda rude.",

Our waitress didn't give us an itemized receipt and put the entire bill for 7 people on the card that we had to put down to hold a table (just a drink table, not full food table) without asking if we wanted it split.  I asked for an itemized receipt and she gave us a nasty look! When she brought it, we saw a 20% tip was included and she didn't even mention it. She was absolutely trying to sneak that by us. We asked to split it 6 ways and she was again rude and said the machine couldn't do it, which was probably a lie. She shouldn't have assumed the entire tab was together from the go. She also intentionally upcharged us for one of the beverages, but we didn't even argue over a few bucks based on our experience thus far. Be careful for sneaky people if you go! Otherwise, the drinks weren't worth the money. For a good view, go, but for good drinks, choose somewhere else.",

I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for my girlfriend and I and anticipated an amazing meal with a view. Once we got there, we were seated behind a wall and were unable to see anything. We were also placed under an air vent that kept us freezing cold the whole night. We also had to yell across the table to each other just so we could hear.  Food-We ordered the Crunchy Shrimp Tempura for an appetizer and while it was good, it was at the table in 2 minutes. Our main entrees were also at our table less than 5 minutes after we ordered our food. I feel like these entrees are pre-made and then plated when you order. For the price, I expect a made to order meal. The portions were very small and once we received them, we knew we would be hungry afterward. I had the Ahi which was good, but I've had much better for less with sides I could actually enjoy. My girlfriend ordered the scallops which consisted of 3 scallops with a piece of cauliflower in between. Again, the food was good but we have had much better for less. The one portion of the meal that we were satisfied with was our dessert which was the blueberry lemon cheesecake. It was the best part of our meal which was reasonably priced. The view on the outside patio afterward is amazing over the city but I will not be back for a meal. The bar and patio is the ideal place for drinks though. The food was good but should have been much better for the price.",

In summary it felt like a hotel restaurant(ironic the building  is now a hotel) without the constancy  of good food. Oh did I mention it will cost you double what it should? Should be a 1 star, but the views are nice so I'm going with a 2.  Service - Sat for 3-5 minutes with many servers walking past us with no acknowledgement. Finally our server shows up to take our drink order. Don't see him for another five minutes and then returns with no drinks. Starts to explain the appetizers, but fumbles up what ingredients or items are available multiple times. Put in the recommend appetizer that was suggested. It came out amazingly fast, but wait where are my drinks? Oh there they are.. after 15 minutes of sitting. Keep repeating this with every course - slow, doesn't know the menu, etc. I didn't even get to order a second round.  Food - Appetizer was okay, but nothing special considering it was $22. Girlfriend and I are huge steak fans so she went with the Sirlon with Au jus. I went with the more expensive bone in aged steak. Her steak was cooked as requested(medium rare.) My steak was a mix of well done and uncooked? The outside was some what charred while the center was purple. Both tasted bland and just did not impress either of us. The mashed potatoes were good.. actually they were the best part of the entire experience!   Save yourself a large sum of money and just do drinks to see the view. Go eat at all the better restaurants in uptown 4 times with the money you will save on a meal here.     I still feel ripped off - diners remorse? That's a first for me.",

Well, I should have read the Yelp reviews before going, then I would have more realistic expectations.  I started with the tempura clams.  They were very good, but they were served with a dressing that tasted right out of the bottle from the grocery store.  My friend got an avocado appetizer which was less than impressive.  The second course we both got the Kobe beef ribs served over lo mein & bok choy.  We were both wondering why on earth if you are going to get one of the best cuts of beef on this planet WHY why why would you drench it in sauce ? Furthermore, the cut of beef was greasy and fatty and it was a short rib WITHOUT the bone.  We agreed the fat should have rendered off and it was not cooked properly for that to happen. Additionally, there was literally a pool of lo mein sauce at the bottom of the bowl.  For dessert we both got the dulce de leche cheesecake with blueberry compote.  It was a rich, dense round 3\" disk if you like that, but personally I like a lighter cheesecake [cheesecake factory's dulce de leche cheesecake is MUCH better and larger portion].  Sorry, but I make better blueberry compote and I'm not a chef. My friend got a glass of wine ($11.50) and I got a hot tea ($3.50).  The tea was amazing... lavender earl grey.  The waitress was very pleasant and prompt. Valet Parking was $7.  Bottom line, go for the view, drinks, and an appetizer but don't waste your money on the food.",

When we called to explain our situation we basically got \"sorry we can't help you we are booked\" from the hostess. (this proved to be a clear lie)  Called back and spoke to a nice manager who got us \"in.\"  Here is the rub, when we dined there last night the restaurant was far from full..making me think that yes, they are planning a little \"we are super busy game.\"   Once we arrived the \"scene\" was hopping! Lots of well dressed pretty people packed the bar. The service at the bar is SLOW- we never got a drink in 15 min.  If you are looking for a place to make you feel like you are in a bigger city or  \"hip\" I'd say this might be your spot. The views are amazing! The outdoor space is very cool. I've never seen so many people Facebooking and Instagramming photos of themselves on a roof in my life.   On to the food- DISAPPOINTED. It's not that the food was not good it's mainly that it is very over priced.  We had the roasted cauliflower and the kale salad- both good. It was the main dishes that really disappointed. I had the bone in steak at $45, it was tough and fatty. My husband had the fish special which was just very ok.   Our server was very nice, but the service was not well coordinated for a restaurant at this price point. Our main course was delivered while we were still eating our appetizers and the person delivering our food did not seem to know what do to. I literally had to take my appetizer plate and set it in the window to allow space for my steak.   I'm a restaurant bathroom coinsure, and the bathrooms NEEDS ATTENTION. Like maybe even an attendant. Broken soap dispensers, toilet paper on the floor etc.    Bottom line- great place for a drink (if you can get one) the views are amazing and the bar area is nice. Also, probably a good spot for dessert and an after dinner drink, but skip the main course.",

    "text": "I have worked in the Food Service Industry for almost ten years and I understand that this is a new restaurant. However, it does not excuse a lot of simple service steps that were missed during my visit with other Industry Professionals.   We had a group of 20 people and we were seated promptly at the time of our reservation and our drink orders were taken and served in a timely manner. We put our appetizer orders in at about 8:30PM and they were placed on our table at 9:53PM. The bread and butter came out just minutes before our appetizers. The wait for those appetizers was beyond ridiculous, the fact that our beverages were not refilled during our wait made it worse. The biggest issue we had was that no one, including server and manager came to us as a table and communicated anything about the long wait of those appetizers. Any kind of communication would have been nice. A simple \"We are sorry for your wait, but our kitchen is pretty backed up right now\" would have sufficed.  The nachos and spring rolls ordered were cold and before the appetizers were finished the entrees were being served to the table. My date and I only chose to stay for the appetizers and when we asked for our check, it came after twenty minutes. We waited another fifteen minutes until the server came back to pick up our credit cards. Then, it took her at least ten more minutes to process the payments and return with the final check copies to be signed.  It is my understanding that Fahrenheit is a fine-dining establishment based off the decor, location and ticket price. The expectation is to have customer service and food to match the establishment. I truly believe that the appetizers were rang in the same time as the entrees. The General Manager who was \"walking the perimeter\" was inattentive to his restaurant's guests and not once helped his staff to provide even better service.  The food is nothing to write home about and I was under-whelmed with my entire experience. In summary, I will not be coming back until there is new management and after a few years of experience.",

    "text": "Lazy waiters can ruin a great view...the food was mediocre, definitely not worth the price. We split the kobe beef ribs app and the burger.  The beef ribs were great but the burger wasnt worth the 15$ it cost. The waiter refilled our drinks 1 time the 1.5 hours we were there and only after we asked. Being friendly is normally a go to for waiters but not here. Go to Blue or Capital Grill instead.",

The views are phenomenal, the food was fantastic.  Specifically the tomato basil soup, goat cheese salad, and lobster mac!  The staff was also very gracious and friendly.  I can't wait to go back and try the small plates!  This place will be a hit!",

    "text": "We had heard mixed reviews and decided to experience it for ourselves during restaurant week.  Upon arriving, we were told that they lost our reservation and we would have to wait.  But to the hostesses credit, she didn't make us wait long and apologized several times...forgiven!  While we were at the bar waiting, we did get to take in the great views of the city.   Once seated at our table, we quickly realized that we had to speak quite loudly in order to hear each other, and we could hear the surrounding conversations very well (as if we were at their tables).  We ordered the calamari and a vegetable plate for our first course.  The veggies were tasty and the calamari was average at best.  Shortly after our 1st course came out, our 2nd course arrived.  To the waiters credit, he asked if we would like to wait until we were finished with our first course...we did...he forgot to bring it back out later and we had to re-order.  We ordered the Hanger Steak & the Salmon.  Both were good but not great.  The best part of my hanger steak was the potato & horseradish puree.  The salted caramel cheesecake was very good (and I rarely eat sweets).   The bottom line is that we were glad that we decided to try this place during restaurant week because the $30 is the most the meal was worth.  We will probably come back and have drinks on the patio to enjoy the view.  If I would have paid full price, this would have been a 1 star review.",

    "text": "I read and heard numerous things about this restaurant before giving it a shot finally. New restaurants are bound to have service issues. Everyone is just trying their best. So I decided to give this place a shot on Saturday. We squeezed in a 6:30 reservation and were all so excited to give this place a shot. The parking is a bit tricky and the building faces into the city (not the street) so even finding the building can prove a bit tricky. They have valet which is usually your best bet although I don't know if it is complementary or not. When we got in the building luckily we just followed someone to the right elevator. It is the far elevator and you go to the 21st floor. As soon as you step out the view is lovely. The bar is sunken into the floor and when the weather is warm they open all the doors and the guests spill onto the exterior patio. It's equipped with fire pits and comfy couches for the masses and I imagine during the warmer months this place will be packed. For an appetizer we had the calamari salad. So good. It had a little spice to it and the salad it comes with is delicious!   Wine list was reasonably priced for the selection. For entrees I had the lobster Mac and cheese which I thought was a little over priced for what you get but all portions are of good sizes and I found service to be on par with other fine dining restaurants in the area. Kevin was knowledgable and friendly and enhanced the experience. I would like to give this bar a try again and maybe sit outside on the patio!",

    "text": "Having recently located to Charlotte from Los Angeles, I'm going through restaurant withdrawal. Not that there aren't good joints here, of course, but compared with LA's crazily inventive and always-dynamic scene, Charlotte's been a bit of an adjustment. That's why I'm glad that Fahrenheit's on the scene. It's out there taking some chances - bringing some Asian elements here, dashing in some Southern style cooking there, but pulling it off with some well-executed flair that hitherto hadn't quite made it to the Queen City. Service is pretty solid for a restaurant of its newness and size and, frankly,  it's leaps and bounds over most other places I've been during my five months here in town. Food standouts here include the inventive cocktail list (very few joints here in town are similarly daring); the ramen (I mean, it's probably the only place to get that outside of Musashi, and the view at Fahrenheit is better than the Ballantyne strip mall that place occupies); the sashimi appetizer; the pork tenderloin; the all-day braised bacon and grits; and the short ribs. I give it a solid four stars and an additional fifth for the potential that I see.  Oh, and one other thing - step up your game, Charlotte. This is a nice new place with a great view. Don't show up in your cargo jorts and flip-flops. Have some pride.",

Cheap fluorescent lighting that is seizure inducing. Service is uncaring and intermittent.  Menu's are like something out of Showmars. No water options besides tap. Nothing to munch on (bread, etc) is provided. Pizza was burnt and too much Rosemary. Calamari was disgusting. Slight glimmer of hope on the short rib buns. Scallops destroyed by the cream of wet dog and sand like bits. Oh, and it's impossibly loud, so good luck understanding your server or trying to have a conversation.",

Use of Butter is never a substitute for real culinary skills. Atmosphere: Great view but interior design and poor lighting distract. Needed to spend some money on quality furniture, design, and lighting. Crowd: Wants to be seen at the latest spot and could care less about the food. Chef: Who cares. Should spend more time in the kitchen and less walking around the dining floor. Staff: Not polished. Needs more experience. Overall spent $140 + on two glasses of wine, one appetizer, and two entrees. Won't be doing it again!",

    "text": "I wanted to like it...I really did.  Sadly our experience was mediocre at best.   I'll start with the pros: -Friendly and attentive staff -Beautiful patio and views of uptown -Yellowtail sashimi appetizer and crab legs entree were tasty  And now, the not so good.  We'll start from the beginning.  Parking is nonexistent.  From what we could tell, the only option was to valet, which was not complimentary (as most valets are for restaurants uptown).  When you choose a location for a restaurant that does not have parking, and literally the only option is to valet, that service needs to be complimentary.  We made reservations for 4:45pm (we have a small baby and needed to be back for bedtime).  We were basically the first people seated for the evening, yet they put us at a sad little table against the wall instead of one of the awesome tables with a view by the windows...tables which remained unseated for the majority of our visit.  They then crammed a loud group of probably 12+ people right beside us, despite the rest of the restaurant being relatively empty.  The food was just ok.  Nothing really bad about it...but not amazing.  Certainly not worth the $200 check.  The valet had instructed us to hand our valet ticket to our waiter for validation...so we're thinking maybe guests of the restaurant don't have to pay the $10 valet fee.  Wrong...the validation provides a $3 discount.  Really?  Why even bother?  And the grand finale...when we stood up to leave, I realized my knee had been resting in a rather unpleasant pile of GUM on the bottom of the table!  I mean this restaurant has been open for a week tops.  I haven't even gotten gum on my pants at a 20 year old McDonald's, let alone a brand new \"high end\" establishment.  So basically, I spent $200 to eat bland food and ruin my pants.  They did offer to pay for my dry cleaning bill, which was very nice.  It's not their fault some low class moron put gum under the table...but I do think if I were an experienced high end restauranteur that would be something I instructed servers to quickly check for before opening every night.    Again every staff member we came into contact with was very friendly, I have no complaints in that department.  But overall, this restaurant just seems like an overpriced Applebees with a  pretty view.",

I ordered the Salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes (which were to die for, and I don't even like wasabi) and pickled cucumbers, and even though I took this meal to go in a little to-go carton, this was one of the best meals I've ever had in my entire life. Every single piece of the meal had it's own unique flavor, and I didn't want to stop eating even though I was completely stuffed full. I 100% recommend this restaurant to ANYONE!! View is also incredible if you're eating at the restaurant - even at the bar it's beautiful!  I never write reviews but this one was totally worth it... AMAZING!!!!",

The restaurant was freezing!  We were by the thermostat (59 degrees) and it never climbed beyond  60 degrees the whole time we were there. Also, we made reservations and our table was across from the kitchen door and by the service station.  I asked for another table but was told the others had been reserved.  What?  So we ordered drinks hoping to warm up!  The service staff was very friendly if a little hurried so the drinks were fine.  Food was ok but nothing special.  A very expensive experience and disappointing since our daughter and her friend were visiting for the holidays.  We should have dined somewhere else.   On the positive side, we would go back and have a drink in warmer weather and enjoy the city view.  If you are looking for great food, this is not the place.  There are much better restaurants in Charlotte.",

This turned my wife off from even wanting to purchase a bottle of nice wine for our celebration. When we got there the host were polite and seated us promptly. Our server seemed as if she didn't want to be there, she wasn't very interactive at all. Rarely smiled. Didn't really suggest anything, food or beverage wise. It was our first time there. So when the food came out, the presentation was phenomenal. But the food wasn't that great, we both maybe took 3 bites a piece. Maybe we just made a bad choice in what we ordered which is perfectly fine. So we had to flag our waitress down for another beverage. She never asked how everything was, she just asked if we wanted a Togo box which we both declined and she could see that our meals were barley touched but yet and still she doesn't ask if everything was okay. Overall other than the view of the city we both had a horrible experience. If we ever return it would just be for drinks and the view.",

Once seated, Kala, our server was so personable, knowledgable and brought a passion to her explanation of the menu. I had friends visiting and she brought out hush puppies for us to \"guess\" what they were. While writing this it may sound corny but it was a nice touch to our dining experience and impressed my guests. My only downgrade was the wine list which did not offer a lot of choices in my opinion. I ordered the King Salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes, blood orange saikyo miso and pickled cucumbers and carrots. The dish was just what I was looking for, filled with flavor and cooked perfectly.  My guesses had the North Carolina Pad Thai and Ahi Tuna entrees and were impressed as well.

    "text": "The afternoon started off good. We grabbed a table in the bar area and enjoyed the view and nice 70 degree weather. Ordered some drinks and 2 appetizers. Drinks came, a beer and a cocktail. I had the 2nd Ward and it was yummy. Then we received the appetizers, which were yummy as well. Had the Charlotte Nachos and Sweet Potato Biscuits. The nachos were actually spiraled potato chips with cheese and scallions on top. They were good and so were the Biscuits.   Now is where the issues started. The service was great up until this point. There were plenty of people walking around and asking if we needed anything. Then when we wanted to order our last drinks, we could not find anyone to ask for another drink. About 10 mins went by and we were finally able to catch another server and ask her for drinks. She promptly brought them to us and we asked for the bill at that time. We gave her the card and she brought it back and that is when we noticed that we were only charged for one round of drinks, instead of the 2 we had. I brought it to the server's attention, as Karma is a Biotch and I don't need anything like that, so she took the bill and went to add the drinks we had. She brings the check back and it is still wrong because she didn't put the right drinks on there. By that time, we were just ready to leave so we just paid and left.   The bar area seems to have a lot of confusion and I think it would be great if a specific server was dedicated to certain tables and not let it be a free-for-all with numerous people asking how things are going.   Also, I think this place is WAY Over-priced. For 2 liquor drinks, 2 beers, and 2 apps, the total bill was over $80.   The view is beautiful, but not worth the price you pay. I'm glad I was there only for drinks and apps and not dinner as I would have been even more upset with some of the prices I saw on their entrees.",

Checked in with the hostess who said to return at 7:30 and our table would be ready. We returned to her at 7:30 at their table was not ready until 8 PM. We were crowded at a table originally set for 4 with one of us (myself, the host) seated at the end of the table in the middle protruding into the aisle where I was constantly jostled by waitstaff for the entire evening. It would be of interest to note here that a local VIP and his party of 4 was seated at a table set for 6 approximately 5 minutes after us.  First comment...this is the noisiest restaurant in which I have ever dined. Conversation at our table was impossible without shouting and even then strained and difficult. Sitting at the end of the table, somewhat isolated, I finally gave up.   We ordered appetizers which were served almost immediately, while we still had our menus, which essentially covered the tabletop, leaving no room for the food and were given no plates for sharing the appetizers. One of the appetizers was billed as \"bacon and grits\". It was a 1x1x3\" piece of barely cooked pig fat swimming in watery grits...inedible and disgusting.   We were never served bread until we asked for it, after noticing several other tables with bread and despite there being bread plates in place for each of us. Suffice it to say it was not served with a \"happy heart\" by the wait staff.  After ordering our entrees, we waited nearly an hour for them to be served. When we asked about them, they were brought out within 1 minute...tepid, not close to warm.  I ordered scallops and noted there were 4 on my plate. My wife ordered the same and only received 3. They were tasty...nothing special...especially lukewarm.  When we were almost done with our meal, and sensing we were dissatisfied, the manager brought out 2 side dishes gratis. TWO OF OUR PLATES HAD ALREADY BEEN CLEARED FROM THE TABLE!! Seriously?  The manager forgave a large part of our check, but that will never make up for the loss of what my wife and I intended to be a very special evening for our son during a rather difficult time in his life on that one night when we wanted him to have a wonderful evening and enjoy a little break from his stresses.   We will never return.",

This place was amazing!!!!!  The ambiance was great - it was warm and inviting but definitely not \"stuffy\" at all!    This restaurant is on the rooftop, so the view is incredible.  It was cold outside but they had a fire going outside, so that was nice.    The food and service was amazing.  We had the following:  Chicken Spring Rolls Maine Lobster Tacos Crispy Tempura Rock Shrimp Crispy Calamari Raw Oysters Margherita Pizza  Everything was delicious!!!!  My hubby's favorite was the Lobster Tacos and my favorite was the Rock Shrimp.    At the end of the night, after we received our bill, our server brought us a dessert with \"Happy 17th Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate.  A very nice (and delicious) surprise!  Definitely looking forward to returning the next time we are in Charlotte!!!",

The server never at least acknowledge our day, which is probably because she was never told.   The drinks were outrageous in price, and the food was average at best. My wife's halibut was dry, but had decent intentions with regard to ingredients. My filet was so small for the price, but was a tasty little guy. I did not see any chefs or sous working, which for the price point I expected a expert hand governing food quality.  Our server was nice, but never remarked us with new silverware between courses, and our main course came out before we finished with our first course. The staff all seemed a bit stressed or a bit gloomy in spirits.   The noise level is off the charts, and should be addressed soon, or it will kill their long term success. I would not come back for dinner, but I would come back for the view and possible appetizers and drinks at bar.",

    "text": "Yes, best view in town and there are tasty dishes on the menu but after having been there several times, my my recent visit was a collosal let down. I took a good friend for her birthday (chef) and after raving to her about it, I was embarrassed by my choice. Diners should expect quality good, drink and service at any price but $18 appetizers and $30-$50 entrees, I don't expect to have to send back three cocktails, one (completely tasteless) appetizer, and to ask for the manager, Adam Quigley to come to the table( only to have to track him down myself). I shared my concerns w Adam and basically tried to dismiss my comlaints by telling me that other customers enjoyed their meals-- as if that had anything to do my experience....???  I don't know how he long has been there but if his interaction w me is any indication of his brand of management, Farenheit should do better.  I also thought it was odd that after noting that our reservation was for a birthday ( I told reservation the hostess, waitress and manager), no one acknowledged it until after we paid the bill and our waitress heard us lamenting the bad experience. We were done w our meal, dinner and dessert and she had someone bring a Sunday to the table. All in all, when you're looking for fine dining, it's not just about food. It's about the entire.exprience and our entire party was very disappointed. It wasn't worth the nearly $400 bill",

    "text": "Fahrenheit is all about the city view.  If there is a tourist trap bar in Charlotte, I think this would be it.  Atmosphere - Hot (on this evening, literally), fire...fire...intense evening sun, noisy, nicely set up (except why are there bright lights on outside in the balcony area during the night that take away from the beautiful view of the city?), crowded, fancy/ trendy wanna-be peps, and Thursday evening business travelers laying waste to their expense accounts.  Service - Accommodating, helpful, pretentious air...but expected to make the place feel special.  Food - To me, it is fancy-sounding appetizers and pricey drinks that mainly makes up Fahrenheit.  The place does offer a full dinner menu, but I was here for apps and drinks on this night.  My table ordered a few items: Spring Rolls, Mr. Fungi Roasted Mushroom Pizza, and Chorizo Stuffed & Bacon Wrapped Dates.  While the wrapped dates sounded delicious, I did not have an opportunity to try them, as they went quickly.  I did get to sample the pizza and spring rolls, which were ok but nothing that made me go \"wow.\"   The apps were standard fancy bar fare of super thin pizza and indistinguishable spring rolls.  I should have grabbed a date when I had the chance.  Overall - Fahrenheit does have a very nice view of the city.  I am not sure where else in the CLT you could get such a nice view.  For that you should come here for at least one drink.  While the \"look at me\" crowd, pricey drinks, and so-so apps were what I expected as soon as I heard we were going here; the blazing evening sun overtaking the cool a/c was something I didn't expect.  Though by its name, I should have at least anticipated it.",

When she overheard us talking about the difference between fresh and store-bought eggs, she gave us the number to the local source for eggs that the restaurant uses. She also took our pictures outside against the skyline when we asked her.  The food was expensive, but I thought it was delicious. For a rooftop restaurant, I would think expensive prices are to be expected. The view was amazing and I can see myself going back again sometime.

Why would they even have seats there? The Main dining area looked her up and inviting. But we were seated near the bar, it was loud and service took a while to get around to us. We were thinking, we wish we would've booked at our usual place the capital Grille. Nonetheless we wanted to make the best of it, hoping the food would really wow us. Unfortunately Service remained very mediocre/slow and the food was just so-so. If you're going to be spending $50 a plate per meal the entire experience should play into that and the food should be great. I think if you want to go for the views and have a drink that would be perfect. I can see how the outdoor atmosphere is really the draw. But if you want to have a very nice meal and nice dining experience, go to the capital Grille or somewhere similar. Fahrenheit  is high priced restaurant without all of the extras.",

    "text": "Pros: A really great view.   And that's it.  We went as a group of 5 adults for appetizers and drinks. 5pm on a Sunday night, with the place only 25% full inside.   One of our party ordered one of the specialty martinis, which was recommended by our server. When the order was placed, the server returned to our table to report the bartender said they were out of one of the ingredients. So another recommendation for a different martini was made, and that was ordered as the replacement. A minute later and she's back to report that the bartender is out of one of the ingredients of the second martini ordered. I think ultimately a glass of wine was what this person had.   The appetizers are sub-par by the standards of a church social potluck. Their total mediocrity wasn't helped by the fact they required a ridiculous amount of time to appear from the time they were ordered--remember, we are one of only two or three active tables inside the bar area at this time.   I am pretty sure our server was high. I don't mean this as a joke--she had no attention span, no sense of urgency, and a complete inability to follow an order through to completion. I had to leave the table after waiting 20 minutes to find someone who could provide me with a Diet Coke that had been ordered. No apology, no sense of duty to serve the table.   If you absolutely must go for the view, my suggestion is to limit your drink requirements to bottled beer. The price is lower than the mixed drinks, and because the bar staff apparently doesn't think it is important to keep the key ingredients on hand for an evening of serving drinks, there is low probability you'll get served your first request for a mixed drink--or even your second. Stick to the beer, which they are less likely to screw up.   If for any reason you think I am being a dick about this, I do invite you to read the other reviews and see how often this restaurant and bar are called out for (A) slow, poor service, and (B) mediocre food. If I owned this dump and saw the negative reviews piling up as they are here, I would close for a week, fire everyone, and start over. Judging from the number of months the same complaints have been made, I don't think ownership is concerned about the guest experience, since they will continue to receive a steady stream of new customers because of the view--the one thing Fahrenheit hasn't screwed up.   Yet.",

    "text": "The View - Like other yelpers mentioned its the view of the city that's undeniably the best part of this restaurant.  Located at the 21st floor it sure does give you quite a nice view of those tall buildings with lights glowing at night.  Lots of outdoor seating space available and obviously the best tables are gone first.  Us, a party of 4 got a table at the end and our view is an empty parking lot LOL.   Drinks - Our drinks were mules (Furiosa's Homecoming), Jewel Runner (served in that colored ceramic tiki mug) and couple ginger wheat beers.  All drinks were nice and strong enough.   Food - We ordered Margherita pizzas, Wood grilled avocado and jerk style chicken wings.  Pizzas were good, nothing special.  Did not expect anything special anyway.  So no complaints on that.  Dough was fresh and the curst was good.  Wood grilled avocado was good too, basically two halves of avocado with some grill marks on them topped with some sauce and crostini on the side.  Avocado was fresh and its such a simple and tasty appetizer.  Wings was good too, again it wasn't unique but good.  Nothing much to complain about it or to praise. Cost - Expensive!  Yes, honestly its a bit expensive for the food they serve.  Not sure if the view is the only reason for the high price because with those items we tried nothing felt special or out of ordinary.  Oh yea, parking is $10 but valet.   Ambience was definitely great, our waitress was very attentive and checked on us frequently, great time with friends and a great view.  Normally I would give less than 4 stars when some things bother me, but I am still going with 4 stars for Fahrenheit for the view ( I will update my review when and if get bored of that, LOL)",

Food-had several dinners there, and have never walked away impressed. They even managed to make pizza \"sort of, kind of\" blah, or coat decent scallops with sause reminiscent of \"less than\" Hellmann's mayonnaise...   Drinks-honestly, has anybody ever had a cocktail there, that did not taste like a window cleaner? Regardless the menu description, they all come out tasting Windex like. I was there with a decent group of friends, and we literally had one of each cocktail on the menus at our table-all equally shitty. Promptly switched to wine.   Service-here comes my \"favorite\" part of Fahrenheit! One thing the place stays consistent at-crappy service. Seriously, I take quests from out of town there all the time (damn you, the view!) and I have even started telling people to looooooower their expectations)))))   My recent experience has actually prompted my to finally write this review.

Would recommend any of the following for food-   *Short ribs- if I didn't order tuna I would get this, it is delicious  *Bacon covered dates- always order for appetizer and would highly recommend  *Calamari  *Nachos- the \"chips\" are actually medallion sliced potatoes  The wine list by glass is smaller but has some decent options. They were out of the Napa Valley cab we wanted but the manager recommended some alternatives.   We usually go here for work dinners but I've been here on the weekends for a drink.

    "text": "I had read about this place in a magazine but it didn't live up to the review.    We arrived early & were seated right away.  We were on the opposite side of the kitchen & back a bit so while we could see the view, it wasn't great having to stare across other tables to look out.  The room was cold (turned out they sat us right under a vent) and it was so loud we couldn't hear the server nor could we talk.    The meal was very quick.  No bread or time to enjoy the first round of drinks.  I had the lump crab pasta & my husband the tuna.  All I can assume is there was a big pot of pasta sitting in the kitchen that they dish from, because the meal came way to fast to have been cooked to order.    The food was okay.  Portions were smallish.  We ordered dessert also,and left knowing we would be looking for a snack later in the evening.  Dessert was okay - they ran out of sherbet so my husband got vanilla ice cream.  I had the cobbler, which was less than stellar; it was a biscuit in the middle of a bowl of pie filling.  I think we were in and out of the dining room in less than an hour.  At this price point I expected a more leisurely, relaxed, custom prepared meal.    The one positive I can say about Fahrenheit is the view from the patio.  We went out to the deck after eating for  a post-meal glass of wine.  The view of the city & the sunset were lovely.  It is windy, so if you get chilly easily (like I do) bring a sweater or wrap.    In the future we may return just to have a glass of wine on the patio, but will not be returning for meals.",

I would take folks unfamiliar with charlotte here so that they could see the skyline...in the growing space of rooftop venues/restaurants, this was a good view with decent food. My two star review is from the poor service that I received while was there last. I was seated at a table near the windows. The waitress required me to let her hold my card before I could order dinner. Surely this had to be because I was near the bar.... But.... I had never had this request on previous visits so I thought it was odd. I then asked others in my area if they had to provide a credit card in advance of ordering.... Every single person said that they didn't. I'm extremely disappointed in the service. I asked my waitress (Hannah) why I had to leave a card and she said it was policy. When I advised her that everyone else in the section was outside of the policy she just had a dumb look on her face and assured me that my card was safe.... Well Hannah that wasn't the issue. I gave two stars for the view alone. I guess Hannah was afraid that I'd parachute off the building or run to the elevator right in front of the restaurant  and wait five minutes for it to escape paying for my meal. Guess who didn't get anymore refills after I confronted Hannah? Too many other rooftops around for this nonsense.",

They tried putting the 3 of us in a back room with no view but finally seated us inside with partial view thru the huge group. The food was mediocre and overpriced as well as the drinks.

We chose the Queen's Ramen and a pizza. Both were absolutely delicious so we decided to come back for more food a few days later. When we arrived, we were told our wait would be about 5 minutes however, it took about 15-20 minutes. The executive chef, Dave Feimster, was there upon our arrival and noticed we had been waiting longer than expected. He immediately grabbed us some drinks as well as a tempura shrimp appetizer once we were seated for the delay! 15-20 minutes isn't even that long of a wait however, the fact that he went above and beyond to make up for it really surprised me! And it was very much appreciated! We ended up ordering the Queen's Ramen again (it's that good!) as well as their special of Pork Steamed Buns and the Slow Braised American Wagyu Shirt Ribs. The food is truly amazing and this place has the most amazing view of the city skyline. Great atmosphere, great food and phenomenal service from the Chef! He truly cares about his restaurant and his guests! We'll definitely be back when we return to Charlotte!",

    "text": "This could have been my go to celebration spot. I wanted to like it so much I went twice, and neither experience was good.  The first time I went we made reservations, and we went about an hour early and checked in and grabbed a couple cocktails. At this point we told the hostess that we were happy to eat earlier if a table opened up. We enjoyed our cocktails on the patio and took some pictures of the wonderful city view. We went back a couple minutes before our reservation time to check the wait - and were met with \"uhhh a few more minutes.\" We sat front and center for another 20 minutes at which point we found and complained to a manager. To his credit he sent out a snack, and managed to get us a table with a view within 10 minutes of our complaint. We ordered the lobster rolls (just okay) and the manager sent a complimentary order of bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates (amazing). My halibut was just okay, boyfriends lobster Mac and cheese was amazing.   We figured maybe they were working out the details the first time we went, we tried again for restaurant week. The spicy cocktail my boyfriend got was so spicy it was unpleasant to drink. We were seated 15 minutes after our reservation time. The menu we were provided was not what was advertised online. When I asked the waitress if they would honor the menu posted on restaurant week's website, she snootily informed me that the menu she gave us was the only option (let me mention here the menu was the same except online it showed a choice of app, choice of salad and entree. In the restaurant you could only choose app or salad, entree and single dessert option, so it shouldn't have been hard to accommodate the request to have an app and salad instead of dessert). When she brought our wine she didn't let us sample it first, and had a huge attitude about refilling the glasses.   We had the spring rolls and goat cheese salad (neither was impressive), he had the pork and I had the salmon. Both were good, but not amazing. Neither of us even finished our dessert, it wasn't great.  Two stars since some of the food is amazing, but not all. Restaurant is not efficiently run, but a if you get a manager they will try to improve your experience. Overall I didn't think it was worth the money.",

Perfect location for dinner on a clear fall evening, we enjoyed a few cocktails on the patio before we were seated in a neatly-situated cozy booth in the corner, but next to the window. Our waitress was phenomenal and was helpful since most of our party consisted of first-timers. It took me a while to realize how much water we were all drinking, because our server always made sure we had plenty on the table.  I ordered the special which was prime rib with root vegetables. Now this was an impressive piece of meat when it came out, but it was not anything special. The coffee glaze gave it good flavor and made it unique. The vegetables were also so-so.   Our waitress recommended the banana cheesecake for dessert, which I couldn't turn down (being a lover of anything banana-flavored). It was delicious and came with a little bit of banana ice cream, but the portion was unimpressive. One person in our party ordered the chocolate mousse (or something of sorts) which was also delicious but came in a much bigger portion, which was shareable.   Fahrenheit receives 4-stars because it has the BEST view of the Uptown Charlotte skyline, a great atmosphere, and fantastic service. I just wish their food could seal the deal. This is a Charlotte staple and I expect to bring my friends here next time they're in town for a cocktail and a view.",

We were asked if we had reservations to which we replied no and then were told there would be an hour and half wait. Now I get it we go out enough to know how this works but there was ALOT of tables open and only me and husband it's not like we had a large party. We did get a spot at the bar ordered our food there and ate. It was very busy but all bartenders were friendly food was worth it. I got scallops my husband the pork chop.

    "text": "This gem of a place has great views and great food options. I tried the Springer Mountain Farms Fried Chicken Steamed buns. I wish I had taken a pic but I devoured it pretty quickly. Great as an appetizer and enough to share. It was a difficult choice to make dinner wise but I went with the Margherita pizza. Also very delicious! Definitely don't order just for yourself bcs it's a huge pizza (lesson learned). I ended up taking half my pizza back with me to the hotel. But it is enough to share with 2-3 other people. Get there early and I suggest making reservations. You'll not only beat crowds of people coming in but you'll have a better selection on where you would like to sit. If there was one \"complaint\" to make it would be that once it starts to fill up inside it tends to get pretty noisy and a little difficult to have conversation at your own table. But that could also be because there's no where for the sounds to be absorbed considering you have glass all around you. However, do go and Enjoy!!",

When we arrived parking was limited because a vehicle stalled directly in front of the garage entrance so we had to find street side parking. This was a fluke so no dings to the restaurant for this.  Once we parked we walked to the entrance or what was labeled as such and the door was locked. Remember this building also houses condos. This was off putting because we had to wait to be let in by people exiting.  Once we arrived to the restaurant we were quickly greeted and seated. When I booked our reservation I asked for a window seat but this was not where we were placed. Nevertheless we had a nice view.    The waitress and staff were EXCELLENT! and attentive. Definitely 5 stars. The decor and setup of the restaurant/bar are 5 stars.  The food unfortunately was Mehhh. I am not sure why the food is raved about here but I was not impressed. It is a solid 3 but nothing more. The appetizer we ordered (lamb-cumin meatballs) were DRY!! NO MOISTURE.  My entree was cooked right (Ginger soy Salmon) but was oversauced which is my pet peeve. My husbands Snapper was dry and tough. Finally, we took a chance and ordered dessert. I mean it was our Anniversary dinner after all but that was disappointing as well. We ordered the carmelized banana bread pudding and received bananas that were not caramelized. I posted the pictures of the bananas. Additionally, the bananas had a strange aftertaste which led us to believe it was mingling with a vegetable or another fruit.  Ok here's the verdict!!!  Will I return ??? YEP FOR DRINKS ONLY  Is it worth a visit??  ABSOLUTELY  The 3 stars is for the food only. The experience overall was good.",

We ordered a bunch of appetizers but my favorite was the chorizo stuffed dates.   I also like the tempura rock shrimp. It wasn't particularly sweet, more like creamy. We ordered the North Carolina Cajun shrimp which came in about 8 pieces of shrimp and some toast- more on the savory side. The North Carolina nachos were a bit too greasy for me.",

    "text": "This restaurant has been on our radar for nearly a year and a half. With two gift cards to spend we were cautiously optimistic, and after reading Yelp reviews we were less optimistic. On arrival for our reservation, we were told to wait in the lobby because they were out of menus (WHAT?) so we obliged. After ten minutes and seeing several parties be seated, we were ready to leave so we approached the desk and they didn't even know we were waiting. We were seated at a nice window seat and were grateful to watch the sunset.  We decided to order a bottle of wine, La Crema Chardonnay was $45, and is a bottle I regularly drink at home. We were told that we could pick anothr bottle off of the list or that there were some wines not on the list that we could have.  We were then presented with a few options and we chose one of them. When the waitress came back she informed us that we could have a different [other] bottle that was less oaky and creamy than the wine we ordered, available now, or they could go downstairs into the wine cellar to retrieve the one we ordered [the 2nd bottle]. We opted for one that was not on the list because I am really into oaky chards and she told us this Chard from Chile was not very oaky. After another 10 or so minutes, we were told the one we ordered was not in the cellar but they found the La Crema after all if we still wanted that. We did not get our bottle of wine until about 6:45 and our reservation was for 6pm. This was ridiculous.  The food was good but not worth the cost. We only ordered small plates, but we ordered several of them: ahi tuna nachos, queen city ramen, wagyu beef steam buns, and rock shrimp tempura. The tuna nachos were tasty but the tuna was sparse. The queen city ramen was my favorite item we ordered. The wagyu beef was hard to eat because of placement on the bun; it was tasty, but the beef was dry. The rock shrimp were not something I enjoyed; I took one bite and felt like they were butterfly shrimp thrown in a spicy mayo sauce.  All-in-all, I was disappointed with the experience and would not recommend dining here. Drinks on the rooftop and a quick app are one thing, but I won't be back to dine for dinner.",

I went for my birthday and ordered the Charlotte \"Nachos\" which were towering. They weren't much to talk about on their own, but I ordered an extra side of the pimento cheese fondue that they were dressed in and that elevated them significantly. My cousin's ahi tuna nachos were much better. I also ordered the meatballs and wished I hadn't. They were bland. Someone at my table ordered the short rib. They were served on a bed of lo mein and drenched in an Asian inspired sauce ... I tasted it and thought it was ok, but had a bit of a weird, sweet aftertaste. She was not pleased with the dish at all. I also tried the Peach Better Have My Money dessert. It was good, but not overly impressive. The service was was excellent, the environment was excellent, and the bathrooms were clean. That's pretty much the that on that.",

If you're looking for a good place to bring a date, do a girls night out or just take some really cool pics...this is the spot!  I enjoyed the food too. I ordered a Tangerine Dream to start it's refreshing but packs a punch! I loved the spiced rum and fresh citrus mixed. For an app, I ordered the crispy tempura rock shrimp. Very well done! It's the honey glaze sauce that makes this dish. I'd absolutely order it again.For dinner, I ordered the pepperoni pizza. It's definitely more than enough to share between two people. I enjoyed this as well, the toppings to pizza crust ratio was just right and I really loved the pepperonis.   So, why just three stars? The service here was a huge let down.   I'm just going to say what we all know...average or crappy service can ruin the whole experience. That's what happened here. I do not think it's too much to ask for people to be attentive and knowledgeable during your visit.   This place has the potential be be great - they just have to step it up when it comes to the customer service.",

Two things:  -I didn't know the restaurant was in a Hyatt Place Hotel (my bad. poor research) -Secondly, mothers day was a buffet. (again, my bad, should have researched more thoroughly)   The room was a mix of a day care/geriatric/ ill mannered \"humans\"....It was buffet style so, a lot of sharp elbows while attempting to plate a shrimp.   I've never been to a Golden Corral, but my guess is Fahrenheit offers up a similar vibe & food but, Golden Corral is probably much less than $170 US Dollars, for two.  So yes to the view. No, we won't be back",

We went for birthday and had a reservation at 4 PM. Half of the party (including myself) arrived at 4:05 and the rest ran late and didn't arrive until 4:25. I asked the hostess if this was ok and she said \"that's fine but just so you know we have a 2 hour limit for tables, so just make sure you're finished by 6:15\".... I have NEVER been told that my table had a \"time limit\" on it. That's absurd. We all joked about this during the entire dinner. Our waiter was just as rude as the hostess. He wouldn't accommodate my friend who is a vegan by taking the cheese off her pizza, and i asked him about splitting checks and he basically said he was too lazy to do it. Unreal. Additionally,  the other waitresses laughed and turned their noses up at my friend who was slightly underdressed for the occasion. I've never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant in my life. I probably will not go back after this experience. But, i will say that the food delicious and came out quickly.",

I gave it  ***** STARS, the Hostess were quite friendly and delightful, walked us to our window seating  in front of the fireplace that we could see out the balcony overlooking our beautiful \"Queen City\".  We started out with some appetizers that was recommended to us, wine....it was great except the Ahi Tuna was a little bland to our taste, but the bacon wrap was good.  Then not too long, they brought us our bone in ribeye, which was just too fast to come out because we didn't even get to enjoy and finished our appetizer, we were rushed.  Our Ribeye was cooked perfect to our liking, one of the best we've had as far as Ribeye goes.  Our dessert, we chose milkshake with whip cream...like we need it, also they surprised us with an ice cream and butter milk biscuit...quite tastey.  Overall, I'd say WE LIKED IT A LOT AND WE SHALL RETURN.  The Staff were fabulous....special thanks to our Hostess, \"Kala\".",

Your cocktail waitress, Camille, very pretty young lady was beyond patient with my indecisiveness of what I wanted to drink. She was knowledgeable of the cocktails, helped me to ultimately choose the Easy Plateau and Oh My Gosh, it was beyond delicious. I think her touch from bringing it from the bartender made it even more special because of her great customer service. Then to have the beautiful view of Charlotte, it made me feel like I was in some movie. Anyways.... Due to Camille, she bolstered Fahrenheit reputation with me. She portrayed the right image that every company wants their employees to show! I will continue coming here because of her and will recommend my co-workers to come, as well. I would happily pay for a reward or recognition for Camille, that's the kind of impression she left on me as a first time customer.",

First, they brag that all tables have a view,except the one we were at. Then they had no beverages small children might like. I realize that they do not generally cater to kids, but considering the occasion they should have made plans.  The food choices, individually, tasted great,but you would expect that they would continue to replenish the seving stations rather than have three straggly pieces of waffle,etc The fruit looked great, but shouldn't a chef know not to serve kiwi that was not ripe? Lastly, the service was sluggish and dirty plates just stayed on the table. Considering that there was no real serving going on, other than drinks, what was the staff doing?",

It was quite expensive to say the least, particularly for lunch. It was 80 bucks for 2 entrees (one of which was a salad with salmon), 1 coffee and 1 mimosa.

The drinks are a bit pricey but fair due to the location. (Just moved back down South from NYC) so this is common.  We have been back 4 times since then. I feel that the food varies between a 3-4.5 star depending on what you get.  But then last week happened.                                                               I had my sister and her husband visiting so we decided to take them over to Fahrenheit. Everything went placid as usual. Both the wife and sister had the seared tuna. And both got sick over night. It could not be the alcohol since they both had two glasses of winE throughout the whole night uptown. I called to let them know in a professional manner about what had happened & what could be done about it. The manager completely discarded my call by giving me the chefs credentials and that there is no way they have ever had any complaints since they opened? So basically they are impeccable and the customer is always wrong. Could not care less. She said that the GM would call me later in the afternoon but never happened. Now I firmly understand that this establishment sees people as quantity rather than with courtesy.",

We were all happy with what we ordered. Overall, we thought it was a good brunch, but I'm not sure how often we would return because it seemed like the wait staff/front of the house just didn't quite have it together. For example, we had requested outdoor seating when making the reservation, but they tried to seat us inside. I could see why, the outdoor seating options were surprisingly limited and in one area even seemed a little yucky with weird pigeons floating around and a gravel pit instead of a patio. Then it took forever to get a Bloody Mary and we were finished with our meals by the time it came. I would say to give it a shot for brunch, mostly because it was good food. Hopefully the wait staff was just having an off day.",

Not much choice. Nice move on their part. Oh did I mention it took 30 minutes. Food was good but took forever. Ordered espresso but couldn't drink it. It tasted like some sort of chemical . When we left, we expected some sort of apology, it never happened. Would go back for drinks and the view but not for dinner. Too bad.",

    "text": "Hmmm...how to put this delicately.  Wanted to love it, but just didn't.  Second time dining here and both times underwhelmed.   Yes, the view is one of the best in the city, but dammit, how hard is it to prepare a limited menu? There are eight signature entries, 10 small plates/appetizers, limited pizza and salads.  That's it, which is fine, after all, I do like a small menu as long as it delivers on flavor and originality.  Started with the grilled avocado with goat cheese crostini and tempura rock shrimp. I order a lot of food.  I like to dabble and taste many things.  These two items were standard fare and prepared correctly. They tasted good but no artistry here.  That's ok, consistent food is a good thing, right?  For my main, I had the filet mignon (medium), with smashed grilled potatoes, tomatoes, smoked corn and creme fresh. Oh, what a disappointment.  Filet was tough, I actually had to use my steak knife on it to cut it.  Not used to that.  The potatoes were sliced (not smashed) and grilled with no seasonings, oil or flavoring other than a dusting of parmesan cheese.  In other words, flavorless. I mean, it's a potato and there are so many great things to do with it to make it taste great. The corn was good as were the tomatoes. No complaints. The creme fresh was just sour cream. Again, no original flavor.  Had the filet been melt-in-my-mouth perhaps the sides wouldn't have disappointed me so much, but as it stands, I wasn't pleased. A $45 filet should taste great.  My previous meal was a private function and all I remember was feeling...Eh...the foods OK.  Certainly, not worth the price. I suppose I am paying for the view.  Just come prepared knowing that and you won't be as disappointed.",

Staff members there greeted us in/ out when we left. The food was more than filling, loved all the dishes thus far. We will certainly be returning soon and would recommend this facility.

We probably spent about two hours there. The waiters were friendly and attentive. It happened to be my birthday and our waiter brought me a mini cake- such a nice surprise!

The Pizza's are Large enough for 2-3people: Mr. Fungi Pizza....First of all, I LOVE all white pizza!! Not a fan of Red Sauce. The Mr.Fungi is topped with roasted Mushrooms, garlic, caramelized onions and goat cheese.....freaking amazing...gotta try it!!!  Margherita Pizza is unlike any other! Fresh Basil, tomatoes, and Mozzarella   Grilled Creekstone Farms Burger comes with BACON (excuse my excitement) Grand Cru Gruyere, tomato Jam... which is more of a puree, arugula on a House brioche....#foodporn.  **Update**  Visited for brunch with a few friends.

    "text": "I'm writing this review on our second visit to Fahrenheit, and I will say that from our first visit in 2014 to our second visit in 2017, I was not any more impressed. I gave this restaurant 3 stars, and 2 of them are for the  view.    We came here primarily for the city view, which is undeniably gorgeous. If you get the privilege of seeing the sunset up on the 21st floor, you'll really enjoy it. However, that's where the impressiveness of Fahrenheit stops.   My biggest complaint is that this restaurant is strikingly overpriced. We came to celebrate a few family occasions with family from out of town, and we knew that it was expensive but opted for some cheaper options and shared pizza. The pizza easily feeds two people and the flavors were great (I recommend Mr. Fungi), but at $23 a pie, it's so not worth it. We also got jerk chicken wings, which were beautifully seasoned, but again, $14 for 6 wings? No thanks. I can say the same for the desserts (Fahrenheit candy bar is delightful), but still too much. The only menu item I did not enjoy was my mojito. Granted, the manager did ask me if it was to my liking, and I told him it was fine, but it was really the most average mojito and I would never get one there again.   My husband and I were frustrated that 3 years ago, the valet parking was free, and now they add $10 to your bill. We would have no problem with this if the menu wasn't already beyond overpriced.   So I gave this place only 3 stars because, while the food is nicely prepared, I could get nicely prepared food elsewhere for half the cost. And the drinks were not good enough to just come back for drinks and the view. We probably won't visit again--we just did not feel it was worth it.   TLDR: Good-but-not-amazing food, but overpriced and not worth it. Don't get a mojito.",

It took a hot minute to get anyone's attention at the bar to order a drink and water, made us somewhat leery of what was to come, there was lots of standing around chitchatting. The red headed bar tender was the only one I saw hustling and seemed personable. However, our waitress Cassidy made up of the somewhat lousy bar service. She was awesome and very personable! The lobster Mac and cheese was by far my favorite; my husband tried one of their pizzas and it was delicious!

While many stayed for dinner we had a few drinks.  It wasn't crowded which was nice.  The weather was nice; thunderstorms in the area so pictures outside overlooking the skyline of the City was very limited.   The bartender was excellent. Knew the bar menu very well and knew what to suggest his customers. The garden of E  If you are hungry for a snack most go for the mountain high pile of nachos chips.  It's potato chips freshly fried with all the fixings of nachos sprinkled on top.  It was definitely the most popular appetizer on the menu.    I will be back here again for both dinner and drinks.

We got tempura shrimp, fried Brussels and a margarita pizza. The tempura shrimp was the best thing for sure, I would not get the pizza if I could do it over - not much flavor.  The drinks were really good! I got a bourbon mule cocktail, but my biggest knock of all would be the water! We were offered still, sparkling or mineral and asked for still, figuring that meant tap water, and were charged $6 for a not great bottle of water?? Everyone around us seemed to be getting tap (aka free) water so it was very odd our waitress offered us 3 types of must pay for (apparently) water.   Honestly if they're trying to be bougie enough of a place to try to charge for all water options, they need to majorly up their food and service game.",

We were going to see Queen at the Spectrum Center across the street, and the storms were moving in, so Casey, our waiter, provided balanced and zippy service to make sure we could get there when doors opened. We split a good wedge salad, they divided it for us, how nice! My husband had the ahi tuna entree, which he enjoyed very much. I had the lobster mac'n' cheese. This dish can be ruined by coagulation of cheeses, but this one was well balanced, flavors delicious and plenty of delightful, fluffy lobster, no chewy or mushy meat. Also the olive oil infused focaccia was excellent. The view was terrific. Excellent meal, kudos to management, chef and Casey!",

As an out-of-downer, I have to say this is a great place to go for a drink and the view - especially considering it's the rooftop of a hotel. We had a pretty large group, so we all ordered at the bar inside then ventured outside. The drink options are great and the views are amazing! I had a glass of Sauvignon blanc, but my friend had the Shop Local and it was fantastic. I typically do not order coffee cocktails, but I wish I did order this one.  We did not order dinner, but we took a look at the wine list and they had excellent options! Some of our favorites that are typically hard to find (ie: great variety of Orin swift wines).  My only con is the lack of seating outside. They have a great outdoor fire pit that really is just for show. They should utilize the space better and put some couches around it.  Definitely a must try for a quick drink on the rooftop!",

I've been various times and my opinion remains the same. However, I would say our waitress on this latest visit was not as friendly and we felt rushed. Overall, she didn't talk much to us. It was like she asked one question and brought the order back. At that point, she asked were we ready to close our tab and we were confused because we were literally just served the dessert. It may have just not been her best day because that was the first time I received such service. Other than that, beautiful view of the city and a few first come, first serve seating in the area (reservations accepted for other areas).",

Coming around the time of sunset made for amazing group photos. The food was incredibly good. We got a variety of things from the small plate options because there were so many things we wanted to try. As a table we shared the Charlotte Nachos and they definitely should not have been considered a small plate option because they were stacked up in a huge mound. But we definitely weren't complaining because they were tasty, we just did not expect the significant amount of machines that we got. We had the lump crab rangoon spring rolls which were delicious. They were fried really well and had a good balance of crab and cream cheese that was very flavorful. The charred broccolini was really refreshing and served on top of a tasty pimento aioli sauce. My absolute favorite thing was probably the short rib steamed buns. I love bao buns and the short rib was juicey and tender. And they marinated it very well because the meat was full of wonderful flavor. We also got the tempura rock shrimp which was pretty good as well but was probably last on our list in terms of favorites. I didn't expect Fahrenheit to have such a wide variety on their menu and I loved the amount of options I had. If you're look for a night out with a great view and good food I definitely recommend coming here.",

We made a reservation online, super easy, around sunset time and we were happy we did! The views from the rooftop patio were breathtaking! You can leave your table to walk the patio, just ask your server.   The food for Queen's Feast Week was tasty and a good sized portion for the price. My friend and I split the tempura shrimp and kung pao cauliflower first course, I got the glazed salmon-she the fillet, and we split the two dessert options-smores cake and spiced rum cake. The decision to split was perfect and I didn't have to make a decision about what exactly to pick!  Pro tip: To get here from the street, you walk to Caldwell side of the building and there is a door that takes you to the elevator to go up. Look for the \"F\" signs on the building to help.",

    "text": "I've been to Fahrenheit multiple times to have a drink on the patio - the view is spectacular, no one can argue that.   We went in on Saturday for dinner with a party of 7. We had reservations, thankfully, because it was swamped with prom. When we arrived we were told it would be a little bit a of a wait, I always find this frustrating with reservations - but it really wasn't too bad. We grabbed a drink at the bar and were seated shortly after.   Our waiter, Arlen, introduced himself and brought waters. Five minutes after we were seated the hostess brought menus...that's right, we didn't have menus. She apologized for not realizing the mistake - okay no problem.   We were interested in ordering some appetizers so we asked our waiter about the \"spring rolls\" and how many come to an order. He told us 5 and recommended two orders - perfect. Appetizers arrive and there are 3 per order, so now we've spent $28 on an appetizer that won't even give one per person. I looked at him and said \"Is this one order or two?\" He said two...and I reminded him that he told us there were five per order. His response was \"Oh, the spring rolls is only three and went on to list other appetizers that have five.\" He then asked if we wanted to put in another $14 plate of 3 spring rolls. NO. He didn't apologize for the mistake on HIS part, he didn't offer to bring out another order or help in any way. I told him we would not be ordering another.   The entrees were mediocre, small and not worth the price. The whole time we were waiting on water refills etc. which was frustrating. When grabbing plates a dirty butter knife was dropped in my lap and once again, no apology or anything...he waited for me to hand it to him. Our bills were all mixed up upon arrival, even though the split was very clear cut. Everything was slow, we waited 20 minutes for the bills.   Go for the views. Skip the meals and the service. I would not have dinner here again.",

Quite expensive I think for Charlotte. Maybe not for New York.",

    "text": "For this review I want to preface that I went for Restaurant Week.  I was pretty excited to go to Fahrenheit for RW. I've heard mixed reviews, but know the view is awesome. I figured the restaurant week menu would be a perfect time to try it out and not spend $$$$.  The view really is amazing. It's situated off the main path so you get to see the cute little downtown that Charlotte is. They have fires across the rooftop so even though it was cold outside I felt great being out there.  I ordered the cauliflower as an appetizer (SO GOOD) and my boyfriend ordered the shrimp, which he also loved.  We both ordered the filet and both of them were a bit undercooked so that was a bummer.  For dessert we had the s'mores bar and the rum cake. Both were great, but the rum cake was spectacular.  We would go back if we had friends in town - that view. (Also the cauliflower!)",

I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews but the food was excellent and the service was pretty great. Our only complaint was that the experience was a little underwhelming for the price we paid (this is super nitpicky though). They neglected certain things I'd expect from a high-end restaurant such as boxing your food for you, but that's honestly not a big deal at all. I can just see someone a little more posh getting annoyed. The view is awesome but those tables are first come first serve.  Overall, I'll definitely be going back.",

    "text": "There is no doubt that Fahrenheit has an excellent view. While there are other places around that also have a reasonable panorama, most often they are looking directly at other buildings. Here, you get to see other buildings to be sure, but they are not so close you can reach out and touch them (this may come, but for now, you have a bit of space).  Also, there is a bit of room to wander - including a firepit and even some greenery. All in all a nice outdoor space, perfect for the spring, if it decides to come and stay for a while.  The staff is very friendly without being intrusive, and the food is the sort that sounds excellent as well, though some of it just makes you say \"hmm\", in an Arsenio Hall sort of way. I can't count the number of times I saw giant platters of chips coming out and wonder if there is someone in back with a drill in back like they have at the fair. Surely not, but stranger things happen.  On the downside, parking is a bit of a challenge. There isn't any nearby, so your best bet is to use the valet. It's only $10, but they can be a bit pokey to retrieve your car, and you need to figure it in the cost of your meal, where many other places include a complimentary valet.",

    "text": "So this is a tough review... I hate giving mediocre ratings, but I'm going to do my best to explain why I feel that this restaurant only deserves three stars.  Point blank, the only reason it got three is because of the view.  My disclaimer is that we did eat here during restaurant week.  I asked one of our waiters if he was overwhelmed because of how many people were there and he said no, that they had about 400 people on the books tonight (Wednesday) but that on the weekends it's closer to 600.  He said, \"if I'm not crying I'm doing okay\" -- haha... (insert terrified face here).  PROS: * The view cannot be matched.  Seriously, you should go there just to get drinks and watch the sunset.  Absolutely breathtaking - and they even have their own garden on the terrace! * Our waitress was very sweet, not the most attentive person, but still very nice. * The mixed drinks looked great!  CONS: * We made reservations for 9pm, showed up 30 minutes early to get a drink and take in the view and we still didn't get seated until 9:25pm. * As a follow up to the previous bullet they tried to put us at a table literally next to the back kitchen door that was in front of a drink station so we couldn't see outside (WHAT) - so I asked if we could move over at least one table so we were not in the kitchen.  They obliged... but what made me mad is that there were other tables open by the windows!  If you are a restaurant known for your view you should seat people as close to the window as possible at all times!  Common sense here. * The food - listen, I know it's restaurant week and you are very busy... but you only give people three options - so you should be able to whip up those three options with   accuracy, grace and beauty fairly quickly.  The food was downright not good.  I got the fried goat cheese appetizer (which is an enormous plate of baby arugula, one decent piece of fried goat cheese and a few bits of pistachio brittle, extremely dry croutons and some tart cherry jam (not impressive).  More is not always better, especially when it comes to lettuce (this is a theme with this place - stay tuned).  My second course was the King Salmon - wasabi mashed potatoes, blood orange, saikyo miso, and pickled cucumbers  My BIGGEST issue was the fact that they put mixed green lettuce between the hot potatoes and hot salmon so it wilted (gross) and I had to pick it all off.  The second issue was the complete overload of sauce.  The cucumbers were soggy and looked as sad as I was.  As a whole, not great at all.  Last was the sweet cake dessert, it was some sort of cupcake like creation with caramel sauce on top and vanilla bean ice cream.  The cake was a little too sweet, but the ice cream was awesome.  Needless to say I'm glad we went on restaurant week and I didn't pay the full price of $25 for the soggy salmon.  There is a chance that restaurant week threw them off their game, but truth be told I don't feel sorry for them.  This is your chance to bait and lure a TON of people back to your restaurant.    Step your game up son!  Cam Newton would be disappointed!",

Calamari was ok, and the buns were definitely different. For dinner I went with the scallops and they were excellent. Nice big scallops and very tender. A couple martinis settled for a pretty good meal. Service was a tad slow, but they were pretty busy. Price is moderate to high. They have some menu options that are cheaper.

For one, food is over priced for what you get. I ordered duck fried rice which was ok but on the salty side. About 15 mins before our food came out, when the waitress finally came back to get our orders, I asked for an Irish coffee. We were completely done eating our food and then some by the time this tepid coffee came out to the table. So let's just say I waited about 45 mins prob more for Irish coffee...and got charged for it. Should I have expected that? I just thought that was terrible customer service. You see me completely done eating and my husband is asking you for the check and you don't think umm maybe I should try to get this taken off. I get they were busy, but you have to have some sort of customer service so people will actually want to come back after having less than ok service. But I didn't even say anything because I genuinely was so annoyed I just wanted to leave and who knew how long it would take to fix the situation if I'd complained about something. I can't see a time I would ever come back here.",

Big smile, warm, friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, just awesome. She suggested apps for us and shes tried them all. Thats my girl! Her suggestions were spot on delicious. We ordered the mini chicken meatball sliders with fresh mozzarella and red sauce(its gravy to this New Yorker) and I wondered why my Italian boyfriend would ever disgrace us by ordering a non-beef meatball. But, holy shit,  these were addictive !!!! Tender ground chicken, not dry, perfectly seasoned on a buttery toasted bun with melty mootz and sauce. I couldnt believe I loved them. I ordered the Crispy Tempura Rock Shrimp. Lightly battered and Fried, drizzled with a  light Creamy Honey Glaze on top of Crispy Rice Noodles. So Good, I ate leftovers for Breakfast. We also ordered the Burrata on crostini with Apricot and Heirloom Tomatoes. Wait, I don't think I got the tomatoes!! But, who cares? The creamy, fresh burrata with the sweet apricots on that crispy bread with a drizzle of honey was insanely simple and so good. Oh, and Baldie ordered the Boston Lettuce Wedge. One of the best salads ever, Putanas! The Stilton cheese was mild, the dressing was creamy, theapplewood bacon added a nice crunch. Dessert was Cissady's suggestion and it rocked! It's called Hot Chocolate Entremet and its like a chocolate mousse with a ganache and a melted marshmallow on top. OMG!!! We are going back!! You should, too!",

In fact I think everyone had experienced gastronomic orgasms- the food was that awesome!  I had the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection  (medium rare). Most of the others had the braised short ribs and all raved about it. As well as a few had the seared scallops. We all pretty much licked our plates clean! The staff were all equally pleasant and very accommodating.  All I can say is... Please open a location in Philadelphia!",

My dinner was a simple burger, but man it was yummy. My date had a kale salad with salmon that she really enjoyed too. Super fresh. Super bright.  Drinks were good. The house Cabernet was a little weird - tasted like a glass of pepper, but I should have just changed out for another drink.   Our waiter, Wes, was amazing. Smart, charming, funny, and knowledgeable.   The only reason I gave it four stars and not five was because the music was a little too loud and way out of step with the meal. It was top-40. Kind of strange.  I would recommend it fully. Go enjoy.",

The restaurant provides room service, which is equally as disappointing.   Tonight I had the Kobe short ribs which I was told was the \"what we are known for.\" If so, they are known for pushing a dish they don't know how to cook. The short ribs were served boneless which is not the preferred way, but that wasn't the problem. Instead of the fall apart tender that is expected with short ribs, especially a special product like Kobe beef, they were so tough I had trouble chewing them. The fat was not rendered. They were not prepared properly.   the ribs were served on top of a bed of noodles. the noodles were so overcooked, they were just a bowl of mush. My mother doesn't overcook spaghetti this badly.   I was curious about the 'roasted avocado' appetizer. It was an elementary presentation of stale  french bread topped with goat cheese and a smear of avocado, with a cherry tomato on top. No integration of flavors. No sophistication whatsoever, just a bunch of ingredients piled on top of each other.   this place has a great view - the BEST in Charlotte. Come here and have a drink or a beer (no good options for wine by the glass), do NOT eat here or you will be disappointed. you have been warned.",

This place is located on the top floor of a hotel, and my oh my is the view beautiful.   We made reservations, because it was CRW, and I am thankful we did, the place was packed, so I took this in to consideration while waiting for my food.   But there was hardly a wait for my entree and appetizer. Which was so-so for my entree, my fiance's entree, which was the steak option, was above parr. He kept raving about his appetizer the chicken wings, which I trust were good, my appetizer the chicken springrolls were spicy for my personal taste, and my entree of the chicken pasta was so-so.  I was disappointed in desert, we waited about 20 minutes for our desert, and it was a  bread and butter cake, which ended up being a stale muffin.  Overall, I do not feel like I would come back here again, I felt like there was nothing here that was overall exceptional, besides the view of the rooftop.",

I'm about to show you how to make this experience magical if you're struggling with the price point: I always save money by splitting dishes with my husband or even better yet, if you order the Margarita pizza, which is delicious and huge, it will feed 3-4 people and it's only $16-$17! Split that and get some drinks while you enjoy one of the best views in Charlotte. It is an exquisite experience for half the cost. Take it from me- my boyfriend took me on one of our first dates here, and now we're married. I like to think their pizza had something to do with that. Impress your family or that smoking hot broad you like by taking them to this beautiful place and showing that you know how to create an amazing night without paying an arm and a leg. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because you're somewhat obligated to valet park your car. Despite that, the location is incredible and the food and drinks are great!",

Very awkward and uncomfortable- not knowledgeable about the menu at all. Our appetizer came before our drinks- at least 5 minutes before. After our dinner we grabbed after dinner drinks at the bar to go enjoy outside- bartender was horrible! Just not what you would expect from an upscale restaurant.

I want the one to make the reservation but apparently it's pretty tough and had to be booked several weeks in advance... We were running a little late and our Uber was too! We called to let them know and they informed us if we were not there by 10 min after our reservation time, our table would be given up. We ended up driving our own car to get there in time and had to park in the adjacent parking lot which costs around $10. The waitstaff was very nice and even though they were very busy, we got drinks and starters very quickly.  We pretty much ordered every appetizer to share between the 5 of us. The highlights were: wood grilled avocado (everyone's fav!), chicken spring rolls, chorizo dates, and tempura rock shrimp. The calamari and ahi poke nachos were also great! They have a pretty good cocktail menu too with unique flavor combos I haven't seen before. If I'd have had room I would've had one of the sweet ones for dessert! When the checks came we just split everything (plus what we had to drink) and were all amazed that it was between $15-25 per person. We literally tried everything!! Best of all the view was amazing. It's on the 22nd floor with the gorgeous \"Queen City\" in the background. Made for an excellent photo to remember the night. Great spot for an occasion or romantic date night. I'd love to come back for brunch the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try this since I have heard the view/food is amazing...but I was greatly disappointed. The view was wonderful and the pictures we took turned out great, but that was where the positives stopped. We had a reservation at 9pm, obviously not the peak dinner time, yet still had almost a 30 minute wait outside when the temperature was near freezing. The fire was nice, but not enough to keep you actually warm. The specialty drink menu only had one drink that even sounded decent (turns out it was not) and all were very overpriced.  When we were finally seated we orders appetizers of the lobster tacos (not much flavor, only 3 mini tacos per order) and calamari (best thing I ate). Since everything had been a bit of a let down I decided to get the filet mignon since steak is always my favorite. When I first got the steak I noticed it had some sort of glaze on it but when I cut into it I saw the perfectly medium cooked color and was excited. However, that first bite completely killed that mood. The glaze tasted like a sweet BBQ sauce which completely killed the natural flavor of the steak! I am certain the steak would have been delicious had they never put that glaze on top. In my opinion, if your steak needs a sauce to make it taste good, you are either not serving quality steak or you have no idea how to properly prepare and cook steak. When going into an establishment like this, with high prices like this, I expect my food to be amazing.  Overall I am sure this is a fun place to be during warmer weather and drinking classic drinks outside, but I will never come here again for dinner and certainly not when the night air isn't warm.",

The ahi tuna nachos were good but were swimming in sauce so I just picked out the tuna. The duck fried rice had a lot of flavor but was very salty. The calamari didn't have a crispy breading. For entrees, we had the wagyu steak and the scallops. The steak was average. They put 2 huge stalks of broccoli on the plate that was difficult to eat. The scallops were so salty I couldn't eat them. For dessert we order the chocolate and vanilla buttermilk ice cream. The chocolate ice cream was very rich and the vanilla tasted as it is named... Like buttermilk. We received a complimentary dessert of 2 bite sized peanut butter pies with \"happy anniversary\" written on the plate and a candle (which was the best item we had here).   Overall the whole meal was so salty. The atmosphere is great and the patio with the view is the main attraction. If we go again, we may try the pizza.

We also shared the Brussels sprouts which were flavorful as well, but don't think I'd order those again.  My entree was the lobster Mac and cheese and I've had better.  It was not the cheese combo, which is different than normal, that I didn't care for, it was the lobster which made the whole dish taste fishy and I don't care for that.  Fresh lobster is usually not fishy.... Don't know what the deal was with that.  All in all we had a good time, enjoyed the view, the drinks and the appetizer, but wouldn't rush back....

First I placed an order for a house Cabernet. After all the other drinks came, I waited and waited. After two waiters tried to take my wine glass I finally said \"I ordered wine, can you check on it?\" The waiter was very apologetic. It wasn't a big deal to me plus we were a group of 14, so it could have slipped his mind. No biggie. My friend and I decided to split a \"mr fungi\" pizza. Trust me, the pizzas are huge so you will want to share! It was very flavorful but really, I wasn't in the mood for pizza. The check came, I was shocked a house Cabernet was $12.50. I don't mind paying for good wine but a house wine over $10...? Anyways, we thanked the waiter, Corbin, and made our way outside for pictures. Overall, it was a great experience just not what I expected menu wise. Also, they REALLY need air conditioning on all the time. I was sweating just sitting.",

We got the meat/cheese plate $12 which I thought was a nice amount. The lobster rolls were really good.

But any server worth his or her salt should know how to present and pour $150 bottle of wine). Food was solid but nothing to necessarily brag about. Rave reviews of the cuisine from the other restaurant in Cleveland can't quite yet be attributable to Charlotte. Most everything we received from the kitchen was cold or room temperature at best -so hard to make a good judgment on cuisine. I had the pork tenderloin but it was set atop a cold mushy serving of sweet potatoes so tough to taste the flavoring itself. The apps were tasty and salad was fresh.   The decor itself is interesting - the fluorescent lights scour the eyes and diminish the elegance. And last. Be prepared to valet your car at the Hyatt downstairs and pay for parking.",

The view is 4 stars for sure, the food was average I expected better more even flavor between the diverse dishes we choose but a 1 star for the attitude of the hostess.  If it weren't for my setting this reservation as an after business dinner with out of town execs, I would have personally left and never returned.  They were more than unfriendly and quite snobbish.  Too bad, since I had being excited about visiting this restaurant for months.  I may return for the view and cocktails, while choosing to dine elsewhere.  Maybe!!!",

    "text": "Summary: Awesome menu but food was poorly executed. Good service, tasty cocktails and local beers. GREAT view and ambience. Parking too expensive.  Details: Came here on a Wednesday night for a 6:45 reservation. First impression was of a packed and energetic bar scene and an incredible view of downtown. We waited 10-15 minutes for a table, even though we had a reservation, and even though there were at least a half dozen tables visibly open. Kinda annoying, but fine.  Got seated with a menu, wine list, and cocktail/draft list. Waiter and a trainee came over within 2 minutes to welcome us and get drink orders. Shortly after he put the drink order in, he came back to go over specials and get appetizer order. We got the lobster roll appetizer, which came out pretty quickly. The flavor was great and it was perfectly dressed, but the bread tasted more stale than toasted, and the lobster-to-bread ratio was a bit low.   For entrees my wife went with the king crab ramen w/ pork belly ($42) and I got the 45-day dry aged strip steak ($49). The ramen broth was awesome--not too salty, with the perfect amount of truffle. Unfortunately it was light on king crab considering the price, and the pork belly was somehow overcooked and tough, yet also too fatty and not seared at all. The steak, which was ordered medium-rare, came out a solid medium and the fingerling potatoes (all 2 of them) were cold. The server agreed and promptly put in another order. 2nd steak was perfectly cooked when I first cut into it, yet I quickly found out that one side of it was actually more overcooked than the first one. On the plus side, part of the steak was great and this time they added a few extra fingerling potatoes. But it definitely wasn't a $49 entree, so at that price it was very disappointing.  The server was extremely apologetic about the steak and the manager came over and also apologized, and even offered us a complimentary dessert to make up for it. We got the Milk and Cookies (normally $8), which was supposed to be a chewy and decadent chocolate chip cookie served in a mini cast iron pan, and so rich and delicious that it comes with a small carafe of farm fresh milk. However it came out luke warm, overcooked, and honestly no tastier than a tollhouse cookie. At that point when they asked how dessert was, we just lied and said it was good. I was tired of complaining and my wife was embarrassed.  Why 3 stars when we clearly weren't impressed with the food? Because the service was good, they owned up to their mistakes, the menu and flavors were both strong, and the ambience and view were top notch. The kitchen simply didn't execute, which in the end can make or break your entire meal.",

    "text": "So, my boyfriend and I came in around 7:30 on a Sunday night. We were informed there weren't any more reservations for the evening but we could sit in the bar area. My first observation at Fahrenheit is that all the serving staff is young and lacking knowledge about customer service...or anything for that matter. We ordered two beers to start, two cocktails, calamari & green papaya salad as appetizers, and the ramen and filet for our entrees. Everything was pretty good until my boyfriends filet came out OBVIOUSLY over cooked and tough.  We were trying to be polite by not sending it back or complaining too much (not that we had any chance to complain because our server never came back to check and see if everything was done to our liking.) Finally, we had a chance to tell our inattentive server that the steak was over cooked and not enjoyable. She said she would speak to her \"manager\" about removing it from our bill. A guy in a horribly oversized and untailored suit came to our table to state his unprofessional opinion about why he couldn't remove it from our bill and said if we would have let him know sooner he could have done something about it and had a new filet cooked.  Let's get something straight, I understand that some folks think that complaining will just get them a free meal. But, when a couple comes in an orders 8 different items it's obvious were not just looking for a free meal.  Not removing our filet made your restaurant look cheap, disrespectful, and ridiculous.  Having a cook come out of the kitchen and talk shit in a corner together, laughing, and staring at us about how he thinks he is entitled to not admit he over cooked a damn steak is unprofessional and insulting to your customers.  And arguing with a customer about why their meal was inedible and not enjoyable without any apologies or recognition for a simple mistake made you look stupid.  My boyfriend went back up and asked for another filet to be cooked and put in a to-go box because we weren't going to leave a restaurant being forced to pay $45 dollars for a dish that never got to be eaten.  So we graciously gave our take out filet ordered to a homeless man on our walk home. And we graciously will never be returning to this restaurant because of the lack of professionalism and disgusting personalities of every employee in there.",

Maybe I lucked out with my order?  I sat at the bar and had appetizers and drinks.  We asked the bartender what was good and he directed us to a number of appetizers/small plates that were insanely delicious!  If you go, try at least one of either the chorizo bacon wrapped dates and/or the sweet potato biscut with lobster (both were fantastic).  Then on the ligher side we also tried to seared tuna wontons, which were less rich but equally good.  Obviously, atmosphere at this place cannot be beat, you can see the entire city skyline.  Gorgeous, especially now that it's summer and the weather is so nice in the evenings.",

We ended up being sat around 8:30- which was fine because we ended up grabbing a drink from the bar.  The service was terrible from the moment we sat down. Our server didn't come speak to us for about 10 minutes, he made us feel uncomfortable when we said tap water was fine, and didn't even ask if we wanted a new drink as ours were almost empty. We ordered new drinks and calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was fantastic by the way! However the cocktail my boyfriend ordered was not brought out until our entree was almost done and we had still yet to get any water. The server did not seem interested in us at all, but he did seem to like the tables surrounding us. It's too bad we ended up giving him a good tip because he definitely didn't deserve it. The only reason this is not getting less stars is because the filet and calamari we ordered was delicious. The filet was cooked as we asked and was tender as could be.",

Whenever you are able to go somewhere and see the amount of passion for the food being made, you know you will love it. Chef Rocco has a great vision for his menu and it was very well prepared.    The restaurant has an open concept kitchen with a Triangle-shaped bar that diners fill up according to their reservation time or just simply dine at. You can also be served around the bar by cocktail waitresses if you prefer that not so formal atmosphere, or have a reservation and get an intimate table away from the bar with a great view of Charlotte. You are more than likely going to meet fellow foodies here since this is definitely more of a social type restaurant with the large patio along the backside of the entire restaurant.  Bartenders at Fahrenheit are very knowledgeable and if you are lucky enough to get Tiffany as your bartender keep her! She is on point with her mixed drinks and her ability to get you that perfect drink to accent the meal you are about to enjoy.   Fahrenheit is definitely a great new addition to Charlotte and I plan on spending many more nights at this new hot spot.",

The food itself is good, it's just equally overpriced. I'm all for great gourmet food, but there are so many better options for this amount of money.",

My bartender by the name of john (I didn't get his last name) was very helpful on suggesting a drink and gave me the history behind the restaurant. Then came dinner, the food is fancy and delicious. From our stuffed date appetizer to our short rib dinner we were beyond impressed. We went for my gf's birthday and we received a decorated plate with  happy birthday written on it and a warm fudge brownie. We will be back for Valentine's Day!",

We finished our dinner and went back to the bar and had two more drinks after our dinner. When we finished and were given our tab. Our original drinks were on the bill we had already paid for. We asked the bartender to remove them which they did but then she said they are authorized to leave peoples tabs open after they sign them and close out. This is obviously not right so we asked to speak with a manager. Adam Quigley service manager came up and said it is more important for his bartenders to face the people at the bar then worry about the closing out tabs when people leave. Here is my question....we are vigilant about everything surrounding our credit cards, how many people pay no attention at all and how much extra money is Fahrenheit charging people?",

    "text": "Probably one of the worst experiences I've had at an upscale restaurant. If I could give it zero stars I would. I came to visit my friend who lives in town and we went to the annual pub crawl charlotte had going on downtown. We had t shirts and jeans on and decided to go to Fahrenheit because it was one of the few places open that was not overflowing with people. We take an elevator to get into the high rise restaurant, walk in and are immediately told there is not any inside seating for at least 2 hours. However, there were quite a few tables open in the front that would have accommodated all four of my friends. Mind you we are sober, not haggardly dressed or drawing attention to ourselves in any negative way. Just hungry and tired. So, we ask if we can be seated outside and they tell us sure and to find a table and we will be accommodated. The moment we sit down outside a blonde waitress with a high pony tail and bright fuchsia lipstick tells us we have to put a credit card down in order to eat here. I'm shocked because I've never been asked to do that. I'm in my mid twenties and so are my confidants in my presence. We've eaten at a lot more upscale restaurants where we were never asked to put down a card. As if we could of dined and dashed on the 22nd floor of this roof top restaurant. But regardless, this woman didn't introduce herself or give us any direction or reason for putting down a card. I ended up giving her my card to save time because at this point we are starving. The food while good, was definitely not worth the price but all that aside, our waitress never checked on us, took quite a long time to get our food. At this point it's dark outside and we are ready to eat and get the check. So, we wait an additional hour for our waitress to bring our checks after asking the wait staff around us catering to THEIR tables to grab ours so we could get OUT! She finally comes back, I pay in cash and tell her to keep the change because I can't wait another hour for her to get back. Definitely over tipped, not because I wanted to... so after all of that she says I can come meet her at the front of the restaurant inside to get my card. Waited an additional 5 minutes for that because of course she had to check on her other tables and make sure they were taken care of. It was a level of unprofessional that I had not experienced in a long time in terms of a high class restaurant. Not that it's 5 stars or anything to begin with but that's the vibe this place is definitely trying to instill. With the location and everything you would expect a little more professionalism. The whole experience was absolutely ridiculous and between all four of us we probably racked up over a $100 tab with food and drinks. Overall, Fahrenheit was a massive disappointment. Take your business and money elsewhere. There are far better places to enjoy yourself in the Charlotte area where the wait staff is attentive and pleasant and non discriminatory.",

I love their cocktails and even their bar bites. The Korean pork tacos are incredible.   The part that leaves me conflicted about Fahrenheit is the restaurant. I suppose you could choose to never eat in the dining section, which would be wise, but I did a couple times. The service in the dining area is brutal. Both times I have dined, I watched my server stand around and just kick it by the kitchen while they BS'd with other staff. I get the delay for cocktails at times, but they took over 20 minutes for a bottle of wine. The food was the same story.   The bar area and patio are so good, it's worth going here from time to time, but I would recommend avoiding the dining area.",

This is probably not the place to take a date for a more romantic quiet dining experience. Otherwise, I'd suggest it to anyone that would like good food, good service, and a great venue and view.",

The outdoor fire pits are dazzling and elegant and service has always been stellar. The food that I've tried has been pretty decent too, but keep in mind the portions may be a little petite depending on what you choose to order.

    "text": "The hostesses were pleasant enough.  I asked them to point me to the bar (for fun, because the bar is the first thing you see when you walk in) and they both pointed wordlessly.  I said thank you and took a seat.   I could see the service printer from my seat and it was spitting out tickets at a good pace, so I decided to forgo a signature cocktail in favor of the quicker and easier vodka soda.   TINY DETAIL #1 The lemon garnish was a whole wheel, no slit, dropped into the drink.  Purely for decoration, not to add flavor- unless you want to first reach into your drink and then get your fingers all full of lemon juice trying to squeeze it (which I did, I ain't skeered).  The bartender was new, and working hard.  She clearly knew what she was doing behind a bar but did not yet know the menu.  I asked if the elote was served on the cob and she had to ask someone else (it is). I decided instead on the chorizo dates, but they were 86'd.   TINY DETAIL #2 Offering something so delicious-looking on the page then failing to deliver on the plate is not good.  It's like a broken promise.  Restaurants run out of things sometimes.  I get that.  But when you have a dish on the menu that you can't serve, anyone who orders it gets disappointed.  Not the way to start off a nice dinner.   I ordered the wood-smoked avocado and it was f***ing phenomenal.  I took the time to scoop it out and spread it on the grilled bread- messy but fun- and together with the creamy goat cheese my mouth was super happy.  The line cook put a single unsliced cherry tomato in the mix, daring me to stab it with my fork.  Recalcitrant as all cherry tomatoes are, it proved too much for my attempts so finally i picked it up with two fingers and submitted it to its fate.  The other, properly halved tomatoes amid the avocado yielded themselves to my fork with ease.  Nobody asked me whether I enjoyed the dish, though the answer was patent by looking at my clean plate.  I went to the restroom to wash my hands.  It was mostly clean but kind of an afterthought.  No decoration, no accoutrement. TINY DETAIL #3  A scented candle and some fancy hand sanitizer go a long way toward making a visit to the can something special.  A washroom attendant would be over the top but, particularly in a venue like this where people frequently take dates for romantic dinners, an elegant container full of mouthwash on the vanity would be a pleasant and utile surprise.  I ventured outside.  The rooftop view of the city is astounding, of course, but looking over the gas fireplaces back into the restaurant is a view even more charming.  Only flames and the silhouettes of ladies and gentlemen are visible.  It's like watching an old movie.  If you go outside, be prepared to have people ask you to take their picture with the city in the backdrop.  I photographed a newly engaged couple and wished them well.  Neither one threw the other over the railing so I assume they'll live happily ever after.  Back at the bar, nightclub-ish music still playing, crowd still buzzing, I noticed a half-empty bottle of Louis XIII on the top shelf and next to it, a full bottle of something I couldn't identify.  I meant to ask the bartender but she was still cranking out service drinks.  I meant to ask the manager but he did NOT want to be seen.  He was busy, and his business was not with the guests.  Actually I'm only assuming he was the manager: he was wearing a suit and had an earpiece like a secret service agent.  I tried to get his attention twice, both times he rushed past like the kitchen might be on fire (that does happen).  Finally I just interrupted the nearest employee, and she said it was Hennessy but didn't know how old it was.  If I wanted to order a glass of it nobody seemed interested in selling it to me.  When the bartender had five seconds to take a deep breath, she told me it's not actually that busy.  The manager behaved more like a Vegas pit boss than a maitre d', and no other employees acknowledged my existence or asked me how my experience had been.  There wasn't anyone handling the guests.  Everyone seemed too busy. TINY DETAIL #4 Someone needs to be focused on the guests' experience.  Overall, I think this place is getting by on its t*ts, as they say.  One of the best locations in the city and the food (what I had) was remarkable, but the service could use a little polishing.  If they want to keep their reputation as the classiest place in town they're going to have to pay attention to the TINY DETAILS.    That's what separates good from great.",

I contacted these guys in regards to booking my engagement party in which the representative on the phone took all my information and assured me someone would call me back. A day goes by and because of the urgency of my approval I contacted Fahrenheit again. This time I got someone on the phone and they said that the restaurant was booked and had actually been booked for a couple weeks out as there's lots of events happening downtown Charlotte and they would not be able to accommodate us. Because of my desire to have my party at Fahrenheit I wasted an entire day waiting on a call back only if the first rep that I talk to new what the second rep knew I wouldn't have been waiting and wasting days.  **Please pardon my mistakes as I'm using Siri to dictate",

The only reason I'm giving it two stars, but is the most important thing, is because the food sucked. We ordered a margarita pizza (which is hard to mess up), but the bottom was completly burnt and had very little cheese to barely cover it. We had the chorizo-stuffed dates, it was really just bacon and not chorizo, with a pretty flower on it. We had the \"nachos\", which was just state-fair greasy potato chips. Lastly, we ordered a vietnamese salad which was very oily and sticky, not pleasant. What this restaurant needs to make it top notch, is a new chef and menu. Maybe a nice sushi bar or steakhouse? Would be perfect with the ambiance.",

    "text": "We are new to Charlotte and heard about the great rooftop view at Fahrenheit so we decided to try it during Queen's Feast Restaurant Week. We were so disappointed! They really cheaped out with low quality ingredients and flavorless food. I felt like they took advantage of everyone during restaurant week, serving food they would hopefully never serve on their normal menu. The service was barely adequate but they forced a 20% service fee on us. When we tried to give feedback about our experience, we were rudely brushed off and completely ignored.   It's a beautiful view...But the food tasted like a cheap chain restaurant. Even restaurant week prices were way overpriced for the quality.   We will certainly never return and I've already told dozens of people about how terrible our experience was.   My suggestion to the management: Drop out of restaurant week, fire your chef, revamp the menu, invest in quality ingredients, retrain the staff to focus on customer service.",

We were seated at a four top and could barely hear each other talk.  The server took awhile to greet us.  It seemed as though she may have had too many tables and was sat multiple tables at the same time.  We ordered a bottle of white wine and we were not offered a wine chiller.  She did not check back after the food was delivered to ask us how the food was.  When she was clearing plates, she had us hand them to her rather than walking around and picking them up.  There were tables that sat down after us that had received their dessert and check before us.  The dessert was supposed to come with ice cream and there was no ice cream to be seen.  When we questioned the server, she indicated that they ran out.  Were you going to tell us or offer us something else??  It took us over two hours for four of us to have dinner.  We are not slow eaters, but felt like we were waiting around for the server to come back to our table.  We do not feel as though she gave us adequate attention.  I expected a higher quality of service from this particular restaurant.  I have been a server before and I know that it is not easy; however, you expect the basics of serving to be demonstrated at a restaurant that strives to be in the top tier.",

    "text": "We left angry and disappointed by the horrible customer service!  A shame, since we'd been very excited to try Fahrenheit after it had been recommended by several friends and the Yelp ratings seemed so positive.   We arrived on Sunday night (8/31/14) for our reservation and were shown to a table right next to the kitchen. When we requested to move to a table by the windows or closer to the window to appreciate the view, we were treated extremely rudely and with an unnecessary amount of attitude by the hostess (Cassandra).  Although there were TWO open window tables and it was not crowded at all, Cassandra refused to seat us at those, saying that one was \"specifically reserved\" and the other was \"recommended for a birthday occassion\".  Um...not sure what that means, and in any event, our dinner was a birthday occasion too!  By this time TWO more tables had opened up by the windows and she still refused to sit us at one of them.  So really, FOUR open tables and not one of them is available?!  At this point, I asked, \"So no matter what other tables open up, you are only offering us [the one by the kitchen]?\" To which the response was \"yes\".  No attempt to try to accommodate our request or to even act like good customer service was a priority!    To be fair, Alex, the other hostess, was nice, and even apologized for Cassandra's behavior.  It's usually not a good sign when one employee apologizes to customers for a colleague...    We left and went to another uptown restaurant where we spent good money.  No view of the city is worth substandard customer service!    (Note that I was really surprised by the rude, almost NYC-like attitude in NC.  Even the best restaurants in New York pride themselves on good customer service.  Luckily, this was the ONLY rude encounter I had when visiting North Carolina.)",

Great music, food and drink. We came back for dinner and our waiter was Chris. He was freaking awesome!!! Was so polite about everything. We didn't have to ask him to refill our drinks. He wasn't hovering over us about the food. The table we sat at had a beautiful view of the city of Charlotte. We first ordered calamari as our appetizer. It was ok. More on the salty side. Then I ordered the wedge salad and my boyfriend ordered the avocado salad. We ended up switching because I LOVED his salad. FREAKING DELICIOUS!!! Then our entree came out. I had the salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes and my boyfriend had the braised short ribs with lo mein. AMAZING!!! My salon was on point. The best salon I have ever had. The wasabi mashed potatoes made it even better. My boyfriend LOVED his short ribs. It just fell apart and melted in your mouth and the lo mein was soft and not chewy. We were ready to check out and when we were getting our check back, they came out with a plate that said happy birthday and a piece of cake (which was great too!!!) with a candle on it. They ABSOLUTELY took care of us. We loved it sooo much. Thank you so much Chris!!! Make sure to ask for him when you guys dine there.",

The music was loud even in the main dining room and Katy Perry isn't what I expect to hear over dinner.    We were seated at a table near a door to the outside patio, everyone that worked there was coming in and out and the wind nailed us everytime. I mentioned it to the waiter they were apologetic and eventually moved us, so that was addressed.  We could still feel the cold wind everytime the door was used though.     We had the confit wings, which were good and the Vietnamese spring rolls which were just ok.  My husband had the bone in ribeye special.  It came sitting on a bed of olive oil, a LOT of olive oil, and was topped with some kind of tapenade, this had not been mentioned in the explanation of the dish and it was just strange. The ribeye was supposed to be medium rare but it was so under cooked it was purple, literally raw.   They took it back and it came back so overlooked he just didn't eat it.  Again, they apologized and took that and the apps off the bill.  My pork tenderloin was over cooked and the whipped sweet potatoes were not whipped at all and actually tasted watery, like they had been boiled.  The garlic on the spinach was raw, so really strong. We did enjoy the lobster tail that came with the ribeye.     We had other issues, but these are the highlights. I wish I could say that these were new restaurant kinks that need to be worked out, but even the food that wasn't messed up was underwealming.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went to Fahrenheit for our two-year anniversary to get drinks and desert.  The place was packed so I went to the bar to get our first round of drinks, I had to wait at the bar for about 15 minutes before I was finally served, two bartenders were chatting right in front of me for several minutes with neither asking if I needed anything.  I finally ordered her first drink, the \"Sweet Georgia Brown,\" and I ordered myself a Manhattan.  I could see the bartender making our drinks and could tell that he was unsure how to make them.  The description for the Sweet Georgia Brown has \"spiced and pickled peaches\" in it; all I saw him put in the drink was the whiskey and chile, the drink was overly spicy to the point where she could not drink it and I was barely able to drink it, not a pleasant cocktail.  I was also able to observe my Manhattan being made, a classic Manhattan calls for a 2:1 ratio of whiskey to vermouth, I received a 1:1 ratio, there was no cherry added and the drink was served in the smallest rocks glass I have ever seen; I was most surprised to see that my poorly made mini-Manhattan cost $15.  We then sat down at a table outside, we finished our cocktails and were waiting for a waitress to come by to take our drink and desert order.  We sat there for a while, before security noticed us and alerted a waitress to check on us.  We placed our order, a dirty Martini and the \"Copper Irishman\" to drink, along with the \"Chocolate and Coconut Pot de Creme.\"  We waited for about 15 minutes for our cocktails to be delivered, this round of cocktails was much better than the previous drinks we had ordered.  About 10 minutes later the desert came, tasty but nothing special.  Our waitress finally returned after 20 or 30 minutes to check on us, we asked for the check, and after a longer than normal amount of time brought it to us.  After paying, we gave up our table to others waiting and walked around the patio area; as poor as the service and drinks were, that did not lessen the great view of the city the place has.",

The bar was not crowded, the servers were attentive and the drinks were perfectly made (not the rule for straight-up cocktails in Charlotte bars). Lobster roll concoction tasted good (buttered brioche bread!) but not much lobster (maybe it should have a different name?); calamari had a wonderful Thai-style dressing but could have been a bit crisper (I would order it again). Bill came to 53 USD. Views are lovely, and we strolled along the 3-sided outdoor rooftop. There is a vegetable and herb garden; outdoor seating; a really small pool (quick dunk?). All told, it was a good 'hang' for us.The  entrees don't particularly attract our taste in dining out, but we will certainly come back for apps and drinks. Parking for this oddly situated building on Caldwell is problematic (did I mention the views?). If there are no immediate parking spots available on 3rd Street, I highly recommend that you not waste your time, but leave your car with the valet parking (7 clams with validation).",

The view was amazing, the blackberry bramble cocktails were awesome, and the salted caramel cheesecake was fabulous. It is very crowded and you will need reservations for dinner, the bar was packed but we spent about 10 minutes outside and found a table in the bar. Highly recommend!",

First, opens @ 4pm but when i walked in @ 3:58pm, because the door was open, the hostess turned me back outside just to turn around & welcome me back in 2 min later. Then it took for ever to get a beer even though there were very few customers. The bartender seemed to be annoyed of having to serve but finally took my order. Began pouring my beer & the keg went dry. Rather than waiting for me to pick another drink, he left. Finally came back & took my order. Then I asked if they could change the channel on the tv to the USA soccer game & the manager did not allow it. When I confronted the manager he said that they were not a sports bar even though they were currently showing golf & basketball. Check please!",

You have a view of the whole city from your table or walk outside an have a cocktail in the fresh charlotte air. The bar is fun and exciting for young and old. They use local farm fresh ingredients. An there staff was on top of there game. If you want great food with an amazing view. Try it you can't go wrong.",

    "text": "I'm obviously not in the demographic that this restaurant is trying to reach (not young and hip with an endless expense account).  This place was recommended to us to try and it was exciting to expect a memorable dining experience with such a view of the city.  The view is incredible and after dark it is probably more so.  That was nearly the only positive of the experience.  I HIGHLY recommend the wedge salad as it is not made with your typical iceberg lettuce and the homemade blue cheese dressing was awesome.  That's where the positive ends.  My daughter and I split their Shrimp Pad Thai and while it was good, the noodles were scarce and overcooked.  And she found what appeared to be a piece of a toothpick in the dish.  While the server seemed concerned, she didn't really get overly excited about it and brushed it off as part of a brush used in the preparation (a wooden brush?).  She offered as a free dessert to make up for the error and served it without even asking if that would sooth our upset emotions.  It was some kind of chocolate cake with lots of goo on top which really wasn't edible.  There were three apparently homemade chocolates on the plate too which were good.  The food we got was way overpriced for what it entailed.  We won't be returning to Farenheit although I doubt we'll be missed.",

We had a reservation, and waited about 15 minutes.The ambiance was nice (reminds me of a NYC restaurant) and the view is great. Service was slow, but friendly. The menu is rather small, but adequate. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. The spicy sauce made it tasty, but the dish was mostly breading. I ordered scallops with creamy cauliflower, and my husband ordered the pork chop. I've never had scallops so I can't really compare, but the chop was AMAZING! Overall it was pretty good, but I think if I come back it would be for cocktails.",

    "text": "Ate here tonight on Valentine's Day, and was surprised that I enjoyed it after reading some of these reviews. We had the pork steamed buns as an appetizer and they were excellent. I had the scallops and my date had the ribeye. Both dishes were very good. Dessert was the salted caramel cheesecake, which was horrible. No flavor, except the overwhelming flavor of the crust. We had two cocktails which were great and a glass of iced wine for dessert.   As everyone already stated, the view is beautiful and I love the fire that wraps around the restaurant. You can even see the flames from the inside.  I do think the menu is overpriced by about $10 a plate, the food is good but nothing spectacular. I would rather dine at other restaurants uptown for this price range. I would definitely go back for appetizers and drinks. I'm not sure I would eat dinner again, though.   Overall it was a good experience. I would probably try this place at least once if you haven't already!",

There was a group of people at a table next to us who seem to be having fun but was extremely loud. We asked to be seated at another table because it was hard to hear one another talk with so much noise. We were immediately seated somewhere else and we began to place our orders:   Drinks  Not good at all!  Pinot Grigio is one of my favorite drinks. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio but when I got the drink it didn't smell like a hint of what I'm use too. However, i gave it a taste but my glass of wine didn't taste like what I ordered. I tried to order another glass but same results. I have a good palate when it come to wine and it just didn't taste like Pinot Grigio. What seem unusual the other person at the table said their brand vodka did not taste like the brand they ordered. I decided to try another white wine which was ok.  (1star for the drinks)  Food I ordered the salmon which turned out be flavorful and really delicious. I like my food HOT! It wasn't as hot as I would like but it was still good. It looked so good a person at another table asked what did I order on the menu lol. The entire table was satisfied with the food (4stars for the food and 5 for the atmosphere)   Overall The food was flavorful, atmosphere was great, service was good, and everyone was friendly!!  After leaving the dinning area we went out to enjoy Fahrenheit outside patio and the view of Queen City.",

I'm going to tell you:  We came here because we were celebrating a recent promotion between the two of us. My hubs.  We were staying at the Ritz so naturally we needed to have a place that matched in a dinning experience. We walked from the Ritz over to the restaurant (in 6 inch Red Bottoms) and I was still in a good.  We walked into the hotel lobby and the receptionist pointed us to the correct elevator and told us what floor even before we had a chance to ask.  I really had mid-grade expectation because I know sometimes when a restaurant is all the rage or hyped up it can be a huge let down.  Or it's the opposite where there are so so reviews and I end up loving it. Anyway...  Our server was awesome.  We liked him...he had an interest in us and we took interest in him.  So easy to talk to!! He saw that we wanted to take a picture out on the patio since the view was so stunning! He offered to take our picture for us!   Hubs ordered the Steak and I ordered the halibut.  Both were cooked and flavored to perfection.  I've never seen my husband eat so fast and in utter silence.  Zoned and in the moment. Portion sizes were also bigger than I had expected.  Some fancy restaurants give you these small portions sizes with a \"Texas size\" price tag and it's annoying.  Not this place.  Sure it's expensive but I felt like it was well worth it.",

She made sure we were always taken care of and explained the menu very well for us. The drinks were amazing. I love that they serve warm bread with this delicious butter with chives before your meal. For dinner I had the scallops which were served with  creamy Cauliflower Puree, Brussels Sprouts, Bacon, Pomegranate Molasse. Everything about this dish was spectacular! For dessert I tried the Goat Cheese Cake which was served with spiced blueberry compote, black pepper pecans, orange-basil sorbet. It was very different but delicious. The views from this establishment were amazing! I could just go there and sit by their rooftop fireplace and enjoy the views.   I highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "When: Sunday Brunch 1145a  Pros: Nice atmosphere and Beautiful views. Clean and hostess very nice and professional. Fried Chicken had good flavoring and lamb sausage was pretty good. Diced Potatoes were nicely cooked and flavored (best part of the meal)   Cons: food was very subpar and for $84 for 4 people 2 adults and 2 children (7-14), I definitely expected better. The girls had the CPT crunch pancakes and the brioche French toast. The French toast came with some type of cream of wheat topping slopped on the French toast and the CPT crunch pancakes were entirely too huge with some CPT crunch cereal pieces topped on it. Why??? I myself had the chicken and waffles option, Waffles were okay and the chicken was a chicken leg and breast. Why you would put bone in chicken on top of waffles I do not know. Now I as the customer have to work extra to cut around the bone just to enjoy My meal. The loco moco was just that, loco. Ramen noodles cooked and shaped into a patty and Fried, lamb sausage in a patty form and egg cooked over medium. Crazy combo but needs some more thought. Everyone's bacon was nothing but fat and little cooked again for $84 I should not have to ask if our bacon can be cooked all the way.   Suggestions: instead of bone in chicken try either chicken breast or tenders, fully cooked bacon, if waitress is serving a family with kids ask if the cream of wheat topping is okay and have two options for the pancakes small and large. Also, maybe use a pulled lamb option as oppose the patty and let the ramen noodles go or have another option like a potato pancake or even over their potatoes.   I am not completely writing this restaurant off I believe their dinner menu might be a better suited for us, brunch just didn't go over so well.",

    "text": "Been here twice already and last night was a big disappointment. You were basically paying for the view when you come here. And with the amount you're paying for your foods and drinks, something high end like this restaurant you would expect parking to be complimentary. NOPE.  The first time I was there, I was blown away by the nightlife city view. But that was pretty much it.  Nothing else was appealing. The foods I have to say, I didn't even want to finish it. It was so mediocre for the price range!   Last night I was there for a dinner party and I know when accommodating a large group, it can get overwhelming. I came late (my fault) and never asked once had anyone took my orders. While the rest of the guests ate (which was so gross, some didn't even touch their meals), I sat and watch. Thanks a lot Fahrenheit for the customer service. I do feel bad there were so many commotion going on but one of the server was extremely rude to all the guests.  Yes, it was busy but there's no need for attitude.  To keep this short, foods was far from a 'top chef' ordeal. Everyone was disappointed.  Lobster Biqsue tasted like they brought it from Costco, diluted it and served it to the dinner party.",

So we tried the tangerine dream.... it was awful. I'm sorry and I don't mean to be mean when I say it but that's why it was only four stars. Our server was KC, and for being 10 pm at night he was still on point. When we told him we didn't like the drinks he got us new ones right away, Long Island iced tea. Those were so good!

My fiance and I came here for our anniversary dinner- I had the lobster Mac & cheese, he had seared tuna and we got the bacon wrapped figs for our appetizer.  First of all, bacon wrapped anything is a gift from God himself, and these dates were the perfect testament to that. The crispness of the bacon countered by the creamy, sweetness of the figs literally caused a mouth-gasm. Only my second in life, so bravo.  The lobster Mac and cheese was very rich and the lobster was cooked perfectly. Even though it wasn't a large portion, I still had to take some home because the dish was so decadent.  Hubby enjoyed his seared tuna dish, but thought that the fried noodles were too much to navigate around.   We'll definitely be coming back for another go-round of Chef Rocco's tasty selections.",

I think this establishment is definitely for a younger group and mainly just for the view and a drink.  After we were seated I noticed that there were many empty tables.  Friday night 8 pm?   Our waitress was very good and the general manager came to our table several times and was great.  The food, what can I say about the food? Our table had a bone in ribeye that had a lot of fat in it even for a ribeye.  Also ordered a filet, it was cooked perfectly but was only lukewarm by the time it got to us.  As a Ruth's Chris fan a hot steak is hard to beat.  We had a couple of appetizers that were good but not outstanding. In summary, go for the view, have a drink, take your picture but don't expect over the top food.  Price $180 for four and we split entrees.",

The view is breathtaking with a glassed patio that wraps around the place.  There are no shortage of places to have a awesome photo taken or even a selfie :-)   I would say to make a reservation if you are really hungry.  The bar and outside patio are first-come, but always full.    The menu has some great choices for appetizers although the \"Charlotte Nachos\" is a winner every time.  It is humongous and delicious.  Also, I'm not sure what they put in their soda, maybe crack, but is the BEST tasting Pepsi I have ever had.  Their wine options and cocktails are also a must!!    I enjoyed the fried cauliflower with capers and cheese slices.  So, so good!!!  Seasoned to the point that you forget it isn't meat!  And the Vietnamese spring rolls were FULL of chicken and a slight curry flavor that left me wanting more.    In the cooler parts if the afternoon, they open the walls up so there is a nice view and open breeze from the outside.  Don't worry if you get cold easily, there are huge glass fire pits outside to keep you toasty.    This is the happening place to be in Charlotte.  I really enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back!!",

Vegans eat more than salads you know, so step your game up there.  #2. I ordered from the vegan menu.  The first salad?  Full of pancetta.  They remade it and brought out a second one--cheese in it.  There was no communication between the server and the kitchen and I was THOROUGHLY disappointed.  The only bright spot was the lemongrass rice; I have to admit that was awesome.

    "text": "Everyone and their brother recommended Fahrenheit, so I chose that for my birthday dinner. It also did not disappoint. The food was perfect, the service was excellent. But even if both had sucked, the view of our beautiful city would have helped make up for it.  Graham ordered beer, I had a cocktail, the '2nd Ward', and it was made of Muddy Rivers Rum, fresh pineapple juice, Rotham and Winter Orchard Apricot, & Kassatly Chtaura Orgeat, and it was delicious. It wasn't overly strong or super sweet.  For an appetizer, we had the Ahi Tuna Wontons with pickled and candied Fresno peppers and peach. I loved this, Graham wasn't as impressed. He said his bites didn't have any flavor. I thought it was a wonderful combination of spicy and sweet; but it could have used a little more salt. He also picked his cilantro off and gave it to me, so I have no sympathy for him...  Some of the reviews for Fahrenheit complained about portion sizes, so I was a little concerned before we ordered. Portion sizes are always something I worry about. I don't want a meal so huge I feel miserable, but I want more than one scallop, two mushrooms and a piece of asparagus (*ahem* Savoy 1620 *ahem*). When our meals came out, my fears were laid to rest. Both of our dinners were good sized portions  For my main course, I had the salmon (of course). This was King Salmon, with wasabi mashed potatoes, blood orange saikyo miso and pickled cucumbers and carrots. This was AMAZING. The salmon was huge and perfectly cooked. The potatoes had just a hint of wasabi, but not enough to be overwhelming. I gave Graham a bite, and all the flavors together reminded him of a sushi roll.  Graham had one of their specials: the tempura scallops. This came with asparagus, fennel and a tomato aioli and was just as delicious as my salmon. I've never had fried scallops before, but they were wonderful. The scallops were huge & perfectly cooked, and the aioli was the perfect compliment.  This is an excellent place for a special dinner. The service was excellent, the food was amazing, and you can not beat the view.",

    "text": "I recently had an amazing birthday dinner at Fahrenheit.  My partner and I made a reservation for 7:30 pm on a Friday night.  We arrived around 7 p.m. to grab a drink and enjoy the rooftop bar.  We had a vodka martini and moscow mule - they were both made very well. We enjoyed the sun beginning to set over the skyline while we stood near gas fire pits.  At 7:30, we were promptly seated - at first, we were going to be seated behind a wall with no view of the skyline, but we asked to be moved and were given a table with a lovely view.  Our server was knowledgeable and attentive.  We started with the kale and brussel sprout salad - more kale than brussel sprouts, which I found a bit disappointing - and the chorizo stuffed dates.  The latter came with about 8 dates - very rich and tasty.  We then enjoyed the short ribs (one of the best things I have ever eaten) and the seared scallops.  I tend to find scallop main courses to be fairly small - this was no exception, but they were very delicious.    We were both celebrating a birthday that evening, so our server brought us both out a small birthday cake with a candle.  It was a nice and unexpected touch.    The food, service and atmosphere were all top notch. I would recommend Fahrenheit to anyone for a special occasion dinner.",

I reserved a table for two and we ordered the margherita pizza and the coal roasted chicken mac and cheese. The food arrived quickly and was absolutely delicious! Some items on the menu are a little pricey but from my point of view the food is definitely worth it. Food and service aside, the restaurant is in an awesome location. 21st floor in the heart of downtown Charlotte. If anything you can enjoy the beautiful view! All in all it was a very pleasant dinner and I will definitely consider coming back next time I'm in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I'd say this place teeters between 3 and 4 stars, leaning closer to 3. For starters -- I heard about Fahrenheit after doing some research on good rooftop bars in Charlotte. Coming from NYC and being a rooftop afficionado, I was eager to see what the CLT skyline looked like. Fahrenheit does not disappoint.   The layout of the venue is a bit odd, which is what made our time there awkward. There was a private party beginning at 7, but the party reserved four big areas of the relatively small venue, leaving very little space for anyone to sit down. The staff closed down those areas well in advance of the private party, so it just looked like there were a bunch of empty areas.  Ambiance itself was great. I enjoyed the overall vibe of the place. When I got there, I worried it would be a little pretentious, but much to the contrary. The staff was helpful if you reached out, although they didn't make much of an effort to go out of their way to be helpful. This was particularly unfortunate because, again, the layout of the venue is not entirely intuitive.  TIPS: 1) There are three or four small round tables that are first come-first serve, but no signage would indicate that. So if you're having trouble grabbing a seat at the bar, ask the hostess where the first come first serve seating is. 2)  There are three separate entrances to the outdoor area. But there aren't any signs that would indicate this. Take the time to peruse the whole spot before you settle on an outdoor area. 3) My boyfriend had the mezcal drink and I can't say we were thrilled about it. The Angel Aviation drink is made w/ gin and very refreshing. 4) Bring a jacket. They don't have operating heat lamps outside, so it will behoove you to bring something to keep warm.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago My friend and I had lunch at Fahrenheit, unfortunately I did not leave impressed. I got the King Crab Benedict and my guest had the Jumbo Cap'N Crunch Pancakes. The Benedict was not bad but the poached egg was over cooked and the dish was not very hot either. The Jumbo Cap'N Crunch Pancakes was just overwhelmingly sweet. We didn't have the best service either but I understand that everyone has good days and bad days so I will not be holding that against them. The restaurant was very well designed and the view was fantastic. Overall I feel like that our $60 brunch without alcohol was overpriced and we paid for the view rather than a quality brunch. Being that this is my first time eating at this restaurant, I'm willing to give them a second chance and by trying their dinner menu sometime in the near future. Hopefully I'm able to give a better review sometime soon!",

The day of, they called to let us know that they can't honor our reservation because we weren't eating dinner there (even though we were ordering appetizers). They told us that if we are coming for drinks and apps, it's first come first serve. First of all, I think that's kind of lame. But second of all, and most importantly, why wait until the day of to tell us?!  Anyways, we got there and got a table outside that was a community table. Given our big party, there was only room for three or four people to sit at the other end. I was okay with that. Our party of six ordered several drinks each and apps to share. We got the Charlotte nachos (which was good and a portion good for sharing) and the grilled avocado (sooooooo good but needed at least double the amount of bread with it). Our waitress was somewhat attentive but I got the feeling that she had a ton of tables. We had to flag her down if we needed something. But she was nice nonetheless.   In all, the view is pretty. On a good day, it's nice to sit outside. The food is pricey but tasty. The reservation mishap was a big deal to me just because I think it is reflection of customer service. I would give it 3.5 stars, so I'm gonna round it up to a 4.",

The valet was amazing and very inexpensive! It was only $10 and you are able to add that onto your bill upstairs if you don't have cash. Once we arrived upstairs the hostess was very friendly and sat us immediately. (We had a reservation) We were seated at a table facing the beautiful skyline. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful! I ordered the Dark Chocolate Swiss Roll and it was insane! It was so yummy! My husband got the banana pudding and he loved it! Our waitress checked on us a few times and was always amazing!  After we had paid we went outside and got to enjoy the view!! Wowowowowow! It was the highlight of our evening!! I cannot day enough great things about the outside area! It was a little chilly but they had a fire out that you could warm up by!   My husband and I cannot wait to go back and get a full meal!

    "text": "The fella made reservations here for Valentine's Day, and I was excited to see it come up on \"Most Romantic Restaurant\" lists leading up.  Fahrenheit definitely has an upscale club vibe, so I don't recommend it for an intimate, romantic evening. They played electronic/club music and had neon lighting going on, which was a cool vibe but not as intimate as we thought it would be.  Drinks were fine, nothing to write home about. However, I was REALLY impressed with the food. I don't even really like potato chips, but the Charlotte \"nachos\" are a must order. It's a huge mountain of cheesy chips that is great for sharing. The fella and I also both raved over the chorizo-stuffed dates (wrapped in bacon!). Seriously divine. We also ordered the Mr. Fungi pizza, which was a really unique and delicious take on pizza, especially in a town inundated with too many pizza joints.  My biggest complaint was with the service. We checked in 45 minutes early and got a drink at the bar while we waited for our 8pm reservation. At 8:10, we finally had to go to the host stand and inquire. Magically, a table appeared right away! The host staff were not very friendly and overall it was a slower service experience.",

    "text": "First time visiting Fahrenheit which was recommended to us. It was in a hotel up on the 21st floor. They do have valet parking which cost $10 with validation. We made a reservation and just had to wait about 5 minutes for our table to be cleaned. At that time we went out on the patio/balcony which had some seating and a great view of the city buildings. Sarah and Taylor were our servers and they were awesome and accommodating to all our needs because we moved tables to fit two more people. I did not find the menu too appealing, nothing out of the ordinary of our fancy restaurant , especially when they serve pizza pies. I ordered the porkchop and my boyfriend ordered the ribeye. Everything was good and prepared well. I also ordered a salad and some ice cream haha which I loved more than my actual meal. It was definitely expensive but that was already known. Definitely a $$$ restaurant.",

The grilled cilantro jalapeno shrimp appetizer was delicious.  Our entrees were great in that the quality of food is outstanding.  We got the snapper and scallops.  They are not filling but just enough.  And you will still have room for dessert - give the caramel bourbon banana bread pudding a try as it was awesome!  The only recommendation I would make for this restaurant is to its hostess and waiters - hostesses were not very welcoming or attentive.  Our waiter was just ok, very slow (and I mean we were early and the only seated table in the restaurant)...but a restaurant like this needs staff with a little more personality, which is the only reason for my 4 stars.",

We arrived early to take in the views and grab a drink, The views were great and our bartender was witty and made pretty tasty beverages too. They were tasty but pricey.   We were seated on the backside of the restaurant with the lack luster view. We ordered off of the restaurant week menu and everything came out fast. Nothing we ordered was even decent. We didn't finish anything...salad was wilted, steak was tiny, fries were not fresh, lobster mac was frozen lobster and over cooked shells, desserts were dry and over cooked. And too boot our waitress never once asked us how things were. and an automatic 20% was add to our bill. I've eaten better food at fast food restaurants.   It's sad because there wasn't even anyone asking how things were or if we were satisfied. We will not go back.",

The hostesses were very pleasant. My friends and I had seats at the bar and life was pretty grand.   Unfortunately, the service at the bar left a lot to be desired. The bartender during our visit was aloof and too busy drinking his own beer to pay much attention to his customers. My friend ordered a sparkling rose after being led to believe that there was one on the menu, but she was presented with a cocktail, instead. It seemed like anytime we needed something, whether it was another drink or the check, we practically had to lean over the bar, even though there weren't many people there.   I'd definitely return but I'd hope that service is improved next time.",

No drink coupon just letting us know that we had to walk down the stairs from the 21st floor!

    "text": "Fahrenheit is one of the harder reservations to snag on Restaurant week.  'Regular menu' price points are high, dress is attractive, drink prices are sky high.  So at $35 for three courses, needless to say, this is one of the primo deals you want to score a Friday or Saturday night.    A-OK sums up my much anticipated visit to Fahrenheit.  We went on the last night of Restaurant Week and the kitchen did a good job promptly churning out the limited Restaurant Week menu items in pretty rapid time, they'd had 10 days to get into a routine and the menu offerings were selected for heavy volume and ease of holding and preparation, which I understand.  Fahrenheit is a beautiful restaurant on the 21st floor of the Hyatt, overlooking the Charlotte skyline.  There are some outstanding tables that overlook the fire and skyline and some tables that really disappoint (the ones next to the hostess stand when you first come in.) We were seated over by the glass enclosed kitchen and I'd add our specific table to the \"worst of\" list because we were the last table, right next to the kitchen door, which had servers scurrying in and out non-stop.    On the plus side, I got to see what was being ordered all night but the non-stop motion was annoying and honestly, it's a 4-top they should simply remove from the floor as it's awkwardly placed and I'd have quickly complained had I been paying regular menu prices.  The table of 4 that arrived after us with two teenage children was given a prime skyline view table which annoyed me as I could see we spent a lot more money then they did by the end of the night.  We waited for about 10 minutes before we met our server and he took our drink order.  He was friendlyish and took the time to recommend an off the Restaurant Week appetizer, the Ahi Poke Nachos, that sounded delicious and I'd like to try on another visit, in addition to letting us know his favorite appetizer on the RW menu was the avocado.  Water took another 10 minutes.  Delicious pretzel bread arrived well after the apps.  My husband was surprised to see they have Pisco on the menu and ordered an off-the-menu Pisco Sour, which he said was only ok.  I tried the Phoenix in Flight: Blackberry infused Pisco, Hennessy VSOP, lime juice, simple syrup, fresh blackberry, egg whites and Plum bitters, which tasted nice but came out to be a whopping $15 and I had two, oops.  Happily my husband loves me a lot. :)  Appetizers: ~Wood Grilled Avocado - Thai sweet soy, goat cheese crostini, lime, sea salt.  We received one half of an avocado filled with sweet cherry tomatoes and served with two crostini.  The sprinkle of cilantro was a nice touch. I noticed that this was a 1/2 portion of what is on the regular menu (2 halves, 3 goat cheese crostini, $9.50). ~Negi Maki Egg Rolls - American Wagyu beef, green onions, Asheville Cheddar, Katsu aioli.  I thought these would be amazing, but they were just egg rolls.  I love aioli but wasn't super fond of this sharp tasting version and even though I researched it, I couldn't figure out what Katsu aioli is (as opposed to Katsu, the deep fried breaded chicken). ~Crisp Calamari - Tega Hills farm greens, kimchi, Thai sauce.  Breading and fry are so important and this one missed the boat.  Entrees: ~Slow-Braised American Wagyu Short Ribs - teriyaki lo mein, roasted wild mushrooms, baby bok choy, apple syrup, toasted sesame.  This was the super-star of the night.  Served with chopsticks, every flavor on this dish worked together to elevate it head and shoulders above much I've tried recently.  $39 on the regular menu.  ~Maine Lobster \"Mac & Cheese\" - Cognac reduction, chives, Brie & goat cheese, oven-dried tomatoes, pipette pasta.  I was so hopeful for this.  My tablemate and I both received just 4 bites each of lobster in this dish, a friend who went earlier in the week said they had a plethora of lobster in theirs.  Had I paid the regular price of $36 I'd have been upset.  ~Grilled & Glazed Wild Caught Salmon - wasabi mashed potatoes, blood orange, Saikyo miso, sweet & sour cucumbers.  I desperately wanted to try this dish but due to the Pacific salmon warning out right now (Jan 29) I reluctantly passed.  But calling it out because it sounds fantastic and I saw plate after plate leaving the kitchen headed for tables. $25 on the regular menu.  Desserts: ~Double Fudge Brownie - caramel popcorn, chocolate sauce, chocolate tuile.  Dense, deep, dark chocolate for dense, deep, dark chocolate lovers.  Try another choice if you aren't a dense, deep, dark chocolate lover.  ~Toffee Cake - Bourbon caramel, apple compote, toffee crumble.  Toffee cake was nice, bourbon caramel was so delicious you could drink it.  A teeny, tiny little ramekin (or just a stitch more on the cake) would have been delightful.  We walked outside on the terrace after dinner to enjoy the view and while it was bitterly cold, it made us all agree to come back and have cocktails one warm pleasant evening.  Beautiful view and fires.",

The decor and menu haven't been updated since the late 90s and the smell of the dining room is a testament to that. I've seen more inspired menus in remote locations of Upstate NY than this metropolitan restaurant has to offer. While it is thoughtful of them to have one, the gluten free menu isn't even accurate!   Not only is the service slow, the server isn't educated on his menus nor does he return with answers to your questions. Dessert menus had to be asked for AFTER a birthday dessert was served and it had melted long before anyone else at the table was served.",

    "text": "Have always wanted to try Chef Rocco Whalen's food. Last night, I visited there at around 11 pm. I called ahead to ensure that they served food until 1 am.   Upon arriving, the hostess informed me that there was open seating at the bar and outside. I poked around outside and admired the fantastic view, but there didn't seem to be any servers. I went inside to the bar to ask about dinner service outside, and the bartender assured me that a server outside would take my order. Yeah, right.   I shared a long, wooden picnic table with a couple who were finishing up their drinks. Very obviously and conspicuously, I read not one but two magazines. Yet, no service. No drinks, no nothing.   The couple left, and as I finished up my second magazine, a female server meandered over to me and asked what she could bring me. I asked, \"Are you still serving food?\" She replied, \"We serve food until 1 am.\" Then, she just stood there and looked at me. I asked, \"Can I see a menu?\" She replied, \"Sure. Let me get you a menu.\" Then, she wandered off.   Having sat there for about thirty minutes with not even a drink, I became annoyed at this nonsense. As the waitress sauntered back over to me, with a menu in hand, I shook my head and told her I had been sitting there for thirty minutes without any service, and I just had to leave. Her reply: \"Oh, ok.\"  I've really been wanting to try Chef Rocco Whalen's food, but the place is a disaster. What good is the great view of Charlotte? For anyone who wants to see it, here's my tip: order a single drink from the bar and close out your bill immediately. Then, walk outside, stand at the railing, look at the view, and then go someplace else to eat. That's what I'll do from now on when I want to show someone Charlotte's impressive skyline. And, if this means I never get to taste Chef Rocco Whalen's food, then to quote his server: \"Oh, ok.\"",

One night it will be throwing a house party; Katy Perry blasting, drunk kids everywhere, selfies being taken in every corner. Another night it will throw on a suit and try to impress the girlfriend's parents; more professional crowd, subtle music flowing throughout, wine tasting/pairing events, business dinners.   It's frustrating because this place can deliver; but management is trying to run a nightclub and fine dining restaurant in the same space. Fahrenheit needs to decide what it wants to be when it grows up. Judging by the declining reviews, they need to do so quickly.   Feel like rolling the dice? Give Fahrenheit a try and cross your fingers that you end up at a place emulating Bentley's and not Suite.",

STRONGLY recommend that you ask for an UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW of uptown, especially if you're there for the first time.  It appeared that all of their 2-tops were blocked by very wide pillars, so we spent our romantic date and first time at this restaurant--which we attended specifically to enjoy their renowned view--staring at one of those lovely support pillars.  We would have asked to be reseated, but the restaurant was busy and probably wouldn't have wanted to place only 2 people at a table meant to seat 4 or more.  In general, will treat as a special occasion place for our of town guests, but won't go back as just the 2 of us.",

Sadly, the food will not bring them back -- save, maybe visits with guests from out-of-town.   Beyond the view, the only other selling point was our server. She was phenomenal. Gave great explanations of the dishes, suggested a wine pairing, and let us linger before sending out our dessert, even during restaurant week.   My mister got the chicken spring rolls, hanger steak, and cheesecake, while I got the calamari, hanger steak, and bread and butter cake. The chicken spring roll was strangely served. I was thinking it would come out like a True spring roll in rice paper or something maybe similar to an egg roll. Nope, not at all. I typically like calamari, but the pieces of squid were legit encased in rock hard breading. The hanger steak was way salty and way too saucy. The desserts were the highlights of our meal.  Overall, the food was meh. If you've even taken a cruise on a Carnival ship, I would put the quality, taste, and portion size on par with cruise food. Not the most flattering comparison, right?",

    "text": "This could be a restaurant week unique experience - but I can't give them the review I was hoping for. I used Open Table to book a group of 8 for a business dinner. I had someone with us from out of town and wanted to give them a great view of the city and a great meal.  So first, the good:  1) The bar was great, I loved the tables and the view and the atmosphere there 2)  The caramel apple martini. 3) The view (in the bar and main dining area)  Now, the reason for the MEH review:  We were not seated in the main dining room. We were put in a bland room with nothing but other large groups.  The noise became unbearable and no one could hear anything because all these large groups/parties were seated all together in a box like room with very little atmosphere and no music or ambiance.   The servers were so stressed out from R-Week that they got a bunch of our order wrong and kept bringing and dropping off items we did not order. I have no idea who didn't get the items, because they never came back for them to correct the order - we were only offered the Queen's Feast menu and had to ask several times for the regular menu - the items we ordered from that were good, but we got more of them than we ordered. I think for some reason they added one extra of each app we ordered.   Only half way through dinner did I realize on my own that there was a special wine list for R-week on the table. No one let us know this before we started ordering wine for the table - the special menu was behind some other items and not really obvious - so i was a little miffed that they didn't call our attention to the promotion when they asked us what we wanted to drink.  I was really disappointed that I didn't get to enjoy the real ambiance and menu. I wasn't happy about paying over 700.00 for a lack luster evening. I am not cheap when it comes to fine dining - but I do demand a good experience. Unfortunately, I had no idea it was R-week and wasn't going out for that reason - so it was less of a positive thing for me and my group.  I will probably try the bar sometime in the future... I did enjoy the caramel apple cocktail.",

Interior: 3.5/5,  View: 5/5,  Food: 4/5, Service: 4.5/5, Drinks: 4/5, Location: 3.5/5, Hip scale: 3.5/5.  I think it's a place everyone goes to check out the famous view like how bentley's once was. And I remember loving the view, the service, the interior at Bentley's but not so much the food. A turnoff for me because I am going there mainly to eat.  I went to Fahrenheit for a functiom. So don't take my word for it but the food they served was fantastic. The thin pizza, the pop corn shrimp, the galbi slices were awesome. Especially because the fat on the meat was still there. I love that part.  Drinks were good too. I had a few jack & cokes and a couple of glasses of wine. They were all good. Enough to make me happy after three. And the service was fantastic as well. This is something I lool at after a restaurant's food/drinks. And they passed with flying colors.  The view... Yes, the view that you see on every Charlottean's Facebook at least once. It is not overrated. In other words, it's good. I've already been to my buddy's who live there a few floors down so it wasn't new. But nevertheless a great view of the pretty, miniature-manhattan skyline.  Here's the bad news. It's not the best looking restaurant itself. The view and the building looks pretty from outside but the restaurant looks very narrow and small when you first walk in. I thinks it's mainly because the first thing you see is the large glass window with the view not so far from the entrance. Yes, that could impress some people but not me. The fine dining section was separated on the right from the bar side in the middle and the left. And that also was a bit of a disappointment for me. A place that wants to build up a name for fine dining and a trendy bar should not have a hundred thousand screens with every game that's on that night. Certainly shouldn't be one of the first things you see.  Lastly, I can't help mentioning that the building entrance is a bit unwelcoming. The desk clerk was great but I'm talking the floor plan, and the layout. The building's anchor tenant is a business hotel, and Skye condos. So the doors, and tbe entrance itself are small and narrow. It is more homelike that way. But not so welcoming if you are just going for a drink.  That's my two cents. Hope they help!",

Then we finally order, but no one checked on us to see if we were ok, or even tell us the food was on it's way. They could have at least brought some bread to the table or something to hold us over since we had been waiting for over an hour. We  FINALLY ate at 11:30 on a 9:30 reservation and there were not that many people in the restaurant.  When we asked to speak to the manager, she had a very nonchalant attitude. She was more concerned with proving that they did nothing wrong as opposed to looking for  a solution to please her customers.  Food was way overpriced to be so mediocre, and they could use better management. You are paying for a view that is not the best, but is ok.

    "text": "Beautiful view, but.... The husband & I had a little date night on Wednesday and decided to try Fahrenheit. We were surprised valet parking was not available and parked in a nearby lot for $10. The restaurant does not reserve tables yet several tables had \"reserved\" placards. We were sat 1 row away from the windows, with a wall blocking the window view. I asked to move to 1 of the 2 available 2-person tables with a view and the hostess promptly moved us. (Did I really have to ask?)  The menu is small, which isn't an issue, except they were out of what I wanted to order. I ended up getting beef Wellington dish that was so bad I had to send it back. Left a very ugly taste in my mouth. The manager had my replacement dish (crab cavatelli) in under 5 minutes. It was delicious!  Our wait staff was helpful and professional. The restaurant is VERY loud. It is pricey. With all the options up town we won't go again.",

We went on a Friday evening and it was probably one of the quieter bars in Charlotte. Quick service, lots of servers walking about.   The butler was my favorite cocktail   Defiantly worth a visit",

Lynn Allen, the GM, made a fun and exciting night even better. Not only does the restaurant offer top notch views of the city, it offers exquisite food as well as impecable service. Our napkins were folded for us any time we got up from the table by the staff. Our glasses were never empty and our waiter offered great advice when we weren't sure what to order. We could have made a night out of Farenheit alone. We have already made plans to go back. Thank you again, Lynn, for helping us to celebrate and for making a night to remeber. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!",

    "text": "This review is for the Sunday brunch. Made a reservation for 11am and arrived on time. There was only one table occupied and we were immediately taken to our seats... at the ONLY table near the windows without a view! And, trust me, the view is the ONLY reason to have brunch at this restaurant. When I asked to be moved to another table the hostess said we would have to return to the entry and \"WAIT FOR 10 MINUTES\" because she didn't want to overwhelm the server responsible for the other tables! Remember, there was only one other table occupied... all the rest were empty and no one else was in the restaurant. Absolutely horrible customer service.   As it turns out, my wife didn't want to make a fuss, so we took the original table.   We then had to wait nearly 10 minutes before anyone asked if we wanted coffee or water... maybe we were being punished for questioning our table assignment.  When we were finally served coffee and juice the coffee was room temperature and hardly drinkable. We asked for a fresh serving.   The food was very mediocre. My wife had a strawberry French toast special that was served cold and had very little evidence of egg wash. It was a sad dish. I had their regular French toast, which was also served at room temperature. It was comparable to a store bought Danish in texture and flavor.   We wound up spending over $50 (with 20% tip) for a meal that was totally unsatisfying and virtually worthless. We gave the server a good tip because he was obviously embarrassed and the food was not his fault.  I would never go back to this restaurant for brunch.",

We'd heard about the amazing views, but were (reluctantly) seated at a table right by the entry. no views to be had. i asked if there were any other options, but they said it would be a 45 min wait. ok. fine.  the bench seat is a solid 4 inches higher than the other seats at the table. awkward.   an amuse bouche was delivered. no explanation as to what it was. it was fried. it was basically a hushpuppy-- nothing bad, but \"amuse bouche\" is quite the title for a hushpuppy.  apps were decent all around. the glaze with the avocado was a lil strong, but as a whole, it was a delicious app. husband had calamari wish was good (but how can you go wrong with fried?). friend had something else...don't know what it was. he wasn't fond of it. he ate it, but was underwhelmed.  pretzel bread appeared. the butter that came with it was aaaawesooome.  i lucked out with the salmon entree. friends had short ribs that were served with chopsticks, tho i have no idea how one cuts up a chunk of cow with a chopstick. the meat was not sliced. the lobster mac and cheese was forgettable.  dessert was decent toffee cake with a too-sweet topping and a delicious apple sauce. the brownies were hard as rocks. lil hockey pucks with decent flavor, but brownies should be warm. period.   all in all, we won't be back.",

    "text": "I attended the soft opening on a Saturday night for Fahrenheit a few weeks ago.Located in Charlotte's Uptown on top of Skye Condos, this is another creation by the famous Chef Rocco Whalen.  The hostesses were very friendly, and accommodating when our reservation was delayed 45 minutes (due to people lingering and having more wine...I can't say that's a bad sign). We headed to the restaurant bar, which has a very cool hotel vibe to it. Since it was a soft opening, there weren't any specialty cocktails on the menu yet. The bartender said they were in process of creating them, so I'll definitely have to come back to check out one. The rooftop has gorgeous views of Charlotte. I can imagine this will be a trendy spot for people to linger by the elongated fireplaces on the rooftop and mingle.   Our waiter was extremely nice and apologized for the wait. He was knowledgeable of the product and answered all of our questions.To start, I had the Goat Cheese Salad which was delicious. The pistachio brittle game a little salty crunch against the cherry tapenade. For a main entree, I had the scallops. As an avid scallop lover, I have a very high standard when it comes to ordering them, and I was not disappointed. Although the scallop dish was not grand in portion, the cauliflower puree and the buttery scallops were comfort food at its finest.  My friend had the Smoked Ribeye, which is what I will be ordering next time. It was cooked to perfection and had a lot of flavor.  For dessert we split the Ghiradelli Sea Salt Cookies, which were a little to the crunchier side than my preference of a softer cookie. However, I'm never going to turn down a cookie!  Parking is tough, as it is in midtown. I would recommend cabbing or finding a parking garage within walking distance. As it was close to the Epicenter, it got a little crazy on the streets (it was CIAA weekend and the town was ready to party), but Fahrenheit was a nice getaway in the sea of madness. I can imagine it will be a refuge during the summer when the colleges are out.",

First course - Crispy Calamari which honestly the worse calamari I had in awhile. It was too fried. All I tasted was breading. I couldn't even finish it. My friend ordered wings which surprisingly good.  Second course - I ordered Teres Major Steak. I did not realize that a nice fancy restaurant like this can have a horrible steak too. It was difficult to cut it was a \"steak knife.\" When I finally able to cut a piece, it was not what I excepted. It felt like I was chewing gum. Honestly, It probably wasn't steak. I asked my server if I can switch it to the salmon - even though the sever didn't ask me how I like the salmon cooked (med-rare), it came out asap and it was good.  My friend ordered Slow-Braised Kobe Beef Short Ribs which was very tender and falling off the chopsticks when picking up. It was also good, but not amazing.  Third course - dessert!!!! Meyer Lemon & Marcona Almond Mousse was what we got. It was okay. Nothing special.  Overall, it's a perfect place for drinks after work to watch the sunset. But I would not go back for the food.",

From the twenty minute wait for drinks, to less than exciting cocktails after the wait, things started off rocky.  The cuisine wasn't for me it seems either.  With the table's meal service arriving mixed up and unsure of who ordered what plate to start then the cuisine itself not reaching the quality level expected for the price paid.    From short rib that was chewy to steaks that while cooked nicely tasted of what was perhaps a soy sauce marinade that overpowered the meats flavor, and appetizers that had the same problem,  the dining experience just didn't match the price tag (approximately $100 a person on this trip)  And to top it off.. The slow and confused service came pre-billed to our parties tab at 20%...  If you're out for a beer and looking for a great view of Charlotte, I recommend it,  otherwise I'll spend my time somewhere else.",

    "text": "I will have to try this place again when it is not restaurant week. It's sad when the best thing about the restaurant is the view of the city, it's truly amazing. I'm sure restaurant week is like the black Friday of shopping, people who would never eat here do and the bills are not as high so the regular waitstaff doesn't want to work it. I can totally understand that.   So we will start this review off with service: our waiter was sub par to say it nicely. Slow with service, and just not attentive. He even made a comment that I drink water like a fish but would never fill my water. Now I'm new to the south, it is hot and I do drink a lot of water. It's fine to comment on that but at least fill my glass. We ordered our meals and then he later came back saying that steaks can only be served medium well because it is restaurant week, I like mine mooing and my friend likes it medium rare so we changed our dish. I understand it's easier for them to do this and I have no problem with that but I would think 4 or 5 days into it the waitstaff would know. Our waiter must have put in our full meal at once because our desserts were the first thing to arrive at our table. We later found out he's usually a bartender and waiting tables is not his favorite.... really? I couldn't tell...  Food: I'm a foodie, and I'm proud of it. There was nothing I was overly thrilled with but the steak that I stole a bite off of my friends plate ;) Which came out medium rare.... I'm not saying anything was bad, it was not but I was more impressed with the flavors of cabo fish taco than I was with anything I ordered. The calimari was good, the kobi braised beef lacked flavor but the flavors of the lo mein seemed to make up for it.   Atmosphere: It does have the most amazing views of the city. It does also have views of the people getting in and out of the hotel pool next door.... which can be a little awkward to say the least. Inside it is loud, you have to yell over everyone else to hear the other people at the table. The decor was fine, but I haven't been to a fine dining with plastic table mats before.  All in all: I did have a fun girls night out but it was more on the company I was with than the service provided. Hopefully I will go back again and have to rewrite this review saying I was amazed with the regular staff, the food was to die for, and I cannot wait to go back again. Until then I'll probably just go back for cocktails and enjoy the view...",

    "text": "The experience itself was a bit disappointing...  Visited Charlotte for the first time and wanted to check out Fahrenheit because of the view and the menu looked great. I personally have worked as a server in 5 star restaurants in the past so I was expecting the service to be very good. Don't get me wrong I understand that things happen but this was just disappointing.   First off, we were seated without a drink menu. It would be one thing if we were only sitting there for a minute or so but we waited 10 minutes before even being greeted and watered. When we were offered a drink menu and finally able to order our drinks it took another 10 minutes for them to be delivered.  Second, after waiting a while for drinks we asked if there were any specials... to sum it up if you are serving dinner in a nice restaurant such as this... know your specials by heart, do not read them. When you don't know them it comes off unprofessional..   Also noted was the servers change in attitude when my boyfriend ordered they most expensive dish on the menu...  We arrived and were seated at 7:45 and my drink order was not taken care of until 8:10, that is a LONG time and we almost considered leaving. Finally the dinner order was put in at 8:22.   The rest of the evening was fine. The view here is magnificent and the dinner was fantastic. Dessert was equally as good. My boyfriend and I are not snobs but we do like and know good food and good service. The food and the view, plus the pleasant experience from other waitstaff who were not taking care of us is the reason for the 3 stars. Would consider going back with the hopes that the next time would be different/better.",

    "text": "I did not want to write a negative review but since the manager was so delightful and nice considering the staff I decided just to give a review. I do not live in Charlotte, visiting and a friend recommended this rooftop bar for a few drinks and on to the next spot. It was a Tuesday so it was a nice crowd, not overly crowded, seemed like a few groups that frequent the place for after work chat and drinks. I saw an empty area so I kindly waited to be greeted by the bar staff/mixologist. No acknowledgement and it was a little odd as I asked a patron sitting down if this was an area where someone was sitting becuz we there were four empty seats. The person sitting by said that no one was sitting down but they asked why the bar staff didn't say anything. So I just assumed maybe this the laid back pace here in Charlotte but I've been here for three days and haven't experienced this.  Even at the ritz where I'm staying no problem, so I'm assuming maybe something is going on. The bar staff literally took her time making a drink so I was thinking maybe they were playing with the drink, or learning a drink because they were seriously overly going slow. Finally the bar staff gave the drink to a customer. Still not the universal \" hey you guys, give me one moment and I'll be right with you.\" So I told my friend who does not drink alcohol that I'm going to the other side of the bar. A bar staff asked if I wanted a menu, I thanked them and asked for a drink. I was told to wait, no problem I'm just happy that I was acknowledged.  My friend on the other side told me to come back over so I did and the same bar person for some reason had a dislike to me or something odd. So the two bar staff spoke and when I asked for my order, I was beginning to let the bartender know that I told the other person I wanted a drink and after I said that the bartender stated \" yes she was getting you a drink, you just have to wait,\" I mentioned that it's no problem, she can get me a drink and the other person can make, I'm paying for the drinks so if I have more than one perfect. (In my eyes that's a win as I don't have to go back to the bar). So I ordered the $17 glass of wine, took forever to pour, my other friend wanted a Mai tai and from a patron listening the girls didn't know how to make and when my friend got it they didn't drink as they mentioned it was not good.(I got wine because you cannot mess wine up)didn't take the drink back,just ordered different drinks.  Going to the table, the manager came by and asked if we needed anything and he also introduced himself. I asked for a drink and I do wish I would've just stayed at the table and had a waitress get drinks but I wasn't aware that you could.  This is a very lengthy review and I wouldn't do this but I've traveled all over from Italy, French Polynesia, Africa, Germany, many places in the states. You never should judge a book by its cover. Always treat people the same as you never know who you will meet. I've always remember that and I treat everyone the way I would like to be treated.  The bar staff at this establishment should be aware that universally when dealing with the public you acknowledge them to let them know you see them and you'll service them when you get a chance. That was all I needed. I'm very big on that especially if you work in an environment like that. I've been to places that I wouldn't assume would have great customer service and I received A1 service which deserved a hefty tip to show appreciation. You never know who is watching so always be kind and respectful to the next.  Will I come back, no I will not, but the place does have a nice atmosphere and vibe.",

The bartenders were polite but not friendly, not engaging and didn't smile. Is that too much to ask?  The bar should be staffed with pretty people who are dynamic and engaging and crack a smile!  Aside from the automatons behind the bar, everything else was stellar.  Because the food was that good, it made up for the bar staff. I highly recommend before it get's too hot to hang on the roof top deck.",

Both dishes were fair; although the consistency of the lobster mac and cheese was not comparable to other dishes that I have eaten and thoroughly enjoyed, in the past.  The lobster, cheese and pasta in the Fahrenheit dish were not consistently blended; therefore, the cheese and pasta did not compliment the lobster.  Additionally, the level of service did not meet my or my husband's expectations of proper and formal etiquette, because our dishes were not served from the left side and the dishes were not picked-up from the right.  When the servers brought the dishes to the table, they did not know which dishes I had ordered or the ones my husband had ordered.  Finally, the most disappointing experience tonight was that the level of service was not comparable to the 20% gratuity that was automatically added to our tab.",

Our table had a nice view except for the fact that the setting sun was in my eyes for a while.  We sat for easily 20 minutes before we flagged someone down to bring us some drinks. No one acknowledged our presence. This was a Sunday for goodness sake at 7:00 for goodness sake. They weren't that busy! So drink orders placed now our server shows up. She seemed nice but not apologetic for her absence. We all got some variation of the Moscow Mule and all were good. We ordered the Carolina Nachos for the table. Everyone seemed to order them around us too. I thought they were so-so. A better pimento cheese was needed in my opinion. The biggest problem with our meal was the service. It was just not on par with $40 entrees. It was not on par with $10 entrees. It was awful and ruined the experience for all of us. The food was pretty good. My date and I split the avocado  and cucumber salad and the mushroom pizza. The salad was great but the pizza was mediocre. The service was so bad that my boyfriend finally went to speak with a manager. She must have spoke to our server but she did not have it in her to bring the server back up to par. The worst part was the manager did nothing else. She didn't even stop by the table! The meal ended with a comedy of errors with the check. The view was nice. I might go back for drinks but not going to risk it for dinner again.",

Our waiter was very friendly and came to see us soon after we were seated. We ordered our drinks and mine took a while to be made but it was worth the wait. I had the peach tea mint julep and wow. I could have drank 5 of them. We ordered the salmon and the scallops and we were both very happy with our meals. The presentation and the flavors were amazing. Things slowed down after that. It was very busy for a Monday night and our waiter was doing his best to serve all of his customers but they seemed short staffed for the amount of tables they had. We ordered the salted caramel cheesecake for dessert and it was also beautifully presented and delicious. After dinner we went on to the balcony and the view was just stunning. Over all, we were very happy with our visit and we'll definitely come back. I would have given 5 stars if the service was quicker but our waiter was amazing so this was more the fault of staffing issues.",

    "text": "My family and I made a reservation for Sunday, December 6th, for brunch to celebrate our son's birthday. Our party of 6 arrived on schedule and were seated at a very nice round table overlooking the Charlotte skyline. Our server took our beverage order and took a long time before he returned with the drinks. It was before noon so we just had coffee, juice, etc. Our party had some questions about the menu choices and the server's knowledge was somewhat lacking.  We ordered a variety of entrees which also took longer than expected. Please note we were one of three tables dining at that time.  The food did not arrive hot with the exception of the side of home fries which were very good.  My wife ordered the brioche French toast which was a BIG disappointment.  It was terrible - thick slices of brown bread with no egg wash and very dry - not anything like brioche French toast should be She had to ask for maple syrup to make it somewhat edible.  Two of us ordered Eggs Benedict Carbonara which came with pork bellies.  Canadian bacon or Virginia ham would have been a better choice and NOT fatty pork bellies!  This dish was also served lukewarm. Another person ordered waffles with chicken.  The chicken had bones which made it difficult to eat since it was on top of a waffle. For an upscale restaurant ,this should never have happened.  The jumbo pancakes came with no maple syrup either. Since we were celebrating a birthday, no one wanted to complain.  To top it off, when the food came out, several servers had no idea of who ordered what and had to call out \"Who ordered this?\" . This is very bush league for a supposedly upscale restaurant.  IHOP does a better job.  Fahrenheit needs major help - the chef needs be put on notice and the servers need to be better trained.  For $140 including tip, this was a very unpleasant and unsatisfying experience.  The location and ambiance are superb BUT the food leaves a lot to be desired.  Never again! Buyer Beware!!",

One of my biggest pet peeves at a restaurant is being rushed through my meal, especially when it's expensive.  I really enjoyed the chorizo stuffed dates and my tuna entree was delicious but humongous.  When I came back a second time with a couple who had never been, my expectations were fairly low. Let's just say my expectations were met.  I ordered the tuna entree again and it was significantly different-almost inedible. It was so coated in spice that I had to scrape it off just to eat part of it. It had no flavor other than HOT and I hated wasting such an expensive dish, but I had no choice. The drinks were weak. My friend had to order an extra shot of tequila for her margarita on the rocks. No thank you. When we got the bill, we found out that our husbands' Jameson on the rocks were $21 per glass. At most other restaurants, Jameson on the rocks is about $12.  A huge waste of money. I have no idea how this restaurant has good reviews. It's overrated and serves mediocre food at best.",

Waitress was surly from the no greeting beginning to not bringing a spoon for the soup. Had to flag down another waiter after waiting at least 10 minutes for her to return. Soup was cold and seriously over salted.   Our guest told another server that it was inedible.      No comment from server. He just took it away.  My \"Charlotte Nachos\" were cold.   Our guest's hamburger was not hot and her mashed potatoes solidified because they were so cold.   My husband had the lamb and said it was good but could have been hotter.   Another guest had the cauliflower side. She was disappointed and did not eat it.   Waitress never asked why we left our meals.   Truly unprofessional evening.  Last surprise---tip added to check.

You need to get the dates with chorizo and bacon, it was so amazing. I am a pizza hunter so we had pizza as appetizer and it was so fresh and delicious. I want to try all the pizzas! The nachos are delicious and very good to share with a big table (although you may not want to share with more than 4 people because you will want it all for you). The dishes were good although I wish I would have ordered a meat dish and not fish. I had the ahi tuna and it was not so flavorful. Everybody else had the salmon which I tried and thought was good. If you want to stay low budget and you still want the experience I would recommend to go and get appetizers and enjoy the view. I was full after all those amazing appetizers that we had but I thought it was totally worth the calories. Maybe next time I don't get any appetizers and give their meat plates a try. I cannot wait to try their Cleveland restaurant!",

The service was better than the reviews tell you, but the reservationist is snooty.  The food was better than the reviews tell you. The portions are larger than you would expect, so order carefully. The appetizers are better than the main courses. There is very little outdoor seating, it is more of a walk out take a look, maybe have a drink then go back inside and eat. Nothing wrong with that, just don't expect to eat outside. The view is of course what makes it and inside has a great view. The one thing that was surprising at the price point was the cowd. There were a couple of very drunk girls bumming cigarettes in the lobby. That was a throwback, people who smoke? The entire crowd was just a little rough, like they weren't going to leave a very big tip. It just wasn't what and who you would expect. Would I go back? Sure, the food was good, not outstanding, but way better than decent. I am not afraid of a rough crowd, but I wouldn't take a client there. All in all, better than I expected, but not as sleek and special as their hype.",
