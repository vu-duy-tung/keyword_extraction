I swear they use the crunchy tacos from a box.not authentic or tasty. The shredded chicken was lukewarm and had no flavor made my stomach feel queezy. The beans were ok and the rice was flavorless. The service was not so great. I would rather eat the Mexican food at Macs Speed shop rather than come back to this place.",

Seeing that it is in a shopping center, the restaurant has a pretty good size--they were able to accommodate my 30+ coworkers while there for a business dinner. I was not impressed by their beef or chicken impanada or their saled (the ranch did not taste like traditional ranch dressing). My chimichonga was ok, but if you are used to your chimichonga shell being soft, make sure you tell them NOT to deep fry it. The Chimichonga is a very big portion. I tasted their lime(house) margarita and was not impressed. But I also had the strawberry and a mango & pina colado swirl margarita (VERYYYY GOOD). You can ask them to mix the flavors if you like. I am not a fan of tart margarita's, so I would not recommend the house margarita but I would recommend any another flavor--mango, strawberry, etc. The Chips, salsa, and queso dip were RIGHT on the mark and did not fail me! Salsa was not to spicy and queso was sooooo good! If you go on Monday nights, they have drink specials so be sure to ask your waitress! If I was to go only for chips, salsa, queso and margaritas-- I would give them a 5 but due to their food I would have to say a 3!",

One of my friends had the fish taco that he also enjoyed. I can't recall the 3rd dish but there were no complaints until it got close to closing (11p).  We arrived at 10p. The lights come up, the music stops which is acceptable.  the server damn near wiped the table down while we are still seated and nibbling on our well prepared dishes. He started pulling plates and glasses sometimes without asking if we were finished. We didn't appreciate that. We weren't lingering and we were not the only table still seated at 11p. If the staff is not prepared to seat a party at 10p for dinner and drinks they should have bar only seating for drinks and/or appetizers only.",

    "text": "Food and service were both incredibly lackluster. We had a rather large party of 10, however we were only one of a couple tables seated, with a couple more people sitting at the bar on a Saturday afternoon. Our waiter was very nice, but he seemed incredibly overwhelmed. He was manning both the bar, and all of the tables. This was despite the fact that there were several servers working however they all seemed to be in the back of the restaurant doing busy work. The poor waiter who was helping us was given no help from his coworkers. This culminated in a rather poor thing experience.   My boyfriend and I ordered nachos from the appetizer menu with high expectations as nachos are really difficult to mess up. I've never had a nacho I didn't like. Until Salsas. While the cheese and toppings were plentiful, the chips were almost nonexistent.  At one point, we asked our waiter if he would bring more of the free chips they serve and he replied he would be right back with them. However, his attention was quickly pulled back to the bar and we never received more chips. Our nachos were only about 1/3 eaten and by then became a soggy mess. We had to throw them out.   Had anyone of the 4 or more extra servers jumped in and helped this poor waiter/bartender, perhaps our particular experience could be saved. However, to their credit, the rest of my parties meals looked good, and they seemed to leave satisfied.",

However we showed him the menu & he still refused to accommodate us.   As a paying customer, I wouldn't return to this establishment because you are expected to eat food you don't want.",

Although there was a quiet room near the entrance we came in, we were directed to a sports bar-like area in the back. The food was good, but we could hardly enjoy it with a football game being blasted near us. Not only that, but there was a different sport on the TV's all around the room. The bartender and servers seemed indifferent to the fact that only one person was watching a TV at the bar with the game on, and the rest of the room had on a different sport!  The food was good, but we would never go back to a place that did not make us feel comfortable! Not with so many other Mexican Restaurants in town.",

Salsa and chips delivered by a young lady without any greeting at all.  Waiter finally arrived to take drink orders which was too confusing for him to take an order of 2beers and one margarita.  Had to come back to ask if margarita was to be on the rocks or frozen.  Should mention he did not come back and ask that for 10 minutes.  Finally got the drinks ( never had a margarita served in a beer glass before).  Food was bland and chicken enchilada was dry. The worst part was trying to get our checks to leave.  The waiter never came to ask if we would like anything for dessert.  I had to flag down the hostess to get the check.  We ask for separate checks but got 3 checks split 3 ways.  By now we have been there 11\\2 hours and I was ready to go.  After 15 more minutes of trying to get the checks right three different times I gave up.  We were overcharged for the beers but if I had insisted on getting that corrected i probably would still be there. Can't expect this place to stay in business long.   Wish I could give them zero stars.",

They were very good and the salsa verde was delicious. My husband got the street tacos and said they were very good. I tried to order dessert, but they were out of the fried cheesecake, so I skipped it. They did offer to make fresh coffee. The prices weren't terrible, but for the so-so taste it was overpriced.

We will not be going back anytime soon.  The service was very slow and communicating with our waiter was next to impossible.  My husband ordered steak fajitas and the meat was chewy and had a strong flavor.  As for the veggies, it was mostly tomatoes.  He loves onions and there were only 5 slivers of onion on the whole plate. They weren't busy, so that wasn't the issue.   Very disappointing but live and learn.",

The chips are thin and crispy, the salsa is a little runny, but overall was good (disclaimer I was starving when I got there so that probably helped).  The chicken fajitas were average. The skillet did come out sizzling, which was a very positive start. With that said, there was a ton of onions to peppers ratio on the skillet (I am more of a peppers person), but it could have just been my skillet. The chicken was also average, some pieces were a little rubbery and I felt that it could have used a bit more flavor/spices.  No a huge fan of the guac that came with the fajitas. It did not taste right, I'm not sure what exactly was off, but just a heads up if you plan to order that as an app.",

I was too hungry to care, so I ordered the martini on special and a water. The drinks returned in a timely fashion, so all was fair (again) in my book.  I ordered a chicken burrito and it was huge! \"Oh no, stomach don't fail me now\" huge!   I was delicious and I managed to eat 97% of it before throwing in the fork.

I mainly go here for the movie theater, but it seems like there are a lot more places opening up that would keep me hanging around longer. PSH and the Beer Temple are good adds and there seems to be something for everyone.  Salsas has been here for a while, but I think there's probably a good reason why I haven't made it in for a while.  Everything was okay... I was a little skeptical because a couple of previous yelp reviews/photos made the place sound worse off, but I'd say it's a solid 3.  Walking in, the hostess wanted us to sit at the bar, but there was some confusion and we wanted a booth.  Unfortunately there was large table of 20 people that lined up along the booths so it was a little awkward to get in... and I'm sure the server would have preferred us to be at the bar instead.  Whatever... I guess maybe don't push all the tables together to block off the booths?  As a result of the tables, you could tell the server was having a hard time going in and out and checking in on us.  I was left with an empty water glass for half the meal.    Had it be any other day, I'm sure the service would have been fine.  The food was nothing to write home about, but it was a decent portioned dinner.  Probably priced a little higher than a typical tex-mex place, but I guess it's the Ayrsley area.",

We've actually stopped going to Don Pedro's when we want Mexican as we've had more inconsistent experiences there and it's very loud. Our most recent visit at Salsas we sat in a booth near a large table of after work folks who were apparently IT/Enterprise Architects for a local firm. They were a bit loud discussing business, which, since I work with EA Directors, I leave work to get away from such convo, but not Salas's fault - maybe sit couples away from larger tables/ppl with small kids when not crowded. Also, sometimes the table set up (as in this large party) make it difficult to move in the dining room/get to the door.  All in all, we really like Salsas and will continue visiting fairly often.",

Place wasn't busy AT ALL literally 2 other couples and 2 people at the bar. They place us in a small both and add a small table to it. We had a total  of 3 seafood fajitas and NONE OF THEM CAME OUT SIZZLING. All of our food was either room temperature or cold.

Worst communication I've ever experienced and I am a former restaurant owner. In a price value evaluation,  I believe quality of food and service were poor and inferior to other similar establishments.

I was starving so I ordered the Fiesta Platter which comes with a chicken and steak quesadilla, chicken flauntas and grilled shrimp on top.   Yep...all that. I said I was starving!   The quesadilla was a bit different. Instead of the meat and cheese being cooked inside the tortilla, it  came out topped with the cheese and meat over lettuce. It was pretty good. I wish they wouldn't put it over lettuce though, it made some parts a bit soggy. But that's a minor issue, because overall the dish was very tasty. I was also really pleased with the portion size. The shrimp were cooked perfectly. And they had just the right amount of seasoning. Delish! My only issue was the flauntas they were a bit blah....not enough favor for my liking. But still overall this was a really good dish! I'd definitely order it again.   But still this is a pretty good spot to get your Mexican fix!",

Though not crowded I love the Arysley neighborhood for it's beauty and calmness. Having trusted the restaurant here would be as good as they look we decided to pitch inside.  Don't get misled by the bright neon lights and pub like appearance from outside. Entering inside the pub I was disappointed by the tiny little tables and chairs. My friend and I are regular adults at about 160lb but trust me the chairs were too small for our rear. The place seemed over packed with lot many tables than it could hold.  We were offered chips and salsa in a tiny little bowl - the chips weren't crispy and were pathetic. We didn't even touch it. I ordered an Enchilada and it came on a smaller plate than I expected. The taste was just bland with some white gooey stuff which they call cheese. That's when I decided never to return here again.   This is one of the few Mexican restaurants where I got out as hungry as I got in. Barely filled my stomach. Unless you want to go to Alice's wonderland where every thing is super tiny and minuscule, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",

It seems that it couldn't decide between being a night spot or a Mexican Cafe. Glitter balls on the ceiling of one half of the room, more of an al fresco dining area on the other. There is an outdoor area for dining. Which is very nice.  We had kids with us, so we ordered a kids app platter, my husband had the Tequila burrito, and I had shrimp tacos Mexicanos. Kids platter was all fried, not the best option but hey we are on vacation.   My tacos were sloppy and bland. Really bland. I guess that is what I get for ordering something off the menu.    Hubby's Tequila Burrito was cheesy and very spicy. It was delicious and made me jealous. Would recommend getting a specialty.   Drinks and service were great, but food was 50/50.",

I ordered the fish tacos which I had to add salt , cheese and salsa just for them to taste like something . The rice was really good, a bit salty. The best part was the frozen house margarita . Now that was delicious . My friends enjoyed the queso which had ground pork in it. The chips and salsa was ok.  My friends order the chicken and shrimp fajitas. I can't comment as I didn't try it.   Once again our bartender was nice but the food was a miss for me.",

We swung down to Ayrsley Towns and initially were going to go to Wild Wing Cafe and spotted Salsa's while we were walking through the shops. Immediate change of plans, time for some Mexican.   There was a nice patio out back however we thought it was little to hot to be sitting in the sun and decided to eat inside. It was already a little after 2pm when we arrived and the dining room was empty except for one table. That worked to our advantage, the service was prompt.   I ordered the Burrito Machaca which is filled with beans, shredded marinated beef and cooked with scrambled eggs and covered with queso. My friend ordered the Pollo Hausteco. This dish came with a  marinated chicken breast topped with a layer of barbecue sauce, queso and a slice of pineapple. Sides were the same with both meals, which included  Mexican rice, beans, lettuce and sour cream.  While we both enjoyed our lunch I found it kind of plain. I'm not saying it's bad by any means, just that there was no zest to it per say which my buddy also agreed on his lunch.   All in all a decent lunch and we did have good service.  I'd certainly visit again.",

They offer a lunch menu, and there were plenty of good options on there. The food was served quickly and was piping hot!   I went with the enchilada and tostada express lunch, and express was certainly the word. It was out super fast, but everything was fresh. I loved their refried beans...which is such a simple side, but easy to mess up. All their meals came with free chips and salsa, and their salsa was very fresh, and not spicy. I would certainly order it again if I was in the area.",

The chimichanga was fried nicely and I loved the jalapenos in it. However, I really think that this place is over priced. For my chimichanga and rice it was $13 or so dollars. I think that there are many other mexican restaurants with the same quality of food where you get the combination platter and everything and are only paying $7 or 8 dollars. The service was great, but I can save some money and get the same type of food if not better somewhere else.",

Needless to say, I've watched this town transform into what it is today. My roommates and I would come here often, today the meals are a little pricey. Out of all the restaurants that have come and gone, Salas's Mexican Grille has continued to stand strong.  Personally, I love the Jalapeno Margarita! Here are a few of my favorite meals:   If you're a seafood Fan, I would recommend trying the \"Seafood Fajitas\". This dish is served with fresh scallops, grilled tilapia, and jumbo shrimp. Talk about sizzling perfection! This dish can easily feed three people.   The Steak Quesadillas are really good and filling. You also get a side of lettuce, sour cream and pico de gallo.  Dessert anyone? Try the Fried Ice Cream you won't be disappointed! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.",

Parking.Let's talk about it. Trying to find this place today i actually rode past it twice,there's a parking deck in the back which it took me a minute to figure that out.Far as the looks of the inside of this place nothing to talk about just a plain older setting the hi lite of this place was the disco ball i spotted in the top of the ceiling.Was a little pricey compared to other small mexican joints for i only had a margarita and empandands and paid $25.Not bad just pricey for what i had.Might re visit this place tonight just to try a different flavor margarita since i loved mines so much ,this place won me over with their margarita.",

I am not Irish at least I do not think so, that may have been why the luck of the Irish let me down on this one.Here is the run down location Ayrsley  Town Blvd area a busy area with a mix of restaurants, a movie theater, A sports bar that I have already reviewed   and was terrible. This is a  prime location  and any restaurant  owner would give their first born for this space.And their second born for that matter.             As you may have read I am a Chips and Salsa person I make my own chips and salsa of many kinds so if you got chips, Salsa and beverages you got me . More about that later. As I walk in you pass threw  a pretty nice little bar area  with only 2 people? In this busy location? What gives I thought?             So we make our way past the decor that any Mexican restaurant has I notice I guess maybe 5 maybe more very large  flat screen TVs so now you have a bar and Tvs  Ok sports bar ?The place was pretty clean and a patio outside in the back that I though when the weather gets cooler would be packed or should be..             We get our chips and salsa Ok with the name of Salsa's you better bring it.!!  There is something about  using certain names of the food that you have in a restaurant that tells the customer \" with that name surely its good/\"I know your still waiting on the chips and Salsa report  we will get to it a moment .              I have to give it  to them they make a mean Mango Daiquiri but, it took forever considering there was only 6 people in the whole place and 4 of them where finishing  .And I normally do not ask about the price  but, the menu that I am looking at does not even have them listed nor the price I felt that very strange for a Mexican restaurant  at  such a good location (again) Why not have it on the menu?                I had the El Presidente a combo platter withTostada,taco,Chile Relleno and my other  wanted Carne Asada typical  Mexican restaurant chain restaurant food big  cold plates and heated up in Broiler just so so taste and not much  authenticity .Oh ya back to the chips and Salsa chips stale over heated I hope what I have heard is wrong that the chips are reheated off of someone else s plate that's terrible. And the salsa watered down no flavor . Just a FYI I had some chips that I had made the Day before and I tasted some of mine and the \"Fresh\" ones we just got home with... Theirs where terrible !! Come on no excuses 6 people in the place it takes me about 1 minute to make enough chips to feed 4 . Maybe a Taco Bell would do better at \" this\" location?",

The prices may seem a bit high compared to other local Mexican restaurants; however, a lot of Mexican restaurants in the area have greasy or over cooked food.  Not here!  I don't think we've had one bad meal in the entire 3 years we've frequented this restaurant.  We've recommended it to so many friends and family and will continue to visit this great local establishment.",

The service was out of sight, with dozens of staff members filling our glasses and keeping our buffet filled with delicious food. The fajitas were great, and the guacamole was especially delicious.  Everything was fresh and perfectly prepared, which is hard to do for a buffet style dinner.  The atmosphere was fun and friendly, with a spacious dining area separate from the bar  and a really cool outdoor patio. Best of all was the service, which was friendly, attentive, and prompt.  We had a pre-arranged price given how big our group was, so there wasn't any specific incentive for the restaurant to be so nice to us.  They just seemed to take pride in their service and their business, which is rare and admirable these days.  My only regret is that we didn't have a chance to sample their great beer list or try one of the monster margaritas that looked absolutely mouth-watering!  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.  This is a grade-A business.  Two thumbs way up.  Thank you Salsa's!",

The waiter seemed upset I was not ordering a mixed drink, I was just looking at the menu to see what they had for future visits.  The food, taco salad was okay...then I waited and waited and waited about 25 minutes for my bill, which was not brought by the person who originally waited on me, I asked for a tea in a to-go cup, the girl said unsweet, I said no sweet, she said okay, unsweet, they brought the bill, which I already had the money out for and left it. Then brought tea, I asked was it sweet, she said unsweet, I told her I had asked for sweet, they finally took the money for the bill, and then the original waiter finally came back and asked did I need the bill.  I heard this girl laughing and telling someone at the station that I kept changing my mind back and forth, no I ordered sweet tea from the beginning.  If you are going to laugh at customers and complain, you should not do it three feet away from them.",

    "text": "This review has been a long time due for Salsa's. This place has great salsas (as it should!) and drink specials all week long. The service is quick and impeccable as they are very attuned to your requests.   The last time we came here we had literally 30-40 minutes to order, eat and get to our movie. They know my husband and I so well that we don't even have to ask for the various salsas or even drinks!   They have recently revamped their menu and have added many different dishes aside from their usual fare. There are many different vegetarian options as well that are very good. The side of vegetables that accompany many of the dishes are cooked to perfection with the right amount of seasoning. The portions are rather large and can even be split between 2 people.    My only qualm would be their house margarita - I do not care for the pre-mixed drinks that are more sour mix than tequila so I steer clear of that. Other than that, great choice for any meal, even an impromptu quick weekday dinner.",
