I kinda doubt I'd go back for a full on meal because the place looks a little run down but if you are in the mood to watch football, eat peanuts and tie one on. You are in the right spot. Also, it seems to be more of a country bar type location so if you are in to that check them out on one of the nights they have a band playing. The servers are also very friendly and prompt about taking your orders.",

    "text": "We like to go to this Boardwalk Billy's over in the Matthews area on Fridays or Saturdays after a long work week.  It's a nice, casual place to go as a couple or with kids and just hang out.  One of my favorite things is the salted peanuts in the shell waiting for me when I get seated.  YUM.  What a fantastic appetizer.  I try not to think about anybody's hands other than my own touching them before they were placed on the tables.    I'm a sucker for spicy stuff, so I always go for the Buffalo Chicken Wrap or Buffalo Chicken Salad, both with Super Hot or Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Both are good, nothing unique about them or probably any menu items at Boardwalk Billy's, but they're reasonably priced, taste good, and we enjoy the laid back atmosphere.  There's usually some beer on special any night we visit, so I like to wash down the spice with a cold brewski.    The only downside to BB is the smoking.  People smoke at the bar and it wafts over to the tables.  Even if you're sitting outside, you can't escape the smoke from the tables surrounding you.  But, hey, it's a bar.  I mostly expect that.  We get out of Boardwalk Billy's relatively cheap and with full stomachs.  The kids enjoy the (one) free arcade game, so that gives us a breather to enjoy the beer(s) a little longer...",

If you are looking for a casual place to sit and drink with friends or family this is a great spot.  They have a good beer selection and a pretty basic menu.  I don't recommend the crab cakes, as the ones I had were burned and tasted like I was eating crab flavored bread.  But their salads are great and the oysters are pretty solid according to my husband.  The staff is a little slack, when we were there there was a waitress (not serving us thankfully) that was sitting with some customers and smoking with them, which I find to be disgusting and incredible unprofessional.  Not sure where the manager was to manage that.  But it is a lively casual place and a good spot overall for just that, casual dining.",

There was nothing inherently wrong with the food except maybe the slaw having too much of a vinegar taste to it.  Fried shrimp, steampot, and fish tacos were all par.  They don't have too much craft beer on tap except for Fat Tire, but that's better than nothing.  We may go again if in the area, but also may not make a special trip to go.",

I've been let down the past 2 visits to this place. The service has gone downhill, and I've noticed there have been considerably fewer patrons there. They've also changed some of their menu without actually reflecting it on the menu. For example--they got rid of the awesome shoestring fries. Sad day!

I got the coconut shrimp, which, while plentiful at 10 shrimp served, they were small and over cooked.  The mac and cheese was super bland and dry. My husband got the shrimp tacos and I tried one and it was only ok. Nothing special at all and had 3 small shrimp.  My son had a burger, fries and chicken fingers. I tried the chicken and it was slightly better than ok, maybe a 3 out of 5.  The patio could be nice but with all the smokers right around the corner by the front door, you'd never know the patio is non-smoking until 10p.  It was quite Smokey at times when the front door crowd was puffing away.  Im thankful for non-smoking restaurants but having to walk thru it to get to the front door, then smell it during a non-smoking patio dinner leaves me wondering why they permit smoking right at the front door. As mentioned, our waitress was the highlight of our visit as she was very pleasant and patient with my son who took his time determining his order. Won't be back and don't recommend.",

He puts my beer down and says \"name!\".  I tell him I'm just going to settle and try to hand him my credit card and he says \"I don't give a f*** if you don't want to open a tab!\"  Just moved around the corner from this place and thought I found a cool spot.

My husband ordered the BFF (Burger Fingers and Fries), this was our first time ordering this item and figured as the name suggests we would get those three items. When we placed the order online, we selected coleslaw as a side believing that it was in addition to the fries. However, when my Husband called to inquire about not receiving fries, Mary was quite rude. Instead of using this opportunity to explain the menu, she decided to scold/blame my Husband for selecting coleslaw. Maybe BFS (burger, fingers, and side) would be a better suited name to limit confusion. Keeping your tone of voice professional would have made all of the difference.We love to support local businesses, so we'll give this place another shot. Hopefully Mary was just having an off moment and isn't normally so snappy with customers.",

It wasn't bad, it was \"meh\"-- we we're very hungry from our flight so they had a chance at vulnerable people who would like anything, unfortunately the burgers were very dry and over cooked, the fries were probably the best thing on the plate. I should have ordered the wings in hindsight. The service was good, on point and attentive, that was the strong suit--the burgers seemed like they were sitting under heat lamps for a long time. If you need to catch a game, drink some beers and get some wings--this is your spot. However, if you're in search for a tasty burger, look somewhere else.",

For some reason, the ribs just sounded good but having been a transplant from Memphis and a bit of a BBQ snob, I was hesitant, but went for it. I ordered mine with sauce on the side. Let me just say that these could rival ribs anywhere! They didn't need the sauce -- absolutely delicious and they were moist tender, and fell away easily from the bone. I enjoyed the sides of fried green tomatoes and slaw as well. My husband said his smoked chicken was good as well, but I think he preferred my ribs. He said our son's smoked wings were also smoked and delicious. We will be back!",

We were seated on the patio which was great -- it was shaded and there are fans so we could enjoy the beautiful weather without sweating for the entire meal.   Our waitress was very attentive, checking in regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. I ordered a tropical tangerine punch bucket which is a great size and comes in a cute Bacardi bucket. Although it was super tasty, I don't think there was that much alcohol in it. I'm not a complete lightweight, but for a drink that supposedly has six shots I would expect to somewhat feel the slightest bit tipsy. I didn't.   We started with the \"world famous\" crab con queso dip. I will start off my saying that I do not like seafood but enjoyed this dip. I might have eaten around most of the crab chunks though. But it was pretty tasty. My meal was mediocre. I had the mango BBQ chicken sandwich. I don't know if I would order the particular sandwich again but would gladly try other items on my menu. My boyfriend ordered the steam pot and he seemed pleased. It's no beachfront restaurant seafood but definitely filled that seafood void between trips to the beach.   Overall, loved the atmosphere of Boardwalk Billy's. We will definitely be back for drinks and appetizers with friends.",

Our service was good, maybe a little slow, but good.  The menu is a good size.  The husband got buffalo wings but the sauce was not hot so they brought him some hot sauce and after that he loved them.  I ordered a fish and chips platter and it was RIDICULOUSLY HUGE!!!  It was also YUMMY!  Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was upbeat.  I could see us going back if we were in the area.",

They came with spicy sauce which was somewhat tangy, and not my favorite, but the ranch on the wings was pretty good. The one thing I did not appreciate was being charged extra for ranch on the side and not knowing this charge until after I got the bill. I usually like when servers tell us this ahead of time.  I thought the hush puppies were done perfectly. Really crispy on the outside and soft texture in the inside. The Cole slaw had a bit too much of a vinegar  flavor for my taste, but not bad. We also had some orange mimosas which I would recommend, very yummy.   Atmosphere was clean and inviting, staff were very friendly and responsive.",

    "text": "I have tried reaching out to management 3 times about this incident with no reply. Not even a, \"thanks, we will look into this.\"   I have been to the establishment many times by myself, and never had an issue. I usually come on the music trivia night, and have encouraged my boyfriend and friends to come so they can learn more about american music and be around people who are not Brazilian, they are shy and say no.     Last week, my boyfriend, James (29) and I, Emily (26)  just got off of work. We went to this establishment around 11PM on 5/8/2019 (Wednesday). My boyfriend is Brazilian and knows very little English, as he speaks Portuguese. He does know Enlgish though, but people have to talk very slow so he can understand and respond. My boyfriend and I decided to go to to Billy Boardwalk and have a drink to celebrate my birthday today because I am off to travels for a few weeks. This was the last time we would see each other for a while. We were immediately greeted by a male server, I would say in his 30s, with brown/blonde hair. He spoke to my boyfriend.  I always try and encourage my boyfriend to respond because he is shy and I would like him to try his English more, so I have him a couple of seconds to see if he would reply. My boyfriend did not feel comfortable to respond so I replied. I asked for water and said we would need a couple of minutes. Me addressing the waiter instead of my boyfriend seemed to disturb the waiter. I always give my boyfriend the opportunity to speak when we go out, sometimes he does, and sometimes he does not. It really depends on his comfort level and if he can understand the person. The waiter mumbled a lot and was quiet, so my boyfriend could not understand him. I think the language issue is implied because James looks foreign. Me talking to the server really seemed to catch him off guard. I cannot assume his personal philosophy he has for why he would expect to talk to my boyfriend instead me.  In the preceding ten minutes, the waiter walked over three times in our direction, which was the long way to the bar or the area to gather food. I assumed every time he walked our way he was going to take our order, he did not. Every time he walked by he brushed my boyfriend with his elbow. James was sitting on the outside of the booth. This rubbed me the wrong way, as the waiter had plenty of space and him touching my boyfriend was weird and unprofessional to me. This was not once, and can be chalked up to an accident, this happened three times. This was not a crowded place again, their was only one other table in the common area taken.  My boyfriend and I were not trying to pay attention, as we were just focused on each others company, and again, we had just gotten off work and wanted to celebrate with a beer or two.  The waiter after ten minutes came back. I ordered a Frozen Daiquiri and ordered a Corona for my boyfriend. The waiter mumbled and I would not understand him. He told me he could not serve us because he felt my boyfriend was too intoxicated.  I spoke one sentence to him since entering asking to bring us water while we reviewed the menus and from this he somehow got my boyfriend was intoxicated. I explained to him that my boyfriend spoke very little English. If he had asked for our ID's, which he did not, he would have seen the Brazilian Passport my boyfriend carries around. The waiter kept mumbling and I could not understand him. I was embarrassed because this has never happened. This coupled with the brushing up against my boyfriend, I got up and told my boyfriend we would go somewhere else to celebrate.  I really like this establishment, I do not know if I would come back, and I do not think I would being my Brazilian boyfriend or any of his friends. I understand the right to refuse, as I have worked in the food industry, though I am astonished at him being refused because of his lack of English skills. I find this very culturally insensitive to entire groups of people. The waiter could have engaged us any sort of conversation to try and confirm his suspicions, if he thought we or he was intoxicated.  Did you go anywhere else tonight? Are you both from the area? What brings you out tonight?  Nothing, just \"your boyfriend didn't respond to me when I mumbled a greeting, you did, so he must be drunk.\"  I understand things happen, maybe this waiter had a long day, needs more training, or quite frankly just is not too smart. I could barely understand him and had to ask him several times to repeat himself because he seemed timid and was mumbling. That combined with him continuously brushing up against my boyfriend just was completely a turn off for this establishment.  I am very surprised I have come here many times and had great experiences, the one time I bring a foreigner we are refused service. Whole situation leaves a bad taste to me regarding this place.",

My waiter was a really nice man named Jamison (I hope I spelled it right) and he was great. The food was good, but the reason I'll be coming back is because of him. He was on point not only with making sure my drink was refilled but helped me make some great food decisions for my lunch today. It is moderately busy and he was great at keeping up with everyone. We need more people like him around. One of the things that really gets to me when I sit down somewhere is when my drink is empty and I never get checked on and he was on top of it, not to much where I felt like he was bugging me but just the right amount.   The food was good as well the cost compared to what I got was pretty good. The blackened chicken tacos and Mac and cheese were great.   Kudos to this place",

    "text": "The location is hidden in the back of a shopping center your GPS won't pick it up so keep your eyes open. When I got out of the car I was greeted by a regular that was outside smoking and she was super nice. I then went into the restaurant and sat myself. I took a look around and the first thing I saw was a large board with a NEW BEER selection which was a decent amount of draft/bottled beer of all types.   The menus is pretty diverse from seafood, wings, sandwiches, and more. I ordered a founders porter (beer) which was $4 not a bad rate and the Party platter($25) of seafood. The food was good but no vet much seasoning on it and not enough to fill you up. If your hungry either upgrade or don't get the Party platter. I then ordered the smoked chicken wings and they were amazing!   The service was really good, beer was ice cold, specials daily, and if you like to talk to regulars sit by the bar.",

    "text": "Love this place - great locations, very good food and a great variety to suit everyone's taste.  Great beer selection and lots of free peanuts!!  I've been here a couple times, most recently April 28 - Prom Night for some.  I was told there was a 90 minute wait for a table, but found a seat at the bar.  Within 30 minutes we were seated outside on the deck which is really nice at sundown.  I tentatively tried the BBQ, but was very surprised at how well this non-BBQ place pulled it off.  Would definitely go back for more.  Really fun and energetic staff, place is not a romantic setting - little noisy, but fun to hang around in and enjoy a good meal.",

    "text": "This is a good option if you are in the Matthews area and are looking for some good eats and cold drinks. The beer and cocktails are a flowing all day long. After inhaling a pack of cigarettes as you enter the front door... You are seated by a hostess then greeted by a free pail of peanuts. A little something for you to chew on as you browse the large menu.  I don't think I have had anything bad on the menu at all! Anything with jerk chicken is tasty as well as their house made Reuben! Don't forget to ask for your fries to be done extra crispy with sriracha powder.. You can thank me later. I've been lucky enough to learn about a secret menu item - pork rinds! Ask for them to be done in the sriracha powder also... Woo!  It's a good place to watch a sporting event, there are several boob tubes placed all around the restaurant. They also offer live music on Sundays which is fun and team trivia on Thursday. A calendar of daily specials will keep you coming back...  I've never seen Billy. Or a boardwalk.",

That being said, it is not bad, just nothing spectacular.    The service is hit or miss.  Sometimes it can be decent.  There is never a wait to be seated, which is always a plus, anywhere you go!  The atmosphere is open and friendly.    I have only eaten the oysters and they are good!  Never had any complaints about them.  They have oysters available all year round, so if you're craving them, it's nice to know you have a spot to come.  It is very casual environment.",
