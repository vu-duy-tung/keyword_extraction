The first time ever being there was my first time having poke. I was so excited to try it but I wasn't familiar with the other toppings. The two guys stood behind the counter not even greeting me or saying anything to offer any help. LITERALLY NO HELP, I felt so awkward and just ordered something off the list. The other two times I've been were with the same 2 guys. Not sure if they're the owners but they're not friendly at all. Kind of stuck up. I only go here because it's convenient to go to, but I prefer to-go because I don't want to see them.",

If you are new to \"Poke\", it's Korean/Hawaiian just FYI; because you should automatically know that, right?? . Ordered two \"build your own\" bowls totaling $25 and some change including tax. However, they do have a discount/punch card for frequent flyers in which your 11th bowl is free. While I did not at all enjoy the seaweed salad (one of the 3 toppings I chose), or the bean sprouts atop my bowl, after picking those both off.....it was ok. The seaweed salad and sprouts tasted a bit....canned? Definitely something skunky there, that wasn't right. However, my boyfriend's bowl was pretty good. They have crushed flaming hot Cheetos as a topping offering....yes, Cheetos. It's actually pretty good. Soooo, all in all I would give it another try and make my bowl a bit differently opting for more fresh toppings. I think it's worth trying if you are looking for something that is quick and different. Especially if you live in the area. It's better than eating Chipotle everyday for lunch .",

The quality of the ingredients was A1. The staff were super nice and helpful.

You could tell they knew their stuff and were pleased with the product. We went with the King Wicked Tuna, Seoul Poke Special (with added crab salad), spam musubi (interesting!), passionfruit lemonade (sooo good!) and lychee lemonade that we were told was a new, fresh batch. The food came out quickly and tables were small 2 tops - perfect. Also, staff came around and cleaned the dining room a few times (the space was impeccably clean).  The food was excellent, fresh & piled high (I was full when I left but it looked like I hadn't taken a bite).  Self-serve drink fountains next to the door was a nice touch, the different shades of juices almost looked like art pieces in the white space. And you'll keep topping off your drink because this stuff is amazing! Flaming hot Cheetos as a topping in one of the bowls was a fun touch. This is the furthest poke restaurant for me to get to but I'll be back (or cross my fingers that it'll show up on Postmates!). Extremely pleased with every aspect of this place.",

    "text": "**Pro tip, follow them on social media. They try different concepts and offer them to the public on a first come, first serve basis. On Monday they tried out a Korean short rib bowl. It was Ono!**       I've been to SPB for lunch about three times now and they haven't disappointed. As soon as you walk in, you'll notice that the decor is very clean and modern. The tables can fill up fast but I usually take my bowl to go anyways. Every time my coworkers and I come in the staff of SPB are very friendly and will give you suggestions if your not sure what to get to fit your palette. Since Poke is getting popular here in Charlotte, its nice to have a place to go to with familiar flavors to me. The veggies and the marinade for a lot of the proteins have a very Korean flavor. It works nicely together in the poke bowl since local Hawaiian food is melting pot of a lot of different Asian cultures anyway. It really does reminds me of back home. The fish is fresh and since I like my bowls spicy I always get jalapenos and the Korean gochujjang sauce. But you can always try out the different sauces they offer to find what fits you.       But honestly, in my opinion the star of their menu so far is the spam musubi. I know what you're thinking, \"spam?!? What the f...\" the thing you have to understand is spam is a stable of Hawaiian food and culture for decades now. Growing up I was never a fan of spam on its own, which is weird because I'm a Korean American who grew up in Hawaii, and those two cultures love spam! But I can eat musubi all day. The musubi has a blanket of tamago (egg) rice with furikake sprinkled in, Spam (of course) maybe in a shoyu dressing(?) wrapped in seaweed. All individually wrapped so you can eat on the go.. people will just look at you weird because your eating something that looks like a spam sushi, but if this was Hawaii, the locals would might ask where you got it because everyone has their favorite place to get musubi.      All in all, if you're a fan of fresh fish, crisp veggies and want it all in a convenient to go bowl, stop by Seoul Poke Bowl. Try the spam musubi and follow them on social media so you don't miss out on their special bowl creations before it goes public. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

Like many restaurants that serve great food, you have to get there early. We got to Seoul Poke Bowl just a half-hour after they opened on a weekend. Most tables were taken, as you would expect. Seoul Poke Bowl has a wide variety of items from which you can custom make your own bowl, or there are some suggested menu items as well that you can choose. I was impressed that they had so many varieties of fish, including yellowtail.   Quality of the food was outstanding. You can taste the freshness! Quantity is plentiful, although at first look it seemed it wasn't the case. That is, they use a medium size bowl, but it is packed with food, and even piled high. I talked with one of the guy behind the counter a bit (the owner?) who knew a lot about where they get their fish and how long they've been open, etc. They get the same fish from the same company that sells to the high-end restaurants in the area. They've only been open a few months, too. Prices are about $2 higher than other places I've been, but it is completely worth it. I rather pay a nominal amount more to get fresh food and feel \"full\". So, you will get your money's worth here. You cannot go wrong! I can't wait to go back!!",

I LOVED my custom made, subway selection style poke bowl. I love poke! This place is set up like a Subway sandwich shop. Plastic to go containers, to go condiments by the front door. Walk to the back of the store, tell them what you want, add this and that, pay (lots of money). Simple enough. The food is fresh, I was hoping it would be - old raw fish is not my style. But it's fresh! And delicious! The sprouts were drowned in water, and looked soggy, so just take a glance at what you're ordering before they throw it in your beautiful bowl.   Price. It's steeper than I like. And I appreciate, and happily pay for fresh food. But this is P-R-I-C-E-Y. My custom bowl was $16, doesn't look like you could get out of there with a bowl less than $13. So, choose wisely. And just assume that everything is extra. On a positive note, I was full for the rest of the afternoon. But I felt poorer for it...  But enjoy it while you eat it! If they were cheaper, I'd be here all the time. So maybe it's good for my wallet? Come here on payday, or to celebrate something.   Also, how do you pronounce \"poke\"? I've always said \"poke-ay\"... Hmmm.   And, if you're wondering. I'm not number 6 in line at TWC. Another review it is!!",

I was pleasantly surprised  to see Seoul and Hi Tide and the rest roll into town.  I stopped by SPB around 6:00pm on a weeknight.  Things were mildly busy with all the tables being taken by the time we left.  Service was friendly, if not somewhat awkward.  The individual scooping the tuna into my bowl apparently scooped too much in the bowl and ended up scooping some out.  I also like my poke bowls somewhat simple (I'm a shoyu guy) and I got a surprising number of remarks from the staff about the lack of toppings in my bowl.  Onto the food.  It was good.  The standout was the spam musubi which apparently is a regular part of the menu now.  The selection of beverages was pretty stellar as well (lillikoi lemonade anyone??).  The poke bowl was okay.  They don't toss your fish in sauce, so it ends up going on top, which is disappointing and the amount of fish was on the light side.  But it was good.  I'll probably be back for the spam musubi and the lemonade, but I'll check out the poke options at our other poke joints (How great is it that we have multiple poke joints??).",

It's weird to me that other poke restaurants I've been to don't add furikake to the rice (at no additional cost)... it makes SUCH a flavor difference! I also enjoy that Seoul has interesting specials like spam musubi and chicken katsu. The mango green tea is also SUPER good! I'm always satisfied with a full belly walking out of this place. The location is a little funky and the service is just alright, but those factors won't deter me from coming here often. It's clear that the owners are proud of this place - with the high quality of their product, it shows!  Tip: If you're stumped on sauces, I recommend the unagi (eel) sauce - equally savory and sweet!",

The bowl was mixed with fresh salmon and crab but the wasabi aioli  sauce made the dish perfect. The 1st time I dined in the staff was extremely friendly. The restaurant was clean everything was fresh and over all it was a great experience. This last time I had take out and the food looked just as fresh and delicious as it was when I dined in. They had a new item  musubi on the menu which i also ordered.  I must say that is the 1st time I ever had it and it was delicious. It was a large role of rice mixed with seaweed warm with sweet egg and Spam wrapped in seaweed and it was delicious. I believe they are the only place in Charlotte that has that. I will definitely be back!",

The 1st time suffering from a long day at the office the hustle & bustle & busyness was a little off putting in such a small space.   Taking it home was it was the perfect bite even the spicy Cheetos were a welcome surprise on the King Tuna bowl.  2nd time a little less busy which for me was a breath of fresh air - I didn't feel rushed to make a decision which maybe that would've helped since my choice this time was not quite what I expected - the Surf & Turf Bowl.  It was like bay shrimp & white meat chicken.  User error - not what I was expecting.  I'm not a fan of either.  Thought it would be beautiful big shrimp like duh inch close enough to look in the case.  Still enjoyable not as good as the Wicked King Tuna bowl :)   Love the variety of options & some of the quirks like the spicy Cheetos!  Can't wait for the next time I'm in the area to hit up Seoul & try another one of the standard offerings.",

The place is clean, vibrant, friendly staff and great concept. I just wish the food was better executed for the price. My seaweed wrap had way too much rice and would have held up better with some kind of wax paper wrapped around it instead of placed in a bowl. My husbands bulgogi doesn't even look like it has meat since it's buried under carrots. Overall, if I've never had poke- I'd probably love this place.

Anyway, the Wicked Tuna was good but the tuna seemed like it was cut with a borderline dull knife, some pieces were still attached to each other- and not uniform in shape. Honor the fish, man. Ponzu sauce on the bowl isn't a bad move but nothing sticks to the fish so it all drowns on the bottom leaving the bland tuna.  The amount of hot Cheetos that is sprinkled on this thing is mad disrespectful. I'm talking maybe a teaspoon or two, bro. You can't tell me hot Cheetos are expensive, you just can't. More would've definitely added elevated texture and pleasant crunch/heat/flavor throughout the bowl.   The yellow Korean daikon was a power move and very fucking good addition, seaweed salad is too. Can't complain about the white onion and scallions either.  I've got no problem with the portion size. It is pricey but I will just end up coming less frequently so I don't spend a fortune here. Instead of spending $15 here every day.   The fountain drinks here have an aftertaste of tap water/garden hose water, yo.   Anyway, bring ya mama here. Bring ya aunty here.",

As my boyfriend put it, if the bowls were $8 or $9, they'd be a really sweet deal. But, at minimum $11, the quality just isn't there to justify that price.  I built my own bowl with tuna and shrimp. The salmon was multicolored and the yellowtail looked suspect, which was disappointing because those are two of my favorite raw fishes. The non-meat toppings and sauces were all pretty good, but I wasn't blown away with the flavor of my bowl. The best component of the bowl was the brown rice - it was made really, really well.  I should have expected lower-quality fish and seafood from a fast food poke joint, but I really had my hopes higher. The bowl was very filling, which was nice, but I'm definitely not dying to go back and eat here again.",

I was greeted and helped immediately. The station where all the food was looked very clean for 8p and all the food looked very fresh. For $10.95 you can choose a base, two proteins, 4 toppings, dry toppings, and whatever sauce you like. I went for tuna and spicy crab with avocado (which is a premium topping so it's $1.50 more), cucumber, carrots, and onions. Added on some dried nori and eel sauce. Once you mix it all up to get all the favors together in one bite it's so good. Next time I want to try one of their signature bowls!",

The customer service we received was great, the young lady who helped us was very knowledgeable and friendly. The ONLY reason I am giving 4-stars instead of 5 is because their shrimp are not cleaned.

It was a little overwhelming at first because there are lots of options and I wanted to make sure I got the right combination of flavors. I ordered a create-your-own bowl and it was very delicious and my mom did the same. What I liked about this is just how different my bowl was from my mom's. Mine was sweet and tangy with mango and eel sauce and hers was more earthy flavors with bean sprouts and cilantro. It was fun, different and delicious! I would also say that I liked it almost a little bit more when I had my leftovers the next day. It allowed the flavors to soak and mix in a little bit more, which gave the dish some nice dimension.  Now do keep in mind, its slightly on the pricey side, as I was kind of expecting for a trendy new restaurant. Because of the price, I won't be going every day or every week but I definitely plan to go back. It was a nice little treat and was a perfect meal on a hot Carolina day.",

Seoul offers a unique Korean twist to the standard poke bowl.  I ordered one of their suggested bowls and it was enough food for two meals for a very reasonable price!  And you should give the Spam musubi a try.  Not a fan of spam, but this traditional Hawaiian dish was tasty!",

A friend and I decided to give Seoul a try after all the hype and were both left underwhelmed. The prices are high for the amount of actual fish received in the dish and everything felt.. mushy? I got food poisoning almost immediately after and my friend threw away half her dish. I usually do like to give establishments some time to adjust after opening, but after the food poisoning, I don't think I want to risk it.",

How much plastic garbage do they generate per day? The image of this ginormous plastic garbage patch floating in the ocean just doesn't sit well with the fish chunks in my bowl (note to myself: I should probably quit eating fish if I truly care about marine life).  One of the signature bowls is the classic Bibimbap bowl. It's traditionally served in a stone bowl which retains heat better than a regular bowl. I have had it in regular bowls too but serving it in a plastic bowl is just wrong. Did I mention the bowl is very undersized? You can't mix everything up without spilling all over the place since the bowl is so small.   When you build your own bowl, the least expensive option is $10.95 for 2 proteins with base and toppings. I don't have a big appetite so 2 proteins (or double portions of 1 protein) is more than I really want. It would be great if a one protein option for less than 10 bucks is offered.",

Places similar to this in California were somehow less expensive.

Like many others ahead of me in line, I chose to go the Build Your Own Bowl route with 2 proteins. I was pleased with the generous scoops I received and the quality of the ingredients. I selected wonton chips as my base and as an added bonus they had just been replenished and were fresh out of the fryer! Try not to go overboard with the toppings as anything over 4 comes with a 0.50 up-charge (no biggie). The homemade sauces are an absolute MUST! Get them on the side or directly on your bowl but try them all!! The night of my visit they had a new mango chili sauce which packed a small kick but complemented my spicy tuna and salmon bowl well. From my experience I am sure Seoul Poke Bowl will have great success and I hope there are more locations to come!",

It was WORTH THE WAIT! Exceeded my expectations of poke bowls. I was in Colorado, Vegas, Northern California, and I was intrigued with what's so trendy out west, they always gets the best things first out west, but I think Seoul poke bowl might be charlottes winner. Every other Poke bowl out west is basically a dissembled sushi roll. It's basically rice and raw fish lol doesn't sound too appealing right? Right? But Seoul Poke Bowl CHANGED THE GAME, and set the bar high, they took a gamble by infusing KOREAN FLAVORS into a Hawaiian style dish with some of the BEST JAPANESE/Korean flavored sauces to finish these bowls off. That's why they really Stand out to me. And I'm taking the time out to write long review. I'm truly in love and addicted with everything this place has to offer. Starting with the Hawaiian musubis that's like a spam and egg nigiri  sooooo freaking magical the combination of flavors in every bite!   Build your own bowls which I normally do for lunch time when I'm in a hurry, they get me trough the line in under 5 mins and the place is always packed, yet still SUPER FAST and I normally choose a signature bowl like their Korean bagulgi ... uhhh how ever you spell that lol got great beef flavors and it's topped with a sunny side up egg the combination is simply perfect. And drinks. They do not offer ANY SODAS NONE NOT ONE SINGLE SODA nope. Bet you think it's a bad thing right? It's the best thing EVER they make these great flavor teas that's super original and ALOT healthy yet still super delicious. My favorite is the passion fruit lemonade, and I mix it with mint green tea, kinda. Create my own refreshment",

The restaurant was very clean and the staff were friendly. The menu was easy to read and all of the food is laid out so you can see it as your bowl being prepared. They also have a variety of drinks. I recommend the cucumber mint water.   We arrived at around 6:45pm and there was hardly anyone there. This place is truly a hidden gem.",

    "text": "Finally bit the bullet and decided to give this whole 'poke' concept a try. I'm glad I waited because the restaurant was able to give me excellent quality food & service (i.e. work out any new business kinks), but I'm also so made that I've waited this long to experience the goodness that is a Poke bowl.   Being a novice, I decided it was best to select from one of their pre-created menu items. Knowing me, my BYO-bowl would have turned into a hodge-podge of awfulness.  I opted for the 'Ohana Sake' signature bowl over white rice, and it was cray cray in the best way. Salmon, Spicy Crab, Scallions, Masago, Dried Onion, Kim Chi, Avocado & Cucumber served with a homemade sweet wasabi aioli. They let you mix it up a bit if you want to substitute, so I got the citrus ponzu sauces on the bowl and asked for the wasabi on the sauce. The bowl was an absolute home run. And that wasabi sauce? Ask for extra, because it needs to go on all the foods.   My perfect bowl would be the Ohana Sake, but with mango or pineapple in lieu of the kim chi. That, mixed with the sweetness of the wasabi sauce & ponzu is going to create the trifecta perfecta.   The owner (I think?) came around and actually gave us free wonton chips & wasabi aioli sauce. Not sure if this is a regular thing or he was feeling generous, but it was thoughtful and a nice addition to the meal. Will definitely be back!",

The Lady and I walked in about 30 minutes before closing, but the two guys behind the counter greeted us happily. I wouldn't be as cheerful as them if somebody walked in my front door 30 minutes before my bedtime, so props to them.   I immediately saw the sign for the Spam Musubi (google it) and ordered it. Spam is something I had in my childhood that I don't have very often, so when I get it, it's kinda special. They made one fresh for me - customer service at it's best! Served piping hot, it was excellent. Brings back good memories. For my main meal, I got the King Wicked Tuna, and The Lady ordered the Ohana Sake. The flavor profiles were very different, mine was more on the tart side and hers tasted more like sushi rolls. Both were excellent and VERY filling with absolutely quality ingredients. I was surprised when I heard the total, but at about $13/bowl plus the Musubi, it's one of the pricier but definitely quality options. We took our bowls to go and ate it at home and were surprised at just how much food there was. Excellent! We'll of course be back. Why wouldn't we? There's a lot more to try!",

    "text": "I finally decided to go check out Seoul Poke Bowl last week for the first time. I ordered a custom bowl add avocado and one musubi. My bowl was brown rice, spicy tuna, salmon, edamame, masago, scallions, mango, avocado, eel sauce, and a small bit of sweet wasabi aioli.  Pros: -Plenty of parking -Portion was huge. Super full before I even finished. -The musubi was absolutely fantastic. I don't even like spam but I decided to order it based on the raving reviews. So glad I did. Basically its rice, spam, egg, and seasoning. So good! -Everything was super fresh and tasty!  Cons: -Confusing ordering system- I walked in and immediately felt intimidated because the ordering system is weird. There isn't alot of info on choices. There was a small list to the side of sauces, but I had no clue what these sauces were. I feel like there needs to be just a better way to guide people through the line. I was the only one there and I felt super rushed by the staff. Fortunately, it worked out for me cause everything tasted great.  -Price. $16 without a drink for lunch is steep. I wish they had a smaller bowl size, which was cheaper, as I really didn't need that much food. $1.50 extra for avocado isn't too bad but I didn't think the amount of avocado I got justified the addition.   Overall, I think Seoul Poke Bowl is going to make a great addition to our neck of the woods. The food was super delish and filling!",

I've been to at least 5 others in the area and this one takes the cake. Best poke I've ever had in the Charlotte area, period. At this point I've gone so many times that Jada remembers my order perfectly and we laugh and joke about how I'm not willing to try anything else (but I know I should because I switched it up twice and definitely loved both different bowls!! I just have a personal favorite now, but the options are so endless, you CAN'T go wrong!). I'm about to head to Seoul Poke bowl right now and I had to stop and write a review because I crave it every single day and will never go to another poke bowl in the area because it's just nowhere near as good as this place. The environment, people, ingredients: everything about this place gets 5 stars from me.   Just wanted to add that Jada has the best customer service ever and I appreciate her attention to detail and just overall kindness whenever I go in.  Ps, get yourself a punchcard when you go (because I didn't know this was a thing until Jada mentioned it, but if you like poke you should absolutely have one because you'll be back anyway and it's free and obviously rewarding!!)",

The restaurant itself has a nice aesthetic -- bright, airy, and modern. At first I thought it was a chain because the branding looked so good, but after talking with the owner, I learned that it isn't (yet) but that he hopes to expand eventually. Cool -- we could use more poke around Charlotte!  The staff were super friendly and helpful. My parents are new to poke bowls and the staff helped them through the process, patiently explaining the various toppings and even letting them sample sauces and toppings they were curious about.   They have a good variety of options to customize your poke bowl, with proteins such as fresh fish, bulgogi, and tofu and unique toppings such as kimchi, wasabi peas, and flaming hot cheetos. The sauces are great as well, my favorite being the Seoul Soyu sauce -- so much umami flavor. The prices are reasonable, especially considering how much food you get. One bowl with 2 proteins was PLENTY of food for me.   Ultimately, the Korean flair is what really sets this poke place apart from other places I've been. I've had a lot of great poke in California, but this place is just as good. Such a great restaurant that adds more diversity the Charlotte food scene!",

I went to Seoul Poke Bowl for the first time after hearing about them on one of the many CLT food IG pages that I follow(I don't remember the exact one). It looked delicious and I had never had a poke  bowl before so I added this spot to my to-do list. When I got there it was a lot smaller than I'd expected- only about 3 or 4 tables- but *shrugs* I didn't plan on eating there anyway...  I got in line with the intention of creating my own bowl, but I saw a menu of their specialty bowls so I decided to try out their Ohana Sake bowl because it sounded like everything I would've put in my own bowl. The guy that was making my bowl asked if I wanted to try one of the Musubi rolls that they were trying out for the menu and I said sure because, who doesn't love spam, right?  My total was about $18 which was more than I planned on spending but i was in the good spirit of having new experiences so I tried not to cringe TOO hard...  On the way home, I was starving so I tried the musubi and let me tell you....I almost turned the car around to go buy about 5 more and if I wasn't pressed for time (and my waistline) I probably would have. The salt from the spam was balanced with the egg and the rice so it wasn't salty at all. It was warm, beautifully seasoned and only lasted about 3 hungry ass bites.  As for the bowl...  Once I mixed everything up, every ingredient complimented the other beautifully- the raw salmon with the Kim chi, the spicy crab and avocado, the cucumber with the hints of onion, all tied together with the sweet wasabi sauce was pretty much the highlight of my day. I only got through half of the bowl but I finished the second half for dinner and it was even better the second time.   All in all, I will definitely have to bring my sushi-loving self back Seoul Poke Bowl because they have made me and my stomach very happy. Next time I'll try my hand at creating my own.",

In essence, it's a build your own bowl concept, but Asian fusion (you can also get Hawaiian Poke).  Of course I love any restaurant where I can choose every single component of my dish.  Some highlights of this place:  1.  Multiple fresh vegetable toppings. At other restaurants like this that I have been to, there may be three or four vegetable selections... This one must've had 10 fruit and vegetable selections, including fresh mango!  2.  Your bowl comes with two proteins, not one. I chose tofu and chicken. It was not busy, and when the guy noticed I did not really like the look of the tofu, he offered to flash fry it for me on the spot.  3.  I like that there were choices beyond Asian sauces. I find a lot of them to be too salty, and the citrus vinaigrette that they offered was just perfect for me.  4.  Once I finished eating, one of the employees came to my table and removed the tray. A nice touch for a quick service place.  I look forward to returning the next time I am on business travel in Charlotte!",

The idea is something I have been wanting someone to break into!   It's simple build your own bowl or select one of the preset creations. You can select 2 or 3 proteins then you get 4 toppings included. Avocado is an extra $1.50 but that ok in my book! The staff was so friendly. They let us try multiple sauces. Everything tasted super fresh and delicious.   The one lone reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I do think that your toppings should include a free crunch... I don't think this should be counted in the 4 toppings. I also don't think scallions/sesame seeds should be considered a topping... it should be complimentary.   The pricing overall isn't bad for the portions. They don't offer any mainstream sodas but they do have lots of juices/teas.   The manager came out and gave us some chips and sauce to try which is a great way to keep people coming back. I'll def be returning but I do hope they end up adding the free crunch!",

And the wrap was very messy/difficult to eat; I really wish I had just gotten it as a bowl. If you're already nearby, it's a good \"quick lunch\" option, but nothing I would go out of my way for next time.",

    "text": "I hope none of you eat at Seoul Poke Bowl because I just had the most awful customer service of my entire LIFE. I Ordered through DoorDash, got my order and realized that a few ingredients were missing. Called them, they specifically told me they put them in there... I said Well I can send you a picture because it's not in here. They had me send a picture of my food to them.. called them again and they told me they would remake it but that my total would be different aka.. they would be charging me extra. When I already paid extra for the ingredients I chose. I argued that and they finally just said \"okay we will remake it\" I had to call the doordash driver to ask her if she would kindly pick it up for me since I'm at work and she agreed. Hour goes by and I still haven't heard anything. Call them back and they said that he \"saw\" the order and he recalls the ingredients being in there. I said \"I sent you a picture showing it wasn't in there. \" he proceeded to tell me that he is not going to remake my order. I asked to speak to a manager and they wouldn't let me speak to one. And I also explained that someone already agreed to make it again for me... did they call me to tell me that they \"changed their mind\"? No. Did they even apologize? Not even once.   This was my first time ordering from them and it will certainly be my last. I'm honestly appalled at the way this man spoke to me on the phone and how disrespectful he was.  I want to know what restaurant service REFUSES to remake someone's order when it was wrong in the first place? didn't even get an apology for the inconvenience.   They claimed that they put mango and seaweed salad in my poke wrap but you tell me... does it look like they did?",

He was super nice and helpful with my ordering! I got the ohana saki bowl. The bowl came with a side of their homemade creamy wasabi sauce, which definately made the dish! The bowl was good, but nothing spectacular. Again the sauce and the extra side of spicy mayo I got made the dish better. I would go back to try another bowl or the sushi wrap! Side note, parking appeared to not be a problem as the parking lot is as empty, but rather large.",

Worth every dollar.   When you walk in, the menu is super easy to understand for novices and experts alike. You can do one of their signature bowls or do a make-your-own. I personally like doing my own thing. You pick your base (rice or even salad if you're low carb). Pick a protein (they have non-fish options), and four veggies (generous portions) and pick a sauce! It's just that simple. By the end, you have a packed bowl of yumminess. They have a great variety of toppings so good luck making your choice!  If you're a first timer, just pick one of their signature bowls. You really can't go wrong. They have a ton of drink and cold tea options, too! Also from the time I walked in to the time I left, it was a Ne-Yo party on the radio, which was completely cool. There may or may not have been some singing under my breath.",

    "text": "At Seoul Poke Bowl, I had one of the signature bowls, the Seoul Poke Special. This came with a variety of seafood including salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. It also came with scallions, seaweed salad, cucumber, mango, Masago, edamame, avocado, and ponzu sauce. The fish tasted very fresh, and I really enjoyed the seaweed salad and mango especially.   Keep in mind if you get this bowl, it will come VERY full. I had to ask for an extra bowl in order to be able to separate and mix the ingredients with the rice. While this bowl was tasty, I ended up preferring the salmon and tuna and had a lot of yellowtail left over. Having so much fish was rather overpowering so I think next time I will just make my own bowl to my own preferences. But if you're not sure about what ingredients you like, or what combinations taste good together, going with a pre-chosen signature bowl will help you figure out what you like.   Overall I really enjoyed my experience at Seoul Poke Bowl. The staff was very helpful as well and were happy to chat about the store's progress and their menu. If you're in Charlotte and looking for a good poke restaurant, definitely drop by!",

The food is amazingly fresh and they have a vast amount of toppings. I always build my own and change up the variations; love the fresh mango, shrimp, and the spicy crab. It's greatly priced for the amount of food you receive - you can't beat it!  My only feedback would be is to have the shrimp marinated to add more flavor but overall a great place and hope they open more locations. Also, the staff is very accommodating and pleasant each trip.  You're able to get in and out for about an hour for lunch so it's very convenient. It's nice they have a frequent customer punch card and after the first visit they emailed me a 10% off to use on the next visit! I will be back soon.",

    "text": "You shouldn't go to Chipotle expecting authentic Mexican food like you get in Mexico. So you shouldn't come to this place and expect  authentic Poke bowls that you find in Hawaii. (Something I should have told myself prior to coming here.)  So what do you get for $10.99, a variety of quality fresh ingredients.  Customized bowls - Choose 4 veggies, 2 proteins and choice of sauce.  Think, the Chipotle of Poke.   With that said, it was too hard for me not to get my hopes up as much as I love Poke. Which ultimately lead to my disappointment.  The sauce just didn't cover the way it does when the fish is actually marinated in it. But you cant do that and have a ton of different options and customizations. The 4 veggies were half the dish and not typical in a Poke bowl in Hawaii. The kim chee was great I just didn't want it with my Poke.  My favorite Poke Place in Hawaii offers bowls at  just $8.99 so paying $2 more for vegetables I didn't care for doesn't really appeal to me.  I will say that the Spam Musubi was better than any I had in Hawaii. I mean I don't really love spam and their flavored rice made it much more appealing to me.   While high expectations were not met, I would go back just with different expectations.  Though with all the Poke places popping up, I am still hoping one gets a little closer to the authentic experience.",

They don't skimp on the account they give you either. I was a little sad they limit you on number of toppings because there are so many good options. While I wasn't a fan of the upcharge for avocado, that tends to be pretty standard these days. The mango and edamame were great topping choices. I didn't realize the crunchy toppings counted as toppings as well but they let me try the spicy Cheetos without charging me. All of their drinks are very good at well. The passion fruit lemonade and the cucumber Mony water were my favorites. The sauces were very good. Of the ones I tried I liked the wasabi aoli and the citrus ponzu the best.   The staff was all incredibly friendly and welcoming. I will be coming back here all the time. The food was so good and I was so excited to eat it that I forgot to take a picture!",

I appreciated being able to choose two different proteins with their standard build-your-own bowl and getting the sauce on the side. Clean, efficient, and easy parking, this place will be even more popular as the apartments and town homes spread further down South Blvd to get closer to the brewery district begrudgingly referenced as LoSo (Olde Meck, Sugar Creek, etc).

    "text": "Considering it's Poke, the price is definitely justifiable. I think when it comes to fresh fish and you don't live next to the ocean, it should be a little pricey. You wouldn't want to eat cheap sushi right? I mean, I guess you could if it's all cooked, but if it's raw I would think that's a pretty ballsy move. Seoul Poke Bowl definitely gives a different take on traditional poke that's served in Hawaii (not that I know from personal experience, but from what I've had it's pretty simplistic).   Poke is pretty much if Chipotle style of fast food had a baby with sushi. Now add in a mix of Korean, and that's Seoul Poke Bowl. They have wider varieties depending on what you want. If you don't feel so hot about their default bowls, then make one yourself! I promise, it's pretty hard to pick incorrect stuff that won't go well together. I think every option gives a unique flavor and depth to your poke bowl.   I got the Seoul Poke Special, and it was pretty good. I just wish there were more proteins. I was thinking of building my own, but with that decision my bowl would've been easily $20 as I would've loaded the crap out of it. So rather doing that, I just went with their signature bowl. It was tasty, and they load you up on the fish and if you get it with rice, you'll for sure have enough to eat. I ate it with base of salad (you can choose your base if you choose signature as well!) and it filled me up for the rest of the day until dinner.  I would definitely recommend people to come here for poke, and it was about time that Charlotte got a spot for it. I'm waiting for more spots to open up. Also! They have Pokeritos as well, which are poke burritos. It's definitely something to check out if you've never had one before.  Last thing: It's not a 5 star because the avocados were a little old. Nothing wrong with the taste, I still ate all of it, but the color was a little discolored and it was a honest mistake. Seoul Poke Bowl needs to know how many people come in before they get everything right. Definitely still a recommendation if you're looking for something light and new!",

As you can figure out from the name, this poke place has a Korean spin on it. So there are some Korean ingredients that you might not expect if you had traditional poke in mind.   There are preset signature poke bowl options. Just know you can't do substitutions. You can also build your own bowls with 2 or 3 proteins. If you like a lot of different toppings it can get expensive quickly. Whether that it worth it, that's up to your taste.",

I also love their sauce options, particularly the Seoul Soy. The reason they're getting 4 stars instead of 5 is consistency. Depending on who's behind the counter, the size of the protein scoop varies greatly. The avocado is sometimes brown, sometimes not. The cucumber is sometimes marinated in a yummy vinegar sauce, sometimes not. The spicy crab is sometimes SUPER spicy, sometimes not. The fish is sometimes cut into even cube slices, sometimes not. This last time the salmon was way too big and cut incorrectly as I had quite a few chewy pieces...this is not a normal occurrence or I wouldn't be regularly coming back. I have steered away from the tuna as it tended to have more chewy pieces than the salmon. Overall, it's pretty delicious, they just need to work on consistency and making sure they're cutting the fish properly. Always greeted with a smile!",

I've been told the chicken they use isn't very flavorful (although I haven't tried it myself), but three different bowls I tried were all quite tasty (all were fish).  Overall, the bowls are a good size and filling fot the price.    The Seoul Poke Bowl may carry the highest price tag on their menu, but the flavor combination is uber tasty.  It's a great balance of sweet, salty, and creamy.  I particularly love the seaweed salad and the mango on it.  I've also gotten the King Wcked Tuna bowl and that one is good as well.  I particularly like the pickled daikon on this bowl - it adds a nice tangy crunch to this bowl.  If none of the specialty bowls are appealing, it's easy to build your own bowl as well.  I like that you get some premium options to add and it doesn't take away from the regular ingredients you can choose from (the premium is in addition to those selections).  On all of the bowls, I've been impressed at the quantity of fish that comes on it and the quality is decent as well.  The downside is that the inside is small and does not have a lot of tables.  We have just taken ours to go every time.  The location is clean and the employees are helpful with making a selection.  Seoul is my go-to for poke in the QC.",

I quickly fell in love with the dish and have been craving it ever since.  I am in luck that this place popped up near my house.  Must say that they are a little on the pricey side. I opted for the 2 protein and it was 10.95.  They call it build your own and it is less expensive than their signature bowls at like 13+. So I asked for spicy tuna and yellowtail. Later noticed they gave me salmon instead of the spicy  tuna. No biggie because it was still good and my girlfriend shared her tuna with me.   The toppings in my opinion are ok. You can have up to 4.  I went with cilantro,  daikon radish,  kimchi, and bean sprouts. They were all good but in my opinion lower the price and keep it simple with the protein and rice. The sauces were not bad. I went with the shoyu and also was able to try the ponzu that my gf got.    Now for the close and the main reason I will be back. And I definitely will be back to get the spam  musibi. They are 2.95 but completely worth it. The rice even has the furikake in it.  That was the bomb and highly recommend trying one and you will not be disappointed. Great snack !   All in all I had a pleasant experijnce and happy to have this spot nearby  Mahalo",

The staff is really friendly and can explain how the poke bowl creation works.   I recommend creating your own bowl.  You get to add two proteins for 10.95, 4 toppings, a crunchy topping, and sauce.    I did a mix of white rice and salad, two servings of spicy tuna, edamame, pineapple, masago, jalapenos, and a side wasabi aioli.  This bowl was incredible.  Everything tasted so fresh.   I will definitely be back again.  I really want to try the Spicy Cheetos for my topping next time   I ordered my bowl to go, but the inside was very clean.",

As someone on a keto diet, the customizable options that Poke offers makes it super easy to have a relatively carb-free and guilt-free meal.  Today, I started with a salad base, added tuna and salmon, cucumber and cilantro and then the spicy mayo with a light dusting of sesame seeds. It was delicious! Fresh tasting and with a nice zing to it, this was almost completely on my program.  The restaurant is clean and the young man who put my bowl together was quick and efficient. Yum!

The bowl was a nice snack size - I do wish it was a bit bigger, wasn't entirely full after!  Went back and got the Miso Soup (which was very good!)  Went around dinner time and luckily a table opened up after I ordered - so be prepared to take your bowl to go if you go.",

Perfect place to stop and grab a bite to go, or to sit and enjoy your meal. Again, perfect place to quickly pick something up on your lunch break.   Three different bedding choices; mixed spring greens, brown rice, or white rice. Several delicious proteins options, and many toppings. Their Spam Musubi was my favorite. Not a big fan of spam, but I enjoyed my musubi very much!  Serviced worked quickly to get ordered out. It is a build it yourself concept, unless you're choosing an option from the specialty menu.

Thanks to a recent office re-location, my job is in a new 'hood and I was excited to find out this place is a little less than 10 minutes away.  I visited on a quiet weekday afternoon and was not immediately greeted, even though there were two people behind the counter and there was no line. I decided to go with the create-your-own bowl. Thanks to having read other yelp reviews, I discovered that there is a FOUR INGREDIENT limit (more than four and you pay per ingredient) so I decided on my list before going in so I wouldn't go ridiculously over.  I went with the spicy tuna and crab as my proteins with brown rice as my base. For the toppings, I went with scallions, carrots, edamame, and cucumber, topped with wonton strips and gochujang sauce. I will note that the wonton strips do not hold their crunch if you decide to save some for late. Therefore, ask for those on the side, if you're not inclined to eat the whole bowl in one sitting.  My total was $11.85 (with tax). For less, you can get unlimited toppings at King Fish Poke in the University area.",

I also had seaweed salad, corn, bean sprouts, and edamame. Everything was delicious, and they had the perfect sauces to top off my bowl.

The fish is super fresh and melts in your mouth. Probably one of the best poke bowl places I've been to! My go to is the BYO bowl with two proteins- salmon and spicy tuna. I top it with edamame, scallions, cucumber, cilantro, pineapple (or mango) and sesame seeds - plus topped with the sweet wasabi aioli. Oh my!!!! The sweet wasabi is a must!!! The flavors mesh so well together!  They also have about 7 premade options but I've learned it's cheaper to BYO - especially if you want to substitute or add anything to your bowl. However the tuna bowl with hot Cheetos is the way to go. Sounds super strange but actually really good!!!   Oh and if it wasn't good enough already they have fried avocados stuffed with spicy crab as a side! My husband and I always order them then I put my half in my bowl. Dynamite!!!!!  Do yourself a favor and get here now!",

I found this poke bowl place.  The strip mall looks nice and clean. The restaurant was also modern and clean, almost sterile looking.  There's ice and water and some drinks on the right side and then you order your poke bowl like subway. I got the 2 protein burrito style and I got a soft shell crab to go. It was $32 for both.   For the two protein I picked spicy tuna and yellowtail. I got the spicy mayo on the side. I admit this got a little messy in the end but it was still good. However I thought the serving was tiny.  Also the rice was bland. I wish they would have seasoned it with rice vinegar. Overall, service was great.  Avocado is $1.50 extra There's also spicy crushed Cheetos you can add",

    "text": "After our honeymoon in Hawaii, I have been on the hunt for the best poke bowl in Charlotte. This might be it!!!! I went with the build your own bowl with brown rice, spicy tuna, salmon, edamame, masago, green onion, mango, seaweed salad, and wonton strips. My husband got the King Wicked Tuna. We both loved our bowls, as well as the side gyoza that we shared. The items were fresh. The bowls had a great ratio of ingredients.   My only complaint is that they upcharge everything. Seaweed salad  +$1.50. Two sauces with your bowl +.50. Want to substitute jalapenos for radishes in your signature bowl? They don't do substitutions and told me that I'd have to pay $.50 to switch them. In the end, the meal ended up being more expensive than I anticipated and I believe that a lot of that is due to the various uncharges. That was kinda irritating but the product was so good that I still am giving them all five stars.",

I was going to complain that $10.50 is pricey, but after I started eating, I realized there was actually quite a lot of fish. Instead, a smaller two protein bowl for a cheaper price would be ideal for me.  2. Zucchini noodle base!",

    "text": "Great poke, lots of other choices and prices are right in line with other poke spots in the Charlotte area.  Would say it was very close to a 5 star experience, but the guy behind the counter seemed to get a little frustrated with us, when there were sooooo many choices on toppings.  Me, my mom and my lady friend stopped in here before heading to an event at Triple C brewing.  It was before 6pm, so that might explain why we were the only people there.  They had some suggested combinations that looked intriguing I went with sushi rice and 3 proteins including tuna, salmon and spicy crab.  As per the other toppings, I was quite curious about crushed spicy cheetos, but not curious enough to actually order them, lol.  I did choose mango, kimchi and cucumber then topped with a little nori and ginger.  All fresh tasting and all complimented the fish well.  I suggest going for that 3rd protein as I don't know if 2 would have been quite enough to fill me.  We also ordered some steam buns that were good, but not life changing.  As per the mention of customer service, maybe this guy just doesn't like people?  I was pretty quick with choosing my toppings, but he seemed to get annoyed with my questions and small hesitations.  I wouldn't have thought much of it, but he did the same to my GF and to the next people that came in afterwards.  I guess he would just prefer people order the named combos?  Won't stop me from coming back though if ever in the area.",

It's a super casual atmosphere similar to a Chipotle style ordering restaurant. I also noticed several people picking up orders to take home.  Poke bowls are awesome! You can go low carb, but high protein and still get lots of flavor. I had a surf n' turf bowl over greens which had shrimp and chicken with pineapple, scallions, avocado, and some sauces. Delicious! I tried their special spam sushi roll (a homemade delicacy), but it wasn't for me. All of the food was fresh and authentic. We were served quickly and at around $11-13, the price was right.",

We were on the Southside of south end checking out some countertops and came by this up and coming strip center to try it. It was busy but not crowded at lunch. I went with the King Wicked Poke Bowl with tuna, avacado, brown rice and healthy stuff plus crushed crunchy Cheetos on top. The bowl was packed and plenty of food for lunch. Wife got the Soy bowl with Tofu and it was yummy as well. It worked out to be about $30 for the two of us for lunch which isn't cheap but considering the quality it was worth the splurge. Looking forward to more Poke time.",

I've lived in both Chicago & L.A. so I can get a little picky when it comes to Asian food. In my opinion, Seoul Poke Bowl is my number one pick so far. I've been to a few in Charlotte, and I think Seoul Poke Bowl gives you the most protein without dumping a whole bunch of rice in your bowl. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey...and they charge $1.50 for avocado. I get that avocado is expensive, but even standard $6 sushi rolls come with avocado so I personally don't think there should be a charge for it. Otherwise, I made my own poke bowl & I loved it! My husband had the king wicked tuna bowl & he loved it! Definitely will be back!",

    "text": "First visit for lunch.  Place is bright and clean (it is new) and menu is clearly displayed with granular description of items right behind the ordering counter.  The system is like other semi-fast-food restaurants where you order over a counter, they prep the food in front of you, and you pay at the end.  We did not wait at all for our food.  The servings were ok in size. I have read other comments about them being somewhat small. They are not that small but not huge. I think the issue is more that they serve you in a plastic disposable bowl, whether you eat in or take out. The serving looks small than it is because of the disposable bowl. The prices are a bit high considering you are being served on throw-away plastic bowls and cups.  The overall cost of 2 lunches with ice teas was $34.  This is a bit high especially given you are not in a super special area of town and you are being served on plastic-ware.   This place is mostly really for takeout. I think they can sit maybe 24 people and some of that is on a shared bar type area. On our visit we saw several folks standing around waiting for a table.   The food was good but I think it needs some fine tuning. Specifically, I ordered the top end bowl which had tuna, yellowfin (more tuna) and salmon.  The yellowfin tuna was almost frozen. Yet, it all tasted good. They do have a variety of iced teas with Asian flavors like Mango, green tea, etc.  I will probably give them another try but not sure yet this would be a regular type place yet given the amount of options out there for poke and other Asian type bowls.",

He was not helpful in the least bit and was very sarcastic and condescending. I will be back maybe, but with a new poke place opening in the university area it will be hard to sell me on this place if they are comparable taste wise with better service.

I'd prefer they include a small scoop of each by default or do a base bowl and expensive extras lumped together for a single price. When a sprinkling of cilantro is one of the 4 toppings it comes off as super cheap. I found myself struggling to find toppings after paying about $3 more dollars to get the ones I wanted. I also don't like the spice mix they add to the rice at the beginning and couldn't figure it out until I came back-- where is all that offensive garlic/spice taste coming from? They should have explained that. Like I said --I like the food and concept of Poke bars (and this one almost hits the mark) but the menu construction and pricing bugs me.",

    "text": "Great place for a poke bowl BUT not service.   There is a wide variety of selections in every category. They pack in the ingredients into you bowl so it is a hearty serving; you can expect a filling meal. Very fast and efficient process in building the bowl. I put one star less due to two factors. One it was not friendly customer service more just want to take your order and get you out (not one smile). Two in my visit there was a homeless individual in the store asking each customer for a bowl. This person even first asked the workers for just a bowl of rice. The individual was being nice but very insistent.  All of the workers and manager were completely hands off and ignored the situation. It took a customer to treat the homeless individual to a bowl that helped the situation.  It is a very uncomfortable environment when the store workers and manager do nothing to aid a potential customer in need or give support to the purchasing customers.  I want to give a three stars due to this negative service experience but the food was great. If you want a good poke bowl to try and don't care much about service, since it is like 'subway style' setup, then 4 stars. If you care about the whole experience plus food then 3 stars.   Next time I want a poke bowl I am checking out other locations before returning here. If I return, it would just then be take out.  Other reviews have been positive. This might have been a single event but it did affect my opinion. If I go again and experience it differently, I'll update my review.",

Let me say, we are kind of sushi (and Asian/eastern food) snobs ---- and the quality of the sushi here is AMAZING! I don't even like salmon, and this salmon was like butter, and not fishy at all. I ordered the Ohana Sake bowl (with spicy crab and salmon), and I added tuna. OMG phenomenal The onions and the sweet wasabi sauce were the perfect touch, and I loved the crab + salmon + tuna combo. The kimchee that was part of my bowl is pretty legit too. Umami is really a thing, because one of these bowls really can hit every taste bud and craving that you have!  My husband ordered the King Wicked Tuna, and he was all about those spicy Cheetos. He added spicy mayo and unagi sauce, and thought that it made it better. To sum it up, this place is totally worth a stop! Best part is, you can show up in your workout clothes and no one cares.",

It is like chipotle in that you order at the counter and pick the items to go in your bowl. I had brown rice, tuna, salmon, mango, cukes, carrots and masago. Their citrus dressing was perfect to dip in the side. As it's new, a few kinks to work out. There aren't enough tables currently but that's easy to improve. The beverage selection is limited to teas, juice and water. Wine and beer would be a nice upgrade. Wasabi was considered a topping so I didn't get any. That should be considered a complimentary condiment. And while the bowl looks small, it was surprisingly filling. I'll def be back!",

I wanted to do a preset bowl with tuna instead of salmon bc there are no substitutes of protein on the preset bowls (even though they aren't pre-made which is a bit annoying but alas, I was happy with my end choice). I got a mix of spicy tuna with shrimp and loaded up on my favorite picks and paid extra for avocado ($1.50). My BF did the same with tuna and crab and got seaweed salad for extra $1.50.   It was a good meal. The price is about what it would have been for two people at a sushi dinner so I was okay paying $37 for two bowls and two drinks.   The only thing I wish was different is the size of the bowls. Not the portion sizes, they are great but my tip is to order, take it home and throw your food into a much bigger bowl so you can actually mix it up and enjoy all the chosen ingredients together. Or they could just provide bigger bowls.    We will return for sure.  But we will most likely take it to go.",

While it was expensive, the portions and flavors made it all worth it.  I ordered the Seoul Poke special and it was delicious. It was cumbersome to eat as the bowl was packed to the brim. While it is their most expensive offering, the bowl was filled with three different fish, mango, seaweed, edamame and other toppings i can not remember. The sweetness of the mango paired so well to the saltiness of the seaweed, while the lettuce and rice were the perfect base to deliver every single bite. The staff were eager and willing to accommodate my every desire.  They did not rush nor express any disdain in my indecisiveness.   The bottomline: Seoul Poke Bowl is worth the splurge.",

Everyone is super nice and funny I never had a bad experience coming into this restaurant they're really helpful when it comes to trying something new or making suggestions on what I should put on my bowl. My favorite is Ohana Sake bowl.",

My friends think he just forgot but I think it's because they care about their customers and wanted us to have a good experience. I mean it could be that he just forgot idk tbh. I had salmon, tuna and one other meat I can't remember it was a while ago. All I remember was having a good meal. It was between that and hungry howies. I like hungry howies but I'm glad I tried this place out. Will be going back for sure. Might bring my mom and dad too next time they're in charlotte.",

So me and the family stopped by to see what all the hype was about, BELIEVE THE HYPE! There's only one bad thing about the place, I would have to start eating early lunches because there's constantly such a long line. They just do it really good!",

There were a wide variety of toppings including a starch, protein and veggies served with delicious toppings. I got the greens, spicy pork, edamame, corn, red onions rice noodles and a few other veggies with a delicious cream sauce to top it off. Yum!  I enjoy getting healthy fast food! It was a little pricey but that's the way it goes with eating healthy! I will go again.",
