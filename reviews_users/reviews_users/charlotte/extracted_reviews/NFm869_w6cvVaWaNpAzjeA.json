    "text": "Okay so I have no idea why I have not written a review for Soul because this is my absolute favorite restaurant ever. In the world. First the Hip eclectic ambiance is perfect for date night or just a night cap with drink . The Dj is always on point and will have you grooving in your seat. The staff is always friendly and service is always great. I would recommend calling before hand seeing that this place is very popular and the wait can get a little lengthy depending on what time and what day of the week you go. They specialize in tapas, or small plates, which is why this place is perfect for someone who enjoys many flavors and wants to try many different things in one sitting. Each dish comes out as it is ready which is nice so you don't have to worry about everything coming out on top of each other.  I have had every thing on the menu with the exception of maybe one or two things but trust me I am getting around to it. Of course I have my favorites. The pork belly tacos are a must! Everything about them is why you should try them and I'm sure everyone who has had them will agree their truffle fries are amazing along with the fried brussels sprouts which give you a perfect balance of sweet and savory. I have had the curried lamb skewers, and the chimichurri beef which are both amaze-balls and you cant go wrong with either! The veal short ribs are to die for and you shouldn't hesitate on ordering that Ramen bowl! I can always go for those sashimi tuna tacos, the cucumber and sriracha mayo together in one bite is heaven! I always end my meal with one of those grilled caesar salads and I never regret it! They have an awesome sushi selection and the drink list is one of a kind! I wish I could give this place more stars! Soul has earned a spot in my taste bud heart forever  WELL DONE SOUL!",

    "text": "Really wanted to go to this place for a while now. Today was finally the day. First and foremost, I have to say, that this was the most non-family friendly place ever. No high chairs or booster seats, also, we got a tiny table for 3 people (me, my husband, and our toddler). Even though our server was otherwise great, he only served the table for 2, and only brought a third glass for water upon request. We ordered two small plates: Rocky Mountain oysters (pretty good, too much cornmeal, which took away from the delicate flavor, in my opinion), and Shells stuffed with pulled pork in cheese sauce (the pork filling was on the dry side and overall underwhelming, even though the cheese sauce was delicious). My husband also had a steak and eggs sandwich, which was for some reason was served open-faced and pretty much impossible to eat as a sandwich. I tried a few bites - it was very under seasoned, although the quality of steak was top-notch. I ordered a chicken pita wrap - absolutely delicious, no complaints there.  For dessert we had the chocolate brioche bread pudding, which tasted more like a dry brownie; and banana turnovers, which were decent, but not more than that.  A few other tables around us ordered food that looked and smelled much better. And the tables are so close together that you could really really see and smell what the other people are eating)) and hear their conversations, and occasionally rub elbows.  I'm considering coming back in a solely grown up company, to try some of the cocktails, bone marrow, noodle bowl and the Korean bbq chicken wings.  It wasn't a terrible experience, but definitely a bit of a let down.",

Ordered the pork belly tacos, the chicken skin nachos, the shells and cheese, pan con tomate, ahi tuna tacos, and the Korean wings. The shells and the pan con tomate were some of the favorites of the group. Wasn't a huge fan of the wings. Would have probably gotten the short ribs or another dish but hindsights 20/20. Get here early though! I showed up at 450, 10 minutes before they opened, and shortly after all the tables were taken, as they don't take reservations. Definitely a solid place and I can see why it's rated too high. Service was solid throughout, but i, all about the food anyway.",

    "text": "I'd give this place 3 and a half stars if I could, but I can't, so here you have it.  Look - the food at Soul is really quite good.  Loads of variety, and well made and presented.  I haven't had anything here yet that I wasn't impressed by.  The cocktails are better than the food, if that's possible.  Knowledgeable barstaff make great drinks, and relatively quickly, too.  Sounds like a 5 star review, right?  Well, the thing that kills Soul is that it's gotten too popular for its own good.  There is always -- ALWAYS -- a wait to be seated, and they don't take reservations, which really grinds my gears.  If you want to sit down to a meal at night, the DJ is often playing too loud for you to have good conversation with your dinner company, and you'll likely spend a fair bit of coin to order enough small plates to make it a real meal.  Maybe a 45 minute wait to sit down and eat appeals to some people - maybe it makes you feel like you're in New York, or that you're experiencing something truly special, or it gives your visit some sense of occasion.  For me, it makes me wonder why I'm not giving my time and money to any number of other really great food places within a quick walk, bike, or drive of Soul.",

    "text": "Soul is always in my top Charlotte restaurants-to-recommend list. This place is amazing. Tiny, but amazing nonetheless.   Soul is tucked away in the second floor of a brick building in the busy, hip neighborhood of Plaza Midwood. There is ALWAYS a wait for a table at night and for brunch when available. They do not take reservations so if you're smart you'll try to get there early to get your name on the list. There have been several nights I've easily waited an hour and a half for a table and just went downstairs to 22 (an art gallery that serves alcoholic beverages) to have a couple beers before they sent a text saying our table was ready.   Soul's menu consists of tapas and sushi. It's best to order 2 small plates per person and share everything. My favorites are the Soul Roll (sushi), Lamb Lollipops, Cheese Plate, Chimichuri Beef Skewers. Goat Cheese Balls and Tuna Tacos. You can't go wrong with anything at Soul. Also, ask your server for the daily specials. They're usually crazy unique and worth trying.   The atmosphere at Soul reminds me of a small hip restaurant in New York. A DJ spins while you eat dinner or sip on craft cocktails at the bar. The decor and small space make for a vibe that is inviting, warm, and eclectic.   Parking in this area of Plaza Midwood sucks so be on the lookout for tow-friendly spots. You can sometimes park at the parking lot across the street for $5. Good luck finding street parking at night.  If you're planning on making a night of it at Soul, bring some loot. For dinner and drinks for 2 people, you're likely to spend between $100-$150. Well worth it for a fun date night that's different from the usual.   Soul should definitely be on your list of Charlotte restaurants to visit if it isn't already. It's an awesome spot for a date night or with a small group of friends. FYI, large tables will wait forever to be sat, if at all so keep it small!",

    "text": "We checked out Soul Gastrolounge a couple years ago and for some reason... we didn't really like it. Despite our lack luster experience the place has always remained one of Charlotte's most popular restaurants. While hanging out with some friends they suggested we check out Soul again and we reluctantly agreed. Thank God we did... Soul rocks!  We must have either ordered the wrong stuff or caught them on an off night the first time because this second look at Soul Gastrolounge left us wanting more, and more, and way more. Since we were able to go as a group and split the plates we ended up ordering a lot more than if we had gone alone. We tried the:  Garlic Shrimp Chimichurri Beef Dirty South Nachos Sticky Veal Shortribs Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos Pan Con Tomate Soul Korean BBQ Wings Wild Mushrooms on Toast Ahi Tuna with Sesame & Soy Drizzle Duck Bahn Fi Sandwich  All of which was delicious and worth recommending but for me the star of the show was easily the pork belly tacos :)",

I even saw Bob the Bartender slinging drinks from behind the bar, so that is always a great sign.  We tried to go here a number of times, but the place is small, there is always a long wait, so get there early, (i.e. before dinner time) if you want to sit immediately.  I started off with the Pork Belly Tacos, and they were amazing.  I would suggest splitting these, though, as they get heavy on your stomach pretty quick.  Especially if you are going to sample other menu items.  The fried cheese was also great.  I ended up just eating by itself, rather than on the bread.  The service was slightly below average, as it seems like they serve their food in batches (e.g. they make a large batch of pork bell tacos and everyone gets it at the same time regardless of when you ordered), and our server was mostly absent.  The big down sides are 1) getting a seat, and 2) sitting on the lap of absolute strangers once you do get a seat.  I really hate cramped seating, so next time I would try and get their 1-2 booths that have.  I would love to come back here for some drinks, but I would target an afternoon or an off peak time.",

Our go to's are the tuna tacos and the dynamite and red dragon rolls. Their daily specials and cocktails are always special and delish.   The first time we went on a Saturday and waited more than 2 hours but we learned a trick that if you go right after work during the week you won't have to wait at all. It might be worth waiting on your first visit but after that you just want to be able to get seated right away. If you do wait, the place downstairs (twenty two) always has great exhibitions and reasonable drinks.   Although we are young, we are not typically into the hipster scene but this place is really a great environment for all.",

It was the perfect blend of salty and sweet and I hope I can figure out  way to re-create it.  Top the food with excellent service, I will be back!",

Too cramped of a space with too many people that care who's checking them out from the balcony.  Overall, the atmosphere and food is great, but they could step up their game with service and pricing and/or portion sizes. I might go there on a day when I have nothing better to do or if I want to be a bit more fancy, but I don't find myself coming here often.",

    "text": "I came to Soul on a Saturday night at 8PM with three other ladies.  We knew they did not take reservations and were expecting a wait.  We were quoted 1.5 hours and decided to have some drinks at the bar.  The bar service was great.  After 1.5 hours of waiting I checked in with the hostess and she said there were four other groups in front of us.  A little after a 2 hour wait we got our table.  If the hostess had any thought of us waiting over 1.5 hours she should've quoted us that.  Honestly, that is the only huge negative thing I have to say about this restaurant.    Now, onto dinner.  The menu has a little bit of everything ranging from Greek to Asian to American food.  We ordered a lot of different things, but I will only list my favorites: the lamb lollipops, the Soul Roll, the pork belly tacos, and the brussel sprouts.  The server at our table was fast and attentive.  We did order dessert and I do not recommend the cupcake or the pistashio ice cream.  The cupcake was dry and the ice cream wasn't cold, yet it was solid.  Weird.    Overall, expect a long wait and a delicious meal, but please skip dessert.",

Whenever I walk in I instantly feel like an inconvenience to the hostess. They have never even said hello, just stared at me until I asked them how many hours the wait was this time around...spoiler alert, its always 2, even on a rainy, cold Wednesday night. Funny considering there are never that many people waiting. Its almost like they don't want any more business.  I would consider waiting the ridiculous amount of time too, except I am already so pissed off by the hostess's attitude that I would rather go anywhere else than give money to their establishment. If you're going to insist all your patrons either eat dinner at 5:00 p.m. or wait a ridiculous amount of time to get a table, the least you could be is accommodating and helpful about it.   Nobody wants to wait over 2 hours to get a table in the middle of the week....just start accepting reservations. Not sure what you have to lose. In fact, you would probably gain my business.",

Arrive around 6:30 PM on Saturday night, put our names in with the hostess.  30-45 minute wait expected.  OK, no problem.  Head downstairs and enjoy a nice brew and a chat.  Go back up to check on things after 50 minutes.  Next 2 person table that comes free is ours!  Alright!    Wait around near the hostess station for 30 more minutes.  See 2 tables come free about the same time.  Hostess proceeds to push the 2 2-person tables together to make a nice seat for 4.  Oh no!    Approach hostess to inquire.  She has a table ready for us.  OK, all is forgiven.   We're shown to our \"table\", which looks a lot like two seats at the bar.  In fact, it is two seats at the bar.    Silly Soul Gastrolounge!  If we had desired seats at the bar, we would have gone ahead and taken them 2 hours ago.  Needless to say, we got up and left immediately and won't ever go back.  Doesn't matter if they are serving up gigantic platters of Ambrosia plucked from God's own orchards, no food on earth is good enough for that kind of service.   We went down the road to Fern and were treated to a delicious meal with excellent service.  Go there instead, people.",

    "text": "So, one of my Meetup groups had an outing planned here that I wasn't able to make but the name intrigued me.  Automatically I started thinking that I don't know if I would want to eat at a place that eludes to anything that is gastrointestinal related.  However, my curiosity continued to get the best of me despite the name, so I checked out the website.  I was impressed with what I saw.  I'm a crazy picky eater so there are some dishes on the menu that you couldn't pay me to try, but there were also several that excited my stomach.  I'm a music junkie so I became even more excited when I read that different local DJs hit the ones and twos every night!  I said to myself, \"Self, we are so going to Soul Gastrolounge!\"    One of my friends and I met up there on a Friday night around 9:00 and the place was packed!  There's a really cool outdoor patio that overlooks the street and inside is dimly lit and full of a laid-back, eccentric vide.  I thought to myself, \"I've found where I belong (tear, sniffle, sniffle).\"  My friend and I were told that we would have an hour and 15 minute wait, which normally would've sent us packing but we were fully committed.  So, we chose to wait at Twenty-Two (check out my review) which is right below S.G.  When it was time for us to be seated we were lead to a bar right by the DJ booth (who was awesome btw).  Our server came by in a matter of seconds to take our drink orders and then we perused the menu.  Since I had already looked at it online I decided to order the Soul Wings (I wasn't feeling as adventurous that night but trust me I'll going back to try oh so much more.) and the french fries with garlic-herb salt, pecorino & truffle oil.  The wings were okay but I loved the fries.  Our server came back to check on us several times throughout our stay and was pretty darn amazing.    I'll definitely be back here.  The food options are just about limitless, reasonably priced and the service was awesome.  I say \"YES\" to Soul Gastrolounge and you should too!",

    "text": "Whenever my wife and I feel like doing something lounge-esque but don't feel like dealing with the douchebaggery (from both men and women) that passes for the norm at bars and clubs on Tryon Street, we'll venture to Soul Gastrolounge for good food, stiff cocktails, and some well-chosen chillout music.   Soul Gastrolounge, thankfully, is devoid of the bling-ridden, obnoxious pretension that soulless dead ends like Cosmos Cafe is so guilty of. Here, you'll find a mix of urban professionals, hipsters, regular joes, all walks, so to speak. You won't be made to feel out of place here. The staff, from the hostess to the waitstaff, are very friendly; the waiter who served us the last time around offered a few suggestions that were first-rate, and he did so with cheerful aplomb. Did I just use the word \"aplomb?\" Of course, expect crowds on a Friday or Saturday night, but if you time it just right, you can get a table right after 9pm or so, when patrons fool enough to go hit the bars and clubs on Tryon vacate their tables. Suckas.  I love the vibe here. Dimly lit, but not dark, the music loud enough but not deafening, and, yeah, it's crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, but you never get the feel that you've got someone brushing up against you. Unless you like having someone brush up against you. Whatever works, son.  The food itself is the attraction for me. Soul Gastrolounge takes its culinary cue from the classic tapas bar set-up; you're hungry, but you don't want a big meal, you want something you and your party can pick on and share together. There's definitely much on the menu in terms of appetizers and tapas to choose from. The sushi is also quite spectacular, surprising for a non-sushi restaurant.  I particularly enjoy eating and drinking on the balcony. At night, you're blessed with an uncluttered view of uptown Charlotte. The balcony's a bit crowded, since it's quite narrow, but the view's pretty nice, plus, if you're lucky, you'll get to see the freight train come across the heart of Central Avenue.  Honestly, I'd eat at Soul Gastrolounge any time, even when we're not feeling lounge-y. This is one of my favorite places to eat in town.",

Soul has always been on my list of to-dos, but I think I always found myself going somewhere else because I couldn't find anything super special about this place ... but boy, was I wrong.  We came in around 8:30 p.m. on Monday and didn't have to wait, but the place was packed. Seated and greeted immediately, we took a minute to look over the menu and decided on starting with the dip trio; we chose hummus (which I believe was Tahini that day), tzatziki, and some caviar sauce. Despite loving all three of them, the dips lasted us all our courses, and there was still so much leftover at the end.  With guidance from our server, we ordered the Korean BBQ wings, dirty nachos and pork belly tacos.  The wings were super tender, and the sauce wasn't anything I expected. Honestly, I could've done without the dirty nachos; the chicken skins tasted almost burnt and the pimento cheese seemed to be just melted American. The pork belly tacos were by far my favorite, and they are reasonably hyped. Sweetness of the pork belly was perfectly balanced with the sourness of the watermelon.  For dessert, we had the chocolate brioche bread pudding with a miso caramel ice cream. I loved the ice cream because the caramel wasn't too overpowering. The bread pudding itself wasn't too chocolatey either, and the perfect size.  Needless to say, will be back, and I can't wait.",

The menu changes a fair bit, but unlike most places, I never have trouble finding several things I like.   If you haven't tried the pork belly watermelon tacos - they will change your life. Do. Not. Miss. Them.  Remember - they don't take reservations, and there is almost always a 1-2 hour wait. The pro move is to put your name in with the hostess (or use the NoWait app to get on the list), and then go across the street to Peculiar Rabbit or Workman's Friend for a drink while you wait for your name to be called.",

Unfortunately, this is not a little known secret, and it has become a popular dining destination. Expect a wait; it's part of the experience.   Yelpers love the pork belly tacos topped with watermelon cubes, and taking their cue, I followed suit. This was a good decision. We also ordered the ramen bowl, which consisted of noodles topped with garlic cream, braised veal, goat cheese fried mushrooms... it was good. This was a moment I had to remind myself not to lick the bowl...  When asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu; I informed our server I would just take a gander. Which lead me to ordering the chocolate brioche bread pudding. I am a sucker for cocoa nibs and caramel ice cream, and couldn't resist.  There are many options on the menu I am excited to try on our next visit, too!",

Ambiance is perfect for meeting up with friends for an evening catch-up with a good menu of small plates that won't leave you hungry.  The pork belly tacos are spectacular.  There are some unexpected things on the menu (rocky mountain oysters) as well as some fun flavors.    I was a little confused on the sushi here as it seemed overly flavored with sauces so the fish doesn't really stand out.  Perhaps a matter of preference, but sushi didn't really fit into the overall theme and feel of the restaurant and seemed like an unnecessary distraction from an otherwise lengthy menu.  It is still a place that I come back to occasionally because of some of the signature go-to items.  Tip:  Use the \"No wait\" app to put your name in ahead of time.  It doesn't guarantee you a spot outside, but does help reduce the wait time since they don't accept reservations.",

The parking reminded me of New Jersey/New York having to pay to park or drive around until you find a free one so I chose to pay $5 which ain't bad. Located upstairs and when I say it's a hot spot, it was LIVE and packed. The music was great and the bartender I had (cool guy with these awesome throwback shades) made perfect drinks & recommended drinks for my friends. Our bartender was able to explain the drinks very well and sold us on a few.  We ended up ordering a few tapas which were cooked to perfection & I wanted to order more but this was just a pit stop . It took a while for the tapas to come out (Lamb, Shrimp, Beef, Wings) but was so worth it. We met tons of nice folks.  I will say the place seems small bc it was packed and we were told a 2hr wait for a table so thank goodness we came just in time when a group was leaving. We stayed there for at least 3 hrs and the 3 tables near the bar were there before we got there and we left before them so heads up folks.   Come for tapas & drinks chill at the bar or go outside on the patio. It's good people watching outside so hint hint .",

They don't take reservations and the restaurant is small, but it is worth the wait and the cocktails are good and strong, so grab one while you wait for a table. It's best to go with someone who has similar tastes in food so that you can order together and try bits of everything. I recommend the fried brussels sprouts, shells and cheese with bbq glazed pork belly, and the red dragon roll. I also had the Asian glazed pork belly tacos (which is one of their top sellers) - great flavor and outer crispiness to the pork belly. I tried the fried cheese goat cheese on bruschetta but could live without getting that again.  Nice service, as well. They warn you when you sit down, but the tapas come out as they're ready - not all at once - to keep everything fresh.",

It is a TAPAS place so, one dish is NOT going to fill you up. So I think the $$ is misleading. It should be $$$ due to the fact that you have to order multiple plates to be tastefully satisfied. Drinks are sky high in cost. There is limited seating and you may end up in the lounge area eating on a couch and a coffee table. Get a drink before dinner downstairs at Twenty Two (a gallery / bar) and look at some art. Actually it is a great place to go to get a drink while you wait for your table upstairs.",

I recently took my cousin and her fiance as they were visiting from Poland and they both enjoyed their experience (probably him more than her).  We each started with a drink, my cousin and I got the Rose, and he got a scotch on the rocks. The waiter mixed up orders and brought two scotch on the rocks but that wasn't a hard fix :). They offer cucumber water so if you want plain, be sure to let your waiter/waitress know. It's very refreshing and light, and I enjoy that little difference they offer. Who isn't bored of regular water with a lemon anyways??  It's a tapas style restaurant so we shared the stuffed piquillo peppers, garlic fries, tuna tacos, and bone marrow. I haven't had a bad experience with Soul's food and that's a reason I keep coming back.  The last couple times I've been a bit disappointed that my bone marrow bone was very small and in turn, yielded very little bone marrow to enjoy. Luckily this time I had a nice, deep bone and all three of us were able to enjoy it. The texture is a little slimy and bulky, sometimes salty but it melts in your mouth...don't forget to add it on top the provided grilled bread, so delicious. Tuna tacos never fail either. They're marinated, diced tuna in fried wonton tacos (thin and light), with marinated cucumbers and sriracha mayo (not spicy).  The fries are garlic-herb salted, dusted with pecorino & truffle oil are always necessary to get. They are thin (almost McDonalds looking), and not greasy so you don't feel too bad eating them. Trust me, try them if you haven't. The herb cheese stuffed piquillo peppers on bruschetta are sooo good. The cheese is light, not heavy feeling and compliments being stuff inside the pepper. They come out warm on the bruschetta so I'd recommend eating them when they arrive. No worries if it cools a little because they're still delicious. My cousin and her fiance had a lamb gyro and enjoyed it. It was a reasonable size as they were able to split it between them.  Overall this experience went well. It was later at night when we arrived so there wasn't a wait (about 10pm), but if you're looking to go closer to the weekend you could be waiting for hours. Prior to this visit I utilized the \"no wait\" app and I'd suggest doing the same as well because once everyone gets out of work, or its dinner time on the weekend, the place will fill up real quick. Very quickly. I mentioned living close by so the \"no wait\" app works perfectly. (No joke) about 1.5-2.5 hrs before I know we want to go to dinner, I put our name on he list and just wait. An hour prior to their guesstimated time I will start getting ready and once we're the next to be seated we start walking over. I once put our name on the no wait app a little late (630-7pm?) and were given such a late time that we opted to go somewhere else. We forgot to take our name off the list and we're finally messaged around 1130 that a table was ready. We've already eaten elsewhere and made it uptown by that point so no need to make it over. Needless to say, do some research and utilize the no wait app if Soul is still affiliated with it. Otherwise you may not get to eat at a reasonable hour unless you score a seat at the bar which is first come first serve. Or, you may like the Parisian eating schedule, and all I'd have to say is \"enjoy\" :).   Great place, amazing and different food, great vibe with upbeat music... try to make a stop in if you're in from out of town. Your guests shouldn't be disappointed... unless they like the normal burger and fries or shrimp scampi and don't like trying new things.",

    "text": "My husband wanted to treat me to a nice evening while we visited Charlotte for my birthday weekend and, because of the great reviews on Yelp and the fact that we love tapas, we gave Soul a try.   It felt a little uncomfortable at first because, as cool as we like to think we are for 50-somethings, we are not that hip. This place attracts a young crowd. They don't take reservations, and I knew we were in for a good 1.5 hour wait and all I could think was, what in the world will we do? In total, this place is less than 1000 sq ft inside and out. There is absolutely no where to stand, sit, or lean against, and the crowd on a Sat. night was tight. The stars must have been in my favor because one barstool opened up in the \"first come first served\" area and we claimed it for the next, you guessed it, 1.5 hours. While we waited, I sipped wine and water, and my hub tried one of their signature mixed drinks. We had a lot of time to watch all the bartenders, all of whom were very fast, talented, and knew how to handle the crowd (especially a very drunk, loud and offensive guy who was asked to leave. Nice touch).    While we waited, we also tried the dip trio, which came with generous amounts of tzatziki, babaganoush, and hummus, with mostly too-hard-to-eat (and burned) pita chips. As Robert Irvine would say, something like that should have never left the kitchen. Though, our wonderfully attentive bartenders made up for that faux pas by refilling our chips every time the bowl was near empty. It was all good, but I really enjoyed the tzatziki the most, and it would have been even better with warm, soft pita. As you might imagine, I wasn't very hungry by the time our table was ready.   Anyway, after getting there around 7:45, we were seated around 9:30 or so. I ordered the avocado stack, which is a salad of sliced avocado, red onion, cilantro, tomato and fried garlic, drizzled with olive oil. So pretty (see pic) and tasty. I then tried the garlic skewered shrimp, which was light and savory. I enjoyed all of this while my hub sat across from me with nothing in front of him, as I believe his mango sushi order was lost. Ever the patient one, he nibbled off my plates until his sushi finally arrived, and it was beautiful (see pic). A huge portion, and he said some of the best sushi he's ever had.  I saw people ordering the pork belly tacos, which are described on the menu with \"watermelon salsa\". Interestingly enough, they come out looking like three cubes of meat on a flour tortilla, with three cubes of watermelon on top of the meat, so it's not actually a chopped up salsa. I wondered if the watermelon was marinated and will have to give it a try next time.   We were too tired and full for dessert so didn't indulge, as much as I would have loved to try the bread pudding cupcake with pretzel whipped cream.   So all in all, a great evening of food and entertainment. A DJ did start spinning music about 9:00 or so, and it was a mix of everything from 80s to techno to jazz, which went along with the cool vibe of this place with the exposed brick, open rafters, and low lighting. Just go prepared to be patient and wait if you show up at prime time, and just relax and enjoy something new.",

Started off with a Tito's winter mule, I'm really into ginger so I knew this was the drink for me, it was really really good. The menu is very extensive it was hard to narrow it down to a reasonable level of what we could actually eat. So here goes. Bone marrow, fried brussel sprouts, chicken skewers, serrano ham & manchego on toast,I know there was something else can't remember what and I was so into the meal I didn't get pics of everything...that alone let's you know how good it was...giggle. the bone marrow was a little too gamey for me, could be the type of meat it was from, have had it before & loved it, not so much here. Loooved the brussel sprouts the BEST i've had anywhere and I've had a lot of them :) the ham & cheese was also really good, didn't try the chicken as this was a day filled with food & drink but my dinner companions loved them. The service was great too. Would like to come back next time!",

We left our name with the hostess and went to the bar, which was also full, so we stood around with others while we waited to be seated.  The whole time while standing at the bar, we noticed an empty table for four, perfect for us.  After about 15-20 minutes, we were seated at this very table.  Wonder what took them so long.  Soul offers a variety of tapas and sushi and we ordered several items including: the crunch roll, goat cheese toasts, yellowtail roll, hamachi roll, chicken skewers, Asian wings, sashimi tuna tacos, little neck clams, sticky veal shortribs, and Mediterranean wings.  Everything was excellent.  The fish used in each of the sushi plates was fresh and delicious.  The sashimi tuna tacos are really fragile, though and pretty much break when you try to pick them up.  Each tapas or sushi dish runs about $7-8.  The inside of the restaurant is dark, stylish, trendy, etc.  Candle-lit tables, comfy booths and chairs, nice atmosphere, and a good spot to take a date.  In fact, one of the people I ate with like it so much, he decided to take his date here the following Saturday.  Additional notes: water here is optionally served with a slice of cucumber, the bathrooms are unisex, you have to walk up/down a set of stairs outside of the building to get in/out of the restaurant, and service was good.",

I asked for a table for 2, and mind you there are NO reservations there, and there were many tables open at the time. It seemed painful for her to talk to me but she was able to belch out it would be a 30-40 minute wait. We sat at the bar waiting for the 30 minutes at least ( all along by the way, they were seating other groups immediately that were walking in, with no reservations either ) and were finally texted to say our table was ready. I walked over , right after they had just seated another walk in immediately, and she proceeded to tell me that the \"2\" seater tables ARE the bar and she moved us down about 5 seats .... huh???? LOL!!! We left. Very judgmental about class there and if you aren't the \"soul bar\" type and are a party of 2 only.... this is NOT your fit! DO NOT go there.",

Must orders: pork belly tacos, dirty south nachos (trust me on this), salmon 'o pita, Charlotte roll, the foie gras, and the pierogies on the brunch menu.  Can't say enough great things about this place!!",

The food is really just quite average and was unimpressed with everything that I tried. The pork belly tacos seem to be a favorite of the majority of reviewers. I thought the flavors of the pork belly with the chunks of watermelon was really just a muddy mess of flavors in my mouth. The sushi was just fair. I have had much fresher sushi and sashimi from other places in the Charlotte area. Frankly I've given this a rating of 2 stars for an average over the ambience of 5 stars and the decent tasting brussel sprouts and edamame. This place is just overpriced and over rated however if you're looking for a romantic type of ambiance for decent cocktails alone I highly recommend it .",

    "text": "So, I finally made it over here after hearing about it since before I even moved to Charlotte. I love the space and the vibe; it's even cool that it's only accessible via what is essentially a fire-escape ladder. I love the bar that it hovers above (even though I can never remember if it's called Twenty Two or Twenty Three) and I love. Love. LOVE. Plaza Midwood in general. My hopes were high for Soul.  My ONE gripe - it's easily the restaurant I've had the toughest time finding gluten-free options in since I've been in Charlotte. I never want to be that person, so I didn't even ask the waiter for suggestions, but I'm not sure I would have been able to hear her anyway - place is LOUD. Boyfriend and I were there on a Wednesday night at 7pm and we could barely hear each other across the small table. Side note: there was about a 45-minute wait. On a random Wednesday night. It's a popular spot.  And still, you say, Soul deserves 4 stars? Really, Amy? Well, everything we had was absolutely incredible. As mentioned before, I'm an annoying gluten-free bitch. Even though I didn't eat 1/3 of the ingredients in the pork belly tacos (flour tortilla), the other 2/3 (pork belly and watermelon) were delicious enough that I'm still salivating over them 3 weeks later. Holy eff, that combination is deadly. Sweet, salty, indescribably amazing.  Brussel sprouts were some of the best I've ever had. Fries were BANGING. Sushi was decent, but we probably ordered the wrong roll (crunch roll) - some other rolls floating around the restaurant looked better. We only spent about $45 due to the fact that most of the other items had unavoidable gluten. But I can still safely say that I get it, Charlotte. This place is something special.",

The menu has quite a variety of tapas including sushi-which makes my heart and belly happy. We ordered the white bean and goat cheese dip, napoleon sushi roll, shells and cheese, fried meatballs, stuffed peppers on bruschetta, and the goat cheese flat bread. Oh man we're we stuffed by the time we left. Everything was delicious, but the piquillo stuffed pepper on bruschetta was the stand out. It was stuffed with an herb cheese & was sweet. Second favorite was the Napoleon roll - it has tuna, cream cheese, and jalapeno inside, then fried and topped with eel sauce. All of my favorite things. The shells with cheese are giant stuffed shells with almost like a fine pulled pork inside, I would've enjoyed these a lot more if I wasn't already so full. Beware-your eyes will probably be bigger than your stomach here.    On a staff note, everyone was extremely nice & quick.

When I tried to explain to the host that he was a service animal, he told me that they'd had too many issues with dogs and I would still have to sit on the patio. So again I tried to explain that as a service animal he is legally allowed to go anywhere I go. The host rolled his eyes and said if I really wanted to sit inside I would have to wait while he discussed it with the manager, but it would be a bit because they were busy. So we left.  Just to clarify, my service dog is fully trained and well behaved. The dog had done nothing to be denied entry for. I was literally told that I couldn't be inside with him almost as soon as I walked through the door. But since it was July and 95 degrees out, sitting outside wasn't an option for me.   Since my disability seemed to be such an inconvenience for them, we will happily spend our money elsewhere.",

The Favorite cocktail (on tap) was refreshing and all of the food was really flavorful. We got the tuna tacos, edamame, truffle fries, and two sushi rolls (both tempura battered). The only downsides were that we were told we couldn't change an ingredient in the sushi rolls (which makes me wonder if they're premade) and it took a while, probably because they were so busy.",

Other dishes were good, shared the tuna skewers and the shrimp ceviche. But for a restaurant that features sushi, their rice should NOT be an issue.",

Our favorites: spicy tuna roll, mushrooms on toast, saganaki, bone marrow, and grilled Caesar... but everything we've had over the decade we've been going has been great. The cocktails are always perfectly made. Desserts can be hit or miss but I won't ding them a star for that as they're always changing.",

The drinks are pricey..tasty...but expensive for what you are getting.  All in all it seems like my review is pretty negative.  BUT--I'm serious, the food is worth it.  I will wait in that line and put up with whatever to get some pork belly tacos.  Most everything on the menu is good, a few exceptions to that rule (meatballs, steak & egg, some of the sushi) but for the most part, the dishes are creative and delicious.   Use the no wait app to put yourself in line and eliminate your wait.  It's way worth it it.  The patio is cold in the winter, the heaters do help some, though.  Hot in the summer...deal with & sweat away while sipping your crafty wallet cinching cocktail!!!! But please, make sure you get the pork belly tacos!!! Did I mention they are my fav??!!",

    "text": "I'm often asked by friends and fellow yelpers, \"what's a place I should try?\" Or, \"what's your favorite restaurant?\"  The answer I always unflinchingly give is Soul Gastrolounge. With that, here's everything you need to know Soul...  1. LOONG WAIT. The wait to get a table can be long. Very long.  I mean its pretty simple, do NOT go to Soul on Thursday or Friday night and expect to get in and out within 2hrs.  Therefore, I only go to Soul on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.  Oh, and they don't accept reservations.  2.  NO LUNCH.  That's right, Soul doesn't open until 5pm.  I usually try to get there a little later in the evening; usually after the main dinner rush, around 9pm or so.    3.  DJs & Tunes! I'm not 100% sure, but I believe they have a DJ on hand Thursday - Saturday nights starting around 9pm.  The DJ's are always on point with the music and really add to Soul's trendy vibe and reputation it has around Charlotte.    4. NO PARKING.  There's no parking lot, or area exclusively for Soul's patrons.  Your best bet is to park in the lot across the street near CVS (sometimes its $5), or anywhere else around the heart of Plaza Midwood (near Thomas Street Tavern/Whiskey Warehouse) and walking over.   5. The FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!  Although I've tried many items on the menu from the pork belly sliders, to the steak and eggs which both make my mouth water, my favorite item is the Sakana Roll.  Its a tuna, salmon, avocado, sushi roll lightly fried - simply the best sushi in Charlotte!  If sushi's not your thing, don't worry there's plenty of great menu items as I said the steak and eggs or any of the skewers are great.  The humus of the day and guac stack are both great tasting, lighter options.  The french fries w/truffle oil are out of this world yummy!!   6. HIP. COOL. VIBE.  I like Soul's ambiance so much because its the perfect representation of the people and culture of Plaza-Midwood and Charlotte as a whole.  Its young, hip, chill, and different.  Everything from the walk up the black steps, to the dark interior, to the tight bar, to the blue peacock hanging behind that same bar; create a happening, mellow vibe thats unmistakeable.    Soul perfectly in-captures everything I value in a dining experience. From the amazing and unique food, to the trendy ambiance, to the phenomenal service - everything pops at Soul.  Soul, what a great name for an establishment that truly represents the heart and soul of the Queen City.",

Went out here on two separate occasions and both times I just was not impressed. Listen, I love going out and spending money. Growing up in Atlantic City I have spent plenty of money on martinis however those martinis were top of the line handcrafted cocktails. A mule on tap has no business being as expensive as it was. I understand all that goes in to making a mule and even a mule with homemade ginger beer shouldn't cost that much and if it does cost that much for god sake I have had a better one at PF Changs. The brussel sprouts on the other hand were amazing but 4? seriously brussel sprouts are pricey but jeezo you cut them in half for god sake so I literally paid for two halved Brussels sprouts, well done brussel sprouts, but still not worth it. I'm cooking at home from now on",

They have a patio, but they could do more with it and should.  If you've got a view like that, I'd splurge on a better quality winter enclosure so you could seat that space.  We tried several things, Ramen Bowl, Pork Skewer, Salad, Fried Oysters, Salmon-kopita, and maybe something I've forgotten.  The Salmon-kopita was in the lightest, crispiest wrapping ever, but they should give your a warning - I bit into one and blistered the roof of my mouth immediately, it was boiling hot inside.  It didn't taste like salmon at all, though, but it was crispy and creamy and had a good flavor.  So I guess not being salmon-y would be a good thing for some people.  The Pork, Oysters and something else were good, but the Ramen Bowl with Braised Veal and Fried Goat Cheese stuffed Mushroom Balls with Garlic Cream Sauce was phenomenal!  I like that so much I went back the next night and got it again.  I think this is a fun place with interesting options and I will go again.",

Next thing I knew he spotted a couple who was about to leave and he asked them to make sure they gave a seat to me. Way cool. So my take = service is great whenever you come. Just be patient.

Sushi is also very good, I really enjoyed the Soul roll. Ramen bowl was pretty disappointing, didn't want any more after one bite.   Be aware: the app they use that tells you your place in line is not accurate. We thought we had plenty of time so we were out and about, killing time (we were told a two-three hour wait)...

AMAZING! Will be back for sure.  Tip: If you'd like to hear your dinner partner do not go on Friday or Saturday night. They have a DJ that plays entirely too loud of music if you even want to call it that.   Follow me @jodieats",

    "text": "Perhaps my favorite restaurant in Charlotte despite a few negatives. The food is phenomenal. Great variety, well worth the money. The downside is that you have to be strategic about when to go because it is always busy, especially during the weekends. Not a place to go with a large group of people for the same reason. My first attempt to go there, I went with a group of  8 on a Friday night and waited 2 hours, and ended up leaving. The hostess was rude and the impression that we got from their service was that they can afford to be rude because their food is so GREAT and customers are willing to overlook that.  My next time around, it was better... but then again I went on a Wednesday night  with one friend at 9pm (still crowded but wait was 5min).   In sum, my 5 star rating is for the food quality and the ambiance once you are seated.",

    "text": "This place is amazing! Their music is always fantastic. Dishes can run on the small side, which I think can throw off some people that don't understand the tapas concept, but if you go in understanding that then you won't be disappointed. Another thing - like a True tapas place, they serve dishes as they are made and say so on their menu, so don't expect all your food to come out together. This does mean that all their dishes are exceptionally fresh. Also, mad props to the kitchen. I've never had anything less than perfect and they have a pretty big menu for such a small kitchen. Their servers are all really helpful and charismatic. Their hostesses could use some math lessons because they say the wait is going to be an hour or longer and then we are always seated within fifteen. Signature bar drinks can seem a bit pretentious, but bartenders have no problem making the drinks you actually want. In summary, this is my favorite place in Charlotte right now.  Fav dishes: Dirty South Nachos and Pork Belly Tacos. Both phenomenal and not to be missed.",

    "text": "Some places just feel comfortably right. Soul Gastrolounge in Charlotte's Plaza Midwood is one of those places. In the funky second floor rectangle that once hosted potty-mouthed comedy shows at The Perch, exposed brick and beams invite diners to settle in for cozy consumption.  Shouldn't all meals be small plates of surprising complementary textures and flavors? A little taste of babaganoush, blue cheese stuffed mini burgers, a wee bite of manchego, some sushi, and skewer of curried lamb with mango chutney is tapas as it is meant to be: plates large enough for sharing or not, and portions that are satisfying and delicious. Daily cupcake specials and house made goat cheese ice cream for dessert round out the menu.   Service is impressive and personal from employees who exude pierced urban cool. When one diner in our party was unsure of which red wine she'd like, the bartender offered tastes of his top three favorites and let her choose the best for her palate from those while our table was readied. Dishes are delivered to tables as their kitchen preparation is completed, and sampling each dish as they arrive is encouraged.  Close quarters are remedied with booths for larger groups, two and four top tables, bar service and couches and chairs at just the right height for coffee table sharing. Outdoor dining is also available on the balcony overlooking the intersection of Central and Pecan Avenues and the Queen City's skyline at this laidback gastronomic retreat.",

    "text": "I'm claustrophobic and loud music bugs me. Yet I'm still willing to give Soul 5 stars because it's just that good.   I've been here several times and have not yet gotten past my menu indecisiveness. At other restaurants, I will narrow it down to 2, maybe 3 things, and then just go on gut instinct when the server arrives. However, at a recent dinner with a friend, we both found ourselves flipping pages back and forth, almost unable to make up our minds. (Indecisiveness loves company, it would seem.)  Though I tried to resist the temptation, I ended up going with my usual, the Mini Burgers. Holy pickle on a stick, that is a good burger. I also got a Spider Roll, and at the last minute, I threw on an order of eel Nigiri, just in case. My server double checked to make sure I was hungry enough for all that food, and indeed, I was.   All of the food was, as always, spectacular, but I have never seen such slices of eel in all my life. They were like salmon filets, they were so big, and the minuscule seaweed strip couldn't even hold them onto their tiny rice beds. As soon as they arrived I understood my servers skepticism. Still, I found room.   My friend enjoyed his falafel pita immensely, and we made good on the trio of spreads.  His cupcake (the night's special, Kahlua cake with Bailey's icing and chocolate chips) was divine, though I was a little full to steal as much of it as I could have.  Oh how I wish the space were bigger, but Spring will soon be here and the patio will add more seating. And while loud DJ tunes may not be best for 2 friends who haven't talked in awhile, it did make it easier for us to talk about the people next to us without them getting suspicious. Yep, I'm sticking with my 5 stars, and I'll be back again, music and all.",

I'd tried once shortly after it opened and the wait was over an hour for a table - so we left because we figured we would wait until the hype died down to try the place.  I tried again a month or two after opening and during on a weekday when I was quoted 45 minutes to wait for a table - so we went to the bar and ordered a drink. After we realized the host had not asked for names and had no rhyme or reason for picking people from the bar to be seated, we left again.  I tried about 2 weeks ago on a Sunday to get an early dinner. We were actually seated (what a miracle), however the service was absolutely terrible. The server came and brought drinks then vanished. We waited for 25 MINUTES in hopes the server would come back to our table to take our food order - but he didn't. So we got up and left.  I've given up. There is no way the restaurant is worth that many attempts to get a table or worth the complete lack of service from the last visit.",

    "text": "Huxley and I tuckered in, situating ourselves cross-splayed at one of the dark-wood tables lining the near wall of Soul's narrow upstairs veranda. She slowly lowered her sunglasses and thumbed back a wayward strand of her salted, birch-blond bangs. She squinted to the morning light diffusing in through the muddled plastic of the zipper-tent enclosing the balcony. \"It's a such a gorgeous day,\" she said. \"It stings.\" I nodded. It was a spectacular February morning, bright, clean and full up with that heavy brisk that forms in the hours just before the cold air of lingering night completely gives way to the warm mug of day. I ran my hands across my face. I looked up to Hux's squinted eyes, her splotchy cheeks, her ragged clumps of unwashed hair. We shared a commiserating smile.  Presently, our waitress approached - a rangy sprite, narrow and straight, with a black bob, olive skin, and the most adorable pair of black-framed lenses perched atop her strong nose. Quintessential midwood mistress, quirky and divine.  She absconded to fetch our coffee, and Hux and I reflected: Soul is two restaurants in one. At night, it's a swarming lounge, swollen with music and laughter and flavor and abated light. Tapas dance cruel and sushi rolls mean and the pork-belly tacos punch you right in the gut. But for me, it's the drinks, dear god, the Basil Smashes and the red red wines, they flow so fast and so readily, and it's impossible not to, in an instant, drink yourself drunk. Soul, at night, is not a restaurant to be dined casually. It's a force to reckon; it's a bright hot swill. And if you let it, it'll always take you where you want to be. But then there's that other Soul. That once a week daylight binge, the Sunday brunch, the counterpoint to your drunk drunk nights. Haggard with heads low and eyes tight and feet ashuffle, skittering down the cracked sidewalk, all the denizens of the late-night world awake and wander together, inexorably drawn here, to this place, this dazzling place, that opens itself up to us in its most vulnerable hours to feed our faces with the most glorious menu of hang-over spurnables your wasted mind could imagine.  Our waitress returned with our coffee and cream. I delighted. Huxley ordered the scrambled egg pierogies; I went with the shrimp and grits.  We sipped our brew, strong, warm and rich, for a bit, until, in too little time, our waitress returned. \"So...\" she began, \"the kitchen is a little out of sorts this morning...  we're out of pierogies.\"  \"That's fine,\" Hux said, so sweet and demure. \"I'll have the mac and cheese.\" We soaked up the warming air and forced our eyes to let in a little more of the morning light. I turned sideways in my chair and leaned my head and shoulders back against the brick wall. I looked up and admired the amber light seeping from the antique sconces stationing the upper perimeter. \"I love this place,\" Huxley said, gazing dream-faced out into the steadily enlivening miasma of Central ave.  I smiled. \"Me too.\"  \"Can we order mimosas?\" I glanced down at my watch; it was ten to noon. \"Nope, not yet.\"  Our waitress returned with our plates: I was presented with a magnificently arranged tray set upon with fried building blocks of sweet southern grits, smothered in shrimp and andouille and a spicy cream; Hux was handed a messy little cast-iron bowl of corkscrew macaroni drenched in hot white cheddar and topped with bacon and chive, and it was all the best and worst things she or I could desire.  Our hearts swelled and our throats filled up and we salivated like wild, unfettered things. Without care or consideration, we devoured. Savory delights not fit for any creatures such as ourselves, not on that morning, not after that night, but that's what Soul brunch is... that's what it does. It fixes you, it heals you, it restores in you whatever semblances and sensibilities the previous night had taken away. It fills you full, deep and complete, with exactly what you need.  The waitress returned, two tall cylinders of nectar in hand, and placed them on the table. \"Sorry about the pierogies,\" she said. \"These are on the house.\"  I gaped, I gawked, I mooned those two glasses. Juice and champagne, a marriage of substances not easily rivaled, the crowning gesture of an exceptional morning. \"Mimosas...\" I said in a slur. I let the sound roll round my mouth and spill purposefully from my lips. \"Mimosas.\" I spit and I toiled and let myself get all riled up with it. \"Mimosas!\"  Hux reached out and put her hand on my wrist. \"Calm down.\"  I grinned, a jackal, and threw back half my glass, the bubbly sweet and acid all so perfect together, so perfect in my mouth. I looked down at Hux, that girl, that vision, her and all her colors, opaline and prismatic, that oval face, the curves of those crazy lips, and that hair there just dancin', blowin'. \"No, you calm down,\" I said to her.  The quirky waitress got a really good tip.",

    "text": "Soul \"I feel so hip right now\" Gastrolounge.  This is not a place for \"soul food,\" so don't let that portion of the name fool you.  It is the place to go for a WIDE variety of smaller, tapas style plates.  There is something here for the adventurous and the plainest of palates.    Plan to wait, upwards of 2 hours if you go on a weekend night.  I have pretty smart friends, so we came here at 7:30 on a Wednesday night and had nary a problem getting a table (with a 6 top).  We decided to order drinks at the bar while waiting on our last guest.  I was feeling crazy, and ordered a bloody mary (Absolut Peppar).  Bartender asked if I had ever tried a gin bloody mary.  I hadn't, and he gave me a sample.  I will stick to my vodka, but it was an awesome gesture. My liver says, \"thanks.\"  The food comes out as it is ready, so don't be shy to start eating if your friends haven't gotten their food yet.  Just dig in, people.  Per Nicole W's 5/5 review, I ordered the Shrimp Ceviche.  It was tasty, but I don't know that I'd order it again. The plantain chips were sweet and crunchy.  The perfect addition.  Cheese Plate- I feel sorry for vegans.  This was excellent.  My only qualm is that our server did not tell us what cheese was what, came from what kind of mammal, etc.   Lamb Lollipops-Fab.  I love these suckers, pun intended.  Dolmades-I am spoiled in this department and partial to Kabob's.    Rocket Antipasto- Great for sharing.  I could really taste the balsamic, which makes me happy.  I came here last summer I think it was and they had a hush puppy stuffed with warm pimiento cheese.  It was heaven.  Please bring those to the regular menu!!  Soul is a fun, tasty place!",

I will try again however because it has a cool, fun atmosphere and there are plenty of other things to try.",

Completely dominated most Asian places I've been and does so with a totally chill laid back hipsterish vibe- exposed wood ceilings, chill music, cool people. Its location is up a random metal staircase  on a corner of a kinda weird area so you won't stumble upon it- you gotta know its there. And it's there. And it's spectacular. The only bias here for me is I'm greek and so is an owner- even though I didn't get anything greek there are a ton of Greece influenced dishes onthe menu- when I come back next quarter I can't wait to try them.",

    "text": "I have only one complaint. This place is popular - people know about their daily drink specials, their eclectic menu, and friendly service, full of suggestions and refills... and being that I wait tables myself, I am hardpressed not to leave the moment I've finished my meal and the place starts filling up. I'd LIKE to sit and stay for several more drinks but my inner-server tugs on my sleeve, telling me to get goin' and let the people make their money (not THEIR servers, though.)   Where do I start? Went with my boyfriend and roommate one Monday, arrived fairly early, around 6pm, and the server told us about the specials and I ended up grabbing their flatbread special after I heard the words \"crab\" and \"arugula.\" I LOVED THIS DISH. The crab/arugula/lemon vinaigrette/candied garlic combo is genius, I could eat it out of a tub. It would be just as good as a salad, with more arugula, of course.   My roommate, who isn't altogether very picky or adventurous, ordered the sliders and cleaned his plate. My boyfriend and I shared the hamachi and jalapeno, which is super fresh, has a pretty presentation, and the accompanying sauce is right on point for the fish.   I drank their sparkling sake, sparking rose, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, the boys had Newcastles, and we were satisfied overall with their selection. I might have ordered beer if their selection was better. I could use some more microbrews, seasonal stuff, etc. The sake is ok, the rose is good, and the Sauvignon Blanc was good. Nothing to write home about. I sampled the new Greek wine they hadn't put on the menu after ordering an Assyrtiko blend that was on the menu, but it wasn't for me, and the server graciously agreed that she may not have wanted an entire glass of it, either. Makes you more comfortable when a server agrees with your dislike of something, so I appreciated it.   I love the warm ambiance, the coziness, and though I've only been there once, I could tell that many others love this place, too. It's moderately priced (well, pretty cheap, actually, if you're used to eating out fairly regularly,) and the three of us spent $80 (tip not included) on snacks and bunches of drinks, including a couple glasses of wine and a small-ish bottle of sake ($12.)    Definitely close to 5 stars for what it is -- a cool little gastropub.",

    "text": "We stopped in Charlotte for a night on the way back to NYC and were excited to try this restaurant based on all the amazing reviews. When we first got there, we were intrigued by the decor and atmosphere and didn't mind the wait (initially told it was going to be up to 1.5 hours, but that it could be much shorter). We left our phone number with the host and went to the bar next door for a drink. 45 minutes later, we called to check on our reservation and were told that they supposedly texted us 10 minutes prior as our table was ready (we did not get any texts). Either way, we came back and were promptly seated...albeit with only one menu for the four of us (I had to grab one myself from another table). This is when things really started going downhill, which is a shame because most of the food was pretty good.  We all ordered drinks, but only two eventually arrived. We had to remind about the other two 20 minutes later when we realized nothing else was on its way. Then they continued to randomly bring out our tapas dishes without any thought to the order and with very long breaks in between. One of us didn't get any of her four orders for over 30 mins and had to watch others eat. There were two orders of grilled cheese and they came out 45 minutes apart after we inquired about the second one. They completely forgot a dish until we inquired about it at the end of our meal. Bone marrow was undercooked (they comped it on the bill without us saying anything about it, so we assume they knew). Our main waiter didn't remember anything any of us ordered and some orders were getting brought over by different people. Worst of all, we didn't receive much of an apology throughout the ordeal. All we got was a  dismissive \"it's that kind of night.\"  This is a real shame because this is a unique restaurant and lamb lollipops, sashimi, and tuna tacos were great. I recommend the bone marrow or the grilled cheese. But at these prices, this type of service is really unacceptable at an establishment that has been open for a while and has had time to work out the kinks.",

To say I am disappointed in this place would be an understatement. The restaurant was nearly empty yet they refused to make any attempt to sit us together or accommodate our party in any way. We offered to sit half in the lounge and half at the bar until more lounge seating opened up. We offered to sit outside despite the colder weather if they would put a couple tables together (it was completely empty outside). The host made a couple excuses and tried to sit us in 3 groups with 3 different waiters which defeats the whole purpose of dining together. The manager/owner flat out told us \"if we didn't like it we could leave\".  He was completely rude and unprofessional for no reason, totally unprovoked. We walked across the street to The Workman's Friend Irish pub/restaurant and they were fabulous. Friendly, accommodating, delicious food, & great service.  Will NEVER go to Soul Gastrolounge again but would highly recommend The Workman's Friend!  Side note there is ZERO parking for this restaurant",

    "text": "tl;dr: GET THE ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS WITH WATERMELON SALSA!!!!!  More notes: Only reason I took off a star is because they don't take reservations and seating is limited. Show up when they open (5pm) or be prepared for a long wait. We've waited 30 minutes on a Friday night before.   Made the mistake of going on a Saturday night around 7pm and they told us the wait was going to be 2-2.5 hours. That's insane. We tried to wait for a seat at the bar, but it was too packed and you'd practically have to get in a fist fight with other couples waiting for the same thing. We ended up placing our order to go- the bartender was super nice about this, gave us water with cucumber slices while we waited, and was very friendly. The menu is small plates, and I have always been with my husband and we order anywhere from 3-5 to share.   Since this review is skewing negative, let me get to the positive. ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS WITH WATERMELON SALSA!!!!! This is all you need to order. In fact, this may be all you need to eat again for the rest of your life. This menu item should be trademarked. As we were eating them, eyes closed in ecstasy, I wondered who the chef was behind these tacos. They cannot possibly be paying him or her enough. These tacos are seemingly simple. They are small flour tortillas topped with exactly 3 cubes of the Asian glazed pork belly and 3 cubes of watermelon \"salsa\", which is really just watermelon in some sort of vinegary marinade. I am seriously not doing these justice right now. I don't even love pork all that much, but I will always order these- they are life-changing. For frame of reference, That time we got the to-go order we ordered 4 orders of the pork belly tacos, 2 for each of us. Didn't give the rest of the menu a second glance.  We have eaten at Soul a handful of times now, tried various other things on the menu. We tried the sushi, it's fine. We tried the bone marrow, for fun, and that was cool and tasty. But we always come back to those tacos. They might be my death-row last meal sort of choice. The combination of sweet, salty, sour, crunchy....I am drooling just thinking about these, days later.   Oh, the cocktails are also good. :)",

Ham and manchego cheese on toast - they give you a whole slice of cheese, wrapped in ham, on a crostini - it was wonderful   Lamb Lollipops - good, a little pricey, but worth it if you enjoy lamb.   Beef skewers with chimichurri sauce - the chimichurri sauce tasted like blended parsley - t wasn't very flavorful but the beef was marinated well.   Dip trio - hummus, baba ganoush, and tzaziki sauce. The tzaziki sauce was great, the hummus was well prepared, and the baba ganoush was okay. Will not order again.   They ran out of a lamb lollipop (since they are supposed to come in threes) so we received the cupcake of the day. I couldn't figure out what the flavor was, but it was great!

Everyone from the hostesses whispering to each other (who needs 2 hostesses in a restaurant with less than 15 tables anyhow??) to our haughty waitress made me feel judged. I'm willing to admit it's totally a personal problem, but I just felt uneasy and uncomfortable all night.   As I mentioned, the food was good -- and surprisingly affordable -- but I'm not convinced it's worth the wait and attitude you have to deal with. We had the dirty south nachos (great), shells and cheese (good), brussel sprouts (good) and Korean wings (tasted burnt, below average). I'm not sure I want to dissuade anyone from trying Soul if you're curious but I doubt I'll ever be back. So, by all means, if you want to test your cool quotient, pay them a visit. ;) There's just way too many great, non-hipster restaurants nearby -- Bistro La Bon, Dish, Fern -- for me to give them another chance.",

We logged onto Nowait at 6:30 and it said a 2 hour wait, so we went to the hostess and asked how long to eat outside. We were told it will be an hour wait for an outdoor table, so we agreed to that. Two hours later and still no table, so we go back, and we're told it will be 30 minutes. I asked if it would actually be 30 minutes, and she said yes. Needless to say, after 3 hours of waiting, it was still a \"30 minute wait\". We have eaten at Soul several times in the past, and the food has always been very good but the service always lacked. In the past, the food has made up for the service; however; after our most recent experience, I'm not sure if we'll ever be back. There are too many other great places to eat in Charlotte these days.",

We all secretly only like the skin on fried chicken..and they serve it to you on a plate covered in nacho topping goodness. We tried a few other tapas, all which were tastey. But really, get the nachos.   If I ever find myself back in Charlotte, I'll be here.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place! I've only been here twice but it's practically perfect every time. I kinda want to give it 5 stars but I rarely do that unless something extraordinary happened. As for Sol, it's good. Very good. The food, cocktails, atmosphere and music are on point. The vibe is very cosmopolitan and I love that. I feel like I'm at a spot in New York when I'm there. I wish there were more places in CLT with this cosmo vibe.  My second visit was recent. I ate at the bar and the bartenders while cordial weren't very talkative so I pulled a member of the staff who was just walking by and asked him for recommendations. He wasn't even my server but he eagerly stopped and spent a good bit of time with me to offer several suggestions. His name is Drew and he was fantastic!  I had their version of the Moscow Mule to drink. They have a different name for it. I can't remember what they call it but it's damn good. I also had the pork belly tacos, goat cheese balls, and chocolate bread pudding for dessert. Every item was cooked to perfection. Literally mouthwatering.  My only con is that the place is really small. Apparently the wait can be off the chain. I went 30 mins after they opened and there was already a wait but I was by myself so I snagged the one open seat at the bar and it was perfect.   Also it's pricey. All the items are tapas. By the time you order a few plates and drinks, you will have already racked up a hefty tab but it's well worth it.  Love love love this place and highly recommend it, especially if you have friends in town. That way, you can show them what a cool kid you are :) I can't wait to go back....but it will need to be for a special occasion or a splurge.",

    "text": "I absolutely adore Soul. For our first date my now boyfriend said I could pick anywhere in the city so I turned to a seasoned local for suggestions and Soul was the perfect choice. I love the concept of the tapas bar where everything comes out as it is ready. You can linger over plates and rest assured they are as fresh as possible and haven't been sitting under a light while the rest of the meal cooks. If you particularly enjoyed a plate, or are still hungry you can easily order more. As a first date spot it is trendy with delicious and very strong cocktails, and allows you to review important sharing attitudes. Does he give you the last sashimi taco? These things are important in a potential mate!   Next time I go I think I am just going to order several plates of the sashimi tacos.  They are beyond amazing marinated raw tuna in a fried wonton shell. Hands down my favorite dish in Charlotte.  Their sushi rolls are all tasty and reasonably priced for the size they provide. The pork in their pork belly tacos is super tender and the sauce on it is perfect (though I remove the watermelon from mine it just doesn't work for me). If you are feeling adventurous the bone marrow and toasts is a great flavor combination.   Soul can be affordable or it could be pricey. Their sushi rolls are large so you could make one a dinner if you wanted. The price spikes rapidly when you order several plates, or just one more of your favorite. The cocktails are about the price you would expect for the area, but they are shockingly strong. So in the end I actually think they are quite the deal.   Everything I have tried at Soul has been so delicious and the staff is very friendly. The only complaint I have with Soul is the wait time is underquoted. If you go during the week it shouldn't be too bad but last time we went was on the weekend and we were quoted an hour wait, but it took two full hours to get to our table. Being off by an hour is a pretty huge miscalculation. Only for you, Soul, will I wait so long for a table.   If you go on the weekend I would advise checking in and going to a nearby bar. They will text you when your table is ready.",

We got there just in time (around 6:20pm on Friday) - while waiting to be seated the wait time for 2 people went from 10 minutes (us) to one hour (angry couples after us).  Overall though, I wasn't that impressed with the food or drink. I love a good, innovative craft cocktail, but there menu was just a little bit too weird for me. My drink came with lavender foam on it. Lavender foam. It was a lovely drink once you got past the taste of your grandmother. The Goose thought his take on an old-fashioned tried too hard as well. I stuck to the punch after that, which was decent.  The small plates food was alright but did not meet my high expectations. The dip trio and cheese plate were nice starters, but I thought the pita and bread were too crispy and hard to bite. My salmon-o-pita sounded good in there but was just alright. I believe the Goose enjoyed his sliders.  The dinner ended with Goose suggesting we go home and make cocktails that we actually enjoyed. I guess Soul was just a little too funky for us!",

Many of the dishes that I tried are very rich, so you definitely benefit from being able to sample around. The dirty south nachos and the shells and cheese were my two favorites. Only downside is that it is pretty easy to run up a large tab when you're ordering multiple drinks and multiple small plates.",

    "text": "Went to soul tonight for the second time. First time was 5 years ago and I had great memories of the food especially the cheesy pork belly pasta shells. I wanted to make my way back before writing a review. Came here with my girlfriend for her birthday. Checked in to the waiting list on yelp (this is a must). Seated fairly quickly and got to ordering. Our waiter Aaron was extremely nice and did a great job getting our food out and never missing a beat. We ordered fried meatballs, stuffed pasta shells, fried goat cheese bruschetta, spicy feta dip, and tuna tacos. We didnt have a plate in front of us we didnt like. Shells and goat cheese bruschetta were definitely our favorites. This place is totally unique as well. There isn't a ton of seating which gives it quite a wait but it also gives it a special vibe. Decor is pretty interesting. Theres even a peacock on the wall. Cant wait to be back. Oh and they have Narraganset 16oz for 4 dollars so you can get trashed on a budget.",

The food is high quality as well as the cocktails. Atmosphere is defiantly busy and you must try there Moscow mules. I personally think this is the best restaurant in Charlotte hands down. You won't walk out disappointed at all. Personally the lamb chops you just can't go wrong with. However I have not had one bad thing out of this place and look forward to returning as a loyal customer. Please tip my hat to the chef and keep cooking that great food!",

Solid food, great drinks, and cool vibes.  What's not to love.  The pork belly tacos are probably the best known item on the menu.  I am definitely a fan.  The tuna tacos are pretty tasty as well.  The lamb lollipops are great, but not a whole lot of food per dollar compared to some other items on the menu.  Similar with the mushrooms on toast.  I don't if I've actually had anything bad here.  Check this place out at least for a quick drink, a Moscow Mule on tap perhaps, but stay for some snacks as I think you will enjoy them.",

My favorite dishes from the menu include the flatbread, the lamb lollipops, the tuna tacos, the eggplant parmesan skewers, and the cheese plate. I've also tried multiple cocktails and have enjoyed all of them - the mule is my favorite, perfectly refreshing. The chocolate brioche bread pudding for dessert is absolutely incredible and an excellent way to end the meal.  Soul has a very cozy atmosphere and few tables, so make sure to arrive early if you don't want to wait. It's crowded both on weekends and on weekdays, but it's worth the wait. This place is perfect for a date night or for a night out with friends, and it's one of my favorite spots in Charlotte!",

Oh well, let's take this logically from the start!   Walking into Soul kind of like walking into this darkly lit rustic speakeasy with a trendy twist to it all. It's old school with a touch of contemporary. The seating inside makes for a great date night setting or a fun night out with a good group of friends. There's outdoor seating on the patio as well which is what my girlfriend and I did. The weather was perfect and it had a nice bustle out there which was much appreciated. To complement this unique setting is the staff - everyone with their own unique personality and equally amazing. Our waiter was super fun and had great recommendations for us on not just food at Soul but also in the Charlotte area. And for a Yelper/ Foodie like me, I thrive off local recommendations. we genuinely enjoyed his company, so much so we held him in conversation and stopped him from even getting to his other tables. Oops?   On to the food! And I'm gonna get straight to the point. Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos. They are everything. That is all.   No but seriously just get them because you won't regret it one bit. The flavoring was a perfect tangy sweet and sour and the watermelon added a very interesting touch to the profile.  I'm not that big of a pork belly fan to begin with so y'all I'm serious haha. I also had the Tuna tacos which were also great and my girlfriend had the flatbread which she thoroughly enjoyed. As for the drinks and cocktails - very well made and crafted with attention to detail. They're a little pricey but totally worth it. Try the Sidecar Named Desire!   I'll definitely be going back soon to try the rest of the fantastic menu - I got my eyes on those short ribs!",

The saganaki was awesome and the red dragon sushi roll was absolutely on point but I will say left thinking that it didn't matter what I ordered beverything on the menu would be good.   2- don't do what I did and wait four years to finally try this place!",

The pork belly tacos were very good, but not crave-worthy. Both our drinks were...fine... but not memorable. The lamb lollipops were the most disappointing and were incredibly bland. The chicken nachos were interesting. Not what we were expecting at all, but flavor was pretty good. The pickled okra garnish was maybe our favorite part. In the end, we decided to not get anything else even though we were both still hungry, and instead left to get more food somewhere else. I think this place is more about the vibe and the hype than actual flavor. Service was friendly, but food was average for Charlotte.",

While it IS very small, I can see why it takes so long to be seated: it's not a normal restaurant where one would order their meal, have it delivered, eat it, and then leave. No, not at Soul. Once we were seated we ordered a round of tapas... which did come out rather quickly... ate them... decided we wanted to order more... and more. This is a process in itself. Our group of 4 agreed on 3-4 dishes at a time, probably totalling 8-10 tapas and 2 cupcakes during our visit. Soul is known for their sushi, but I personally thought the lamb skewers, brussel sprouts, pork tacos and fried clams (the special) were my personal favorites. Sadly I woke up in the middle of the night with a HORRIBLE stomach ache- a lot of fried food, and while it comes in small portions, it is deceiving. Beware. We have been eating a lot of meatless/healthy/raw lately, so don't let the size of the tapas fool you. That stuff is heavy. Ah- and how can I forget the fried goat cheese? It was divine. No wonder my stomach hated me last night. :)",

    "text": "As always when I come home to visit my folks in Charlotte I am faced with the dilemma of finding restaurants to eat out at that not only tease my palate with some new flavors but also manage to not scare them off in the process. It's usually just my mom dining with me, so that relieves some of the pressure of pleasing all 3 of us, which is truly an unenviable task. This time around I solicited the feedback of a few fellow Yelpers in Charlotte for some new places and decided Soul Gastrolounge offered up so many options on their menu that surely I could find something to satisfy us both.  It seemed to me that most of the complaints people had with this place revolved around the wait to get in, or just poor service in general, but I can definitely assure you we had neither of these problems (although mom likes to eat dinner early, so we got there a little after 6PM). In fact our server Marlon was one of the most attentive I've ever had, and constantly updated us on the progress of our items, since we ordered so many different plates. The pace of the food was all done well, and only at one point was our table completely overflowing with dishes, to which we just stole some space from the one next to us for a few minutes. All of the drinks came out within just a few minutes of ordering as well. Maybe we just got lucky, but this service was on point the whole night.  At first glance the huge menu here seems to be a total mishmash of things from all over the globe, prepared in every way imaginable, the kind of thing that Gordon Ramsay would come into a restaurant and blow a gasket over. After a little further examination though you can see some of the connections, although I still think they should do away with a few sections altogether and focus more on the remaining dishes. The pricing of everything here (with the exception of the $18 lamb lollipops) is all pretty fair though, so you can try just about anything on the menu without a huge investment, a nice departure from the \"small plate\" pricing schemes in DC.  We began with their spicy feta dip, which had a nice thick texture but I couldn't get past the strong Pimento cheese flavor, something that quickly reminded me I was back in NC. I did like it, but not sure I would recommend it. Next out were the Boursin cheese stuffed piquillo peppers served over mini-bruschettas. The flavors here were a bit muted for me, something my mom was a fan of, but I guess that's due to my inexperience with piquillos and expecting them to be spicy rather than sweet. So, if that's more your style then this dish is definitely done properly. The last of our teaser bites was easily my favorite, the French fries with garlic-herb salt and truffle oil, and we wound up snacking on them throughout the whole meal as a nice base point for flavors when we wanted to alternate back and forth. The truffle presence is pretty potent here but the herb flavors do a good job balancing it...definitely request some of the spicy mayo for dipping!  Our first meat dish to come out was the chimichurri beef skewers, really well cooked cubes of beef with a hint of pink and a side of dipping sauce. Thankfully the chimichurri was for dipping, because it was a big disappointment compared to other versions I've had, but at least the meat was good. The sticky veal shortribs with the five spice honey glaze though were superb. The meat falls right off the bone as it should and maintains tenderness throughout. I really loved the traditional Asian flavor combo of hoisin and five spice here too. The lamb lollipops are clearly the star of the show here, although I wish the rosemary flavor was a bit more pronounced...and I hardly ever say this, but they cooked have been cooked just a bit longer to get a nice sear on the outside.  My favorite dish came next, the pork belly tacos with watermelon salsa. We were worried they wouldn't be available, as our waiter told us there was currently a watermelon shortage, but someone managed to find some and deliver it to the restaurant just in time, whew. Glad they did, as this was a unique flavor combination for me that really worked brilliantly. The high didn't last long though, as I was thoroughly disappointed with the shrimp ceviche, mainly due to the coconut milk base which was entirely too sweet.  Dessert was a mixed bag, with the eggnog cupcake being OK, thanks in part to a heavy dose of rum-spiked frosting, and the pistachio ice cream being much better. There are nice big pieces of whole pistachios mixed into the ice cream which not only enhanced the flavor but added a nice textural element.  I really appreciated the effort they're putting into the cocktail menu here as well. At just $10 a piece you can get some pretty creative combinations, such as the Dark N' Spicy using dark rum, ginger liqueur, Saranac ginger beer and fresh lime juice, much better than the \"Stormy\" version. Basil Smash was also good, but the Sweet Heat had too much syrup and not enough kick.",

    "text": "This place has got soul! Too cheesy? It's okay just keep reading it gets better I promise. I just had to! Originally this was going to be a 5 star review but after a prompt return visit the hostess's bitchiness and ineptitude caused me to take away a star. More on that later. Buckle up kids this is going to be a long review.  I probably have to give Soul the award for some of the most creative and tastiest cuisine I've ever had in Charlotte. Yes it's that good. Even when you order something that sounds fairly normal, they managed to give it a creative twist. I'm so appreciative of that! The interior is very small, crowded and very loud. So be prepared for a long wait sometimes, especially since they don't take reservations. But the staff is nice without being over the top, and water refills are kept up. I especially like that they serve it with cucumber instead of the usual lemon. I never like the taste of lemon in water, but I do love the flavor a slice of cucumber can infuse!  My first trip here I went with tuna sashimi tacos, an amazing duck confit pasta topped with crispy sweetbreads and foie gras, and grilled toast topped with wild mushrooms and a fried egg with a Dijon vinaigrette. Finished with last but not least goat cheese ice cream. This meal contained probably some of the best things I've ever eaten anywhere in Charlotte.   Lets start with the tuna tacos, I've had something similar to this dish while I was in Cali, it was a deconstructed fish taco and so I was excited to find it here! It did not disappoint at all! The guacamole was flavorful and added dimension and fattiness to the tuna while the fried wonton wrapper gave it a lovely crunch, yum.  Next up came the duck confit pasta, now if the last dish was awesome this would qualify as a masterpiece. The duck confit paired with the delivered such amazing flavors that this dish could have easily fit into a high class restaurant. The foie gras' earthiness and richness complemented the pasta and gave it amazing depth of flavor, while the crispy sweetbreads brought the whole dish together some much needed texture. This dish is best eaten in small amounts though because it had such a rich, luxurious mouthfeel I felt quite sated after finishing half of the plate.  The last savory course of the evening was grilled wild mushrooms with a dijon vinaigrette over charred toast and topped with a fried egg. I wasn't even going to get this dish because I was quite full but I saw the table next to us get it and I had to have it. I thought this dish was the most balanced of the night with complex flavors and textures melding together in glorious harmony. Just get the thing and you'll be singing it's praises too.  Feeling like an overstuffed plush at this point, I decided to go all in and order the goat cheese ice cream. You could taste the grassiness of the goat cheese and the ice cream felt surprisingly low fat which surprised me. I think I'd prefer it if the flavor kicked me in the face next time like *WHAM* that's goat cheese alright! and maybe make the ice cream a bit more decadent? I just feel like you want to go all out for dessert and this let me down a bit.  The music here is very very very loud. I couldn't hear what my dining partner about a foot away was saying, I almost contemplated just texting each other across the table. The hostess the first time was perfectly nice, but my second time was so rude, unfriendly, and nasty that I just took my business elsewhere. For such excellent food though I'll brave all these missteps and take my chances.",

We started out with the short ribs and Korean BBQ...perfectly done!  Moved on to the porkbelly with watermelon tacos...also done to perfection!  The spicy with cool watermelon works well together.  We then ordered sushi and had Gidzilla roll and dragon roll...five stars!  I highly recommend this place for adults...not a kid place for sure...is very small and not reall suitable for strollers and whatnot. We will be back for sure!!!",

    "text": "I'm new to Charlotte but this place has become one of my favorite lounge spots!! I decided to try this place out when a friend and I were looking for somewhere to go in the Charlotte area on a Friday night and we were both entirely over the typical club scene. We decided to check them out after reading some reviews online and we were not disappointed!! The food is awesome and very reasonably priced. The sushi is very popular here. The drinks aren't that strong, at least not to me, but I'm somewhat of a \"drinker\" so take that for what it's worth. Service was great. Our waiter took time to go over the menu with us and point out some of the more popular and highly recommended dishes. He was really patient and nice and he even brought me a free glass of wine from the bar. I have no idea why but I didn't question it! The only downside to this place is that it's really small but very popular so depending on what time you arrive, you may find yourself waiting for a long time to be seated. We arrived around 10pm and were told there would be a 45 minute wait. We were able to find a small space at the bar to hang out and ended up ordering a few drinks and some of their AMAZING Garlic fries while we waited. This place probably wouldn't be the best spot to take a large group of people but they do have group seating areas that can accommodate a small group of 5 or 6. Parking was free and close to the building so we didn't have to walk far.   If you decide to check it out it's a must you try the Garlic fries....by far the best fires I've ever had! I'd also recommend the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos (different but awesome), the Sushi Fondu, and the Korean BBQ Soul Wings.",

    "text": "To sum things up in a tidy little sentence:  Soul has a swanky vibe, indoor and outdoor seating, great service, and fantastic food/beverage selection.   My boyfriend and I headed over to Soul on a random Sunday night just after 5pm in order to get one of the coveted outdoor tables to enjoy the weather over dinner. We ordered a plethora of options to share, including:    - White bean goat cheese dip with pita points: so good that my boyfriend, who doesn't like goat cheese, devoured it. - Athenian tomato salsa: delicious - I thought it'd just be regular old salsa, but the seasoning was divine.  - Veggie roll: in order to entice my boyfriend into eating sushi, we started with this option, and he really liked it. Looking forward to more adventurous options next time. - Soul roll: this was my dinner roll - delicious with the jalapeno and spicy mayo for a bit of a kick.  - Tuna skewer: sauce that came on this skewer was very good, and it was seared perfectly.  - Chicken pita: great flavor and presentation.  They also make cupcakes in house and change flavors periodically, so be sure to try them all so you don't miss out!  Parking can be a bit tricky in that area, and the place fills up quickly on weekends, so head over there early if you don't want to wait. That said, there's always the bar to try out some of the fun cocktails if you do have to wait a bit - the bartenders at Soul are always friendly!",

Driving up, I was mortified to see that Soul was \"that sketchy place I pointed out last time we went to Dish.\" It's in a building where the downstairs tenant is gone and has been replaced by brown paper window coverings. The building next door has chains on the windows. So it doesn't scream - this is a good idea!  HOWEVER! Once you step into Soul, it's a different world. Very cool decor and trendy crowd. A+ for the atmosphere. Booths, tables, couches, bar, outdoor.. whatever seating arrangement you please.  The wait can be long, but there is an area to sit or you can go outside and wait and they welcome you to visit the bar in the meantime.   The drinks are hit or miss. I was served some \"famous martini\" that I thought may end my life at any moment and didn't have even a hint of goodness to it. Since then, I have avoided what the bartender \"recommends\" and go with what I'm feeling.. so far, much better.  The food is not hit or miss. It's very hit. The lamp lollipops are very memorable. They were my first bite at Soul and are my first bite every other visit. Fried Meatballs - very good. Soul Grilled Cheese - delicious. Skewers - YUM YUM YUM (have had the garlic shrimp, gyro, chicken and beef). \"Soul Original\" suchi rolls - yes, please! And the truffle, garlic, herb, whatever fries - I can not eat enough of those. It's just not possible.   I would definitely recommend a visit to Soul. It is all-around great. I've been on a date night with the boyfriend and taken my mom for a girl's night, been with girlfriends. It's perfect for any dinner outing.",

    "text": "If you've never eaten at Soul Gastrolounge, you may be tempted to dismiss it, but if you do, you may be making the biggest mistake of your foodie life here in Charlotte. While it may not look like much from the outside, and climbing those fire-escape-style steps may look like a hazard, you will be rewarded upon entrance with some of the most delicious, food-forward tastes you will have ever experienced here in the Queen City. Not only is their sushi amazingly fresh and considered some of the best in town on many \"best-of' lists, but the taste combinations are often amazingly radical even for most sushi devotees. Other non-sushi items are also what could be called flavor-wells due to the sheer amount of good tastes contained within. Even though by some standards the menu could be considered small, everything (if you are an adventurous eater) is constructed for what I call \"optimum flavor density\". You know how you can taste several flavors when sampling a glass of wine? When eating at Soul it seems like everything is gauged to make you experience multiple flavor combinations, all of them amazing. Some issues are present that may hinder your enjoyment and one is the restaurant is on the small side and tends to get packed quickly so there may be a wait. Another is the lack of parking in Plaza Midwood, which affects all businesses there, not just Soul. There is no parking specifically for the restaurant, so be careful were you park, many places in the area may tow your car. As long as you educate yourself on your parking options you will be fine but the drugstore across the streets tows as well as others so find a safe place where you can park for a few hours and enjoy your dining experience. This restaurant is amazing.",

    "text": "Second visit! Be warned they don't take reservations so be prepped to either wait or grab a drink in the meantime. Me being the boring individual that I am, I opted for going to grab drinks at the Peculiar Rabbit next door. After all, turn down for what?  We received a text promptly at 7:45 as promised (approx. 45 min wait) and we headed on over. We were given the choice to either sit in a booth or at high top table. Our server arrived immediately to get our drink orders. I had a Moscow Mule (vodka, lime and ginger beer) which was absolutely delicious!   For tapas we got: Rocky Mountain Oysters, lamb lollipops, ahi tuna skewers and the Napoleon roll. Between the tenderness and seasoning the lamb lollipops are definitely a dish I will get again! (Sorry Mary, we ate your lamb). The sesame and soy drizzle on the seared tuna was delicious, I felt like licking the skewers! And the sushi consisted of tuna, cream cheese and jalapenos lightly fried...OMG it was the best sushi roll I've had in a while. Now step lightly with the Rocky Mountain oysters because you might just get tea bagged! No seriously, they are the TESTICLES OF BULL CALVES! These are not for me (I'm a texture person and these were NOT firm to say the least) but rumor is a lot of people enjoy them here routinely...if it wasn't for the ranch...hmm testicles in ranch...yeah I'm going to leave that one there. To each his own!   Overall the food and drinks were absolutely amazing! And the atmosphere dim and intimate, while the elevated music put off a nice vibe! If you're looking for a great time, Soul is where it's at!   You're welcome.",

Picture this: 1) Dimmed lighting that sets a classy-casual vibe mixed with random eclectic decor, such as a giant peacock embracing the brick walls with its luscious feathers  2) Hungry Charlotte-ans filled with laughter as they line up by the bar, drinking and chit-chattering away as they WILLINGLY wait hours for a table 3) Visiting guests who are embodied with anticipation as their minds are brainwashed by locals about how amazing the food is 4) Eager faces and watering mouths as tapas are slowly brought out to their owners  yummm.. makes me drool just reminiscing about the experience and especially my meal! Absolutely everything we ordered had an extra kick or zing that took me by surprise. Every \"normal\" dish offered, or so it was described, had an unexpected twist of flavors.  We ordered Wild Mushrooms On Toast (Panini), Ahi Tuna with Sesame & Soy Drizzle (Skewers), Sashimi Tuna Tacos (Tapas-Meze-Small Plates), Sticky Veal Short Ribs (Tapas-Meze-Small Plates), Soul Roll (Sushi: Soul Originals), Goat Cheese Ice Cream and Pistachio Ice Cream (Soul Made Ice Cream). All this for two little girls who, by the way, finished every last bite! In parentheses are the categories of each item. I would recommend any and all of these dishes, but my absolute favorite is the Sticky Veal Short Ribs! These were the most amazing short ribs I have ever had! The meat was so tender and the flavors oh so rich. The meat slid off the bone with ease and every bite was drenched with flavors!  Aside from the amazing short ribs, I have to say that Soul houses the best Pistachio Ice Cream.. IN THE WORLD! The entire meal was absolutely divine. I can't wait to come back!  TIP: It's located upstairs, above a boutique, and can easily be missed if it's your first time. Be on the look out!",

Would've been better if it had a flavourful hit of garlic to it. Not the best. The pita chips that came with it we nice and healthy (since they were baked not fried).  2. Eggplant Parmesan skewers - This was the best dish I tried in soul! The eggplant and cheese was cut into perfect chunks and breaded and crisped to perfection. The marinara sauce (which I hope was made in the house and not store bought) was great to accompany the dish. All in all perfect! Must try for everyone.  3. Flatbread - Was good. The pesto was delicious although, the honey braised garlic made it somewhat sweet (which is the point) but didn't do anything. If you love cheese and pesto on bread, go for it!  Pita sandwich with falafel - Again, a great dish. Nothing innovative here, but a good soft pita with tomatoes and tender tasty falafels. I liked it! Vegetarians will definitely love this one.   Dessert - chocolate brioche cake with ice cream - Good warm cake with nuts and tasty caramel syrup to moisten it while the ice cream melts! Good dessert!  And after so much food, what we paid was unbelievably reasonable (just $38) ! That's the best part.. it's gourmet food at cheap pricing!   I've been waiting to go to this place since forever. Will definitely go back to try other vegetarian options (and the eggplant parmesan skewers as well) :D",

    "text": "The mentions of waiting and waiting turned me off from coming here for a long time. We went on a Tuesday night around 630p and there was no wait. I think we got lucky considering it had just opened for the night but in the hour we spent there it filled up quickly. Once we got inside I could see why there's usually a wait - the place is small! Our waiter was really nice and came by at just the right times. He suggested we order three plates per person. We ordered the tuna tacos, the flatbread, the wings, the fries and a sushi roll.  Tuna tacos ($11); they come as an order of three. We got 4 instead for an upcharge I'm sure. Why have items come in threes when it's a sharing kind of place? Then someone is a jerk for eating the last one and someone feels like they got shorted one. These were good and I would recommend. They're two bites each.   Flatbread ($10) was dripping with cheese and honey; should just be called a mini pizza. Not very refined and sticky.   Korean wings ($9) were also really sticky. Don't order these unless you want to get up to go wash your hands.  Fries ($6) were like truffle fries at any other place; similar to the ones at Good Food on Montford. Greasy. Skip.  Queen Charlotte Roll ($10) was probably the best part of our meal; 8 pieces, I've had better but at least this was what we expected it to be. We ordered the fresh wasabi to go with this ($5). About a dime sized portion (see picture)  All of the above plus 1 cocktail and 1 beer came to $72. Is this real life? The quantity of food is very disproportionate to the cost. We should have just stuck with sushi because at least the price on the rolls is proportionate to the size of the item. It was okay but I wouldn't come back here. The reason we finally came was because we'd received a gift card from a friend. In theory being able to order items from different cuisines sounds like a good idea but in practice all those foods shouldn't mix. We both felt off afterwards. Save your money and your stomach for someplace else.",

We opted for a table outside since the weather was nice.  I ordered the steak and egg sandwich. Open face sandwich for this one. It didn't look like a big portion, but it was filling.  Also get an order of the truffle fries. One order is enough to share between 2-3 people easy. We got 2 orders between 4 people and could not finish them. Delicious nonetheless.  Also got a side of mushrooms on the side. It was served cold and was pickled.  Nice drink selection as well. Overall, great spot to eat for small plates and to hang out.",

We both enjoyed everything! My favorite was the red dragon roll and I will probably order that every time.   Great spot. So bring a fully charged phone to keep you occupied while you wait (unless the person you are with is someone you've been dating for a few months or less - in that case, talk to them and DON'T mess with your phone) and enjoy :)",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best \"Charlotte\" restaurants. This restaurant is tucked away on the second floor of one of the building on Plaza Midwood's \"main and main\" Focusing only on dinner service, Sould Gastrolounge has a cult-like following in Charlotte and regulars alike. I have never been dissapointed with the food at Soul, and the chef is constantly adding new and innovative dishes to the classics on the menu.   There's not a bad seat in the house but my favorites in order are: outside on the small patio on a nice day, inside at the low couch table if I'm with 3-4 people, and at the DJ bar if I'm with one other person. Don't expect to sit at the bar unless you get there right at 5pm. If you come later than 5pm, expect a short wait. Grab one of the incredible drinks made by the well-informed bartenders and mingle with the other patrons or stand outside on the patio and admire the view of Uptown Charlotte.   There are so many different items to explore on the menu but my \"don't miss\" favorites are: Pork Belly Tacos (order 3), Shells and Cheese (sinfully delicious), Brussel Sprouts (never taste this good when I cook them), Soul Roul (yes, their sushi is GREAT), Ahi Tuna tacos, and the Lamb Lollipops. You're not going to go wrong with this menu, but if you come here and don't order the pork belly tacos you're doing it wrong.",

The atmosphere is very hip, and the patio/balcony dining space was really interesting. The crowd was younger, which made the experience very fun and energetic.  Regardless, the food is definitely worth the wait. We had a sashimi tuna taco, slow-cooked ribs, grilled chicken skewer, and a tuna sushi roll. I would describe the food as the best of East meets West. Especially the ribs and chicken skewer-- the presentation, the taste, dressings, and sauces reminded me a lot of Japan, where every detail matters. So much so that I kept saying the owner's must have lived in Japan for a while, but it turns out the owner is Greek...I was way off!  I would highly recommend the tapas over the sushi. The sushi's really just mediocre.",

Apparently you can ONLY order what is on the menu because the kitchen is very small and they just don't have the means to make things to order.

Sushi is solid, but not earth shattering; it is certainly fresh, and I have to admit that it is nice to have rolls that don't try to throw the kitchen sink into them every once in a while.  Friendly and attentive service as well.  The only real drawback is that they do not take reservations, so be prepared to wait.

Since I've eaten here, oh, I don't know seven or eight times, you think I would have gotten around to it by now. Nope. So, here we are. Months later and I've had many a dish at Soul. The interior is cozy and dark, the staff has always been friendly and helpful while choosing from their extensive menu. Yes indeed it can get crowded, so plan your evening accordingly! Here's the low down on the dishes I've tried:  White Bean & Goat Cheese Dip: 3/5: Tasty white beans mixed into a (cool) creamy goat cheese. Served with snappy little pita chips. I kind of wish it was warm, but the flavors make me come back to it often.   Goat Cheese Crostini: 4/5: Toasty balls of goat cheese atop a lovely crostini piled with tomato and onion. Yum.  Shrimp Ceviche: 5/5: Bangin'. Just damn good. Perfectly prepared and full of flava.   Guacamole Stack: 2/5: Meh. Not bursting with flavor and I'm always searching for some type of carb to pair with this lovely stack of avocado.   Tuna Tacos: 3/5: I love the fresh tuna & the sauce but I dislike the overly fried flavor of the encompassing taco shell.   Soul Roll: 5/5: DELISH. One of my favorite sushi rolls in Charlotte - 'tis flavorful, punchy and super fresh.  Gyro: 2/5: I prefer Showmars, frankly. The meat or mix within the meat tasted sweet?! A bit strange.   Cupcakes: 3.5/5: I've tried two types and had two different reactions. My first was a cookies & cream - it was tasty but dry. Sad face. Then, last night I tried the snickerdoodle cupcake - delicious, not dry whatsoever. Mouth watering cinnamony sugary goodness topped with buttery frosting. Nom.   I know I'll be back to this eclectic eatery soon - there is truly a dish for every bud and tastebud!",

Who is the evil genius behind this??? While there are a few misses the food is good! They lose two stars for spotty service unfortunately On more than two occasions I have visited and been treated like a peasant.  One instance it was super busy and I had eventually ordered drinks at the bar.  The bartender handed me a receipt and pen to sign but there was literally no where to rest the paper to sign with two drinks in my hand and several people just leaning along the bar I found a clear spot at the end of the bar to get it done. I put the drinks down and not even two seconds later I am scolded by some dude organizing receipts or something at the end of the bar saying I can't use the space.  I told him I was just trying to sign and pay and he gave me the Kanye shrug... Another time we my group of four was told we had to wait about an hour for seating at midnight and there were several open tables...we eventually and rebelliously just sat down and were served (surprise surprise no one came to claim the 'reserved' tables) I have a few other similar stories.  Why do I return?  Because the food and drinks are good(and usually I get outvoted). But please work on the service",

There is not one item that didn't blow my taste buds out the box! The only thing I would change is the tzatziki sauce.

We were handed a drink menu and sat down to review it. Once we decided on our drinks, we went to sit at the bar. My friend wanted a mimosa and I wanted to try one of their signature drinks. The bartender described the drink I chose to be bitter so I told him that I would look at the menu again. He then asked to see my friend's ID and looked at it for a couple of minutes. Granted it was a SC ID but easily verifiable. I let the bartender know that I didn't want a drink. He came back and told my friend that he couldn't serve her because he couldn't verify her ID and that I refused to show my ID. I didn't understand why I had to show my ID and I wasn't getting a drink. We ended up talking to a manager but decided to leave. I don't think we would be going back to Soul.",

    "text": "Charlotte's hottest spot for the semi-well to do but not really, is a place called Soul Gastrolounge which is inspired by the gastropubs of European origin that serve small plates and libations all throughout the wee hours of the night.    You'll find everything here, darkness, trendsters, hipsters, scenesters, nerd alerts, creepos, weeaboos, ceos cheating on their wives, questionably bent dudes in pink shirts, cuckqueens and mystic trannies along with a life sized stuff peacoack on the wall that makes for an excellent segue from awkward and potentially friendship ruining topics about butthole worship.    The drinks were excellent, with everything being cucumber infused which refreshes the palate for the next small dish.  Dubs had the hummus which sadly, tasted more bland than a glass luke warm camel's milk but her 2nd choice of meatballs with cream sauce was an excellent dish, except the waitress took away the dip far too early and left me with dry meatballs that was a bit difficult to swallow.    Our baritone voiced waiter who had a voice for radio and a face for the sequel of Arnold's all time smash hit \"Jingle All the Way\", recommended the watermelon & pork soft tacos which was exquisite.  I would recommend eating with a fork and knife because the tortilla, which was about the size of Dub's baby hands, was purely there for \"deckorayshun\".    Last of all, the friend chicken skin pimento cheese nachos was also a winner.  Overall, this is a good place to kick it where service is fast and tables so close together so that the woman sitting next to you can correct you about actually being able to see the July 4th fireworks, when in fact I was right, and you can't see the fireworks.",

As the other Yelp reviewers confirmed, there was at least an hour and a half wait - but they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, which is super convenient if you want to bar hop in the area while you wait.    We only ended up waiting an hour and were seated. We ended up ordering the pork belly tacos, truffle fries, Korean BBQ wings, avocado stack salad, and a sushi roll. Each portion is small and comes out when it is ready.   The pork belly tacos were everything that the previous reviews said they were gonna be - AMAZING. The watermelon added a nice tang to the saltiness of the pork.   The truffle fries were amazing as well. Hot and crispy and seasoned to perfection as any good fry should be.   The avocado stack salad was literally amazing and life changing and everything a avocado loving person like myself would dream of.   The Korean BBQ wings were ok. I'm a fan of spicy food, but this seemed like someone just poured a whole bottle of hot sauce into a bowl, added a dash of Korean seasonings and tossed the wings in there. Wouldn't order again.   The sushi roll was good. I believe it was called the Geisha roll. Could be wrong.   Definitely would come back here, but probably during a weekday when it might not be so busy, in comparison to a Friday or Saturday.",

I would recommend all of them and the Dirty South Nachos are like a dream - planning to recreate at home but a trip back to Charlotte might be in order!  Just a tip for the hosting station: your goal should be  to organize and welcome spending guests, not give such a cold attitude that people think twice about enduring the crazy wait. There is a way to greet and treat people that conveys this goal. Thankfully the food paid off. Take it from someone who has happily waited hours for Toki Underground, you can make or break someone's experience literally right from the door.",

The hostess at the door immediately told me that the kitchen was going to be closing in a couple of seconds and I had better place my order now before they close. I proceeded to the bar to place my order and the bartender rudely asked me \"what I would like to eat\" as if I was wasting his precious time. I felt so disrespected and disappointed after receiving such a great recommendation to visit the restaurant. I have never in my life felt not welcomed in a restaurant I don't think I would ever revisited this restaurant again nor could I recommend it to anyone after the terrible unwelcoming experience.",

    "text": "So, the BEST was the DJ and the food! KUDOS to the DJ and the Chefs!!! For sure, the DJ was ON POINT with his entire set; not one foul song!! Obviously, I can't stop talking about him; he was rockin it (and on a TUESDAY)!!!! The food was delicious! I had sushi and it was ON POINT!!!   The only thing I didn't like was that we asked for a booth but was told booths were for larger parties as was a table in the corner, however, we were allowed to sit in the corner table! That was NO BUENO! Any paying patron should have the option to sit where they want to sit especially if the seating is available - to tell someone that they can't sit anywhere, almost put me in a mind set that there was an underlying reason behind that. It was a Tuesday night....surely they weren't expecting a huge crowd, but I digress.   Altogether, if the seating situation had been better, I would have rated it a 5. For the DJ and bomb food I give it 4 stars and will be back for those two reasons!!!  Revised:  I went there a second time and again the manager seemed nonchalant towards myself and my companion plus I noticed the same type of attitude towards another African American patron; for this reason I changed my rating to below par. If I did not feel such a prejudice undertone it would be much better but because of this reason I will not ever return to this establishment even if the DJ was one of the best I've ever heard...He's not there all the time anyway.",

I think we got there just in time and probably got the last booth. We sat across from a busy and extremely well stocked bar. Our waiter was very attentive. We ordered pita chips and dip first and they were wonderful! Then we moved on to the pork belly tacos and the Ramen bowl.  Both were superb, although the tacos were my favorite! We added sushi and a pita sandwich and shared everything between the four of us.  This place can get pricy,  especially with eclectic tastes and drinks.  However, it has a huge variety of food and can easily accomidate those who enjoy sharing small plates, as well as those who want their own entree. If you park at the nearby shopping center, it's an easy walk to the restaurant. Great food!",

It's always a rough time trying to get a table so I'm always prepared for a lengthy wait. My party of 3 was quoted a wait time of 45 mins to an hour, however after over an hour of waiting we started to notice party after party walking in and getting seated right away, including a party of 6. We spoke with the hostess who informed us she can't seat a party of 3 in a 6 person booth. Even if we've been waiting so long? They'll keep it empty until the required number of people show up? Doesn't make sense.   Once we got seated I spoke with a manager and let me tell you I have never had worse customer service coming from a MANAGER. He completely dismissed my concerns by simply saying there were things I didn't understand. He made it perfectly clear that my experience was none of his concern and I was not valued as a customer.  It is clear Soul Gastrolounge only cares about one thing, and that is the money, and not customer service. Needless to say, an hour and a half wait and $200+ tab is not worth it to be treated so unwelcoming.  I might add that, despite running food to our table several times, this manager never once checked in to see how the rest of our experience was.",

At 5:15 on the app, there was already a 30 minute wait. The app doesn't guarantee you a table at the time they ask you to check in but definitely worth it to get your name on the list. Our server was very helpful and welcoming as soon as we sat down and gave us great drink recommendations. I got their cocktail that was most like a margarita with a sweet corn twist which was interesting. Not my favorite drink. Wished I had gotten the cranberry Moscow mule which my friend ordered. Had a taste of it and it was delicious. I'm a vegetarian so we ordered the fried goat cheese bruschetta and I ordered their vegan sushi. The fried goat cheese was okay but could have used some honey or some crushed red pepper to give it a little bolder flavor. Just tasted like a ball of goat cheese with a crunch. I definitely don't recommend the vegan sushi. Just tastes like a lot of raw vegetables. The chili sauce on the side was the most redeeming part of that dish. My friend ordered the pork belly tacos and said they were amazing immediately after taking her first bite! I looked around the room and it seemed like that was the crowd favorite as everyone ordered it. We ended with their chocolate cake/caramel ice cream dessert. By far my favorite part of the meal! Super rich and flavorful and hit the spot. I really enjoyed the atmosphere in the restaurant, I just don't think I ordered the right vegetarian dishes as there is a lot to choose from. Hopefully I can come back and adjust my review with some different dishes.",

Some of my favorite include the pork belly tacos, the lamb lollipops, any of their sushi and their chocolate bread pudding! The bone marrow is also melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and they'll let you take the bone home as a dog treat as well! The Rocky Mountain oysters are something that only sounds intimidating, but in reality, they are perfectly breaded and fried, very similar in taste and texture to a fried oyster. Even writing a review about their food makes me want to make my next reservation now!   There is always a wait for this place, but trust me, it is completely worth it. It also brings out something else I love, the fact that even though there is a wait, the servers never rush you, and you really get to enjoy your time and savor all the food!",

For my sisters 21st we came here for her first legal drink and the bartender was kind enough to give her a free drink on the house.  My favorite thing to get here is the goat cheese flat bread. It is a-maz-ing! The staff is great and friendly. It has a warm atmosphere. My only complaint is that it can sometimes be a little claustrophobic inside and noisy. That's to be expected in Charlotte though, so overall it is phenomenal.  Cannot wait for our next family birthday or holiday so that we can come here again.",

    "text": "Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Great for a date night or intimate get together. All tapas come with 3 items but can be adjusted for even-numbered gatherings. For reference, between two, splitting 4 tapas was just the right amount to eat. Cocktails are tasty & worth trying, but I've had the best luck just splitting bottles of wine.   Personal recommendations: -Pork belly tacos (one of the most delicious dishes I've tasted to date!)  -Pan con tomate (a friend who has studied in Spain said the dish beat any he's had)  -Falafel  -Dip Trio (eggplant dip is wonderful- available in its own small plate)  - Salmon-o-Pita  -Lamb -Cheese plate (if you're extra hungry, nothing out of the ordinary here)  -Sashimi sampler or split a sushi roll (Dynamite, Queen City, Red Dragon)   Available on NoWait app only- go close to opening time if possible!",

Our favorites are the pork belly tacos (you must order these), the Mac and cheese, and their sushi. We've also had their wings, Brussels sprouts, short rib, and many other items on their menu. I've never had something here that I didn't love.   They have a Moscow mule on tap, and it's wonderful!  The restaurant is small so it's not ideal for groups. It's also hard to get in here (they don't take reservations) so arrive before 7 if you want to have a shorter wait.",

At 9:00pm we go to the restaurant and are told it's an hour and 30 minute wait and that check in time is just to \"check in.\" So instead of making other dinner plans we waited to wait even longer and then ended up leaving. The food is Phenomenal but this no wait app is deceiving and a waste of time. So instead of spending money there we are now eating dinner somewhere else.  To top it off while we were at our next restaurant at 9:24 we got a text saying our table was ready. We would have waited 14 minutes for our table, but were told 2-3 hours",

Yum! - Ahi Tuna Tacos: A great ways to serve up Ahi Tuna- they're not just for Tuesdays. - Lamb Lollipops: Incredibly rich and succulent. - Ramen Bowl: Mouthwatering slurpable noodles.

Yes the waits are very long, but we used the Waitlist feature on Yelp and it made it really easy to plan ahead and arrive around the time our table would be ready. We were seated right away. I had a cranberry mule and it was ok, it was very light which maybe is how it's supposed to be, but it tasted watery. My husband had the left handed susan, which was a little Manhattan-esque and very good.  For food we had the spicy feta, which was a very generous portion and came with pita chips. It was super flavorful and I wish I could put it on everything. We also had the brussels sprouts, which were fine but not my favorite. They didn't quite take on as much of the bacon and balsamic flavors as I would have liked, so they were a little plain. The pan con tomato was simple, but great. I love this dish and always order it if it's on a menu and this one really stood out. The bread was so, so soft and light but also perfectly crispy, and the tomato was fresh. I loved the whipped manchego and the chorizo on the side, it was perfect with the bread or on its own. My husband got the fried oysters since I'm not an oyster fan, and they were also a large portion and he really enjoyed them. We also had the southern fried wings, which were perfectly fried with a great dipping sauce. The highlight of the meal were the pork belly tacos. I think it's the best pork belly I've ever had-flavorful, crispy, and sauced just right. I wouldn't have thought to put watermelon on top, but it really works. We almost ordered a second round of these but we were pretty stuffed.   Overall we had a nice time at Soul. The food really is a notch above a lot of other places in Charlotte. The service was fine, but not the best or friendliest. No one was unfriendly per se, they just felt a little overwhelmed by the tables and it sometimes took a while to get someone's attention and to get the check at the end. But if you're in the mood for a large menu of good food with a hip ambience, it's worth stopping in.",

I just happened to be there earlier and there was already a line at the door before it opened!  Definitely is a good sign.    It is a pretty small space with dark lighting and definitely a hipster vibe.  I snagged a seat at the bar.  The waiter told me the Pork Belly tacos were the most popular so I had to order that and I also got the Veal Short Ribs.  The pork belly tacos I thought was just ok, I did love the watermelon salsa on top but the pork belly itself was a bit tougher.  The veal short ribs though, sooo tender and had so much flavor.  It definitely made up for the tacos!  I wish I had more room to try things.    The ambiance of the place and the ribs definitely made it a nice appetizer stop for me.  Wish I had room for a drink since their drink menu looked phenomenal and interesting.",

I tried some of the feta with oregano, and it was deeelicious. - For dessert, we got the cupcake of the day (goat cheese with raspberry topping), and it was just ok.

This restaurant is super popular -- with its unique cocktails, modern romantic decor, and tapas style menu this place is sure to hit the spot for dinner. It gets very popular though so I recommend trying to get there before 6 o'clock. They also do not take reservations and will not seat you unless your whole party is there. But back to the food: ordering a bunch of different tapas (and even sushi rolls) is the way to go. I love the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos -- the pork is cooked to such perfection that it literally does melt in your mouth, a very popular tapa among customers. The Lamb Pops are also really good, which are smothered in rosemary, pecorino and pepper. Soul also has good sushi, in which I recommend the Charlotte roll, with tempura shrimp inside. Just order a little bit of everything and enjoy!",

I understand that this place is hip and super popular right now, to the point where you're constantly busy with waits for tables over 2 hours. This does not mean that you don't have to be welcoming to your guests and can expect people to keep coming back for more regardless of how they're greeted when entering your restaurant. I'm not very familiar with Charlotte, but there seem to be many options available for dining and drinking, so I don't think you can afford to have someone working the hostess stand to be that rude to your guests. Wow.",

    "text": "Our second time here, and the food is amazing. We got the pork belly tacos (sweetly gazed & topped with a refreshing &a juicy watermelon) which are absolutely delicious, obviously very popular too because everyone had one. We also got the tuna tacos again because they're light and refreshing, and the crispness of the wonton taco is a perfect addition to it. I got the hamachi jalapeno salad, which was amazing. Again, refreshing. My boyfriend got the chicken gyro, which was filling and tasty. I recommend this place to anyone. Price is a little up there though. Service is great. We ordered a drink and took way too long to arrive but other than that, it was great.",

This was by far the most unique dish of the night - sweet and savory with rich and refreshing all combined in one. By appearance, three little cubes of watermelon sitting on top of three little chunks of pork belly don't look like a lot, but these small tacos sure pack a punch.   The shrimp ceviche in coconut milk was also a fun and different interpretation on ceviche - sweet, creamy, and not at all acidic.  Be sure to arrive early or expect a looong wait.",

We took the advice of others on here and put our names on the wait list online. By the time we made it over to Soul, we only had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. Now, I will agree with others that they squeeze you in there tight (which is typically not my cup of tea). BUT after a few delicious cocktails, my husband and I suddenly didn't care what the couple at the table next to us was chatting about.   The food OH the food! Almost everything we had was superb. We of course ordered the Asian pork belly tacos (which I dream about now, thanks Soul), a sushi roll (I can't remember the name), the fried goat cheese bruschetta, the fried Brussels sprouts (not a fan, I thought they were a little too charred), and stuffed shells with pork BBQ (!!!). Our waiter was fantastic (I can't remember his name, unfortunately) and we liked the fact that the tapas came out one right after the other (instead of feeling overwhelmed by all of them at the same time). We thoroughly enjoyed gorging ourselves and can't wait to go back!",

Our waiter talked up this \"lemon vanilla ice-cream\" so we ordered it but she came back to with a sad face to tell us that they had run out. I'm not gonna lie, my heart was a little bit broken. I still want to try it so I guess I have to go back.  I liked the atmosphere, its kind of hipster/trendy...great place for small plates and delicious drinks.",

    "text": "I decided to try Soul for the first time last night. It was my 23rd birthday so i had 3 friends come with me. We didn't have a wait and got to sit on their nicely heated porch. I definitely think it helped that we were there on a Wednesday even though it was 7:15 because every review I've read is that you have to expect to wait at least an hour.   My one friend and i decided to split three dishes off of the Tapas menu. I love tapas menus because i always want to try at least 3 things and am hard pressed to pick just one thing. We split the Dirty South Nachos, Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos, and Shells & Cheese. The best part about the tapas is that they didn't all come at once. They gradually brought the dishes out so we had a natural progression throughout the meal.   After eating their Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos I made sure to tell everyone that these would be served at every major life event that I have. They will be served at my wedding, the birth of my children, and every birthday in between. I was so skeptical of these because the watermelon on top, but boy have i never been so happy to be proven wrong. If you take one thing away from my review it needs to be: GET THE ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS. Your tastebuds will surely thank you.   Do you like fried chicken? Do you think the best part of fried chicken is the crispy skin? Then the Dirty South Nachos are for you. They are delicious and perfectly seasoned and crispy. The pimento cheese that they are on top of is a nice compliment to the \"chips\". You get about 5 large \"chips\" and that's more than enough.   The Shells & Cheese were great. It was essentially perfect mac and cheese elevated to the next level with their fantastic pork belly again. Between the three things we got we had left overs and it was A LOT of food. I felt like i was going to have to be rolled out of the restaurant.   My other friend who came with us got the Guacamole stack. It looked delicious and so pretty. It is definitely on my list of things to try next time i'm there. My last friend got a sushi roll but i can't remember which one. She said it was great as well.  All in all i am definitely coming back to Soul Gastrolounge any time i can.",

Everything was fresh and delicious. I also tried the ramen, which was a special, and it was good, but not as tasteful as the other dishes that our group ordered.

The food came out on separate plates which is different, usually if there are just two rolls ordered they would put it on one.  But it was faster this way and we were able to dive right in!  We sat at the table by the door and when our tiny table got too full of stuff the waitress neatly opened the drawer on the vintage table and promptly lined up the soy sauce and extra things on the table in the drawer - hilarious! And genius!  The rolls were about $10 a piece...very reasonable.    The lamb lollipops are also a favorite with the spanakopita - if you want to get several small plates to share.

Stranded in midwood one night soon after soul's opening, I met up with some friends who were going there for dinner.  Since my only other choice was to sit alone at common market, I followed them, and I was not sorry.  I had one of their sushi rolls...which roll it was is lost in the mist of time and many killed brain cells.  I do remember that it was a little spicy, a little creamy, a little crunchy, and I DEVOURED it.    I wasn't able to return until almost 4 years later, but I watched the twitter feed and my mouth watered at every special they posted.  Finally I was able to go there for brunch.  We shared the truffle fries which were amazing.  I don't know if they come with a dipping sauce, but we didn't get one, and we didn't need one.  I had the chicken and waffles and I once again devoured every bit.  It was also very reasonably priced for the amount of food.  I got a mimosa but I wish I had gotten a bloody mary because my friend's was delicious and came with all sorts of pickled goodies.    Oh, also, they put a cucumber slice in the water, which is like a double boost of hydration for those of us who may or may not be - ahem - dehydrated from the night before.  Soul, I love you!!!",

    "text": "Wish I could review the food because it smelled so good, but unfortunately we never got to try it. Came in to meet a few friends (5 of us total)- we were the first two there and the hostess wouldn't seat us until the whole party was there. I hate that rule, but I understand that many places have that in place. However, I explained that the others were parked and walking up but she wouldn't seat us and then gave up the only large booth to another group that came in after us. Frustrating but no big deal, I told her we didn't mind waiting. Then a table got up and left, leaving three 2-tops all in a row vacant. Hostess refused to let us sit there and put the tables together, even though we were the ONLY people waiting for a table. We asked a few times and she kept saying it was house rules not to seat those tables like that.  I have been a hostess, I appreciate the reasoning of having some general guidelines in place. However, to be that rigid to the point where it was almost laughable as we sat there in the small entryway staring at 6 open seats, was ridiculous. We left and had a bomb meal down the street at Midwood Smokehouse.",

    "text": "I still suffer from that \"want to hate this place\" thing, because seriously, how many Forever 21 tank-dresses and half-finished brand new trad sleeves can I handle seeing in one night? But I'm making an effort, here, to see past the fringe-fratty crowd that fills this place, because it's trying to be good and carve a niche for itself in a nabe that doesn't take to Fancy Tapas Pants. And who doesn't like good beer and well-paired nibbles.  It's odd to me how extreme the differences in service and quality can be on any given night. Even from the same server, the same night, the next week. And that's rough - I have no idea what to expect when I walk in (and like I said in my last review - the prices here are above average, for moi, anyways, so I have some expectations). Sometimes, it takes 20 minutes just to get a glass of water - others, as soon as you sit, you've got menus, a nibble, agua, todos.   So when you're hungry, and need a beer, please, peering around the way-too-tall booth backs can get annoying, quick. If you've got claustraphobic pals, sit at the bar.   The music improves on off nights - they have DJs that don't care as much about crowd-pleasing as they do about, say, a history lesson in 70s Soul or Surf. Getting an education in Sly while eating Manchego and toasties, while sipping a Xingu or Manhattan, yup, that's about as good as it gets.   So yeah, Soul, I don't know what to do with ya. I want to come hang out, often, but the hassle-factors keep me away. So I guess we'll keep our relationship casual. No, I'll call you.",

We were seated at the outdoor balcony within 5 minutes of walking up and the view of the Charlotte skyline was pretty cool at night. Our server was super chill and gave some great recommendations on items to try since it was our first time. We ate about everything on the menu haha. Never in my life could I have thought to order hummus, Korean bbq wings, pecan seared trout, sushi rolls, flatbreads, or aioli french fries and been so impressed with the quality or the inventiveness of the kitchen. I even pitched in and invented my own plate- a cheese grilled cheese stuffed with marinated baby portobello mushrooms. Everything was spectacular! I highly recommend checking this place out of you're in town and want to break away from a typical sit down restaurant. You won't be disappointed.",

This is my third time coming to this place (I was there on 05/02/2015) and truthfully I never had any complaints because the food is just downright good. Their french fries are a must and also, I ordered a mai thai and it was well done. Not too much alcohol and not too sweet, it was simply just on point. My steak and egg sandwich was oozing with extreme juicyness of delight and my company had the soul grilled cheese sandwich and just eating a tiny little piece I just wanted to snatch it off her plate and eat it all. Anyway, my waiter was simply the best. She was not only helpful and patient... she definitely did her best even when I wasn't happy. The only reason I'm giving this score a 4 is simply because the kitchen was moving extremely slow and I had to wait for my original order of fries for a very long time. One thing I do have to say to anyone that likes to eat big... this might not be the place for you. The portions are small, so if you don't like to eat small this is not the place to go. Highly recommendable and I will be back.",

I can't count how many times we heard the answer \"we're so slammed\" when we asked about items we ordered and were missing, or when we inquired about our servers  We had 3 tables on the patio (in winter) with 12 people, and were asked to give up 2 of our tables because we were congregating around one of the tables while waiting for our plates to come out. We originally had tried to move the tables together, but we were stopped by the staff that said \"we're not doing that\" in a 2nd grade teacher tone. I understand moving tables can be frowned upon but we were in a corner outside and were not told during our 2 hour wait that we would not be seated together. Bottom line, scolding customers is not an acceptable way to communicate. Only reason for 2 stars is because other than one hair in sushi incident at the end of the meal, everyone loved the food. I've had 3 or 4 great meals there before this but now I doubt I will return.",

My \"guys\" bartenders Brian, Johnny, Adam, and Bob keep me well hydrated and fed.  Whether by myself or with friends I like \"small\" dishes, tapas grazing. The menu is vast and varied but after 2 years needs a makeover. The specials by chef Jay and John  are the way to go.

We ordered drinks which took about 25 minutes to come... After this he didn't even take our order... It took another 25 minutes for us to be able to order... and I should mention the outside sitting area was maybe half full, so not like he was terribly busy... When the food came it was just ok...

    "text": "Loved it. Cool place. This place is hoppin!! I hate to admit it, but its definitely for the younger crowd, but my old ass will be going back!! They don't take reservations, but they suggest you use the \"NoWait\" app to keep a place in line until your table is ready. Pretty cool. We had a drink at the bar while we waited and the got our table soon after. Drinks were good but pricey. Our waiter was awesome and knowledgeable and gave us great suggestions. I've been dying for Pork Belly Tacos and they were delicious, but I kinda feel like the taco part goes to waste, because all I ate was the pork belly and watermelon. Tender, juicy little nice size bites of sweet, unctuous pork with a piece of cool, sweet watermelon. Yum fuckin O!! We also had the Cheese platter with apricot preserves and toast points. Nice portions of Blue, Goat, Manchego, and Boucheron.  So good. Had to ask for more toast points, we ran out. We also ordered a sushi called the Dragon Roll. It was some kind of fish, tempura shrimp, cream cheese. and the fish was fresh, flavor was on point, so FN good!!!. My dessert was the Chocolate Brioche with Vanilla Ice cream swimming in what tasted like the best chocolate milk you ever had. I couldnt finish it, but I will next time. Go early or use the app. I can't wait to try all the other stuff. I'm getting hungry again!! Fill your belly and warm your soul here. The wait will be worth it!",

Why yes..  We meet there and she is out in the street telling me they are out of vodka.  Sunday brunch, out of vodka, what a travesty.   So we head to Soul, I have heard great things about Soul, but I wondered if the hipsters would kick us out of their club or would the servers be hipper than thou, boy, did I have them pegged all wrong.  Everyone was really nice, food was spectacular and they have great hand made cocktails.  We had bloody marys, my friend ordered chicken and waffles and I ordered an egg and bacon biscuit.  The hit of the day was the cast iron skillet of pimento cheese mac & cheese and of course,  the DJ,Scott Weaver playing great music.",

The service was friendly, the food was very good (for the most part) and the price was right in my opinion.  It was packed for a Thursday night..they had a 45 minute wait but we were seated at the bar immediately.  Our server was super friendly and he was very attentive the whole evening.   We tried the white bean/goat cheese dip---pretty good, small portion and couldn't really taste the goat cheese but it was decent.  The pita chips were a little stale.  Next we tried the curried lamb skewers with mango chutney....this was the show stopper....SOOOOO good!  The lamb was cooked perfectly and the flavoring was not too spicy/hot...it was just perfect...SOO on point!  I HIGHLY recommend trying it!!  We also tried a tuna roll...I can't remember the name but it had cream cheese, it was flash fried, had jalapeno and something else....it was excellent.  Fresh, tasty, just enough crunch, etc.    Lastly, we tried their newest cupcake addition....it was a dark chocolate cupcake with carmel on the top with whipped cream.  This was the biggest disappointment of the night.  The cupcake was dry as could be with ZERO flavor.  If you closed your eyes to take a bite you wouldn't know what flavor you were sampling.  It might be the worst cupcake I have ever tried.  I noticed they pistachio ice cream on the menu and I should have gone with my first instinct and ordered that instead.  Steer clear of their cupcakes...they are not worth the $4.   Overall...like everyone has repeatedly stated...great atmosphere, fun people-watching, good food and just an overall solid spot.  I'll be back.",

Even the 1 that wasn't stellar was pretty good. The servers are all wonderful. Very accommodating, happy to chit chat if you like, or be all business. I will say, if you don't like tattoos and piercings on your waitstaff, probably not the place for you. Me? I don't care. The house mixologist is excellent. His take on a moscow mule is the best I've ever had. Its so good that they keep it on draft! Its one of three restaurants in Charlotte to which I consistently return.   Side note: the sushi is amazing.  Finally, be forewarned: If you go on the weekend you WILL wait two hours to be seated. Its worth it.",

I now understand why most reviews state there is typically a wait. Myself and two other members of my party arrived around 6:10pm. At this time, there was no wait. We did have to wait for the majority of our party to arrive prior to us  being seated. We were placed in a booth, that was suppose to accommodate 8 people. It's a great that  only 7 of us were present- we were packed in the booth like sardines. Regarding the food- it was everything the reviews mentioned. I had the guacamole stack- try it if you are a fan of avocado, the flatbread- my favorite, and the truffle fries, my second favorite. I also tried the Korean wings- too spicy for my taste, fried meatballs- just ok, nothing special, lemon chicken skewer-they were ok, I would not order them again, and a host of other items. The last thing I tried was the pistachio ice cream. It was no bueno!!! It was completely tasteless. The server was nice enough to remove it from my tab. I am a foodie, and have to give credit when credit is due. The presentation of the food is good but more importantly the taste  is what works for Soul. I would record this for a smaller group due to the size being so small!",

We chose the sushi special, which was called Wasabi. But, it really wasn't spicy on its own.  We also got fried oysters.  Primo!  A flatbread featuring truffle whipped giant cheese, honey, arugula and pistachio goat cheese.  Amazing!  And spanakopita in the shape of those little paper \"footballs\" that some of us used to make out of paper and thump with our fingers when we were kids.  You could really taste that fresh dill.

I love music in the background while eating out but it was a challenge ending a sentence with Huh.lol. our waiter african American with locs was pleasant and patient when it came to explaining the menu.   Being a foodie from NY I tasted all kinds of food and open to trying various foods. We wanted to keep it simple and ordered the teriyaki wings which were not the greatest.

We don't ever concern ourselves with the wait, we chill at the bar with the amazing creations that the highly knowledgeable bartenders have to offer. It's not a place to go to just eat--it's an experience from the moment you walk in to the last bite.",

The pork belly and watermelon tacos are by far one of the best dishes in this area. Be warned though this place is NOT cheap. With drinks and a a few different plates your going to be paging but it is worth it.   The brunch on Sunday mornings is to die for as well. The whole menu in the morning you can't miss on. The service is always good though you may have to wait for a table if it's peak hours. Atmosphere is also very nice and low key. Great date place!",

That said, the hubs and I Adore food and I made our way through a good bit of the  menu.  Quick notes:  - The pork belly and watermelon tacos. Are. BALLER.  Seriously, I could eat about a dozen of 'em.   - Ramen - oddly creamy, bland, largely unmemorable but the cheeks were cooked well.  Wouldn't get again. - Marrow - bones were good, parsley salad was Awesome; definitely replicating the latter at home. - Meatballs - kind of dry, but good flavor.  - Flatbread - arugula, truffle-whipped goat cheese, pesto, garlic.  Greasy but very flavorful.  - Crunch Roll  - didn't realize the whole roll was fried, accordingly the fish was cooked through.  Sad face, don't recommend.  - Wings.  Both Korean BBQ and Southern - nothing fancy, but good. - Fries - garlic-herb salt, truffle oil, pecorino, yes!  Giant portion, too.  Service was excellent - Jamie rocked - and though the majority of the food was maybe three-star caliber, the atmosphere, tacos, and friendliness bumped it up to a solid four.",

And every item is an urgent wake up alarm brimming with flavor and attention to detail.  I think I am addicted.

Upon walking in, I noticed it was jam packed and that reservations may have been needed. We went ahead and put our name in and the hostess said it would only be about twenty minutes. Nice, thats a drink at the bar first!  The bar had a spacious standing area that I was happy about. (I hate lurking over peoples shoulders so that our feet are in the \"bar area\"). About a drink in and another on the way, we began talking to the group beside us and found out a few went to the same college as my friend which spurred more chat. It must have been twenty minutes later...(although I was now 3 drinks complete hhmm), when the hostess signaled us to a large table nearby. Our new friends were still waiting so we invited them as well.   The place had such a great energy that everyone was feeling the buzz. We ordered more drinks which was when I was introduced to the Firefly Peach cocktail. Things were fuzzy after that drink made it's appearance, but damn it was good!  In the haze, I do recall having a few tapas passed around and thinking they were tasty morsels of goodness...I just can't recall what in the world they were....",

We were seated at the table, Collette did a great job ... she gets 4 stars.  Tuna skewer , 1 skewer was well cooked on all sides, rare in the middle, 1 was barely seared on 1 side, and completely raw. The tuna was seriously not fresh.  Beef skewer, not bad, but had to ask for s&p as there was absolutely no seasoning on the meat, the chimichurri was oily and bland.  Korean chicken wings, good flavor and well cooked, but didn't strike me as even slightly \"Korean\"  Soul is very popular but I think but I think the kitchen needs serious help.

But having said that, it's worth it. My favorite place to wait is downstairs at Twenty Two, the art gallery. Grab a drink there and look out for them to text you when your table is ready. If it's a nice night, the patio at Soul is perfect. You can watch people walking on the street below and look out at the Charlotte skyline. Most importantly: the food is great. I always always always get the fries. Even if my main course is sushi, I always get fries. They're too good. The sushi is also really good by the way. Mini burgers are great. People rant and rave about the pork belly tacos but they're not my style (too sweet for me -- but still delicious). They have entree, sushi, and drink specials that don't disappoint and change frequently. There are many things on the menu I have yet to try, but I've loved it all so far.",

I recently met a friend here to partake in their dinner menu.  I must say that first off, I was very unimpressed by their beer selection. They only had your standard Domestics on tap/bottle (Budweiser, Michelob and Miller).  I don't understand how this is possible given that Twenty-Two is right below them with a laundry list of great beers.  However, their wine selection looked admirable but alas, I'm not a wine drinker so that's were a star is lost for me.    The Food:  Overpriced but delicious.  My order of Hummus was more filling than my entree of the Pork Belly tacos.  I will say that the Pork Belly was amazing especially when paired with Watermelon, which I wasn't expecting at all.  My friend ordered the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them much the same.   The Environment:  Trendy with various ambient, trip-hop music.   I think that this would be a great meet up place after dinner with non beer drinkers.  There are definitely more affordable places to congregate with a better alcohol content.  Just don't come here hungry and on a budget because you'll just end up somewhere else an hour later.",

They don't give much of a pour if you order a glass of wine, go with a bottle, beer, or mixed drinks.  Usually a loud DJ with house music, but it works.  Whatever you do, don't order the chorizo.  I guess the disclaimer is that, by the time I sit down, it is usually two hours after I intended to eat, so I am starving, and I am three drinks to the wind at the bar waiting, so probably anything would taste good - particularly the fried/fatty offerings.  Perhaps that is their strategy.  Luckily, the ambiance is good so I can stand the wait.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to trying this place with a friend and we were severely disappointed by the food.    Let me counter that by saying that the staff was great, friendly and honest.  I would hang out here for drinks in the evening to hear the music inside or stand outside and look at the skyline.    The Food:   We started with the white bean and goat cheese dip with pita chips.  It was ok.  Nothing special, not too much flavor - but it was white beans.    Next, the chorizo.  WARNING - this was the most disgusting thing I've ever been served.  I couldn't tell if it was raw or just packed full of fat.  It was falling apart in the casing and was so chewy we never actually got to the point of swallowing.    The sardine fries were interesting.  They were mini sardines (full body - head to tail) deep fried with dipping sauce.   Lastly, the lamb lollipops.  These were also no good.  They were so fatty and a little overcooked.    I think the menu was good in theory with a horrible execution.  It seemed like they were trying to be too fancy and didn't quite cut it.  When I looked around, I realized no one else was eating.  Everyone there was just there to drink.  That should have told me something.    Overall:  If you just want a cool place to drink and possibly order some dip and pita chips, then you'd like this place.  Everyone seems pretty cool and laid back.  If you are sick of Thomas Street or you've grown out of Snug Harbor, this could be your new hang out.    If you're looking for a nice meal, look somewhere else.  My suggestion would be Crepe Cellar in NoDa - they've got an amazing menu and daily specials.",

The tapas-style menu features Spanish dishes like chorizo, Greek pitas and dips, some of the best sushi in town, and tons of other fantastic dishes, all served as super-shareable small plates. Come hungry and ready to share. Soul has opened my eyes to dishes I never would have thought I would like - the anchovy fries are now one of my cravings, and I'm not sure where else you can order bone marrow in Charlotte. My favorites are the mini burgers, stuffed piquillo peppers on bruscetta, sticky veal shortribs and replay roll, although not listing the entire menu here is difficult. The bartenders here are also pretty skilled. Great spot choose if trying to impress your foodie friends.",

Their fusion of Greek, Spanish, Asian and American cuisine is always a reason I keep coming back. I find myself ordering half of the menu just to try everything I possibly can! The stuffed piquillo peppers and goat cheese is one of my favorites as well as the Hummus.   The ambiance is perfect for a late night date, or a chill gathering to enjoy smooth house music and good company. With a choice between tables, outdoor seating or couches, this place provides the setting for a very good night.",

Best size group for your money/eating is 4-5 people. Get about 10-11 small plates/sides and split them all. Such a fun way to eat. Portions are small but you'll get to try a ton of things! Top three must-have's are the ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS (only comes with 3 though, so get 2 orders because you will want MORE), the garlic herb fries, and the curried lamb skewers with mango chutney.

    "text": "I am originally from Charlotte, and was back in town visiting family and friends and a friend of mine suggested meeting here for tapas and drinks this evening.  I could not wait to write this review.  I have not encountered such poor customer service in a very long time, and that's saying something, as I currently live in New York City.  The hostess who \"greeted\" me was incredibly rude.  I use the word \"greeted\" very freely.  Basically, she looked me up and down expectantly as I walked in the door.  When I said nothing, obviously expecting a \"Hello\" or a \"Welcome\", she proceeded to sigh and grunt out a \"How many?\"  When I explained to her that I was meeting someone and pulled out my phone to text my friend to ask her if she wanted to sit inside or out, I was told, very rudely and abruptly, that the restaurant was \"obviously very small\" and that she would not seat me  until my party was complete.  Fine.  I understand that many restaurants have this policy.  I was making no complaint.  There's no need for such an attitude.  A bit taken aback by her demeanor, I asked if I could wait at the bar, towards which I was waved with a scowl.  When my friend finally arrived, I tried to settle up with the bartender (for a single seltzer), and he said it was no problem and not to worry about it.  When we approached the hostess to claim a table, she looked at me very accusingly and said, \"Well did you settle your bar tab?\"    I've worked retail, I've worked food service - I know people have bad days, I know these jobs can really suck sometimes, but there is no excuse for attitude like that.  Especially when I did nothing to provoke it.  The waitress was competent, but not particularly friendly or helpful in the slightest.  Food was fine, nothing incredible.  And the red velvet cupcake was dry and infinitely forgettable.  I think the management and staff here should seriously rethink their approach to customer service.  Treat your customers well - they're the one and only reason that you're in business.  I will never, EVER come back here.  And I will never recommend this establishment to anyone.",

Watched people come and go. An hour later and we still hadn't been seated. When I inquired about how much longer it would be, turns out the hostess wrote down the wrong number. We were seated immediately after that, but it took a while for waiter to bring drinks and take order. As far as food selection, menu is unique in offerings. I went with the pita chips and tzatziki dip, fried goat cheese on bruschetta, and mini burgers. Server did not check in with us often and forgot my burger order. I finally got it and manager apologized, but due to lack of attention I passed on ordering the sushi as we had already been there a long time. We also got free drinks because of the inconvenience. Even with the poor service, the food was absolutely delicious and I would be willing to give it another try.",

In fact, I go to Soul just for their Napoleon roll.    If you are looking for a casual place to hang out and have a good time I suggest trying Soul.  I feel that it is a place you will either love or hate.  I personally enjoy it.  The service that we had was great one time and then poor the second time.

Bellied up to the bar. Sat for about 5 minutes or more before a bartender even recognized we were there. Grabbed a bottle and the dip trio plate. PERFECT. Bartender brought us a sample of one of their specialty drinks as well as a sample of some Soju. Def made up for the small blunter. Finally after the kitchen closed we were able to grab a seat outside. Ended up being a great night. Only regret is that I did not get the Shrimp Ceviche and Spicy Feta.... next time.",

Ok, now the more interesting details.  First off, the joint is small...really small and the layout is much like a galley kitchen, you know straight and fairly narrow.  So one side of the place = bar, the other = dinner seating.  Easy peasy.   There was a DJ there when I went so I'm assuming that is the norm.  Strange collection of music the night I was there but it was so loud didn't really matter.  And crowded it was, a little over an hour wait even at 7:45pm.  Keep that in mind and get there early to obtain solid bar real estate while you wait.  The decor is trendy chic and seriously had me pondering for over 30-45 minutes trying to figure out...\"Am I at a bar or a restaurant?\" Hahaha....didn't matter really the spot was fun, full of energy and the food was more than worth the wait :)  My only suggestion would be go during the week when it's not packed, I think I would have enjoyed it even more.",

And because they don't take reservations, we waited to put our name in... While waiting, We overheard the hostess tell the party of 3 in front of us, that it would be about a 5 minute wait.  She went to prepare their table, and came back- we put our name in, and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait... As we watched the party of 3, who came in minutes before us, get sat... We watched 3 other tables, all of which, who arrived at least 30 minutes after us, get sat immediately, at tables that had been empty, the entire time we were waiting. I simply went inside and asked the hostess, why those people were sat immediately/before us, as we saw all of them arrive from the down the street, and she came up with some rude lie... I then explained that I overheard her tell the party of 3 before us, that it would be a 5 minute wait.. And she rudely told me that she never said that... And that we would wait our turn to sit... \"Like everyone else\" needless to say, we didn't make it that far- we left, and had a wonderful dinner elsewhere, at a restaurant with polite staff- that was 10 times more enjoyable. My advice to Soul? Get some employees who are pleasant who greet and take care of your customers correctly, especially ones who know how to articulate themselves to customers politely.

I think if we actually dined in I might be able to give it a 2-star rating to account for freshness and what not, but quite frankly I'm glad I experienced the dulled tastes of our very disappointing food.  the gist: * pork belly/watermelon tacos: overcooked and dried out pork belly (FAIL), mushy watermelon (YUCK) * nachos: unbelievably excessive grease (even for chicken skin) * lamp lollipops: bland and dry * wings: not memorable, so likely not terrible offensive.",

    "text": "I moved to Charlotte about 6 months ago and have not wasted a second to try all of the fantastic restaurants offered in this unsuspecting town.  After a few wonderful experiences and some mediocre, I finally made it to SOUL.  I had only heard great things about it other than the fact that they dont take reservations & don't seat until the entire party is there.  This was not that big of a deal, when you see how tiny the place is inside.    My first experience was great and I could not wait to go back when my boyfriend was in town.  We didn't want to wait for a table so we sat at the bar.  We had \"Bob the Bartender\" and couldn't have asked for a better server.  We told him we wanted him to basically do a tasting menu but to keep it under $100.  He not only made us FANTASTIC drinks but each dish he served us paired well with each cocktail. I had the cucumber martini that he prepared old school style by pouring the liquor into the glass from above his head.  He served us wonderful tapas including the Dancing Tuna roll, Fried egg Mushroom toast, hamachi jalapeno sashimi, ahi tuna tacos, pork belly w/ watermelon, etc. For dessert he made us the most delicious Chocolate Martini; I had the goat cheese icecream and my bf had the pistachio.  Both delectable.  I cannot say enough great things about this place, the food & service are amazing and it has been a regular stomping ground for me in Charlotte.  Bravo Soul!",

I love that they post their daily specials on facebook and twitter. Also their brunch is awesome.  I recommend the chicken and waffle for brunch. For dinner i always get the soul roll and the wings or the cheeseplate as an appetizer. All the drinks are unique and won't disappoint you.",

    "text": "Soul is by far my in my top three restaurants from Charlotte to Los Angeles.  Never have I had a bad experience.  The food is inventive, delicious and decadent.  The atmosphere is intimate and has a very cool vibe.  Be prepared to watch your neighbors expressions as their food is brought out - you will start having discussions about the intricate flavors and presentation and find yourself sharing with complete strangers.  I absolutely cannot go here without ordering at least two of the Pork Belly Watermelon Tacos.  Those alone are worth the trip.  This evening, we tried one of the specials - tempura asparagus with garlic aioli...yes, please!  We did ask for some extra aioli on the side and continued to sample it throughout the entire meal.  Next up was the Soul Roll - spicy salmon, cukes, jalapeno, sliced white tuna, wasabi aioli, spicy mayo sauce  - just enough kick to finish off the delicate white tuna.    We followed the roll with the Pan Con Tomate  - Spanish chorizo, whipped manchego, rioja reduction - the fresh garlic and whipped manchego literally made me want to scrap the plate clean.  And don't miss out on the Flatbread with truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto, honey braised garlic and fresh arugula - one of my favorites to start the meal.  Just enough sweet with fresh arugla and how can you go wrong with goat cheese?!  If you care to partake in a drink - try the pink sake - tastes like a light, crisp sweet champagne.  The cucumber martini is perfect for Summer.  If you haven't tried Soul, run don't walk - you have no idea what you have been missing!",

This is a place that makes everyone look cooler than they are though, the lights were super low and there was a DJ. The fries were salty and the drinks were amazing but way too expensive. I also tried the korean bbq wings which were spicy and decent. I'm not dying to get back there though. If i'm invited to join a group of friends, and I have nothing to do, I might join em.",

The tables are very small and very close together so just prepare yourself for that.  I wasn't able to eat the sushi but my husband did and he said it was excellent, can't wait until I am able to give it a try myself!  We also had the pesto arugula flatbread and that was probably my favorite item. The goat cheese with the honey garlic was perfect. We also sampled the shrimp skewers which were good but nothing super amazing. We had the southern fried oysters which I quite enjoyed and the dipping sauce was very delicious, spicy but not overwhelming. We had the serrano and manchego cheese on toast which was delicious. Overall everything we had was good and we will def go back. I will def. be trying their sushi personally as I hear it is the best in the city!",

    "text": "Maybe I don't get out as much as I used to since we had kids, maybe it was the prospect of a well-deserved and overdue date night with the wife, but this was one of the top 10 meals of my life.  Pork belly tacos, ahi tuna skewers, beef chimichurri skewers, korean BBQ wings were all amazing. My wife loved the tuna sashimi tacos as well. Showed up around 7:00 PM on Saturday night and had to wait a reasonable 30 minutes because we wanted to sit inside and it was well worth it. The ambiance inside is great for date night, can easily hear your companion but its not definitely buzzing in there so you don't feel bad laughing and having a good time.  Would highly recommend this place. I think 4 people would probably be the max i would bring considering there aren't that many tables unless you're willing to wait a while, the place doesn't take reservations. Owner told us this place gets really busy around 8:30 PM on Saturday, so would try and get there early in the night if you can. He also told us you can call and put your name down on the list when you're on the way..  My wife and I LOVED this place and hope to be back soon!",

    "text": "We knew we wanted to take our friends from out of town somewhere delicious and unique, and I had this spot recommended to me time and time again. So we decided to try it out.  We were not disappointed.  We chose to sit inside, which was definitely the best choice. The atmosphere, the couches, and the lighting make the inside the better choice. Soul has a great lounge-feel with interesting music and amazing food & drinks to compliment.  I had a glass of champagne, while others tried local beers. The champagne complimented the food well.  For four of us, we ordered six tapas and all felt full afterwards (two men & two women in our group). I think when you're all snacking for an extended period of time, you tend to fill up and not feel like you need a full meal.  We ordered:  Porkbelly Watermelon Salsa Tacos: This was as incredible as everyone on Yelp says it is. It didn't look like much when we got it, but every bite was incredible. Two tacos come with this.  French Fries with Truffle Oil: Could. Not. Stop. Eating.  Dip Trio: Pretty good. I will probably forgo next time.  Lamb Gyros on a Skewer: Yes, yes, yes.  Soul Roll: Not nearly as spicy as I expected, but I can't really eat spicy foods so I thought it was perfect.  Queen Charlotte: Seemed like one of the less adventurous rolls, but it was one of the best sushi rolls I've EVER had.  I would bring anyone back to Soul and can't wait to go back myself. I love this place!",

Ordered the dip trio, the jalepeno sushi roll, the pork belly taco's and the salmon in filo. All top-notch, especially the pork belly taco's (very addictive and the watermelon on top is perfect).  Only gripe is that most of the beer specials were by the bottle versus on-tap. As usual atmosphere was cool - funky, dark and loud.   Great option for a dinner with friends.",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite restaurant, EVER. My fiancee and I will never leave Charlotte without having dinner and drinks here. We have gone on many different nights of the week. Although weeknights typically less crowded, there is usually always a bit of a wait (which is always worth it).   One of my favorite aspects of this place is their drink menu. I've lived in the tri-state area my whole life, so I have been spoiled by many speakeasy cocktail bars in New York City. My fiancee and I tried to find something comparable in Charlotte. It wasn't until we found Soul Gastrolounge that we found a place that offered invigorating cocktails that went beyond margaritas and manhattans. Their drink menu is always changing and they are tailored to the season.   Their menu is incredibly versatile. Following a tapas style menu, small plates range from salads, skewers, wings, tacos, and flatbreads to sushi, sashimi, sliders and paninis. You would think that with such variety, that it all couldn't be good. However, I have NEVER had something that I didn't like. A few unique specials are always offered, but the regular menu alone can keep you occupied. My favorites are the midwood mixed greens salad, chimichurri beef skewers, pork belly tacos, goat cheese and pesto flatbread, the Soul Roll, and Korean BBQ wings. We have been there several times and still haven't tried everything that we've wanted to. Don't forget to try their cupcake of day for dessert.   A DJ has always been spinning when we've gone. Following with the lounge theme, he plays subtle, but not typical or cheesy lounge music. It's enough to spark your interest without being overwhelming or distracting.   I HIGHLY recommend Soul Gastrolounge!",

    "text": "Wow. This is, hands down, one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. After being told about it constantly, I finally made my way there. Since my first visit three weeks ago, I have been back 3 times (thats how good the Pork Belly Tacos are). Along with the pork belly tacos, the other 8 plates at my table including the ahi tuna tacos, steak skewers, the crunchy roll, lamp lollipops, and all the other items were all absolutely delicious - nothing disappointed.   While I clearly love the food, the service is attentive and the ambiance is really eclectic and comfortable also making for a great experience. However, Soul only got $ stars from me because for even such an amazing restaurant, the three hour wait was a little overkill. I got forced into waiting, because yes I like it that much, but since you can sit and eat, talk, and drink for so long, people end up hanging around forever. For not having that many tables and being permitted to sit for 4 hours, if you so choose, the place gets a bit cluttered and you end up waiting a long time.   I guess when people agree to wait for three hours to eat there, they dont really care but the amount of extra business they could be doing is unfortunate.   But if I leave you with anything...its get the pork belly tacos!!",

    "text": "My husband and I have been wanting to try Soul since they opened, and decided our 1 year anniversary this past weekend was the perfect occasion. We arrived at 8:00pm on a Monday and were surprised to find out there was a 30 minute wait. Around 30 min later we were sat at the bar and the food was more than worth the wait.  We started out with four dishes; Baba Ghanoush dip, anchovy bruschetta, lamb cheek profiteroles, and curried lamb skewers. The Baba ghanoush with pita chips was smoky and spicy, probably the best I've ever had. The marinated Spanish white anchovies on Bruschetta were refreshing, lite, and full of flavor, everything on the bruschetta was super fresh. The profiteroles for me were by FAR the highlight of the meal and one of the top 5 dishes I've ever eaten in my life. The kitchen was on point because everything on this plate was perfection. It was the first time I've had savory profiteroles which I thought was very creative, they were stuffed with tender lamb cheek, mushroom jam, and a foie gras  mousse. The three ingredients just kind of melted together and although the portion was small, they were so rich that it really ended up being the perfect amount. I would normally have a heart attack after paying $18 for 3 golf ball sized \"sandwiches\" but these were so good that we will probably order them every time we go back! The last dish of our first go around was the curried lamb skewers with mango chutney. The lamb was cooked and seasoned well, but there wasn't anything necessarily special about the lamb itself. But, the mango chutney was perfection, and we probably could've eaten a few bowls of that on its own. The pairing of the curry with the sweetness of the mango worked perfectly and definitely elevated the flavor of the lamb.  Our second go around we ordered the Rocky Mountain Oysters, Sakana Roll, and Korean BBQ wings. The choice of the Rocky Mountain Oysters was really just out of curiosity. I always see Food Network hosts eating them when they're in Colorado and I was curious to taste them. They were perfectly cooked and incredibly tender, but I just did not care for the taste. They were good and my husband ended up eating the whole plate, but there is nothing in this world I hate more than liver, and although very mild, they did have a slight liver taste. The Sakana roll was pretty good and I really liked the combination of sauces that they served it with. Finally we had the Korean BBQ wings which were cooked perfectly. They were tender, very moist, and very flavorful.  The only disappointment of the night was dessert. I was eyeing the goat cheese ice cream since I first opened up the menu and when we ordered it the waitress told us they no longer make that flavor and we must have received an old menu. That was kind of a buzzkill, but we moved on and ordered the Vietnamese coffee ice cream. This is definitely not a cheap restaurant, but up until dessert, everything we ordered was more than worth the price. The ice cream scoop was $4 and it was about a 3oz scoop barely larger than a golf ball. I guess we're kind of picky because we make ice cream at home a lot, but our 1st shot at Vietnamese coffee ice cream was better than that. It was not a huge deal, just kind of anticlimactic after such delicious savory dishes.  My husband also ordered an Old Fashioned and said it was delicious. Lastly, the DJ was fantastic and one of the highlights of the night. We were seated right in front of him which was entertaining, and he was playing old school records all night which was the perfect type of music to accompany our food!  All in all it was one of the best meals we've ever had and cannot wait to go back. My husband thinks we can try the whole menu in 3 more visits, which I think is a bit ambitious, but I'm sure we will get there eventually!",

    "text": "This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in the city. From the towns favorite pork belly tacos to the fresh sushi. Complimented with a refreshing glass of cucumber water. It's heaven!!! My first time ever having a food-gasm was here!! I wouldn't recommend coming here if your super hungry because from experience you can rack up a pretty hefty bill. Great food, amazing service, and awesome atmosphere. Grab your friends and check out the epic always changing and very diverse menu they have to offer. I give my stamp of approval.   Now, on the other hand the wait is ridiculous because of the popularity. They don't rush you to leave but you kinda feel bad because you know how it feels to keep waiting. Well worth the wait though.   Menu favs:  Pork belly tacos Tuna tacos Spider Roll Shrimp skewers  Lamb lollipops Grilled cheese Wings (all flavors) And many more",

I don't think I will order them again, but they were certainly an experience.  Oh, and we sat at the bar right in front of the DJ, so much fun!",

    "text": "This place is a solid 4. I love places that serve tapas generally because the food isn't boring and that's exactly why I love this place!   There is a great variety of things on the menu. These tapas are pretty pricey, but if you want to treat yourself once in a while, then go for it. Everyone usually suggests the pork belly tacos. Pork belly is getting more and more common these days, but they use a watermelon salsa and surprisingly...it's awesome. I also recommend the sashimi tuna tacos and the veal short ribs. They were all pretty worth it.   **I think the lamb lollipops are NOT worth it. It's one of the more pricier options on the menu and there's nothing that special about them. The lamb lollipops at Davidson St. Public House are better in my opinion.  Besides the food, I love the environment of this place. Great place to meet up and grab drinks after work or late at night. There's usually always a wait though so that's a downside.  note: Kitchen isn't opened til closing time.",

    "text": "Took my parents to Soul yesterday (Sunday) for mom's birthday brunch.  We just got done with the never-ending halls at the Christmas show.  I was defying all traffic laws and regulations just to make it here before 3 (brunch is from 11-3).   As I was dashing into the door at 7mins before 3, they sat us at one of the loungy couch area immediately.  The waiter knew we were to order brunch and took our orders promptly and calmly.  He was very attentive and helpful through our meal.  Definitely thumbs up on the service (I forgot to catch his name)  We shared 3 dishes: shrimp and grits, chicken and waffle, and southern biscuit with gravy and sausage (added an egg for $1).  Here is my verdict on the food:  Best dish is chicken and waffle.  3 small pieces (2 pieces of wings and 1 thigh meat) fried super crispy yet moist (at least the wings I was eating). The waffle is fluffy. All for $9 which is quite reasonable.   Best side item is sage rope sausage. Very tasty. I can probably eat an entire plate of them. Not too salty, the casing is just crispy enough. Just simple pork greatness.   Worst side item is biscuit.  I guess I am used to flaky buttery bo biscuit. This is a little chewy and doughy.    Least worthy dish is the shrimp and grits.  It wasn't horrible, but for $12 it was disappointing. It looks and smells like awesomeness in a bowl, yet it was more bland than I would ever imagine.   Granted not everything was great (hence not a 5 stars review), I will definitely come back for another brunch. Comparing to nearby places, I find this place more economic and food choices more appealing.",

Only about half the tapas we tried were any good. The meatballs were unremarkable and the shells and cheese were a no-go: the intense sweetness of the BBQ pork belly in it didn't pair well with the heavy cheesiness...just an overwhelming dish, and far too sweet. Portions were also pretty small, given the quality of the food. Service was pretty good, as was my cocktail, but I don't think the food was good enough to warrant coming back.",

Once we ordered everything and we were ready for the check,  she seemed to be disappointed that we didn't order more. With that being said,  once we asked for the check, she seemed a bit awkward in a way that seemed rude. She was in a sense rushing us out of there because she cleared our table extremely fast and even took our water pitcher away. Not sure if it was my fiance and I, but we definitely got a weird vibe from her. Regardless, I will be back for another night out in the near future,",

First off, do not come starving as you will likely encounter a wait of 45 minutes up to 2.5 hours on a busy night (Thurs, Fri, Sat). No reservations unfortunately. It will be worth it though and once your name is on the list you can either get drinks at the bar, or walk down to Thomas Street Tavern or the wine bar just below.   The setting is intimate and I prefer the booth seating as it feels like you have your own private room for the group. The other tables are fine too, the only seating I do not recommend is at the DJ booth. There is a great view of downtown from the outside balcony, which is also very nice to take in during the Sunday brunch.   Food wise everything is unique and very well made. Start off with 3 or 4 orders of various tapas items to share amongst yourselves. I recommend the Mushrooms on Toast, watermelon pork belly tacos, or the Soul roll sushi.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "SOOOOOOO Basically I love this place and enjoy coming for not only the fantastic drinks and eats, but the atmosphere, art/soul & general vibe of the joint... not to mention they serve some of the best eats late night in this entire CITAYYYY! Okay enough about how much I actually love this place bc this is ::dun dun dunnnnnhhhh...:: is a negative post bc i had an absolutely terrible **** of a server. I made him wait (my relatively blind date) and we made our server follow us as we moved down 3 whole tables to the corner table to have a little privacy earlier this evening... we must have asked far too much of her. I KNOOOOOOOOW that everyone has a bad day every once in a while and I say this with the deepest concern bc I too have been a server for many years... almost a decade to be exact (although I don't look it) NONE THEE LESS... I don't know her name... this relatively wretched looking, worn down, mousey brunette server with her muffin-top and complete disregard for her looks in general, not matching, no makeup, hair w obviously no effort and potentially unkempt for quite sometime with the rest of her looks... had less then charm, patience, concern or general care of us (i was on a FIRST date  mind you) as patrons. I am being potentially bias and a touch harsh do to upset but honestly she was quite the sight for sore eyes in the joint and I wouldn't give her a gold star for server of the month, I expected more bc everything is normally perfection. The general purpose of the story IS that she was a mediocre and not so visually or otherwise satisfying server...NOT saying she deserved or should have gotten a 10% tip... but she did. In my defense I was on a FIRST DATE!!! We left not keeping her tooo late, I mean the dance music was still bumping and we went to Thomas Street to have a night cap (we did see her there after her shift I'm presuming) then on the walk back to my car as we cross-walked in front of our server in whatever POS she is still struggling to pay off  and she yells from her window \"THANKS FOR THE 10% TIP\"  then peals off and hauls ass. Before her rude display of disdain from an unsavory tip (honey it happens to the best of us) I hadn't a clue... my date was embarrassed (which he should have been, 10% is never acceptable but NOT that she deserved much more...she wasn't an impeccable server by ANY means) I was without words and it was just a sh!t end to an otherwise decent evening. All I'm saying is loud mouth b!tches that don't know when it is appropriate to say something and when it isn't is the ONLY problem if any bc SOUL is an amazing place and the completely uncouth lady (i say that lightly) that served my table didn't deserve the tip she got. I understand a bad night but we weren't even a rude table and sometimes instead of acting like an a-hole you just gotta chock it up to the game, I say it only from experience... cut the fat from the sassy server staff and I would have NO complaint. BASICALLY I wanted to say B!TCH bc I didn't get to before she sped off. Get a filter... Serving is an acting job and you diffidently didn't look or act the part... step it up or find a new profession bc you suck.",

We decided to eat outside on their heated patio. We started with the cheese plate, and white bean and goat cheese dip, both were very good. We were then bombarded with everything else we ordered, this always irritates me at tapas restaurants because the whole point is to eat slowly, trying and enjoying each new plate. IF your gonna bring it out all at once don't put tapas as your main menu, put app and entree. It was so bad we literally had no room for the last plate on our table. Other than that the tapas was very good. Here are our highlights: the mushroom and egg toast was amazing, curried lamb skewer was also very good, it came with a mango chutney, the fried oysters were also very fresh. I wouldn't recommend the braised veal shank as it was very fatty, the dolmades were just OK, but the hummus that was served as a side was out of this world. I would also avoid the the cupcake, it was very dry. The pistachio ice cream was extremely creamy and had nice pieces of crushed pistachios in it. We will definitely be back to try this place again.",

    "text": "First off let me say that the atmosphere is what we went for. I love the exposed brick, low lighting and relaxed seating. It does get a bit noisy around the bar, so if you are looking for something more private get a booth. We were able to grab one of the couches and people watch while enjoying the food. One down side is they do not take reservations so get there early. Luckily, I knew this and we showed up around 6:30 and were one of the last to be seated right away and ended up staying until around 9. This is a tapas bar so you never really know how long people will stay.  Now...onto the food... Which was amazing! The tuna tacos were great, I would have liked them in a soft taco instead of a hard shell, but that is just personal preference. I found myself with sauce all over my fingers after one bite. The white bean and goat cheese dip was just ok, I tasted more bean than cheese though. We had an amazing flatbread that was on special that evening which was the highlight for me. New potatoes, corn, cheese and pesto... Mmmmm! Something I have learned is ALWAYS ASK FOR THE SPECIALS!   The drink prices were right on target and not overpriced. The service was on point before our server was sat several times with one table being a party of 12. Tatyana still checked on us often and kept our water glasses filled.   Minus one star for not being able to make reservations or call ahead seating. We do not live close to the city, so showing up and not being able to get in when we want would be disappointing.  Overall a great experience. We will be going back!",

The music selection also compliments the decor and Soul's prime upstairs real estate. Some patrons are what we might label as hipsters and C Town is glad to have you Soul.   And now on to the star of the show, fooooooood. The menu is quite eclectic. Tapas is the theme and items range from baba ganoush to sushi to bone marrow. For it not being a True sushi restaurant, the tuna was amazingly fresh and of high quality. So fresh that I can also honestly say that it was better than some real so called sushi restaurants around town. All of the menu items looked so enticing that I really wanted to try them all in one sitting. Next time P, next time.",

It helps that \"Rock with You\" was playing as we walked in...  Yes, the indoor volume could be 40-50 dB lower but I dont talk a whole lot and so this didnt bother me terribly. Our server was very patient and attentive without being officious. The eats were tasty and plate sizes were sufficient, read \"UNAMERICAN.\" The portions are not the most generous but appropriate  for tapas. Cab was quite amazing: a hearty pour in a wine tumbler- I like your style Soul.   Won't be dying to go back, especially on a busy night, but I live nearby so I am inclined to REvisit on the slow and easy.",

Located in the funky neighborhood of Plaza-Midwood, across from Fuel, this place is small, but worth the wait, which I would expect if you get there to eat after 7pm. However, this is an official PBR restaurant and waiting for me is quite enjoyable!   Menu is all small plate and has something for everyone. I'm a fan of the sushi, tuna tacos, small sandwiches and the lounge atmosphere. Come here with an appetite and an open mind to try anything and everything. I find myself coming here often and trying a little of the same and a little something different every time. That's the fun of Soul. (and the PBR of course)",

We began the night with some sushi, which were as good as could be. Then we moved on to 'the good stuff'. I ordered the pork belly tacos, omagherrd. Also got to try the baked cheese plate dealy thingy, it's like three or four cheeses melded together bathed in a Brandy, sooo goood. I have yet to try the Lamb Lollys but hear they're amazing. :) Give this one a try for sure! You won't be disappointed! Top 10 in Charlotte for sure.",

But the tables are so close together that you feel like you are on a group date. For some reason they did not have nearly enough menus and people were asked to share and people were asking tables next to them to borrow theirs so it was weird. Service was good, no complaints there. Food was OK but I thought it was overpriced and not that great. If you want small plates, Good Food on Montford, Dandelion Market and Heist Brewery are all better. This place is very popular with hipsters and yuppies alike, so maybe this is the kind of place where people like to go just to say they did. Or maybe I'm just too old and lame to understand the hype. But either way, we enjoyed our evening but not enough to go back again. There are better options.",

    "text": "I visited Soul Gastrounge twice in the last two weeks and I've gotta say I'm underwhelmed.  The first time I went I was stuffed but friends ordered the veal shortribs, Korean BBQ wings and pork buns.    Short ribs- Not as tender as I would have liked.  The whole point of braising is to get the meat to a point where its fork tender.  This was not the case and it distracted from the overall flavor.    Korean BBQ wings- the outside skin was nice and crunchy but the inside meat was bland and not seasoned.  So anticlimactic.  Pork buns- They were ooook.  The meat to bun ratio could have been kicked up a bit but the flavor was to be expected.  Now, the second time I visited Soul was a hot mess.  I arrived at 7:30 to find that there were no tables available.  I understand that this is commonplace most nights.  I ordered a crunch roll at the bar- I thought this was yellowtail and some tempura flakes or something.  An HOUR later my sushi was done.  Admittedly, it did get pretty crowded in there but come ON.  You dont even have to cook it!  When I asked the bartender where my sushi was his only response was, \"it's coming.\". Well, it came but I don't think it was a crunch roll at all, it was the tempura shrimp roll.  But I ate it anyway, I was starving by that point.   It was also very tasty-which I hate to admit.  So that said, if I go back to Soul Gastrolounge, I will be a) only ordering sushi and b) watching my waiter/waitress/sushi chefs like a hawk so they don't play games with my food.",

    "text": "We went to Soul this past Saturday night for dinner for the first time.  We were impressed by our initial entrance.  The restaurant/bar is situated on the 2nd floor of an old restored brick building.  The outdoor seating offered fantastic views of the Charlotte Uptown skyline.  Inside there are a few booths (with high backs), a few tables, a bar, a DJ booth with stools, and some sofas and chairs.  All in all, it offered a great, casual, fun atmosphere.  The place was \"hopping,\" but luckily, we were seated right away at some empty stools indoors around the DJ booth (who wasn't there at the time).    The menu offers a variety of tapas.  We had a hard time picking out which ones we would order, but finally were able to narrow it down to five to share.  We chose the (1) Sashimi Tuna Tacos, (2) Lamb Lollipops, (3) Bone Marrow, (4) Boursin Cheese Stuffed Piquillo Peppers on Bruschetta, and (5) the Sushi Crunch Roll.   The tuna tacos were very flavorful and were like very mini tacos.  The lamb was good and tender, but I probably wouldn't order them again because I'd rather try some of their other (cheaper) skewers of meat.  We were adventurous with the bone marrow, but it was our least favorite and something we wouldn't order again.  It was a little too gel-like for my taste, although one of them tasted like egg (?).  The bruschetta was creamy and rich with flavor.  I'd definitely order that again.  The sushi crunch roll was huge!  It was very wide, so we had to cut it in half before eating it.  I liked it, but I've had better crunch rolls, so I'd try a different kind of sushi roll next time.    Our server was fantastic.  She was very friendly and, being that it was our first time, she explained a little bit about the menu.  Even though she had several other tables, she kept checking on us after each tapas was brought out.    All in all, we had a fantastic time and it's a great place to hang out for a date night, with friends, or to bring out-of-town guests who like a vibrant scene.",

The lamb lollipops were delicious and the chicken skewers offered up some of the juciest and most flavorful chicken I've had in a while. The dessert menu offered up 3 flavors of cupcakes which were slightly on the dry side. We tried the red velvet and the chocolate, and they were equally as average.  Most importantly, prepare for a lag between the time that you order and the the time you receive your food, even if it's just a little busy. In my opinion, steer clear of a server named Jackie if you want things done right!",

If someone says they don't want the bar, make sure to ask them if the sushi bar is okay before seating them there.

    "text": "This place is a little gem. The food is unique and fun. It's a super eclectic mix of cultures and flavors. It's pretty small and seating is limited, they don't take reservations so there is always a wait!!! Not bad when there's two or four of you but If 6 girls show up for a birthday dinner you might be waiting for-eva!  They are on the no-wait app so that helps a little. I highly recommend you get on that before you arrive to help move you along.   So once/if you get a seat (possibly a 2 hour wait) they have such great small plates!!! Well they only have small plates.  Spanakopita  Tuna tacos  Best grilled Caesar salad I've EVER had Hamachi with jalapeno  Queen Charlotte roll Mushroom on toast Avocado stack  Are a few of my favorites. I don't eat lamb but a friend raved over the lamb lollipops. And another girl enjoyed the watermelon and pork belly taco.   Stay away from the Rocky Mountain oysters. There are no oysters in the mountains so that my friend will be an order of sheep, maybe goat balls! Can you say gross. I don't care how good someone says they are, those things aren't coming close to my mouth!   I love this place. It's a fun loud artsy atmosphere, all the staff is super casual and a little hippy. Lots of tattoos and patchouli.  It's great. Just go on a night that's not a 2 hour wait, or plan for it so you aren't starving as you stand and sip on their delicious cocktails",

The avocado had to much brown on it, that kinda turned my stomach.  The environment was horrible, some drunk girl was making out with her boyfriend blocking the way out in the middle of the stair case.  She became very aggressive making me feel like she was gonna push me down the stairs when I was trying to get past them. They need security working that area, it's a long way down the stairs if you were to get pushed.  At the very least the management should have the aggressive behavior from their drunk customers under control. Things could have escalated very quickly to a major injury leading to a law suit.    Soul Gastro you might wanna address this issue with your management team before something serious happens to someone here.  Not a safe environment. To many angry drunk people  with no one monitoring their behavior.",

We got there really early, before 5:30, and there was already a wait. And you have to stay there while you wait. Once we were seated, the music was so loud that we couldn't talk. We were right by a speaker. I asked about a solution and our great server turned our speaker off till we finished. OMG, the good is so good, it might be worth the wait at times!",

If the table wait is too long, you can grab a bite at the bar and its just as good. I've done that with 3 others in my group before and it worked just fine. They have a daily special food menu, albeit, its limited, in addition to the delicious full menu they always have. They have the popular items like the pork belly tacos and all their yummy sushi (some of the best sushi you can get around Charlotte, I think) as well as specials like grilled octopus with potatoes and smoked paprika potatoes. I just love it there.  The drink menu is one of the best in town and the bartenders will listen to what you like an d make you a refreshing cocktail that way too.  Its a great date night place or a fun place for you and your girlfriends to go. Whatever the reason, just go!",

The salad was very refreshing and the chicken skins were good , but I can only have many one . It's very very filling .  Another item to get is the Asian style hot wings . Different and delicious.   Also had dessert . It was a thin flaky type of pastry filled and had ice cream on the side . Different but I enjoyed it .   Go here !!!",

Everything from the ambiance to the music really set the tone of the mood-posh, yet chill, with slightly romantic undertones.  The menu seemed like it was designed around those exact themes, as there were many classic items on the menu such as, stuffed shells or short ribs with a twist on them. Except these items were smaller, and meant to be shared with company.  I enjoyed the short ribs as well another pork tacos and they were both equally delicious.  As I ate my meal, Two patrons beside me said that they frequented the restaurant and they loved everything on the menu. This was an automatic cue for my return! What a pleasure to dine here.",

    "text": "Where to begin. Okay so if you didn't know they are open 5pm-2am. So for dinner, they do have the no wait app which is moving to yelp! So get on there at 5 and request your table so you don't have to wait! Because otherwise you will! It's a hot spot and for good reason. Also it's on the smaller time so it's easy to see why the wait can get long. If you happen not to do it that way and you find yourself there with a wait, have no fear! You are in the heart of plaza with so many good drink spots all around you. My recommendation? Go walk over to the Workman's Friend, and have a drink while you wait.   For us, we got seated at the bar. There are some cozier, more romantic seating. Good vibes in there. Chill. Drink wise, I may be the only one, but I was not impressed at all. Except for that infused cucumber water, that was on point! So my advice, go simple and order a mule or a beer. Surely those won't disappoint. The food? Amaze.   *Sushi - \"The Supernova\" roll $16  - Best I've ever had, if you like crab you got to try this! *Brussels Sprouts $10 - Yummy, best in my opinion is at the summit room though.  *Sashimi Tuna Tacos $11 - I could have ate two orders by myself but I didn't.  *Pork belly Tacos - With watermelon, interesting. But their pork belly is perfect. *Shrimp ceviche - Very good. Shrimp is smaller, and does have some spice to it. Baby jalapenos in there! *Sancho cocktail $13 - Basically a spicy marg, but literally the hardest drink to drink ever. Comes in a short stem glass, completely filled with packed ice, and chili powder all over of the side of the glass. So...no way to hold it or drink it really. They serve it with a small bamboo straw that doesn't work well at all, so I struggled the whole time to drink it and ended up dumping ice all of my face.  * Floating Roots $14- Just not as good as the ingredients sound. Just pass and stick with simple. Go for gold, go for the mule.   Overall super good food, good vibes. I'll be back fo sho!",

If you come alone like I did they will tell you that the tables are for couples or groups but the bar is first come first serve which you will wait over 20mins to sit down if not longer.   While I am waiting I see the bartenders making craft cocktails like the mixologists  that i love going to bars to see. But the first drink I order came out of a premix tap which was disappointing as it tastes like a margarita over ice. I told the bartender I would like something different and they gladly made me a drink that tasted like a Negroni and Sazerac had a baby and it was lovely. Then later I had a Cucumber Mule off of premix tab and it was really.   Now let's eat... I had the pork belly watermelon tacos and the lobster grilled cheese sandwich which was so yummy that I am going back for that alone. I wanna try other things on the menu like the bone marrow.   I really enjoyed it...the only down side was trying to find a place to park and the people that keep insisting on ordering drinks over me and my food without a single excuse me.",

We got a bunch of different sides (plates of food) & shared them. We got the curry mussels, cheese plate, the trio (Tzatziki Hummus & Babaganoush), elk, coconut sivisha, cheese & shells, brcushettca, & salted caramel phyllos w/ ice cream. It was all delicious!! Even though the place was packed - our waiter was still attentive",

I was told they're known for their occasional drop in mixologist and yummy tapas.   First off the waiter made me a drink after I described what I like. It was pretty good-kind of like a Kentucky mule. My cousin and I ordered a few tapas to share. I had no idea what Rocky Mountain oysters were so I was in for a surprise... she enjoys that one and I'm apprehensive. We also got tuna sushi and pork belly tacos which were both very delicious. Overall, it was a pretty fun experience but a bit on the pricey side.",

    "text": "I love tapas restaurants, so Soul is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I've been a few times, but it had been a while and the most recent time they changed up the menu a bit.   You want to come here with a group that isn't afraid up share so that you can try as many tapas as possible. I've never had the sushi, but I've heard it's good.   This time we went with the Asian glazed pork belly tacos, sashimi tuna tacos, salmon-o-pita, shells and cheese, fried Brussels sprouts, the flatbread, and the french fries with garlic herb salt, pacorino, and truffle oil.  Everything was amazing. The only thing I was a little disappointed by was the fries. They mostly just tasted like regular fries. The pork belly tacos are an absolute must try. They are my favorite dish in Charlotte.   The service is good. They bring the food out as it's ready. There can be a decent wait during normal hours, so I'd recommend coming at an off time or using the Nowait app.   If you haven't been already, I would highly recommend checking it out!",

You want to make sure you make a reservation. We had to wait about 5 minutes for our table to be ready. We just waited at the bar. I didn't drink anything but water so I can speak to the drinks but the food , omg the food. It was remarkable. It was affordable and the options are endless. You will definitely be able to find someone you want to eat no question. I have pictures of everything we got but you must try the Pork Belly Tacos. It was by far the best thing I had there and all I can say is wow. The service was perfect. The lighting is fairly dim and the tables are close together to provide a more intimate setting .",

    "text": "Wow!! Soul Gastrolounge is PHENOMENAL!! If you're looking to eat there around 7:30ish, I would recommend joining the waitlist around 5:45 PM. We arrived about 10 minutes early and were able to spend some time at the bar. The staff is very accommodating and friendly! While there is definitely space at the bar to eat, it's very easy to get one of their delicious cocktails while waiting for a table. I'm normally the type of person who likes sweeter cocktails, but the Cardinal & Sparrow is now one of my favorite cocktails, purely due to how refreshing it is.  Once we were seated, the waiter helpfully recommended the Fried Goat Cheese with Bruschetta starter (pictured), which was rich and delicious. For its fame, we ordered the Pork Belly Tacos. While the pork belly was good, we weren't very impressed with the watermelon salsa, but it may have been because the watermelon wasn't quite ripe enough. The Saganaki was a little tart in my opinion, but others in our party loved it.  We ordered the Sashimi Tuna Tacos (pictured) and the Lamb Lollipops (pictured), which are a must and among our favorites, along with the goat cheese. The lollipops were some of the most tender, best seasoned lamb we've ever tasted. Finally, we ordered a Red Dragon Roll to get a taste of some of the well known sushi from Soul. This was an amazing roll!! I would consider it to be the best roll I've found in Charlotte after being here for a year. I would die happy eating at Soul Gastrolounge everyday.",

They're so simple, pieces of pork belly and watermelon salsa wrapped in a tortilla.

On Saturday we got there at 530p (opens at 5p) with no wait and were seated on the patio. Matt was our server and he was fantastic with recommending options and explaining the menu. We tried some things off the sushi menu which were fantastic: 'Joe Cool' sushi special roll, blue fin tuna, hamachi jalapeno. We also tried a trio of dips: spicy feta, white bean and the tzatziki dip...all were fantastic. We also had the recommended pork belly tacos which were BEYOND CRAZY AMAZING! For dessert we had the featured cupcake and the filo dough wrapped banana and Nutella bites. Everything was fantastic and with the wait times, you just have to deal with it because the food is awesome.",

    "text": "First time at Soul on Monday and was impressed! They had a good selection of food on their menu. Something for everyone. I wouldn't recommend coming here on an empty stomach as waits are pretty lengthy (we waited over an hour after being quoted a 45 min wait for 5 people) and since it is a tapas place, plates are generally small and you could rack up a pretty big bill.   I ordered:  Chimichurri beef skewers : They come with 3 small skewers with about 4 pieces of meat on them along with the chimichurri sauce. The sauce is full of flavor and rich! You'll want to drown your beef in it.   Sashimi Tuna Tacos : 3 to a plate. Burst of flavors, I tell ya! Tuna was def fresh and the marinated cucumber adds such a great taste to it.  Pork Belly Tacos : A little disappointed that they only come with 2 a plate (for $12/plate -_-) but man, that pork belly is AMAZING! I can see why it's such a hit there. Although, I wasn't a fan of the \"watermelon salsa\" because of the slightly pickled taste, I absolutely loved it. The glaze on the pork belly is to die for. So sweet and delicious!  Korean BBQ Wings: Talk about a kick to the friggin' face! I was really surprised how spicy the wings were after taking a lick of the sauce. After you get through that first taste, these wings are delicious! They had a slight taste of gochujang, korean hot pepper paste (hence: korean bbq), which is probably what gives it such a kick. This was definitely my favorite plate!  Sushi was just above average, but not that impressive.   Unfortunately, they ran out of the dessert we wanted (their bread pudding) so I can't speak too much on that behalf except that I was just sad that I was not able to try it :(   Aside from being misquoted a wait time, the ambiance of the restaurant is perfect for a chill night out, service is good and food is definitely something to try. Can't wait to go back and try more items off the menu!",

    "text": "So ... My fiance and I researched places all over Charlotte.  We wanted to go some where we would have thoroughly enjoyed.   To our dismay we were greeted by the host with scoffing and contempt. My whole party and our friends felt unwelcomed. We were not even offered drink or food menus while we were clenching through our egregious wait time. We were not served.  It's not Studio 54 people. It felt like we were pretty much just asked to leave. (Not directly.  Indirectly in a micro aggressive fashion . ) I heard exciting things about this place.  Be advised even on a late evening on a Thursday the service can be subpar.  We talked to a manager before we just left and went to spend our out of town money down stairs at a local bar. Please note: I don't believe Soul is wheelchair accessible either.  It's up a flight of stairs.  (Which we had to figure out after guessing. )",

Menu has a lot of sushi, which we didn't try. The pork belly items were great. The mix of food is intentionally diverse but could benefit from more focus IMHO.",

The only thing we both really enjoyed was the pan con tomate....we ordered the Ramen hoping it would taste exceptional and my husband said it tasted like a Ramen concoction he's mad himself in the past. I'm giving it 3 stars because the staff was friendly, the winter mule was delicious and the food came out pretty darn fast but we won't be returning.",

I do not recommend this place with a big group of friends. Try to avoid the crowds on Friday and Saturday. Some of my favorite dinners at Soul have been during the work week when it is a little quieter.  This is the sort of place where you can dress up at. You don't have to- but no one will look at you strange if you decided to go all out.  The food is delicious. The Soul Roll is my favorite sushi in town. The fries are INCREDIBLE. The Lamb Lollipop will make you forget about lambs being cute and instead you will find lambs tasty.   Ideally- go here with 4 friends. Share food together.   The cocktails are always incredible. Adam is a creative bartender. If you see him- ask him to make you something unique- he usually tries to use local ingredients and it is not always on the menu.",

    "text": "Yes, there is a wait.  And there is a major reason there is a wait.  BECAUSE THE FOOD HERE IS FREAKING DELICIOUS!!  I went here with a group, and we decided to devour everything in our path.  Here are some of the must haves:  1.) The Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos.....are you kidding me??  These were some of the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth.  I could take a bath in that glaze.  And topped with watermelon....who was the genius who came up with that?  I want to marry that person.  2. Sashimi Tuna Tacos.  Prior to eating here, I wanted nothing to do with raw anything.  I am a changed woman after having had these tacos.  Between these and the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos, this could have been my whole meal and I would have gone home happy.  But there is more.....  3. Fried Brussel Sprouts..... fan-freaking-tastic.  Maybe not the most exciting thing to order, but so delicious all the same.  4. The dips.  Oh yum, the dips.  We had tzatziki, babaganoush, and white bean dip.  With crisp pita chips.  No, I don't weigh 500 pounds.  But after having to physically sit on my hands so I wouldn't lick these dips from my fingers, I probably should.  5. I was told that this place has some of the best sushi in the city.  So of course I had to order a roll.  And I was not disappointed.  I got the Red Dragon Roll, and one of the others in my group got the Dancing Tuna Roll.  Orgasm in my belly.     6. Various members of my group got different types of skewers.  Chicken, chimchurri beef, and gyros.  Now while I didn't try all of these personally, the fact that these skewers disappeared into various bellies within minutes of hitting the table likely speaks volumes as to how good they were.    7.  OH MY GOD, THE TRUFFLE FRIES.  THE MOTHER-FREAKING TRUFFLE FRIES.   My only caveat is that we were so full by the end that we could not possibly fit in another bite and so did not get to try dessert.  But it's okay because I will be back very very soon to eat my way through the rest of the menu.    This place is absolutely, 100% worth waiting for a table.  Spend the wait by going to the bar for one of their cocktails, the Nude Beach and the Cucumber Mule are so delicious and refreshing that you may just forget that you went there to eat......though I wouldn't recommend that.  Ask for Matt as a server, if nothing I mentioned above sounds appealing (and if it doesn't, just forget about going, because you obviously have no taste), then Matt will definitely recommend something on the menu that will have you licking your plate, he knows his stuff for sure.",

I have been generally impressed with the quality of food, (have tried many specials as well as house favorites) have enjoyed the unique cocktails as well as the creativity of the bartenders. Their location is in Plaza-Midwood neighborhood in an old building which provides the perfect atmosphere for Soul's unique vibe.  The downside of Soul is that it is very small AND pretty crowded. The staff is a bit picky about where small groups can or cannot sit as well as those who intend to eat food vs. just have drinks. I find their logic to be flawed at times as I remember an incident where I came right after opening (to an empty restaurant) and was not allowed to grab a table. I'd suggest they go with the flow and err on the side of satisfied regulars. I'll caulk that one up to a one-off incident and hopefully not the norm.   All of this said, I love Soul and hope they continue to serve things up in their unique and cool way.",

The bar was great and bartender made me a really unique cocktail after hearing that I'm a fan of Deaths Door. He used DD Gin, St.  Germaine, celery bitters, lemon and cracked black pepper garnish. It wasn't my kind of drink but I really loved it! Very inventive and flavorful. The food was excellent. Sushi that was super fresh, awesome ponzu. The pork belly watermelon tacos were stupid delicious and I tried Foie Gras for the first time. It was very buttery and extremely fatty but I enjoyed the tapas portion on a flakey mini roll. The avocado stack was my favorite. Elements of guacamole were present but it was a sliced avocado with minimal extras a super flavorful thin citrus dressing. Our table of 6 ordered an obscene amount of small plates and I cannot remember everything we ordered but I can say absolutely everything was amazing. Inventive, fresh, creative, executed well-- the wait staff and bartender were all super cool and chill. Not overly expensive and accommodating. What's not to love about this place?",

Unfortunately, we have decided never to go back due to the consistently and rather shockingly nasty attitudes of the host staff. We have experienced it ourselves, as well as seeing it directed at other guests. On almost every visit, we have seen at least one party take their name off the list due to the rudeness of the hostess. Normally, when I read a review like this one, I take it with a grain of salt because I have worked in the restaurant business and I know how rude the customers themselves can be, but I assure you that neither we nor the others we have observed being treated rudely have done anything to bring it on ourselves. There is simply no food that is good enough to be worth this kind of disrespect. For good food AND friendly staff, walk a block in either direction to go to The Diamond or to Dish or, for sushi, take a quick drive to Niko. All of these places have food that is just as good and staff that DON'T treat you like the pile of dog poo they just stepped in.",

    "text": "My heart and soul belong here. This place was the reason I moved into Plaza Midwood. The food is creative with surprising combinations of flavors and styles. The drinks are well-crafted and curated for quality. Soul has a quality that can't be imitated anywhere else. The mix is always intriguing with neighborhood hipsters, uptown sophiscates, local yokels, and out-of-towners. It is great to come here with friends,yet intimate enough for a date. It is one of the few places you can come alone and blend with the scene. It gets packed on the weekends so be ready for a wait, but it is fun to people watch in the meantime. My tip is to come earlier in the week because there are great djs every night. I loved my Monday nights with my boyfriend. We enjoyed the soulful spin of the dj and savoured our conversations without the frivolity of weekender distractions. I've since moved out state and miss my Soul.",

I've not had anything bad here.  Sushi is wonderful and love the option of ordering several tapas plates to share.  Cupcakes for dessert - yum!  The decor is posh but the interior is small and can be very tight at times.  Always had good service here.",

    "text": "When I walked into to Soul Gastrolounge, one word came to mind... Asheville. It felt just like I was in downtown Asheville eating at one of the fun and laid back restaurants that makes that city so different from Charlotte. I love going to a restaurant where you know it will not be replicated literally 20 miles away, no chain feeling here. Soul has a unique menu with lots to choose from. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are fun so that you can order a variety with friends when you go. I would highly recommend the Tuna Taco, that was my favorite. There were so many tasty items I had trouble narrowing it down which often times I have trouble finding anything on the menu. Try this place out and you won't be disappointed! If you love dining in Asheville's restaurants you will feel right at home.",

I don't make it here often enough, mainly because I drop a pretty penny whenever I do visit. It's too easy, because I want it all! Dress up or dress down, go grunge or glam, and you'll fit in. Perfect for an intimate date night during the week or a group of fun friends on a weekend night, if you don't mind standing room and a loud DJ. You will not be disappointed by anything on the menu!",

    "text": "After a number of friends recommended Soul, I decided to give it a try. Atmosphere is good, especially if you're lucky enough to sit inside at one of the \"living room\"-like areas. We sat outside, but no problems there -- the weather was great and the view of the city was nice.   Service was below average. Sure, it was busy, but that's not my problem, is it? Our waitress seemed exasperated when we asked questions about the menu -- to the point that on her first engagement with us she simply walked away when it was apparent we didn't know what we wanted yet. I would have left at that moment, but I didn't want to ruin the evening for everyone else.   On to the food:   They should either remove the sushi from the menu or hire someone that knows how to make it. We had yellowtail with scallions and hamachi with jalepenos. Both were unremarkable, bland and the plating was just wrong.   The white bean and goat cheese dip was mainly white beans (did they even put any goat cheese in it?). Bland, boring and criminal given that it was unseasoned and lacking goat cheese. I can open a can of white beans at home and won't forget to doctor it up so at least it tastes somewhat interesting.   Anchovy fries were OK. Saganaki -- same. Mediterranean wings were nicely done. The lone excellent dish was the fried oysters -- lightly battered, delicately fried and juicy inside.   My main advice to the operators of Soul would be to hire waiters that can handle stress and that at least try to pretend they like their customers. Good, personable service can cure a lot of ills.",

On weekends, however, the wait for a table gets too crazy (although you can head to 22 below while you wait, which is a new plus), the service can suffer, and it gets way too boom-boom club for my taste.  I also have noticed a steady increase in their prices since they've opened, but it can still be an affordable place if you order carefully.  That aside, I've had pretty good food here over the past year or so.  I think there was a period--maybe in the summer of this year--where they missed the mark a few times when I visited, but I'm happy to say that on my most recent visits, it's been quite nice.    My standbys usually are the mini-Cheeseburgers, the Cheese Plate (mainly for the quince, which is delicious ,but I always have to ask for more bread), the truffle fries, and most of the sushi rolls.    So, enjoy Soul, but I recommend it during the off hours.",

Every time my girls come down from the east coast, this is a place on the list that we never skip. The ambience at night is like NYC restaurant, funky music, live dj and all kinds of food - sushi to steak. The wait is also similar to hopping restaurant in NYC. Seriously you can go in at 10 PM and still have to wait 30 mins for a table (this did happen btw) But the wait is worth it. Make sure to always get the truffle fries! The kabobs are damn good and so are sliders. But their lamb chops certainly are my fav. We have even done brunch there and the menu is almos tthe same and so is the wait lol. Bt the bloody mary's make up for it!! Definitely a fun place to take your friends...be prepared for a wait, make sure to take in some drinks and just enjoy it all.",

Fine no worries, an hour came and went and we had show tickets so we went into ask what the hold up was...only to be told another 45 minutes.  WTF?  Hipster host who couldn't give a flip told us 'well we never can estimate a wait time,'  our response was Olive Garden seems to have no problem so surely Soul could manage to figure it out.  We looked inside and saw a four topper open and three two toppers....when asked why we can't have one of those tables we were told that 'well we had three people and there's only one table in the whole restaurant that they can seat three people at'  Cue the what the hell looks on our faces.  I mean seriously Soul.  You are trying way too hard and running off customers.  So evidently they refuse to seat a party of three at a four topper, or to push two, two top tables together.  So after wasting all of this time we went over to PIzza Peel and wolfed down our food.  Luckily we still made it to the Brian Regan show on time!  I am never ever stepping foot into Soul again.",

Once that was taken, it took even longer to put our food order in...and as you can probably guess, it didn't exactly come out on time either...  Aside from all of that, the food was good...not great. Had some skewers, white bean dip, buffalo wings, and the fact that I can't remember what else we ordered probably says a lot...The white bean and goat cheese dip was not that great however, if it had been served hot, it might have been better. It was lukewarm...  We sat outside which was nice (but you definitely knew you were in Charlotte--NOT NY...) There were lots of drunk kids entering and exiting and an extremely inappropriate couple (by couple, I mean something that comes out of a Jersey Shore episode) who may have actually fell over the balcony, together, had they stayed a minute longer...management observed their behavior and said nothing...until they shattered a glass over the balcony.   Even if the food was better, I don't think I'd return. Most uncomfortable experience coupled with poor service= not worth it to me!  Oh, and by the way, a friend of mine tried to book this place for her birthday and the MANAGER told her he couldn't accommodate a reservation for ten--EVER...like, he said he just could not a reserve a table for her...interesting....Why did I still come here after knowing this?! Don't know.  Take your money elsewhere!",

Pork tacos - good but personally I'd like a little more sauce 2. Arugula flat bread - very well done! 3. Chicken skin nachos -  nope didn't work for me. The lady warned us but we decided to give it a try. Not very wise unless chicken skin is your thing 4. Bread pudding - oh my! It's tasted like a brownie but I'm not going to complain.   Here's some additional details from a very vocal pair of neighbors - wings were to die for and the spinach pastry / spanakopita was the best they'd eaten. They couldn't stop oohing and aaing. Haha.",

    "text": "This was an incredible and worth-while gem of Charlotte. It's small and eclectic and wouldn't be out of place in a hipster-Brooklyn setting (including the 2-hour wait time). We especially liked their style of serving the dishes as they were prepared rather than being overwhelmed with all the food all at once (it also meant that we could start eating fairly quickly since we were super hungry!).  Here's a helpful outline of how to do Soul Gastrolounge right:  First, download and use the NoWait app to secure your place in line at this restaurant. It saved us over an hour of waiting.   Second, you'll need to find parking as there's no parking lot. We went on a Saturday night around 7:30pm and we're only *just* lucky to have found a spot on the same street.   Third, it's helpful to know that the gastrolounge is on the second story - not street level. This confused us at first when we were looking for it. When you get there, order some drinks as the wait will still be a few more minutes. Their original cocktails are both unique and fantastic.  Finally, the food! Since it's tapas-style you'll want to order several dishes per person. The server was incredibly helpful to recommend dishes that were perfectly paired and balanced so that we didn't order too many heavy items or too many light dishes. The highlight was the dragon sushi and the berry-cupcake with red-wine cream frosting. We also had flatbreads, fried goat-cheese bruschetta, and Asian-glazed pork-with-watermelon tacos. It was out of this world delicious! My partner also ordered the skewers with chimichanga and enjoyed them, but I thought they were just a bit too fatty and chewy.   All-in-all we had a great time here. The servers were knowledgeable, the staff was friendly and attentive, the ambiance was relaxed Southern hipster-chic. We would most definitely return here!",

Don't get me wrong the food isn't terrible it just isn't great. You know I am expecting awesome food when I am paying $10 for 10 brussel sprouts. Unfortunately it just didn't live up to the hype. I would go back for the ambiance - let's be real it's an awesome date spot in terms of being comfy and cozy. However not only was the food lackluster, but the portions are definitely smaller and the price tag larger than the Soul Gastrolounge of yesteryear.",

Just go ahead and get over it. Sure, it would be nice. You know what would also be nice? If they gave me free cocktails, but they don't do that either. See, it sounds pretty ridiculous now doesn't it? Expect a wait. There's a wait for a reason. Go early and put your name on the list, then walk downstairs to Twenty-Two or over to Workman's Friend for a drink. They'll text you when your table is ready.  If you looked through the user pictures on here, you've probably figured out that the pork belly tacos are the most popular item. I agree, they're my number #1 at Soul. I also like the tuna tacos, soul roll, and hamachi with jalapeno. My most recent adventure here was with the lovely Sarah C and we felt it was our duty to order the giant shells and cheese stuffed with pork belly. I can't think of anything on the menu that I've tried and didn't like. My roommate and her bestie love the shrimp ceviche. Cocktail menu is also great. I usually always start with a Tito's Cucumber Mule.   Price-wise, this is a place where you can very easily spend a lot of money. It's easy to get caught up in the delicousness and order a bunch of plates. Sarah and I split four small plates and three cocktails... $87 before tip.   Only other thing you really need to know: parking blows. The JLC WearHouse across the street closes at 7pm, so I'll park there or the breakfast place next door to it. Just make sure to pay attention to all the signs in this area before you park.",

    "text": "When I think of a classic, modern Gastrolounge (calling it a mere Gastro-pub being a step backward from the most cutting-edge trendy) I conjure the image of Soul Gastrolounge in my mind. Eclectic decoration, a DJ bar, trendy fusion dishes, and more abound in a restaurant that we'll live up to the hype. And that's really saying something because two hours before I sat down in the place I mentioned where I was headed and was instantly commended on my choice and told to \"try the wings, they're delectable!\"  The setting: coming in as a party of two, I was seated at the DJ bar. Now, I was a little hesitant about this because I figured the music's volume would quash any conversation, but I was pleasantly surprised how mellow the DJ really was. I could hear everything my dinner guest was saying!  Visually, it's a very fun place to be: you've got a giant peacock, lounge chairs, cool posters, and more. It's a feast for the eyes and for the ears, I thought the DJ was picking great choices (though it was a lot of Micheal Jackson and that's controversial in a whole lot of ways we won't get into.) The service was absolutely fantastic! Our waiter was knowledgeable, quick, and friendly.   The food: guys, it really is just ~so~ good. We had the hummus of the day, which was Paprika flavored. I never would have made it on my own, but dang if that paprika didn't give the hummus a delicious, Smokey zip! We then had the aforementioned wings (Southern flavored) and they really were crispy to perfection, paired with a zesty dipping sauce with a kick. Then we went for the flatbread which was garlicky, basil heaven on earth (no vampires will chase me tonight). After that we scooped the Rocky Mountain Oysters, which I've always wanted to try, thought I won't tell you what part of the anatomy it is, and they also were a crispy delight. Say what you want about Soul Gastrolounge, but they sure know how to fry something to absolute crunch perfection! We finished with the lemon chicken skewer, which was delicious, but nothing particularly thrilling.   All in all, I'd jump back in a heartbeat! This is exactly the trendy sort of place you think won't be worth it, but you'd be wrong on this count!",

We have tried many things on the menu and it is all good, but the highlights so far has been the pork belly tacos, the dirty south nachos, and the red dragon roll. The dirty south nachos are fried chicken skins with a cheese sauce with pickled okra. It is the number 1 thing here in my humble opinion. However, the pork belly taco is amazing. Served with a square of watermelon.  The red dragon roll the favorite sushi roll to my wife and I.  The drinks and cocktails are also amazing. I love their mules. It also has a great decor and atmosphere.  They have nice staff and the wait time to get your food ain't bad at all. However, if you do not get there right when they open at 5 pm, your wait time to get seated may be a while.  Like I said, I discussed my favorites, but everything I have had there is a winner.",

Parking can be tough but not impossible. We tried several different item. The hummus of the day was great (lemon/garlic), the pan con tomate was flavorful but a bit oily for me. The locals live the pork belly with infused watermelon which we tried. Very unique flavors that go well together so definitely recommend trying it. We also tried the ahi tuna taco tapas. The bluefin sashimi was so fresh and the portion size was definitely worth it. Lots of options to please anyone in your group.",

    "text": "This was my second trip to Soul Gastrolounge and I must admit I had a much better experience this time than the first. The first time I came here it was way too loud, service was mediocre, and the drinks we got were disappointing.  I'm glad I decided to come back for a second round. I'm not sure if it was just an off night the first time, if things have actually improved, or if it was the time of day we went, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself on a Friday evening trip around 7 PM.  FIRST of all, we were using the No Wait app and showed up about 5 minutes after our deadline to be pushed to the back of the line. The hostess was gracious enough to let it slide for us and we only had to wait another 10 minutes to get our table. Huge relief. Shoutout to the hostess for making our night better right off the bat.  I'm also happy to report that the drinks we ordered from the bar were cold, refreshing, and even though the bar was crowded, delivered in a timely manner!  To the food - We got the pan con tomate like the first time and again it delivered. We got the Queen Charlotte roll to share and again, it was just as amazing as the last time. Same goes for the pork belly tacos.  The new things we tried were the stuffed shells and the hoisin short ribs. The stuffed shells were SUPER rich and heavy and ended up being \"OK.\" The hoisin short ribs were my bite of the night. Exceptional.  The only thing I would suggest to the restaurant is to please for the love of God turn down the music just a tad. Other than that, very happy I decided to come back to Soul Gastrolounge! Will be back again.",

They do not take reservations so recommend coming at an off time or being prepared to wait!   We were seated at the bar and promptly ordered the cocktail spin off of a cherry coke float and it was delicious. We were slightly worried it'd be overly sweet but it was surprisingly mild and fun all at the same time.   The menu is vast and truly has something for everyone. The food comes out tapas style which is great for groups and allows you to get a taste of a variety of menu items. We decided on the grilled Caesar salad, pork belly tacos, goat cheese bruschetta and the flat bread all of which were incredible. The goat cheese bruschetta was hands down both of our favorite.   Can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Definitely worth the visit!",

One of the cheeses we couldn't even eat because it was insanely stinky. The lamb lollipops weren't bad but we have definitely had better. I was expecting more of the pork belly stuffed shells and cheese and those were also not impressive. So far our favorite tapas joint has been Good Food on Montford and have yet to find somewhere that beats it. We do not plan on returning to this restaurant.",

Free parking on the opposite corner. Must Try! Something on the menu of both food and drinks to suite everyone (except vegans, not as many options there).  Long version: My party of 3 and I ordered the following: Shrimp skewers Beef and Chimichurri skewer Gyro skewer Anchovy Fries Pork Belly tacos Fried goat cheese Dip Trio Mini Burgers Rocky Mountain Oysters Salmon o pita Korean bbq wings And the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.  For drinks: Nutty Professor, Winter Mule, and Barracuda-all of which were great. Favorite amongst those was the winter mule.   My favorites were the Garlic Shrimp skewers and the Salmon O Pita. Everything else was still really good but those 2, for me, were the best. I didn't care much for the hummus and babaganouj in the dip trio (tzaziki was really good though). I also didn't care much for the Rocky Mountain oysters but that's just because I was trying them for the first time and determined they are not for me. They were very well prepared though. Very crispy and flavorful breading and very tender.   Everyone talks about the pork belly tacos, and they are good, but the watermelon pieces we got were not very sweet and didn't provide as much contrast in flavor as in texture. They were still good but not my fave.  The Chocolate Bread Pudding was more of a large cupcake/brownie but has nothing to do with a bread pudding. Tasty...but not bread pudding.  Overall, we had a great experience. Everything is served as it gets prepared. Definitely meant to actually \"lounge\" and not dine and dash. Nice old school soul music playing, excellent service (I want to say his name was Mike).",

I wouldn't recommend traveling in a large crowd, but big enough to try multiple things for you to each nibble on one another's plate - LOL. If on a date, I would not recommend anything too serious. I'd reserve the space for casual convo, networking, good music, and good eats.   Oh - don't come starving. The food is served tapas style. I didnt realize I dropped into a Tapas Restaurant because the cocktails caught my eye first. Otherwise, the food was delicious. I tried the pork belly watermelon taco, fries, and wings. Yummy!

Those are always my baseline items, and definitely up to par.   I heard so much about the pork belly tacos, we had to get them. The watermelon looks odd, but adds to the overall flavor and texture. Pork belly was incredibly soft with just enough sauce.  The sushi rolls were as good as anywhere else I've had in Charlotte. Can't go wrong with any of them.   Dessert was okay, not the best. It didn't take away from the overall experience, so I'm looking forward to my the time.",

The ceviche was fun and the fry oysters was one of the best I have ever had, the batter was pretty fluffy, not exactly light but it has volume of air.  Need to try the pork and bone marrow next  4/24 Had 2 plates of fry oysters, not as great as last time but still great.

Small, stylish funky interior with a large bar (with a small deck with addl seating outside) - great place to take a date or significant other, they serve some of the best sushi and tapas in the Midwood area in my opinion. The lamb lollipops were my favorite but they have gotten just too expensive over the years. My recommendation if your are planning to go is to join the waitlist from their website as it is ALWAYS crowded, that will give you an idea of how long the wait is and get your name on the list before you get there (as they do not take no reservations). Menu recommendations - start with the Dip Trio, menu wise everything I've had is good but I've had the Lamb Lollipops, Southern fried oysters, Sticky Veal Shortribs, Dynamite, Spider, Dancing Tuna and/or Godzilla rolls, and the Chimichurri beef to name a few. Highly highly recommend!!",

Not sure of the name of it, but it was nothing of the sort and wouldn't really recommend it - it was very lemony and overall I just felt there wasn't much to it.    We ordered the pork belly tacos which were good but not great, truffle fries which could have been more flavorful imo, pan con tomate which I thought was excellent, Brussels sprouts which are good but also extremely fried, and this flamed cheese which was pretty decent as well.   Overall love the atmosphere here, it's not too loud which I appreciate, and food is served fairly quickly. Service is good as well.",

First of all, the atmosphere is killer.  Dive bar meets hipster meets club meets food truck meets I don't know what else.  It's edgy and comfortable all at the same time.  But the food.  Shared several rounds of small plates with a friend.  Pork belly tacos, pan con tomate, ahi tacos, some sort of bacon cream corn that fell from heaven, sushi that made me cry.  At some point we had dessert.  I could describe how they tasted, but I think I'll just stop and enjoy the memory again.  And plan my next trip.",

They don't take reservations so either go early or go late...if you go in between don't say I didn't warn you b/c you will wait and wait....and wait some more..only to be sat 6 inches from the next table. (Go downstairs to 22 and have a beer while you wait) Food is pretty good...service has always been awesome. It's a tad pricey but it's tapas....and it's the place to be seen..don't forget that. The last 2 times I ate there, I ate the sushi and it did NOT like me at all 6 hrs later so I won't be going back.",

I took my family and ordered so many things off the menu!  Our waitress was fun and friendly and helped recommend things for us to order. My favorite by far were the Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos.  I don't even like watermelon but the pork with it was truly amazing! My only complaint is the order comes with two small tacos so a bit pricey for what you get. The French Fries With Garlic-herb Salt, Pecorino & Truffle Oilwere truly something to behold I honestly have never had fries like them!  The Korean Bbq wings had great flavor sweet with a good amount of spice to them.  The Fried Brussel Sprouts also had good flavor and were worth ordering. The only bad thing I had was the Dirty South Nachos are basically fried crust in a sauce and they were basically nasty!  So all in all this place is worth going great food even if it is a little pricey for what you get.",

My friends and I ordered a variety of tapas, including hummus, chimichurri beef skewers, grilled cheese, fried meatballs and another I can't recall. It was all good but of all things, it was the grilled cheese that I enjoyed the most. It included provolone, mozzarella and kasseri cheeses. The kasseri made all the difference. It added a saltiness to the sandwich which really gave it great flavor.  The carrot cupcake was also quite tasty.   The service was friendly and very attentive, especially since the bartender was extremely busy. Cool atmosphere. I'll definitely return when I visit Charlotte again.",

    "text": "As visitors to Charlotte, we knew we wanted to eat somewhere exciting so we turned to Yelp for suggestions.  The #1 option was Soul Gastrolounge and I'm so excited we decided on this place!  I wasn't craving a huge meal and love tapas so I thought this place had the right set up for us.  The vibe is very cool, hangout with your friends while you drink and snack.  Kind of hipster but not over the top.  We chose to sit at the bar which was fun to kind of people watch and really take in the place, but they also have tables and couch/chair areas you can sit at also.  It is located in a area with a few other busy restaurants so you may have to park elsewhere and walk over.   We chose the gyro skewers, french fries and the special that night which was a smoked cod on a potato cake.  The skewers were great and the sauce was a nice compliment with its cool/fresh taste.  The fries were to die for and I had to tell my husband to stop hogging them all.  I didn't try the special, but my husband was a fan.  Overall everything we tried was great!  They bring out your table's item whenever they ready so it wasn't so much a \"ok now we can eat our meal\" situation.  The food is a little on the expensive side (which I've learned is kind of standard at tapas places) so this would be more ideal for a special occasion (date night, night out with friends, etc) rather than a regular night.  I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for something delicious with a nice atmosphere.",

The wait for a table inside was 90 minutes but for a table on their balcony we were seated immediately (it was hot out!).   I ordered their version of a Pisco sour to start. It was okay but probably not worth the $12 price tag. We ordered the white bean hummus dip, smoked salmon spanakopita and the bone marrow which were all fine but nothing to write home about. The pork belly and pickled watermelon tacos, however, were phenomenal. We would go back for those tacos alone.  The dessert menu was surprisingly limited for a gastrolounge -- kept only to cupcakes and ice cream -- so we passed.  All in all, we had a nice evening at Soul but don't think it lived up to the hype.",

I was a bit hungry and annoyed that we are waiting for a table this long on a weekday, but the wait was well worth it!  Our server was great, she recognized that it was our first time here and explained the menu and how it all worked with tapas and her recommendations.  She recommended that each of us (there were 3 of us in our group) order two plates.  We put in an order of edamame and we were off to the races!  I chose the Sashimi Tuna Tacos (heaven in 2 bites) and Shrimp Ceviche which was an awesome way to end the meal since it came out last.  My cohorts chose the special:  fried shrimp with alfreado linguine and a crunch roll;  and the other two plates were soul wings and sticky veal shortribs.  Everything was excellent.  It was fun having all the small plates and being able to try everything.  We were lucky enough to get an outside table and halfway through the meal it started raining, but they have covers that rolled down to keep the splashing to a minimum.  The inside looked pretty cool and loungy - not many tables inside (hence the wait), but overall I am definitely coming back here to try some more tapas!",

It's easier to get a spot to eat when it's just me and my girlfriend or with 1 other couple. If you have more than 4 in your party, you will definitely have a good wait on the weekends.  That being said, I don't mind a wait when I'm dining here because I'll either get one of their finely crafted cocktails or go downstairs to Twenty-Two (See my review).  Once I get a table...IT'S ON.  The restaurant is a fusion of American, Greek, and Japanese (well, sushi mainly).  It's tapas style and I'll usually order 2 small plates at a time to split.  It's a pretty interesting menu when you bring all 3 of these together.  My favorite dish is hands down the sashimi tuna tacos.  My eyes usually roll into the back of my head as I savor each bite.  They just taste so fresh and smooth.  We always get the cheese plate to nibble on throughout the meal, and it's massive...a really good value.  The spanikopita is a favorite and we always get a roll of sushi.  They have great sushi.  The quality is there and you can taste it. They have a great brunch too, love the pimiento mac n' cheese.  They also have these breakfast pierogis with fried bologna and maple syrup.  That dish is out of this world.  I love the selection of music (very loungy) and the patio overlooks the skyline of Charlotte.  Soul was voted one of the city's best restaurants for a reason.",

    "text": "If you ask yourself what you want for dinner and think \"I would really like some good fusion food, but slightly overpriced in a cramped dark hipster-ish setting with mediocre service.\" This is your place.  Be ready to wait! When I say wait I mean wait like 4 hours for a table! They don't take reservations which is a pain, but if your party is small and you get there early it can be tolerable. If you get there on a Saturday night with more than 2 people you will be waiting forever. My suggestion is put your name down and go to whiskey warehouse or common market and have a drink where you are not so cramped, then walkover when your table is ready.   Went on a Saturday once and put our name down for a table for 8 at 6:30, we were not seated until 11:15.   Food overall its good, however I don't get what all the hype is about...they put watermelon on some pork belly and you would think they invented the PB&J, it's good don't get me wrong, but common people it's not that good.  Place is great if you and the significant other want a date night, but I wouldn't come here with a group of friends it's just way too tiny and cramped. Not to mention the food comes out when it's ready not all at once, and in a group its strange when some people have food and some people don't.",

    "text": "Soul Gastrolounge has gotten Way too full of itself.  I have never been treated so rudely at any other restaurant, ever.   I have been to Soul at least a handful of times.  I've always enjoyed it.  However, the last time I attempted to dine there I was treated to a truly shocking display of rudeness.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, so when I was told it was going to be 90 minutes I wasn't the least bit surprised. However, I did find it a bit odd that that I was 3rd in line and that it was still going to be that long before I was seated.   I hopped around Plaza Midwood to kill some time.  90 minutes later I called and somehow I was still 3rd in line.  This defied logic.  2.5 hours later I called and was told that I was fourth in line.  Uhmmm... how is it possible to move backward in the line after waiting 2.5 hours?  When I posed this question I was very rudely told that it was my fault for not having downloaded a seating app.  At this point it was so late that other restaurants in the area were no longer serving.    I had out of town friends with me and this was their introduction to Charlotte.  Never in my life have I been treated so poorly at a restaurant.  Soul will certainly be just fine without my business (which they will never get again).  The food is good, but with the ever improving Charlotte restaurant scene, Soul Gastro may lose some of its following if this level (lack of) customer service continues.",

    "text": "This is my first Yelp review. But as a decade long front-house restaurant employee who currently works in a 4-star restaurant, I tend to have a more critical eye than the average Yelper. Whether you're fan or not of Soul is immaterial. You should read this (atypical) review regardless.  Within the last two weeks, a friend of mine called Soul to place a takeout order of their Shrimp Ceviche. As I'm en route to pick it up for her, (coming across town 30 mins to do so) she promptly called back to tell me that they wouldn't allow her to buy that specific item for \"Take-Out\" due to {insert erroneous/illogical reason here from an employee}. The problem was, I've already ordered that item \"To-Go\" before.  On principle, I was perturbed. Saw I called personally and asked to speak to a leadership position.   I was told [paraphrased]; that the head chef didn't think that particular dish was appropriate to serve as a \"To-Go\" item, as its quality (and his work) would be devalued upon consumption if not on site.  As someone who eats out 1-2 times a week, I can honestly appreciate the sentiment. Nonetheless, I ultimately felt that if I'm a paying guest for a product (that's in stock) I should be able to receive said item without a hurdle. Cash for product = service, I felt.  Once explained, a female manager (pardon me, as I can't recall her name) promptly and kindly addressed my issue and told me it'll be ready in 20 minutes. I showed up...it was ready...and I left. The food (as always from Soul) was phenomenal, even in a box on a 20 min car ride.  So here's your bottom line...  If you're on the fence about going there, don't be. Trust me, just go there. This place is awesome. Prior to this story, I've been there 20 times and always left happy. Their food and their cocktails (particularly their bourbon list, personally) are worth your time and your money. It can be a first-date or a chill night with your main. Their ambiance covers all bases and their menu covers all tastes. A real staple for the community of Charlotte.   P.S. Pork Belly Tacos...",

    "text": "5 Stars for creative ambition in place where there really aren't that many places just trying to come up with different things so for that I'm going to break it down dish by dish. Still execution could be better and I wouldn't necessarily wait again for it.  Souther Style Nachos - Fried chicken skins with cheese. This should be a grand slam in the you like rich food at a biological level, yet the chicken skins get soggy quick and the cheese congeals. There has to be a way to make the cheese less solid and the chicken more so.  Gyro - Not as good as town tavern, maybe better than showmars but that's no standard to go by.  Southern Fried Chicken Wings - these were legitimately great. Good size, juicy through the middle, great breading. Get them if you go.  Pork Belly Tacos - I like the watermelon on it but the texture is much to hard. The whole point of pork belly is to have it be incredibly soft. If you over cook it, or cook it at too high of a heat and it gets rough you might as well eat a healthier cut of pork.  Serrano and Machego Crustini - Bread was too thick and not toasted enough resulting in a pretty doughy concoction.  Anchovy Fries - Chinese people do this with smelt and it works a lot better. Anchovies don't have the consistency to not get soggy and really just end up being too soggy. I grew up eating these at home and was really disappointed   Lamb Meatballs - Just too tough. Probably needs more bread and less time in the oven.  Flatbread - Too rich, not enough texture.  These reviews may sound too hash but if you're going to try to do new an interesting things basic execution is paramount. The positive is that these are all problems that can be fixed with practice while good ideas don't' come out of nowhere.",

The pork belly tacos were a tad too salty for me but the watermelon really toned the saltiness down and was a great compliment to the pork belly. We also enjoyed the ramen bowl, different but delicious. Another great dish was the nachos, fried chicken skin with pimento cheese. I never had anything like that before, it was definitely worth all the calories.  Washed everything down with the cucumber water that they provide which was the perfect closure to the night.",

The bartender (long hair and tattoos) was an excellent host and made all sorts of recommendations for things to try as well as places to check out in the city. What was supposed to be 2 tapas turned into about 4 or 5 over the next 2 hours and several drinks, all of which were outstanding.   The pork belly tacos were the stand out item but everything was amazing. The atmosphere is very chic and upscale, which I should have looked up in advance since I came in wearing jeans and sneakers but no one minded. Overall a great experience and definitely a place worth coming back too.",

I loved the idea of tapas, because it was small samples of anything you wanted to try, so I could cram several of those plates in my face hole. We tried so many things, I can't even tell you how many plates we had in front of us. EVERYTHING was delicious and had flavor like I'd never tried.   The atmosphere was laid back, and everyone in there was friendly. It was artsy and mood lit inside and active and bright outside. Soul is like a hidden gem, that you don't know about until someone tells you how amazing it is. It's like being part of the fight club, except you're allowed to talk about it, and nobody fights.. err something... yeah.   Seriously I don't think you can go wrong with this place. There is nothing bad on the menu. At ALL. If I make it back down to Charlotte, I will have to head back into Soul for a quick bite. You Charlotte peeps are soooo lucky, with all that tasty food!!! :)",

    "text": "Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. They have creative and unique menu items, tapas (small plates for you Anglophones), interesting cocktails and the best bartenders in town. Getting up to the bar is like a game for me and I love it. How many people can I squeeze by to get into the prime seating?  The vibe at Soul is upscale, most nights there is a DJ, it's dark and a little loud, but somehow still pulls itself off as a speakeasy-like atmosphere. Definitely come here with a small group. Big groups will never get seated -- just not enough space. Sharing tapas is the best way to go here. I have never eaten a meal here without sharing their fries, a generous portion of garlicky, perfectly delicious fries. Shoe string style if you were wondering. I, also, highly recommend their sushi. The Soul roll is one of my faves, not overly spicy, so don't let those jalapenos scare you off.   If you want interesting cocktails you have come to the right place. Check out their menu with tons of house favorites (Basil Smash) or tell Adam or one of the other awesome bartenders what you like and they will mix up something special just for you.   On most nights and ALL weekends you will wait at Soul, for sometimes up to an hour, but it is totally worth it. Elbow in at the bar and order some cocktails and hummus to keep you happy while you wait. If you can snag a place on the patio on a night with good weather, you have definitely hit the jackpot. Perfect view of the Charlotte skyline. Soul is a great date spot -- nothing like getting to know someone by sharing food.   Soul has always been an ultra hip spot in the sea of a semi-hip place, but now that Plaza Midwood is growing up, I think Soul compliments its neighbors well (ie: Peculiar Rabbit and Twenty Two). If you have someone you want to impress in Charlotte, go ahead and head over to Soul Gastrolounge.",

    "text": "I went here with some people I met through one of my dinner groups.  Having only driven by and never stopped it was time to experience another place I've heard such rave reviews on.  First off, it's not a place that is good for the differently abled as it is on the 2nd floor and access is via the steps outside.    Up the steps, you see a few tables outside on a metal catwalk.  Inside it's fairly dark with mood lighting.  There's a bar that extends to the small kitchen and sushi prep station.  To the left if a DJ area and more comfortable seating.  To the right are 3 booths with high backs so you cannot see the tables next to you.   Our group of 5 was seated here.   There is an interesting selection of wines.  One of my friends and I were intrigued by the Velvet Devil Merlot so we both ordered this.  Good stuff.   Now for ordering.  We ordered in spurts.  Tried a few plates and then added more 2 times, trying everything from a sampler to a cheese platter, then moving on to proteins with the ham plate, the shrimp ceviche, the shrimp sashimi tuna tacos, the spanish chorizo,   Everything was tasty but I think my favorite was the sashimi tacos which is way outside of my comfort zone.  The spanish chorizo almost had the texture of beef jerky,  There's nothing wrong with that, I just wasn't expecting it.  Same with the Shrimp saviche.  I wasn't expecting it to be so saucy with the coconut milk.  This is definitely a good place to go with a group because you get to sample everything,  And it does fill you up.  None of us had room for dessert.    The place is relatively inexpensive.  After 2 drinks each, and about 10 different tapas, we decided to split everything evenly 5-ways and it only ended up being $26 each.    The only flaw was with our server.  When we wanted to order more food, we didn't see her for about 15 minutes and had to flag her down.  This cost the 5 star rating.",

I'm sorry? This is Plaza.  *joined some friends who were on the patio dining and when the server came around multiple times, she didn't even acknowledge us. Even when I started acting childish and saying I'm so thirsty as a hint. I did this because when I tried to flag her down before, she straight up walked away. *Get dripped on with rain water since the plastic covering for the patio wasnt wanting to cooperate. I hope it was rain water at least.  Their sushi rocked when I went the first few times and I would love to have it again but it wasn't in the sushi stars.  Oh Soul, you were like a bad boy crush.

The customer service from hostess to bartenders to servers at the table. 2. The food is consistently GOOD & we've eaten all over the menu from front to back. From Tapas to full plates to sushi to sides. 3. The drinks  are very consistent in flavor and alcohol levels to ice The one NEGATIVE consistency: 1. THE WAIT & not accepting reservations  The plus to the only negative consistency I have is that they offer table places using the NoWait app which is new and a HUGE plus. Lastnight my husband and I were at a concert and was able to put our name down in line while enjoying the last two acts because it specified that we had 89 - 110 minutes before our table would be ready and showed us that there were 24 parties before us.  Let's Get down to the goodies. The food is not complex it's straight forward and GOOD. Some of our go to's are: Sashimi tacos  Fried oysters  Garlic shrimp skewers  Lamb lollipops  Beef skewer  A number of sushi rolls which we tried the Godzilla lastnight and wasn't a huge fan due to the cream cheese. I asked if they could only put 1% on and was told YES however they put 101%. It was too creamy and we ended up picking out the cream cheese per piece before eating.  Our server was super cool and he noticed all the cream cheese on our plates and once we ordered dessert Chocolate Bread pudding (which was amazing) he brought it out and informed us that he was comping it due to the mix up with the cream cheese which we Super cool as we didn't complain we just took the cream cheese out and ate the roll. This place is the perfect DateNight spot with the dim lighting and cool music. It's also a cool spot to catch up with friends and enjoy some drinks and small plates.  If you are going for the first time please note that it's not accessible friendly as you have to climb the black fire escape black cast iron stairs to enter. Don't quote me on this because maybe there is a secret elevator that no one knows about but I've never seen it or I inquired about it. I'll find out and update my review if such a thing exist.",

We were told outdoor seating wait time was 15-20 minutes, however the wait ended up being about 40 minutes. The host apologized and thanked us for waiting patiently. Our waiter was fantastic and extremely polite and everything was brought out within proper time. I would give this place a 4/5 stars for my waiter if the food tasted better.  FOOD: The specials item on Monday was Red Dragon sushi (not sure of the exact name, but it had tuna) with chicken dumplings. This is more than enough for one person, especially if you're a woman and hungry :) BUT it was not mind blowing. Keep in mind you're ordering sushi at a restaurant with random menu items. I had also ordered the Midsummer Night cocktail that tasted very watered down. All in all, I would come here for the pretty lights and good music, but food and drinks were just okay.",

    "text": "Soul is one of the most unique, yet highly recognized restaurants in Charlotte. It's located off Central Avenue, which is quite eclectic, yet boasts a variety of great restaurants and food options.  Soul is one of those places you seek to take out of towners, or \"newbies\" to Charlotte. The menu changes occasionally, yet there are some mainstay choices that are always available and you HAVE to try (i.e. pork belly watermelon tacos).  Soul is a very small space, which gives it a cozy, friendly and intimate setting. They have a handful of tables, or you could find yourself on stools sitting closely to other couples. There is even a lounge area with couches and comfy chairs. If you're lucky enough to snag one of few tables on the porch outside, you have a gorgeous view of the city skyline. They also have a small bar where you can have a drink while you wait. While they don't take reservations, they have started taking down your cell phone number so you can check out some other places nearby (Peculiar Rabbit, Bistro La Bon) and they will text you when your table is ready.   Soul is mostly known for their tapas style dishes, and they offer great sushi too. I've been a handful of times, though this was before I was into the phase if photographing my food. Some of my favorite dishes include the pork belly tacos (no brainer), the lam lollipops, the fried brussel sprouts, fried oysters, eggplant parm, grilled cheese, housemade gyro, and any of their current specials for dessert (They usually have outrageous combos of cupcakes that are so amazing).   Things I wouldn't recommend - dirty south nachos (the fried chicken \"chips\" just weren't up to soul's standard), salads. There are too many other good things at soul, so I tell people to stay away from the salads. I'm a dietitian so I'm all about some additional veggies, but take my word on this.",

    "text": "When it comes to edgy culinary experiences in a unique setting, Soul has been on the top of my Charlotte list for quite some time. I'll start off by saying the atmosphere is not for everyone. It's a small space where the tables are extremely close to one another it can be noisy. If you are willing to embrace the resulting conversations and meeting new people, then you also get the benefit of trying some of my favorite dishes and cocktails that the city of Charlotte has to offer.   Again, the space is small and they don't take reservations. Getting large crowds (4+) in is extremely difficult. While the no wait app has been a game changer, this place puts up ridiculous wait times so be prepared to go early. I also recommend trying one of the specialty cocktails here. Several big names in the Charlotte cocktail scene either started here or spent some time here. While I'm not sure who influenced who, I'll certainly enjoy the resulting drink menu they have to offer.   Regarding food, I've tried many dishes over the last few years and only have had a handful that didn't blow me away. I would treat this place as an experience more than a meal, and have easily spent close to 2 hours in the past ordering dishes (1) or (2) at a time and often putting my experience in the hands of our waiter/waitress as they are better versed in what is good for the night. Some highlights include the pork belly tacos, sashimi tuna tacos, and garlic truffle fries. Since the small plates can add up quick on my bill, I normally round out the night with a sushi roll as they tend to have more bang for your buck calorie to dollar wise.",

Grabbed some beers downstairs at Twenty- two in the meantime.   There seems to be only 3 booths that can fit bigger parties. They decided to take their sweet time with the bill, so we ordered some cucumber mule at the bar. I love it when mules are served in copper mugs which really brings out the refreshingness of the drink.   As usual, we did family style and shared: southern fried wings, truffle fries, Asian glazed pork belly tacos, sashimi tuna tacos, lamb lollipops, dirty south nachos, and special roll with coconut shrimp and tuna.   The pork belly tacos were out of this world!!! Every juicy bite was paired equally with a piece of pork belly and watermelon. The sweet and savory combo  was wonderful. The lamb lollipops were cooked to perfection as well. Everything else was pretty good as well, I'd pass on the dirty south nachos though.   TLDR: expect a long wait, get cucumber mule, Asian glazed pork belly tacos, and lamb lollipops.",

Don't dare ask them a question about the menu bc have no doubt you will get a look as to why the hell are you asking them \"they are only the bartenders\".  Let me give 5 stars the cooks bc they are the only ones who deserve it. The staff outside of that ZERO stars. I think the owners needs to do a complete 180 on training and remind the staff this is a job, they work for the restaurant and the cooks are one of the most important ppl there.  I will never return bc i will not drive 20mins out of my way for this type of service.  Promise you if this restaurant was in my neck of the woods they would not have lasted long!!",

    "text": "I want to start out by stating that I've actually been here a handful of times but it was before my time on ye ol' Yelp. This isn't some one night five star fling review ;) Soul consistently delivers when it comes to food and drink.  Soul is a cozy, hip restaurant that has an upstairs entrance. It also boasts a patio (that's heated during the winter months) which provides an abbreviated view of the skyline. They have a beautiful bar that's pretty much the centerpiece of the space. Ladies: there's an added bonus for bar seating. They have purse hooks!! As for restaurant seating? well...I'm not lying when I say it's cozy. There are about two-three booths and then rest of the seating consists of tables that can be grouped together or broken a part for two person seating. Trust me, you'll be so focused enjoying every bite of your food that you won't be worried about your proximity to your neighbor(s).  Back to the bar....the bartenders make THE BEST DRINKS. I've enjoyed their  summer version of the moscow mule which includes cucumber - yum - and their winter version called the winter's mule. The winter's mule is hands down my favorite drink and I was that person sucking down every last drop of the drink through her straw.  As for the food....there is so much to say. The place covers Asian, Greek, Spanish, American cuisines with such understated flair and sophistication. Clearly there's a reason why the pork belly tacos are so well-documented because THEY ARE DELICIOUS. Simply put, you absolutely must get those if/when you go there. It's like a rule. Every time I've been to Soul, I always get a sushi roll of some sort. They are very creative with the flavors and I'm always pleased.   Soul does not have a designated parking lot. Don't even bother thinking about parking in the CVS lot because they will either tow your car or yell at you when you walk back to your car (mentioning this from past experience). If you're lucky, grab a spot in the lot that's across Pizza Peel/The Dish and walk over or park in the Bistro La Bon/Healthy Home Market lot. Also, don't even think about not having to wait on a weekend night. If you're like me and don't enjoy waiting long periods of time for food (although this place is worth it), come on a Tuesday/Wednesday evening.  Being that the place serves tapas-style plates, be prepared to spend a little more $$$. It's by no means a cheap place (well...depending on your appetite) and it's worth every penny.",

There are only a few pescatarian friendly options but we had the hamachi and jalapeno special, babaganoush, salmon taco, shrimp skewer and a sushi roll (the only one that didn't have a fried component). The waiter said they have the best sushi, but of course they do because everything was fried!   The hamachi had good flavor but mine had a piece of bone in it.  The salmon tacos were small for the price and the fried wanton was too greasy (I like the idea but it wasn't as tasteful as I thought) The shrimp skewers were good but not spectacular. A bit too salty for my taste! The babaganoush was good but the pita chips were overbaked.  The food comes out quickly, yet there is still a 3-hour wait on weekends. I suggest meat eaters to come give this place a try but may not be so suitable for pescatarians!",

As in I felt like I was also on a date with the tables on either side of me. Thats seriously the only con from my experience last night. It's a great place to go for a special occasion because you can justify ordering half of the 10,000 things you want. Plus the tapas style of dining is perfect for conversation because you eat a little, then take a break.  We came for the pork belly tacos. This is a dish that actually lives up to the hype. I feel like so many of the \"must eat in charlotte\" things don't. The flavors were incredible. Really simple but the sauce on the pork belly and the watermelon were perfect compliments. I could have eaten 12 more.   Next were the dirty south nachos. I am personally not a fan of fried chicken skin I now know. The pimento cheese and pickled okra they were topped with were very good though.   Korean BBQ wings...amazing. Truffle fries. Our server described as like crack. He was right. I was full as could be still picking at them.  I ordered the sushi roll that was on special. It was really good, I just couldn't finish it, because, see above. Boyfriend got the ramen bowl. The sauce on the ramen was delicious.   Our server Marlon was great the entire meal! Very attentive without being annoying and made some excellent recommendations on the menu, for our table and others.   All in all, it was the perfect way to celebrate my birthday! I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "What a great find this place is Located in the hot trending Uptown area of Charlotte  The walk up the staircase to the second floor balcony reminded me of the French quarter in New Orleans. It was about 9:30 pm on a Tuesday and the place was packed! I liked the dimly lit and dark wood ambience. A well stocked bar, decent wine and sake list  We sat and dined at the bar. The menu is very gastro pub eclectic with things from sushi to a Korean take on wings to ramen with goat cheese balls to ahi tacos to pork belly with watermelon tacos.   The thing is everything is really good  It was now about 11 pm and the place was getting even busier and the music playing from the DJ was getting a little louder and better.   I kept thinking how much I was enjoying this place and the food and if I lived in Charlotte I would be here quite often  Time for another drink!",

    "text": "Soul is a funky, fun little gastropub located on the second floor of an old brick building on east Central Avenue. It features an eye-popping menu ranging from wings to skewers to sushi, all executed with a careful hand and quality ingredients. We visited on a Sunday evening after a Panthers game and it was fairly well packed including the outdoor patio space. I can say that the food here justifies any wait you may encounter.   Our selections included the grilled caesar, which comes out on a lightly charred leaf of romaine lettuce. This was quite flavorful with its seasoned croutons. The pork belly pita was served with some watermelon salsa and red onions and was quite delicious. Sushi items were masterfully prepared; we enjoyed our California roll and the lightly tempura fried tuna and salmon sakana roll. My one disappointment was the highly anticipated pork belly tacos. The presentation has three large cubes of pork belly glazed in a sweet Asian-inspired sauce topped with three cubes of watermelon. This is somewhat unwieldy to eat but unfortunately, my pork was slightly overdone so it wasn't my favorite item on the menu.  One shining highlight was our chocolate bread pudding dessert.  Rich but not overly sweet, our baked pudding was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and served with a large scoop of pistachio ice cream.  Service is exceptional here from the maitre d' to the wait staff and bus boys. I felt very welcome here. It's busy often from what I gathered from the staff and doesn't accept reservations, although I was able to put our party onto the waitlist through Yelp. We didn't have to stand very long to get seated once we arrived. If you're looking for an excellent meal that's a bit offbeat and eclectic, this is the place you've been looking for. Recommended.",

Ever tapa dish I had was absolutely delectable with unique flavors, garnishes, presentation. Most importantly all of the meats were cooked at the right temperature!  I would recommend everything I had  1. Fried Brussel Sprouts (lick the sauce off the plate good) 2. Pork Belly Tacos (I think I shed a tear because of how the flavors come together and melts in your mouth) 3. Roasted Duck w/ rice grits (Grits that will change your life) 4. Lamb Skewers (cooked perfectly and every bite was seasoned to perfection)  5. Smash and Grab Cocktail - refreshing drink with Bourbon and Basil   My only knock on the spot is the high price of the drinks/cocktails. After ordering a few rounds, I wasn't expecting a phone bill.   The wait can be a little long so get there early and get your reservations in.  I wild definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that comes to Charlotte.",

I went for someone's birthday. She had called and made reservations for a large party,  which they had confirmed with her. But when we all gathered at Soul, the host told us that they do not accept phone reservations and made us wait for an hour and a half. He was kind of rude about everything.  As far as food goes, I really think Soul needs to spend some quality time perfecting a menu. I appreciate the more creative items on the menu. The grilled romaine was beautifully presented. But overall a lot of the things we tried were just mediocre. I really think this is because the menu is so ambitious, and could really benefit from fine tuning.",

I understand the \"lounge\" title in the name now, but  I wasn't in the mood to converse with any one new that would have been seated inches on either side of me.  Charlotte peeps aren't into meeting strangers this way I find (I grew up in New Orleans where meeting new people while dining is the norm). We enjoyed sitting at the counter near the DJ.  Music was ok, but typical house music gets old quick. Variety is the spice of life - kinda like their menu.   The mixed dips where rather dull though (baba ganoush, humus, tziki) and were served with stale, I mean toasted, pita chips. Asked for warm pita which satisfied me and was worth the extra $1.  My wife had the steak skewer and she didn't likey.  We enjoyed their french fries very much. My highlight was their sushi. I loved the Soul Roll and their hamachi sashimi dish. Great presentation and fresh tasting. I'll try more sushi next time.  I'll be back but not in a huge, crazy, tremendous hurry.",

    "text": "My friends & I spent the evening out at Common Market South End when we realized none of us have eaten dinner yet! Being only a week into my relocation to Charlotte, my native friends took me out for a treat: Soul Gastrolounge.  It was about 10:30 at night, and the place was packed. We were originally told that the wait would be about 40 minutes. Ugh! About five minutes later, the hostess came back and explained that if we'd like to 'lounge,' the three of us could sit down right away. Sign us up! We were greeted by a selection of comfy chairs and a small coffee table. The setting was intimate, not too loud, and yet plenty of opportunities for people watching. I absolutely loved the eclectic decor, exposed brick, and dim lighting. With waters all around, we made our game plan by ordering four tapas: ahi tuna tacos, the dip trio, scallops, and fig arugula flatbread. Oh my lord. Not kidding when I say these were to die for! I think my favorite was the ahi tuna tacos; quite possibly the perfect mix of sushi meets mexican. The best taco shell I've ever had. Light, crunchy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I'd be happy to go into detail about all of the dishes we had, but I'm afraid we'd be here all night.  The service was great. Very accomodating. Our drinks were always filled, and she even brought us more pita chips (3 times, mind you!) for our dips. And at the end of the night, pricing wasn't too bad. Four tapas, three friends, $13 each + tip. Not too shabby. I'll definitely will be back. Great place to take friends, and this new Charlottean is hooked!",

We have been several times, and never been dissapointed. Consistency is sometimes tough for a restaurant, and I am happy to say that each meal has been wonderful.  The lamb lollipops....All I can say is, you will need more than one order. They are fabulous...maybe the best lamb I've ever had.

Hoisin Veal shortribs...excellent Bone marrow....very nice change from the usual! Cheese plate..good Sashimi tuna taco....excellent!!! Shrimp ceviche....excellent!!!  They also serve sparkling saki....which I had never had before. It is sweet saki and just delightful!   The decor and atmosphere are nice too...dark, but not too dark.

I'm a huge fan of the tapas style menu, and one of my favorite places no longer exists (Las Ramblas). Soul has great food. I loved the salmon o pita, saganaki (fried cheese), piquillo pepper bruschetta, and garlic french fries. The curried lamb skewers had awesome flavor, but were a tad bit dry. The marinated mushrooms weren't that memorable.  Our service was great. I tend to watch the wait/bar staff when I eat out, and I noticed they really get along and help each other out at Soul. I hope the owners appreciate them.  Comfortable atmosphere. I don't mind loud music as long as it's good. It was a pleasant experience, with great company :-)",

I stopped going for good reason; the service and food went rapidly downhill . Even the staff started to quit. I thought they had undergone new management because it seemed everything fell apart at the same time. The food went from fantastic to mediocre and the one accommodating staff, now sucks. In their defense, they still have a wide selection of tapas which is hit or miss depending on your taste. Also, Soul has a good feel to it  Exposed brick walls and comfy booths and couches.",

The hostess's are bitches and I am not a fan of them when I enter the door, but its worth a passing to sit there and eat their amazing food! I've had just about everything on their menu and I love how they have mini plates, so you can have a variety of food at once. Great place to bring a date, have a glass wine or even a cocktail, and hang out with friends. I probably go at least once a week, but the place is very small for such a fantastic food and drinks. Not recommended for huge parties because your food will take forever! I went the other night with 5 people and it took forever to sit, the hostess was a bitch to us because we had 5 people, and our food came out in spurts so we never got to eat all at the same time. One recommendation for Soul is get better hostess's and make your place bigger for dining. Your food is way to good not too! I gave you 4 stars because of my past experience with having a bigger group and the fact that every time I go in their your hostess's are rude, bitchy, and straight up not friendly.",

My first impression was \"Ok I'm here.... where is it?\"  Well Its upstairs, above a skate shop / bar.  Walking up the stairs your first greeted with a metal catwalk type of area with outdoor seating, so of course this is where I sat.  Looking inside,  the Lounge looked very hip and trendy.  What I really like about it was the fact that music was not blasting, and you'd actually be able to have a conversation.  Food:  Rocks.  I had a sushi roll, can't recall the name, but it was great and huge.  The nigiri and sashimi I had were by FAR the largest I've ever had and best tasting.  As a big fan of eal I of course had that, simply amazing.  Two pieces was the size of a typical sushi roll somewhere else.  Had a few other dishes and they were all delish, hands down try this place!",

Love that this place opened in the neighborhood, but based on my experience, I will only go for drinks from now on.   Yes - it is very cool inside, and love the balcony looking over the city.  The menu looks great on paper but the execution and service needs to have some kinks worked out.  Hoping it is just the newness factor.   The staff kept bringing us the wrong table's food.  Most times we knew it - except the one time.... We ordered \"spicy tuna\" rolls - It looked like a mess when it came out (like I would have rolled it.) but had some avocado and extras in it.... After my date and I finished it, the waiter brought out the \"spicy tuna rolls\" and we realized we just finished the people next to us rolls.  The other stuff we ordered (grilled cheese panini, fries) tasted good - but how could you screw that up?  You can tell that the waitress was working hard and was still friendly to us, but it just seems like there was some execution issues going on.  Hope they get things worked out.",

The ambiance is groovy in a refreshingly alternative way and could easily be at home in San Francisco. The music is usually really good, but can be a bit loud at times making conversation difficult. Still, a respectable first funky date location if I do say so myself.  On to the food, there are a few must haves: the truffle fries and the pork belly tacos. The fries go without saying on account of the truffle, while the pork belly tacos consist of simple ingredients that I would never expect to have worked together: tortilla, 3 cubes of fatty pork belly, an Asian glaze, and watermelon. Yes, watermelon. At $9 for two small tacos I could rightfully call it highway robbery. But you'll be paying for seconds and thirds (as I have been known to do) when these flavors combine to elicit tears of ecstasy as you fall to your quivering knees in a euphoric culinary-induced coma. I may have to clear my schedule tonight.  Honestly, I've never really had anything bad here--although I can say that the bone marrow challenged me a little. All aside, there is a reason that there is often 2 hour+ waits to get inside for dinner. They are amazing.   TIP: If there is a huge line, try stalking the patrons in bar stools until you can swoop in. I reduced my 2 hour wait to 5 minutes this way.",

Perfect and pretty sure its made in house?   Soul Roll: The spicy mayo and jalepeno give it a nice kick and salmon is bangin.   LAMB LOLLIPOPS: If you don't get these, you're a fool. (Unless you're a veg) Perfectly cooked, french cut (lollipop style) and served with amazing pecorino. Worth the cash you'll have to drop. Every time.   Cheese Plate: Good for sharing. Nice assortment. Manchego is fantastic.   FRIED CHEESE: Not sure if this is always on the menu, but if it is you'll be hard pressed to stop eating it hand over fist. Amazing.   Paninis: Mini Burgers, Mushrooms on toast and the Cubanini are my favs. Definitely a good go-to if you're in a pinch.   Dip Trio: tzatziki, hummus, babaganoush  are all great and interesting.   The only cons I can think of is getting a seat. Put your name in, head down to 22 for a beer and chill if it's a nice night. You can always try and squeeze in at the bar. Definitely get the same experience and can sometimes be faster on a busy night.   Love Soul. Places like this make Charlotte more unique. The dining experience is different every time and there always seems to be something new to try. Culinarily daring, busy as all get out and worth every penny.",

We were scared to say anything to him because he was yelling at his friends and large wads of cash were being exchanged. We did not feel safe during our meal. We read it was on the top 50 charlotte restaurants. It should not have even made the list.",

I would suggest downloading no wait so that you can show up when your table is ready, only downfall is always a long wait but worth it, especially when using the no wait app.",

    "text": "I really really wanted to fall in love with this place, maybe my expectations were too high. Everyone I spoke to raved about this place and Yelp gives it great reviews, but if I'm being completely honest, Soul you left me a tad disappointed. We will start with the bad and end with the good.  No reservations- always upsets me, really? why not? The hostess didn't offer to sit up outside ( I wasn't aware we could actually sit outside until I saw a few people grab a table)  We ordered 4 tapas. The eggplant parm skewers were 2/5. They tasted like over breaded, burnt to a crisp mozzarella sticks. Not a great way to start off our dinner. The  pork belly tacos 3/5- they fell short, the pork was very dry and chewy, not a huge fan.  The dumpster downstairs was overflowing with trash and even when I tried not to focus on the awful smell it would creep up and smack you in the face ( Not really sure if it was Soul's dumpster... It could just be bad luck. I thought some of the pricing seemed  pretty high for what you were getting. there is absolutely no way pork belly tacos (2) should be 12 dollars.   Moving on to the good... The waitress was friendly, quick and overall a good and nice waitress ( extra extra brownie points for trying to hard to light the birthday candle)  The dancing tuna roll was awesome- 5/5 stars AMAZING  The Goat cheese flat bread was rich, warm and with a perfect flaky crust... YUM 4/5  The chocolate chocolate  cupcake was quite delish, not the best I have ever had, but not bad at all.  The view was so pretty and with the warm August breeze we never waned to leave. Soul, I will give you another shot and change up my ordering.  Thank you for a different dinning experience even if a few options fell short of expectations.",

From the food, drinks, ambient music, and staff, it truly is an experience from start to finish. When I first moved to plaza midwood, my roommate and I came here to celebrate. I was in love with the seasonal mules, and other unique cocktails. It's a rite of passage to get the pork belly tacos, but there are so many other delicious options! The dirty south nachos sound odd (especially to a northerner like me), but they are just too good to pass up. It bothers some people that they don't take reservations, but as with any special or luxury experience, they don't offer them because they don't have to. They know the value of their venue and truthfully, I don't mind sitting at the bar for 2 hours prior to my meal and loading up on cocktails. Go, as fast as you can.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner with two friends because I saw decent reviews. It's location is in a pretty hipsterish area in Charlotte--but not the NoDa kind of hipster lol. I called for a reservation and they said they didn't take reservations so we just went but when we got there we had to have the entire party for them to seat us--understandable. I honestly wanted to sit inside but they said they don't seat parties of 3's in booths and that there was a party of 10 taking up all of the  3-seaters. I asked if we could sit at the perfectly open seats in the back but the host said those are strictly for two people, even though ten seats were literally wide open...didn't really understand their logic but just went with it. The host was kind of rude though to be honest, in a passive way.  When we were finally seated we actually sat outside, but it was a nice view and the weather was nice so we didn't mind. We ordered two orders of pork belly tacos with watermelon salsa, the surf and turf special, and curried lamb at first. It took a good 20-ish minute wait for our food to come out, and I was a bit surprised actually at the portion sizes. They were so small. Especially for the price ($12~$18 range). There were only two pork belly tacos on a plate, so essentially we were paying $6 per taco. I won't complain about the taste though--it was delectable! But because the portions were so small, we ended up ordering southern style and Korean style wings as well, and to no surprise, there were only like 5-6 wings. The wings weren't anything special, and the Korean style wings were too burnt because they used gochujang (red pepper paste), which burns easily. To wrap up, we ordered two cocktails which were crazily overpriced..they were seriously the same price as the food (at least $12). I don't think I'd go drinking there again.  Overall, the atmosphere and food is great, but they could step up their game with service and pricing and/or portion sizes. I might go there on a pay day or something if I want to be a bit more fancy, but I don't find myself coming here often.",

The only disappointing part was there was a slight taste of something else (maybe fishy). Perhaps it was time to change the oil that they finish the pork belly in. The fish on the Soul Roll was fantastic but the roll could have used some more flavor. The Dirty South nachos were over the top indulgent and I loved them. I could feel my arteries tighten LOL.

Everything is served tapas style and we ordered 5 items in total which was enough for my wife and I. Cocktails were great and the food was very good. Some highlights were the Southern Fried Chicken Wings, Truffle Fries, Sushi, and Mushroom Sandwich. Will definitely go back, but the service was lacking. The waitress made several mistakes on our order and was not very attentive as we waited 10+ minutes before we ever even greeted. Perhaps this was due to us sitting outside, though we were seated by a hostess... The food comes out as it is finished and there were multiple servers that ultimately helped us out which helped the overall experience. Even though the service was lacking, the food more than compensated. If you are in Plaza Midwood, I would encourage you to stop in. Not exactly cheap, but worth it.

My companion and I finally got seats here at the counter - they don't take reservations, and they don't need to; it's so crowded always. We actually went to Workman's Friend for a few drinks while we waited. Luckily they will text (or was it call?) you when it's your turn. We were so excited to try some dishes. My dinner date and I have completely different tastes in foods, but we got a few different items to share.  Portion size was good, and we got the food very quickly, but EVERY single dish was so insanely salty we had difficulty eating it.   Korean BBQ Wings - Way over with the sauce. Way. Gochujang goes a long way, and this was just too much. It could have been diluted at least 2x. Not every millimeter of the wing needs to be coated in sauce. This made me sad. We were actually pulling the outer layer off so we could at least eat the non-coated chicken underneath.  Saganaki - Again, too salty. It was delicious, because how can you really go wrong with partially melted cheese that's been lit on fire? Even the little bits of toast that came with the cheese was pre-salted. Salt on top of salt on top of salt. If we didn't have heart or kidney issues before, I think we do now.   Dynamite Roll (I think!) - The flavors melded pretty nicely in this sushi roll, and the presentation was excellent. There was just one thing wrong. Take a guess. Yep, too much salt. It had a sauce drizzled on top of it and underneath, which, while had a great flavor, was too salty!  Wild Mushrooms on Toast - Toast, mushrooms, and a fried egg. How can you go wrong? You go wrong if there's too much salt. The toast was buttered or oiled with salt, the mushrooms were much too salty and oily, and the fried egg was of course salted.  As I stated, my companion and I have very different tastes in foods and neither of us enjoyed any of these dishes. The flavor underneath the salt was promising, and the presentation was all very nice. From what I could tell, it was a normal night. There were no neighboring complaints about food - just happy people stuffing their faces. I'm sorry we were not able to join in the enthusiasm.",

Small menu of bar food with some great selections (couple sushi selections, skewers of assorted meats/fish) - and some not so healthy options (various fried foods). Thought the skewers were an especially great option for small bites while enjoying the great drinks. A note of personal thanks to the staff for safe keeping my credit card that I accidentally left behind - was relieved to retrieve it there the next day!",

    "text": "My sister in law suggested this place while I was in Charlotte for work. This was one of the few bars open during the week day during late  hours (points for that). When you walk up the outside stair way, the business offers seating on the balcony and I believe I saw heaters outside as well - for the patrons that choose to sit outside on the cold nights. My sister and I were freezing so we opted to sit inside. The seating in here seems a little limited to me but my sister in law says they often draw large crowds at this establishment. After we took our seat, our waitress came over to welcome us and take our drink order. I wasn't too impressed by the speciality drink selection options but ended up trying the The Golden King (this one has rum in it). When the drink came back my taste buds could not tell me if I actually liked the drink or if I didn't like the drink. I think I liked the drink because I finished it or maybe due to the price I finished it. To me the Golden King is stronger drink, so I don't suggest it if you are looking for something sweet. Next my sister ordered a white dip. This came with pita chips. The dip was cream cheese tasting dip, something i never had before and tasted ok. Finally I opted to order some sushi. Now this was really good! I can't remember the name of the roll but I took a picture. After I ate dinner I really wanted a cupcake but the only make one flavor of the day. The day I came it was chocolate which I am not a fan of, so no cupcake for me. I do give this place props for the decoration, late hours, and sushi!",

The goat cheese on bruschetta (my friend ordered) was great as well. We sat outside with a beautiful view of the Charlotte skyline which was gorgeous. Topped it all off with the Vietnamese coffee ice cream which was pretty tasty. Wonderful service as well and deserving to be in the top 25 restaurants in Charlotte.",

Nothing was bad, and several of the dished were Truely outstanding.  We did five small plate/tapas and had a comfortable amount of food for two.  The top item we had was a shrimp cheviche made with coconut milk. It was sweet, of all things, with a touch of heat and was remarkable in a very good way.  The Salmon-O-Pitas were also wponderful (though I would have liked more a of a salmon flavor).  Likewise the goat cheese flatbreads. Definietly worth a return visit -- if only we could.",

It's got a hip cool vibe and service in general is good. I've been a couple of times and every time love love love their ramen bowl. It certainly is NOT traditional ramen but kind of an american/italian fusion on ramen with a cheese based sauce rather than the typical pork broth. The noodles are always cooked well and the overall dish is bursting with flavor. Most people like the pork belly tacos which is good but I definitely wasn't wowed like most people. Have tried a variety of other things such as their brussel sprouts, mac and cheese, mussels, and bone marrow. Everything was good but again, it's the ramen bowl that keeps me coming back.",

Also ordered the spanokopitia which was disappointing.   The phyllo was dry and not buttery and there was a scant amount of feta to balance the spinach.   The linguini special was very good as was the grilled ceaser salad.   The sushi looked amazing and some of the other small plates looked worthy of a second try.

I had a special salmon ramen with cream cheese sauce that was probably the most filling item on the menu. My roommate had a burger that he raved about and this guy eats more burgers than anyone else I've ever seen. A couple friends liked the sushi, although I'm sure there are better places for sushi.  Beers and drinks weren't as great. Most of it was served by the can, which was shocking considering Soul looks pretty fancy.  The booths are large and tall so you don't really even see other people.

The cocktail menu changes seasonally and never seizes to amaze me! One thing that's a must for me is consistency and they have it with their service,food, and the cocktails doesn't matter who prepares it!",

    "text": "While in Charlotte for the week, I was given multiple recommendations to come to Soul, but was warned repeatedly about the crowds and long wait times. Being by myself, I was hoping to sneak in to a bar seat and after about 30 minutes of creeping behind some folks I did snag a seat. So... I didn't have to experience the foretold wait times. That being said, after my experience I would have waited multiple hours to experience the amazing food and cocktails that Soul offer up.   The people were amazing. Amanda, Kelly, Johnny(?), and Josh(? - sorry, I drank a couple too many cocktails and some names are fuzzy, but EVERYONE from the host stand to the DJ were impeccable). Their suggestions were spot on and they truly know mixology. I didn't have a sip I didn't enjoy and found a few of the libations completely unique. Toward the end of my evening they every suggested that I try to make the Punch Room before it closed for the night because they said that there I could find the pinnacle of cocktails. But I just couldn't leave the amazing experience I was having here.   As far as cocktails go, I will let you go there and have the staff explain them, because I'm not sure I could do that justice. They have some cocktails on tap which I was skeptical of but the one I tried was spot on. They had a drink, Black Lace,  with activated charcoal and porcini mushrooms - sounds weird? Yes. Was it my favorite drink of the night? Absolutely. The point is, I wouldn't come here and suggest drinking beer. These bartenders are on point and will guide you through the process to suit your tastes. Amazing!!  Lastly, the food. I ordered one thing at a time so my meal might seem to have been disjointed. But I enjoyed every bite. I started with Serrano and Manchego on Toast points. This is my all time favorite combo originating from Spain. I wish it had been served traditionally on a crusty bread BUT it was amazingly fresh and super generous. I then went to the dirty south nachos which were quite indulgent. These stuck out as the outliers. They didn't flow with anything else I ate but I would order them again. Then there was the cheese plate which was super generous as well, followed by the Duck Bahn Fit. This sandwich was so stupid good I wanted another immediately. But I had to try the sushi. This was the highlight of the night. I was convinced to go with sashimi. Whoever is cutting this fish is insanely talented. Non- traditional cuts but perfect to highlight each selection. At this point, these folks knew I was here to EAT so the chef sent me an amazing special soy sauce to accompany my last course (Many MANY thanks for this - truly unique). I basically rolled myself out in to the uber, but it was worth the slight discomfort. Thank you to everyone who made my night remarkable. I can't wait to come back",

No reservations so you have to be prepared to have some lovely drinks while you wait.   Food: some awesome dishes. Especially love the coconut shrimp ceviche, which is super tasty. The hamachi roll melts in the mouth. The roasted Brussels sprouts have really rich flavor. And best of all, the pork belly tacos with watermelon. These are just incredibly delicious.

She knows how profound my desire for craft cocktails runs, so this was our first stop for the evening.  It did not disappoint.    First off I love the comfy darkness of this place.  Reminds me of stepping into a speakeasy where you kick your shitty sunny ass day off at the door and melt into a bar stool or cozy chair and sip into a blissful state of relaxation.  I loved the exposed brick, the well thought out lighting and the art.   The bartender that evening was courteous and prompt.  She answered all of our questions without hesitation or any notable sense of annoyance.  She whipped us up some fabulous drinks as well.  We ordered the Flip'n Branca and Flamed Martin off the spring 15 cocktail menu.  Both so scrumptious!!    Though this review is only for a two drink experience - the food coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and I'd certainly give this place a go again!",

The atmosphere is great, comfy, and as another reviewer, the music is incredible; it makes you take notice!  Our server was great and well informed.  It always helps when the waiter has personally tasted the dishes being served.  Since we could not possibly experience everything on the menu, we had:  - grilled caesar salad: 4/5 - white bean/goat cheese dip:  4/5 (served cold but it grows on you) - Korean BBQ wings (not spicy at all, more sweet):  5/5 - salted caramel-popcorn buttercream cupcake:  4/5 - Punto Final Malbec (Argentina):  5/5  We ordered the sashimi tuna tacos as well, but they never made it to the table...next visit but I really didn't mind.  Soul has a small but adequate wine listing and the couple we ordered were delightful.  This is a hip but inviting spot to hang out for something to eat and drink in the Plaza-Midwood area and I always enjoy great spots that my fellow reviewers love!  Best regards...",

Additionally, the cheapest wine bottles run in the 30's. With that being said, I am not complaining. Just be aware that you're not going to be filled up after 1 plate. Its best to go with a group of 3-4 so you can order more dishes and try out a lot! The atmosphere is awesome! Just make sure to get here early because the wait will be long. We got the cabernet and it was great! Here is a break down of the food....  Dirty South Nachos- 5/5 Chicken skins fried and topped with melted pimento cheese. I have always been a fan of the skin of the chicken and this was heavenly for someone who loves fried food... just not very healthy   Sashimi Tuna Tacos- 5/5 They were perfect especially the sriracha mayo  Flatbread 3/5- It was average to us  Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos- 5/5 They don't look like what you expect tacos to look like but they are really tasty. The watermelon is a unique twist  Sticky Veal Short Ribs-4/5 Solid choice!  Pan Con Tomate- 5/5- Recommended by our waitress and the ultimate favorite of the table  Spanakopita- 4/5 Good but you don't get as much as you expect and it can't beat traditional Greek made   Bone Marrow- 2/5 We were being adventurous and probably just don't like bone marrow. I won't hold it against them.  The service was EXCELLENT!",

This is going to be short because I have absolutely no complaints I'm going to sum it all up by saying great food , great drinks, great people, great vibes. Never have I went to Soul Gastrolounge in years of coming here have I had anything I didn't like and in my opinion hands down they have some of the best mixed drinks and best bartenders Charlotte has to offer. Do yourself a favor and make this a must go to stop! Thank me later.",

    "text": "Soul Gastrolounge!  This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I've had my last two birthday dinners and countless other dinners here and I love the atmosphere and how diverse and eclectic the menu is. Greek-inspired, Middle Eastern, sushi, southern, there is something for everyone, for the most adventurous palates (Rocky Mountain Oysters) to not so adventurous palates (Soul Grilled Cheese). Since I've tried a variety of tapas here, I'll break them down into my top choices, ones worth trying, and ones that are just not good.  MY FAVORITES +Piquillo Peppers on Bruschetta: These taste like mini pizzas! A little difficult to eat but I love the flavors here. I usually get 2 orders and if I have to share, I'll get an additional order. The tomatoes are marinated well and the bread is super crispy. I'll get these EVERY SINGLE TIME. +Godzilla Roll: Not a sushi fan, but this is the best sushi of my life. I don't like the regular sauces it comes with (mayo, eel sauce, & sweet and sour) so I get this with sweet chili sauce instead! A little heavy on the cream cheese but still so so good. +Falafel Pita: I don't like tomatoes in this so I ask them to put tiny pickles instead. Extra tzatziki doesn't hurt either! +Truffle Fries: Hot, crispy, flavored with garlic, truffle oil, and pecorino cheese. Basically amazing. +Banana Phyllo Turnovers: A sweet way to end a delicious meal. I might ask for more ice cream next time.  WORTH TRYING +Fried Goat Cheese on Bruschetta: One of my friend's favorites! I prefer the Piquillo Peppers though, cause these are a bit blander than the peppers. Easier to eat though. +Flatbread: With pistachio pesto, truffle whipped goat cheese, honey-braised garlic, and arugula. A little sticky and messy and although I dislike arugula, somehow this combination works. Not something I'd order every time though. +Sashimi Tuna Tacos: While I'm not a fan of most of the components in this (sashimi, tuna, & mayo), every time we're here, this is a must-get item for LA. +Fried Brussels Sprouts: Smells horrible but tastes pretty good. Vegetarians, they cannot leave the bacon off of this. +Daily Specials: Most of the time the daily specials are not vegetarian-friendly so I usually stay away from them. A few months ago, they actually had a vegan special that I tried. It was Linguine with Chanterelle Mushroom & Porcini Cream with Sliced Honey Truffles. Kinda bland but I took it home and after I added a little Sriracha to it.. A++. +Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding: So I didn't actually order this, it was a little surprise they brought out for my birthday last year and it was really good! Tasted like a delicious, warm brownie.  SKIP! +Ahi Tuna Skewers: Ok this goes back to my disdain for tuna in general but I wanted to try something different one time and I did not like this at all. I asked for the tuna to be cooked really well done but apparently it was a request they could not do and the tuna was still red in the middle when I got it. Had they cooked it to my liking, this could have ended up in the \"worth trying\" list. +Anchovy Fries: Nothing special about these.. Breading has no flavor and I don't like the sauce it comes with. +Grilled Caesar: I found the concept to be intriguing but the execution wasn't there for me. It was difficult to eat and there was an extremely heavy anchovy flavor in the dressing. +Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos: Seriously this is their best seller?! LA and I found it to be all hype. The pork belly and the watermelon were ok separately I guess but together? YUCK. I hated the texture and flavor of everything together. The soggy flour tortilla was useless too. I know I'm in the minority here but if it's not good, I'm not going to lie and say that it is.  OTHER TAPAS I'VE TRIED (1-5 star rating) Eggplant Parmesan Skewers (****) Babaganoush (****) Spicy Feta Dip (***) Chimichurri Beef Skewers (***) Soul Grilled Cheese (***) Spanakopita (***) Dirty South Nachos (***)  MY TO TRY LIST (for the future) Salmon-o-pita, Saganaki, Ki Roll (vegan sushi!), Hamachi with Jalapeno, Eel Roll, Guacamole Stack, Country Greek Salad, Midwood Mixed Greens, Taramosalata, Marinated Spanish White Anchovies on Bruschetta, Cupcake of the Day  The seasonal cocktails are interesting and worth trying. Some of them are like wtf (in size and/or taste) but others can be really good. Servers are friendly and it's nice that some of them remember me even if several months go by in between my visits.  Yes there might be a long wait. This place is tiny and popular. I usually get here after peak times so I've never waited more than 30-45 minutes. Just download the Nowait app. If I have to wait, I'll just walk over to the Common Market (about 5 min walk) and grab a beer or a small snack. Pay attention to your phone though! I think they hold your table for 5-10 minutes once they send you a text that it's ready.  Thanks to anyone who read my novel.  Looking forward to my next visit to Soul!!",

The patio is very nice and somewhat secluded while the inside has more of a pub feel with live music on some nights. The menu here is a diverse array of small plates with lots of things to please everyone. My favorites are the sushi and the sliders. This place is a nice staple to the plaza midwood area and should be a priority for anyone in Charlotte!",

    "text": "Soul Gastrolounge now has emotional value to me. It's about to get really sappy, sorry in advance.   My boyfriend and I went to Soul Gastrolounge on our first real date, March of 2016. Everything was SEAMLESS. Everything WORKED. Our service was great, server was very attentive and knowledgeable. The ambience was cool and casual, the lighting was perfect. The music and the style was trendy but not super stuck up. The perfect environment for any date night.   Now the food, the most important part of any restaurant review on Yelp. To put it into perspective, this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and one of my fave in the US, period. My personal fave are the sashimi tuna tacos and the ceviche. Sooooo yummy! I've tried a bunch of other things on the menu and there has not been one single thing I haven't liked. It's Tapas style and there's something on the menu for every taste I think. Drinks: they're strong, so be careful. I couldn't handle more than 2, these bartenders are generous with the alcohol.   Also, my bf went to eat here alone on his birthday once while I was unfortunately out of town for work. I called the restaurant and asked if they'd let me buy him a drink and dessert and they cooperated in helping me surprise him and let me pay with my card. Pulled it off perfectly. Almost 2 years later we are now a happy couple and Soul Gastrolounge still provides the perfect setting for date night and still delivers on the great food and service. Thank you Soul for orchestrating the perfect first evening for us. This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and one of my fave in the U.S. An absolute MUST HAVE while in Queen City.",

    "text": "Hipster vibes with classy eats  Plaza Midwood is kicking and Soul Gastrolounge is no exception. Soul is located on the second level, so don't try to go to the front door. With the doors opening at 5pm and them not taking reservations I suggest arriving early if you want to eat at a decent time. Soul is also on the app \"Nowait\", where you can put your name on the list only if there is a wait.   Arriving at 6:30pm on a Friday night it was almost an hour wait if we wanted to eat inside. We sat on the enclosed balcony. This area also has heat lamps and overlooks the skyline, not a bad deal. I wanted to sit inside because it was our first time at Soul, but waiting over an hour was not going to fly.   Libations A lot of their specialty drinks are on tap which I found interesting. The Feeling Squirrley was an awesome beverage, but I don't think it was worth $13.  Cucumber Mule was light refreshing and had just the kick it needed.   Grubs Keep in mind these are tapas //small plates. You should share with folks, but when you have a veggie and a meat eater together it's a little hard. We opted to share a sushi and then get our own small plate. The portions are decently sized for being tapas. +Dirty South Nachos, the pickled okra was the best part of these. Felt a little overdone and trying too hard for Soul. +Flatbread- this is the reason I would bring someone to Soul. This flatbread had my taste buds jumping for joy.  +Dancing Tuna Roll- Seared tuna with avocado are what dreams are made of. This roll made up for the wait, the drinks and the chicken skin nachos. I can't even tell you about it because you'll just have to try it yourself.   Try to make it to Soul in the Summer right before sunset.",

    "text": "Soul Gastrolounge can get really busy - so expect to wait outside or on the stairs for a table.  Because of the exciting choices on the menu, I was pumped to try out this place.  Armed with a Corporate card and a coworker, we arrived at Soul on a Wednesday evening and hardly had to wait.  We both got a table outside, which was actually really nice on an early fall evening.  Service was great - our server was very nice and our plates were cleared quickly and waters always full.    For food, we ordered the following:  Asian Glazed Pork Belly Tacos - ain't nothin' \"Asian-glazed\" about these tacos... unless something like five spice qualifies as \"Asian\".  However, these were my favorite out of the bunch we ordered.  The pork belly was nicely cooked, really flavorful with the \"Asian Glaze\" and the watermelon salsa (really just marinated watermelon) added a nice flavor to the bite as a whole.  I would probably rather have this without the tortilla.  Ramen bowl - very large serving!  The first 5 bites of this was really good, but then it just really became way too salty.  The ramen noodles were nice and chewy and reminded me of the kind that comes in American instant ramen (Top Ramen).  What really stood out here were the veal cheeks that basically melted in your mouth and the amazing goat cheese fried mushrooms.  YUM.  Bone marrow - pass.  This hardly tasted like anything and was basically a ton of butter on some crostini.  Flatbread - truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto, honey braised garlic and fresh arugula - actually quite tasty, but hard to eat.  It was very soggy, but had really good flavor from the mix of ingredients.  Korean BBQ wings - I live in NYC... where Korean chicken wings are a real thing and really delicious.... unfortunately these do not compare.  Chicken wings need to be more crispy, in my opinion.  For dessert, we got the banana chocolate phyllo turnovers - such a good decision and at $5, it was very reasonably priced.  However the star of this show was the banana pudding ice cream - SO GOOD.  Too bad they don't sell it by itself.  I'm not really sure what to call this place... like an American/Asian \"fusion\" or what, but it's a decent place for drinks and tapas with a good environment.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to food, only because I've had far better in NYC.  Bottom line - decent food, great atmosphere.",

    "text": "What a first time experience for me! My girlfriend and another friend in our group had already been able to live the Soul Gastrolounge experience, and they had nothing but good things to say! I was ready.  Ironically, my girlfriend had asked if I had been there before as we passed by heading to nearby Resident Culture Taproom. After a few hours and a few cold ones there, it was time to get the grub on... What came up among a couple other options? You guessed it. Soul!  Parking is a bit rough around the Midwood area, but we managed to squeeze the ol pickup truck in a spot at a nearby closed business. There was a bit of a wait, unless we wanted to sit outside in the covered area with supposed warmers. We chose to wait a few minutes, which turned out to be not that bad at all while they cleaned the awaiting booth for our group. We started with our drink orders. It took quite some time for the waitress to return to start our food order and in that time frame, they ran out of the sushi roll of the day special. That was frustrating since we waited to see her comeback so we could order one. Anyway, we ended up going with a Soul original roll. That was very tasty. We then moved on to the following tapas:  - ASIAN GLAZED PORK BELLY TACOS: First off let me say, I was excited about this because I am not a fan of pork belly .. or should I say, WASN'T a fan of pork belly until the SG version of pork belly entered my life. Combine that with the slight bite from the watermelon salsa chunk... makes you say OOOOWEEE.. like a pig.  - SHELLS & CHEESE: These were \"ok..\" Very cheesy, indeed. Filled with shredded style pork belly meat.  - FRIED MEATBALLS: Very tasty, especially combined with the yummy tzatziki!  - MINI BURGERS: Wow! Very delicious! Comes with three, we added a 4th (with an upcharge) since we had four people.  The fancy creative drinks are just that: fancy .. and pricey! But, you'll have that at a place that specializes in creative cocktails and liquor ON TAP! When you're in the need for the \"facilities\" there are two gender neutral lavatories near the rear of the establishment.  Everything we had was just fantastic and tasted great! We will definitely be back to visit in the near future!",

A few of my favorites include the Parmesan truffle friend, flatbread, sushimi tuna tacos and the red dragon roll. My husband loves the pork belly tacos and the dirty south nachos.

I had the salmon-o-pita which unfortunately is mostly cream cheese and not salmon. The shells and cheese was my favorite, but watch out, it is very heavy! The bone marrow was excellent and very well done. Just understand it is a lot of bone marrow (three large bones to be exact). The Red Dragon roll is excellent and has some extra tuna in the middle of the plate. The only downside is that the restaraunt is quite loud so just expect to talk a little louder. There is not much parking either so it may take a while to find some. I thought it was a great night and I would come here again.",

I didn't take many pictures, but the food is exotic and good. The lamb was nice and tender loved the sliders they had a spicy sauce on them and the spiced drink I had really warmed me up. The lemon ice cub gave it a zing. The staff were attentive and friendly. I suggest making a reservation in advance or you may be left standing. There was a large crowd that accumulated as we dinned. The food came out quick when you order despite the crowd. Overall I recommend and will return to try more of there tapas.",

Just to start, after twenty minutes of no service and sweating outside we asked if we could move inside and were told no, that we would have to wait an additional 45 minutes to our previous hour wait. Funny, approximately five minutes later the table of servers from the restaurant were eating at a table nearby and were told \"hey guys it's hot out here would you like to move to a booth inside?\"  The reason we had come to this restaurant in the first place was to give it a second chance, after a friend kindly gave us a gift card for my fiance's birthday (which was the same day). They proceeded to tell me we were unable to honor the gift card due to being processed the same day.  The Sushi was fine and probably the silver lining of the night, however, shells, skewers were not good.   Overall I would not wish this experience on anyone.  Worst birthday dinner in history. I am embarrassed we gave it a second chance.  Take your business elsewhere. So much potential yet such a disappointment.    Overall, I hate to give a bad review because I love the Plaza Midwood area. It has so much character and wonderful places. Unfortunately, Soul has consistently been a miserable experience.",

So far I've tried other items as well and I have to say I have not found anything I do not thoroughly enjoy.

The size of the space makes it feel cozy- both perfect for a date night or an evening with friends the small plates make for wonderful sharing experience.   The Greek salad is the best I have ever had. No lettuce but stuffed with marinated veggies and a healthy block of feta right on top. The pork belly tacos are an absolute staple - big chunks of pork belly with a square of juicy watermelon creates an amazing flavor combination. We also tried the shells and cheese. Wow. Again the flavors were insane...goey melted cheese with a crispy top layer over three shells stuffed with BBQ pork belly. The last thing that really sticks out were the fried goat cheese on bruschetta - an amazing ball of fried goat cheese on top of perfectly seasoned bruschetta and a crispy baguette.   Even on a Monday this place was packed so make sure to do the Yelp check in feature to lock down a table.",

There is a bit of a wait during their peak hours which could be a little discouraging if you are looking to sit quickly somewhere.  Although, it may be worth it to hang around a wait for  the bar or outside seating when the weather is nice. I had the sushi which was pretty good, most say its hard to mess up sushi but I disagree. The chicken wings are also a great bite. Their menu options are a tad different than your normal restaurants but who said you cant try something new. The service was pretty decent and the music sets off the nice vibe I was speaking of.   Overall, the experience was enjoyable. During our wait the floor manager made sure that we were taken care of from beginning to end. I would recommend them if you're looking for something relaxed with a good ambiance.",

I had the gyro which was lamb and beef mixed on a stick. It came with three pieces and yogurt. It smelled like faint poop and didn't taste well seasoned. Just not a great thing. I also had Brussel's sprouts. They were well seasoned and cooked correctly. The birthday girl had an orange cupcake that we all tasted. No one like the cupcake. Lastly, our server kind of rushed us throughout the entire dinner. Middle of the road friendly. It just wasn't a great experience. I will say that the Korean BBQ wings were good and that's what I would recommend to anyone visiting.",

    "text": "When my friends told me about this place in Charlotte that had a large variety of food and they started listing out the food, I thought they were just pulling my leg. Literally they were talking about tacos, wings, sushi, ramen, mac and cheese, paninis, and the list goes on. When I heard of all the choices, I thought it must be one of those spots that don't do anything really well so they just go for pure diversity so while I was apprehensive about heading to this joint as my last meal for my final work trip to Charlotte, I decided to be open minded and give it a shot. This joint is located in an area which has apparently gone through a lot of modifications/upgrades over the recent years according to my friend. The spot itself is up a flight of stairs and there are some patio seats outside and the moment you step inside, you see a bar along with a few booths and tables around.   The spot has a policy of only seating tables when your entire party has arrived so something to keep in mind if you are going with a large group. We were seated quickly given our group was present and we were given menus quickly after. Sure enough this place has a ton of options and while we had a tough time narrowing it down, we went with Asian Glazed pork belly tacos, lamb lollipops, Dirty South Nachos, Shells and Cheese, Korean Chicken Wings, the Cuban panini, and the Red Dragon Roll. We also ordered off the drink menu as the bar had an extensive menu so should be a lot of options for any type of drinker. The Asian Glazed pork belly tacos were out first and they were good. The pork belly was tender and while the watermelon chunks were a bit big, it actually was not overwhelming. A solid fusion starter for sure. The Dirty south Nachos were out next and these were really good although the presentation of it was quite interesting. The pimento cheese fondue was good but it wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for and ended up being just a bit too much cheese for me. The lamb lollipops were by far my least favorite and I would recommend staying away from it. The meat was a bit tough to eat and there wasn't a ton of flavor on this but we ended up ordering enough food to not be starving. The Shells and cheese were good and while I did not think the BBQ pork would go well, it ended up being a solid dish and I was pleasantly surprised. The Korean chicken wings were Good and I bet they are probably considered very good given the lack of Korean restaurants in Charlotte. A good dish for the local market so props to them for it. The Cuban panini was very solid and definitely a crowd pleaser. The meats were tender and it was the right balance of all the ingredients to make it a tasty panini. The roll that we ordered ended up being solid for rolls. I don't eat too many rolls anymore but it tasted like a solid roll and the fish quality was good surprisingly. A hidden surprise and I think something that would do well in the CLT market.  All in all, I think the food was good at this joint. I actually want to give this joint a lot of props for trying a lot of different fusion combinations that while sound weird, actually ended up being Good in the end. I certainly think that it's a solid spot in the CLT dining scene and want to give them props for the risks they are taking for these unique recipes.",

First off I'd like to mention you should use the yelp waitlist feature because this small location will get a long wait of easily an hour to three.  The chefs and owners of this restaurant clearly took time to create amazing flavor fusions in their food that you won't likely find elsewhere. Highly recommend the pork belly tacos, as well as the ramen. The ramen was different from any ramen I've ever had before and really had a unique twist with great bold flavors. We also tried a couple sushi rolls, both were amazing but my particular favorite was the special of the day, and also the lamb lollipops were absolutely worth the price. Judging on the tasting I had with a sprinkle of things across the menu I can only assume everything they have to offer is amazing. That being said if you go with a group I'd recommend ordering a lot and sharing with the table so you can try a bit of all the unique flavors! (PS, while we didn't order it my friend said the only thing they've ever had that they didn't like was the white bean dip so maybe stay away from that!)",

While I knew this was a hipster tapa joint, I honestly expected more from a highly regarded pork belly taco. Isn't North Carolina known for it's BBQ & hence amazing meat preparation?  The pork belly was chewy vs melt in your mouth tastiness. Plus it was really just a pork belly tapa vs a taco because there was no way the measly flour shell could wrap around the large pork + watermelon layers.  It was decently busy, but Sunday busy so I expected better service. Honestly it nailed all the hipster bar cliches. Busy with loud music, over priced attempts at fusion food & prohibition style cocktails & stand offish people.   I'd come here with friends for a drink on a weekday, but not worth the hype IMO.",

Sushi, small plates, some southern-inspired dishes, everything freshly made in the kitchen that you can see if you look across the bar. This place is busy any night of the week, which is usually a good thing. The food has some great flavors, but the portion size is a little small for what you pay for. I got the pork belly tacos, for which they are known. You get 6 1\" cubes of pork belly with the same size and amount of pickled watermelon on two small tortillas.  The cocktails are also tasty, some of which are batch-made and are thus on-tap. They have some interesting twists on classic combinations, using bitters and cordials for for extra punches of flavor.",

The interior is very cool with the original exposed brick, that said when it's 30 degrees outside (not very often in CLT) you'll need to keep your coat on inside, it was cold! When I see a menu this large and so varied I tend to cringe...there's no way they can do all of these things really well. I was wrong. Ordering is tapas style which we love, sharing a bunch of plates.  Had the tacos w watermelon, Red Dragon sushi roll, ramen bowl, and Fries. All were very well done, great playing and strong tastes. The fries were our favorites, no need for sauce or condiments, tacos were cool, different and surprising. Ramen was legit great the broth is superb. Sushi was good but not amazing in our opinion, wish we would've ordered the stuffed shells that a table next to us got, they raved and it looked awesome. For dessert we had the bread pudding which was very good. Walked out with drinks 70$ for two of us....for this kind of food and ambiance that is super cheap. We will b back to try more of the menu!!",

    "text": "My husband just politely told me to update my Soul review, mainly due to 1 fact that has changed. The cocktails.  In my last review, I recommended not to get cocktails here. Since that point, my viewpoint has changed 180 degrees. Soul cocktail menu is very diverse and changes with the seasons. The bartenders use innovative techniques to create these pieces of art. Every single cocktail I have gotten has been totally delicious!!!  My opinion on the food has not changed. Everything is perfection. Pork belly tacos. Truffle fries. Ramen bowl. Pork belly stuffed shells. Some of my favs! We always end the night with a sushi roll (usually do the roll of the day) as a way to round out our fullness without spending a ton of money!!  Soul continues to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. We typically only go about once a year just to keep it special.",

I have tried the seaweed salad and it was fresh with just the right amount of sesame seeds. Chicken pita sandwich was huge! Tzatki sauce was so good. Perfect with red onions! The chicken was juicy. My favorite thing on the list is Korean wings. They talk a while to make but I promise you it is worth it. It was legit and I'm half Korean. I ate every last piece of meat on each wing and I had no shame licking my fingers. The sauce is spicy and the wings were crispy. Yum!!",

We arrived and there were booths available inside that could accommodate our group, but we were told there were no seats inside and were seated outside.... it was 30 degrees out. They had outdoor heaters but it was still uncomfortable at times. The waitress (Jean) was nice, however the manager was horrible! My brother in law wanted to try sushi for the first time but didn't realize that the Roll he had ordered was uncooked, when the food was brought out and he realized, he asked if he could swap it for a cooked sushi roll instead. After being told yes, the manager came out and said that the sushi section is shutting down, so either he keeps the roll and eat it or they would toss it out. No other alternatives!! Horrible service!! The rest of us ate, quickly paid and left to find somewhere else to hang out and get my brother in law something to eat. Needless to say, we won't be back. Ever.",

    "text": "So I got drunk one night in Charlotte and made some new friends.* Whenever there was a lull in our magniloquent discourse on the finer points of the economy, microbiology and NASCAR, I'd ask them where I might find the best meal in Charlotte. There was a lot of hemming and hawing from most people, but about 40% of them instantly pointed me toward Soul.  That kind of percentage can't be ignored, so when I was able to drag myself out of bed the next morning, I headed over for brunch.   I must admit that Soul and I got off on the wrong foot because they refused to serve me liquor before noon. However, once our server was able to gasp out (past my hands wrapped around his windpipe) that it was North Carolina's ridiculous law rather than their personal decision, we moved past it. And everything from that moment on was perfect, because everything included their shrimp and grits.   Our lovely waiter Marlon sold me on the dish, and it truly was architecturally interesting as he described. Instead of a bowl of shrimp and grits (as I'm used to), it was more like fried grit cubes with the shrimp and sauce poured over. And it was beautiful, rich, salty amazingness. The only downside was that I wanted more. (Her french toast panini was nothing to sneeze at either, but I'm a savor-tooth tiger to the core.)  I'm sure it would've been a better brunch with a bloody mary, but this was a meal I'll eat every time I'm in Charlotte, and you probably should too.  _________________  *Depending on your perspective, I suppose you could say that I bothered a lot of strangers.",

Don't expect to just walk in and get a seat - it's not uncommon for the wait to be hourS (yes, plural)! Pro tip though, download the NoWait app and get a place in line without having to physically walk in. Then just head up about 15 minutes before the expected seating time to get a drink. Be sure to keep your phone closeby because sometimes you're up earlier than expected and you only have 10 minutes to claim your table. Cocktails are good, but don't expect a hefty pour. I get the pork belly tacos every time! Flatbread and the duck are also delish. Skip the sushi, there are better places to get sushi in town.",

My dinner date and I arrived on a Saturday night at 5:00pm, when they first opened, and we were seated immediately.  I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  It has a trendy, young vibe.  Good music, alternative looking waitstaff, clean, yet interesting decor with the exposed ceiling beams and red brick walls.  We started with an x-rated martini and the drink special of the night, the cucumber-mint mojito.  While the martini was a bit over-priced ($11) and not that tasty in my opinion, I really enjoyed the mojito.  Typically mojitos are quantity over quality (aka low liquor content), but not this one.  There was a good balance of all of the flavors.  We picked from a wide array of items from the menu, from dips to small plates.  My favorite item was the asia pork-belly tacos with watermelon salsa.  Though this sounds like a strange combination of ingredients, it worked perfectly!  I love when dishes have contrasting tastes and textures that work together in harmony, and this hit the mark on both counts.  The garlic and truffle oil fries were really good as well, though I always love me a little extra truffle oil, which this lacked.  Our waiter, Justin, was awesome, he managed to always be there when we needed him for ordering another drink to bringing extra condiments, but he was not obnoxiously ever-present.  I will definitely go here again!  It is clear that this restaurant is run with an emphasis on giving each patron a quality, unique dining experience.",

    "text": "I'm throwing my lot in with Julia on this one. Soul is an Uptown restaurant that somehow got lost down Central Ave. Trapped on the wrong side of the tracks. It isn't comfortable here.  The food was nice enough. I was surprised at how much of the menu didn't appeal to me, but that's probably a function of them being adventurous cooks and me being a picky patron. Regardless, I found somethings I wanted, and when the food arrived (green onion hummus, salmon-o-pita, and mini-burgers) it was delicious. Not paradigm changing, but definitely worthwhile.  Yet the meal's experience was lacking. It had the loud, rowdy atmosphere of Plaza Midwood, but also the snobbery of aging Uptown frat boys. That is a weird combination. I like the Plaza Midwood energy. I can handle frats. But they don't work well together.  And vis-a-vis music, I prefer Twenty One downstairs.",

Normally, that would result in me trying someplace else but soul uses an app that allows you to monitor how many tables are ahead of you. So we went to common market for drinks while we waited. When we got back everything was awesome! They had a mussel feature that was delish. The guacamole stack is great with crispy bits of garlic. We also had the gyro skewers that we loved and a fantastic flatbread with pistachio pesto. Atmosphere is great and I highly recommend Jamie as a server. Very attentive and they have a great support staff. The fact that we could walk away made it feel like two hours was nothing. The experience made it even better!",

    "text": "I was in Charlotte for business and knowing NC was home to badass BBQ, I did serious research only to throw all of the pork BBQ joints out the window when I discovered that NC was host to an impressive array of home-grown chefs doing some amazing work with local ingredients.  Soul Gastrolounge seemed like such a funky place -- a hip lounge off the beaten path with sushi and Greek classics on the same menu. The space is small, but that's not a bad thing. Dark and intimate, I saddled up to an empty bar (I ate solo on the early side on a weeknight), ordered a PBR and decided to go to to work on some bone marrow, anchovy fries and saganaki. Obviously, I wasn't planning on hooking up wiht anyone later (which was very much appreciated by my wife back home).   The bone marrow was served alongside some pickled red onion, parsley and thin, toasted bread. I love that bone marrow is making a foodie comeback -- poor people's food now finding its way onto respectable menus and savored for the deliciousness it's always been. The acidity of the red onion/parsley cut the richness of the beef butter just right. The only complaint I have is that the toast points were too thin and too crispy to properly soak up the richness once it melted into the bread.  The anchovy fries were True rockstar food as I don't have many friends that would join me in this adventure. I love the saltiness of a fresh anchovy. Dredging them in flour (cornstarch, perhaps) and flash-frying them made an already good thing amazing. The lemon aioli that came accompanied it was proper -- those little fishy fishes vanished quickly in between bites of bone marrow slathered toast and...  So I had never had saganaki - this beauty of fried, then ouzo-flambed cheese that Greeks have enjoyed for generations -- until this fateful night. And wow -- worth the wait. Perhaps, I didn't need the extra dose of saltiness given my anchovy fries and pickled red onions, but the salty cheese was incredibly satisfying -- especially when washed down by a cold, domestic brew.   Soul Gastrolounge boasted quite an impressive menu of small plates and if I was a local, I'd make a point to hit them all. The bar was a perfect place to perch as it allowed me to watch the team of cooks prepare my meal. Given the size of the kitchen, which is about the size of my coat closet, these guys and girls really know what they're doing and are so intentional in what they serve their loyal fans. Charlotte is lucky to have them around.",

I do have a few new recommendations though: Shrimp ceviche - hell yes! Light coconut flavor served with a plantain chip mmmm. Also the mojitos are delicious! I wish they added some fruit varieties besides mango (too sweet for me) but they are definitely worth having (served in a pint glass - not some dinky small glass)",

I love the tapas situation because I got to try so many things. The first time I came I LOVED the flatbread, pork belly tacos, shrimp ceviche, and salmon pita. I couldn't decide which I liked best. We also got the lamb skewers which I'd give 7/10--pretty good but nothing exciting next to the other things we ordered. This was TOO MUCH FOOD, and we only ate about half and took the rest home. Depending on what you order I would say 3, maybe 4 dishes is good for 2 people. We also got a Sapporo each, which ended up coming in a HUGE can, 2 full drinks worth. All that plus tip came out to around 70$ if i remember correctly. Considering how much I'd heard about how pricey Soul is I thought it was a good deal and totally worth it for what we got.  The second time I came we got the lamb lollipops, the dip trio and the tuna tacos. All were great, especially the lamb (although not worth 20$) but I wasn't as blown away as I was the first time.  I've yet to try the sushi but WOW it looked good when I saw it being brought to other tables!  Both times we went on a Tuesday around 6:30 and were seated right away.",

We used the Yelp application to get on the wait-list and was sat almost right when we walked in. The exposed brick of the restaurant combined with the unique lighting was very appealing. Marlon was our server and he was INCREDIBLE. Well-spoken, knew the menu, made great suggestions and held great conversation. My date and I started off with the Godzilla Roll and Cheese Panini. Both very tasty. I then ordered the Lamb Skewer and she ordered the Mini Burgers. 3rd round consisted of Piquillo Pepper Toasts and Gyro Skewer. Everything was so good, my least favorite was the Gyro Skewer... it was just meat on a stick and a bit dry. My favorite... oh man. Those Lamb Skewers were incredible.

It's served with no extra filling, which means you focus on the succulence and sweetness of the meat alone. Absolutely divine.  Soul also makes the best flatbread I've ever had. It's made with truffle whipped goat cheese, pistachio pesto, honey braised garlic, and fresh arugula.   The Not-So-Good  Oh my god, the wait. We went at about 8:00 on a Friday night and the hostess said it would be a 2.5 hour wait. We walked over to Workman's Friend instead. Determined to try it again, we came back the next night at about the same time. This time a 2 hour wait. Luckily we found bar stools to get comfortable and ultimately decided to eat at the bar.  We ordered mules. We were thrown off that it's served on tap. And way, way too sweet.   The shells and cheese, made with BBQ glazed pork belly, were unremarkable. I wish we ordered the pork belly tacos instead. The fried meatballs didn't wow me either.  So, in summary, a few items on the menu blew me away enough to still give Soul my 4-star rating. Order the eel, flatbread, and prepare yourself for the wait.",

    "text": "I always come to this place expecting a wait, however after my recent experience I will never be coming back here again.    First of all, my friend and I were told that the wait would be an hour and a half to two hours, fine, we weren't expecting much less anyway.  In reality we weren't seated for three hours, and it would have been longer if my friend and I weren't walking out the door.  The issue was that instead of giving us our well deserved table, the host was allowing his \"friends\" to cut in front of us.  This is, in my opinion, completely unacceptable.     My second biggest issue involves the bartender.  To pass time my friend and I were going to have some drinks at the bar, but our experience was terrible.    I am absolutely unashamed to call out the bartender right now.  Although I don't know his name, I can describe him. He has very strange hair that is shaved on one side and flipped on the other, and wears these steam-punk inspired glasses.  Let me say, this guy is a complete jerk and should not be working in the hospitality industry PERIOD.   My friend and I were  standing at the bar waiting for a drink for 45 minutes.  He was blatantly ignoring us.  Everytime I waved at him he would say \"I will get to you in a minute\" however, during this period at least 10 other people, if not more, were served who were not waiting before us and just got to the bar.  In fact, some girl walked up to the left side of the bar after we were patiently waiting, (which by the way is not allowed) and was served.  This happened not once, but twice, and no she was not a waitress.  Finally when I was able to get my drink from him he asked for my I.D.  which is totally fine except I was already being served alcoholic beverages.  When I told this his was response was \"you should take that as a compliment\".  I honestly believe the only reason he made me take out my I.D was to harass me and make my life more difficult since my friend and I were obviously getting upset with him.      Bottom line is, the wait sucked but if I had a pleasurable experience at the bar it wouldn't have mattered.  Not to mention my friend and I were planning on drinking a lot so the bartender screwed his own pocket out of valuable tips, as well as the restaurant.  Because of that, I will not be coming back to this place, which I am a pretty frequent customer of.  This gentleman may be a good bartender, but it is blatantly obvious that he shows favoritism to certain customers and I hope that the restaurant sees this review and takes it into consideration whether to keep him or not.  My review doesn't do it justice how rude he was.  On a side note, the other male bartender was very charming.",

But that only speaks to how great this place is. We went around 7:30 hoping to have a few drinks and bites before heading uptown. Until we were told the wait was about 3 hours! So we went uptown and had dinner first and came back after 10:30pm on Saturday. We had drinks and dessert. I had the The Secretary. What a wonderful drink. Somewhat spicy and strong with grapefruit bitters and basil. A VERY nice combination. The wife had the chocolate bread pudding. I'm not a fan of bread pudding but I must say, it was delish. It was very loud so we could hardly hear each speak. After 10 the dj begins playing the flavor of the night. Frankly, We are fans of the earlier hours. But still, what a great place for drinks and food!",

When we arrived, our party was incomplete so we had a drink at the bar. Thumbs up for the local beers on tap. We then moved to a table nearby and started ordering a feast. As everyone else has stated, the pork belly tacos are AMAZING. Just get them. We also ordered the soul roll, the Brussels sprouts, and a flatbread... And devoured almost every bite. The service was great and our server was down to earth and made a lot of great recommendations. We sat at the short little table by the door so we were on the love seat/living room furniture but that was okay cause it was comfy. I will definitely come back here when I'm in the area, especially because there are decent bars nearby to go to after!",

It's a cute spot in Plaza so I always try to give it a chance, but the management and staff are terrible.  Management is young with no training and no experience.  Hostesses are so relaxed and do not care about customers.  The bartenders openly make fun of people in the restaurant.  As for the wait, there is always one! I've been twice when the booths have been available but because my group wasn't at least 4 people, they've asked us to wait.  One time we literally waited 45 minutes with no one sitting at two of the booths.   I've been at different times and days and it's always the same.  My last visit we were there at 6:00 pm on a Wednesday with several open tables but none available for two people so they lost our business.   I gave Soul two stars because their food is unique.",

Our server was nice and explained the menu and made some recommendations. The cucumber mule, which they have on tap, was entirely too sweet and I ended up trading it in for a glass of prosecco. The brussel sprouts were tasty, but not anything special. The BBQ pork stuffed macaroni shells were a flavor combination that didn't work, the pork was too sweet, and the white cheddar cheese sauce had an odd texture, bordering on slimy. The Caesar salad was ok, but, due to their anything-goes coursing style, was the last dish we received. Again, nothing special. I would have tried more things, but was too disappointed to spend any more money for such mediocre small plates. Great concept, lovely space (although there is zero street signage and it's up a flight of stairs), but I was not impressed at all. Will not return.",

    "text": "I don't really see what all of the hype is about? We waited two hours to be seated.  I tried several dishes. There was a white dip that came with pita bread - the pita almost broke off a tooth. I ate some of the truffle fries that my friend raved about, and those lacked in flavor as well. I tried three of the sushi rolls. They didn't have a standout flavor. I expected something special based on word of mouth. There was a bone in my roll, so they did not charge me for it. The chocolate bread pudding was delicious and  was the best part of my meal. I would return for the bread pudding and maybe to try some drinks when the place is less busy.",

    "text": "Great spot in Charlotte! Really varied and unique food and cocktail menu. Probably my favorite restaurant in Charlotte so far. Made me feel like I was back in NYC , without the douche bags and shitty aspects. Standouts: Soul Roll, kamachi special, Korean BBQ wings, shrimp skewers. Pistachio Ice cream was awesome too. Great date spot or group of friends to chill with tapas-style food and drinks.",

Fantastic beer selection, we shared garlic truffled fries, and Muy Beueno Roll (sushi).  Our server was awesome, we will definitely be back!!",
