My girlfriend and I went to Poplar StreetCafe for for wine and apps looking for a peaceful place to catch up and it couldn't have been cozier or more perfect with amazing service and great music. We had the hummus, and quiche of the day with a bottle of wine followed by the passion fruit mousse. All was amazing - highly recommend this place!! Alvaro was also so great!! Great place, great night :)",

The food is delicious and resonates with both the new up and coming Charlotte flare as well as the timeless class you can only find in a city such as ours.  The staff is warm and outgoing, and there is a great variety of wine and local beer available for those who are working there till 5, or 4 in my case.  There are generous spaces to work, and play, and feel free to relax and take in the Charlotte sun in outdoor seating or swing on the deck swing while enjoying a cocktail.   Speaking of working, for us work from homers, could I suggest switching out the power outlets to 3 prong so I can work there longer than what the battery in my laptop allows?   Keep up the good work over there.  An absolute must visit in Charlotte.",

One of the reviews mentioned it being pricey - I actually found it to be very reasonably priced for the quality of food we ate that night! If you are used to chain restaurants, then this may not be the place for you. If you like style, ambience, romantic settings with good food, then this is the place for you! We ordered a bottle of wine and a bunch of tapas, including dessert. We did not leave hungry at all and really thought the entire experience of Poplar was incredible. We will be back - soon - and have told all our friends about this place! It was not super busy on a Saturday night- I hope this place is around for a long time to come.",

    "text": "What a precious little spot! I don't know where to begin since there's so much underneath one roof! Let's start with the house itself. It's one of the long standing homes in a city that is constantly torn down and replaced with stucco and mirrored glass. It has been lovingly restored and is a gem of a home with historical ties to the city. Local artists' paintings adorn the walls and add more character.   My husband loves the back room where the bar is since it's tucked away, yet has a great feel.  Then there's the food. It's a simple menu that doesn't overwhelm, yet so delicious and everything is made in house. The appetizers, salads, and sandwiches do NOT disappoint! Delicious ceviche, and stuffed mushrooms that I could never get tired of eating. I've yet to have anything here that I didn't like. Then there's desserts, desserts, DESSERTS!! When you first walk in the house, there's a pastry case that honestly gives a popular local bakery a serious run for their money!! The passion fruit mousse is a must try!! I admit that I have a serious sweet tooth and these desserts are made with 100% love!  Be sure to go when they have live music on Tuesday and Friday nights. There is a small patio are out front and it's like having a relaxing night at a friend's house. Very simple: great little bar, relaxing ambiance,  and excellent food all downtown. It doesn't get any better!",

It's located in a historic house on Poplar St. (hence the name), and tucked just enough away from other hot spots uptown. We were surprised to find out it had been open for over a year while they had been doing renovations and not much advertising. There are so many of the house's original details which added to the ambiance. I had a fantastic mojito, followed by a light rose'. The bar selection was nice and I thought well priced. While the food was tasty, I thought the flavors were definitely safe. All light in flavor, too. There was someone singing bluesy covers in another room, and at no point did we feel rushed which was pretty fantastic. I truly loved the feel and vibe of this spot and can't wait for warmer weather and their patio seating to open!",

    "text": "I live in the 4th Ward, when I heard this place was opening, I was so excited to have a place like this in my neighborhood!  Unfortunately, that is where the good experience ends. The first time I tried Poplar, myself and a friend were sitting outside enjoying wine and apps and then seemingly out of nowhere, the place was closing on us.  We literally had just ordered another glass, our server did not tell us it was closing and then 5 minutes later the owner came out asking us how much longer we will be.  Very disappointing experience.  The 2nd incident I had with Poplar was this weekend. I called about an hour we walked down and the owner let us know that \"of course, we are open!  We have a new guitar player, playing tonight and we are open until 10!\" I say all of this as it would be COMPLETELY understandable if she said we are not open but she did not and even after I asked again giving the current situation uptown, she said \"no, we are definitely open!\" So I was disappointed again when we walked down there and there was a sign saying they are closed due to the events of the past week.   I'm not really sure, when she decides to close but it would have been considerate to say at this point we are open, but we are playing it by ear and might close.  That would also be COMPLETELY understandable and I would not be leaving this disappointed review.  I did give the place 3 stars for its potential, but the owner needs some coaching on how to run a successful restaurant that garners repeat, loyal customers.",

I loved the southern feel with the porch and soft lights.   We came in for a late dinner 30 min before closing on a Wednesday, and there was no sense of rushing from the staff. There were tons of fun seating options - alfresco, a couple dining rooms, and a bar - all thoughtfully situated in a house. We opted for an indoor dining room seat by a window. I loved the authentic feel, which also made it romantic. Pictures don't do it justice.  The menu had nice variety. The hubby and I ordered the tasty sangria and pisco sour to start. We then ordered the prosciutto wrapped honey figs, shrimp ceviche that came with flatbread, and a panini that was delicious (I think the charcuterie one).   It was a perfect last minute dinner, and I would definitely love to come back for some of the live music and seeing the space during the daylight for some brunch. It's an Excellent find!",

Also service was slightly spotty. We waited a looong time for our food (table that came after us was served faster) then everything came at once. Food was fairly good but could benefit from another type of greens as garnish. All 4 of our tapas had the same arugula!  We'd be willing to try again but only if we could sit outside where it would not be so loud.",

    "text": "We came here a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time. Decided to come back last night (9/29) for a couple of drinks before our anniversary dinner and it was a complete failure. First, someone from the restaurant posted on their Facebook page that their cocktails were $7 each. When we arrive, our waiter says that is not their special for the night and I mention that it was posted on Facebook and so he goes to speak to the manager. After he spoke to a couple of different people, he finally found out he could honor what they posted online. While waiting for our drinks to arrive, we hear another server speaking to the table next to us and they ask if the sparkling wine is half off and the server said not tonight, but the cocktails were $7. The only issue with that is there was a big chalk board on the way in that stated sparkling wine was half off. I feel they may need to start the afternoon with a staff meeting so everyone can be on the same page.   Now comes the drinks. We each had a different cocktail and I don't think either of them had a single drop of alcohol. This is in complete contrast to our prior experience. I think they purposefully made the drinks this way seeing that I had them honor the special that they posted online. I spoke to the manager about this, who was not friendly at all, and he just walked back to the table and took the drinks without even saying a word to the person I was with. Extremely unprofessional and I would have not expected this, at all, from this type of bar/restaurant. So they take the drinks back to the bar, say they add more alcohol to the same drink, re-shake it and bring the same drinks back out...utterly ridiculous that you would not just make us a new drink the correct way. I had the mojito and it still was not made properly. According to their menu, it was supposed to have Bacardi and Captain. If there is Captain Morgan Rum in a drink, the drink will have a brown tint to it since it's a spiced rum. There was no brown tint at all.   To my stupidity, I decide to give them another try and order a second round of cocktails. It was just like the first time where they were extremely watered down and you couldn't even taste the alcohol in the drink. See other reviews of this place that state the same thing.  Lastly, I overheard that there is a new manager at this place and I have to say, they should have found a different person to run the show here. He doesn't have any of the characteristics that a manager of this sort of place should have.",

    "text": "Shocked by all the positive reviews. My husband and I went for dinner last night and had a terrible experience. We ordered 4 items and received only some of what was ordered. The charcuterie plate was missing multiple items, only one kind of cheese was served (supposed to be 3) and instead of pesto aioli there was a dollop of standard mayonnaise, all served on a bed of wilted arugula. Yikes! Next were the tacos, drenched in the same mayonnaise despite the menu not indicating this. The chicken kebabs consistent of poor quality charred meat. Our final item, the kale and quinoa salad with honey lime dressing, came drenched in (you guessed it!) a ton of mayonnaise, no honey or lime in sight. In addition, there was no staggering of the food, it all came out at once and was plopped down on our small table after which we never saw our waiter again. To make matters worse, the wine portions were tiny for the price. A truly disappointing experience. Advice to the chef: if you don't have the ingredients, don't put it on the menu, dousing the \"tapas\" in mayonnaise is not the solution.",

Situated in a historic house, Poplar's interior, exterior, and magical patio are just great. We opt for patio seating whenever we go, and on Friday and Saturday there's live music as well - always great people playing.  The food is wonderful too - we've had a big variety of things from ceviche to mac n' cheese, to the cheese plate, to the wrapped figs, and every time we order something new we're never disappointed.  I know they have wine as one of their three points, but the wine list isn't very extensive, and there's about a 50% margin in what you get compared to if you bought it at a shop... instead, opt for the cocktails. The mixed drinks are for the most part well priced and always flavorful and refreshing. The Lady likes gin drinks and there's plenty to go around here - AND Poplar is one of two places in Charlotte that sells Pisco Sours, a big draw. Located IN uptown but not quite in the bustle of things is a huge draw, so we'll absolutely keep on coming back to this awesome little house.",

The interior is beautiful and cozy. There was live music and the guy was really good, he played Journey, Stevie Wonder, TV themes, everything. And what you want to know is how was the food, it was really tasty and priced well. We also got coffee beverages. This is a great date night place or just a cozy outing with a friend. I would definitely recommend it!",

The outside is very inviting, it hosts an array of seating much like your grandma's house in the countryside if she were to throw a party for you and your friends. From the looks of the house, it almost seemingly resembles a regular home.   When you enter the front door, there are places to sit in many different rooms, which each have a small, retired fireplace. The indoors is lined with tiny decorative items that are like an owner's memorabilia.   This place is classy and very charming. The brooding, jazzy music fits the aura. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The food is also pretty good, yet it's not your classic idea of Spanish tapas. Come here for a drink and good discussions, and you'll leave satisfied.",

    "text": "Poplar Street Tapas, Cafe, & Bar provides an inviting ambience and something for everyone. Situated in The Morrison House, a historic landmark nestled in Fourth Ward, Poplar Street keeps the natural interior room structure which provides cozy alcoves in which one could read for hours without interruption, work on laptops with a business team, grab cocktails with friends, or whisper in a lover's ear. Poplar Street manages to offer a varied menu, from charcuterie and cocktails to quiche and coffee, while maintaining a clear vision and minimalist attitude.  I went in to Poplar Street Tapas, Cafe, & Bar to get a quick coffee on a hot Charlotte afternoon. Immediately upon entering I was drawn to the counter on my left, where customers can order anything from the menu (wait service is an option after 2 PM). The desserts, the creations of one the owner's sister-in-law, were just gorgeous and seasonal. Unable to help myself, I ordered the passion fruit mousse. The mousse, covered with a thin layer of whipped cream and topped with blueberries and a strawberry, was a taste of heaven: tart, creamy, fluffy. I had to restrain myself from licking the cute glass clean!  The iced vanilla coffee I ordered was exactly as I expected, I did not have to add milk or sugar. But the passion fruit mousse really stole the show. The desserts are not listed on the menu because they change depending on the season and the whims and inspirations of the pastry chef. Also, pastries are delivered on Mondays or Tuesdays. I came in on a Thursday and I got the last mousse, but there was still passion fruit cake, \"sexy\" triple chocolate cake, strawberry shortcake, tiramisu, peach tart, tres leches, dulce de leche cheesecake, and raspberry chocolate cake. The waitress apologized for the \"limited\" options, so I cannot imagine what it's like on a Monday! I will have to come back and see. And I might have to buy a slice of passion fruit cake to hold me over until then...",

I have been here twice now and it's been exceptional both times. It's such a cute and romantic little spot. It gives you a warm southern welcome as soon as you step on the property. The hanging lights in the trees, the front porch swing and the creaking old door looks like it was stolen a Nicholas Sparks set...and it's right in the city!   They let us seat ourselves both times and it was hard to choose between the historic classy rooms or the outdoor patio. Our waitress gave us a tour of the cafe and filled us in on the history of the house.   The waitress was so sweet and welcoming. She memorized all of our orders and they came out perfectly...I was so impressed. I don't know how she did it! She even brought me a sample cheese plate to choose which one I liked for my salad. I didn't even ask her to do that.   We started with asian chicken skewers, the hummus plate and a charcuterie board. All of the starters were great. Rich with flavor and enough to fill the whole table of four. I LOVED the hummus and the way they grilled the warm pitas for dipping. *they should serve veggies with that plate.  I ordered the Arugula Pear Salad: Arugula / Anjou Pear / Gorgonzola / Walnuts / Olive Oil Lime Dressing + Chicken  The salad was HUGE and all of the flavors went so perfectly together. I was full after eaten half but it was so good I couldn't stop. Their homemade dressing was a hit! I'd love to get my hands on that recipe.   All of the meals/appetizers were very inexpensive and you get a lot of food. My friends ordered paninis and those were just as great. We all passed around the food having each other try them.   Dessert and coffee is a must. It's a place you won't want to rush out of. My boyfriend even had fun serenading everyone on the piano.   Why only four stars? A couple things...  1. They should serve veggies with their hummus plate. 2. They should open their coffee/dessert bar early mornings.  3. I wish they were open on Sunday and only closed on Monday. 4. I wish they had weekend breakfasts.  5. I wish they'd post more on their social media/instagram. (weird i know) I'd be happy to take over that task for them.   This is a place I want to bring all of my friends and family who visit from out of town and a place I hope stays open forever because I love it! It would be great for meetings and events.",

Charcuteria was torturously salty and the chicken dish was not great. Both dishes were too expensive for the content. For the drinks, one was too watery and the other tasted like bad vodka! They don't have waiters and no one is here to serve the tables. The hostesses and boss boys were serving and wait time for food was so long we were wonder what they did for preparing such simple dishes.   We had high hopes for this place. Won't come back here again.",

    "text": "Welp, looks as though I've found my new spot. Looooooooove this place. The driver dropped us off out front and we were already impressed, gorgeous house with a lovely sitting area out front. We opted to sit inside because it was just so inviting, perfectly dim lighting, subtle music in the background, comfy seats and not a tv in sight! I don't want to mislead you though, the food is NOT 5 stars, maybe a 3, MAAAAYYBBE. But everything else more than makes up for that.  As others have mentioned the menu is simple, but I am a fan of that. Wednesday is half off wines by the glass or bottle so we went straight for a bottle, why not when with the discount it was a total steal. For food we ordered the meat and cheese board, spinach with garlic in white wine and wild mushrooms in red wine. The spinach and mushrooms desperately needed salt, and were very heavy in garlic. The meat and cheese board while nothing fancy was really good. This is probably what I will get every time.  If you are looking for an intimate date spot or a place to hang with friends in cozy and classy digs with excellent service look no further than POPLAR.",

Nikki, you did another fabulous event with a lovely place to explore and get to know the wonderful people that make it so special...  Trish is so welcoming and kind and really helped so many of us enjoy our time there.  Fernando was amazing as well and was making delicious drinks for us all.  I tried the Lucia's Pisco and it was so good.    All of the food was delicious as well and I appreciated the efforts of the kitchen and serving staff to keep up with so many people.  The figs with proscuitto were my favorite followed by the Chorizo flat.  I enjoyed meeting some new people that I hadn't talked with before and had a wonderful time and stayed after to enjoy some more food and drink and camaraderie!  I have been back twice since the event, bringing new people in with me because I really fell in love with this restaurant/bar/location...  and they have live music on some nights as well on the front patio.    Thank you again for providing us with a great adventure in Charlotte!  Cheers to the day!",

Let's start at the scallops... what an amazing sear! Clearly some quality scallops pored with a smooth butternut squash puree. The surprise on this dish was the crunch of the hazelnuts. The combo of textures kept me wanting more.   Next was pork belly. Not just any pork belly but an amazing crust, tender pork, and buttery fat. I don't usually like sweet with my meat, but the passion fruit wasn't overpowering and balanced the intense savory flavor. The little potatoes were perfectly cooked.   Finally we had the steak skewers. The meat was tender and perfectly sized. The bright sauce with the pico like salsa helped balance the dish.   I've previously had the Mac and cheese, tres leches, chicken tacos and panini. The menu has changed a bit but nothing has disappointed.   The wine selection is fantastic and the sangria is amazing on a hot day.",

I recently got my Yelp Elite status update for Charlotte and this was my first event and it did NOT disappoint. At first it was slow going and I was afraid that the only thing I would be able to write about was an Sangria, red wine and an empty white plate.   But Trish and Fernando (general manager) made me and Maria's evening. And no I didn't come with Maria ..she a yelp Elite as well whom I hit it off with along with two other amazing folks.   Maria and I stayed after the event and we had some amazing tapas dishes that were so good that we will definitely be back soon. We ordered steak, and crispy pork belly and scallops and all of it was manna from the Gods. But don't take my work for it... check out my pictures.

I also had their red sangria which was refreshing. If I worked or lived uptown this would be a place I wouldn't mind enjoying during lunch or on a nice Saturday afternoon.

The ambiance is top shelf and the food was stellar. Most importantly, the service was impecable.

    "text": "I honestly didn't think this place was as great as others had mentioned in the reviews. The place was cute, it was a house. There was seating inside and out and if it wasn't so chilly I would have sat outside where there was more people. Inside was very dark and quiet and there was only one other couple there. I went with my girl friend, so it more of a place to bring a date. The prices were a bit high I felt for small plates. I also ordered a sangria and it did not taste freshly made and nor did it have any fruit. The other table that was since got bread, but we did not. After I ordered the hummus as a bite, and the vegetables were a stale and soft so I know they weren't prepped the same day. I probably won't come back. I rather try other places in town.",

    "text": "I don't give negative reviews often but we were so disappointed with our service that I felt it necessary. From not being greeted at our table for 15 minutes, to inaccurate info about dishes, to not having utensils until we asked twice, the list goes on. Some of the dishes were good, some were just \"eh\". I really wanted to love this place & the atmosphere is great, but everything else suffered in comparison. With so many good restaurants in town, we won't be back.",

My favorite menu items are the ceviche, quesos board and Mac and cheese. Dylan is the best server! Definitely check this place out before patio season ends.",

The panini my husband got was delicious and the Mac and cheese too! I had the chicken tacos and they were fine- avocado tasted very fresh! My cocktail tasted great. We will definitely return here!",

We ordered drinks, a cucumber water for me and an old fashioned for hubs. Both were great, we also ordered the figs wrapped in prosciutto and they were to die for, so delish!! I will definitely be back! This would be a great place for a GTO. Service was excellent!",
