    "text": "Went in and sat in the bar area. The bartender was also our waitress. She immediately took our drink orders and brought us chips and salsa. We ordered a couple margaritas and some queso.  The house margarita needs work, tastes like OJ with tequila.  However, the frozen Mango margarita was delicious!  We ordered a combination plate and carnitas. The enchilada and burrito were not very good, the enchilada sauce was very runny with virtually no flavor.  The poblano was really good with chicken.  The carnitas were not pulled apart, the meat came in large chunks, no biggie, had great flavor.  The food overall was ok, satisfied the craving for Mexican food, but not great for a $40 dinner.  However, the service was great! The bartender and staff were on top of taking orders, delivering and picking up plates! Great job on service!",

The 2 stars is because they no longer have limes!(trying to get a response) I ordered a margarita (ultimate which was very good) and when I asked for a lime the bartender said they had stopped ordering them because they were too expensive! Now granted this didn't make or break my meal but that was one of the strangest things I have heard. It wasn't like it was $2 margarita night ($9 to be exact) Hopefully someone in management will see this and respond. If you like a lime with your margarita or your Mexican beer you may want to pass until they they make a better business decision",

    "text": "Mediocre service was the highlight.  Seriously.  Let's start at the beginning.  We were seated in a booth, and given menus.  This wouldn't be at all odd, but my preschool aged kids were also given menus, and not the kind you can color on--adult menus.  Odd, but you don't lose any points for that.  After sitting for what seemed like a really long time, we had the opportunity to order beverages--the kids had chocolate milk which arrived in a styro-cup with a lid intact, but no straws.  We had to actually ask for straws, and then watched as our confused waitress visited every table in our section straws in hand, trying to figure out who needed them before solving the puzzle.  The food came and it was atrocious to put it mildly.  I burned my elbow against my plate, which would have been somewhat my fault, if I didn't have a taco salad.  The lettuce was hot, the tomatoes were hot, the cheese was hot.  I suspect they cooked the whole thing, plate and all in an oven.  I might have gotten past it, if the beef weren't swimming in soup at the bottom of the soggy taco shell.    I also ordered chicken tacos, which had dry flavorless meat, cheese which tasted like processed mozzarella string cheese, and nothing else.  Bleh.  I didn't finish either dish.  My wife ordered steak ranchero tacos, which came with a decent presentation, but my wife said they were also flavorless.  She offered me her last taco, but I'll take her word for it, that it was bland.  After trying to coax my kids into eating their quesadillas, I decided to take a bite myself, and wanted to cry.  Picture melted string cheese encasing a frozen chicken strip.  Next time we are craving decent Mexican, (which is almost always, since we are California transplants), we are driving the extra 10 minutes to Tequila in Rock Hill.  The place looks like a dive inside and out, but the food and service has never disappointed.",

My wife's order was wrong (no chicken inside a wrap) and my chicken enchiladas were acidic, runny green sauce that looked like it was poured on top right out of a can and I had to douse the rice with salt and pepper. The waiter had a look of frustration like he was used to unhappy customers. The staff and the manager were friendly enough and the manager was very apologetic and didn't argue with me about my dislike of the quality of the food and my refusal to pay.

I seem to always get the same waitress every time I go there: a young blonde girl. She does not need to be a server.

Then asked how many not even looking at me.  I stated I was picking up an order, then she said go over to the bar -and literally walked away.  Wow....bad enough I wasn't feeling well and picking up some soup for myself, but to be treated like I was \"bothering\" them is another thing. Was I really going to give them my $?    When I ordered, I specifically asked if the soup was a good portion. Said yes, yes. good.  Uh ok....the container wasn't even all the way full & the chips taste a bit stale.  The mild salsa that was given, not even half full in this small container.  They weren't very friendly-the only one who smiled was the man behind the bar.    The soup is good and ordered a side as well.  The portions are not what I would call standard or even decent.  I wish El Cancun was still open, sad they closed, because when you ordered any food, you got what you paid for!  Looks like I will be searching for another Mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "What the heck is up with the guy who makes fresh guac at the tables ringing a bicycle bell attached to the his push cart as he walks around the restaurant? I'm not kidding. Tacky and annoying.   My family and I ate here a few days ago and will not be returning. We've been several times and sometimes is very good, sometimes it's average. The salsas (mild, hot and extra hot) are good sometimes but just plain boring other times. I'm completely baffled by the comments saying the salsa is awesome. The only reason we have returned is because our kids ask to go there. I guess they are easily impressed. ;-) We won't go back, though. Our food was boring. I can make food of the same quality at home and I'm not even a very good cook. It was bland and they do not put any garnish on the dinners we've ordered.  American Mexican food almost always has at least a small amount of lettuce, tomato and possibly sour cream and guac. One of the items in my dinner was a tostada. It consisted of the shell, beans and cheese; that's it. Umm, no. Can you say cheap-o restaurant? Plus, my tostada was completely soggy. I sent it back along with the rest of my dinner. I'm from Arizona, Mexican food is my favorite and I've eaten in hundreds of times. I've never been served a tostada like that. Gross.   I had an issue with my meal as mentioned above and when the server, who was very polite, could not resolve it we asked to speak to the manager. This manager is just not customer service centered at all and proceeded to argue with me over something that she was clearly in the wrong about. I've had a bad experience with this same manager in the past as well. She should not be working in a restaurant. I was nice to her. She was a jerk to me both times.   Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere.",

The hostesses were not friendly, did not ask if we wanted to sit indoors or out, and although the restaurant was mostly empty, took us to a booth next to the kitchen door in the bar (what I would consider one of the worst tables in the house). When I ask for a different table, she wasn't very happy about it.  We were seated and given menus, our server (who was nice but poorly trained) took our drink orders. He brought our waters, chips and salsa (and he mixed up which was the mild and which was the spicy salsa) but it was a good 10 minutes before our drinks from the bar arrived. We requested napkins (at this point we didn't have any napkins or silverware). We had to ask for napkins 2-3 times before we got some.  Our food was delivered on screaming hot plates (definitely had been sitting under the warmer for a while. My Chili Pablanos were soggy because they had been sitting around for a while. We still had no silverware at this point. Again we asked for it and finally received the pre-rolled cheap silverware in a napkin.  Our server was fairly attentive but not great. As we were leaving the restaurant, there was a large group of folks at the hostess stand waiting to be seated and the three hostesses who had been working earlier in the evening were no where to be found.  Definitely will not be going there again!!!!  As we drove by Taco Bell on the way home, I commented to my husband that we could have gotten an equal quality meal there for much less money.",

It's your standard Mexican restaurant with colorful decor and Mexican mariache music playing.

The margaritas are huge (even the medium), and the chips and salsa are free... and fine. The fella got a taco/burrito combo, and he said it was good. I got the fajitas carnitas, and they were fine.

It was a co-workers birthday and they gave us a little dessert (enough for all but one of us...but hey, it's free), and they put a big sombrero on him while singing, a nice touch!   I ordered the shrimp fajitas. There was only really 5-6 shrimp on a huge bed of onions (and some red bell pepper sprinkled in). On the plus side the shrimp tasted great and were cooked nicely. I also really liked the rice it was served with.    I  thought it was weird that my co-worker and I ordered the same thing but they only brought one container of tortillas. I would rather have had my own as it's kind of gross to put your hands on something someone else is eating.

Everyone understands there is sauce on the enchilada, so it seems like they might have separated that from the other two items, especially the hand-held taco. Instead, it arrived all on one plate, with the saucy enchilada in the middle. Picking up the taco without getting enchilada sauce all over my hands would have been impossible. They were nice to bring me another taco and take the sauced one away.   Also, it was my first time here and no one explained the fresh guacamole cart upfront. When it hit my table, I wasn't sure if it was complimentary or if I would be charged for it, so I passed.  The tip container on the container was right at eye level. Couldn't miss that.   The enchilada was nicely seasoned, but the chicken was a bit on the dry side. The ground beef on the taco and tostada was decent, if a little greasy, and it needed salt IMO. Chips were good, as was the salsa.   I might try this place again when I am in town.",

I am glad there are more authentic options in Fort Mill (La Poblanita).  This also seems to be a place for the families of Baxter Village to bring their hyper kids.

Unfortunately for us, it was in the bar area. Normally, I am fine with this is there are a bevy of servers; however, that was not the case here. One server was pretty much running around making margaritas and serving tables, so service was so-so. Music was very questionable, like Latin Hip-hop unedited versions. Strange. Another thing we noticed was the flavor and portions were smaller. Oh well, lesson learned- stick to parts you know sometimes. :)",

    "text": "I recently visited this place for the first time and came back a second the following week. You can judge a Mexican place by their rice and beans (just as you can judge a Chinese place by their fried rice - if they put peas in their fried rice, get outta there). The rice and beans are on point.   I ordered some sort of cheesy burrito (melted nacho cheese on the top and sides). It was really good. When you sit down they bring you chips and salsa. The first time the salsas we're pretty bland, but the second time one had a deep flavor which was great. Rather than the two red salsas, they should drop the mild (as their hot is mild) and add a tomatillo. Anyways, the chips are thin and crunchy and went well with the cheese from the burrito.   The second time I went I had a beef stew burrito topped with cheese (again) and green salsa. It was great again. I wanted to try their horchata but they were out. I'm working my way up to carnitas.   The environment looks like a typical Mexican restaurant (pretty unimaginative), but it seemed clean, so that's good. I only liked when they played traditional mariachi music versus some contemporary noise. The service is pretty good. Mario was our server the first time and he was incredibly nice so I'll be asking for him again.   It's the best Mexican/Latin food in the area. Sabor might seem hip but lacks authenticity and honestly it's bland and inconsistent and I haven't gone to La Azteca to be honest, but with Charanda, I don't need to venture elsewhere. They have a return customer in me. Fair pricing (except the dessert menu didn't have pricing which peeves me, but I was told the churros were $6 which seems super high).   I'll be going back and do recommend it.",

I ordered the chicken tortilla soup with a chicken taco side for a dollar extra while the bf ordered the lunch quesadilla. I have to admit, I could not get through the chicken tortilla soup. My first issue, was the enormous glob of sour cream that was thrown on to my soup making it somewhat inedible. I scooped it out and attempted to eat again. I was sad to find that there were no veggies or beans in my soup, it only consisted of chicken broth, rice, bland shredded chicken, and soggy tortilla strips. 5 minutes in, I gave up, couldn't get past the soggy tortilla chips which was similar in consistency to soggy cereal. Bleh. The taco was also not appetizing.   The server was nice but she wasn't as attentive as she should have been. It took forever to get a water refill. I will not be returning to Charanda in Fort Mill.",

One person says rudely  \"I will help you in a minute\" I just say okay no problem. The guy then starts making two drinks, takes them over to the table, goes to the next table takes their order, then stops at another table to talk to the customers about why his arm is in a sling. He then comes back around the counter and stops and starts drinking a glass of water and talking to the other person standing behind the counter. All this time I'm patiently waiting just to pick up my order that I called in. Then to top that off I get back to work and my order is wrong!!! Never again waste of time and money...",

    "text": "We have been to Charanda Mexican Grill and Cantina on many occasions and we've always had a good experience. When you come in, you're greeted by a smiling face and seated quickly. While waiting for the waiter or waitress, you'll notice the nice Mexican decor with the authentic colors and memorabilia and before you know it, a big bowl of hot salsa chips and your choice of salsa dip. Obviously, the chips are so good that you keep eating and eating them and by the time your food comes, your practically full. You know what I'm talking about.  The wait staff has always been friendly, polite and helpful considering the many times we were indecisive on what we wanted to have. The menu selection is filled with many Authentic Mexican dishes of course and yes if you have a picky eater on your hands then there are alternatives. We've always been pleased with the food, but sometimes there are inconsistencies with the dishes, I assume because there is a different cook. And there have been times we had to send food back several times but it was resolved.   Overall, a decent spot if you're wanting some Mexican food in a hurry, but don't expect to be blown away by the flavor, atmosphere or overall experience. There also is a bar and tvs to keep you occupied while waiting on food.",

I'm a fan. I chose from the lunch menu, the Burrito Texicano. Americanized and with a Tex-Mex sort of vibe to it, the burrito was filled with ground beef and beans, then topped with white queso and crumbled bacon. A nice pile of rice on the side, this was a rather tasty meal and as a lunch portion, pretty good.  Chips were fresh and hot, served with a hot salsa and a more mild version. Both were good.  Good Mexican food, beer specials, I'm definitely a fan!",

My food was pretty good and it seemed like it was a large portion. My friend got the chicken fajitas with corn tortillas. She liked everything about it. The service was not good though. Our server checked on us maybe 1x. We asked for more salsa and no one ever came back. We had to ask for it again and by the time we were done with our food, they brought it out. There wasn't even anyone around for us to ask after we asked the first time.   I will probably check this place out again. Hopefully the service is better.",

Baldie had the beef burrito and taco combo with rice. I ordered steak and cheese with onions in a flour tortilla. Omg, this bitch has the most tender, juicy beef, grilled onions and cheese all melted, oozing and melding together with all the juices from the steak. I'm droolin ova here now!! That came with rice and pico de gallo on lettuce.  I needed some refried beans, man!! All that, plus 2 sweet teas and it cost it's 20 bucks!' Ole, bitches!!",
