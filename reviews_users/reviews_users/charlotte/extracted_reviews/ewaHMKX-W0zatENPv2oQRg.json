You will get a hand pressed half pound burger here, not a frozen thin excuse for a burger that other places give you.  If you don't like what you get tell them, they will make it good, just be nice and honest with them.  They do listen to the customers!

There was only 3 other tables in the entire place and it took over 30 minutes for our 2 sandwiches to make it to our table. The waitress never checked on us or apologized. Once the food came it was underwhelming to say the least. The curly fries were the best thing on my plate. The chicken was dry and the bun was way to large for the chicken that was on it. Next time I get my car serviced I'll visit the Chick-Fil-A instead.",

First thing these ladies should take note on, when a gentleman has a lady with him, don't acknowledge the lady last. You wouldn't like that treatment if the shoes were on the other foot. Our food came and wings were extremely hot (his), shrimp (mine) were cold and she had to return to the kitchen for the fries. They were cold too. Never checked on us again. Finally, as the crowd grew, I asked a server to get the attention of our server and to our unknowingly she was our server. Explain the food is cold and would take it to go now. Final comment she makes is she will stay at the kitchen til the food Is ready like she did the last time. No you didn't or my shrimp and fries would have been HOT as the Chicken. Passive Aggressive. Don't try it.   6/24: Thanks for the update and I will let you know in advance the next time we plan a trip there.",

But this is my favorite.   The ladies are nice, pretty, and cheerful (considering all the guys that must come in trying to run lame game). I always sit at the bar to the right coming in. When I come with the wife we sit at the bar, booths, or tables. When not sitting at the bar I find at times they are a little tardy at taking your order.   As for the food, I've never had any complaints. LEMON PEPPER is my favorite. Naked = Not breaded. I've had their oysters, salads, wings,  fries (curly, which are my favorite), shrimp. Never trusted them with burgers. But some reviews swear by them.    They have a lot of specials, and a updated lunch menu. They run buy 10,get 10 sometimes. All the PPV fights, MMA etc., are at no cover. Can't beat that.   Go Enjoy, TTFN",

My family and I (husband and 2 kids) were seated very promptly which was to be expected because the restaurant was not full and plenty of tables were available. After waiting it took about 10 mins for the waitress to stop at our table to take our drink order. After getting our drinks it took her another 15-20 mins for her to come and take our food order. The next part had to be the most painful. We literally waited 45 mins for our food to come to our table and once it did we received 1 kids meal which the fries were extremely cold and inedible. We also received part of my husbands meal at that time. 15 more minuets go by and the rest of our meal arrives. During this dreadful time a manager did not stop at our table to see how we were doing nor did our waitress explain what was going on or even offer an apology. I've never experienced something like this. This was extremely frustrating and my kids were upset due to the fact that they had to wait an extremely long time to eat. I just wanted bring this to someone's attention. I'm not sure if this is how this establishment runs every Saturday evening !",

    "text": "I took my friend out to lunch at Hooters of South Charlotte since he's never stepped foot inside any Hooters. It's sort of like that classic Madonna song: \"Like A Virgin, touched for the very first time\" This was his very first time being exposed to Hooters.  I've been to Hooters many times when there were several locations throughout Upstate NY and Northern New England (mid 1990s to mid 2000s). This is where I chilled out with my old buddies and we really enjoyed the great tasting wings and things and the crazy hula hoop dances on our birthdays.  Fast forward to 2010! We arrived at Hooters of South Charlotte around high noon on a Friday and the parking lot around the restaurant was almost full, pretty busy. This Hooters has an open and loud sports bar atmosphere with several TVs and plenty of sports/beer related decorations throughout the place. Free wi-fi is offered here. We were seated immediately and my friend could hardly contain his excitement of being inside a Hooters for the first time. For myself, this was merely a reunion with Hooters since all 3 NH locations near my home closed down a few years ago.  Our attractive and friendly waitress promptly arrived at our table to take our drink orders, 2 big Diet Pepsis ($2.49 each) and she suggested we try the Fried Pickles ($4.99), which I said,\"Sure thing!\" The Fried Pickles did not disappoint and tasted pretty good, which were very thin sliced dill pickle chips coated in a crispy breading (not greasy) and served with a creamy and spicy dip.   For lunch, my friend had the Hooters Cobb Salad ($8.99), which was a good sized, \"more than a mouthful\" salad with a mixture of chopped lettuce, bacon, cheese, eggs, tomatoes, fried chicken pieces and dressing cups on the side. I had the 10 Piece Boneless Wings ($7.99) - Samurai (Teriyaki Style), which had a pretty good sweet taste, but were very small chicken nuggets (thick breading) for the price. I was already full from munching down the fried pickles.  The service was very friendly and attentive. The food arrived within 15 minutes and we were given refills on the Diet Pepsi. Overall, we had a pretty decent lunch with a great view. After lunch, I did offer to buy my friend a black Hooters South Charlotte tee as a souvenir, but this location did not have his shirt size Large (L) in stock. There were plenty of XL and 3XL sizes in stock for the big guys.",

It was kind of dead on a Thursday evening, but I have never actually seen this location really busy in the past either.  Anyway, the menu has changed since last time and they offer more selections than before, a good change.  There is now 15 wing sauces to choose from and a wider selection of burger types, salads, and side dishes (like onion rings).  I ordered 20 boneless wings in hot sauce with fries.  The boneless wings were larger than expected, crispy and moist.  The fries, on the other-hand, were okay but needed to be cooked more, half were still soft.  My dad, and the reason we went there, ordered regular wings with no sauce and fries.  His wings are much larger than what they served in years past and were also very good; he didn't eat his fries though because they were not cooked enough (which he did request to be crispy).  Overall, it was a good experience, a definite improvement from past experiences.  However, the prices are still higher than most typical wing places, and there are several good choices nearby that can beat Hooters in both taste and price.",

Bottomline- if you come in with a big group they'll give you the attention you deserve but if you come in solo or just with one other person you'll be disappointed.  Latest experience was coming in on a day they were doing a big nationwide promotion.  I had to actually educate on server that the promotion was going on.  Wings took over a half hour.  Kitchen looked short staffed- which hey it happens, people call out etc.  But the waitress must have passed our table at least a dozen times but no acknowledgement that we existed, asking if we wanted more drinks, update on when our food was coming out etc.  Sure you're busy with other tables but you still have to give everyone you're serving the time of day.  I know the Hooters brand prides itself on having its waitresses provide a certain kind of experience.  I could care less about that and would settle for meeting the basic standards for hospitality. Never had any complaints about the food.  Hooters still does a good wing.  Wish all my tips could go straight to the hard working people in the kitchen.  They're the real superstars of this place. My advice if you're thinking of going here for football seasons- get your order to go!  With the money you'll save on beer and tips you can spring for the Sunday ticket on your own.",

Better locations for Hooters as the other locations that are near us don't really do a great job of preparing or cooking the wings this place every time we go we are never a disappointment wings come out fresh hot juicy and taste great. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great wings atmosphere is always nice and cozy and the upkeep is always great bathrooms look good as well and the wait staff is always nice.",

The waitress did not even apologize for the mistake or inform me that they had to correct my order. I had to ask her was that my food and she said yes but did not tell me st all. So usually for the inconvenience restaurants would at least apologize or something but no they still charged me the full price. Lastly I get the correct food and I ask for my dipping sauce since I have wings the waitress who name is Mercedes said it's in the bag mind you we both checked the food together and there was no dipping sauce in the take out box or bag so I had to wait for that also. PLEASE DO NOT EVER GO TO THIS HOOTERS!!!",

They cannot tell the difference between \"toss lightly\" and \"drizzle\" nor can they tell the difference between \"normal breading\" and \"double breading\". It's wait staff no longer understands the connection between light flirting and good customer service. There no longer seems to be any desire to make the Hooters experience an enjoyable, fun one. I guess the article in the Business Weekly is right: Hooters as we knew it is dead. Today's Hooters is a mere shell of what it once was. And honestly, it should be put out of its misery just as farmers do with old cows that no longer can produce either milk or calves and aren't suitable for selling beef.",

I was offended because I felt like they were being very disrespectful. I don't know if they were trying to be more flirtatious or thought that they was going to get a better tip from the guys. But I think it's wrong that the entire time I was drinking from the same drink. Only reason I was able to get a refill is because my boyfriend gave me his.

Seriously Hooters, can you just train your employees to use common since when asking fo an ID. A blanket policy that you check all ID's is you being lazy in your training program. Well the girl that took my order proceeded to the place she enters orders, tapped a few times on the screen than decided to have a conversation with another girl standing there. After the 3-4 minute conversation she came over to the guy next to me and took his dinner order. Again she went over to the screen to do her tapping.

The service was okay, but the girls at this location have the same low level of enthusiasm as the downtown one. The worst part was the food.  I ordered a side of onion rings.  Half of them were cold.  All of them were DRIPPING with grease and tasted bad.  The wings were similar.  They had a greasy texture to them. I don't know why the Hooters in Charlotte have gone downhill like they have.  While I hope they get their act together and bring them back to what Hooters used to be, I won't hold my breath.  I am planning on visiting the Concord / Speedway Blvd. location to see if they have tanked like these two locations.  For now, avoid them.",

    "text": "My husband is a craft beer enthusiast and he ordered a local IPA he frequently enjoys:  NoDa Brewery's Hop Drop & Roll. The first beer they brought him was correct, but when they brought the second beer out, it was clearly a Miller Lite. The server told us the bartender accidentally poured the wrong beer the first time, but THIS was the correct beer. My husband told her no, the first one was correct, this one is not. But not wishing to be an inconvenience, he took the Miller Lite and drank it anyway. When he finished it, he went straight to the bartender for his next drink as he wanted to interact with her personally and ensure he got the beer he wanted.   After first refusing to serve him -- apparently if you have a waitress you can't order at the bar? -- the bartender insisted she poured the incorrect beer the first time, and the second beer she sent out was the correct one (the Hop Drop). My husband drinks this beer all the time, and he knows the difference between that and a domestic light beer. He tried explaining this, but she refused to hear it and continued to argue with him that he was the one mistaken, not her. When he pointed out that the beer she was trying to give him wasn't even the right color, she changed her tune, saying \"Oh, we only carry the light Hop Drop, not the regular.\"  We are big enthusiasts of the brewery that produces this beer -- they do not make a \"light\" Hop Drop IPA.  He was absolutely 100% certain he was being served Miller Lite (he also drinks this beer regularly so he knows what he's talking about).  At one point, our server said she would go talk with the manager to straighten it out and see if perhaps something was wrong with the taps, or if there was an issue on the bartender's end. As soon as she left our table, she went and sat at a table with a bunch of other waitresses and never went to get the manager. My husband attempted to get her attention a few times, and his attempts were ignored.   To add insult to injury, we were still charged for two Hop Drop IPAs, which are quite a bit more expensive than a regular domestic.  Even after the bartender claimed she served us a $5 beer the first time, we were still charged for two $8 beers.   It seems insignificant, not really a big deal, but after a very long day at work we were looking forward to hanging out and enjoying a few good beers.  We can't figure out what the big issue was with this particular beer. And in general, it's poor form to argue with a customer when you're in the wrong.  If a customer is insisting you're giving them the wrong product, even if you think you're right, shouldn't you check into it and see if a tap might be hooked up to the wrong keg or something?  Just my thoughts. We won't be returning to this Hooters again regardless.  The food tasted fine but I can find good food at plenty of other places with better service.",

We ended up with one medium regular and one medium breaded, which is not a major problem.  Packed nicely, a good mix of wings and legs, they had the little pot of blue  cheese. Tasty and greasy like wings are supposed to be. Decent flavor and enjoyable. An A-OK experience from Hooters.  [Review 10476 overall, 243 of 2019.]",

Kinda wish they would upgrade this location, looks drab and dark...dated. Also tables need to be cleaned soon as folks leave. A lot of the girls are just sitting around instead of sprucing up. Idk maybe that's not in their job description but someone needs to make sure it is. Anyway my server Jade was great, very polite, funny and friendly.",

    "text": "So I must say I'm not big on hooters. Just average bar food with a great concept. Today however, I had no choice because I was going to the movies and there are absolutely no food options in this area... Well there a couple (Chik Fila A, Popeye's) but none of them have drinks so Hooters was the victor!  I'm all about craft beer and they had a great Indian pale ale (only one on the menu, try it!). After that I got the strawberry margarita. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. It was amazing. I'll definitely get that drink again.  I was only there for drinks but I can always go for some fried pickles. That was the gateway to the thing that changed my life...Garlic Habanero smoked wings! Wowsers! I love trying unique Wing flavors and that's definitely one I hadn't seen before. It was so good that hotters has now officially made it my 2018 NFL Sunday football restaurants. Gotta come back for those.",

    "text": "Every Hooters you go to will be very different in service, and with how the food tastes so try several to get a general idea of what Hooters has to offer.  On this day my family and I went to the South Boulevard location for a good meal.  I was in the mood for comfort food and ordered a plate of the Chili Cheese Fries, a side of Broccoli with a Sweet Tea.    Location: Easily accessible and there was a parking spot for us although it was a busy night.  When we walked in we were seated right away and noticed most tables were full.  Service: LaLa came out greeted us and took our order.  She was nice and attentive making sure that she heard all of the special ways each person wanted their food.  LaLa did her best to get everything right which takes time.  Food: My food was served hot and was seasoned well.  I very much enjoyed the Chili Cheese Fries and the Sweet Tea.  The broccoli however was to-die-for AMAZING.  Now you wonder how that is possible. . . well it was washed clean, with no sandy grit and it was cooked properly.  It was soft and buttery and flavorful.  I will get the side of broccoli every time that I go.    We were given just the right amount of time to eat and did not feel rushed.  I went to the women's rest room and noticed that it could use a makeover.  It is not the worst I have seen but it also is not the best.  I would use the restroom again but would hope that it gets a little more love and care this year.",

I like some of the management, but a disgusting facility is a disguting facility. Maybe it's time for a Hooters corporate management intervention! If you don't put money in to a facility, why should patrons car about supporting your business?",

That was solely a mistake we made. We ordered a Buffalo Chicken Salad to split and when it arrived, we could tell the chicken was light in color. Something told us to split up the chicken before we took a bite and all the pieces were raw in the middle. The manager never came over to apologize for inconvenience! Please kitchen crew make sure your chicken is cooked all the way before sending it out.",
