Don't get me wrong, it's still light years better than many places, but it just isn't the same anymore. Kinda like Ladainian Tomlinson.  This location is clean, modern and nicely decorated.  If you haven't been, Red Bowl is a fusion gourmet style asian restaurant. Prices are a couple bucks cheaper than PF Changs but preparation here is a little more traditional.   Since it's fusion, you can get everything from Generals Tso's, to Thai Basil Chicken, to Sushi and even Singaporean noodles.  Red Bowl is still good, it just isn't great anymore. But their $5 lunch specials with tea, now that's greatness.",

Additionally, sushi is offered at a special price ($3.99) on Wednesdays! The dining area is warm, cozy, and offers a nice environment to conversate with friends and loved ones. I really enjoy eating here and always ask for Krystal as my waitress. She is overly eager to please and my tips always reflect her service. The only drawback about this place is that it can get busy and you may wait a few moments longer to be seated at times. Other than that, excellent bistro!",

The bento boxes are such a great deal and the food is delicious! Very flavorful and healthy portions. Try the egg drop soup, it's perfect! I always leave stuffed and have never been disappointed.

When I got home I realized my mongolian beef didnt even LOOK like it did when I dined in. Not saucy and it didnt have as much flavor. My mom said that her curry shrimp was normally not as runny as it was either.

The quality has been up and down over that period of time but mostly wavered between 3 and 4 stars with a brief, early foray into 5 star territory.  I have not written a review, mostly because I thought I had already reviewed them which turns out not to be the case.  A couple of less than stellar meals recently have made me put pen to paper, or finger to laptop key in this case to give my opinion of this long-lived Westside restaurant.  I remember when this space was a hardware store, so I have a long history here but I will limit my comments to the most recent visit.  My wife and I ordered takeout from Red Bowl for dinner and the ladies at the front desk were efficient, and very nice as always.  They have never messed up our order and are always very close in the estimated time for the food to be ready.  Aside from one \"creepy\" waiter, all the staff are usually nice when I have sat in the dining room.  The food...We got potstickers which were limp, not fried, and cool to the touch.  The dipping sauce was right out of the fridge cold.  The eggroll was cool, not fried nearly enough, limp, and worst of all tasted like old grease.  Hot and sour soup was a hit, great balance, hot and spicy with lots of goodies.  House Lo Mein had a good flavor and was hot but the noodles were too soft, and the shrimp was way overcooked.  Beef and broccoli was about as good as you get at the average buffet, beef was tender and flavorful but too much sauce and very salty.  I hate to see this place go down hill but with the great number of good Chinese restaurants in this city, I refuse to go down hill with them.",

I asked if I could get the sushi roll deep fried and the girl says no but you can get it deep fried if its not in the bento box. The difference is we have to send it from the sushi bar back to the chef. Um...wouldn't you need to send both back to the chef?  So she goes to check on it with another waitress comes back and says yes you can do that on the bento box but it costs $1 extra. REALLY?!?!?  What logic is that???

This was our first trip here and seems like a decent lunch stop if you're planning on getting groceries at Harris Teeter or the Walmart and don't want to shop on an empty stomach.   Their menu had plenty of choices that peaked our interest, but i'm guessing the $5 General Tso's is next on my list.

Also, don't order an expensive bottle of wine. We did, and it tasted like vinegar. The manager would not provide us with a different bottle so it just sat there full. I've asked to return a bottle of wine perhaps twice in my entire lifetime, so I don't make a habit of doing so. Was very disappointed with the response we got that night.",

Also, they're in the area so convenience can trump the medium quality meals. I'm glad they're here!",

I checked in and paid and was told it would be a couple more minutes.  10 more minutes went by and I asked again what was taking so long.  The girls looked at each other and then went back to the kitchen.  At the 15 minute mark the girls came back up and were talking to each other.  I could tell by their body language something was off.  I asked them, did you give my food away to someone else?  They looked at each other and said they didn't know.  I then asked for a manger.  John came up and I pulled him aside out of ear shot of anyone else and explained my disappointment.  I asked him to knock off half my bill due to my food being given away and he reluctantly comped my entire order.  I was so happy!  He said it would take about 15 minutes.  He credited back my $40 bill and then came back 5 minutes later asking if I wanted some water or a beer.  I said a beer would be great.  John was amazing.  He is what all managers should strive to be.  Standing up when a restaurant messes up and fixing the relationship!  I was so happy with how John treated me.  I will never hesitate to come back to Red Bowl.  When and if they mess up, they will admit it, and fix it.  Thank you so much John, the food was amazing!",

Our waiter made up for the poor first impression. He was prompt and funny and made some good recommendations. We both went with the Bento Box which offers your choice of soup or salad, sushi roll, entree and fried or steamed rice.   I went with the Hot and Sour soup. It had all the flavors I was expecting and the crispy wontons added a nice touch. For my sushi roll, I opted for the Spicy Tuna Roll. It was classic. But it didn't knock my socks off.  Finally for the entree I went with the Spicy Mango Shrimp with steamed rice. The shrimp were large and the mango sauce was good.   This place isn't bad my any means, I just wasn't overly impressed. I may give them another chance if I'm in the area, but I'm not rushing back.",

I must say, I thought it would be the no-atmosphere fast food Chinese restaurant since it sits in a strip mall next to Harris Teeter in Mountain Island Lake. You would probably only go there if you lived in that area or were stocking up at the nearby Walmart. YOU WILL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! The restaurant is bigger than expected with a two tiered dining room.  Both times the servers were nice and attentive to our needs. As for the menu- there was no lemon chicken. I thought that was a staple on a Chinese food menu. Who doesn't like lemon chicken?? I got the sesame chicken instead and it was a little over cooked, which was disappointing. The second time I got the hibachi steak which was excellent.  This place has specials during the week like $4 cocktails and other sushi specials which I always appreciate. I have seen a coupon in the Valpak that comes in the mail for half off an entree which is always a plus.",

For $11.50  you get a salad or spring roll, choice of sushi and then an entree with fried, white or steamed rice.  I had the salad with ginger, crunchy roll sushi, hibachi chicken with fried rice, We also had a pot of Jasmine tea, It was all quite good and the service was very good, Eddy is professional and has an easy manner.

No need to dip a lot or its overpowering, it should be sweeter. -Sushi is normal, not bad at all.  That's about it... I'll probably come back to try other dishes --- any recommendations?",

There was nothing glaringly gross or unhygenic at Red Bowl near Callabridge but I feel the restaurant definitely could've used a though wipe down of it's surfaces. Pushing that out of my mind and automatically deducting one star off my review, I pressed forward with my meal. Our server (Tara, a lovely young lady) was prompt with our food and drink orders and the atmosphere was relaxing and uncomplicated. I ordered the Bento box, a relatively popular order from what I can surmise, which came with your choice of soup, 6 rolls, an entree, and a styling of rice for 11.95. The food itself was pretty unremarkable. I enjoyed my meal but wasn't blown away/didn't taste anything that would entice me to return.   Red Bowl is deserving of the three star average it currently maintains. Nothing special; the word mediocre comes to mind but I feel that may have a more harsh connotation for most people than it does for me. It's...ok",

The meat: chicken and beef in the house lo mein and house fried rice taste \"weird\"   Besides the sushi here, I do not like the meat. Service sucks because they have maybe 2 waitresses tried to care for 20+ tables and it's not working. I love close by but it's time to find a new restaurant.

Waitress came and took our drink order which took forever to get. When taking our food order I wanted sweet n sour chicken and was advised they didnt have sweet n sour chicken today. Not sure why because harris teeter is right beside it and if they was out of something could have went there and got what they needed but i settled for seasame chicken. My wife ordered beef n broccoli and 2 spring rolls and I had an egg roll. The egg roll tasted like it had been sitting most of the day and was barely warm. When our food came out it was just as awful. The fried rice wasnt good and was like it had been sitting a while. Seasame chicken had a funking taste to it and wasnt that good as well. We had to ask another waitress for our bill to leave because our waitress was missing. When our waitress did take our bill i asked for a coke to go and that never came either. Needless to say today killed it for us going back to this Red Bowl!!!",

Red Bowl is arguably one of the best places for Asian cuisine in this area of Charlotte. Whether you're dining in or taking out, Red Bowl's food has not done me wrong. Also, it's the best option for Asian style food in this area - period.   All the stir fry's are good. They have a full bar with TVs so you can hang out as well. You can dine in or take out. The menu is pretty extensive. I'm talking chicken, seafood, beef, vegetarian .... sushi, fried stuff, lo Meins, fried rice - soo much on the menu. The crab wontons are DELICIOUS in my opinion and the best starter they have on the menu. The staff is generally friendly and accommodating. Portions are pretty big as well. It's a little rough around the edges, nothing fancy & service isn't always consistent. However, one thing is consistent - THE FOOD. Whoever is in the kitchen can COOK.    I would recommend to a friend for sure.",

We were surprised how lard the bistro was, from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall but it's large enough for families of all sizes and has a cute bar area up front.   Priced right, the menu has lots of options. We decided on crab Rangoon's to start. They came out very hot (always good) and had lots of crab flavor in just a small bundle of filling. The sweet and sour was tasty with a nice pineapple flavor in there. The opportunity here would be just to plate them on a paper of some sort or even just some chopped cabbage, the plate had the oil which isn't a surprise since they are deep fried.   The entrees we shared were beef lo mein and Mongolian beef. Both had that awesome wok flavor I'm looking for with Chinese food. The lo mein could have used some more veggies for some color and texture. It had a nice flavor of garlic and savory all the way through. The Mongolian beef was also good with a hint of sweet in the dish. The dishes were a little heavy with oil but it's normal for most Chinese food. The chile oil was not spicy to us... which was a little sad.   The service was attentive and they worked as a team so that helped keep things moving.",

Everything from the food, industrial style interior design, to the staff makes this place an enjoyable eatery. Not to mention the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are served.  Great seating with plenty of room.   When wanting some of your favorite Asian dishes this is a place to dine!",

Always! I must come here two or three times a month. The food is always hot and fresh. I love the chicken egg rolls. Pad Tai is one of my favorite dishes. The Drunken Noodles is a must try. The Singapore Rice Noodles is another fav. The service is probably the weakest link. There are a few amazing servers, but they are few and far between. What a gem for this part of Charlotte that desperately needs better/more restaurants.",

    "text": "Just tried this place for the first time last night and it was a hit and miss with their food. I got the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls and the Chicken Red Bowl StirFry w/Teriyaki Sauce.   The Chicken StirFry was delicious. I was looking for something healthy and it was just that: chicken and a bunch of vegetables in a light sauce. The sauce could have been slightly thicker to coat the meat, but it was it was still good. The downside: it was listed for a cheaper price on the online menu than what I was charged. Also, when I finished my bowl I found some fine black grit at the bottom. Hopefully, it all settled to the bottom and I didn't eat any of it .  On a negative note, the Summer Rolls were extremely disappointing and flavorless. It was just a few thin pieces of shrimp and a lot of lettuce. No noodles, sprouts, vegetables, or herbs. If they were present, it was in extremely small quantities and the roll was completely reliant on the peanut dipping sauce (which was ok) to give it taste.   I will say I didn't dine in, but it was well lit, I liked the ambiance, and the staff I interacted with was friendly. Because a lot of the reviews on here were positive ones, I'm willing to give this place another shot and see how other menu items stack up against the Asian food I'm used to having in CA.",

I got the chicken hibachi with a chicken egg roll. The egg roll was mediocre, but crispy and not too hot. The hibachi was huge! Good quality meat, and I like that it had a bit of a sauce and wasn't dry and boring like other places. Chicken tasted like chicken...lol. Sadly had to say that due to so many Chinese places in town with offputting textured/colored meat. Veggies were cooked well and retained a nice crunch. A colorful and flavorful meal.   Nice place to go out with friends, take a date, or bring family. Good prices, and as another user said, it is larger than it looks outside.",

The staff here are friendly as ever, they know my boyfriend John by his name every time he comes in because he was definitely a regular when he lived closer to the location. I always for the most part order the flour chicken and rice. Not your average flour chicken ,it's drenched in a brown wine sauce that taste oh so divine. I never was very fond of Asian food until I started eating here years ago. One of the best!",

It is located in a shopping center so parking was plentiful.  We were seated rather quickly for a Monday early evening.  That's about where is goes downhill.  Our server was nice enough but the menu unfortunately looks like every other Asian menu.  I had the broccoli and shrimp stir fry.  I don't have anything negative to say, but I wasn't impressed either.  This was  a drive by so it met the intent.  The folks left with full bellies.",

In about 15 minutes my soup was delivered and in another 15 minutes my salad, then it took about 10 minutes for my wife to get hers......we had two kids and they had to get some of my noodles as they were anxious and hungry too.....  Then... about 15 after the above 2 other adults got their plates however one was wrong and had to be corrected..... now about 45 minutes after order placed, the last two adults got their and one child..... by this time most had eaten some to keep from the food getting cold.
