Our waitress was very nice but she was overwhelmed as they were clearly understaffed...and it was only half full. The food not very good. I had the shrimp scampi and it was bland and he pasta was over cooked.  My wife had a salad and it was essentially lettuce on a plate.  I expected more from a restaurant like this. My two stars are for the waitress who was very nice and was doing everything she could to keep up.",

I was looking for some place that was cozy, quiet and would allow us to meet and get to know each other comfortably. For once, I got exactly what I wanted and I have to say that the atmosphere helped to set a great mood for such a nice night. The waiter was knowledgeable and very helpful. Polite and professional! He made us feel right at home. And the food was incredible. Exactly as he described so there was no surprises. The flavor was exquisite and the portion was large enough to justify the price. I was quite satisfied and looking forward to another night out at Mickey & Mooch's again soon.",

Is that this place seems to be always under staffed.  That's how you know that the food is really good.  Because I have a low tolerance for slow service  I know that this restaurant is a steak place.... But I dont consider their steaks as being cream of the crop, and neither does my fellow yelpers.

This did not disappoint me. It was great. We had a party of four, all of us ordered off the Restaurant weeks menu. Two of the party had the Charleston Crab soup, it was delicate but full of crab and delicious, and a very large bowl. One of my party had the Wedge salad which I have had before and they are known for--it was fantastic! I ordered the Filet of Beef with Blue Cheese fondue---Melted in my mouth!! Could have ordered two plates of it!! For my Entree i  had the Cold Water Lobster tail, they were two smaller ones cut in half but wonderfully fresh and tasty. My husband had the Rack of Ribs, smokey and falling off the bone! My friends had the Lamb Chops which looked incredible and the other woman had The Crab Cakes, she loves to order them all over and said these were some of the best!  Desserts were very special, I had the Italian Almond Creme cake..like a Tiramisu with Amaretto instead of coffee and brandy ..It was like a cloud! My husband had the Creme Brulee which was very good.  We left feeling very satisfied to find out that it was still a great choice and a place to remember to come ...----more often!!",

I have to say that the service has been really hit or miss on our visits.     The atmosphere is nice - sort of upscale without being too stuffy.  They have a piano in the bar area and on most visits, they had someone playing, which is a nice touch.   On our most recent visit, David and I met a friend for dinner and we had a really nice server who was very attentive.  She didn't know much about the wine menu, but that seems to be fairly common in our experience these days. (Still, we find it  very disappointing in a place that bills itself as an \"upscale restuarant\"!)  The food was fairly good but a little on the pricey side.     While this is not my first choice when we are planning a night out, I can usually find something I like on the menu - they usually have at least one or 2 fish entrees for the non-meat eaters like myself.      David said that he prefers the Mickey & Mooch up at LKN - he thinks that the food & service is better there.  I haven't eaten at the Lake Norman location though, so I can't compare the two.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to try Mickey and Mooch tonight as our date night spot since they were participating in the Queen's Fest.  I made a 7:00 PM reservation for two.  We arrived at 6:50 PM and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was Chong and he was awesome!  He was extremely personable and knowledgeable.    I was born and raised in Charleston, SC so I wanted to try the Charleston Crab Soup.  It had a slight twist on the traditional She-Crab Soup, but delicious nonetheless.  My husband ordered the baby back ribs with mashed potatoes.  I ordered the jumbo scallops blackened with Cajun cream sauce with the Charleston grits (notice a theme here?).  Our meals were outstanding.  We couldn't finish everything and took home leftovers, including dessert.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because of the seating arrangement.  The restaurant has a combination of tables, booths, and booths/chairs combo tables.  We were seated at one of these combo-type tables and the dining parties are pretty close together.  The party of three adults next to us were incredibly loud.  They made it difficult for my husband and I to carry on our own conversation because we could barley hear each other because they were so boisterous.  Now, we know why the party that checked in ahead of us made a special request in their reservation for a table and not a booth (we overheard the hostess confirming this with them before taking them to their table).  After reading through the reviews, we were a little nervous about going but glad we gave it a try.  We would definitely go back.",

The decor is a little heavy and shopworn. Clientele is mostly 55+ and I get the impression that the menu hasn't changed in the last 20 years.  Food is OK - we had steaks, tuna and salmon and from the looks of the sauce, I suspect that the entrees all got started at the same time and then the fish sat while the steak finished cooking.  Overpriced for what you get and the service, while OK, is not outstanding.",

    "text": "I ate at Mickey and Mooch for my college grad dinner 7 years ago and have been in love ever since, for anniversaries,  date nights, business dinners, whatever the reason I can get there!  Hailing from the Baltimore area - I have the authority to say their lump crab appetizer or dinner is the best crab plate you can get.  You get a plate that is piled high with a hefty chunk of crab for a dang good price - order the same thing at Ruth Chris and you get 1/5th of crab for 4 dollars more.  Crab cakes are still done better in Maryland though!  Wine by the glass is a deal!  Order a chardonnay at Sulivans - 14 dollars, half glass.  Same glass of wine here - 8 dollars and filled to the brim.    Cesar salads here are done perfect - I pushed my wedge out of the way to pick at my wife's Cesar last night.  To enjoy this place you will need to order a Prime Filet, medium rare.  For a fraction of the price you get a steak as good as Ruth Chris, just not covered in butter (not a bad thing).  They cook medium rare pretty well, and the prime is tender and butter textured  You want the best desert - 7 layer chocolate cake.  The full slice is enough to make you gain 3-lbs.  My wife and I weighed a full slice - it's almost 3-lbs!  They do offer it in the half slice - which weights just under 2!    Service is normally good, but that is definitely the difference between a Del Frisco's or Morton's, the waiters at Mickey and Mooch are not the caliber that you get at the higher priced steak houses, but I come for the food!",

I always enjoyed eating at Mickey & Mooches and we've eaten there for years with great service & great food. Not last night!  Service was horrific i.e.: 30 min to get a refill on a drink. Our food wasn't cooked properly and our sides didn't come out until mid way thru our meal & that took over an hour to get. While I was in the restroom, my husband asked to see the manager and a bouncer looking dude came out and said he was \"Mickey\". Mickey said our waitress was overworked, and it was her fault for not telling him, and the kitchen was too busy. Then Mickey said that he was the cook & the owner and that it was our prerogative to eat there and like it or get the \"f\" out. At this point, my husband basically told Mickey to screw himself. Then Mickey told my freaked out 14 yr old daughter that she had 2 min to get my husband outta there or he was calling the cops. This is when I come back to the table. Now I assure you that my husband had some cross words with Mickey, but seriously?!  How dare that Mickey jerk bully my teenage daughter around!  I swear I'm not making this craziness up. I politely & calmly asked Mickey to bring us the check so we could pay and he rolled his eyes at me and stomped off!  I asked the hostess to please get our check because we are not accustomed to dine & dash. We paid, left the crying waitress a 20% tip and we went home with 2 crying girls. I've had \"off\" nights at great restaurants before, but I have never experienced anything like last night. Pigs will fly or that restaurant gets new management b4 I eat there again!!  Please share this story. This restaurant does not deserve anyone's business.",

We had a reservation and were seated immediately in an almost empty restaurant. We were seated in the middle where it appeared they were trying to add more seating to the place as it was cramped. I asked if we could be seated along the outside of the restaurant and were told \"no, those tables are reserved.\"  They may have been but I can tell you that when we left two hours later, there was still no one at those tables and most were seated in the middle where you basically have to ask the table behind you if you need to back up your chair.  The host seemed arrogant and while Mickey and Mooch is nice, it's not nice enough for the uppity attitude. Too many nice places in Charlotte, may not be back to this one for a while. Two years ago, it was my favorite place to eat if that says anything.",

For the price we paid we could have gone to a high-end steakhouse, like Ruths Chris, but we tried Mickey and we were very disappointed.  The shrimp was rubbery, the steak was over-cooked from the way it was ordered, the family style grits tasted barely better than instant grits, and everybody I know can make better mashed potatoes.  To top it all off we felt sick for 24 hrs after eating.  The one bright spot was that the dessert was better than average (though not premium).  Extremely disappointed for a $100 meal for 2.

    "text": "Decided to go here for our anniversary tonight. Arrived to an empty host/hostess stand despite a good sized crowd. Because we had reservations we were seated after a minute or so.   We sat at our table for a few minutes before being greeted by our waitress who then took a few more minutes to bring back water. Ok, they're busy. I get it. I ordered the shrimp & grits and my lady ordered the marinated chicken breast. We both got the one side as a salad, which was a decent house salad.   Now the main course is brought out. My shrimp & grits are admittedly pretty darn good. My lady comments how good the chicken is -- very good sauce and moist. Between the conversation we're holding we each have a few bites of our respective meals and then she stops with a frightened look on her face -- it's raw. I was shocked to find that she was not even close to exaggerating. Worse yet, she had eaten a few bites already. After sitting there for a few minutes hoping our waitress would check on us, we finally get her attention and she notices the raw chicken and offers to have it cooked longer. The appetite was long gone by that point and there was no way we were going to give the cook another chance to botch this.   Our waitress said she'd remove that from the check and unapologetically, after quite some time, she did; however, that salad that came with the meal was now a charge on the final bill along with my salad and shrimp and grits.   Not once did she seem concerned about my lady. Not once did a manager come over to talk to us. Somehow, out of pure habit I suppose, I even left her a tip!  I'm a pretty laid back guy, but this experience has me so upset how little care they show to their guests and that they can serve chicken of all meats highly undercooked.   I'm hoping this review shows many people how poor service sounds and gives you second thoughts when considering spending your hard earned money here.  This place really did deserve ZERO Stars tonight!!!",

Every once in a while I get a craving for a yummy filet and baked potato and this place hits the spot without costing a fortune! The steak with 2 sides is around $25 - and no, this is not outback-quality steak. They have the highest grade beef as an option, but I was happy enough with the \"regular\" version (sorry I don't have my beef grades memorized). Also - the wedge salad is delish!  The service has also been great both times. We had reservations & were seated right away  Our waitress was attentive...in fact, all the servers are attentive to all the tables. They seem to float to each other's tables (and have food runners), which makes it very efficient overall.   Wine options are really affordable...if my memory is correct the Pinot Noir I got was $5.50 for an 8 ounce pour - that's really big! So another bonus!  The bar looked really hopping - we were there on the early side, but there was a piano and live music later.   I do wish it was more scenic outside than the Arboretum, but the inside is still nice!",

Whoever is in the kitchen is moonlighting as a chef from there day job scraping road kill. My experience was so horrifyingly bad I had the unfortunate and dubious pleasure of meeting the owner. He looked down his nose at me, frowning at my feedback, chomping at the bit while I was talking for his chance to tell me how successful his restaurant has been all these years. We didn't even complain! We had already handed over the money for this absurd excuse for a dinning experience and were walking out the door when he told us to have a nice night; skirting the customary inquiry about our experience. I couldn't resist not dishing to the man only to find the root of the establishment's insidious disfunction.   Nearby alternatives with similar service standards and food quality with a cheaper menu: Chilis, Taco Bell, Walmart (they have a candy isle)",

After receiving a confirmation, I thought everything was ok. When I went back to check, there was an error.

    "text": "My family had a dinner celebration here for my grandmother's 85th birthday. We had the whole back room reserved for ourselves. It was definitely nice to be set apart from the rest of the restaurant so we could party in privacy. The servers, although very few for the several guests we had, were doing their best to take care of us. Polite and friendly, but obviously rushing about.   The dinner was buffet style with options of the chicken marsala, NY strip steak, shrimp and broccoli alfredo, plus side salad, green beans, mashed potatoes, and other veggie sides. Unfortunately, I was the last table to be called up, and by the time I got to the food, there was practically nothing left. They were out of chicken and steak. They already brought out all the steak, so there would be no more of that. Womp. Then they kept saying \"2 minutes\" for the chicken. A set of ten 2minutes ticked by before getting more chicken. I suppose the fault of not ordering enough steak lies on my family, but I don't think guests should have been waiting for refills to come out. That should have been planned better.  I ended up only grabbing some pasta, green beans, and mashed potatoes. All were pretty good, but I could have also been really hungry. They ran out of salads at the buffet table too (sheesh), and so I had to ask a server for one to fill me up more. He said they weren't bringing any more out, but he gave me one anyway. The dressing I picked was weird, though. I assumed it was a Thousand Island by the color, but it had chunks of blue cheese in it. Weird, especially because right next to it was another container for what I assumed was actual Blue Cheese dressing. Serving blue cheese and blue cheese? Huh.  Desserts came out and saved my meal. The chocolate cake was delicious!",

    "text": "Meh is the perfect word for this place.  Based on how empty the dining room was on Sunday, I think many have also come to the same conclusion.    Service: While our server was nice, the service was poor.  It started with waiting for 10 minutes until being asked if anyone had gotten to us yet.  From there, we ordered our appetizer and drinks (2 glasses of wine and a beer) at the same time.  The appetizer came out 5 minutes before our drinks.  When the drinks did arrive we placed our dinner order, which they got one of the 3 wrong.  Now while this happens and not that big of a deal, the server told me he did not even realize they had a Shrimp Carbonara on the menu and that's why I was given a Chicken Carbonara.  Food:  We ordered the special king crab Appetizer and it was almost void of flavor.  The texture also made us think it was not very fresh.  For the entrees, the Chicken Carbonara was ok.  The Shrimp Carbonara and Shrimp Scampi both had shrimp that was void of flavor.  So I am thinking they need to find a new seafood vendor.  We ordered a carrot cake to go.  It was good but my thinking is that's made somewhere else.  Atmosphere: This was ok.  The place was empty so it was quiet and with the delays in service we had plenty of time to chat.  The vinyl white tablecloths felt like a cost cutting measure and not what you expect from a $$$ place.    Overall, it's not a place I would suggest for the price or what you think the experience should or would be.  It's just meh.",

First, even though we had a 7pm reservation, we weren't seated until 7:35pm, and the hostess seemed disorganized rather than helpful. Our waiter was inexperienced, perhaps new, and not very attentive (had to ask for water refills, more bread, etc.), and perhaps had too many tables to service. I had my favorites, bone-in ribeye, blue cheese cole slaw, and a shrimp cocktail.Others had grits with filet and fries. The food was good, but not as good as I recall it being. The fries were oily and the shrimp could have been cleaned better. We decided to skip dessert and go to Amalie's instead, even though the chocolate cake is also a favorite of mine. All in all, a disappointing experience, certainly not up to previous visits, and we will probably go elsewhere in the future. Too bad.",

    "text": "I recently had a business dinner at Mickey & Mooch, dubbed \"The Best Steakhouse in the Area\" by US Air Magazine (a questionably reputable source). I figured it was a good opportunity to try the place without spending my own money.   First, the restaurant is in a strip mall. I took a second to let that thought pass and walked in to a warm and inviting atmosphere. Nothing overly unique, it felt like a typical, higher end steakhouse.   We ordered a few bottles of nice Cabernet for the table from their adequate but pricey wine list. The waiter brought out wine glasses for the table. Half were appropriate, nice red wine glasses. The other half were a utilitarian wine glass you would find when ordering wine at Applebee's. When asked about the different glasses, the waiter indicated they \"ran out\" of the nicer, red wine glasses. It was 7:00 on a Wednesday night with a HALF FULL restaurant and you are telling me you are out of red wine glasses? I found that a bit tacky and watching them pour the Frog Leap Cabernet into these glasses pained me a little.   Our table ordered the Coconut Shrimp and Shrimp cocktail for appetizers. The Shrimp in the cocktail were WAY overcooked and seemed like the precooked grocery store shrimp defrosted and put on a plate. Coconut shrimp were fine, but nothing special.   I had the wedge salad that I was not impressed by at all. For dinner I ordered the \"USDA Prime\" Fillet, cooked Pittsburgh Medium-rare. Any good steakhouse should have no issue getting this order right. It came out medium rare, but had bearnaise sauce all over it, which I did not order. The steak itself was ok, but certainly not up to \"USDA Prime\" standards.   The green beans I had with the steak were overcooked and still had some of the stalk on a few. I guess it may have been an indicator that they were not frozen because even Bird's Eye knows to take all the stalks off. The crab cake I had on the side was pretty good.   For dessert, we all shared a few slices of their 7 layer carrot cake. This had to be the largest slice of carrot cake I have ever seen. The cake was a little try, but not too bad. I heard the 7 layer chocolate cake is to die for, but didn't get to sample. Either will be huge and a challenge for 4 to finish.   Pros: Atmosphere, Good Service (minus the wine glass mishap), dessert   Cons: Uninspired, poorly cooked entrees and appetizers, overpriced for the quality, inadequate wine glasses.",

    "text": "Wow! Mickey and Mooch blew me away, great atmosphere, decent service, and absolutely amazing food. I ordered the Low country Crispy Flounder topped with Lump Crab Meat Remoulade....fantastic.  The flounder is fried in a light batter,just enough to give it a nice crunch, it's not greasy, but has just enough oil to make it really, really tasty. Flavored to perfection,the meat is so light and flaky, it's a pleasure to eat, without any of the guilt of chowing down on red meat.  You wouldn't even think about putting tartar sauce on this flounder, its just too good.  And then unexpectedly you will get a piece of the lump crab meat in with the flounder, and oh baby...the taste, its worth the drive to the Arboretum. As I drooled over my light yet tantalizing flounder, my attention was turned to the mashed potatoes which were taking up an inordinate amount of space on my plate, I'm talking about huge portions here.  And these potatoes were out of this world...simply delicious, with subtle butter and salt flavors, but not so much that it masked the natural fresh taste of the potatoes. And the best part is I experienced all of this decadent flavor for the very economic price of $15.95 at dinner, and that includes the salad.  My brother, it was his birthday celebration..Happy Birthday Matty! ordered the Charleston Shrimp and Grits, I only managed to scrounge a bite, but it was pretty good, and being a Chapel Hill boy I don't approve of just any bowl of grits with shrimp...but these were good, and once again the portions were mammoth...Matt also ordered a side of Mashed potatoes, and they brought him a heaping BOWL of potatoes...I don't know if it was because it was his birthday or what, but...... man.   Mickey and Mooch; great atmosphere, reasonable prices, and great food.  The entire restaurant has an elite vibe, without the snobbery.  Eat at this Place!",

Being someone who had worked in Food service for over 10 years, It hurt my heart to see the executive chef acting as a hostess and server.",

It took the waiter 35 minutes to inform us one drink we ordered was not available! It then took us 30 minutes to get checks.  When one of us asked to speak with a manager, a chef was sent out and said he would check on our checks. He offered no apology.  All left angry and disgusted. Granted it was Charlotte Restaurant Week and our party requested eight separate checks, but Mickey & Mooch blew this opportunity to impress nine women who live within five minutes of the restaurant. They need to staff up for these promotional events. Perhaps we caught a rooky waiter, but Eric K's review below indicates a very similar experience, including the sloshed drinks. A reminder to restaurants using Groupon or celebrating Charlotte Restaurant Week - Get you game on man! Otherwise, you are actually using your marketing dollars to hurt your reputation...",

Our server Chad was attentive, and the other servers who helped expedite the meal and drinks were also attentive. The meals we all had were cooked very well. I personally had the crab soup, strip steak, blue cheese coleslaw and almond amaretto cake. All tasted really good. Others in my party had  the burger, pasta, and steaks. Everyone was happy with their meals. My Cosmo was also delivered carefully. I was surprised to have Mickey come to our table after I told the server how much I liked the crab soup. Mickey sent some soup home with me, and I cannot tell you how nice it was to experience that level of personal service! The soup is still great, day two. The atmosphere, decor, food, and service were all well worth it. We will absolutely return. Thanks for a great dinner.",

We arrived 15 minutes early and our table wasn't ready (certainly understandable). We were told that they give patrons 2 hours to complete their meal, so our table must have been reserved by someone for 6:30 PM. Ok that makes sense.  We finally sat down at 8:45 PM by the host who seemed totally overwhelemed with unhappy customers. He seemed to do his best managing them and was cordial (appeared to be a young man doing his best). After we were sat, we started looking at the menus. There was absolutely 0 discount between regular prices and queen's feast prices that we could tell. In some cases, the queen's feast prices appeared higher than regular prices.   Looking around at the wait staff, they all appeared to be frantic. By 9:00 PM, we hadn't even seen our waiter to ask about drinks or give us water.   At that point, we were so frustrated and disappointed that we got up and left.   I went across the way to New South. I told the hostess of the issues we had at Mickey & Mooch and she took care of us. I had a delicious brook trout while my wife had crab cakes. The starter of fried green tomatoes and the bread pudding dessert was perfect.  Mickey & Mooch will never see a penny from me. They are obviously extremely poorly managed.",

My husband and I arrived a few minutes after they opened at 4 PM to have our birthday dinner together thinking that it would be quick service because we were the only ones in there. It took 50 minutes for us to receive our meal which was a fish dinner and chicken Parmesan and two sides. We were told that the meal would be coming out in just a few minutes and there was about 5 to 10 minutes more before the meal actually arrived. When we were served our meal we were served our sides first several minutes later as the sides are cooling down we were served our main meal. The food was OK however the service for the amount of time that it took for those meals to be prepared when we were the only ones in there was ridiculous. In addition the manager or the person on duty for that night was an older gentleman who kept barking orders loudly at the staff which was heard by us which was rude and inconsiderate both to us and to the staff that he was speaking to. So for the price of the meal the service and the atmosphere I give it to stars at best!!!!",

Their bar service is the absolute worst, they never get an order 100% right, and they can't cook a steak properly.  I have no idea how they are still in business.  I remember 15 years ago when it was the second best steak house in town, but it has gone straight downhill.   A steak house is a simple concept.  Good service, good sides, cook a steak correctly, and I will gladly overlay.  Not anymore....if you want a nice atmosphere with service with a smile, avoid Mickey and Mooch.",

We ordered a 9 oz petite filet medium rare, the rack of lamb medium rare, and the Chilean sea bass. Cabbage, loaded mashed potatoes, and green beans as sides. The sea bass tasted good, but was swimming in sauce - it was not delicate. You could barely see the fish under all the sauce. The filet came out between medium and medium well and had a disappointing sear, though it still tasted good. The lamb, however, was cooked unevenly, borderline rare in some parts and well done in others. It came with 4 bones, 2 of which were broken off on the ends - it was not pretty. If it wasn't for the friendly wait staff and the redeeming sides, this review would have been even lower. Not sure I'll go back, which is a shame since Mickey and Mooch is one of the few higher quality steakhouses in the area.",

Live music was excellent and if you sit in a booth in the bar area you'll enjoy it more because the dance floor comes alive to enjoy dancing as we did or just listening at just the right volume. Our waitress Smokie I believe was her name was simply wonderful just the right amount of attention without being a pest and well deserved the 30% gratuity I left her. I live in Huntsville but liked this location far more that the one right near home! Prices are reasonable for a good meal and drinks. You shouldn't be dissapointed dining here!",

I typically have a memorable experience and enjoy a night with good friends and food. However, this experience was very disappointing. Starting with the accommodation of our additional guest. Our waiter must have misunderstood the manager (Nor). When Nor visited our table he mentioned that he told our waiter he was willing to accommodate us after a few reservations were seated. However, our waiter did not mention what the manager stated. He was very short and stated we should squeeze in and add a chair. Also, I'm not sure if they have a new chef, but the food was not as good as it usually is. I love Mickey and Mooch; however, tonight was by far the worse. Up in the air as to if I return. #CustomerService #Disappointed #Food #Charlotte ask about IT! FF",

We decided to come back Again for my husbands birthday.  The butter was good this time but the bread was cold again.  This time the waitress messed our order up and only brought One plate out bc they thought we were sharing. Who shares scallops. Why wouldn't you repeat what the person is getting if you weren't  sure. Even McDonalds they repeat your order. Then they brought me scallops and there was one that was a 1/2 scallop(the size of a shrimp) For 28.00 I want all five big scallops. After waiting another 20 mins we finally got our food but they messed up the sides this time. Which I wanted the grits to compliment the scallops.  Then they tried to give us money back only to over charge us for four soups and two sides we didn't buy. When asked the manager and quickly fixed the \"mix up\". Not the top notch restaurant my parents would rave about years ago. Watch your bill.",

There was no special price usually associated with restaurant week, and we had no way to tell our servers that they needed to improve their game.  At that price it is just an over priced eatery that needs a refresh and an attitude adjustment.  We will pick another place next time for our friends and special events.",

The menu is masterful.  There is a great selection of appetizers, a couple of which would be a meal.  There is a large amount of seafood, chicken and ribs, steaks and chops, Italian...they really cover the meal territory.  Service we have had with just the two of us and on other occasions with a four adult and three grandchildren table is excellent.  No problems and between the wait staff and kitchen they staged the time for dishes to arrive so you could finish drinks, do one course and then another without feeling pushed or rushed.  Good job.  The steaks have been great.  Not big dessert people, we did have creme brulee which was excellent.  Certainly worth a try for a special event but call ahead so they are prepared for you table and wait staff-wise.",

I don't normally write complaints about service but I wanted to share with you our dining experience last night at Mickey & Mooch at the Lake Norman location.    We so anixiously awaited an opportunity to dine at Mickey & Mooch again to be sadly disappointed with the quality of food received last night.  It all started badly with the restaurant being packed for the famous Queens Feast we sat at our table for 15 minutes before a waiter came to see us, they greeted us and of course offered water to get started.  When the waiter did return she took our order and returned with water and ice cold bread.    Our meal, crab cakes for hubby and lobster pasta for me our favs - well not last night.  The crab cakes were tasteless and the pasta was not fully cooked and not delightful as we had remembered from previous visits.  Too embarrassed to complain we sat and picked through our meals, still awaiting our delicious deserts that never disappoint we gobbled them down and left.  I'm not sure about most guests but going out for our family is a big deal, we spent $92.00 and this morning we are sadly disappointed.  I don't believe we'll ever go back to the Lake Norman location it just did give that ring of an enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "Arboretum ooh Arboretum  My family and I frequent the Arboretum for shopping at places like Bed Bath & Beyond as well as Walmart and Michaels. We decided to slow drive through the entire lot on both sides to see what else was offered and ran across a couple restaurants. I immediately took to YELP to see some pics and read some review highlights to determine if we were going to try out any of the restaurants. After looking this place up I saw so many ups and downs in opinions and decided that we needed to down our own opinion and give this place a try and what better time to do so than Queens Fest Week as I've read how pricy this place can be.  The food was decent and edible, the service sucked as the server was very distant and unattentative. We had to nearly stand up to get his attention and get him to come over to refill water or to pick up finished dishes. The add on cost were ridiculous during Queens Fest. It caused the 3course meal to only be about $4 less than ordering from the regular menu which isn't really a deal in my opinion as a restaurant enthusiast who knows a deal when I see one or am experiencing one.   I honestly enjoyed my dish which was the crab cakes and having lived in MD for 2 years I know a GENUINE crab cake when I see and taste one. The string beans were also extremely tasty and you get a LOT. My husband had the filet scampi which was a filet mignon topped with shrimp scampi and he didn't leave any behind LoL. My daughter had lobster tails which was one of the upgrade cost and she wasn't full from it as she LOVES food and thought she was on a cruise at the Captain cocktail party where you get unlimited lobster tails LoL. For dessert my daughter again upgraded cost to get the chocolate cake which she is still raving about. I had carrot cake and my husband had the cheesecake. We all had dessert as leftovers and also the string beans as they give you a LOT on the side. My daughter had grits left over as well as that was the side she had with her lobster tails.   The amount of sides offered and the type of sides offered is pretty slim which is another caveat in conjunction with the overpricing.  Overall, if the service didn't SUCK I wouldn't mind spending the extra money to have dinner here once in a while. The hubby thinks we should try again in the future and hope for the best. If anything changes I'll be sure to update my review",

Then chef owner Mickey came out and apologized as well and comped my entree.  Very thoughtful and generous. He explained that he got to use this incident as a teaching experience for his cooks.  I found that impressive since I've been cooking for over 30 years and it was great to hear chefs are still teaching.

I have to hand it to Mickey & Mooch: they at least tried really, really hard to warn me.  Mickey & Mooch's absent-minded management decided to not staff any bussers or runners at their restaurant this evening which meant servers has to take orders, bring out the orders, and then clear off the tables. This resulted in some of the slowest and worst service I have ever received. Pathetic.  Mickey & Mooch calls itself \"Charlotte's own steakhouse\". If Charlotte mothered Mickey & Mooch, I think I saw Charlotte under a bridge off of Tyvola. When my steak was served to me, I felt like calling National Geographic because I discovered something I never thought existed: a steak worse than what they serve at Applebee's. I ordered the prime ribeye which was unseasoned, not evenly cooked, tasteless, and gristly. My sides were no better- unseasoned and completely tasteless.  I do not understand why this place even exists. Avoid or at least make sure someone else is paying and you ate before getting here.",

The cabbage and grits were great but not enough to make up for everything else. So disappointing.",

There was a very large table and maybe 7-8  other tables where people were sitting and eating. Bar area looked slow too. Honestly, about 3/4 of the restaurant was empty.  The man behind the counter told the gentleman to seat us at a table for two. It was a boxed in seat. Keep in mind, 3/4 of the restaurant was still empty... We asked the gentleman to move us to another table for two which he did.  Hubby and I were looking at the menu and had waiter bring us a glass of water.  After about 10 minutes, as we were about to order, the guy who greeted us at the door came over to us a bit flustered. He said there was no tables for us. The table we were sitting at was reserved. He didn't offer us an alternative. No other seats available.... We walked out. I will not be returning. Such bad customer service.",

The host was wonderful and find us a table quickly.  My husband and I shared a meal since we had come from a cocktail party with heavy appetizers.  We ordered a house salad and the lump crab meal with French fries and grits.  I was a little disappointed that our crab cake or first followed by the salad a few minutes later.  We ordered a small slice of the chocolate cake to go (best chocolate cake around).  The wine pours here are also amazing! The real shock came when we paid our bill - I went to add tip to our bill and thought it seemed higher then it should. We were charged gratuity of 18%!  Our waiter never told us it was added to the bill and it wasn't seen on the menu anywhere. If I hadn't noticed at the last minute, he would have received an almost 40 % tip.  I understand that gratuity is sometime added to large parties, but I have never heard of adding to a party of two!",

Ordered a beer & titos $17 waiting on table. Host was very nice. We didn't have reservations but said give him a few mins to a clean table for us. Restaurant week. Chilean sea bass was flaky and very tasty. The green beans were perfect.  Steak cooked perfectly, mashed potatoes (wow) and the braised cabbage was very good. The wedge salad was good size to share. And the 7 layer chocolate cake...guessing it was cut 1/2 since it was restaurant week which was perfect as even 2 sharing was still so much cake. I will say the cake was a bit dry but still very good when it's cheat day!  Mario was awesome. Always checking on us, making sure everything was correct.  If the prices were a bit lower we might come back. We might come back just to dance with bar crowd instead !  In all ... for the price the food could have been larger servings , or knock your socks off taste.",

I order chicken Marsala with broccoli, my sister or a steak Medium and cabbage as her side. My chicken was undercook slimy and chewy and the sauce tasted like it came from a plastic bag. My broccoli was not cooked at all it was hard and horrible. My sister steak was over cooked and completely dry. The cabbage had no flavor at all. Overall the food was horrible. The only good thing I enjoyed was the bread glad I filled up on it otherwise i would still be hungry. Overly priced and not worth it. Save your money.",

I was so annoyed and told her she should flip her sign over so as not to post off her customers.  Bad service continues here it seems.

I had shrimp and grits, which looked delicious, but disappointed big time because they were bland. If I ever use salt, there is a problem and I used it twice. The food was bland.

Even so, we won't go back. For the prices they charge, we expect much better service than what we got.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, a party of 12 of us descended upon Mickey & Mooch to celebrate the birthday of one of our fair maidens.  Based on the restaurant's decor and lavish entrance, I was surprised to open my menu and found that the pricing on items were pretty reasonable, considering.  I had expected entrees to be higher priced.  However, we soon found that \"lower\" prices come with many consequences.    Drinks:  After 30 minutes of being seated, some were still waiting for their beverages.  When they finally received their bottles of beer, they were \"as is.\"  No glass.  What kind of \"upscale\" restaurant serves beer without a glass?  We weren't sitting at the bar; we were in the dining room.  One of the beers was a Blue Moon brought in its bottle.  Don't the bartenders know that Blue Moon is always traditionally served with an orange slice?  It's like serving a lime with a Corona.  Someone else ordered a martini.  It was sloshed around as it was set down in front of him.  He had to wipe up the spillage by himself.    Bread:  Bread was served but it was cold (like it was taken out of a freezer and not fully thawed).  They asked to have the half-frozen bread taken away and replaced with \"warm\" bread at least twice; it never came during the entire two and a half hours we were there.    Salads:  We asked if we could get something besides a regular garden salad.  Our server advised a Caesar salad or Wedge in its place.  We were never told that there was a significant upcharge to getting a slightly different salad.  $2.95 for the Caesar, $3.95 for the Wedge..the same cost if you ordered them separately.  When this was brought to the attention of our server at the end of the meal, he brushed it off.  I'm guessing it happens a lot at the restaurant.   The salads arrived & we had to ask for silverware (for the 2nd time).  Several minutes passed and I finally got up and swiped them off an empty table.  Minutes after we had started using the newly acquired silverware and eating our salads, the server finally returned...with ONE set of silverware.  I guess we were supposed to share?  Entrees:  Our entrees arrived halfway through the salads.  After delving into the entrees, several people had puzzled looks on their faces.  Some had ordered their steaks medium rare or medium.  They came out with raw meat in the middle.  And not just a small portion; it was golfball-sized.  Medium rare means pink with some reddish tones; not raw.  Worse, one person ordered pork.  It, too, had a golfball-sized red raw center.  Trichinosis, anyone?  At this point, we called over a manager.  When the raw pork was displayed to her, she tried to tell us that it was \"fat.\"  Red fat?  In the middle of a pork cut?  Being served the raw pork is one thing.  Passing it off as acceptable by a manager is poor crisis management.  All of the undercooked meats were taken away to \"re-cook\" or replace.  The steaks were returned within a few minutes; the pork wasn't.  With the plates that were taken away for the steaks were the side items that everyone had ordered.  These were not returned on the plates and had to be \"re-ordered\" by us specifically requesting them from the server and/or manager.   One friend ordered drawn butter with his salmon.  It didn't come until he was halfway through the salmon, about 15 minutes later.    Halfway through my meal, I finished my glass of wine and ordered another glass.  It didn't come until I was through with my entree and the plate had been cleared.  Great timing...and I'm not a fast eater.   After everyone finished eating and plates were cleared, the \"new\" pork finally arrived.    Bill:  Did I mention the Wedge salad that was on my bill after everything we went through and it was brought to the attention of the server that we were never advised about the upcharge?  After all our problems, getting the bill with all the additions was like a kick in the head after being punched in the stomach for a couple of hours.    Summary:  I'm just telling you the story from my side of the table.  I don't even know everything that went on at the other side of the 12-person table.  I only gathered stories here and there.  It wasn't just one error.  It was one after another.  It wasn't just one person at the table.  It was practically everyone who had a problem.  When the numerous errors were brought to their attention, the errors were not handled in an appropriate manner by the waitstaff or the management team.  The biggest problem of the night was that nobody seemed to care whether we had a poor experience or not.  The kicker was that afterwards I wrote a 3-page letter to Mickey & Mooch corporate...and got no response.  They apparently didn't care either.  So I guess they won't care if I take my money elsewhere.   The End.  Happily Never After.",

    "text": "I went during Queen's Feast, Charlotte's version of Restaurant Week, so my response may not reflect the usual dining experience at M&M. I liked the place, but I don't know if I'd go back again. Their portions are HUGE, and their menu is pretty extensive, though full of typos. I got a mussel appetizer in white wine sauce, and it was equal to most place's mussel entrees. At the same time, my mother ordered a crab fritter entree that wasn't nearly as huge. I think some more indications on the menu regarding size would be useful.   The main entree I got, a Chilean sea bass and shrimp in beurre blanc sauce, was very tender. I thought it was reasonably sized but dwarf-like in comparison to the other courses, including the side items. When you ordered the chef's broccoli, it's pretty much the same size as the produce section's broccoli. Good if you're hungry, but I was overwhelmed. Be sure to try their wedge salad with blue cheese and special dressing-that was my favorite part of the whole meal.  Our party agreed that the service is a little unfriendly and a bit impatient. The server we had for the evening seemed annoyed with having to bring out boxes or extra knives. While the atmosphere is dignified but not stuffy, our waiter seemed a little pompous.  Though there's a piano there, our dinner group heard party favorite hits. It seemed kind of out of place having sea bass and hearing Michael Jackson.  The portions for the price is the big draw.",

Our server was nice enough, but always seemed to be \"in the weeds\", and therefore no extra attention or apologies were made after the slow service  or dropped food. Food was just ok....not good enough to overlook the other shortcomings.  We've eaten at the Lake Norman location a few times, and never had these issues. Could have been just an off night-- I do know prom was going on, but again restaurant was not overly crowded. Best part was the music in the bar.",

My husband and I first discovered this place about 5 years ago and always go here for our anniversary and special occasions.

If you get a mixed drink from the bar they don't skimp on the liqueur and water it down with ice like some places. Quality = Micky and Mooch!  We usually sit in a booth near the bar but have also gotten a booth in the dining room and a table in the room with the lake view. Lisa mentioned it's a great ambiance and I could not agree more!

The food was also a little too bland for my taste, but I would recommend the Charleston crab soup and lump crab cakes - you can definitely taste real crab meat in both and those actually had a lot of flavors!   Do try: white truffle fries, Charleston crab soup, lump crab cakes, white chocolate raspberry cheesecake   Don't try: wasn't a fan of the steaks I tried here, mashed potatoes, bleu cheese coleslaw",

I had read all of the reviews on Yelp many times for this place and was hesitant to give it a shot. However I'm glad we did!! The boyfriend can be a little snobby about restaurant but even he gave this one 2 thumbs up.   We both ordered a steak and they were both cooked to perfection. He even went so far as to say he liked it better than Ruth's Chris Steakhouse!! That's a glowing compliment since when we went there he thought it was the best lol.  I know some previous reviewers and even my mom have said service here is bad but we had great service. The ambiance is a little lacking but honestly it's not that bad and the food more than makes up for it. He got the filet fondue as an app and I got a salad. I highly suggest that if you are getting bacon on your salad (that or walnuts are the options), you try the house dressing which is a honey mustard bacon concoction that our waiter said he could drink right out of the bottle. It was good I will admit that but not quite as good as he thought it was haha. For our sides I got green beans (shocker) and he got loaded mashed potatoes. Both were good!!   I was a little disappointed with the desserts. They were out of the almond amaretto cake I Wanted to try so I got the cheesecake and it was okay. He got the tiramasu and he loved it but that's one of his favs.    The only thing that threw me was the guy in the bar area with the DJ. He was singing and dancing around (it was very club like) and I felt it was rather out of place. I don't know if this is a usual occurance or if it was a special night. I would expect maybe some rat pack piano playing type music or something with a name like Mickey and Mooch!! However I  will definitely suggest trying this place out and we will be back again for sure!!",

The Good:  Seated on time; cool old-school vibe to the place; decent wine list; wedge salad was outstanding; side dishes were great (HUGE loaded baked potato); crab cake was one of the best I've ever had; service was strong but not overwhelming or too stuffy; prices were very reasonable for steak houses in CLT.    The Bad:  We were seated right smack in the middle of two other parties at a 4-top table when there were plently of other open booths or other tables scattered around in more intimate parts of the restaurant.  It's just awkward when you can hear every word each other guest is saying when you know it doesn't have to be like this.  It's my understanding they chose to sat us in our location to balance out the workload of the servers - I get it, but it's still frustrating.  The steak was just OK.  When you pride yourselves on your steak, it better be good, but there was nothing special.  6 oz filet was cooked like I ordered, but it wasn't an especially tasty cut of meat.  Disappointing.  Maybe I just set the bar too high - I was expecting Del Friscos or Ruth Chris or Mortons and I received Outback.",

    "text": "We have always enjoyed dinner here; however, our visit on 12/16/16 was not good.  We made reservations for 7:00 p.m. and arrived 10 minutes early.  There were tables available; however, the hostess said they were not ready to seat us.  We had a beverage in the bar and she told us when we were ready we would be seated.  We gathered our coats and went to the hostess desk.  The hostess then asked if we would like to eat in the bar - no, we do not.  That's why we made the reservation.  She then made us wait while she located a table for us; and, again there were at least 7 open tables(?).  Our waitress, came and went.  She showed up once or twice to take the plates from the table, but she was not attentive at all.  The food was nothing special either.  We won't be going there for a very long time, if at all.",

    "text": "Mehhh.  I'll be honest... I expects a bit more.  The food was mediocre.  I had a filet which was a little over cooked and I got it Oscar (with asparagus and crab meat and bernaise) and it was cold.  Is that how is done?  I'm seriously asking because that was my first time... If it is I'm not a fan.  Mickey and Mooch get brownie points for being kid friendly.  The kids loved their food and having a really nice server but the food was nothing special.  I left feeling like we could have had the same meal, at chilis next door for way less money.  Another plus is the turtle pond and fountain on the side.  The kids enjoyed that as well",

    "text": "Dined here last night.    The food was probably three and a half to four star.   We tried the filet mignon, which was cooked fine, and had a deliciously fresh flavor.   The side of mashed potatoes was fine, but too much for one person.   The she crab soup was excellent.     The service was simply atrocious.    We had a reservation, and were seated within five minutes of our time.  (We arrived from out of town and were a few minutes late, but they accommodated nicely).   However, once we got to the table our waitress just seemed to forget about us.   It took thirty minutes just to get our order in.    She kept disappearing for at least twenty minutes at a time, and as a result, we were still eating our dinner at 11:00pm.    For the dessert, it took nearly twenty minutes at that late hour to go and find three plates of dessert??!   She was polite and nice to us whenever she showed up, and we just didn't say anything.    Folks all around us had long been seated, served, and completed their meals in half the time it took us.    If you charge these kinds of prices, part of what you expect is good service.   Heck, ANY kind of service would have been nice.    Don't think we will come back unless we plan an entire day for a meal.",

    "text": "My wife and I tried Mickey and Mooch this past weekend (Aug 3), having heard great reviews about it from our apartment manager. I really wasn't sure what to expect until we got there.  Note: the Providence/Arboretum location can be a bit tough to find; we drove around the parking lot for almost 10 minutes until we spotted it. It's in the southeastern portion of the Arboretum, on the west side.  The decor is jazz era-Jersey/New York and with the popularity of the Great Gatsby this year, this should be even more in appeal. The restaurant abuts a small lake, with al fresco dining, which is very picturesque. Even if you don't dine outdoors, I recommend walking out on the little overlook behind the restaurant to see the Canadian geese and other wildlife out there.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Mickey and Mooch has a variety of mixed drinks and wine (I had a hurricane punch, my wife a glass of Louis Martin), which was very good. For dinner, we shared a small lobster cocktail which was also well done (flavorful and not rubbery). My wife had the fried cod with a baked potato and I had the baby back ribs, also with a baked potato. The food is very plentiful and unfortunately we did not have room for dessert.  Mickey and Mooch's is rather pricey; a lot more than for the quality of food you get. The food was good, but the baby back ribs were pretty much like what I would expect from a Tony Roma's or Outback Steakhouse, which would have been a lot less. I respect that you're paying for ambiance and the experience, but at the prices M&M charge, I would have expected a little more zest.  All in all, it was a very pleasurable experience and we do intend to go back and try dessert as well.",

    "text": "Must say I was pretty disappointed on my visit here. I was pretty hopeful despite some of the negative reviews, because of personal friends who spoke highly of Mickey & mooch. The ambiance was especially nice too, but the service was average and the food was mediocre. I had the mahi mahi, which was the catch of the day, along with the charleston crab soup and also tasted the Alfredo pasta, collard greens, mashed potatoes and cabbage, none of which excited me. Our group went for Restaurant Week and the Queens Feast menu was pretty extensive; Unfortunately that didn't equate to extraordinary. I took my toasted almond cream cake to go. I wish there was a half star option because I would give this place 2 1/2 stars. I'll rate up to 3 just because the waiter gave our group complimentary dessert, even the ones who ordered off the regular menu. I think it's partly to make up for the lack of visibility we had of him. It took about 30 mins for him to bring our table bread, and we barely saw him while eating, so good thing no one needed anything! He disappeared for lengthy periods of time for no apparent reason. Maybe he was playing in the band? I forgot to add that as soon as our waiter came to tell us the specials, he informed us that they ran out of Caesar salad (is that possible? Wouldn't that be easy to make?) and baked potatoes.  Disappointing since I wanted a Caesar salad. Overall it's not that the food was nasty, just not memorable..",

The restaurant itself is very clean, with dim lighting and lots of booths along with a great bar area. The food is always cooked perfectly. I love the New York steak or the filet and salmon combo. Did I mention how great their prices are? I also love their grits and the fact that they have a lot of great wines by the glass, which is great for me because hubby doesn't drink. They often have live music. Service is always great too, we especially like one server who we tend to get a lot. I believe her name is Sarah. She's very attentive and friendly. Next time you are choosing between some stuffy uptown or South Park steakhouse, I urge you to consider this place instead.",

That's gotta mean something, eh?  I never knew how good grits could be until I tried them here.  Wow, creamy yet light and oh so filling.  I had the lamb, and the quality and the char on that lamb was spectacular.  I'm not a fan of wedge salads, but they make a damn good creamy house dressing.  The desserts were huge and fun too.  You know how you always wish there were more caramelized top to a Creme Brule?  They do it in a large, shallow ramekin, so there's more top to crack and enjoy.  One of the best things was the price.  It's was extremely reasonable by MN standards for this type of restaurant at that time.  MMmm, this place is such a fantastic memory of my fist visit south of the Mason-Dixon.",

    "text": "We ate here on July 15, 2014.  This location has slipped and here's why.  Here's a list of everything that went WRONG:  1. The table was not clean when we arrived.  WE had to clean it. 2. The Long Island Iced Tea was not made correctly.  (I know because I am a bartender.) 3. The waiter bringing the wine did not know that Chardonnay is white and Malbec is red.  4. The wait for the wine was over ten minutes. 5. The loaded potato that we ordered came cold and with the incorrect ingredients on top. 6. The collards that we ordered were lukewarm. 7. The filet we ordered as medium well came to the table as medium/medium rare. 8. The ribs we ordered were dry. 9. Food presentation was unprofessional. 10. Finally, the bill was incorrect and we had to find someone to fix it.  We ended up asking the hostess to fix it.   The only good thing?  The salad.  Other things we noticed:  The hostess seemed to be picking up the slack for several waiters. A table near us waited 20 minutes before a waiter came, which is unprofessional as there were only four tables in the section with customers and the rest of the restaurant was not busy.  Unfortunately, this restaurant used to be better.   Now, we will not be returning.",
