    "text": "I'm visiting the Charlotte area with my children on business this week.   I picked this place b/c of the kids eat free meal on Mondays per adult entree plus it was only 10 minutes away from my hotel.  We were eager to try something new... This was my 1st and last time going to this place.  1st when I went to place the order as I was asking my children if they would like fries and apples with their dinner the waitress says \"you can't make substitution on a free meal\" ... I turned to her and said I never asked you for a substitution.  However If my childr\u007fen don't desire to have something I wouldn't ask you to bring it.  So at that point I feel like were already off to a bad start with the waitress.  I place my order.  She brought out our salads quickly and literally less than 2 minutes later all of our food is brought out by another server... I'm like really we had just got our salads on our plates and started eating good... We weren't ready for the entree yet.  So what do you do? It was so unexpected for me that I didn't even say anything as my spaghetti & cheesy bread just sat there and got cold.  Along with the chicken tenders and fries. In the back of my mind I'm thinking about my options here ask them to take it back while I eat & bring it back later... or ask them to reheat once I'm done or what??? I just left it alone and we ate our food cold.  My daughters never got their drink for the kids meal.  Then to the put the icing on the cake as the waitress delivered the bill I had turned to grab my wallet out of my purse & she took the entire plate of french fries that the children had not finished eating & were also planning to take with them.  (The kids were at the restroom when this happened) So the kids come back and are like \"Wheres the fries Ma\" She took them.... So I told her she took them and that they weren't even finished eating their food...I had planned to get a carryout tray for it.  She said I'm sorry I thought you were done. There was no I'll get you a small order of fries to replace that.  Or nothing to fix what she did just an I'm sorry.  So I'm fully convinced..... Wont be eating here again...",

As soon as our server finally got to us we ordered everything, asking for the salmon dinner that we ordered for the kids to share to come out as soon as it was ready as well as our appetizer of cheese fries. 15 minutes later I asked our server if our salmon was almost done or the fries and she said 10 more minutes... after another 15 minutes they brought out the salmon dinner but when we cut into it, it was completely RAW in the middle. I asked for the manager and he said they would remake it. 10 minutes later they came back with another piece of RAW salmon. Mind you, my husband an I still had not gotten our entrees which we orders as soon as our server greeted us. The manager, Lucky blamed the kitchen and the server. After watching every other table get sat and fed (many of them having to wait a long time to even get drinks) we couldn't wait any longer and had to leave. So we had been there an HOUR, gotten 2 pieces of raw salmon, water and cheese fries. We left starving, with two hangry babies, and no food. Easily the worst dining experience of my life. Will never be back here again.",

One thing at a time.  The delivery was tragic.  There were three in our party that waited for nearly 90 minutes.  Yes.  90 minutes.  The only story was that they were working on it.  Finally the manager came out, saying the same thing.  Only when told by another member of our party did they get an apology, not just more excuses.  Those in our party who had this happen didn't have to pay for their dinners, as would have only be right as everyone else was basically finished eating when their food finally arrived.  As for the quality, our burgers were well done (nearly charred) the \"Cuban\" on \"Cuban bread\" wasn't.  The bread was indeed pressed, but having had Cuban sandwiches from places where they are quite real, those here are not.  For food from a \"Sports Bar\" kind of place, keep looking.",

Not sure if this is where I would go on a diet, but needless to say, I am not. The bar is well stocked (and always cheap domestic beer specials), but not always with the most enjoyable of a crowd.

Anyway, I assumed they had tons of reviews until i looked. So here goes... I ate lunch there last week and had something new, the fish tacos. I like how they keep adding new things to the menu and this is one of the newer additions. You can get the fist grilled, blackened, or fried, I chose fried and it was cooked to perfection. Crisp, hot and fantastic. The tortilla was good and the cabbage added the traditional touch. Comes with chips, salsa, and really good queso. Check it out along with the Cuban sandwich, Steak sandwich or the classic Chicken Monterrey. Decor is standard sports bar kitsch but the place is clean and vibrant, service is really good, and nearly everything I have had there has been extremely well done and consistent. Stop in sometime.",

You can't be expecting 5 star food at a sports bar!! Honestly its really pretty decent place to pick up a meal.  The Sports Page is just a block away from my parents house so I tend to come at least once when I'm visiting for a meal or two. When you first enter you can go to the left for the bar or right for the restaurant. There are tons of sports memorabilia on the walls to look at and tables and booths to sit at. But be warned the booth seats are dead and need new springs, some of them make you feel like a midget. And of course there are plenty of TVs around so you can keep up with the game. The bar area also has a small stage and they have bands come and play music usually every week.  The guaranteed winner every time is their Steak Salad its really tasty and filling. I've had their St. Louis Ribs and they are just ok. I guess I need to try more items but its hard when I only get there every once in a while. The service is friendly and my parents know most of the waitresses as they are regulars at the Sports Page.   Overall its a good place to eat if you're in the area, and if you want to watch a game with your buds I'd say the bar would be a solid choice also.",

At 12:40 we were told there was a large party who had 12:30 reservations and if they did not show within 10 minutes we would be seated next.  That would have had us being seated at 12:50, a fifty minute wait.  The large party arrived, and we were then told they did not know when they could seat us, and the wait would likely be another 45 minutes.  Included in our party were children and a diabetic, so on to Wendy's we went. I totally get that it was Sunday and we were a large party. However, we were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes, which became 1.5 hours. Sports Page consistently struggles with seating large parties during high volume times and needs to figure out an efficient process for accommodating these parties. Also, holding a reservation for 20 minutes is unacceptable.  We are lifetime Westsiders (as a matter of fact our rehearsal dinner was at Sports Page), however I don't know when or if we will return.",

The tacos were delicious I thought, but not worth $11.25. Probably won't be back. Oh, website says you will get 10% off order if you txt to their number but I never received anything- you also have to download their app. Don't waste your time  with that you won't get 10% off.",

After about 15mins our waitress finally showed up. She was very nice and took our drink order, which we got 10mins later. Once the rest of our party arrived we waited another 10mins before our waitress came to get their drink order. After another waiting period the rest of our party got their drinks, except one had the wrong type of drink. When ordering a Johnny walker black, he revived the red label and was never told they don't carry the black label. The food arrived 30mins after we ordered and it was cold. Despite being cold it was very yummy. The one thing that really made us question coming back was my beer. It had a moldy orange in it. One that neither the waitress nor the bartender noticed?! When called out to the waitress her reply was \"I didn't notice\".",

This place is cozy and friendly.  It's dated to...well...1982...and they weren't even located here in 1982.  I'm inclined to like places like this for that reason alone.  The food is what you'd expect from a classic southern joint.  It's good, it's probably fried, and there is a variety of digs to choose from.  There's nothing spectacular about anything, but there's nothing to complain about either.  I'm still waiting for that dish that makes me add another star...but for now....Sports Page is an average experience.",

I think most sports bars I've been to would get 3 stars from me, but a select few have good food.  This place is just ok.  I've had a burger here, blah.  The reuben was mediocre and soggy.  I will say, the chicken tenders here are definitely worth eating.  Just thinking about them makes me crave them a bit.  They are that good, in my opinion.  If you're big on sports and drinking, this might be a fine place for you, but I've not been there for either of those on any occasion I've been.  They have some very affordable options, which is a big plus.",

This last time I ordered the boneless they were overcooked and for a whopping $4.+ for an order or sweet potato fries  I literally had like 8 fries on my plate! NOOOOO! I've ordered them before and I was satisfied. Sometimes they have cinnamon sugar sometimes they don't. It's annoying! They have good food but the portions are not always the same and it isn't consistent. Used to be one of my favorite places.",

Just about anything you order off the menu is going to satisfy your cravings. They also have a specials menu that varies each night from .50cent wings, taco Tuesday, to fajitas night on Thursday. They offer a lot of variety and it is ALWAYS real good. The Nachos and Ranch cheese fries are a killer. The wings are always crispy and one of the best around. Just about any sandwich you get is going to be delicious, I would recommend the Chicken Monterey. They do offer healthy options as well, try the Fajita Salad. This place is also great for lunch and can't go wrong with the lunch deals. Sports Page has been continuous over the years and people always come back. Good atmosphere and even better food.",

Thank god for the manager Brandon to see what was going on and came over to fix it and helped us tremendously because we almost walked out.

We split the nachos and the pimento burger. The nachos were good with cheese melted on them, not a sauce. The ground beef had tons of seasoning and mixed into the layers of chips. The guacamole, salsa, and sour cream on the side were good placement.   The burger was well cooked but still had tons of flavor. The additional toppings were a little much but really good at the same time. The bread was too thick but still had good flavor. The fries were pretty standard and didn't have any weird residual flavor from other items.   The service was good and you can tell they work as a team. It's a very casual spot so stop by anytime.",

    "text": "***Please read this whole review to understand why I only rated 1 star.  I'm writing this review in hope of management seeing it so things can change. I really did not want to give sports page a bad review. In fact, I usually rave about sports page especially about their taco Tuesday. With that said, here's the deal. I have been to SP in Denver dozens of times and have never had a bad meal or experience, Their Taco Tuesdays are amazing!  So I was excited to go out tonight for taco Tuesday and we chose the Charlotte restaurant instead of the Denver location because we were closer to it. For starters the waitress wasn't very friendly at all and looked pissed off to be there. But in any event, I order my usual tacos that I always get and was ready to enjoy them. When I got them they looked a little less full then normal and kinda of just tossed together quick.  The favor was weak and they were very runny and not even very hot. I was so pumped for taco Tuesday and I left almost angry and unsatisfied, this was very disappointing.  I can't understand how the favor and quality can vary so much between the two restaurants.  So Denver SP = 5 stars ( always great), Charlotte SP= 1 star (get it together)",

Everything we ordered was horrendous! So disappointed because the menu really looked good and it's down the street from our house. I will come back for a drink since they have a cute bar but will never order food",
