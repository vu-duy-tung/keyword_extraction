I chose small just because I'd never had it before and i think it was the right choice. Delightful! I ordered the Korean Banh mi with bulgogi beef and it was so delicious. My husband ordered the marinated pork banh  mi and said it was good as well. Overall super delicious. We will totally be back.",

Granted it was 8:30pm and you could tell they were ready to close down.  We liked our sandwiches a lot but those spring rolls were the legit thing for us.  Bubble tea was a great addition.  We really like the decor and feel of the place and hope to return soon.",

This time, however, we were all quite disappointed. The bread was soft and soggy, the pickled vegetables were old and soggy instead of crisp, and the protein was tough. There was also way too much mayonnaise. Highly disappointing and unfortunate. Hopefully this was just an off day and they aren't consistently like this now.",

    "text": "This is a new Banh mi place,  located in the Arsley shopping center off of South Tryon.  My coworkers and I wanted to try them out, so we were finally able to do so today.   Let's begin with the drinks, appetizer and desserts drink.   My nephew order the coffee green  milk tea. I got the Che Thai dessert and a fountain drink. My Che  Thai  was pretty good and the price was reasonable for what goes in. Fountain drink was over priced for the size of the cup.$2. My nephew however did not like his drink, nor did I. It taste like it was water down Coffee and no milk tea flavor. The eggroll seem kinda salt and really no flavor. I have had better ones. The eggrolls do have taro, which is similar to potatoes. We also go the summer rolls but no flavor in the meat that they use.   Now let get to the real reason we came, the banh mi. They have some interesting banh mi. So we all order different ones and shared them. We got the Korean, Philly cheese steak, and  the banh mi buger. I have to say the cheese steak and the banh mi buger were pretty good and was season well, while the Korean  needed a little more flavor. I was sad that the korean didn't come with Kimchi. But all in all the banh mi is good.   They are still new so hopefully once they get the hang of it everything will get better.  Parking is a pain, like they have no parking spots. So you will have to park and walk.",

The taro bubble tea yet again was amazing, however, that is where the similarities stopped from my last visit. We wanted to try some sides off the menu so we ordered the seasoned fries and calamari and another order of the Korean Banh Mi (see previous review) since it was so good last time. The seasoned fries were average and the fried calamari were probably previously frozen and from a box and then fried. The Korean Bahn Mi that was so juicy and delicious last time, was not the same this time as it was not juicy and was a bit warm not hot, definitely a disappointment. I am hoping that the bahn mi order this time was a fluke and that the sandwich will be back to its original glory of my last visit.    Overall, I would come back again, but would never order the seasoned fries or the calamari rings again.    As a side note, I forgot to mention in last review that slightly more than half of their bahn mis are pork based, but there are still a nice variety with the Korean Bahn Mi and salmon to name a few. There is also a Bahn Mi Burger made with ground beef that I might try next time.",

The sandwiches are amazing, and the staff is really great about allowing everyone to play around with ingredients. Having bubble tea so close to me every day is extremely dangerous but I love it. I could be wrong but I think they use real fruit in them. They taste better than most I've had. The surprise favorite for me is the fruit infused tea. It's amazing and I highly recommend it. My absolute favorite sandwich is the Korean Bahn mi, it's so delicious and fresh. My coworker told me it was his favorite until he had the Philly Bahn mi so that's next on my list to try. Also, and the is secondary to the food, the decor inside is on point!",

    "text": "I came here for lunch the other day with some co-workers and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is clean, bright, and inviting. The menu has a section for specialty drinks (milk tea, Thai tea, boba, etc.), Vietnamese dessert (che ba mau, che Thai, che banh lot, etc.), appetizers/sides, traditional banh mi, and fusion banh mi. They also have your standard fountain drinks.   I ordered the banh mi special ($5.50), nem nuong summer rolls (2 for $4), and che ba mau ($5.50) for dessert. All three were delicious. I highly recommend the nem nuong rolls here -- they do it right! :) My only complaint would be that the summer rolls can sometimes stick to the paper liner they are served on. The bread they use for the banh mi is excellent: soft but still has that great crunch. One other thing I like about this place is that the sandwiches are a good size. I have been to other places that use much smaller bread rolls, but this place uses the True banh-mi-sized bread.  Fair warning: they do put some jalapeno slices in the banh mi (most legit banh mi places do this), but I wanted to call it out in case there are people (or kids) who can't eat spicy food and may miss it in the ingredients listed. You can request to not have these put in.  My co-workers ordered the Korean banh mi ($7), spam and egg banh mi ($5.50 -- don't knock it 'til you've tried it!), and the satay chicken banh mi ($6).  There were nothing but positive comments at the table, and we have already decided we will be throwing this into our regular work-week lunch rotation. I will be back to try some of their other sandwiches and definitely their specialty drinks!  Update: their banh mi thit nuong ($5.50) is also delicious and Vietnamese iced coffee ($4.50) is nice and strong!",

Banh Mi was fine. Egg rolls were over cooked so they unfortunately were overwhelmed by oil flavor. Coconut dessert drink was fine too. Though we were told the Che Thai didn't have coconut milk (even though the menu says so??)

Charlotte has a wide selection of Vietnamese restaurants that serve banh mis. The Banh Mi and tea company is a very modern and trendy looking restaurant with lots of variations on the traditional banh mi such as the banh mi burger, vegetarian tofu options,  a korean version, etc. I got the traditional sammich and was pleased with it. The only critique I could offer is that though it had plenty of meat, I wish they had more vegetables. The reason why I love banh mis so much is because of how fresh it is and how clean I feel eating it. I also ordered the summer rolls and was less impressed with it. The dipping sauce was great but I thought the ingredients were lacking- again, not enough vegetables. The rolls were sort of limp because of how few ingredients were in there.",

I'm in the area often for work and I take full advantage of the ChowNow app to preorder my Banh Mi's to make it fast to pop in and out. The parking lot is a HOT mess.. but it's worth the hassle because their Cha Lua and their \"Speciality\" are my absolute favorite! I do prefer Le's Banh Mi thit nuong and xiu mai tho. I'm not sure what Banh Mi and tea does to marinate their pork or season their meatballs but it's just not very flavorful. The bread and other ingredients overpower the meat in my opinion. However, to each his own and I am a happy, satisfied customer at least once a week if not more - thank you for existing Banh Mi & Tea! Cam On Rat nhieu vi lam Banh mi rat ngon cho em! Haha",

I still enjoy making a trip to Le's sandwich & cafe near sugar creek for a great traditional banh mi for a great price. But if I didn't want to make the trek and was craving it I'd come back. It seems like the boba tea is the real star! Can't wait to try it.",

I didn't get boba with my tea so can't attest to the quality of their boba, but the flavor of taro was right with just right amount of sweetness. The drink got a bit too icy towards the end but it's not a deal breaker.  There are more than 10 different Banh Mi on the menu, both traditional and non traditional ones. I ordered B9, the one with grilled marinaded pork. The bread was fresh and not as hard as a baguette. The pork was juicy, and veggies very fresh. It could use a little more aioli but I am pretty happy with my choice. Where else can you get a $5 sandwich with no processed meat and fresh veggies?  The place is clean and enticing. Parking may be a little tight during lunch rush.  I will be back to try more stuff on the menu, and hang out for a bit. They have lattes too!",

We didn't interact much but he was polite and I watched him with other customers and he was very nice to them all.   Banh Mi is something I wished I had in my life sooner than a few years ago when I tasted Le's Banh Mi. Their sandwiches are the standard to which all others in charlotte are to be compared to.  I ordered two sandwiches. The #9 and #11. I will say this, the #9 was freaking amazing. Neck and neck with Le's in my opinion. The flavor was so good. My only criticism is that it could have used more jalapenos. But man, what a good ass sandwich.  Now the #11 was a disappointment. Not sure what I was expecting. The pork was cold, I guess that's how it comes. I was expecting another hot sandwich. Just through me off. Maybe the menu should specify hot and cold sandwiches. If I may offer some advice. I'm definitely going back though.",

I arrived about 2:30~~ after the lunch rush hour. No line & the staff immediately waits on you. My wait time was roughly 8-10 minutes ~ I ordered the Bulgogi Nachos, The Banh Mi Burger & a lychee infuses tea. The dining area is so freaking cute!!!! My food was EXCELLENT! Perfect sized burger & the fact that it wasn't greasy, sloppy & heavy allowed me to enjoy the entire sandwich without feeling \"stuffed\". I definitely recommend trying the nachos. Dee-freaking-lush-US!!!! It's the perfect size if ur alone BUT enough to share. I'm NOT a fan of Siracha BUT that Siracha ketchup paired well with the burger.",

Afterwards, one of the workers came up to me to ask what my order was. They apologized for the wait, but that does not make up for lost time. I will not be returning to this place anymore. Long story short, I don't suggest coming here when it's busy. These workers do not do well under pressure, and you will be waiting awhile before you get your order.",

Surprisingly the service here was a1 from the time i walked in the door to the time i walked out. I ordered a chicken sub. It entailed jalapenos,cilantro,etc. The tea i ordered was definitely a winner.  Infused lychee tea that came with real live fruit bits mixed in. Needless to say although the sandwich was good i can see myself probably only coming back for the tea, the tea won me over i want to try more. I took my order to go. The employees came around with these big gigantic colorful straws asking what color would i like and im thinking to myself like why do i need this enormous straw but once i left and started sipping on that good tea i see why i needed it, so the actual fruit can swim right on thru the straw with the tea.",

It's an easy tie now, but you can't really compare as this places has their own flare. I ordered the Bahn Mi Special and the Green Tea Bubble Tea. The sandwich was amazing,  the house aoli was fire and a great compliment and the multiple pork deli meats reminded me of growing up in a polish community. The bubble tea was my first time trying milk tea and I was impressed.   The sandwich could have used a sprig more of cilantro and a couple more jalapeno slices to balance the flavor buy I'd order it again as is. The tea could have used a little more caffeine but was great. Beware as the \"bubbles\" are high in calories so that little shake-esque drink can add up to 1000+ calories.  Fire.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch got the pork sandwich, the xa xiu. We wanted the bbq pork and I think that's what this was? What we got was not what bbq pork usually is. It was not as sweet or flavorful as it usually is and the color was not as red. That aside it looked like a pretty typical Banh mi sad which with the baguette, pickled veggies, some mayo butter sauce.   The baguette was longer and thinner than I'm used to but it was easier to eat so that's ok. The bread was not toasted and it was not super buttery which was pretty sad since that adds a lot of flavor usually. The vegetables were also not as pickled as I'm used to but that might just be because the demographic they're serving is different. The butter sauce was also a little lacking in flavor. Overall I was not pleased with the bahn mi and probably wouldn't get it again.   We also got the popcorn chicken and asked to have it spicy. They don't do it spicy usually but upon our request they added some cayenne powder and it was great.   Bahn mi was 5.5 and popcorn chicken was $3 or $4. Took us a little time to get our food but that might be because they were cooking the chicken fresh. I've seen complaints about the parking but I'm not really sure why. They had two reserved parking spaces but there were quite a lot of other spaces in the same parking lot and more in the parking lot right next to it.   My rating is actually maybe a star higher than I would otherwise have rated them but I love seeing more Asian restaurants in the area and they are a family owned small business so I would like to support them.",

Their drinks are good and their ticket times don't take any longer than 10 minutes IF that.  My only issue is that I had eaten there twice before and both times ordered their Lemon Zest Tofu sandwich; being vegan that was my only option so I ordered it and had them hold the aioli(butter sauce). *there was nothing on the menu that said they did anything to their tofu, so I assumed it was just normal tofu*  After a month or so of not having been to the little shop, I go in to order my sandwich. I end up having a conversation with the cashier who then informs me that their tofu isn't vegan and is actually marinated in oyster sauce. I haven't been back since but the girl said I wasn't the only one who has come in looking for vegetarian/ vegan options and they weren't able to accommodate. (she did say they would be adding more items to the menu tailored towards different diets)",

A small breakfast restaurant once stood here, thank goodness they're gone! Muahahaha!!! Banh Mi and Tea is the perfect addition to Arysley town. I've seen this area grow tremendously since 2007. Many businesses have come and gone.    I placed an order for two sandwiches (B9) which comes with Grilled marinated pork, pickled carrots, daikons, cucumber, jalapenos, cilantro, and housemade aioli. The aioli is delish! The perfect amount was applied to both my orders. My husband is not a fan of jalapenos ( they were gracious enough to remove them). When I unwrapped my to-go order I noticed my sandwich was covered with jalapenos, sliced thinner than paper. No joke! I was expecting my sandwich to be super spicy, but it wasn't. The thin jalapenos were mild and delicious! Would you believe the bread doesn't take up 60% of the Sandwich lol. The bread is nice and thin and has that satisfying crunch in every bite!   This restaurant is easy to locate. The parking lot isn't big, I came during lunch hour and it wasn't busy. I found a spot up front. I'm happy to report this restaurant has clean floors and tables. The staff is nice and prices are afforable.   I look forward to enjoying more food from here.",

The food: The meat itself had good flavor and the pickled carrots and jalapenos offered the right amount of salt and spice. The best part: they didn't burn the bread. It was perfectly crisp and not overdone at all.   The atmosphere: bright, clean, and trendy. I loved their decor from the quirky animal paintings to the ingredients sign above the condiments. You can tell they put a lot of thought into their decor.   Customer Service: The cashier was really nice even having to put up with me changing my drink order. She was knowledgeable about the product and very friendly.  Drink: I took off the one star because the thai tea I got was just ok. I wish there was a half star option because I don't think this deserves a full star off but I couldn't justify giving 5. It was good but a little bland and not as sweet as I normally like it. That is a personal preference though so if you don't like sweet, you will probably be okay.",

They have fusion and also traditional banh mi which to me I thought was a little crazy, but I can definitely see why they did this and needed to branch out and be able to accommodate a wide variety of people.  The banh mis were tasty and I definitely recommend you to check this place out if you're looking for a good Banh Mi to go, or if you don't want to cook dinner. I'm a sucker for sandwiches and burgers, but for banh mi, the thought of low carb lifestyle goes out the window. They also have bubble tea, but I didn't try it out. I think it'll be something to try out next time, but I'm skeptical about that. The banh mi is where it's at though and that's what I would recommend.",

Dined in once and to go twice (in a 7 day period...lol).   I'm currently pregnant and opting out of pate- so I'm trying the fusions until I can try the traditional later! So far they are all amazing! My second Philly included some green pepper the first one didn't, both were great! The Korean was tasty- always made to order w/o cilantro. I order a black tea milk tea each time- with and without bubbles.   Today my non- bubble tea came with bubbles. They fixed this by pouring it into a new cup and replacing the volume lost with ice. I was disappointed but needed to leave for a meeting. My photo shows how a $4 beverage was mostly ice :(. The other two were not like this at all.  This time I also sought extra aoli (mayonase) but there is a $0.50 up charge for an extra swipe of mayo. They called to verify before making my order and I declined- very pleased that they called to check though!  It ended up not being needed, by I am still shocked at the fee. A small cup to go, I understand- nothing is free, but I'm unfamiliar with extra charges for heavy mayo on a sandwich.   Over all- so happy to have this restaurant in the steel creek area and will continue to visit- it's really good... I hope to see more value in my tea in the future and can't wait to try more from the menu!  I even had dreams about bahn mis after my first visit... I'm sure pregnancy related, but it clearly was impactful on my taste buds!",

But I ordered a pork sandwich and a spring roll appetizer to share.    Inside, the space is fairly small, with some tables directly across from the register that I would avoid if possible.  They blend tea drinks that are LOUD, but I didn't notice the seating around the corner on the way to the restrooms that are larger and shielded a bit more from the noise.    The spring rolls were brought out quickly, and the sheer size of them was a little intimidating.  They were huge, like a small salad wrapped in a rice paper.  The peanut dipping sauce made this a very delightful treat, that also felt healthy to eat!  Our sandwiches came out with a friendly smile from the employee.  They aren't giant, but the portion is more than enough.  Tasty, flavorful, and a refreshing change to your traditional ham & cheese sandwiches I am used to ordering.    Definitely not mind blowing, but a good meal that is more refreshing than your subway or firehouse, and is worth throwing into the rotation to keep things from getting boring at lunch time!",

I was pleasantly surprised to see not just one non-pork option on the menu but a few! I tried the chicken satay Banh mi which is a Thai inspired sandwich and then I took the bimbimbap / bulgogi Korean sandwich  to go. I also loved their Vietnamese iced coffee.

I do think that the Banh Mis and Boba Teas need some work. The Banh mi here is subpar compared to that of other places, and the boba tea is missing something. If you serve subpar food/drinks, you might want to consider lowering the price a bit.  Tip: Do not get the matcha boba tea  What to get: Che Ba Mau",

We ordered 2-Bahn Mi Specials (B8), 1-Lemongrass Tofu Bahn Mi (B3), Summer Rolls, Matcha Bubble-Green Tea, Mango Bubble Tea and Lychee Fruit Infused Tea.  Our food came out promptly and was presented well and tasted good. It's not the best Bahn Mi I've had but the bread was perfect and the price was phenomenal!!! They just seem to be lacking a bit of flavor in the meat. We have eaten Bahn Mis from Hawaii to the West Coast to the Midwest to the East Coast so we know a thing or two about this cuisine. The drinks were spot on, I highly recommend the Fruit Infused Tea! My daughter loved her matcha too!  We will be back and we will be back often because the price is hard to beat. However, I'll still be on the lookout for another location. Finding the best of the best is something we do.",

    "text": "TL; DR -  Really more of a 3.5 star rating for good Banh Mi sandwiches for Charlotte, NC but rounding down for below average boba tea drinks.  Even though I love indulging in smoked BBQ meats and deep fried comfort food goodness when I'm South of the Mason-Dixon line, I need a break from these rich and savory cuisines for some Asian grub.  The client site I was working at was nearby to Banh Mi and Tea Company, so I decided to pop in for a quick bite.  The parking lot where this business is located is a real pain in the..you know where.  Be sure to observe the signs indicating where you can and cannot park, otherwise risk getting towed.  The interior is bright and modern with lots of natural light from the multiples windows and nice bonus that there is a back corner shelf with board games for those guests who want to linger a bit longer.  I consider myself a bit of a banh mi connoisseur having enjoyed these Vietnamese staples in places like Westminster, CA and of course all over the DC area, so I always order the combo sammich when trying a new place out.  The B8 contains ham, pork roll (cha lua), head cheese, pork floss, pate, served with pickled carrots, daikons, cucumber, jalapenos, cilantro, and housemade aioli.      For about $6, this sandwich is a pretty good deal. And surprisingly, the best part for me were the veggies.  The carrots, daikon radish, cukes, etc. were all nice and crisp with a nice bright but not overpowering sweet and tangy flavor.  They were the perfect complement to the meat components of the sandwich.  The bread was perhaps not as firm as I like, but still was freshly baked and held up well with each bite.    But I have to say, I was very disappointed in my boba beverage.  Honestly, the milk tea tasted like a straight up powered mix.  The menu states the tea is brewed, but something about the flavor was off...maybe I got a bad batch.  The tapioca pearls also tasted a over boiled and too chewy.  If I had the time, I would've driven to the Kung Fu tea (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/kung-fu-tea-charlotte\">yelp.com/biz/kung-fu-tea...</a>) in town, but alas, I had to run back to the office since I had limited time.  So all in all, Banh Mi and Tea Company is a solid choice for a break from BBQ and Southern fare in Charlotte, but I'll just throw in one last caveat.  Because the sandwiches here are stuffed with veggies, just make sure to check your teeth after eating to ensure there are no bits of roughage left behind.    When I returned to my client site for my afternoon presentation, it was an hour before I took a bio-break and noticed that I had a HUGE piece of cilantro stuck to my front teeth...embarrassing but True story.",

Got a banh mi burger and a B13 which I'm forgetting the name of rn. But both were freaking outstanding! The bread itself is a prefect level of chewy and both the beef and pork were sooo flavorful. Both a bit spicer but just the right amount that adds flavor without just being an unnecessary distraction from taste. I will 100% be back here and frankly this place finallllly got the hubby to admit that banh mi's are in fact DELICIOUS!",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away based on my first visit to Banh Mi & Tea Co. today. I've had it on the list of \"must try\" places since they made the Yelp Charlotte Top 100 list and based on the reviews (particularly from some of my friends here on Yelp) I know there's something special here, I just didn't experience it here today.  I walked in around 12:45 today and started perusing the menu. Normally I come in to even new-for-me places with a game plan but today I decided to wing it. Decor is minimal but clean. Menu is split between appetizers, speciality banh mi, and traditional banh mi. They have everything from the Classic cold cuts with radish and carrot, to Korean marinated beef, Japanese style teriyaki salmon, even a banh mi burger. After looking over the menu a good five or six times, I realized that no one was really tending the counter. Two to three minutes later, a young girl comes from the back and starts making a tea at the drink station.  Another few minutes go by and the same girl walks to the register with no real greeting, I guess just waiting for me to order. I first ask if they do beef rolls as an option to their summer rolls, and I get a head-shake no. Okay, so Summer Rolls it is, I also ordered a Japanese Banh Mi with the Teriyaki Salmon. I was given a number and waited for my food. First impressions were that the girl running the register today wasn't really into it.  The summer rolls came out really quickly. Served in pairs and with a peanut sauce on the side, I'm quite fond of summer rolls and know exactly what to expect. The positive notes, the veggies inside were very crispy/crunchy and fresh. You can tell that they were very freshly rolled based on the wrapper being very pliable and moist. Unfortunately the pork inside didn't have much seasoning at all. I decided to piece apart the second roll to see if there was anything discernible about the pork and there wasn't really anything besides a good texture, not much flavor. I also thought the sauce was far too thick. The super thick peanut/hoisin sauce combined with a 'bed' of shredded radish on top of the sauce made it very difficult to dip.  My Banh Mi Sandwich came out quickly afterwards. Presentation-wise, the sandwich stood out very well. I was very happy with the bread, which was much lighter than most of the banh mi shops around Charlotte. I also like the fact that the jalapenos are very, very thinly sliced, as most shops put in this giant strips of jalapenos that can easily overwhelm a banh mi with spiciness. While the salmon on it's own was very good, I didn't really care for it as a banh mi protein. The house aioli didn't come through all that much and the texture of the fish compared to the veggies just didn't do it for me. I feel like if I would have got a classic sandwich or a Korean with the marinated beef, it would have been a much better option.  After I finished my sandwich, I sat around for a few minutes and answered a few e-mails. The lunch rush came and went, and I never saw anyone come by to wipe any of the tables, or ask any of the lunch guests how things were. Just another extra step that could make the experience better.  Between the polarizing thoughts on the food, paired with the very casual initiative of service, it almost felt like I picked the wrong moment to come here. With this place being just a couple of miles away from my office, I'll be sure to drop in again, I just hope to get a more inviting experience.",

I was greeted promptly and told the girl working when I approached to order that I wanted something yummy with boba. I've never been here so I asked her for a recommendation and she recommended the blueberry flavored tea so I took a chance and ordered it.   I walked out of the store took and sip and noticed my drink had a lot of crushed ice but no boba. I took it back in and asked if there was boba and she said their flavored teas don't come with boba. She said she can peel the top off and add some but it would be $.50 but it's not recommended. She went to the register and got ready to charge me.   By this time I was irritated so I just said no thank you and left. The tea itself to me was not good as it had a real artificial taste and strong aftertaste. I threw the drink away.",

    "text": "Although I absolutely love Thai (and other Asian foods), I've never been a big fan of Vietnamese food (not even their famous Pho). For some reason, I've always been underwhelmed with their milder flavors. Guess that's why I've never bothered to check out their Banh Mi's. Still, I've bookmarked this place for awhile now, so decided to finally give it a shot.  Well, I'll start with the big positive. As the ravers have it, the foods were totally on point. I tried the Korean Banh Mi and the Crispy Popcorn Chicken...and both were really good. I actually wanted to try their Spring Rolls too, but more of that in the next paragraphs. I also ordered their Milk Tea with Bubbles (Matcha Green Tea)...pretty good, but not cold enough.  This curly haired girl cashier was basically asleep when she took my order. I literally repeated myself 4-5 times, talking slowly even (yes, I got quite aggravated after the third repeat)...but she still managed to botch up my orders anyway, leaving out the Spring Rolls. I would normally just order it after the fact at such semi-fast food joint like this, but they were pretty slow in getting all the foods out...and the orders even came out separately, not all at once (my pet peeve). Anyway, I honestly don't know what was wrong with the girl. I was the only person in line, I wasn't talking fast (and I speak perfect English...no accent either), and my order wasn't all that complicated. She literally acted like a Zombie (and definitely not making any attempts to listen). Perhaps she was a Newbie, and was overwhelmed on her first day?? That's my only guess.  Anyway, again, I repeated to her several times that I wanted TWO apps (I emphasized this point to her as well!)...Springs Rolls AND Popcorn Chicken, along with a Banh Mi Sandwich. Not only starved, I just wanted to try several of their apps since they were cheap, and it was my first time. Not only did the girl leave out the Spring Rolls, she managed to charge me for the Spring Rolls...yet delivering the Popcorn Chicken instead. Not a big deal, but Spring Rolls did cost 50 cents extra. When they didn't even make any gesture to give me the change that's due to me, I actually had to ask for my 50 cents back. WOW.  Then the final point. Although the place was fine on the most part, the tables weren't bused properly. I came in around 1:30 pm, and my table was full of crumbs...quite nasty, in fact. I had to wipe it off myself.  Overall, NOT impressed with the service here. Food, YES...but otherwise, a big NO. Maybe I came on an off day, and maybe it was that \"dazed\" chick at the register, but it was just not that great an experience for me.  For the food itself, I would have easily given it a 4, but the service was a 1 (botched order, over-billed, and a dirty table)...which actually comes to a 2.5. Since I've been such a pill this week over hospital reviews lol, I decided to be nice about this one, and bump it up to a 3.  Who knows...I may give this place another shot. Most definitely looking to check out the other Banh Mi eateries in town in the future.",

We really enjoyed everything. Of the sandwiches, we liked the Korean Banh Mi more. Of the bubble tea, we liked the mango more. Like I said though, everything was delicious.   The customer service was outstanding. They were overly apologetic about the credit card situation even though it was my fault for paying with the wrong card online.   I'll definitely be back here again and I would recommend it if you're looking for Vietnamese in the area!",

They have appetizers, non traditional banh mi, traditional banh mi, and tea and dessert. We went to Vietnam on our honeymoon, so we are always out for the best in town. She was able to give us an idea of the most traditional banh mi and then the most popular banh mi.   We ordered the #8 and #9, both traditional sandwiches. Also got some spring rolls and a Thai tea. They have great tea and coffee offerings, even milk tea.   Our sandwiches were solid and more traditional like we wanted. Spring rolls were huge and good! Tea was also spot on. We live in Charlotte near uptown, so this is a bit far for us, but we enjoyed ourselves.  Check it out!",

We each ordered Banh Mis - a satay chicken and a marinated pork. We also got the spring rolls - could've done without. I guess with Banh Mi and Tea in your name, we should've stuck with just that! Satay chicken was a bit too saucy for my liking, I should've gone with the traditional, but oh well! My bf really enjoyed his marinated pork banh mi and loved loved his durian smoothie. He thought this was one of the best versions he's had as well.   The place itself is bright, clean and modern with cute paintings on the walls of some furry friends. If we had stayed in NC longer, we prob would've gone back for a repeat visit. Until next time, Charlotte!",

The ice from the drink machine is tiny little balls or barrels, not shaved but pretty darn close.  I love that.  The sandwich was wonderful.  Can't beat the price.  I will be going back.",

Che Thai is refreshing and da bomb with coconut milk but overfilled with ice, fried calamari is $5 but little portion, Green milk tea was average but wasn't as sweet and boba was small. Overall! This place just opened so they have a lot of room to make progress and improve! I'm looking forward to it!  Good job!!",
