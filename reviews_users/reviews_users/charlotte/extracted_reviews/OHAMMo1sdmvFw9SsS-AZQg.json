The baked chicken is always over cooked and the collard greens are filled with stalks. The service never comes by to give you any refills and when you call him (Tommy), he acts like you're bothering him to get you something. My husband always orders the fries pork chops and they never bring him a knife. When he ask for one they always bring a butter knife. We started keeping a steak knife in the car and bringing it in when we eat there. Today we noticed that they are doing a lot of construction, painting and moving furniture....so we will not be returning.",

When we walked in and saw the menu, I was shocked...it was huge!  More soul food selections then you could imagine. I'm always a bit skeptical about new places though, so I went with a favorite of mine, fried chicken.   Now, you may think I'm pulling your leg here, but I kid you not. This place had the BEST fried chicken I've ever tasted! I had the broccoli casserole and mac and cheese as my sides. Never tasted better sides. Even the sweet tea was just purely wonderful. The lady that took our order was as sweet as the tea, couldn't ask for better service. She recommended the sweet potato pie for desert, which was great as well.  I would highly recommend The Chicken Box to anyone looking for some truly great soul food. This little joint gets 5 stars from me, and I will make sure to stop in again for some more great food.",

I was in the mood for fish so I ordered the whiting dinner. It's usually pretty good. On this particular day, the fish was really thin and a little on the tough side. Can white fish be tough? lol I had fried okra ( my fav!) for my side and the taste was just way off! I'm going to blame it on bad greese. Any other time I never have a bad meal at either locations. Not the best soul food in town, but pretty good.",

This was a great meal, with great sides. They raved over the mac and cheese and green beans.  So far, we have been very happy with their catering as well as the occasional meal while out and about. Would most definitely recommend The Chicken Box.",

It also took 20 minutes to get my food which seems it could have been sitting out for a while.  I really want to love this place.  But, today reminded me why I only go 2-3 times a year.  I remember the 1 amazing meal I had and I somehow always hope I get that experience again.  All and all, I'd rather eat at Lola's uptown.  The food is much better and the people seem friendlier.",

The green beans were bland to me they tasted like canned green beans!!!! The Mac and cheese was just okay not bad or good and the perch was okay as well.

My mother gave me the warning not to eat the one on Sugar creek but to continue going to the North Tryon location. Once the locations were combined to the Sugar Creek location, I decided it couldn't be THAT bad anymore. I was wrong. I ordered my usual, Bbq chicken white meat, broccoli casserole , Mac and cheese, and I add a side of rice and gravy. I called it in and sent my boyfriend to pick it up. Once he got home he assured me the employee checked the bag for all the contents. When we finally open every thing we were missing 2 sides (My Favorite two sides! ). Once I finally cooled down, I began eating the chicken and it was awful, looked like they just slapped Bbq onto baked chicken (It used to look like it had been stewing for hours, The meat would fall off the bone) . It's safe to say I will never be back. To think I was in love with this place and spoke so highly of it!",

If you like to wait up to 45 minutes for ONE dinner plate and enjoy looking at the nonchalant face of the cashier who looks like she hates being there, then by all means, enjoy!  I have called to place an order before hand numerous times and every single time I come to pick it up ( I live 5 min away) it is never ready or even close to being ready. It takes me 15 minutes just pay for my preordered meal. Then when they take my money it takes an additional 30 min to actually receive the dinner.  I try going at different time throughout the day thinking that I might have missed the lunch rush and will hopefully receive my meal a little quicker. WRONG!! Same thing just minus about 10 min from your initial wait time. The sad part that they actually have good food!! That's why for some strange reason I keep coming back ( not to mention it's so close to my house). The last 3 times I went to order food, I couldn't wait 30 minutes for food and was pretty much forced to leave by choice. I gave them 2 stars because their food is good but everything else sucks.",

You order at the counter from the bewildering array of side order items.  It was really hard to narrow it down.  Ms T and I ordered a two piece and three piece dark dinner respectively with fried okra, black eyed peas, cole slaw, pintos and collards.  We chose corn bread muffins as our bread.  Wow, I'm getting hungry thinking about it and I just ate.  The chicken was very hot, fresh and juicy.  The salt was just right.  The coating was light, crisp and tender.  This is very good straight ahead fried chicken.  It is not peppery, either red or black.  The sides were all good.  Pintos were plain, perfectly cooked, perfect salt, one of my favorite things.  The greens had no meat or fat, in fact they have a little sign saying that they do not use pork fat/lard in their cooking, so I guess these greens are pretty healthful.  They were mild and flavorful, with perfect salt again.  The slaw was a fine Carolina chop with a very good creamy dressing that was slightly but not too sweet with good depth.  Black-eyed peas were similar to the pintos, plain, no meat, but flavorful and tender.  Ms T did not like the fried okra as well as she usually does.  I will have to yield to her expertise, put I liked it.  She felt it had been parboiled before frying, leaving it a little soggy.  It had mild but nice okra flavor coming through the light coating.  The corn muffins had good corn flavor.  This was a great meal of southern cookin'.  Again, we have found a place that is exactly what Sweetie Pie's in St Louis has the reputation for, but has completely failed to earn.  I have no idea when I will ever be in Charlotte again, but I would not say never.  When I am, I will eat at Chicken Box.  Might have to try the other location.  Strong four stars.",

When we brought it up, they said they would be right out. But they still weren't out by the time we finished the rest of our meal. The waitress actually told us it was because they were holding fries back for a large takeout order. On the one hand, I applaud her honesty I guess, but how about serving all your customers equally? We ended up getting it taken off the ticket.  So, if you're willing to put up with a terrible dining experience, you can get a good meal at a good price.  Maybe the moral of the story here is get it to go, apparently they'll prioritize you, lol.",

The food is ridiculously bland--salt n' pepper are not in their repertoire.   We ordered a meatloaf meal, and a whiting meal, and my daughter's father, a very un-picky eater left more than 3/4's of his meatloaf meal!  The cheese was totally absent from the mac n' cheese. In fact, it should be called mac n' cream. What really peeved me was that I decided to treat today and 2 terrible meals, a slice of sweet potato pie (that baby daddy is afraid to eat) and 2 terrible drinks totaled $28, not included the $2 take-out tip I gave them.  I want a refund!  Honestly, the best part of the meal was the candied yams (decent), the cornbread muffin, and biscuit. Please hire new cooks.  I gave the 1 star for the guy behind the counter. He seemed cool.",

I got fried chicken with mac n cheese and fries. The chicken was extremely salty to the point where i couldnt even eat it. The fries tasted like they had been cooked in the same fry bin as fish which made them pretty hard to eat as well. As for the mac n cheese it was bland and not to my liking. On the upside the service was very good, but i can guarantee i wont be back.",

    "text": "I love the original Chicken Box on N. Tryon but I decided to stop here because it was closer. I called ahead and spoke with a nice lady on the phone to order a 3pc whiting with cabbage, cornbread and black eyed peas. I told her about the offer on yelp for a free sweet tea with entree purchase and she asked that I just bring it with me and I would be fine.  When I arrived the man at the register was in the back and came out complaining about another employee. He said to a client waiting for her order, \"You see what I have to deal with!?\"  He and that client proceeded to have an exchange about the other employee's \"attitude\" while 3 other clients awaited his service. Needless to say, the lady in front of me (who was next in line) was displaying perturbed body language, which he completely disregarded.  When it was my turn, he asked for my order and I stated that I'd already called in for a pick up order. Instead of asking for my name and looking it up in their system, he proceeded to play a guessing game, that took about a minute and a half. Finally, he asked my name and said it should be out shortly. I informed him of the yelp coupon (that's available with check in) for the sweet tea. He condescendingly stated, \"Ya'll be usin' these old coupons! Here's the coupon we got right now.\" He then passed me a folded copy of the menu (yeah,the menu!). I explained him that I was confident it was valid as it was on the yelp page and was only available with check-in. He angrily went and got the tea and told me my total was $8.45. When I pulled out my card he said, \"That will be $9.45.\"  I explained to him that he'd just given me a different total and he said that was because of the tax. At this point, I didn't want to argue over the dollar.   When he brought me my order he complained about the bag, clearly trying to blame the other employee. He got a new bag. I checked my order and started to leave. He said, \"We good?\", instead of offering a genuine apology. At which point, I just walked off.   Now on to the food...  The whiting was hot and delicious.  The cabbage tasted like it had been sitting for days and had a light brown tint versus the typical green color. It had a strange aftertaste.  The black eyes peas tasted like they'd been sitting as well and were bland and watery. The cornbread muffin was dry and lackluster.  The tea was perfectly sweetened.   The one on N. Tryon is always a perfect experience and I'll keep going there as I have been since the 1990s.   Avoid this location and drive the extra 5 miles for a fabulous experience.",

The Chicken Box 2 is beside the Cookout on Sugar Creek, and I must say its a nice size location, I think it's an old Shoney's or something but it's very roomy for those dining in.  They have the same menu and are open 7 days a week and have added a tasty looking breakfast menu that includes chicken and waffles(mental note to try as my eyes widened), pancakes, omelette's, platters, sandwiches, etc.  I may go as far to say that I thought the food was better compared to the Tryon street location, but I'll have to confirm that on my next trip.  I'm looking forward to going back.",

    "text": "I used to eat at the other location at least several times per week thru out the eighties and nineties since we had a retail business right next door on Tryon Street. We sold that business many years ago and I haven't had the great fried gizzards, livers, and chicken for quite a while now.  For several years now I've been meaning to stop by the new location on Sugaw Creek and finally did on Tuesday, 7/8/14, craving gizzards. It was 11 am and they had just opened for the day.  To my disappointment their food truck hadn't arrived yet and they were out of gizzards. I overheard another customers' conversation and I believe he had ordered fish, croakers I think, and they were out of that too. I believe a restaurant should never run out of their products they sell.  But anyway, I got an 8 piece order of chicken and an order of livers since they were out of gizzards and away I went. I couldn't wait to get home so I started in on the livers as soon as I got in the car. The first thing I noticed the oil used to fry the food appeared old. That's another no-no for a restaurant that specializes in fried food. Got'a keep that grease fresh! The next thing I noticed - NO SALT! The crust on the chicken and livers was excellent - except the lack of salt! Maybe they just forgot to add it to the breading mixture.  Any restaurant  can have a bad day and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Will I go back? Absolutely - next week!",

I arrived and was met with a line of hungry guests which is understandable because it was right at lunch time and also served as a sign that I'm not go only one to find the food their delicious. The line moved quickly and I was greeted with kindness from everyone from the cashier, cooks in the kitchen and fellow guests. Their sign says \"Miss the cooking your mom use to make?\" Or something along those lines and It really is a down home place where you feel like a family member.  On to the food, I've only had their chicken but when I tell you it is HEAVENLY!!! Seasoned to perfection and fried so perfectly, it is SO good it makes you want to eat it all!! Even the damn bones and the parts of your fingers that the chicken juice has dropped on. Not to mention they have a very extensive menu of soul food favorites that I can wait to dig into. My only regret is that I wish that I had found this place sooner!!! Excellent work!!",

It being our first time, I wanted to try a little bit of everything so we ordered the following:  *Kids Meal with fish fillet and double side of mac and cheese *Gizzards *3 piece chicken wings *Smothered chicken with cabbage and green beans. *Smothered pork chop with greens and fried okra  We chose to dine in and so we sat our selves and waited for our food. And waited for our food. Then we waited a little bit more. Then they finally called our number. Everything came out looking delicious. But the key word here is \"look\". What made it so disappointing is that half of our food was cold. My pork chops were so cold in the middle and my hunny's chicken too. I didn't even eat my pork chop because it was too cold.   The mac and cheese was okay. The noodles were mushy and it was bland, it needed a little salt or something. The fish fillets were actually pretty good and we really enjoyed those.  The vegetables we had were alright. Fried okra was on point. It was hot and fresh and I just added a little bit of salt and it was so good. The other vegetable sides we had did not disappoint either but they did not wow our taste buds either.  The fried gizzards were banging. Perfectly fried and seasoned.  The fried chicken wings were on point too.   I actually liked the place. I should give them a two but what was good made up for what was bad.",

    "text": "I stopped here before my sons college visit. The food is awesome!! The service and decor not so much. It was my first time here and I walked in I thought I would have to wait for a hostess due to the layout but after seeing people order at the counter I just followed suit sine there was not a welcoming into the restaurant. I waited a few minutes to order. The person working counter seemed overwhelmed with walk-in and call in orders. The young man working the phone looked like he was a cook in the kitchen but trying to help out. The waitress fixed our drinks, gave them to us and just told us to find a seat. There's no direction on how service works. The lady helping us asked for ticket to see the order number. She was working the floor alone. We finally got our food and like I said very delicious but the dining room is much to be desired. Lighting is not good at all. Dark and the area behind us looked more like a catch all. I came to a conclusion that this may be a more take out place for the locals and I'll know next time. I will come back but only for takeout not dine in. Food- 4 stars, Decor - 2 stars, Service - 3 stars(because she was alone).",

Don't let the location fool you but this is one of the, if not, the best fried chicken in town!  I've read how the Gas Station Fried Chicken off South Blvd is the best but I beg to differ. The crispy skin and juicy meat here is one of the best I've ever had. The only thing holding me back from giving this a 5/5 are that the side dishes aren't as good. They taste bland without any seasoning on them. But definitely try the fried chicken here! You will not be disappointed.",

Every bite I had was full of flavor and so delicious. There are so many options, it was hard to choose, but I enjoyed everything I chose and can't wait to go back. The staff is very friendly and so attentive. You order at the register upon entering and then you can choose where you want to sit and they bring your meal to you at your table. There's a small wait for your food, but it's worth the wait, the food is freshly prepared while you wait. My daughter and I both had the fried chicken and fish combo, which comes with two delicious sides. My daughters friend had the fish and fried shrimp combo. We all had different sides, collard greens, cabbage, mac and cheese, potato salad and candied yams. We each enjoyed every bite and couldn't stop talking about it. We each had leftovers that were still good later.",

Very unprofessional. I ordered the Wing snack and Salisbury steak with dressing and mashed potatoes. (I hadn't eaten all day) the wings were really good. The Salisbury steak was horrible however. The dressing was also terrible. I did like the mashed potatoes though. I had a lemonade while I was there and it was good. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd stop by and just order the chicken.",

The macaroni and cheese was very flavorful as well. However, I was not very impressed with the candied yams. Next time, I will stick with the fries which are well seasoned. The Sweet Tea was BOMB and just how I like it (I prefer my tea very sweet).   The service is pretty good. Every time I order, it takes no more than 10 mins for my order to finish.

    "text": "This is my first time at the new location. So yea, the last time I had chicken box was apparently 5 years ago!  I got the two piece dark meat dinner that came with 3 sides. The sides are \"okay.\" The real VIP here is the chicken. I wish I went with the 3 piece dinner for a buck more instead. Learn from my mistake guys!  The chicken is most akin to Popeyes. It's delicious, but not as salty as bojangles breading. Give it a try yourself!",

    "text": "My sister and I were on the road traveling and really wanted some soul food.  We decided to stop here based on the yelp reviews.  We ordered take out.  The service was good.  I felt that the food was priced appropriately.  The portion size was average.  We ordered fried whiting, fried and baked chicken, and chitterlings for entrees.  We enjoyed the fish and chicken very much.  My sister said the chitterlings were just ok but if visiting again she wouldn't order them.  We had Mac and cheese, greens, yams, and green beans.  We enjoyed all of the sides.  We had a 30 minute drive to our destination and the food was still warm  upon our arrival.  We shared with others and still had a few leftovers.  I would go back given the opportunity.",
