    "text": "I ordered the catfish combo with greens and okra, along with a slice of coconut cake. I requested that the catfish be fried hard. My catfish and okra were both lightly coated. Neither of these items had a crunch. My order was \"to go\", so it is possible that the steam from the greens may have created excess moisture. I absolutely hate soggy fried food!  My grandson loves fried pork chops and we ordered the fried pork chops with rice and candied yams. My grandson was unable to eat his fried pork chops. I think that the pork chops were oven fried (like a shake and bake texture)..anyway they too were not crispy and had a soggy texture to them. The candied yams were horrible and tasted as though they were served right out of the can. The greens and the coconut cake were average.  Service: When picking up my order the female behind the counter was not very personable.   I appreciated the fact that I had the ability to place my order online. I also commend the young man who answered the phone when I called to complain about the food.. He was very polite, professional and apologetic; unfortunately, this is not enough for me to ever want to go back and experience this disaster of a meal.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to try out this place on a Friday evening. We walked in and noticed there were about 10 people in there waiting for food there is no signs or anything so we just walked to the counter and looked over the paper menus and then ordered. I ordered the tilapia dinner with mac and cheese and collards with a roll. My boyfriend ordered the fried pork chops with mac and cheese and collards and cornbread. So we went to a table in the corner and waited for our food. After about 20 minutes the lady called out our order we got up got the order and headed home. We get home my boyfriend order was accurately fixed the pork chops were seasoned just right the mac and cheese was really good and the greens weren't so good. I opened my box to find that my order was wrong. instead of tilapia i received whiting, instead of the roll i ordered i got a piece of cornbread instead of collards i received mac and cheese so i have whiting with double sides of mac and cheese and a piece of cornbread. I'm actually glad they gave me double mac because after tasting my boyfriends collards yuck. The customer service is just ok and the food is decent next time i'll call in my order to avoid a long wait and i'll check my order before leaving. I will try again even though first impressions are usually good they deserve another chance to make me a loyal customer.",

To start, the sides are mediocre and you will not remember them; just as I do not remember them. The catfish was okay, a lot of oil. The chitterlings are not chopped at all and resemble the texture of leather. I am from the country and I know there is no way they properly cleaned them. Now!!!, the whole reason I came were the oxtails... please do not make the same mistake. It was the worst oxtail meal I have ever had. They were tuff and  non-enjoyable. The meat literally would not come off the bone. They clearly did not allow proper cook time. All I can say is if you eat here order small and leave.

The fried fish is perfect.  I had the catfish and hubby hub hubs had the croaker.  He had to contend with bones throughout but a well prepared and plentiful portion of fish.  He liked his greenbeans and they quickly disappeared.  The croaker is not for the feint of heart because it is tricky not to get over anxious and end up with a mouth full of bones.  The catfish has no bones and plenty of crisp outside with moist tender insides.  I closed out with scrumptious candied yams that weren't too sweet and had a hint of cinnamon.  You got to taste the yams, thus avoiding a common candied yams mistake.  If dining in you have access to ketchup, hot sauce, and tartar sauce.  They are more than glad to have you dine with them.  Thete were only six tables, four of which had stools and high off the floor.  There is also a bar or counter with two seats available at it.  I am already planning my next trip.  Can't wait to try out more of the menu.  They have chicken livers!",

To deliver, they have something close to a $30 minimum delivery charge so even on my worst days, I am hopping in my car, sweats on and hair tied to go pickup my food. The baked chicken isn't bad (I always need to ADD salt to it) but that's only if they give you the baked chicken you asked for. About 40% of the time I ordered baked chicken, I ended up with fried and with as long as it takes them to make your order (chicken is made to order, and I mean killing the chicken, plucking it and all based on the ridiculous time wasted sitting around) you will, listen to me...you WILL happily accept the fried chicken and be on your way. Next, the collards are some of the best I've ever had and the macaroni is good but mama and grandma do it better of course. The hubs always gets the tilapia and is slapping hot sauce on it and licking his lips before you can ask \"how does your food taste?\", needless to say, he loves it.  Now the service... If you get the men, they are great. The guys are friendly, talkative and professional but the women? Let me tell you about the women. There is this one woman in there who the hubs and I call Aunt Jackie because she seems like that mean aunt that used to \"give you that look in church\" when you were talking too much. I DREAD having to correct my order or asking for salt because of the looks she gives you; Oh and don't let it be busy pshhh. All I can say is the food is pretty good so we frequent the place but there are def. a few things that can be approved upon.   This is also more of a take your food and go kind of place, not really fancy or big enough to hang out with a large group and really enjoy a dinner.",

    "text": "At Sunset Soul Food (SSF) they serve up some really good, down-home, southern style Soul Food.    I've had the chance to try a few different things from Sunset - the Crab Cakes are what I usually run, and I have to say, they are better than you might expect.  I mean they aren't Baltimore Inner Harbor good, but they are Beatties Ford Road GREAT!  I've also tried the scallops, and the wings and would order both again without question.    But listen people, this place is worth going to for the SIDES alone.  You simply will not find Candied Yams any better in this city.  The Mac-n-Cheese?  What?!?!  Out of this world!  Cheesy, greasy and horrible for you, just as good mac-n-cheese should be!  Can't give this place 5-STARS however bc of the ordering process.  There are all sorts of rules and stipulations such as $5 delivery charges, minimum orders for delivery,  and you can't even place a pick-up order over the phone, I believe you have to do it all online now.  Then if you go and order in person, you are usually waiting due to the fact that business is always steady and that each meal is made to order.    Despite the quirks about the ordering process, SSF is a solid 4-stars and a must-try if you're in the area (or even if you're not).  Don't play with this spot, you won't find better soul food in the Charlotte area.",

I went on a Sunday night around 6:30; there was plenty of parking and I was able to order right away. The two young ladies in the front were very friendly and helpful. I initially wanted the baked chicken but they were out so I ordered the turkey wings with collard greens and broccoli casserole; my fiance had the 3 fried chicken wings with Mac and cheese and yams and a side of shrimp. The turkey wings were delicious, the collards were decent and the broccoli casserole and shrimp were just ok. The fried chicken was yummy as were the Mac and cheese and yams. We also tried a apple cobbler and peach cobbler. My peach cobbler wasn't very good; it mostly tasted like burnt crust and I ended up tossing it in the trash. I opted not to try his apple cobbler. Overall I would recommend this place and I'm sure I'll be back again to try out a few different dishes.",

Tasteless. And a shrimp order with fries. The shrimp was great. I had many shrimp. And it was reasonably priced. I also tried lemonade and that was good. I had some kids with me. So we decided to order the children's meal. Chicken fingers and french fries which was accompanied with this I drink we thought. The drink that they give you is a small box drink and my kids we're not happy with that! I think for the money and small drink of lemonade or punch would have been nice.

I had the beef stew which was tender but needed salt. The broccoli casserole was pretty good but the dressing was probably the worst dressing I've ever had in my life. My fiance ordered barbecue and dressing as a side and he couldn't even finish it. My son was the only one who seemed to enjoy his food, he had barbecue ribs. With all stated, I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews. This was probably one of the worst soul food restaurants I've eaten from. Don't believe the hype. Sadly I'm still on my search for great soul food.",

They have a very varied menu and everything that we have tried here has been mind blowing.  We typically get the oysters (fried, of course), the shrimp po' boy sandwich and sides. All of their sides are yummy but we especially love the fried okra, baked beans and the mac n' cheese.  This one time we tried their crab legs which were delicious and so succulent too. Tried to reproduce them at home once when I was craving those legs but turned out pretty bad :) These guys must have magical powers to make everything taste so amazing. I wish they were closer to home or a little more on our way. But the drive here is worth it, every single time!",

I'm not sure where the high stars have come from, but I can tell you they are completely False.  I Recently ordered a Leg & Thigh dinner with mac & cheese + yams with the additional sides of potato salad and dressing.   Simple breakdown-  The chicken, dry with an interesting twist of overly salty and flavorless. How can that be?  The yams, canned, dry, and no seasoning. I seriously feel as if they drained them from an expired store brand can and put them in my container. All bad!  The Mac and cheese... How does one mess up macaroni and cheese? Oh. By forgetting the cheese! I'm unsure how they were able to  turn the macaroni yellow because I can assure u there was NO cheese in it! I was baffled. I should probably give them two stars for being able to manufacture food that seemingly \"looks\" appealing but has completely no flavor. That's takes talent!   The dressing... OMG! As soon as it went in my mouth, it came out! It seriously tasted like month-old cornbread with a packet of ramen noodle seasoning on top. The gravy was just thick paste of no flavor!!  The potato salad.. They must have forgotten to add it to my order (although I paid for it) and  gave me canned greens instead.   If you're looking for decent soul food in the Queen City (lunch or dinner) try Luwans and/or Merts.",

I Believe I had three pieces of catfish, about 4/5 pc of shrimp, mac n cheese, and mash potatoes.  It came with corn bread but I took a bite of it.  I definitely wanted to try the peach cobbler.

If you go, definitely go for the food and not expectations of a fine/casual dining establishment. It's just what the name implies-- a gril and very limited space in a strip mall. There are a few tables if your small party decides to dine in.   I have to agree with other posters that the fried shrimp is deliciously prepared with just the right about of seasoning and breading, so were the okra. This is a big plus in my book where some places tend to go overboard. :)  The pintos did lack flavor, but again the fried shrimp stole the show. By the way, they do not stock fountain drinks, so if you want a soda it will be in a can--of course that means NO refills. They do also offer lemonade, half&half ( tea and lemonade) and water.

    "text": "I've eaten here once a month for nearly 2 years; let me tell you why: First, I can totally vouch for the fried whiting & croaker, mac&cheese, yams, and TURKEY RIBS WHICH ARE INSANELY WONDERFUL. I live 15 miles from the restaurant, and make the trip whenever I crave soul food & good company, which leads me to #2. The front counter staff (Dottie, Henrietta, and owner Ralph) treat you like family, which is really at the heart of a good soul food restaurant. Yes, it is located in a strip mall and is no where near \"upscale\". So what?!  What it IS is clean, well-lit with natural light, tiny & welcoming, and that's what REAL SOUL food is about! When I want upscale, I go upscale, but I have business & personal lunches here, and love to watch my guests enjoy the food & the staff despite the tiny modest set-up. It also sends a good message about the fundamentals of a good business. 70% of orders are for take-out, so there is much movement in & out the door, but there are about 8 tables of varying sizes to accommodate diners. As people wait for either their takeout or food to the table, strangers chat, and you discover who moved to Charlotte from where, and everything else beautiful about human interaction. For all you NYC transplants to Charlotte like myself, the owner Ralph is a native New Yorker, so the place has the authentic NYC soul-food 125th st vibe. Lastly, this is a small business putting out a great product every day ALONG with great customer care. They work hard together as a team, and it is really inspiring to watch, especially when that phone starts ringing non-stop with orders. They simply aim to treat you right, make sure you're comfortable, and make sure you're thrilled with your food. With the average meal with heavy portions setting you back a mere $10, how could anything be more perfect?",

The restaurant isn't exuberant or anything, just your average order at the counter place with many regulars on the weekends.   Batter is pretty tasty and fries and hushpuppies are okay. In addition to the traditional fish fry items they also offer snow crab legs, scallops and even salmon. Whiting fillets might come with skin and bones, so eat with care. A good sign of real fish though!",

However, I would visit again if I happen to be in the area and have a taste for some friend shrimp.  Their fried shrimp was (4)starts! I had fried crabcake, shrimp, fries & coleslaw.  I asked if the crabcake was lump meat and was told yes.  I believe it was, but it didn't cut it for me (too breaded).  Maybe my expectation is high in regards to crabcakes (me being a DC native).  Anyway the service was cool and I would visit again.",

When the whiting sandwich came to me, it had 3 pieces of whiting. I'm guessing that the 2 on each side of the main piece was supposed to be a substitute for the bread. When my wife told me to just tell the waiter that the bread is missing I was skeptical because I said he knows.. when he bought the food out he stated whiting sandwich implying that we were on the same page and that was the food I had ordered. We were not on the same page at all and it seemed as if he was reading a different book entirely. I may not be a chef but I do know that the main staple food of ANY sandwich is the bread. The cashier seemed flustered that so much people was ordering during lunch that she couldn't keep up with the orders in a timely manner. I hate giving most places just a couple stars if the food was good but customer service and food management is a pretty big deal for me.",

I noticed all of the great reviews and decided to go there. When I arrived, I was greeted with warm smiles and prompt attention. I ordered the fried catfish dinner with collard greens, potato salad and Mac and cheese. The food was outstanding. I enjoyed the tangy taste of the collards and the fish was seasoned perfectly. It was a great meal. The only thing I can complain about is the time it took to receive my meal. It wasn't an hour, but for the people there it seemed that it shouldn't have taken as long as it did. Overall though, a great place that I will revisit when I return to The Charlotte area.",

They actually use pieces of fish not the formed square fish I think it was haddock. Light breading toasted bun with home made tarter sauce good sandwich $6.00 and thats all you got. I hope their business picks up I know the rent at that location is very high. They also have other seafood shrimp calamari will stop again...",

This Soulfood is  Amazing I had the best fried boneless chicken I've ever eaten in my life and fried to absolute perfection , the collards like manna from heaven and the mashed potatoes and gravy too.  My husband had and love the bone in breast .  I miss my granny's cooking (Tarboro, NC) and Sunset Soulfood took me back there.  Sweet potato  pie was Yum yum .

Just rice. I was pretty furious lol. I wasn't going back for a cup of gravy. So i ended up going to the store by my house to buy some gravy so i could have it with my rice since it was closer.

They are a nice plump size and without all the bread crumbs on it instead they have light batter that they are fried in and they are simply delicious.   The mac and cheese is probably some of the best I have had since moving to Charlotte. The sweet potatoes surprised me. I typically enjoy them okay, mostly around holidays or in a pie or simply baked, but these bad boys right here - they were delicious and I couldn't stop eating them.  I really also enjoyed the cabbage but would pass on the greens.  The fish was pretty good, not the best I have ever had but it was pretty tasty none the less. And I really enjoyed their pig feet, trotters, whatever you want to call them. They were very tender and soft. The fried chicken wings were on point.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in the mood for soul food carry-out.",

I can give you the address & the name on the card i payed with.\" She says \"Ok. Yes it is here you will receive it within a half hour\" *CLICK* ARE YOU KIDDING ME????   Im sorry that I ordered online where i paid with my card and i want to confirm my order was received. Smh the nerve of that woman.   Ordered the crab cake dinner with collard greens and mac & cheese. Crab cakes were smushed thin and the batter used to fry then wasnt that great but the overall taste was decent. Also got the crabfish & shrimp combo which was good. No complaints about that. We also ordered 3 desserts a red velvet cake, peach cobbler, and a banana pudding. The only one that was good was the red velvet.   Ill have to give them 3stars. What was good was good and what wasnt wasnt.",

    "text": "I have ordered from Postmates on about 3 occasions and this food is BOMB. Its the best soul food I've had in Charlotte thus far, however I've only been here 6 months. I've had the following items:  -Fried Chicken (10/10) The most amazing crust and seasoning and the meat is moist/seasoned. They aren't small portions either. -Baked Chicken (8/10) I thought it was a smidge salty and considering I ordered fried I was a bit disappointed. -Candied Yams (10/10) Best I've had so far, it wasn't drenched in corn syrup and the sweet potatoes weren't cooked to the point of being mashed. A generous amount of cinnamon. Just Yummy! -Mac and Cheese (10/10) My FAVORITE thing to get from this place. It's not the loose, liquidy type M&C (they serve @ NaNas Soul Food-GROSS). It's cheesy and has an awesome flavor. -Broccoli Casserole (3/10) Super bland and mushy, wont be having that again -Potato Salad (10/10) Man this potato salad is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Chunky,creamy,I believe it has relish, its just DELICIOUS. - Cornbread (10/10) Firm and moist , tastes fresh and not boxed (Like Soul Central Soul Food) -Fried Cat Fish (10/10) tastes bomb af   We did drive to the location one time with the intention of eating in, HOWEVER upon parking(which was limited and tight) we decided against it. It's small and there were what looked liked a bunch of guys just \"hanging out\". We weren't interested in what the vibe looked like. ORDER DELIVERY",

It's bad enough that there aren't any soul food places on my side of town, I was hoping that this establishment would've been what I was looking for...missed the mark big time! First of all, the GPS wrong and you end up at the Food Lion across the street, so make sure you call and ask exactly where they're located and to give you a landmark.    I get there at 8:04 and place my order for a dark meat plate with Mac & Cheese and collard greens.  15 min goes by, then 20 min, then 30min and the guy finally comes out with my order.  He opens the styrofoam container and there are two dried out legs.  I looked at the guy and said sorry but, that's not what I ordered.  Then the girl that was at the register said oh yeah, they ran out of thighs and I forgot to tell you.  So after a few minutes of back and forth commentary, I asked the guy could substitute one of the legs with a few wings.  He said, let me ask and then he came back and said yeah, I could get two wings.    After waiting another 10 minutes, the girl pointed over to me and asked the guy at the counter...what happened to her, why is she still waiting?  I shrugged my shoulders and went back to watching tv.  After waiting another 10 min, I got so frustrated went to the register and asked for my money back and walked out.  I'll NEVER walk back into that place again.  I'd rather pay $10 and drive out of my way and go to Floyd's Soul Food on Graham Street or Nana's on Tyvola and Yorkmont Road.  Unfortunately since I wasted so much time, the other two resturant's were closed so I ended up with nothing.",

I ordered my meal at 11:35 am, and rang out 35 minutes later (-1 star).  I haven't even started eating, either.  I should've checked my order before leaving 'cause I got potato salad instead of mac-n-cheese (- 2nd star).  However, my server was the glaring, non-smiling church Aunt and not the happy-go-lucky, smiling, cheery guy (see other reviews), so I didn't really want to add another wrinkle to her furrowed brow, YKWIM?  The chicken was plentiful and the collards tasty, but they were very salty even for me who salts everything.  My chicken breast was so big it looks like the local cock fighting prize rooster finally lost and made it onto my plate.  Unfortunately, they butchered him a second time by frying away every last ounce of life.  Just a big, beautiful dry hunk of meat.  Sorry, champ (-3 stars).  For me, on this visit, it was just meh.",

When I arrived, they were still finishing up the order so it seemed like perfect timing.  I ordered the perch sandwich with fries, an Arnold palmer and the lemon pound cake.   The perch was well done and a nice healthy portion. The fries were perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned. The Arnold palmer was made from homemade sweet tea and lemonade and hit the spot.   The lack of a star is for the cake. Though touted as homemade, it tasted store bought and overly sweet and was served cold. It was the thing I was looking forward to the most and thing I was most disappointed by. The other let down was the value. It was a bit pricey for such a basic order, especially given that there are cheaper options of the same quality nearby (and with better cake).   The service was great and efficient. The staff are warm and friendly and willing to help. I would come back if someone in the office or friends were ordering from here. I was certainly intrigued by the fatback special on the menu (which I love but rarely get to enjoy) and the fried shrimp.  All in all a pretty good experience.",

    "text": "I can understand the low ratings on this place as a result of the service. It almost prevented me from trying it out. Almost.  The hubs had a craving for oxtails but I didn't want to spend hours cooking. Luckily Yelp helped me find a spot that serves it. He usually eats it in Asian form - in a soup with noodles. But since I wasn't up to making it, I'll try something different. So glad I did!   This place is easy to miss and there's construction in the area which makes it worse. Be on the lookout! It's behind Aldi's in a little strip. Parking is scarce and the place gets pretty busy (at least it was during lunch) so be prepared.   I ordered food to go. The service was meh - I chalked It off to them being so busy and flustered. Two ladies were at the counter taking orders. One was extremely lovely and inviting while the other was not. The latter was probably why so many people gave it 1 star for service. I didn't let that deter me as I care about the food. And oh my goodness the food!   Fried chicken - You'll have to wait a good 20-30 minutes for it but it's well worth the wait cause it's fried fresh! Crispy salty skin with moist flavorful meat. There's a hint of Cajun spice, just enough to tickle your tastebuds. I had the leg and thigh combo and added 3 wings for only $4. Those wings were huge! Easily the size of my palm - see my pics for proof. I'm never going to Bo's again!   The oxtails - the hubs was in love. And so was I. The box had to weigh at least 5 lbs of solid food. Oxtails were tender in a rich gravy over rice. And the portion for the price - how do they make a profit giving away that much food?!?!?! It was so good, the hubs is already asking me to order it for him again!   The sides - everything was delicious.  Mac and cheese - more cheese than there was pasta and we had no complaints about that!  Collard greens - sprinkle a little hot sauce and it was perfect. Texture was also perfect- not mushy, not hard. Cabbage - my son had a bite of it and was in awe. I cook cabbage at home and the little punk said \"you don't make it like this!\" Ha ha no son, I sure don't.   Two plates fed a family of 4 - that's how big their portions are. I wish the customer service was better  from the one lady but it's all good. The other lady made up for it and the food was so friggin good, I'll definitely make this place a regular stop!",

Maaaaaaannn listen! I'm so glad we decided to go. We picked a good time. It was about 7pm this evening. There was ample parking and no wait.   We ordered chitterlings, oxtail and rice with cabbage and greens and 2pc leg and thigh with greens and candied yams..., all served with cornbread.   The food was COMPLETELY DELICIOUS!   They have such an extensive menu. At first it was really difficult to choose. But.... Now that we have had a taste, we will certainly be back for more. The prices are affordable and the food is plentiful. A plate is enough to feed 2 people.  And as far as the customer service, E was excellent. She was personable, upbeat and very attentive.   And the icing on the cake.... The music was on point.  Can't wait to try more off the menu!!!",

Well the lady was rude and hung up before I could give her another order that should've been a sign. I arrived and a few minutes later my order was ready ( look) before you leave. I arrived home and was I disappointed. The crab legs were taken off the cluster and had a horrible taste. Later that night I couldn't hold nothing on my stomach.

    "text": "I don't know what the food taste like, because as I surpass an 1.15 minute wait for my food that they said 25,   I'm now pretty upset.  No explanation l, instead I get, \"they working on it\". I was ok with the 30 minute wait, but after an hour , I still showed patience by waiting without question. An hour and a half later, pretty upset. Then they forgot something out of the bag and so I had to ask for it and literally had to bag it myself. What a joke of a business, never mind the heat, never mind how dirty it was, never mind the lack of service, I came for the food, and they're depriving me of it because I really don't care anymore. Where I come from, if someone drops the ball in your establishment and you make the customer wait 3x what you told them, you try and do right by them and you offer them something. I didn't come for free food, cause judging by my order size, you should know that I really didn't worry about the price about $60. At least offer, if you did, I wouldn't take my money back, I'd just be happy that you offered and it would ease my conscience. I love hole in the wall places, cause they usually have the best food. The sign said \"worth the wait\" NO! IT REALLY WASNT WORTH IT! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AND GO DOWN THE ROAD, plenty of other soul food restaurants within 15 minutes.",

Nothing came with seasoning except the french fries. The mac n cheese  was a greasy cheese taste with no flavor at all. Me and my wife will not be wasteful anymore about spending hard earned money on a very distasteful restaurant. I feel that if im going to spend high menu prices then i need to be getting some spices in my food! For the people who would like to come and check this restaurant out always and remember to bring your season rack!!",

    "text": "I tried Sunset Soul Food for the first time today. I must say, I am very happy that I did. I ordered online through the Yelp app which is very very convenient. When I walked in, I was happy to see a Tyler Perry Cast behind the counter. Just good ole down home people laughing and enjoying what they do. Just the atmosphere let me know that I was in for a culinary treat.  I ordered the wing/whiting combo. For only $13.00 trying both their chicken and fish with two sides is a bit of a bargain really. I have to say, what I got was well worth it. They truly believe in giving you a down home country size portion for your money. I didn't expect the bag to be so heavy.  Now the flavor of the food was a welcomed surprise. Where most places are a bit heavy with the seasonings, I can gladly say that this was not. My chicken and fish were both fresh and delicately seasoned. The flavor of the meat stood out for me. This was a pleasant surprise. Hush puppies were crisp yet moist. Now the potato salad, was a slight disappointment. But when competing with my sister Lil'Bits potato salad, most others usually fall short. Yeah, I'm completely biased. Sue me. Now, Da MacNCheese is one of the best I have had here in Charlotte. Somebody's Grandmomma did a lip smack in good job with this batch. Remember what I said about portions, I got a double portion. I guess they don't believe in wasting plate space. That was a happy lil surprise for me. I also got a peach cobbler for dessert. Not the best I've had, but the crust is flaky, it isn't too sweet. In fact it is pretty good.  I took off one star only because of the dinning room. There is no real organization. For carry out, I HIGHLY recommend giving them a try. I know I will become a regular. But, I don't see myself dining in, at least not at this location.",

While I was waiting 10 minutes for the fish to be cooked freshly I noticed the grade 92 and looked around the floors and tables were dirty. Anyway got my food to go. The fish was seasoned just right!!! The Mac and cheese was mushy with overcooked pasta and a offbrand cheap cheese not like I expected. The potato salad was cold and you could taste th garlic. Pretty goodn . it came with brick I mean cornbread.LOL it had no flavor and didn't taste like Jiffy cornbread. No sweet just tasted like a brick I took 1 bite and through it away. The coconut cake looked very appealing until I took the first bite. It was stale and taste like 2 day old cake not moisture at all. I was disappointed in the cake. If I come back again I will only.get fish!!! You can get it bake broiled or fried. Why was there no hour rush?!?! Oh now I know why.",

I like the strawberry cake, but don't go here much because I don't know who I'll have to deal with when I'm there. The young lady that works the register with glasses is really nice. I talked with a young man on the phone to make sure they had strawberry cake before going & he was really nice also. He even volunteered to call me back & let me know when the lady that makes the cakes arrived, but the others...I just can't. After I paid for my cake the young lady told an older lady that was going from the front to back that she needed 2 slices of strawberry cake. She said we do have some right? The lady looks at me & says \"yes, but I wasn't planning on cutting it\". Then she proceeds to talk to a young man at the counter and after few seconds, says \"you want 2 pieces of strawberry cake\"? I mean mugged her just like she was looking me & said yes...silence...so I say thank you. She responds umhuh. I haven't been here in ~4 months because of scenes like this and that's normally how I space my visits. I don't have as much time to bake as I used to but I think I'm just going to figure out how to make a similar cake because I'm a stickler for good customer service. The food is ok but that's why I don't purchase it. I'm not giving them that much money. I don't understand this kind of service when I'm paying you. I work hard for my money & just prefer to spend it at places where they seem to appreciate my business.",

I've tried the fish and chicken and a few sides and everything was just alright....perhaps my expectations are too high, but I will try them once more.  I think if they focused more on the seafood it would be a little better but they're basically a soul food restaurant that sells fish and shrimp.",

It took about 40 minutes to get our food and there were still some items missing. My parents said the oxtail was mediocre and I had the fried oysters which weren't too bad. Chicken livers were dry. Cabbage was salty and bland at the same dang time(???) And the cake tasted boxed but it wasn't bad. I would go again for comparison knowing what I know now but my one year old son didn't dance and hum while he was eating so I think he's over it.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Sunset Soul Food, I usually try to stop in at least every two weeks.  For some reason, I just can't get enough of their desserts.  The chocolate cake, peach cobbler and sweet potato pie are all to die for.  I'm not a huge fried seafood eater; so I can't really comment on their seafood, but to date I haven't been disappointed with anything I've eaten here.  I was even brave enough to give their chitterlings a try and I was pleasantly surprised :)  To my knowledge most of the fried items are cooked to order; so if you're getting something fried, I would plan on around a 20+ minute wait.  The overall restaurant is rather small; if memory serves me correctly they only have about 4 tables and a few seats along the wall near a pub shelf.  I typically get take out, and I wouldn't recommend taking a large group (5+) to dine in.  One interesting thing about this place, is that they also cook Thanksgiving and Christmas turkey dinners.  I've had them do my Thanksgiving dinner for 2 years in a row now and my friends have always been impressed with the meal.  The pricing is fairly reasonable to, if I remember correctly a turkey, with 3 sides, rolls, gravy and a pie run around $69.  Customer service wise, the staff is friendly and fairly attentive.",

    "text": "I ordered on postmates. This was my 1st time using the app. I had a taste for fried ckn and  this place was closest at the time we ordered. Ordered the food, when it came we had 3 dinner rolls instead of cornbread like we ordered. So I called the store. The woman that answered seemed a little tudy but it was the end of the night so i let it pass. She said to call after I made my next order and she would give me 3 cornbread. The chicken I loved, the whiting not so much,the mac n ch was pretty good, didn't like the slaw. My family didn't like the food at all. The next day I just so happened to be in that area so I stopped in to get more ckn wings and the cornbread she said she would give me. The 2 women at the front weren't very welcoming at all. I ordered my ckn then mentioned the night before  (and it was her that  I spoke with). She just looked at me with this attitude like ok so! Then she said \"I'll put it in the bag\". She said 10-15 min so I sat in my car because it was really crowded. 15 min later I go back in, I'm standing in the front by the dessert fridge. I'm just watching and waiting for my food. I'm not the only one who got attitude, other customers were experiencing the same thing.   I must have stood there for about 10 or 15 more min. She looked at me a few times never said anything.  Then after she helps all the customers in line, she looks at me and says \"here you go, I called your number\". I took the bag and said thank you, got no response! I didn't appreciate the  service and then she only gave me 2 cornbread lol.",

The Mac n cheese needs cheese. My cabbage had been scorched. The fish was frozen I know its not fresh but it tasted frozen. These are the basics. I understand that this is the south but we need southern soul food to raise the bar and not accept anything. I am being generous with 2  stars.",

    "text": "I was lured into Sunset by a yelp coupon, and it was so good, I went like 4-5 times in the next three weeks. The collard greens are REALLY good. Not all porky, or vinegary, or salty. (no clue what they season them with, so I can't promise it isn't pork, just none in the greens.) Whatever it is, it's bangin. Same with the mac and cheese. Also the cornbread is sweet and good. I also endorse the yams.  That said, I have to knock off a star. The fried flounder is good, but not great. But the tarter sauce that comes with it however is disgusting. The mashed potatoes are only okay. The ambiance is lacking, BUT they always have Soul Train on from back in the day, which makes me nostalgic. But, I've picked up food maybe... 8 times, and my order has been wrong a couple of times. Once, I ordered and got home to find I had a roll (def not fresh) instead of their amazing fresh cornbread. People. I wanted my cornbread. (yes, it's that serious.) Not pleased. Apparently, they ran out and just gave me a roll instead but didn't tell me when I ordered or picked up. To their credit, I called and let them know I was disappointed, and the next time I got an \"extra\" cornbread. (woo!) Another time, I got green beans instead of collard greens. You know that's not okay, because I told you how I feel about the collard greens. I called and next time, I got my \"extra\" collard greens. But then the cornbread was wack. It was just mealy and thin, like it didn't rise. It's been the business every other time, so I'll just assume someone forgot the baking soda and move on. It happens to the best of us.  All around, good, and I recommend, but sometimes they make mistakes- unfortunately, a bit more often than they should. They do make it right but they lose a star because of it. Give them a try, but double check your order before you leave!",
