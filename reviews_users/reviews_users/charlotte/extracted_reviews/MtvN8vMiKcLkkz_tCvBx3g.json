    "text": "I went here for lunch with a couple of coworkers because we saw their $8.99 lunch special.  It was well advertised, and they got us to go.  The $8.99 special comes with a choice of Cesar or mixed house salad, choice of pasta (from 4 choices), and a dessert (with no choice).  They also serve complimentary bread in the beginning which is always nice.  SO the funny thing is that they serve all 3 portions (salad, pasta, and dessert) all on the same plate!  It was cool in a way, BUT the portions were way too small.  So i had to eat extra bread to feel full!    I got ordered:   House salad: I got the balsamic dressing (FYI, this was a thicker kind of balsamic dressing) everything about the salad was acceptable.    Penne Vodka pasta:  It was very good, but the portion was too small.    Cheesecake:  I am not sure everyday it is cheesecake for the lunch special.  It was great cheesecake, but once again a very tiny portion.   I am not holding them against their tiny portions for their lunch special because we took a risk to try it.  The one thing that brought them down to 3 stars was their lack of service for refilling our sweet teas, and bringing our check just very slow during lunch time.  Other then that I would definitely go back for the normal large portions of food!  ENJOY!",

The atmosphere was welcoming and cozy.  Our server Mariah was excellent. She knew the menu and how to handle my complicated order. She recommended great suggestions for both food and wine and was able to enlighten me on the things I did not know. I would rate her a 10 because of her personality as well as service. The food was great, the wine was a perfect pair and I left as happy as I could be. Highly recommend",

The pasta was hardly warm & again very small portions of 3 pasta dishes - lasagna was good - the penne was ok & the other dish was ok as well but again it was barely warm & with needing to be on time for our show we didn't send them back- the bread was cold - no butter - the dinner included dessert which was one cannoli - not a good deal at all & for 45.00 for one small salad - scant portions of pasta & one cannoli -I consider it a rip off ! We won't be back - much better restaurants to choose from using in the uptown area. Our waiter was very impatient with us when we were deciding on a wine & again when choosing our pastas- he needs a different job",

My husband ordered takeout here practically weekday and they get his order wrong often, even though it's almost always the same order - forgot trout, wrong pasta, no beans, no dressing! He continued to go out of convenience because of proximity to the office, but after his last experience, he will never Aria again. When he arrived at the restaurant for pick up, he gave them his name and they gave him the bag and bill. On that day, he went straight home and then discovered they handed him the wrong order. He calls the restaurant and informs them of the mistake. The manager, Dennis, gets on the phone and tells My husband the runner said he confirmed the order with my husband prior to ringing him up - not the case. If it was the case, my husband would have seen it was the wrong order altogether. Either the runner lied or the manager was executing poor customer service by blaming the repeat customer. The manager continues to place the blame on my husband and then says, \"You took off with the wrong bag.\" I was baffled hearing this conversation on speaker. After my husband made his frustrations very clear, the manager offered to refund the order, but wasn't even sure how to do it efficiently. At that point my husband said forget it and stated he will never go back again. Hasn't been back since!  Food has been decent (not as good as la toscana or Luce or Oggi), but the service and inaccuracies negate all of that!",

The caprese is kind of a deconstructed plate but it didn't make it any less good. I loved the basil and the buratta. My co worker had the trout and loved it as well. Bread is served before dinner with a bean salad instead of butter or a dip (different idea but it was ok.) The concept of this restaurant is to provide a casual environment which I absolutely loved but, wine was served in a low ball type glass and wine should always be served in a wine glass. Overall, a great experience and looking forward to it again! Staff was friendly, welcoming and provided some great recommendations for our trip!",

The carmelized gnocchi is outstanding, the sliders range from very good to delicious, (flavors rotate often,) and the wild mushroom goat cheese pizza has tons of flavor!   The calamari are not as good as some which I've had, and the rings are very small.   Not a fan of the desserts, but I like supersweet desserts, and none of theirs are.  A great place to come with friends, family, or for a romantic dinner.  Even though the setting is upscale the environment is casual. Staff ranges from helpful to helpfully friendly, and valet eliminates the uptown parking headache.",

The food is always delicious and the unique wine selection is impressive.   You can get away with dolling up or dressing casually...great ambience!  The bartenders are sweethearts and make incredible Moscow Mules (in copper mugs).  Look for the daily wine glass selection - it's probably something unique and wonderful!  Meals start with warm, fresh bread with a white bean, garlic, and olive oil dip.  Try the Lamb Pappardelle!  It's my go-to and never disappoints.   Beyond the dinner menu, they offer a Bar Bites selection of small plates.  A few of these with friends (or solo) will fill you up while you enjoy the bar.  I've been here when they've had great live music (acoustic guitar and singing).   ...and they have Gentlemen Jack!",

Then penne a la vodka as my entree which was equally as amazing! But the best part of the meal was the marscapone cheesecake which was absolutely phenomenal! For drinks I had a derby day which was a whiskey mixed with earl grey which was really good, and a glass of the Cielo Pinot noir. The only complaint I have is the waiter that we had, I know no one is perfect but my friend and I felt rushed, he took plates away from us when we weren't even finished and brought out our checks while we were still eating dessert. We were going to order another round of drinks but felt as if we were getting kicked out, it wasn't busy or close to closing either. I don't think that this is a reflection on the staff as a whole at all but it did put a damper on our experience!",

    "text": "I've been here for lunch several times and I tend to bring business partners here for working lunches. With that said, today I dined at Aria with a peer and from the moment the waiter (a young male with dark hair) was pushing appetizers to us. I get that waiters should update but his delivery made me uncomfortable. He kept saying let me get this [insert appetizer here] started, the gnocchi for the table I'll get that started. It's lunch dude, not an evening dinner where diners linger, slow down. After the strong appetizer push we order. The table received no bread, oil or toppings which is inconsistent service. It's one of the reasons I come to this place. My salad came, which has become my favorite and it had a weird topping on it (fluffy white stuff, I picked it off) that I didn't see last week when I ordered it. Before I could finish the lunch entree, the waiter is pushing the desserts just as hard as the appetizers. I kindly said no and he pushed to wrap it up to go. I assume from my waitressing days that lunch time is a low tipping shift and up selling is encouraged but probably unsuccessful  but this guy was relentless. I believe in second chances so I will return to Aria but if I get this waiter again, I might just leave.",

    "text": "Grabbed some dinner to go here after arriving in Charlotte a bit after most restaurants close (so early relative to New York!). Decided to order the Spiced Pork Belly and Pear & Goat Cheese Salad. After just 10 minutes, my food was done. True to Southern hospitality, the whole staff was incredibly kind.  The food however was just okay. The Spiced Pork Belly was a bit bland (maybe because I am used to Asian-style pork belly) and the brussel sprouts could have used a little more flavor. The Pear & Goat Cheese Salad was equally unimpressive, though they did give a lot of it as just an appetizer. I tend to prefer fresher pears in my salad and the pears here had been marinated for longer or something. The goat cheese was a bit too much to my taste, but I did enjoy the nuts and tangy dressing. Winner of the meal goes to the massive chunk of bread, which I was planning on not eating, but after taking a bite, finished almost all of it. It was still warm and soft on the inside with a crunchy crust. Delicious!  Nothing out of the ordinary about Aria, but if I happen to need a late dinner with friendly service in Charlotte again, I'd stop by and possibly try some of the entrees that my fellow Yelpers are raving about.",

    "text": "Paul's Yelp Elite Rating: 4.25 Stars  Yet another excellent lunch at Aria. My co-worker recommended their Burger. I said, \"Burger, at Aria?\" Well low and behold they DO have a burger, and my God is it DAMNED GOOD!!! It's called the \"Aria Burger\" and sure enough it is on the menu.  Like most people who go for lunch, Aria has a great lunch special where they offer 3 courses for under $10 (usually). And that's typically what I've gotten....or, some of their traditional Italian fare, just not a Burger.  But my oh my, their Aria Burger is at least a good 1/2 pounds of freshly ground meat (don't know the blend), with Carmelized Onions, Mushrooms, Applewood Bacon, Cheddar Cheese and a Fried Egg with Truffled Aioli. I mean, how can this NOT be delicious? Oh, and mine also had some fresh Thyme in there because I could definitely taste the herb (which was yummy).  They prepare the meat however you want it, even rare if you dared. But I like my Burgers perfectly medium and it came out perfectly medium. This was a VERY JUICY burger, and it dripped all over my hands (the way I like it)! Hell my only criticism is that they should bring out those \"hot towels\" like they do in many Japanese steak houses to get that burger juice off you. But hey, I'm just nit picking. And parts of my burger's bun were a TAD hard/chewy.  But overall this is definitely one of THE BEST BURGERS in Uptown! I'm glad I listened to my colleague (who I normally do NOT listen to by the way - LOL). Well he was 1000% RIGHT on that call!  Definitely a Thumbs UP, especially for a great lunch!",

The dining area is beautiful. The rather large bar area is very upscale and hopping. The service is fast, not rushed but fast. The wine list is extensive and offers a large number of reds.   A very nice touch is the large chilled bottle of water that is brought to the table. It's Charlotte tap water in an unmarked bottle but it is a better option than the typical glass of ice water. It's just a nicely-thought-out small touch.  One last mention about the veal. So often you will find veal that is just so-so. The veal at Aria was the best that I have eaten. It was soft enough to cut with a fork. Served with a delicious lemon butter and with capers. Just great!  The kitchen is visible through a large window that runs across the back of the dining room. The cooking space is first class. The chefs are neatly dressed and move with precision and grace.",

For such a very big table, I was BAFFLED that there was only one waiter, but he did a spectacular job!  We felt like everything came out in a timely manner!  I had two drinks; \"The peel\" and the \"DSL\"... both were creative and delicious, but the peel was more grapefruit juice than cocktail... so I'm not sure the $8-10 pricetag was warranted for something that fit into a champagne flute.  The arugula and pear salad was delightful and the Scottish salmon was buttery and perfectly cooked!  I cannot say enough about how lovely the food was!  All in all - I paid just about $55 for two drinks, a salad, my meal, and a generous tip.  I don't think it's too much for a nice night out!  Compared to some of the other \"upscale\" restaurants in uptown Charlotte, I'd say you could do MUCH worse than a visit to Aria.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would go again!",

So much so we are planning to return this week while in town for work just for drinks and dessert.  Update 4/17: was in town for 5 days and this is my 4th trip. 3 were just for tiramisu and drinks. I will miss it.  Update 6/2/15: back in town for a day and this was my first stop. It's notable that I watched the bartender pour a shaken drink and then top it off with liquor like she was supposed to instead of ice. Nice to know you get the drink you pay for.  Update 12/5/2015: It's a sad day indeed. I no longer work for the employer who regularly flew me to Charlotte and what I will miss most about working for them is being able to come to Aria for Tiramisu. I literally almost shed a tear. Farewell, sweet Aria. If you are reading this, have a Tiramisu for me and tell them it's in memory of an old friend.",

    "text": "I feel that Aria is often overlooked...it's the restaurant that you pass by, hear about and have good intentions of going but never/rarely make it there. Well tonight I made it there. There was an event being held for a nonprofit in the Bubble Room (which is a small but beautiful space) and my experience was so-so. Although the event benefited the nonprofit and there were a small amount of volunteers floating about it did not seem that Aria was equipped to handle such a large group. At one point I could not even find a napkin--and I did ask! During the event there were passed appetizers and they were pretty tasty. I also had a glass of champagne that delicious. I am intrigued to come back for an entree but the only thing holding me back is the sub par customer service.",

We started with the tuna and I'm not a fan of sushi but it was so good and they served it on a salt board. He had the prime rib which was cooked to perfection while I had the pork chops which were so delicious and tender. There are so many other dishes I want to try like the Beef Short Ribs and Fettuccine Carbonara. We will hopefully get back here soon!",

We also loved the attentive service. Coming from NY, the prices seemed very reasonable for what is an upscale italian restaurant.",

    "text": "Oh Aria I might have set my expectations a bit too high for you during restaurant week. They weren't terribly booked or busy when I went in on Thursday with my friends but we still got ignored for quite a good while by the hostess. It's not like we looked like bums or anything everyone was dressed up for a nice night out and were excited, we had even made reservations so it was slightly upsetting to get walked by without even a greeting when we walked in.  Hostess aside after we got seated the servers were quite competent and explained that the whole menu was available to order from during restaurant week. Awesome! The ice cold bean spread they serve with the bread while you peruse the menu is blech, I ended up just putting some olive oil on my plate and dipping it in that with some salt and pepper. I started with the caramelized gnocchi, delicious! Slightly crisp on the outside and just a hint of char from the caramelization. The Osso Bucco followed up but failed to deliver and actually kind of disappointed me a bit. Way overcooked, too much acid in the layer of chard underneath, but the polenta was nice and creamy, rich and flavorful I wish there was more of it. Hearing great things about the chocolate hazelnut cake, I decided to go for it. Well it was a bit too sweet for me and pretty average on my cake scale to be honest. Going with four people I also got to try out a lot of stuff that my friends ordered. I'd stay away from the crab cake, lots of crab but it didn't taste fresh at all more fishy. I think the way they pace meals was quite perfect, courses were brought out in a timely manner which doesn't always happen during crw so I appreciate that.  The ambiance here is quite wonderful, the food seems to be hit or miss which is not quite acceptable to me considering the prices you'll be paying here. I might go here on a whim again sometime. Hopefully they'll have less snotty hostesses and some of the kinks worked out in the food because I really want to like this place more.",

It seemed to get a little crowded after a Bobcats game let out later on, but it was fine.  The service was without any problems, unlike many of the reviews here.  Of course, we were at a table not at the bar.  It is a bit trendy, but not unbearably so.  The food is good.  I loved the warm ciabatta type roll that came out first, with some olive oil and pepper it was a great appetizer.  We also had the fritti mixti.  I had originally asked about the 5 dollar bar bites, but evidently they are only available at the bar.  The mixti was fine, but nothing special for 12 dollars.  We had two glasses of wine, which sort of bizarrely arrived in normal tumbler style glasses rather than wine glasses.  I didn`t really care, but it was a first for me.  For an entree I had the sausage, broccoli rabe and orrechiette, with a very strong garlic flavor (plus in my book) and a good bit of spice.  I have dairy issues, so it would have been nice if they had listed the cheese in the ingredients on the menu.  Nonetheless, it was flavorful.  My wife had the bucatini with pesto which she also like quite a good deal.    We had a good meal, but I don`t think that we will be back.  It is a bit costly for what they offer, and it is definitely too trendy for us.  It looks like it is trying to attract an epicenter crowd.",

The cauliflower soup was silky and delicate with interesting flavors, the lamb shank was so  incredibly delicious and flavorful, the desserts were AMAZING- blueberry upside down cake was warm, yummy soft cake with local blueberrys and ice cream, the almond brittle cheesecake was so good!. I didn't think you could make a cheesecake interesting but they did it, so kudos!  But my favorite was the scallops.  They combined it with a fabulous puree, young flavorful peas, butter beans some sort of jam.... and they were cooked perfectly- nicely seared and just barely crisp on the outside.

They gave us glass tumblers to drink our red wine with. And once we were served our food, the server never came back to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else until it was time to pay the bill. We were all Asians and we felt that we were discriminated against.  We were treated like second class citizens. Everybody else in the restaurant were served with wine glasses and were given attention except for our table.  I contacted the restaurant via their website and filed a complaint and never heard back from them.  The food wasn't even good. I've eaten seafood dishes in Italy and the seafood that this restaurant served was awful.",

I'm a huuuuge wine personal I absolutely loved it!   I got the penne ala vodka and I have never had this dish prepared the way it is at Aria and boy, is it delicious! It definitely has a different faster than most penne ala vodkas but it is sooo good. I think it's a lighter dish than normal which makes it nice. You don't feel as full but it's just as good!   My friend got a risotto which is pictured below. I can't remember the name, but that was just as good. Definitely a lot heavier than my dish but delicious, if you love cheese, get it!

    "text": "I wanted to love this place since its got a great spot uptown and great ambiance inside! Sadly, this restaurant lacks the higher end food service and flavors of newer surrounding restaurants.   I started with the Aria Caesar, which is listed as a romaine and kale blend. It came out as just romaine with some random sprigs of arugula. It needed the kale to add some crunch to differentiate the salad from the Caesar salad at a fast casual chain restaurant.   For the main dish I ordered the Pasta al Nero. It was doused in sauce to cover up a poor tasting noodle. The shrimp on the pasta was great. Portion was small.   Our dessert took ~30 minutes to come out... kind of frustrating when you just ordered a gelato... just scoop it out of the carton and bring it out please. When we let our waiter know how long we had waited, he said it was coming soon, and then walked away to continue to serve his other tables. Never went to the kitchen to check on or dessert. Finally came out 15 minutes later.   The server seemed pretty inexperienced, he would always forget to bring out drinks out.. the bartender/ some sort of manager would bring them over because they sat on the bar for too long.   In summary, if you go here for dinner, you won't have a bad experience, but you won't have a great one either. With so many new spots opening up uptown you don't need to settle for average at this price point.",

For my third anniversary with my fiance we asked for my favorite table, half way yo the stairs. They let us know they no longer had a table there but would set it up for us! Who does that anymore. You can't get service like that. Not only was the service amazing but the food was even better. We tasted as much as we could in the menu and would not have changed our decisions. The manager came to our table and didn't give the whole break down of \"I'm the manager, how's the service\". He talked to us and joked with us. I saw him continuously helping through out the night and that honestly is hard to find anymore. I will forever keep coming back here and am beyond impressed forever with this restaurant. Fantastic job!",

They said they were very busy, and I indicated we would be happy to wait as long as needed for a table and asked if we should come, or go elsewhere instead. I was told we should come and that would be fine. I indicated two of us would be there within half an hour.   Otherwise we would have gone somewhere else and this never would have happened.  When we showed up 20 minutes later, we valet parked and went in. There I was told they were busy. I said again we knew, I had spoken to the hostess (clearly the same person) and we would be happy to wait a long time. I think a manager was there next to her, and he repeated \"we're busy\". It was really weird. Eventually I got the picture! It was like they wouldn't admit out loud they were turning us away. Very strange and so rude. The hostess looked uncomfortable and the manager next to her was just hostile. The valets didn't know it was that \"busy\" either otherwise they would not have parked our car.   Honestly the hostility turned us off so much more than them being full. Definitely don't want to interact with staff again, there are equal or better restaurants for the price. We won't be returning.",

Picked up some of the seasonal cocktails at the bar while we waited for them to set up the table. Basil and berry mojito and a yummy smoky rendition of a margarita .  BUT, then we sat down. The restaurant was pretty empty for a Friday night. No other tables were really taking his time but it still took him forever to take the drink orders. He kept talking about bringing us bread after taking our orders but that never happened. Some of the girls ordered salad as an appetizer. Didn't receive that either.   The gnocchi with lamb bolognese was delicious but the serving size was pretty tiny. All in all not the worst experience but I wouldn't recommend it for a nice dinner out!",

After arriving we were seated upstairs and brought water, bread and their cannellini beans spread.  I have had the spread before and unfortunately this time it was very dry, missing some of the freshness of the beans, but the bread was on point.  After browsing the menu I decided to try the Pepperoni Pizza and my friend ordered the Tomato Basil Soup and a kids grilled cheese, since she was craving a grilled cheese with her soup and they did not offer that on the main lunch menu. The Pepperoni Pizza is described with crushed tomatoes, bacon, onion and ricotta. Let me first say the dough was cooked perfectly, a thin dough with a light and fluffy crust.  However, it should have been described as an onion pizza. Maybe it was the order I received but I picked forks full of onions off the pizza as it took away from the flavor of the pepperoni and cheese, which is what I really wanted to enjoy. Service overall wasn't on point and I definitely didn't think the lunch menu lived up to what I expected.  I will definitely go back for drinks and think about giving them another shot for lunch and/or dinner.",

I ordered spaghetti and meatballs expecting to get more food because well it's spaghetti and meatballs why would you be so cheap with the noodles in the sauce but all in all it was a nice experience but I'll be sticking to my commercial Italian restaurants bring on the Carrabba's and the Olive Garden at  least I get to go home with leftovers to eat the next day..",

Having just had some pretty heavy apps at another place, we were drawn in by the $5 Bar Bites menu to continue the apps-evening, but ended up going a different route once we came in.  Welcoming!  Friendly!  Service-Oriented!  Everything that had been missing in the place we had just come from was right here.  We felt like welcome guests that their sole priority was to make sure we were happy and satisfied.  Wine:  Our Gal listened to my wants and let me try a couple so that I couldn't have been happier with my(her) selection.  Husband enjoyed a Sazerac, and we were brought some yummy bread with killer marinated beans.    Perusing the great-looking menu, I was in need of pasta, and Husband (smartly) decided to share and let me pick one (since we were only so hungry): Strozzapreti Shrimp, Pancetta, Roasted Tomatoes, Broccoli Pecorino, Toasted Garlic, Olive Oil  They were kind enough to split this for us, which is always appreciated.  Freshly grated cheese was offered (and happily accepted).  Wow, this pasta was so good!!  Pasta perfection!  Flavors perfectly balanced and executed.  Would love to have a big bowl of it right now, but sadly am a couple hours away.  My definition of a 5-star experience is one that could not possibly have been better.  Service, drinks, food, way they made us feel welcome...all added up to our one 5-star experience on this trip to Charlotte. Thank you hard-working Aria folks!  Note: had you been open on Sunday we would have been right back the next day!",

I did not try too many of the wines, I always get the same one that is not bad but I just have to get used drinking it in a water glass!

It's also a must-visit during Charlotte Restaurant Week because they include their full menu, and the food and service are just as good as any other time.  They have a lunch combo with a salad, entree, and dessert.  All are small portions but it's perfect for lunch.  I love their penne a la vodka and get it just about every time.   If you sit at the bar, they have a few options for appetizers that are not available in the dining room, like their pork belly.  I love the way Aria makes this dish, and it's well worth it to sit here at least once to try it!  Service at the bar is also excellent.   Some of our favorite entrees are the scallop/mushroom/artichoke risotto, the meat ragu pappardelle, and spaghetti and meatballs.  The scallop dish is one of my favorites at any Charlotte restaurant - it's literally BURSTING with flavor.   I'm not a big drinker, but their blueberry martinis are fantastic.  I usually get two and make my hubby drive home.  Aria is one of my favorite places for a nice dinner.  With consistently good food and service, I always leave full and happy.",

Unfortunately, this time Aria seemed to miss the mark.  With it being restaurant week, it was 3 for 30$ and included appetizer, main and dessert.  I do like that Aria offers basically their whole menu during restaurant week, since most other places have only a few choices.  I had the mushroom pizza, scallop risotto and mascarpone cheesecake.  2 out of 3 very good and flavorful, but the scallop risotto was a disappointment as it was bland and not up to par with other risotto's that I have had in the past.  Now, I am not really a fan of cheesecake, but this one really hit the spot, and the mushroom pizza was as tasty as the last time that i had it.  The restaurant has a fairly boisterous atmosphere, so don't go here if you want a quiet, romantic dinner.  There was live music on this evening, which was good, but it was drowned out by the full dinning room chatter.  As I mentioned, this was my second visit here and I would rate that visit at 4 and 1/2 to 5 stars.  This one rates only 3 mainly due to the service, which was spotty at best.  It seemed that we were bothering our server whenever she came over.  It was the second night of restaurant week, but she seemed to be hoping that the week ended soon.  Don't get me wrong, I will probably return.  I just need to figure out a good day to go when they are less slammed, like a week day.",

I mean, it is a national holiday for me.  So after some negotiation, someone suggested Aria, and I love trying new places, so I was all-in.    We got there early (around 11:30, which is the perfect time for uptown lunch, btw), and were seated at the table by the kitchen, which  was actually kind of annoying (we were basically in a room with one entrance besides the entrance to the kitchen, with no room for the server to move behind our chairs).  No big deal, though, and it was interesting to see the chefs at work.  The menu for lunch was pretty extensive and there were a lot of choices.  They even had a lunch deal that was pretty reasonable (and included dessert!).  I opted for a lamb salad with butter beans and some other delicious stuff on it, and it was awesome.  I always jump at the chance to order lamb, because it's rare that I eat somewhere that has it, and I love it soooooo much (baaaaaaaaaaa).  Salad was a pretty decent portion, but that doesn't mean I didn't almost lick the plate clean.  A lot of the others in our group got salads of all different kinds, and they all enjoyed their lunches thoroughly (although I may be the only plate licker... lay off me, I'm starving).  I would love to try Aria out for dinner and maybe sample some wines!  I'll definitely be back :)",

Unfortunately my Parents who rarely go out and treat themselves were very excited to dine at Aria before their long anticipated Johnny Mathis concert. They had a wonderful meal until desert when my father bit into something hard.  He removed it from his mouth and realized there was an old crown from someone's mouth in his cheesecake.   He showed it to my mother and then went to the men's room where he proceeded to vomit his meal. My dad still very upset about what transpired said he may call the police ( people say things when they're upset or angry ). My Parents are older and were very upset. Unortunately the owner in his 30's towering over my father started screaming at them, embarrassing and humiliating them in front of the the other diners accusing them of planting the crown. Screaming at them to exit the restaurant while my father was trying to explain what happened and why he was upset. He would not listen! They still went to the concert that they have been looking forward to for months. My mom said the whole time my father was so upset and didn't enjoy himself. My parents are very proud and to make them feel like con artists that carry an old disgusting crown in their pocket to get free meals is disgusting. They weren't looking for a free meal just some empathy for what happened. My father then tried to tip the server who was wonderful and very kind. The owner took the tip from him and made my dad take it back.   I called today to speak to the owner about how hurt and disappointed we we are.  He was nothing but rude, obnoxious, arrogant and would not listen to me. As an owner of a restaurant you would think even if a mention of the police he would try and resolve the matter instead of being cruel and humiliating to my parents.   I have to vent because my parents are such good people who do not get out often, work very hard and help with my kids. He should have had some compassion instead of being a jerk. NOTE TO OBNOXIOUS OWNER- GET OVER YOURSELF",

And only $5, what a steal! 2) Bar bites-short ribs: the beef seriously was just falling apart it was so tender! And only $5, what a steal! It was a very small portion, but totally worth it! 3) Squash Ravioli: Very tasty! Loved the squash stuffing and the ravioli skin was very well made! 4) prosciutto flatbread: LOVED IT!!! YUMMY!! 10inx10in of happiness on a platter! The cheese was thin and not overbearing, the toppings were delicious and the flatbread crust was very well made! PERFECTION!  Service:  Very friendly! Very good about refilling our water and attending to our needs!   Ambiance:  Very hip and trendy feel! There is a little bar off to the side with a LARGE selection of wines! Very nice place for a classy hangout joint! The restaurant side was very well decorated with modern decor! It had a more romantically dimmed lite setting but very appropriate for the theme they were setting! I loved it!   Price:  It's going to put a dent in your wallet but it's well worth it! The food is delicious, the service is great and the ambiance is really worth experiencing! I'd totally recommend this for a splurge or a nice date!  Overall:  I would LOVE to come back again but too bad I'm not from the East Coast and I don't live in Charlotte, North Carolina :(",

They gave bread and olive oil, which is always tasty.  I ordered the tuscan salad which consisted of arugula, beets, shaved fennel, red onion, endive, ricotta salata and a walnut vinaigrette, I loved this, very simple and the portion was just right.  For my main course, I had the lasagna, I really liked the sauce and it was a generous portion. My colleagues liked their entrees. One had the penne with meatballs and the other had the seafood pasta.  All in all, nice place, good food and good service.",

    "text": "I call this review, High Hopes and Bubble Nightmares.   I too went to a benefit here, which is completely separate to how in feel about the Bubble Lounge. The organization I was there supporting, couldn't be nicer...but the lounge needs some serious work.   Having it be part of Aria, you know it's going to be trendy.  The circular bar is nicely set up, as is the rest of the lounge. The finishes are rich and it feels modern and sleek.    The problem my friends and I had was the service, or lack of it. We waited a good, 10, 15 minutes at the bar, and watched as the staff served champagne to the other ladies around us, but ignored us as we BLATANTLY HELD OUT OUR HANDS WITH DRINK TICKETS. It was almost like being in middle school again.  Ignored by the cool kids.   When passed apps came around, that's what they did.  The servers with trays walked around, and didn't stop at our section of the bar.  When FINALLY a tray of mini crabcakes was set down, we each took one, and immediately, the server took it back.    There were also no napkins passed at this time, so my friend and I at one point were left with a skewer of lamb...and left the sticky skewer on the bar.  Classy.   The passed coconut shrimp was ok...but reminded me of a soggier version of that Margaritaville frozen coconut shrimp in the supermarket freezer section.   The creme de la creme...  I was sitting at the bar chair, and when the phyllo-wrapped asparagus came around, I stood up (butt still touching the seat of the chair) to get one. I felt something behind me, almost sat down, but REALIZED THERE WAS NO CHAIR UNDER ME!   A woman had taken it from under my bottom!  I looked over her, asked her why she did it, and she, along with her smug boyfriend/manfriend said \"you stood up, so it's mine\". (Or something to that extent.)   The manfriend then proceeded to hug the bartender who saw the entire situation go down.   One server was kind to us, but he was serving Aria, so we didn't deal with him much...which brings me to the conclusion the Bubble Lounge has some serving issues to deal with.    In my book, it's all about service.  I don't care who you are, you could be my grandma, a supermodel, a TV news anchor or unemployed.  If you don't serve everyone equally, you've lost my service.   I may try this place again...but it's going to take a lot of improvement.",

    "text": "Good gluten free dining option for the  menu savvy.  There is no separate gluten free menu, gluten free items are not designated on the menu and our waiter had no knowledge of what was and was not gluten free.  He was very willing to speak to the chef to find out :)  Our party of six dined here Wednesday night.  We were seated promptly.  Our waiter was friendly and efficient.  The dining room was somewhat loud but that was mostly due to our boisterous group!! Our appetizers consisted of the caramelized gnocchi (not gf), steamed mussels, and antipasto.   The steamed mussels were great, the gnocchi average and the antipasto not worth ordering again.  Our entrees were the Potato Gnocchi, Slate Grilled New york strip, Sausage Pizza, Chicken dish and the Osso Bucco.  According to our friends, the Pizza was really good and the chicken dish was fabulous.  The potato gnocchi (ordered by two diners) was average at best and not repeatable.  The new york strip was the least favorable of all the entrees our friend did not  care for it.  I ordered the Osso Bucco (deemed to be GF by the chef) and it was Out. Of. This. World.  Spot on flavor, falling off the bone, just absolutely FABULOUS. Deifnitely the best dish of our trip to Charlotte (after trips to Capital Grill, Dressler's and Bernardin's!).  For dessert our party ordered the Tiramisu, the Panna Cotta (deemed GF by the chef), and gelato over espresso.  All of these were good.  I really enjoyed the panna cotta!! It was a refreshing change from the usual GF option of Gelato when dining at Italian restaurants.  I must add the Limoncello after dinner drink here is PHENOMENAL.  They make it themselves and it is a MUST try.  We will definitely return to Aria on any subsequent trips to Charlotte.",

Granted it was the last night of restaurant week, but the service was pretty bad. Our waiter seemed distracted and had to ask us to repeat our order twice. Also my boyfriend ordered a second beer ( had first one at the bar) and he didn't get it until after the apps arrived. For apps we have the gnocchi which was VERY salty, and eggplant which was okay. For dinner I had the scallops which were over cooked and rubbery. My boyfriend got the ny strip, which looked more like a chuck steak when it arrived. Very thin and the color was not nice and browned. Had to wait almost 10 minutes for a wine refill, oh and they forgot to give us bread. Dessert was fine, but nothing spectacular. All in all a very disappointing experience and we will not be back.",

I found the food to be good, but it isn't anything authentic Italian. It is very americanized but at least they don't soak sauces in garlic. The gnocchi appetizer was okay, lacked gnocchi flavor, I could only taste the oil and some seasoning. The pasta carbonara was okay but very (VERY) greasy. I took some some and the next day it was terrible. It was a block of fat around pasta, terrible. I will never order it again! The panna cotta was pretty good, that's a good thing :). Other than that I disliked the way they serve the wine -- they serve wine in water cups (what?!) -- that pretty much destroy the wine tasting experience. They have a great wine selection but how can you get a good taste of wine in a water cup?! I wouldn't come back, as for Italian food I would go to Luce for a real Italian food.",

    "text": "This new addition to Charlotte did a great job in exceeding our expectations on a recent snowy night.   Aria serves Tuscan food in a contemporary environment, and I loved that the open bar with live music that kept us entertained for most of the night.   We had a reservation at 9 on a Friday night. Good thing- as this place was packed! The restaurant is below street level so we were able to peek in as we walked along the sidewalk to gauge where we wanted to sit before walking in.   Upon entering the front door, you are in a vibrant bar with a wall of wine from floor to ceiling. Glancing around, the open kitchen is the next thing to catch your eye and then you spy the seating area as the tables are filled with animated people all enjoying their food while listening to the live guitar music. I could have sat in the bar all night- but dinner was our goal!   We were seated immediately and began to look at the menu. Our server, Carolyn was great! She knew the menu inside and out and was able to make some great suggestions for us. And the patrons were friendly too, as we struck up a conversation with the couple next to us within minutes of sitting down (but that's another story for another time)   We began with the tuna carpaccio and the antipasto plate. The tuna came with asparagus and was terrific, and the antipasto? Gone in an instant but not before enjoying the salami, olives and cheeses.   We decided to split a pasta and and a couple of entrees so that we could taste a larger range of the menu. The penne pasta with ricotta and vodka tomato cream sauce was perfection on a plate (would it have been wrong of me to lick the dish?). And the lamb chops were so good I didn't want to share them so my friend enjoyed his veal scallopini in peace.  Dinner for two with drinks and wine came to about $130 which was great considering the quality of the food and the quantity of the drinks that we had. It was a great night out and the service was spot on. We walked to the restaurant but if you are driving- they do have complimentary valet parking and also validate for the Bank of America parking garage.   Aria may be a new addition to Charlotte- but they have none of the new restaurant blues that so many places experience. Unless, of course you count the blues being played in the lounge, but on the night we were here- those were just the kind of blues we wanted to hear!",

While i was less than enthused with my entree both of my friends loved theirs. We started our meal with the Calamari Fritti and was satisfied but not completely blown away. I was very excited when i saw they have wood fried pizza because that is always a fantastic dinner. I got the Margherita Pizza and was thoroughly disappointed. The crust was basically a cracker and the tomato sauce was just tomato paste with now seasoning. There was barely any mozzarella and basil so this was a solid C+ meal. My two friends were very happy with their meals. One of them got the Fettuccine Carbonaras and the other got the Pan Seared NC Trout. I got to try both and was very happy with each of them. The Fettuccine Cabonaras was super rich but not completely overwhelming. The trout was well cooked and a solid dish. I will definitely give Aria another shot but i will stay far away from the Pizza.",

Then we wait another 30 minutes for our food, which for one person came out incorrectly. I had the caprese panini, which was not that great - messy and hard to eat. I have had positive experiences with Aria in the past, but seems like things are slipping...",

Normally I opt for the ceaser salad but I was in the mood to try the white bean soup instead.  After a couple of bites in, I found a hair in the soup.  Gross right?  It happens though, however when it does, I expect some type of empathy and a gesture to show that you value my business.  Didn't get that from them today.  Didn't get it from the server, or the manager with the wrinkled shirt.  The meal was only 9 bucks...comp the meal bud, offer a gift card, OFFER SOMETHING...  This is a nice place with cloth napkins and salad forks.  I won't be back.  The server ruined the experience when she didn't even take the time to acknowledge the hair in the soup.  Nor did she offer more bread and put all of our checks on one ticket.  They weren't even busy for her to be so lazy....do better Aria and next time your staff comes in on a day they don't want to be there, do your patrons a favor and send them home for the day.  The guy with the cheese though...A1",

Our waiter was patient, informative and appropriately attentive. The eggplant parmigiana (dinner style) was good. The shrimp carbonara was also good. While the chicken parmigiana was as advertised, it ended up being a bit to crisp.",

Lucky was friendly, attentive, shared his history and worthy of all the success he may have in life. He even does magic tricks!!!! Keep an eye out for him he is going to be famous. Mark my words. Now on to the meal. We ordered the bruschetta with roasted red pepper and pickled mushrooms. Delicious! I suggest layering on the bread they give you with the cannelini beans they provide. We also ordered the gnocchi with the Gorgonzola cream, apple and prosciutto. This was perfection when eaten all Together. For dinner we had penne vodka with shrimp and i had the chicken cacciatore. Both were sublime. I also had a couple glasses of the prosecco and the live music was on point. A wonderful Saturday night. What can i say, aria hit the spot. It's s cozy little place and if you ask for lucky you are sure to have an amazing meal.",

    "text": "We seriously loved Aria. Let's start with the environment - the place is beautiful. The lighting is tasteful and fun. The bar is enormous, which is great for walk-ins. The open format allows for a relaxed but sumptuous atmosphere.   We sat at the bar, which was relatively empty considering it was 8pm on Saturday night (it was the night before Easter, so there were definitely a lot of folks out of town). We sat in the corner and started off with cocktails - a classic mojito and a lavender/vodka drink - both delicious. Their cocktails/wine/beer lists are all extensive and impressive. I probably would have tried any cocktail on the menu.  We skipped apps and just ordered entrees. We were given warm bread and traditional Italian white bean spread while we waited. I had pesto pasta, which was delicious. The pasta was fresh and the pesto was the perfect amount of nutty. My mom got the fancy steak (forgive me, as a vegetarian I don't remember the cut) and while she was disappointed at the size considering the price ($38 I believe), she said it was all delicious. We looked at the dessert menu but as chocolate lovers, nothing stuck out to us.   All in all, Aria is a great spot for those craving a fine-dining, NYC-esque experience. I will definitely be back, first for the cocktails, then for the food.",

    "text": "My husband and I ventured to Aria to try out their restaurant week menu. This was the second time we had visited Aria and after a great first experience there, we were excited to try it again. Unfortunately, the whole experience fell flat.   For starters, the service was mediocre at best. The hubby and I are pretty easy to please when it comes to service (and my other reviews attest to this) but it was pretty terrible on this particular evening. Our waiter seemed friendly enough at first (I can't remember his name, unfortunately) but it quickly became clear that he wasn't interested in serving us because of our age. We've had this happen a few times but it never gets old. Yes, my husband and I are in our mid- to late twenties but that does not mean that we aren't there to spend some money on a nice dinner. We are also great tippers if we are treated properly. The waiter was snippy with us and rarely checked on us. Our waters sat empty and I had to flag him down to ask for another drink (which took 20 minutes to come out and then wasn't made properly).   The food was also just mediocre. The chicken cacciatore was dry and lacking in the olives and mushrooms it was supposed to come with. All of our food just left us saying \"meh.\" We also had to gobble down our dessert as it took absolutely forever for them to come out for some reason and we were in a hurry to get to a show at Blumenthal (and yet, the older couple seated next to us received their drinks and dinner/dessert courses in a much more timely fashion...interesting). Needless to say, we won't be returning to Aria and we will recommend our friends stay away from it, as well. We will go to places that treat us well regardless of our age.  P.S. Aria, If I'm at a fine dining establishment don't insult me by carding me when I order a drink. I'm 28 years old and if I'm ordering a glass of wine or a particular cocktail, I think I know what I'm talking about.",

My coworkers and I came here today and we were seated right away (12:30pm), but the place was pretty packed.   We started with the ricotta bruschetta. It was served on a big loaf topped with Paesano, Ricotta, Speck Parmigiano, Mint and olive oil. It was really good, but I wish since we were sharing that it was served in individual pieces. Kind of weird to have bruschetta on one giant piece as it got messy cutting it up.   For lunch, most of us got the express lunch meal. For $8.99 you get a salad or soup, pasta (spaghetti with meatballs, carbonara, Penne vodka or penne with sausage) plus a piece of cheesecake. It was served bento box style and portion sizes were good. I actually got the chopped salmon salad. It was good but the olives and ham made it really salty. Not sure if I would get it again.   I would go back for lunch, especially for the lunch express deal. I wasn't blown away, but service was fast and the food was good. Plus, there aren't many places in Uptown where you can get lunch for less than $9.",

For dinner I ordered Grandma's lasagna which was a huge portion but again, good but not great.  The amount of Ricotta vs. the rest of the dish tended to overwhelm and dumb down some of the other flavors.

    "text": "I've always walked around Founder's Hall and seen the signs that adverise Aria's express lunch special.  My team and I were looking for a quick sit down lunch somewhere near the office, so we decided to stop by Aria, where there was no wait to be found (on the upstairs level).  We were seated and accommodated quickly by a nice waitress.  The express lunch is 3 courses - appetizer, main, and cheesecake and there's really not that many options to choose from.  If you're a vegetarian, you basically only have a choice of penne vodka for your main dish.  The express lunch comes served on a plate that is basically like a fancy ceramic bento box.  As for myself, I chose the roasted tomato bisque to start which was semi-warm, but had a pretty good flavor.  This might be a bit diva-like, but I thought having soup out of a square shaped bowl was weird.  The soup was probably the best out of the rest of the dishes in all honesty.  For my main, I got the Orecchiette with Sausage.... its not a red sauce-based dish, but rather oil and garlic.  It had a lot of flavor to it, but I'm not really a fan of oil-based pastas.  The serving size was just perfect.  Everyone raved about the cheesecake but I really was not a huge fan of it.  To each their own.  If you like basic Italian food and are looking for a quick, cheap, sit down meal in the Bank of America Corporate Center, 1BAC, or Founder's Hall, Aria is a good choice for convenience and value.  However, I think there are much better choices for lunch out there.",

We then had the orecchiette and lasagna, which were both delicious. I'd recommend the lasagna over the two. For dessert we had the cheesecake and chocolate hazelnut cake, which hit the spot. Highly recommend this place if you're craving some Italian in uptown Charlotte!",

The hostess finally walks up and was neither warm nor friendly, it was extraordinarily loud due to the live music. The singer was great but it seemed like an odd space for indie-soft rock music. Anyway, as we sat down the waiter was inattentive, never asked to refill our cocktails, never asked if our food was correct or tasty, never refilled our waters and quite frankly was disconnected. We ordered 2 different cocktails- one was watered down and the other was undrinkably strong. The food--the only thing that could have saved this review but sadly it was expensive and bland. I got the Rigatoni Vodka with chicken and it had 0 flavor, it was lukewarm, and I would have been much happier eating something else. Babe had the ravoli and she wasn't a fan--it didn't taste fresh, was also bland and lukewarm. All in all, we won't be back.   We love eating out so we hold things to a standard. The standard wasn't met. Save your money, and try something else in the area.",

We were baffled at the crowd, but the host sprang to action and offered us the only table available - the \"chef's table\" - right in the kitchen. A \"chef's table\"? In Charlotte? We jumped right on it.    I headed to our special table with visions of hibachi restaurants, with chefs putting on a show. I was certain that it would be just a few moments until my girlfriend's and I were catching shrimp in our mouths, tossed from the cooks while singing and cheering, flames in the backdrop. I recently read an article from Charlotte Magazine in which the author described the Chef's table as a \"small space off the dining room where they can enjoy dishes with commentary from the kitchen.\" Hmm. Commentary? At one point during dinner, one of my friends sneezed and I think - I think - one of the line cooks said \"Bless you.\" Other than that, we kind of felt like we were intruding, and within five minutes we were all sweating like a group of menopausal women.   Anyway, once we cracked the menu we forgot we were in the kitchen. Everything sounded delicious and, between the four of us, it's safe to say that no one's dish disappointed. We ordered the bruschetta and, as Stephen said, it wasn't what we had pictured but once the first bite was taken, nobody cared anymore. We also had the eggplant parmigiana, equally delish. The bread was pretty average, and the white bean dip that came with it took it up a few notches. For entrees, we ordered the Wild Mushroom Pizza (very good,) the potato gnocchi (tasty), and the butternut squash ravioli. This last dish was a bit sweet, but soooooooooo good - I was craving it again the next day.  Overall, great experience here. Again, I agree with Stephen that there is nothing that indicates it is a \"new\" restaurant in terms of quality and service.",

The folks at Denny's do a better job.  Our server was partially \"dain bread\".  He tried to memorize the specials of the day, but only could recall 80% of the menu.  His face was straining to recall how 2 of the dishes were prepared.  When I asked if had tried any of the dishes he quickly said no.  Go figure?     We ordered our wine by the glass, and the waiter walks away.  He comes back and tries to sell us a special $55 bottle of wine which he emphasized retails for $200.  Nothing else.  He proceeds to stand there and stare at us.   Strange.   Food came and we ate.   Dessert was not outstanding.  However, the gelato & sorbett was VERY tasty. Oh yeh.   Not surprisingly, the waiter couldn't remember all the flavors!!  Hilarious.",

Luckily I was not on a date so i can enjoy and breath all I want. We also split a tiramisu which very good one slice portion.   The service is a little weak, my water bottle was not refill until I stop one of the server that passing by. But that's all I can complain about... is my water.

Our table was ready upon arrival.  The atmosphere was great, modern, comfortable, live music included.  The menu was spectacular, not your average Italian menu.  I had a Cesar salad that was really top notch with anchovy halves.  My main course was New York strip, medium rare which was served with potato pancetta hash, doesn't sound great , but it was perfect and the steak was cooked perfectly.  Dessert was a well made and testy cheesecake.  First of all,  the food was perfect,  the wait staff was on the ball and nice.  Secondly, I can't wait to go back and try other dishes until I've tried them all.  Take your cash because it is pricey.  A date for two with meal and cocktails will run you at least $120 at the low end, $180 is probably about average.  Well worth it if you don't mind the cost.  You will not be disappointed.",

I sliced each gnocchi in half to savor the meal.  I somehow managed not to inhale the entire plate - a perfectly large lunch sized portion and had a small box to bring home.  Even reheated, the truffle oil filled the room and I was unable to grab even half a gnocchi before he had devoured the plate!",

Also we biked through the open table as instructed on their voicemail explaining it was an 18th anniversary, we got the table by the kitchen which was wide open and very loud, waiter wasn't aware.

The tomatos were fresh and the argula instead of basil was a nice touch. For my main, I got the Salmon dish. It was server with veggies and pesto couscous. The veggies were cut into very small pieces and tossed in a tomato sauce. All I could taste was the sauce and tasted no pesto in the couscous. The salmon was good but portion were very small.

Aria's lunch specials are nothing short of genius, three courses for about 9 dollars is always a steal in the center of uptown Charlotte, however I cannot get over the lack of service skills the staff of this restaurant have.  I walked in for lunch and was seated at an obviously dirty table by the hostess. After mentioning the state of my table, the hostess told us to get up and stand to the side to wait on our table to be cleaned. It then took about 20 mins for our drinks to get to our table and our water caraffe layed empty for most of our meal after we drank it all. In addition to the host's undone appearance, some of the servers themselves looked as if they just rolled out of bed. Not quite sure I appreciate being in an upscale restaurant with hungover, sloppy looking waitstaff.   I must say the Sausage Oricchiette was delicious, and every dinner I've had there was a home run food wise. Aria would be an automatic first choice for me if they tightened up the floor a bit.",

My friend got a salad with grilled salmon, and it was fresh and colorful.  The fresh bread and olive oil/bean spread is droolworthy.

I ordered the tiramisu and it was awful. It was on its side so the ingredients weren't able to absorb in each other. I took one bite and experienced immediate regret. It was super dry. The texture was awful and the flavor was off. It definitely tasted like instant chocolate pudding on punishment cake. A nice spot to take your enemies I guess. When the waiter came, he didn't ask how it was so I just said this is bad and handed it back to him. He walked away and brought me my bill. He did not offer to substitute  it or remove it from my bill even though it was untouched with the exception of the single bite I had to know I didn't want more. As someone who worked in the  service industry, to never ask someone how is there food is and treat them like their invisible is the best way to ruin a customer experience. Now I'm afraid to try the rest of what I ordered tomorrow. I'm hoping for a better experience. I'm someone who typically tips at least 30% unless the service is stellar than I go above and beyond how I feel but I felt so disappointed I wanted to leave nothing. This is the second time a \"fine dining\" charlotte restaurant has shocked me with poor service in 8 years. I'm such a foodie and eat everywhere, I'm so used to good service in the city, this felt terrible. The hostess was nice. I may update my review tomorrow after I try the entree in case it improves my opinion but for now 1 star because I can't give them zero.  Updating review to 3 starts because the lamb and salad was delicious the next day. Very good.",

Highly recommend the caramelized gnocchi with prosciutto and pear appetizer (can also be made into an entree). Also had the kale salad, mussels, and bruschetta. So so so yummy!",

    "text": "If you asked me for a list of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte, Aria would definitely crack the top 10. I've been here 3 or 4 times and am extremely happy with the food, service, atmosphere and consistency. My favorite dishes are the caprese salad, butternut squash ravioli and penne a la vodka. Their wine list is spectacular and, although I'm not a wine aficionado by any means, I really love the $6.50 glass of Chianti they offer. My boyfriend got the Bourbon Smash cocktail and said it was one of the best cocktails he's had.  I haven't been there for their happy hour, but they do have $5 bar bites available on weekdays. A lot of my friends say they go there after work and have nothing bad to say. I also would say this is a good place to go for after-dinner drinks or dessert and a coffee. Lastly, if you are going here on a date, try to get one of the seats in the corner- it is a good way to sit close to your date without being awkward and sitting on the same side of the table.",

We made reservations and were seated immediately, while our waitress never told us what her name was, she did made suggestions on her favorite things on the menu...didnt really go over anything special just said that it's what she always ordered so we should give it a try?!!? So I guess that makes up for it?!?!   Moving on...What I did really like was the atmosphere we sat right in front of the open kitchen and everyone back there looked like they were working like bad scientist so again I had high hopes on the meal...It was clean, organized and was a very nice touch to the restaurant.  The warm bread and bean and oil dip was good, but nothing to special, now I will say my goat cheese and grilled chicken pizza was delicious...cooked with a nice crispy crust, grilled chicken, bacon and spinach. I had eaten half before I realized I hadn't taken a picture...oooops!  My main entree was the Linguini con Gamberi there were 4 large shrimp and a basil pesto sauce...and it was just ok...not great...not horrible just average, which was a huge disappointment...   Dessert was cheesecake...typical nothing special...  Needless to say it wasn't horrible food or a bad experience but it wasn't outstanding ..I really wanted to like Aria more... so I'm not sure I'll be back.",

Sonoma/Aria were overwhelmed, underprepared and understaffed to handle the most basic of tasks.   The one shining star of the whole evening was the bar service.  Bartenders were on point and had good pours.  Thank goodness for that!",

    "text": "First of all, it was Valentines Day and they had a fixed menu. That rarely excites wherever you are. But we'd never been and wanted a nice evening out. This place is NOT on Tryon. It was on East Trade.  Apparently they know this, have received complaints about this, but have done nothing about correcting the address.  We went early and it good thing we did as it was not very noisy while we dined, but downright loud when we left. The service was good- very attentive, maybe even it bit too much as at one point I felt rushed.  We had mussels and caprese for our appetizers. Tasty enough, but the mussels were big, a few didn't open and the wine sauce was cool.  The caprese was disappointing with no fresh tomato, only a dollop of burratta, too much pesto and a couple slivers of sun dried tomatoes.  The bread was awesome with the garlic infused olive oil and white beans.  We split the fettuccini carbonara.  It was served with a soft boiled egg on top, the ham tasted like Smithfield and the cream sauce was just ok.  We prepare carbonara at home, and frankly, for us, it far exceeds Aria's rendition.  The chicken Parmesan was ok - we skipped the pasta and substituted it with braised kale. I'm sorry, I still expected some marinara type sauce on my chicken and while my husband gobbled up the kale, i disliked it. The crispy chicken parm was achieved by using essentially tasteless panko bread crumbs.  While overall it was an ok evening, I am still looking for a fabulous Italian restaurant in Charlotte.",

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner, and I really wish we had gone somewhere else.   First, the service was extremely slow. When we ordered our salads, we also ordered our entrees. Once our salads arrived, it had been 40 minutes before the waitress came back to the table, and another 15 minutes before our entrees came. We watched two tables be served and leave before we had even gotten our own food.   The waitress was okay, but was not attentive. I ordered the Aria Caesar Salad (Was good. Maybe not worth $8, but it was good. The menu says it has Parmigiano Crisps White Anchovies, but there was only 1 ancovie on my plate. Luckily, I don't like anchovies, but I would be disappointed if that was an element of the dish I wanted)   I ordered the Pappardelle, and it was not good at all. It was flavorless, and actually seemed like it had been microwaved. The temperatures were very uneven.  My boyfriend ordered the Grandma B's Lasagna. He was not a fan of it all.   A long time passed before the waitress came back to ask if we needed anything. At that point, all we wanted was the check.   I would not go to Aria again. I don't regret it too much because it wasn't that expensive, and at least know I know, but I've had been food at chain restaurants.   The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the restaurant is VERY pretty. Very nice lightening and decor.",

This resulted in us wasting half of it because we had to leave for the show.   I ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli and it was delicious!!  Very small portion so maybe you'll want to order an app (we always order an app with dinner but because it took our server so long..we knew we didn't have time) if you plan to eat that as a meal.  My date had the Chicken Cacciatore and he said it was good but has had better. Our dining experience was good but not enough to want to go back.  I think for a happy hour and an app would be great, for dinner..not so much.  They're is so many other wonderful places in CLT to check out! I understand and agree with their average Yelp rating.  Lastly, their health score is a 95. For as nice as this place promotes themselves and for their average ticket price, I think their score should be higher.",

The second time however, my server seemed to be extremely disrespectful. I am younger which is normally how I am treated when I go out to eat, but it's never been this bad for me before. As soon as we had been seated, our server came over to us and immediately asked us if we were ready to order our food. She didn't properly greet us at all which really threw me off and made me feel as if I was being rushed. After getting our food (which was great), she checked in on us once about 2 minutes into eating and spent the rest of her time checking in on the other tables she had in which she had a much more pleasant tone. She finally noticed we were done eating and began pre-bussing our table and noticed my boyfriends' credit card in front of him on the table. After she picked up our plates she SNATCHED his card off the table and said \"I'll take this\" and ran off before we had the chance to say anything. In all honestly, the only reason I tipped her was because I've been working in the restaurant industry for a few years and know how it is. 2 stars because the food was good.

Now, I had never been to this restaurant prior to this visit and didn't know what to expect. The one thing I noticed about this place is that no one is in a hurry. After waiting a while we met our waiter and ordered drinks. I didn't feel like alcohol so I ordered a Diet Coke. When the waiter returned, I was handled a very small bottle of soda. Why!? If you have read any of my previous reviews, one of my biggest pet peeves is not free refills and serving these tiny little bottles is their way to not give free refills. This place had already lost a star in my rating system.   After looking over the menu I went with the cheapest meal, the spaghetti and meatballs. At 14 bucks this better be some spectacular spaghetti and meatballs. When they brought it out the first thing I noticed was the small portion. Not much pasta and very small meatballs, not what I pictured from an Italian restaurant.   I'm not sure how they prepare the meatballs but it seemed to me as if they are precooked and then thrown onto a grill to reheat.  A couple were left on one side a little too long and the taste of char overwhelmed the other flavors.  While just eating the pasta the sauce actually had very good flavors and I felt the pasta was cooked perfectly.   Overall an ok place. Maybe with smaller parties they are faster with drinks and the food. But please get a soda fountain, I promise it will lower your costs and mine.",

    "text": "I've always passed by Aria but today I decided to stop in to see how the food was. I opted for the Express lunch and got the caesar salad, fettuccine carbonara and cheesecake. First we got bread and beans with olive oil. This was a great started before our meal came. The caesar salad was good and crisp. The fettuccine was delicious but for me personally I love cheese so I would have loved some additional shaved cheese. The cheesecake was nice and delicious way to end the meal. The Express meal is not for someone who is extremely hungry -FYI. We went for lunch and as expected they were busy so service was a little long or longer than expected.",

Decent chewy crust and good amount of toppings/sauce.  The server was friendly--kept butting into our conversation which seems like an odd thing to do at a location like this where people are clearly having business lunches (and this was was actually reserved as a birthday celebration)--but one of the fellas encouraged it so I can't fully blame the server.  The pacing was decent--definitely not the best as we kept having to ask for things (bread, drinks) and remind the server about things (condiments, napkins)--as we were paid and out in time to get to known meetings.  Not bad since some ordered a la carte salad + entree while others ordered the set menu which comes out all at once.  I'd go again for a business lunch but I really have no interest in doing this for dinner or at any other time.  The food just wasn't good enough to warrant it.",

The food is always great and the service is very jovial and friendly.   I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu; if it sounds good chances are it will be good. The cocktails are usually good; any 'off' drinks were more so because I just didn't enjoy the flavors as much as I thought I would (sometimes I try to be adventurous and it backfires).   If you can, try ordering a few dishes for the table to share. If you are anything like me you'll have a hard time deciding what you want and this is a good way to try it ALLLLLL.   Oh and let's not forget their lunch special where you can get 3 courses for $8.99. Sure it's a limited selection but for a quick, satisfying lunch uptown it is hard to beat.",

    "text": "Atmosphere: 5 Stars Staff and Service: 4 Star Reservations: 3 Stars Food: 3 Stars  It is really complicated review for myself. I have been a regular to Aria for almost 6 years now. What has been consistent about the place during those 6 year is simply how inconsistent the food is. Sometimes is great, sometimes is okay at best. Aria is not by any mean the best italian spot in Charlotte, but it is definitely one of the best despite their cons.   First, the decor is really great and cozy. The acoustic shows by local artists over the weekends totally makes a good atmosphere.   Second, since renovation, the place started to be overcrowded sometimes, which slow down the service, and definitely reduced the quality.  Third, the menu is well made. It is classic italian menu, with an interesting spin on some dishes. I am not going to review the food since it is very subjective to personal taste especially when it comes to italian cuisine, but for what it worth, overall the food is good, and you can clearly taste the quality of their ingredients. Any Wow factor? No really, but It is good enough after all.   You should try Aria at least once. If not for the food, just go for their bar menu/small plates as they will not disappointment you. As many have mentioned, service could be slow over the weekend, so I'd recommend visiting mid week, or during lunch hour.  Last thing, I truly love Aria, and I hope the owner/chef would take the reviews here seriously. The are many downsides that could be fixed if the ownership paid attention.",

A bruschetta appetizer was served as one massive piece of bread, as opposed to smaller, more \"shareable\" servings.    The caprese salad is served \"deconstructed\", and the heirloom tomato, which should be the star of the plate, was diced up like pico de gallo.  Flavors were there, but it's just so disappointing to see a classic like caprese subjected to interpretation.  The gnocchi was just ok - too much pepper in the sauce.  My friends penne was underdone.  It's sad.  This used to be a standby for us; always dependable.  I think it's time to find a better place for Italian uptown.  Oh, and why did the do away with proper wine glasses?  Who wants to drink a nice glass of wine in a tumbler???",

I've never witnessed my husband rave over the mussel broth before, and I know had we been alone, he would have picked up that bowl and drank it.    For our main course I had the slate grilled new York strip and the hubs had the braised leg of lamb.  I don't really know exactly how much my husband enjoyed his meal... I know he ate every bite and seemed to enjoy it... But I was so focused on how freaking good my meal was, that I wasn't paying him or his plate much attention.  My mouth waters still thinking about this meal.  Do yourself a favor and order the steak!   The only negative I had was the waiter was not as attentive as I'd like.  He was forgetful and lacked knowledge about what was actually in the plate.  But other than that, we will definitely be back to Aria!",

Grilled artichoke was nicely flavored. Gnocchi was bomb, super soft with a lot of flavor. Swordfish was overcooked, but the flavoring was nice over a bed of arugula. Had hazelnut gelato (nom), pistacho gelato (nom), and cabernet sorbetto (different, kind of grows on you after a while) for dessert. And I tried the hazelnut cake thing, delicious.

Didn't knock anything outta the park but no complaints.  Ended the meal with a slice of cheesecake which was awesome. However, it is not as good as the Palm's. Not as sugary, not as big, not half as good!  Washed everything down with a red wine that was on a pretty good deal. Came here last year for restaurant week as well and I must say neither time have I been disappointed.",

    "text": "Dinner here was ok, just ok. The decor is nice, I'm not a fan of places that have excessively dim lighting and then give you a menu in a font/color combo that is almost impossible to read because of the lighting. Our waitress was nice, but kind of forgetful and just tried to push all the expensive entrees and specials on us. They had a rack of lamb special, which my wife tried and was a little disappointed at the size of the lamb chops. For $30 you'd expect 4 maybe medium sized pieces, this rack was a little too on the small side. I had the lamb tenderloin which was nice, but I was disappointed because our waitress didn't mention that it was basically the same gnocchi garnish as I had eaten for my appetizer. If I had known that I'd probably have tried something else. She also didn't seem to have much knowledge of their alcohol selections, making recommendations of certain whiskeys or bourbons when on their menu they were more options than what she said the bar had? All in all, I just got a weird vibe from this place. We were in on a Thursday night, it was pretty empty and just quiet, a manager was basically standing at the entrance area facing the dining areas with his hands behind his back just staring around almost like a bouncer at a club. Maybe we came on an off night? The chefs seem to know what they are doing at least, food was cooked to the right temps, seasoning was on point, so I'd probably come back on a busier night and see how things go.",

Service was quick and competent, although they never took a drink order so we all ended up drinking water. I'm sure if someone was really jonesing for a soda or tea they would have made it obvious, but instead we all just enjoyed the water and the frequent refills.  My steak salad was phenomenal. The steak was served over arugula with fresh mozzarella and a balsamic vinaigrette with some roasted peppers. It was fantastic and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  Everyone else really enjoyed their dishes too, from chicken parmesan to risotto. The first comments from the group as we started to eat were that the food was so much better than you usually get at lunch.  I'm sure Aria has its ups and downs, but we clearly hit it at an \"up\" time. I will bring other people back for lunch again.",

Our server, Dennis, was excellent. He was very attentive and courteous. It didn't feel like we were sitting at the bar at all. He even noticed when one of us dropped a utensil and came right over to check up on us. The food came out at a decent amount of time and was very good too. We hope to visit Aria again soon.",

I was so pleased to see that they took our group and seated us at a special table, the Chef's table.  To top if off the menu was fully open for Queen's Feast.  Most places do a shortened menu but not Aria.  I had the daily special which the name escapes me but it was very similar to a pork osso bucco dish atop pasta.  It was delicious!  The teramisu (sp) was incredible as a dessert as well.  The service was also very good and the food came out incredibly fast actually.   I would have liked it to have come to the table a bit more throttled but they were also slammed and probably trying to turn tables as quickly as possible.",

Even the wine, which is served in \"old fashioned\" / \"whiskey\" glasses (which is silly for a place with these prices), tasted funny like they still had chlorine in them from the dishwasher.

    "text": "Since I keep passing this place on my way to lunch everyday, I figured I had to try it out sooner or later. After I received two good recommendations about it, I decided it was finally time!  I went there last Friday with my co-workers and I will admit that I was pleasantly surprised. Not only was the food delicious, but the variety of items offered on the menu allows for an expansive Italian taste tour. My only reservation about Aria is in regard to the appetizers which, in my opinion are far too small to demand the price that they do. It's literally ONE crab cake for $12 and five tiny morsels of cheese also for $12. I found the caramelized gnocchi a bit \"doughy,\" but the calamari is the best I've had this side of the country.  The entrees are definitely the selling points of this restaurant. The slow cooked beef short rib was tender, pink, juicy, and fatty! Osso Bucco and Angus Rib-Eye Filet were equally note-worthy. I'd say the red meat is their forte. Moreover, the portions suddenly quadruple in size once you get to the entrees such that you may as well skip out on the apps all together. My compatriots weren't raving about their chicken or pasta dishes and I came to the conclusion that their judgments were reasonable. \"Tastes like chicken.\"  One aspect I particularly enjoyed about Aria was the attention placed on the garnishes for each dish. The tuna sashimi is served on a salt board, which flavors the meat as time passes (Don't wait too long though!). The \"italian mac/cheese underneath the rib-eye is absolutely amazing (not overly-cheesy) and the garlic swiss chard on the Osso Bucco was relished by all.   I would definitely come here again to try more things on the menu. Perhaps I would pass on the apps this time because I would trade one entree for three apps any day of the week.  Yum!  4/5",

Because my taste buds are sensitive to salt, I unfortunately didn't like my shrimp risotto entree, but it was whisked away the moment our server sensed a frown and replaced with a dish that was perfect. My partner's pork and mashed potatoes was outstanding and flawlessly cooked.  The restaurant featured live music, which was pitch perfect and broadcasted at an appropriate volume that was enjoyable and didn't kill conversation. The interior is casually chic, a place where jeans and a blazer are as at home as a nice dress and heels. Based on how expertly trained our server clearly was, it seemed like a really well run restaurant.  We loved it!",

I tried a bite of the caramelized gnocchi as well as the orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe and they were also very good. The desert was the best I've had in a while. I had the lemon semifreddo with blackberries, it was fantastic.   The service was fairly good. It definitely got better as the night went on. At first, it really seemed like we had thrown our waiter off somehow, as if we snuck up on him. By the end of the meal he was cracking jokes and had redeemed himself.    Aria is a very pretty restaurant. It's slightly below street level, with a warm inviting glow off the white leather covering all the chairs and benches. There is a large window looking into the kitchen, which gave us something to look at while savoring our food.   I'm told Aria is pricey as Charlotte restaurants go, but I thought the prices mirrored the quality and size of the dishes perfectly.  Maybe more expensive than other restaurants in the area, but worth every penny.",

The bar was big enough for plenty of people to gather around, and there was a lot of other seating to accommodate plenty of butts in seats -- good for a busy Friday night.   Unfortunately, the drinks weren't great, and the bartenders were less than attentive. I was disappointed at how long it took to order our first round, which because of the delay (and the weird drink flavors some of us experienced), ended up being our ONLY round of drinks.

    "text": "My company hosted their annual holiday party here recently, and I was quite impressed with Aria's staff for a job well done. The food was on point, especially the steak with horseradish sauce. Even though the meal was catered for a group over 140 people, it certainly didn't taste that way. We were told by management prior to our attendance that service might be slow since our group was a bit larger than anticipated, but I didn't get that sense at all. Bar service was very efficient, and empty cups and dirty plates were swept away by waitstaff as if by ninjas.  There was tasteful live music at our venue. The space is a bit tight in some spots, but it made for a much more intimate atmosphere. Also, Aria offered us complementary valet parking, which was great as there was a football game in town that night.  I'm not sure about the price figure on our party, but I think it was worth however much was spent. We all had a great time.  I need to come back for dinner sometime.",

The location is good if you have plans in Uptown and want to grab a drink or the $5 bar food after 5pm before going out or to a show, but I don't recommend this place if you are a foodie. I had the arugula walnut salad and the crispy chicken parmigiana. Both dishes lacked flavor.   Service was good though. Our server was very sweet and accommodating.",

The kitchen is open concept,  so you are able to see the chefs as they cook,  which is pretty cool.   The service was great,  we were attended to every minute it seemed. Three different people periodically came to check in. It was nice,  but not really that necessary.  Our waiter was very pleasant and made sure we had everything we needed at all times.  If he refilled our water any quicker,  he would have had to literally stand by our table the whole time.    The prices for lunch are incredibly reasonable and so are the options. The food was not bad.  I had the Penne ala Vodka. It was well made,  but I personally would have liked it salted/seasoned a little more. That being said I did eat all of it and I enjoyed it.   Overall,  good experience and would definitely comeback.",

They start you off with bread and beans. Weird right? You eat them separately but there is EVOO on the table. The beans are white and full of flavor. It is very different from the usual. I had the carbonara no bacon and it was AMAZING. It was enough sauce and plenty of flavor. I added chicken which was grilled and the perfect size. They serve Aqua Panna water. My boyfriend had the penne al a vodka. He said it was perfect. The interior is elegant. They have a wall full of wine with a rolling ladder. I will be back!!!",

The atmosphere was modern and upscale, but they didn't mind me and my buddy grabbing a table im our workout clothes, after a bike ride through the city. We were seated immediately after walking in around 10:30pm on a Friday night. The server greeted us shortly after we were seated, and was both friendly and attentive throughout our experience. For dinner I ordered the Sicillian chicken Cacciatore ($19), which is the chef's special a cording to the menu. No disrespect to the chef, but the dish wasn't so special. The dish definitely could have used some more flavor, because no one likes bland chicken. My friend ordered the Crispy chicken parmigiana ($16), which I wish I ordered myself, because the dish definitely had more taste all over. Over all, the customer service experience was great, but I found myself wishing my dish was as good.",

The chef's table overlooks the kitchen and is in a little separate room away from the rest of the restaurant.   Everyone at the table ordered the express lunch - which is a great deal and idea! upon sitting and taking our lunch orders, we were presented with bread and a bean dip. The dip lacked salt, but was otherwise tasty.   The express menu is $9.99. Salad, pasta, and cheesecake dessert. Most of the pasta dishes come with meatballs r sausage, but you can switch this out for chicken at no additional charge.  I was pleasantly surprised how good this place was for lunch. Skip the dessert... not worth the calories. Wish they would offer a different dessert.   The size of the meal is perfect for lunch, i left feeling satisfied.

I had made reservations and despite being 5 minutes late they were very accommodating to us. Granted it was a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy, but I still appreciate how polite they were.  The ambience was very nice; good for a date night. Definitely a bit more of a formal affair if you go for dinner.  Our waitress, Robin, was the star of the show. She was very patient with us, answered all of our questions thoroughly, and was just very understanding and enthusiastic in general.  The food was good. For the price I think it should have been a bit better, but there was nothing I didn't enjoy. We got bruschetta and a salad - the bruschetta was good; definitely could have gone without the salad as it was pretty underwhelming.  My date got the pork chop which was pretty good (flavorful,  moist, the whole shabang). Portion was what I would expect from an upscale restaurant so that doesn't really bother me. I got the orechiette which was good, but not unbelievable by any means.   All in all, I'd say it was it was a good experience for the nature of the dinner. Not sure that we would come back just because the food was good at best, but would go back for a company meal or something.",

It might've been squid ink that colored the pasta as it was dark in color. The sauce was chunky tomato based and had a spicy kick to it.  Flavor was good, and I would pick it again.

We had reservations for an early dinner around 5 pm, hardly anyone there and yet within the hour the restaurant was packed  The restaurant has a comfortable atmosphere and our waiter was friendly and attentive and answered our questions we had about the menu.  He poured water in tall glasses for us, readily took any other beverage orders. Interesting  to note that the individual glasses of Chianti  came in 1/2 filled short beverage tumblers and not typical  red wine glasses . Bread came to the table, was very delicious along with a tall bottle of Evoo plus some  small dishes of a tasty white bean condiment.  The menu features a variety of appetizers, several salads, a tomato basil soup, variety of pizzas, pasta dishes, other entrees to include chicken, lamb, beef and fish and seafood.. Desserts such as mascarpone cheese cake, cannoli  and tiramisu were on the menu  Prices moderate, portions adequate, food came out  hot, plated nicely, and most was tasty and delicious.   We all enjoyed our food. My dinner was  good but not exceptional in my opinion .Some of my dining mates also felt the same way about their dinners too.   One dining mate enjoyed her Caesar salad, plenty of dressing on it. I had the heirloom tomato caprese appetizer.  Plated, a wedge of soft delicious mozzarella surrounded by a  thin smear of basil pesto , (wished more of that) , along with small cubes of red tomatoes.  My dining mate had  one  of the appetizer specials of the night,  sliced duck breast  over focaccia with peaches and a savory sauce. . He said it was  very tasty.  3 of of us ordered the chefs version of chicken cacciatore, a very popular menu item.. We were able to substitute for the polenta it was normally  served over.  One substituted with pasta, mine with extra veges instead of the mascarpone polenta which the 3rd diner had.  Plated were 2 pieces of chicken nicely positioned on the plate. It was nice to see a piece of chicken with a bone instead of boneless chicken breast.  The chicken was tasty and nicely seasoned. My extra veges were mostly soupy stewed tomatoes . My dining mate said polenta was ok. The sauce was described with olives, capers and cremini mushrooms. The big green olives with pits were there, one or two  mushrooms in each order on our plates;  so for mushroom lovers a disappointment.  Other entrees our dining mates ordered were Grandma's lasagna, very much enjoyed, sliced lamb with gnocchi- tender lamb but heavy gnocchi however lamb enjoyed,  Pappardelle Rosso pasta which was noted as excellent, 2 orders of chicken parmesan also very much enjoyed.   One dining mate asked for his sauce on the side, so changes or substitutes readily done to please the diner.  For dessert, the canolli  was not enjoyed, the shell so tough it could not be cut with a fork, the filling very good. The waiter was notified and mentioned others  had the same complaint. The mascarpone cheesecake was very delicious. The coffee was also very good.  All in all it was a very enjoyable dining experience for us all.   We would probably return  and try ordering different dinners next time.",

He even brought the checks for everyone and asked if anyone wanted dessert- that was a little rude as he didn't wait my husband to finish the food and we felt rushed. The ambience is good and they had live music as well.",

They also have a great $5 bar bites menu, if you want to come by after work for an appetizer. Great list, including beef sliders and pizza.. Totally a winner.  They have a spring sweet pea ravioli on the menu that is out of this world! It's made with mint, lemon, peas, and topped with prosciutto, swiss chard and a butter sauce. It is perfectly refreshing and very tasty. The pasta al nero is a great mix with lumb crab, mussels, shrimp and linguine. It's a great way to try a little bit of everything, with a hint of spice. Super delicious and worth getting to share.Service is very good, and I love the intimate setting. They even have a private table in the back. Can't wait to come back for bar bites and restaurant week.",

I didn't like the wine list design, although they have some great picks.  Waitstaff was friendly even though you could tell they were frazzled by my large party as well as 3 other large tables nearby. The manager had a bit of a snobby attitude, but he thought he was helpful. Bathrooms were clean and there's a coat rack in the back hallway.  Overall, it was good. I'd go back",

Specialty drinks are very good, they have a wonderful selection of top shelf alcohol. I had a an Italian martini and my hubs had green house tonic.  They start with a cold whole canalini bean dip to put on a warm white bread, just ok.  To start we ordered the caramelized  gnocchi delish! And the Maine mussels in white garlic sauce also fantastic!! Entrees we had pasta el Nero and fettuccine carbonara both full of flavor, perfect amount of food and served hot. We had specialty coffees to end! A bit pricey but I felt worth it for the quality of food, atmosphere and service. Also have complimentary parking!",

We had made reservations beforehand and when we walked in, they had our table ready, which was great.  The location is great and it's so close to everything else in Downtown Charlotte. The interior is very modern, simple, and clean. They have a way of making their place look spacious, even if it's a packed house. They can accommodate parties of more than 15 people. They also have bar seating as well.   We went and were seated right away with the menus. The waitress made a great wine recommendation. However, it took almost 30 minutes for everyone to get their drinks -- not to mention that bread wasn't served until about 10-15 minutes after our drinks were served. We were all starving by then and chowed down the bread. We ordered our food after we got all our drinks and then it was another really long wait to get our food (about 20-30 minutes). By this time, the restaurant was emptying out and it wasn't as busy so I don't know what took so long.  The food was good and everyone was happy with their choices. However, because of the long wait for our food, we were super hungry and we ate our food super fast. Then it took about another 20-30 minutes for us to get our checks and then another 15 minutes for us to get our cards back.  Great location, good food, slow slow slow service.",

    "text": "I loved everything about Aria. The food was excellent, my server (Richard) was wonderful and the decor was beautiful. I stopped by on a Thursday evening after work to grab some dinner. The bar was getting pretty packed with men and women in suits and ties.  The menu looked good but the bar bites menu looked even better. Each plate was $5 and that was what sold me. I am always one who wants to try everything on the menu but my eyes are bigger than my stomach so I stuck to just three of the items. I ordered the caramelized gnocchi, beef short ribs and the bone marrow.   Before my orders were brought out I was presented with a small bowl of tuscan beans and a nice loaf of bread. It was crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. The beans were drizzled with olive oil and had a hint of lemon juice, salt, parsley, black pepper and salt. You eat the beans with the bread. I've never had this before and it was really good.  When my entrees came out they were beautifully plated and they tasted as good as they looked. My top favorite is the bone marrow. In close second was the beef short ribs and then the gnocchi. You scoop out the bone marrow, spread it on your buttered toast and top it off wit the veggies (parsley, red onions, capers). The beef short ribs were sitting on top of polenta and was topped with some greens (don't know what type) and what looked like cubes of beets. It was drizzled with a fruity, acidic sauce. The dish was pulled together nicely. The gnocchi was also beautifully plated but I got this only because it was a dish I have never had before. It looked like little balls of dough but did not taste doughy at all. It was soft and chewy but did not have much flavor. If it wasn't for the toppings (Prosciutto di Parma, Pear, Gorgonzola, Truffle Oil) I wouldn't have liked it.   I was pretty full at the end of my meal and didn't finish everything but wanted to get dessert to go. I opted for the chocolate Hazelnut Cake with Hazelnut Gelato & Vanilla Cream. Since I did not have a freezer in my hotel room for the gelato and ice cream, I had to get a substitute of berries. The slice of cake was pretty big and I could not finish it. The cake itself was a little dry but if you take in the hazelnut and the cake along with the chocolate together it is absolutely decadent. I would have been sinful if I had the ice cream and gelato too because I was told that it compliments the cake beautifully and brings out even more flavors. Ugh, I wish I had saved room to eat it the way it was supposed to be eaten. Oh well.",

    "text": "Aria is typically not the type of establishment I would frequent. It seems like the type of place that people who think they are sophisticated go to feel like they are sophisticated. As I'm fond of saying when I see tables VIP reserved at the booty clubs here in Charlotte, \"This is not New York City.\"  Despite the Gattaca style ambiance that this troglodyte normally doesn't associate with Italian joints, the food was awesome. It does happen every so often that my ingrained, arbitrary, judgmental prejudices are incorrect.  This was a restaurant week visit and Aria gets automatic kudos for offering practically the full menu instead of paring the choices down to three or four almost popular options.  I did play it traditional with my meal, sticking to classic staples. The fried calamari was fresh, light and crispy, not greasy or oily at all, with plenty of tentacles, which are the best part. For my main entree, I had the linguine and clams like some kind of mafioso. Fresh clams in the shell and plenty of them served on a bed of al dente linguine and understated white wine clam sauce. The portion size thankfully is not overwhelming nor skimpy. All finished off with an amazing cheesecake, perhaps one of the best deserts I've ever had and I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake. Aria could be worth an end of the evening stop simply for desert. And I really don't believe in desert; it takes up too much stomach space that I need for meal gorging.  This three course dinner was not heavy at all like a lot of Italian food, sitting in your gut some sort of fart bomb ready to go off.  I did not get a drink, but the table next me ordered some refreshing looking cocktails. I'm comfortable enough with myself to drink pink. The wine selection is extensive. It's supposed to be, it's an Italian restaurant.  If I had a special lady, I'd take her here. Yeah, it's that nice.",

    "text": "Went to Aria on Nov 8 for a girls night out. The location which is in the heart of downtown Charlotte and very convenient if you are going out on the town after dinner. The interior is chic and modern and had a very nice vibe when you entered the restaurant. We were seated right away upon arrival in a quite corner of the room with a view of the kitchen. We ordered several cocktails (can't remember the names right now...go figure) but they all were delicious. For apps we had the fritto misto and beef carpaccio. Both dishes were amazing, but I am still dreaming about the beef carpaccio to this day, it was that amazing.  For entrees I had the lamb shank, which was so tender and simply perfection. My other two friends had the salmon and chicken. Both of those were pretty excellent as well. Overall we had an amazing time and I cannot wait to make it back to Aria.",

We were seated and our server Julio came to fill our water glasses and soon brought bread and their bean spread. The bread was warm and delicious.   We shared the charcuterie board for two with a selection of meats and cheeses, warm pita bread, olives, fruit jam and sun dried tomatoes.   My co-worker ordered a glass of Rose and said it was wonderful, not too sweet. I had a glass of Pinot grigio and it was crisp.   She ordered the scallops which were wonderful, but the portion of 3 was small. I had the trout and it was very a large portion. I wish there was a bit more of the sweet potato, overall the dish was great.   Finished the meal with the classic tiramisu, served in a jar. It was incredible.   Our server was very attentive, checked on how we liked everything and he was very patient with the table next to us too when they asked several questions about the menu.   I loved the picture window into the kitchen and the overall feel of the restaurant too. Definitely will have to come back for their $5 bar bites!",

We sat down at 8:30 which was our reservation time, however did not even get our food order taken until 9:30. Luckily we had enough conversation and some drinks to pass the time however I do find that unsettling. The wine I had was delicious. It was Remo Farina Ripasso. I had the gnocchi which was a little bland I was disappointed with that. The seating upstairs is extremely tight and I got bumped a few times by the servers having to get through to the other tables. The ambiance was nice but if I had to celebrate anything I wouldn't go back there. They do have complimentary valet which is a plus.",

It also came with seasoned cannelloni beans and I noticed the server putting olive oil in it for a table nearby but not ours. I ordered the mussels, short rib and chocolate cake. The mussels were in a sauce that was very rich and tasted like only heavy cream and garlic. I still enjoyed them. The short rib was great. The chocolate cake shouldn't be advertised as a cake at all and was rather a mousse but it was really good.",

This is a restaurant in uptown, those two conditions are somewhat expected.  With that said, a group of my friends and I went to Aria on a Thursday night and had very good service and a decently priced meal. I currently live in New York so the price seemed more than fair to me for an Uptown location ($14 for chicken parm). They did charge for seltzer water which caught me off guard but one bottle is about $6, so $2 if you split it with 2 friends.  Although part of my party wasn't there, we were immediately offered to be seated and once everyone got there, they sat us. The service was good and our waitress was friendly. The ambience was nice and could be great for either a romantic meal or a corporate meal with clients.   Everything was very good and we enjoyed dining here. If you are in the area, this is a good spot to check out but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here either.",

I enjoy their pizza, meatballs, caprese salad with peach, limoncello dessert cocktails, gnocchi and squid ink pasta with crab. The wine selections are amazing, especially the Tuscan Rosso varieties, the team will be able to help you pair wines to compliment your meal, the Italian way! A couple cool things about Aria include a fantastic sunken bar to enjoy happy hour....The glass wall in dining room allows you to see the kitchen at work AND you call also reserve a chefs table for a special dinner with family/friends!!!  The service is fantastic, as for location in Uptown it's perfect for concerts and shows.  Often you can find street parking a couple blocks away which lets you feel better about indulging a bit; however, they do validate parking at the garage across from them closest to Ritz.",

The beans that they bring you to put on your bread are unique and delicious. Our favorite dish was the carmelized gnocchi appetizer - it was very flavorful and the pears add a nice crunch!   As someone who has waited tables in the past, I appreciated Lucky taking time to make our experience enjoyable and personal. He was a very attentive server.

Yes, I know there was an event there; however, it was not \"closed off\" to the public & they had menus all over the place, which is an invitation to order.  The appetizers the waiters did bring around were tasty. I had a fried coconut shrimp & a pastry wrapped asparagus.   This place has potential, but it's clear they need to work out the kinks of having an event and continuing to service the public.",

Plus, they don't use fresh pasta! $15.  Osso Bucco: Tender pork roast with NO flavor at all. $25.  Veal Scallopini: Aria's specialty. Tastes like it's from Olive Garden.  Tiramisu: Decent and decently priced at $6.  Overall, the highlights were the bread and tiramisu, but they weren't life changing. For the price you pay and the terribly slow and unfriendly service, it's not worth it.",

Very knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to choosing the right foods for your current mood. As much as our server tried to get a couple of us to go with the white sauce Maine Mussels for apps, we went with the red and haven't regretted it since. Their menu has a lot of options for picky eaters. I went with the NC Trout for my main course. Trout was perfectly portioned with the right flavors and textures to combine.

We were greeted with a not so welcoming tone, where we almost felt like a burden for entering the restaurant by the host. We were seated in the up stairs dining area, with a view of an indoor mall. Our waiter luckily was much more welcoming than our host, his service was excellent, checked up on us and provided us with our food promptly.   As for our meal, we ordered a margerhita pizza as an appetizer which was perfect, and had a light tomato sauce. We then ordered the slate grilled ny strip which was  delicious, and also ordered the pan roasted nantucket scallops which i found tender but a bit overly seasoned. Out of those 2 dishes i would prefer the ny strip. We also ordered the expresso cheesecake which had a perfect consistency.  Servings are a decent size compared for these 2 dishes but is pricey. 4 stars because i felt host and hostess could have been welcoming and who wants to feel like your not welcomed?  Should visit if you've got the cash to spend, special occasion worthy? No.",

    "text": "I really really wanted to like this place. I know many people who say it is good but honestly the only good thing about this place is the decor. It gives off a very romantic vibe however our experience was anything but. We stopped in for a post show dinner and the place was dead empty. I realize it was fairly late but they were still open and it was a Friday night. Our waiter was, well a snob. He had no time for us, got a little huffy when we didn't know what we wanted to order and I think he was perturbed that we didn't have drink orders ready. However he never once offered any suggestions to us whatsoever. So he comes over takes out his pad and stands there staring, when we asked for a little more time he huffed off and it took him forever to come back. Still never once offered any kind of help with the menu, and we couldn't even ask him. He had another table that he was way more focused on even though it was only a two person table like ours. Apparently he wasn't impressed with us. We ordered what sounded good and honestly the food was mediocre at best. I expected way more out of the food than we got. We tried the bruschetta duo which tasted okay but mostly just lacked any kind of flavor or pizzazz, I can make better! Then we got the Pork Arrosto and the gnocchi. The Pork Arrosto was pretty much all fat, maybe it was a poor order on my part, but I've had pork belly before and this was basically just the fat and It just wasn't good. The gnocchi was okay better than the pork anyways. All in all this is just not a place I would come back to. I could probably ignore the service if the food just wasn't so sub-par. I expected more from a place at that price point, in that location etc. After reading many of the other reviews it might be time for Aria to rethink their hiring practices!! I can't imagine we will come back again.",

From the time the group arrived, the manager was rude.  While waiting for the rest of the group to arrive, the manager came to our table of 20 adults and loudly asked if we were going to order or not.  Many guests had ordered adult drinks and a few had ordered dinner.  How rude and embarrassing!!  The other patrons in the restaurant overheard the comments. After requesting the waitress ask the manager to return to the table to discuss his comments, he returned.  This time he was equally as rude, unprofessional, and inappropriate. He over talked the person who was speaking on behalf of the group.   Please understand, we are all professionals and no one was inappropriate toward the staff. At that point, I refused to order!!  Our party of 20+ politely left, paying for the food and drinks we consumed. We went to another local restaurant that accommodated us and had an excellent experience!!!  I work extremely had, as we all do.  I will not patronize a restaurant that shows little respect for its customers.",

We made reservations ahead of time, enjoyed a delicious dinner, and made it to the theater in plenty of time.    We skipped the appetizers and ordered linguine with clam sauce and the wild mushroom risotto.  Both were very good, and the server was excellent.  Dessert was salted caramel gelato, and you can mix & match gelato and sorbet flavors for a variety.    Aria also offers a 10% discount when you present your BPAC theater tickets.  If you're going to theater on weekends or matinees, check times and make reservations to be sure they're open.  Overall a great choice!",

Long story short, I park a block away and ask a cop for directions.  At 635pm, I arrive at the restaurant  whose front doors are on E Trade and the valet sits on the corner of Trade and College. In a fowl mood, I was greeted by a extremely nice and witty blonde bartender who calmed me down as she brought me my favorite OMB Copper, that I was happy they served and supported. Not knowing it was restaurant week, our business party of 6 were seated promptly at the Chef's table in the kitchen.  We all ordered off the regular menu which was  slightly extended than the RW offering but not by much. Our server was friendly but this table is very hard to serve.  It also is louder since you hear the restaurant noise as well as the chef orchestrating service. I don't think I would ever want to sit in a kitchen again. All of our portions were a good size a fare price.  My veal though was tough but had great flavor. Everyone said they enjoyed their food but it was not anything special. There is a good selection of wines  but our server was not very familiar with many. I would go back, now that I know how to get there, and give them another try.  Maybe they had the RW first night glitters.",

We had reservations, which I would recommend. We didn't get sat exactly on time, but we loved sitting at the bar drinking wine and ordering their small appetizer bites. Definitely recommend the reduced price bar apps if you have to wait.   We ordered the gnocchi, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parmigiana, and chicken carbonara. No one complained that the food was heavy or undercooked, everything was just right.   The service could have been slightly more attentive, but nothing that detracted from the overall great meal we all experienced.",

We sat at the bar (although the best tables are in front on the kitchen) to try the best they had to offer. I am fairly confident that everything we didn't try would be excellent too! We sampled the Arugula Salad, Gnocchi - very very good, Spaghetti and Meatballs (I can't remember the last time I was convinced to order spaghetti and meatballs) , and polenta with roasted mushrooms. We wrapped up with the Lemon Semifreddo.  Everything we had was excellent. The chefs at Aria know exactly how to prepare each dish with perfection. The ingredients are clean and simple...very Italian in their approach. It's never about how much you can put into a dish, but rather the a few high-quality components ...  Enjoy. I know I will the next time.",

The server was pretty knowledgeable about the food and made good recommendations, including the gnocchi.  I'm very hard to please with gnocchi (ever since having THE BEST GNOCCHI EVER at Frasca in Boulder...but I digress).  I'm not sure why these guys put proscuitto in the gnocchi dish (kind of a wrapper) but it's hard to complain about proscuitto in just about any appetizer.  I ordered one of the nightly specials -- the suckling pig.  Honestly, it was good but could have been better.  I'm not sure how they did it but they managed to cook in dry in some parts but not in others.    I thought the wine list was reasonably priced.  I'm not sure why other reviewers complain that the selection was small.  I thought it was sufficient (I'm not a fan of the huge wine lists.)  We had a bottle of a pinot from Burgundy and it was tasty (lighter than the pinot noir I'm used to in Oregon....we finished our bottle and had a glass of a Willamette Valley p.n. that was even better.  Might have earned an additional half star except the server messed up my order and that made it take too long.  Plus, it's a bit over-priced...but ok for a special occasion or client dinner.",

    "text": "I had a pretty good experience at this place, so let's get under way with some pro's-con's.  Some of my coworkers came down from NYC, so right off the bat, it was going to be a LBD kind of night. We began craving some good food around 930, so because they were staying at the Omni, all signs pointed to Aria. This was my first time going here.  It was pretty crowded (which is weird for any place in Charlotte at that time) so we had to wait maybe 5 minutes before we got seated. I was alright with that because I already had a few Jameson's in me, so all I really cared about was staying out of the cold. The waitress was phenomenal, never letting our glasses go dry. This was really spectacular because by that point, I couldn't even tell you right from left.  We scoured the menu and I came across the love of my life. Artichokes. Yes ladies and gents, I will take a nice artichoke over ALOT of things. So that was to be my appetizer paired with my main course of Potato Gnnochis (hey, I was trying to see if I could do veggie for a week).   First off, the artichokes were sent from heaven. The leaves were sooooooo juicy and tender that you can almost eat it like a muffin. My only complaint was that they were a tad garlicky. Once I pounded that out, I got started on my gnocchi's. They were pan-seared with asparagus, onions, etc. This was soooo good that it made the NY guineas I was with blush. The food, bless it's heart, was splendid.  Now on to the ambience of the place. It's a very clean, trendy restaurant. The crowd (not sure if it was just that night) was a little strange. Let's just say, I saw a 55 year old guy with a pony-tail kiss 6 different call-girls as they came strolling in one at a time. How did I know they were call girls you ask? Well, they all had slammin bodies, but their faces look kind of busted. Plus they were wearing outfits straight out of J-Wow's closet.  Any, this place is pretty LBD. On my LBD scale, it has to be an 8 trending to a 9. If I went back, I'd probably just order the same thing because it was THAT GOOD.  Holla.",

    "text": "My husband and I were here for their \"bar bites\" (happy hour) menu before going to an exhibit at the nearby Mint Museum uptown. I think everything on the bar bites menu was $5 (food) and there were drink specials as well. In NC, sadly, we can't really enjoy happy hour (it's illegal to sell drinks at a discount for a set window within a day - you can have specials on drinks, but they must be offered all day...). Like most bar bites and happy hour menus, you have to eat in the bar to get the special. We were promptly greeted by the bartender who poured filtered water from a bottle (tap water basically) into our glasses. She was very friendly, and gave us the time we needed to look over the menu. Tip: the happy hour or bar bite menu is tucked in the back of the cocktail menu.  We ordered the calamari (small portion and average at best), the lamb sliders (you get two, they're served with delicious goat cheese, some kind of lettuce/green, and homemade thin-sliced pickles - yum), and two orders of the truffle oil gnocchi! We got two orders because my husband had tried them here before (they're offered as an appetizer for much more) and insisted we get two. Thank goodness we did - I don't think I would have shared. This was far and away the highlight of our options! Crazy-delicious. Usually, anything cooked with truffles or truffle oil is great, but the texture was almost airy-pillowy, they were perfectly cooked and seasoned and were served with some thin slices of fresh and deliciously salty prosciutto.   We will definitely come back, but we'll just jump to the gnocchi! My husband got a glass of Woodford reserve on the rocks - $14 - not cheep at all, but not an uncommon price or markup. The entrees of the nearby customers looked great too. The restaurant is big (with an upstairs area) and is nicely decorated without being stuffy. I went in wearing jeans and felt fine... I visited the ladies room, which I only note because the floor was oddly super sticky - my shoes stuck with each step.   Overall, I give it 5 stars. Great location, good service and quality food. I believe they also offer free valet, but we didn't use it because we got there before 6pm (the city of CLT doesn't let the valet companies set up before 6PM due to traffic flow). We parked in the underground deck \"the greens\" for $5.   Hope this review was useful. Enjoy - and don't forget to get the gnocchi!!!! Also see my attached pictures...",

We were totally disappointed in the food and also the service that we all received. We were never told that there were a $3 cake cutting fee for everyone that ate cake. It totaled $24!!! More than what the cake was worth. Christy (General Manager) stated that she told one of us of the cake cutting charge. We explained to her that she spoke to a 15 year old, not an adult, Christy's reply was \"She DONT look 15 to me\". Half the birthday party was 15 year olds. Christy could not tell the difference from a 15 year old with a 50 year old adult. Seemed a bit racist to us. The portion size of the food was a bit small for the cost, and one of our party members sent their food back, and didn't order anything else, due to the mediocre food and poor service. Please be advised even if you convey your request in the memo section of the reservation. It WILL NOT BE HONORED....",

My coworkers and I ventured to Aria for lunch on a Friday and got there about 15 minutes after they opened at 11:45 a.m. We walked in and waited... and waited... and waited. Although three servers were literally leaning up against the walk talking to each other, not working, we stood at the hostess stand for a good five minutes before someone finally came over and greeted us - and I use the term \"greeted\" loosely.  The woman snarkily asked if we'd been helped; we hadn't. She then said, \"Do you have a reservation? You don't.\" The restaurant was barely half full, and she was a complete jerk to us and the other hostess who eventually wandered over to the hostess stand. They acted like us not making a reservation (there were 5 of us) was just about the worst thing that could ever happen. My coworkers and I were all looking at each other like \"Is this seriously happening? Are we really being treated this rudely?\" They were.  Our food was fine - I got the grilled chicken salad - but it certainly wasn't worth the awful service we got.",

We were running late for pur reservation, and the restaurant was still able to accommodate our group.    The menu didn't have a lot of variety, but the options were so hard to choose from.  When we ordered they were nice enough to split two entrees into smaller plates so two of us could share!  The portions were huge, we should have just shared one dish.  We ordered the fetuccini and spaghetti.  They were both great and full of flavor.  However, the meatballs on the spaghetti were about quarter size.

I hesitated, given that it's clearly a lovely restaurant, but we were graciously welcomed and given the \"chef's table\" when I asked for somewhere unobtrusive where we wouldn't disturb anyone. The birthday girl is a budding chef and was thrilled to watch the kitchen at work. Our server, Justin, was gracious and kind to all of us and even put together a special dinner for the tiny guest who doesn't like Italian.   Turns out this little one inhaled every plate that came to our table. From the cannellini bean salad presented with the bread to the caprese to the risotto, each dish was delicious and our young guests declared themselves ruined for any other pizza or pasta.   We left stuffed and happy and the kids had an evening that is now a shared wonderful experience. We will absolutely be back!",

    "text": "Like several places in Uptown, the address listed is sure to confuse because you really cant get to the restaurant by 100 N. Tryon. Better to call ahead and get the low down on the Best way to get in. We got rerouted walking through the building several times and it was a little annoying.  The place was packed as most of the diners seemed to be going to the show at the Blumenthal (as we were). This would be a challenge I am sure as everyone arrives at similar times, but everyone wants to go at nearly exactly the same time. However, that must be a regular challenge for the restaurant so I certain they train their folks on the most efficient way to manage that. Which brings me to my point. Training.  Our server was very nice, but I think there is a little more work that can be done to develop your servers to represent the brand. We asked for a wine recommendation and she said she didn't know anything about wine. Hm. Missed opportunity to create some interest to turn a glass of wine into a bottle or stimulate some conversation in that direction. She said she would ask the bar person to pick something out. In a few minutes a man came and dropped of a glass of wine with no comment. My friend did not know what kind of wine it was and no one checked back to ask if it was okay until the meal was over. The food was...okay. We got the octopus appetizer special. It look more like calamari with the little tentacles etc. I am accustomed to getting a thicker piece of tentacle that you can slice. It was hard to get a real sense of the taste just chewing a tangle of legs. One friend got the pasta with sausage. I got the gnocchi with short rib ragu. The gnocchi was actually very good. Light and airy, it did not feel as heavy as I was a little concerned it may be. The short rib ragu however was extremely salty. My mouth still felt the saltiness an hour later as I was sitting in the theater wishing I had a 2 liter bottle of water. Another friend had the butternut squash ravioli though and it was Best of Show. Absolutely delicious with a brown butter sage treatment. If our other meals were that good, I could almost forgive that it took so long to get a second drink at our table. From the time we wanted one, we tried to get someone's attention for several minutes, then from the time we asked for it, we were finished eating by the time they came. Service just wasnt all that great here tonight. For restaurants that are conveniently located for the theater, I would probably come again as Aria was still so much better than some others close by.",

There is an entrance to the restaurant from the commons area of the Bank of America Corporate Center building in which Aria is located. The restaurant either cannot or won't close off this entrance during business hours. Thus - we had a constant annoying stream of people coming and going to the restaurant during our presentations - some of them talking loudly as they came up the stairs to exit the restaurant.  Secondly, the upstairs room IS NOT isolated from the rest of the restaurant - the stairway and some open space allow a lot of noise to filter upstairs. The second presenter had to move away from the podium right up to the group so that he could be heard (microphone was not working).  I'm not going to ding Aria about the meeting space issues as I had no hand in booking the space. Had I made the arrangements for the space and then had this happen, I would have dinged them a couple extra stars.",

There was this one time that service wasn't good. In fact, it was bad. No eye contact, and nothing after a compliment. But all other times have been great so I'm willing to bet that it was just that one person.   Now, in case you haven't noticed, I love their Spaghetti & Meatballs. It's fantastic. The sauce is what I remember from childhood, the pasta is just right, but the meatballs definitely steal the show. They are the best in town. I'm saying it and you can trust me on this.",

I ordered the tuna and it was worth the $5, nothing more. I ordered the \"Tomato Braised 24 Hour Pork Shank\".  There is no way the pork shank was braised for 24 hours.  If it were, the meat would have been tender..falling off the bone which it was not.  The tomato sauce had zero flavor.  All in all, the meal sucked and it was served lukewarm.  The bar service was ok at best. I will now return to eating at the Capital Grill which never disappoints although a bit pricey",

    "text": "The food was good, not spectacular, but again...good. I had the: - calamari which could have used more seasoning, salt...flavor - lamb pappardelle which was good, but also needed something to bring out the flavor - la scalla limoncello cocktail which was really good  I had just come from the spa and was dressed casually (jeans, sweater, boots). I was concerned I might be a bit under-dressed, but turned out I was fine. My point is...while it may seem like a very dressy place to some, if you're a bit casual...no worries.   Decor was really nice, clean and simple. Thankfully being that there were a few local events happening that night, finding a seat at 8:30pm was easy (despite not having reservations). I opted for the bar, which ultimately was a mistake.   Service (for me) was lacking! One seat a way was a couple who I imagine had some affiliation to the restaurant (i.e.; owner, frequent patron, friend of the owner, etc.). Everyone... chefs, servers, managers, other diners at the bar and those working the bar seemed so engrossed with their every need. Before their glasses of wine was done bartenders were waiting to pour more. They received great treatment, but as a result it unfortunately seemed that I (a paying diner) was an afterthought.   I had to call the bartender over so I could order a drink. When my glass of water finished, no one offered a refill. When my cocktail was done, not once did anyone check if I wanted to order another. Even complimentary bread (which others received) wasn't offered. Upon finishing my meal, I wasn't asked if I'd like to see a dessert menu.  As a frequent diner at casual and fine dining establishments, I found several things to be unacceptable. Although the food was fine....the service received left me disappointed.",

We went with the Bruschetta Caponata and the Eggplant Parm al Forno for the apps.  The bruschetta was just eh; okay to eat but would not order again (it had ricotta and olives on sesame toast).  The eggplant on the other hand was fantastic; it also came with a small side salad with peppadew peppers and I could have eaten an entire plate of the salad alone.  Cannot recommend the eggplant appetizer enough.   The pasta we ordered was the Pasta al Nero it came with lump crab, mussels and colossal shrimp in a spicy (but not too spicy) red sauce.  Do not be scared off by the $25 price tag- it is worth every penny if not more.  I will be going back to Aria for this pasta alone!  The atmosphere inside was nice but not too stuffy/intimidating.  The staff was very friendly and we told the waitress we were going to be sharing everything and they divided all of our orders in two plates when bringing everything out.  We also had the Mojito Italiano which was a fun twist on the mojito and will def order again!",

First thing to note is that the atmosphere was very clean and crisp.  I very much enjoyed the live music that was playing and was actually surprised that they were there as I wouldn't have pegged this place for live music.    Our service was impeccable.  This young man was very prompt, professional, and had very calm way about him that made everyone feel at ease.  For beverages I had tried the Toasted Biscotti and it was delicious.  For appetizers we had the gnocchi, calamari, and  the flat bread pizza.  All were yummy and especially the gnocchi.  The butteriness and texture were amazing.  The pizza was average at best and didn't add much to the experience.    I ordered the pork flatiron with cauliflower puree. In the puree they had golden raisins.  I was a bit put off by this at first but then was shocked that it tasted amazing! The only thing I would ask would've been a bit more of the sauce in the pork, which was extremely tender.   Great experience.",

My friend ordered the mushroom pizza with goat cheese and it was absolutely amazing! I loved it. The NY strip was horrible! I asked for it medium and it looked well done. The taste was so bland and just awful! I sent it back and got the butternut squash ravioli instead which was decent, but not the best. I was pretty disappointed. It was a little greasy and kind of boring. The tiramisu was very good, but paper thin and only about one bite. It was sadly small. We waited 35 minutes for our desserts. This was after the restaurant slowed down and everything. It was very upsetting. It was late, a work night, and I hated the wait. It made me not really want to try it again.",

They really have never made a big deal about if I want a table or the bar and leave it up to me to chose.  Their bread service is the best part of the meal.  They serve warm, crusty baked french bread with a white bean, herb, and olive oil dip.  It is similar to hummus but WAY better.     The first time at Aria, I had a seasonal scallop and gnocchi dish which I was sad that they had taken off of the menu this past time but it is great that they change their menu seasonal.  This past visit, I stuck with a classic - chicken parmigiana.  The chicken was lightly pan friend and had fresh mozzarella on top.  It is served with pasta, sauce, and spinach.  I loved the addition of spinach into this dish.  It was a huge meal, two large pieces of chicken and I could only eat one.  It would be great to split or great leftover if you aren't traveling.",

The bar tenders were very attentive with my order, refilling my water and wine glass. The wine list was loaded with great wines at a reasonable cost, I went with the montepulciano wine.  For dinner I got the Eggplant Parmigiana and a shaved kale salad, combination was exactly what I was looking for and the size was plenty for one person.

    "text": "In town for the Game of Thrones Live? The only logical place to eat before the show is Aria.   But really, we obviously hit a local favorite. My date and I went in on a Thursday evening around 6 o'clock. The place wasn't packed, but all of the tables were reserved and the wait time was about an hour. Not enough time for that. The hostess informed us the bar was open seating so we jumped in while we could.   The bar Staff was attentive, even though we only had one glass of wine between the two of us. Within 10 minutes of us sitting down, the place was FILLED. There were customers standing to eat, in the waiting area, all tables were full, etc. We arrived at the perfect time.   We skipped on the appetizers since we saw some delicious sounding deserts. She ordered the salmon and I ordered the Kale salad and butternut squash Ravioli.  The Salad was great, it was a lot bigger than I was expecting and was dressed really well.   Our entrees tasted really great too. The portions were pretty small though. My ravioli came with 7 or 8 pieces. The taste almost made up for it, it literally tasted like a holiday meal all in one plate.   Her salmon was about half the size of most places, but she really enjoyed it.   After our entrees we had to try the Tiramisu. It was pretty awesome. You could tell it was homemade. Thick mascapone with a heavy espresso kick with the lady fingers. Again, the serving size was really small, it's hard to get the full experience of the deserts if you are sharing them.  Overall, Arial was a good experience. The Staff was great, bathrooms were clean, and the food tasted good.  The negatives: To appear as a romantic restaurant, it gets really loud, even away from the bar area. The food portions are really small for the high prices.  For a salad, two entrees, desert, and a glass of wine I paid $73 after tip. Would I visit again? Maybe if I am in  Charlotte with a larger budget.",

It's probably the only reason I gave this a four instead of three when thinking of having to balance.  Why? Well, I'm from New York... home of more Italians than most of the rest of the world. This means that I'm a bit pickier about Italian food.  So, while the food isnt bad or anything, it just isnt amazing. I'd expect more from a place that looks and acts this good.

    "text": "Luxxxe decor-wise but a tad flat nosh-wise. Maybe my expectations were a teensy bit high, or I need to go back for dinner?  I've had Tuscan-style pies that didn't resemble Tostino's quite as much as these, really, flatbreads, do - so dry, so unleavened, no chew, no bend, that the cracker takes over and there's crumbs flying everywhere, and taking a bite is work. Got the distinct feeling these were preformed and chilled somewhere, waiting to be covered with other prepared-this-early-morning toppings, the hope being that the oven would bring the mushrooms back to life (not so much).  Harsh. I know they can do better. But staring at that gorgeous bar, feeling so comfy-comfy on the couch, made the little mediocrities stand up and yell in my face. Despite the reasonable lunch prices and decent service.",

    "text": "Food: 2 - 2.5 stars Decor/Vibe/Service: 3.5 - 4 stars  After my second trip here for dinner last night, I have to echo the general theme of reviews for Aria: cool vibe, great decor, really average food (at best). I also have to echo the desire to want to like this place, because I really do...it's a bummer that the food's just so mediocre.   That said, I've specifically been disappointed by:     -  The wine list: yes, they do offer a wide variety, but their by the glass selection is much less diverse. I realize it's an Italian restaurant (and so my desire for a sweeter/less dry white may fall on deaf ears) but it would be nice if they offered something on that end by the glass (not a glass of Riesling, Gruner Veltliner or Semillon to be seen...although they did offer bottles of each of these).       -  The Pork Chop with Brussels Sprouts, Caramelized Apple, Mustard Balsamic Sauce: all around, I was just bored by this dish. The balsamic sauce gave the apples a little bit of a weird flavor, and the pork chop was either not cooked very well or was just not a good pork chop to begin with...not sure which. And the Brussels sprouts...where do I begin? I'm currently in the midst of a love affair with this vegetable, so believe me when I say I've tried them at more than a few restaurants in various cities over the past year or two. I've now been severely disappointed by them twice at Aria, and will NOT be ordering them again. Usually, Brussels sprouts in restaurants blow my home-made versions out of the water (much to my chagrin), but the chef at Aria saw fit to overcook and under season them, for reasons that I cannot fathom.    - The Chocolate Hazelnut Cake with Hazelnut Gelato & Vanilla Cream: A few Yelpers were big fans of this dessert, but I found it very...blah. The gelato was super whatever, and the cake was...just cake. It wasn't bad at all, and I do think the texture was good...moist and everything. But I seriously had no desire to finish it, which is unusual for me as I'm normally the \"lick the dessert plate clean\" type.   Also had the Penne a la Vodka, which was fine but again nothing to write home about.   The one thing that I will say was legitimately good and I would order again is the Mascarpone Cheesecake with Strawberry Sauce; if feel the need to come to Aria despite what you've read here on Yelp, get this dessert, because it might be the only good thing you have all evening. The mascarpone cheese just gives it this divine texture...yum. But seriously, I would save your $$ and skip Aria altogether.",

I have been back at least three times since and it's always underwhelming.  I have had the short ribs, the osso buco, the margherita pizza, the grilled chicken panini (probably the best thing I have had there), and gnocchi (which was actually very, very good), and each time I leave thinking the food was good but not great.  Last night, I was there with a group of minds that I greatly respect. I think we were all in agreement. Decor is great.  Location can't be beat.  Vibe is good, even if the place seems to be populated with the typical cast of bankers.  But the food is just good.  Nothing special.  Blame the market I guess.  Maybe there is too much risk to step outside the usual.  But I sure wish someone would try, and you would think a successful chef would have the confidence and the backing to do it.    Oh well.  I'm sure I'll go back. But at least I'll know what I'm getting.",

MY finance got the the crudo which he enjoyed but his braised short ribs required a knife to be cut and  the brussel sprouts were under cooked.

I want Aria to be my go-to late night quick bite meal place (yay $5 plates)  But...  The bar service is atrocious! Seriously, the people are so snooty and rude it's hard to believe when it's happening!  My friend and I came in at about 8pm to have a cocktail and grab a few apps. My friend started to order a drink and the young female bartender barked at her to show her an ID - to which she obliged. Before I was even able to order (as I was still perusing the menu) she told me to show her an ID. I get it - ok- we look young, my friend is 22 and I am 25, but geez wait 2.5 seconds for me to pick out a drink! So I said I needed a moment to decide what I wanted. A few seconds later instead of asking me what I decided on, she demanded an ID again- I showed her it and then asked for a glass of Prosecco.   I had to track down someone for a glass of water - and to put an order in. At no time did anyone smile at us or even offer us service...there was maybe 10 people at the bar and 2 servers (and a manager? behind the bar).   We ordered four dishes- which were dropped down in front of us without a word - we were not asked if we wanted anything else or if everything tasted ok. The bartender had no problems smiling at the men dressed in suits but treated us with a serious chill.   I want to go back - because I enjoy the food (and have always had good table service) but seriously learn how to treat customers at the bar! I am a New Yorker and you make us look like rainbow bright and her crew of my little ponies.",

It's got a very large store front and signage, so it's hard to miss. Immediately upon entering, I was impressed with their service. I had booked my reservation online and entered in a note about my visit. The hostess welcomed me and made reference to the online reservation note, which was definitely a first. We were seated in the second floor for a more intimate dining experience.  Two of us ordered the express lunch option which was only $9. The portions were appropriate for a lunch serving, but definitely smaller than you would get with the full meal. You get a salad, main course, and dessert with this option.  I ordered the NC trout and was pleased with both the taste, preparation, and presentation. If you're in Uptown Charlotte and looking for an easy, tasty, and enjoyable meal, then I'd recommend giving Aria a shot.",

I liked that they had complementary valet parking too. The food itself was decent. I had the steamed mussels as an appetizer and this was actually really good. I got it with the white wine sauce. My fiance had the Margherita pizza, and there wasn't anything separating it from your average pizza, taste or presentation wise. The meals themselves were average in my opinion. There are certain things worth critiquing. My fiance had the penne Ala vodka and added chicken. When it came out it was just a chicken breast on top of the pasta, and not mixed in. Not to mention they charged almost $5 for this piece of chicken. My meal was good. I had the lamb bolognese. The only thing I didn't like was that the lamb wasn't the prominent part of the dish. I was expecting some decent pieces of lamb, but instead is was grounded and mixed in with the red tomato sauce with the pasta. The desserts were good, my fiance really enjoyed the hazelnut cake. I have been to better Italian restaurants in Charlotte, but I may come back here for lunch one day if I'm in the area in the future.",

    "text": "Aria has just opened within the last week or two, but it has none of that clumsy new-restaurant feeling. Being part of the Sonoma Restaurant Group they must have drawn on the experience of Press, Sonoma, and Pie Town to pull off a flawless opening. Upon first entering and confirming our reservation the maitre d' politely whisked our coats off to the coat check. That's the sort of thing than sometimes slips at a new place, but was very much appreciated.  The decor was modern but comfortable, with low-backed white leather chairs abound. Outside was Charlotte's first snowstorm of the year, and inside felt as cozy as you could want. Our waitress hurried over immediately with menus, a wine list, and a bottle of water. Very prompt. We decided on a bottle of wine, and dithered over our food choices. The waitress checked back with us several times to see if we were ready, but it never felt like she was rushing us. We actually ordered (and received) our appetizers before deciding on our main course - an unusual route - but she was fine with it.  I used to think that all the world's bruschetta should be like the little Italian place I used to visit as a kid, but I've learned that every restaurant does it differently. At Aria, it was VERY different. The thickly sliced bread was covered with olives and thick ricotta cheese - nothing like what I had expected, but fantastic all the same.  Our main courses, once we had chosen them, were just as good. Being a bit of a pig, I ordered both a pasta course (Primi) and a meat course (Secondi). My girlfriend, wisely, had only one. I started with the risotto, which was richer than I ever imagined. The goat cheese was intensely awesome, and I started regretting my decision to order two entrees. But then the salmon came out and my regrets evaporated. It's so hard to find good (non-fried) fish in Charlotte, and these guys nailed it. Medium-rare grilled salmon on a bed of even more risotto. I had dreams about it that night.  So we loosened our belts, paid our bill, and picked up our unfinished bottle of wine. The dinner may have ended, but we still had plans. I had heard that there was a lounge upstairs, and we wanted to check it out. We scooted up the stairs at the back of the restaurant and found a lounge that looked exactly like the restaurant below. This is where Aria's newness became evident. They had envisioned the upstairs \"lounge\" as a semi-separate bar - it has a different name printed on its windows - but it wasn't drawing in any business on its own. Part of the problem may have been the very accessible bar downstairs with the main restaurant, which I found to be more inviting. We felt sort of abandoned upstairs on our own. If it were busier that would help, but it would take a lot of people to fill such a large space. Also, bizarrely, the upstairs bar opened onto the brightly lit but thoroughly closed Founder's Hall of the Hurst Tower. I guess they hope to bring in the banking lunch crowd, but at night it was like drinking in an abandoned shopping mall. When they sort out their vision of the upstairs bar, I'll revise this review - likely to 5 stars.",

After reading a few Yelp reviews, I requested the Chef's table, which is located in an alcove with a view of the kitchen. It's a different and cool experience to see everything going on behind the scenes. Most entrees are between $15 and $30. There's a large wine selection with bottles around $30-40. Some people have noted that the portions are small, but I felt they were perfectly sized. Everyone at our table finished their meal and had room for dessert, but any larger and we would have asked for boxes. Here's the thing: this is not Maggiano's. Do not go into this restaurant expecting huge shareable portions. But every dish was cooked perfectly and delivered flavor I don't think I could get elsewhere. The server was extremely helpful and attentive and the kitchen staff worked hard. I definitely suggest this place for a special date night or a nice dinner. And definitely request the Chef's table (it seats 6) if you like to experience something different.",

    "text": "Snobby Service!  I came here to listen to music in the bar.  Shortly after we arrived, we were briefly acknowledged by the hostess, seated ourselves (which is fine), but then we were ignored for 20 minutes.  Fed up, I went up to the bar to order our drinks.  The bartender wouldn't even look at me and I had to walk back and forth around the bar to get his attention.  He was not even doing anything!  The drinks took about 10 minutes and they were just draft beers.  I ordered a tiramisu from the waitress, who finally showed up after about 45 minutes.  The dessert arrived after 30 minutes.  I have never seen such a pathetic tiramisu.  It was smaller than a piece of toast and about 1/2\" thick.  This place is ultra yuppi-ish and frankly, I think the reason for the bad service was because we rode there on bicycles, but I was dressed pretty much like everyone else in the restaurant.  What a bunch of snobs!  I wish I hadn't left a tip, too.  I won't come back again to this place.  Watching the parade of yuppies going in and out of the place was entertaining, though.",

    "text": "We had plans for dinner and a Broadway show and originally wanted to stop by Coco Osteria. Unfortunately, they were booked so I made reservations for Aria. While not one to try new restaurants with too much optimism, we decided to give Aria a try.   Consistent with most previous reviews, Aria's broad menu of contemporary Tuscan fare was spot on. For starters, we ordered steamed mussels which was amazingly fresh. The portion was just right... generous but not too much. This was a good thing as we then had the main course, which was papparadelle pasta with braised duck ragu for me and grilled salmon for her. Both dishes were competently prepared, well portioned and really good.   To finish our meal, we split two desserts a chocolate hazelnut cake and mascarpone cheesecake. While both were delicious, the chocolate hazelnut cake won our vote hands down (and I'm not even a chocolate lover).   Definitely coming back here and with more success could become one of our regular restaurants.",

    "text": "The food was average, the atmosphere was very nice. I hate the Olive Garnden, but I think the food may be better. Dont get me wrong, the Wine list is great-but isnt everyone's? I expect a tuscan grill will have larger portions and some TASTE. So from a value perspective, not worth it.  I gave it a shot for lunch and I was disappointed by the handful of arugala and small end piece of salmon. Again, decent, but not worth the price. I felt like i was in a Tapas bar, not a Tuscan Grill. Seriously, when the name Olive Garden shows up anywhere in your reviews, you have problems.  BTW  its soooo obvious that affiliates of this establishment feel the need to publish reviews on this site. Too bad they forgot to pad the reviews on urban spoon. oops. Good luck and I hope you listen to your clients- or you won't survive in such a small market.",
