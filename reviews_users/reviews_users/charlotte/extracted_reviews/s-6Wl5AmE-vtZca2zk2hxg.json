But sirloin was med rare as ordered and quite tender.  Fried pickles were the bomb!  Left little room for dessert and that was a bad decision.

The sheltered nature of the outdoor patio made it comfortable to sit outside even on a cool night.  (I won't be redundant about the wrought iron chairs!)  Place was busy on a Wednesday night - always a good sign - with a lot of what appeared to be office work attire on the patrons.  Bad first omen - no draught beer!!  Seriously, are you even allowed to call yourself a bar if you only serve bottled beer?  Or perhaps this place is trying to stand out from all the rest serving the micro-brew de jour on tap?  So the beer is a definite opportunity for improvement.  The food on the other hand was plentiful, tasty and satisfying.  The fried pickles were a bit too spicy for my companion but I thought they were great.  Burgers are not as good as The Liberty but they aren't as pricey either.  Overall, nice value for price paid.  By the time we'd finished our meal, space had opened up on the comfy sofa nearest the fireplace.  Gas log I believe but with the wood stacked on either side, you could convince yourself it's real.  So one more drink, fabulous company, good conversation on the patio near the fireplace - and I was late getting home!  Our server said they are opening another location in Weddington.  Maybe draught beer at this location - please????",

    "text": "Char Bar No. 7 could very well be poised to steal the \"Best Burger in Charlotte\" crown from The Liberty.  I felt the need for a burger, and wanted to try somewhere new, so CB7 is what was decided.  I was skeptical of the hokey name - and the steer antlers on the wall - but was quite surprised by the quality this place is putting out.  As others have said, they do have a very elegant patio, which you walk through to get to the restaurant proper.  Wrought iron tables on one side, couches and a huge stone fireplace on the other.  Inside has more of the traditional western bar feel: dark wood, \"aged\" wall decor, and plenty of cowboy-type things.  The bar area is pretty big (and pretty noisy), and there is also a dining room as well.  We started with the appetizer of the night, a charred portabello mushroom. It had that great smoky, open flame quality that surprisingly did not overpower the delicate, mellow flavor of the mushroom. Everything meshed well with the tomato, feta, and arugula that came with it.  My burger was perfectly cooked, with a warm pink interior and loads of juicy flavor, just how I prefer it. A rich, toasted bun helped solidify the sandwich, and my particular burger (there are plenty to choose from) came loaded with lettuce, tomato, onion, and fried pickles.  Yes, fried pickles - could it get any better?  Indeed it can! There is a great selection of NC beers to wash it down with.  Our server was spot-on, and the service manager personally followed up with every table.  Seeing as how I only had one of their many burger options, I think it's safe to say I'll be back to sample through the rest of the menu.",

Clearly pushing us out and it was embarrassing to my friend who hadnt finished.  Ill go back but next time I won't allow our very nice experience to be short changed.

You eat well -- our food was hot, prompt and plentiful. Rita's Quesadillas were prepared just the way she specified . . . and enough to take home for another meal. My hamburger was de - lishus! and I actually finished off the whole thing. I can put this place in the running for the best burger in Charlotte.  The after work crowd had not yet arrived, so there was plenty of room on the patio so we could enjoy a beautiful summer day in the high 70s.  But there's got to be a thorn among the roses -- right? It's the chairs. Char Bar needs to put steel sliders on the feet of the wrought iron chairs. They scrape screeching painfully every time someone gets up or down. Other than that one fault, they were very comfortable. with big, thick seat cushions.  I'll give this one four stars and come back often.",

Now, I realize it was SuperBowl Sunday and lots of people were ordering wings - that doesn't mean you send out sub-par items. We ordered a lot - 3 different flavors, around $40-45 worth. None of the flavors had sauce, and I mean zip. They all tasted the same, and quite a few were on the fence between done and maybe.......? Didn't want to ruin our party by having them take the wings back, but will not be eating here again thanks to this experience.",

We didn't get seated until more than an hour passed and when seated no one came over to take drink orders. I had to go find someone for a waitress. The food took more than 30 minutes to arrive and by now it's past 9:30 PM and half the restaurant is empty. The manager came to table to apologize for the amateur service and she said she'd comp some meals or at least parts of the meals. NO SUCH COMPS WERE GIVEN and an 18% gratuity was added to all checks. I've visited many restaurants in Charlotte in 24 years of living here but this is among the top 10 worst experiences I've ever had. My impression is that no one on the staff really cared what happened to us and the manager's attitude pretty much cemented that view.",

One of the coolest things is the sweet front patio where there is a wood burning fireplace and many fans to extend the outdoor dining season in both directions. There are huge, comfortable couches around the fireplace. Also they've got a huge garage door for a front wall that can be opened on good days for an outdoor experience.  I'd go back tomorrow",

Well it may be the best but not for someone who likes red meat: the barmaid said medium well or medium only.   Ok, so I ordered the rib-eye sandwich one more time. The meat was plentiful for a sandwich and very tender too. Being able to chose a pretty good mushroom risotto as the side was a bit of a treat so all's good ...   ...with the exception that after having spent 6 months in Charlotte $14 for a steak sandwich seems kind of expensive. Plus I didn't get to try their burger cooked how *I* like it. Almost forgot this : their \"first things first\" drink special doesn't for allow any substitutions . Could you please leave out the Koolaid ?.... \" No, that's the way they come\"   m'kay.",

Very nice patio and very roomy inside.  Great for groups  We had ribeye steaks, which though cooked as we ordered could have come from your local chain supermarket.  And were they SALTY!  Must be the way they get flavor in their so-so meat.  Cassidy was our wait person and she was really good, friendly and helpful in how to order the sides we wanted to try and split so as to fit into the \"comes with\" price.    Baked potato was also SALTY as I ate the skin...big mistake and I really felt queezy with all the salt from the meat and the potato.  Asparagus was grilled, which was good, but a skimpy portion of those skinny things.  House salad was not so good because we ordered the balsamic vinaigrette dressing which was very heavy and powerful  They do not make their own dressings and it showed.  Beer was good.  Prices were far too high for the quality of what is served.  Not a place we will return to, even though it is very convenient to where we stay.  Too bad.",

From the food to the service it's become our favorite place in the area.  Food- We've tried a variety of things off the menu and have been beyond satisfied and pleased with it all. The only thing that didn't wow my mouth was the turkey burger, it wasn't bad per say but if you're going to get a burger get the real meat deal!! The CB7, Charleston, Southwestern, Leap Year and Cali burger are all fantastic. The pretzel appetizer is the best pretzel app around. All of their sides are phenomenal too.  Drink-They have good daily drink (and food) specials and a decent selection of craft beers. Their signature cocktails are hands down some of the tastiest I've had. I usually get the John Daily (sweet tea vodka and lemonade) or the cucumber mint cocktail made with vodka and gin!   Ambiance- I love, love, LOVE the outdoor patio (covered and heated in the winter). It is like being an a gigantic outdoor living room. The fact that they have multiple games showing on the many tv's is awesome, it is our go to place for Sunday football. The bathrooms are always clean and it's a good home away from home when a cocktail is needed or i want a burger.  Service- Hands down a huge reason we keep coming back. Everyone is so friendly and helpful and even if there is a mess up (which doesn't happen often) you won't even care cause they take such good care of you here. Derek is our favorite, he is just the biggest sweetheart like even if he isn't our server, you can't not be in a good mood when he is around cause he just is so positive and upbeat. Brianna is another favorite!",

For the second time my burger was overcooked - not slightly this time, but way overcooked.  If you are unable by law or unwilling to cook a burger to medium, just fess up and I'll order chicken.  My order of a brisket burger ($12), which I asked for medium, came out as well and dry.  Dry, tasteless.  The onions were undercooked.  The tater tots as a side were fine.   Service was again excellent and we sat out on the patio which had a nice breeze and made for easy conversation.  But the service and amenities don't make up for the apparent consistently overcooking of beef.  Pass.",

Then it took forever for us to get drink refills, I had to ask the hostess. We still had to wait for drink refills after this, but ok. Then, after a very long time our food finally came out. It was cold. The server/bartender never came to ask us how things were, and pretty much tossed the box on the table that I asked for.

    "text": "I've been passing by this place for a long time and have always noticed it out of the corner of my eye whilst on my way to Southpark. It's an interesting little location that kind of juts out of the strip of businesses. True to the bar n' grill scene, Char Bar 7 is a good location in a pinch.   Ample bar seating in this place. There is a larger dining room, but we decided to have dinner in the lounge. The service was friendly. Nothing above and beyond. Most of the younger servers seemed a little inconvenienced to be there, but hey, it was a Saturday night. Started with the pretzels and they were just right. I like the addition of parmesan to the top and not just razor-sharp salt crystals. The cheese dip was nice and stood out from many others I've had as of late. Not the standard American cheese or beer cheese. This was made from, what tasted like, white cheddar or white American with nice pimiento and pepper chunks. Really dig the flavor these had. I'd order these again.   I ordered the Leap Year. Burger, bacon, cheese, and a fried egg. Got the bleu cheese slaw on the side. Neither were amazing by any stretch but had a nice touch. If you order a burger without a bun, it is served on a piping hot castiron skillet. Seriously...watch out for that stuff. It was hotter than Hades. I almost scorched my mouth with the first bite. The burger tasted just fine and I ate about half of the slaw. My wife ordered the mushroom risotto on the side of her veg burger. It was nice, but just like other risottos. Creamy, heavy, and a nice filler.   Major downside is the lacking draught beer. This place would be a 4 in my book if they had some locals on draught being switched out on the regular. I ordered the John Daly cocktail and it was great. Sweet tea vodka, lemonade, and a few other mixers. Nice, but too fruity and a longshot from a beer to work with my burger.   I will say that the patio is amazing. SO nice for the winter time. They have a cozy lounge with a fireplace and couches, completely enclosed and heated. Take that, cold air! I'd love to come back and just chill on the patio with some pretzels and another John Daly!  3.5 for sure. Cheers!",

    "text": "We stopped in here for lunch while in the area doing some serious retail therapy.  I had done a quick Yelp search and Char Bar No 7 seemed like the perfect place for a decent, quick lunch.    The menu was pretty large, with burgers being the star and plenty of ways to customize their burgers.  I got the Classic burger but made it a turkey burger for only $1 more.  The options for sides were fries, tater tots, or onion rings.  Anyone who knows me knows I'm a sucker for a breaded and fried onion, so I went with the rings.  My sister got the sweet potato tater tots, and I kind of wish I had looked at the menu more to see they were an option.  The turkey burger itself was cooked perfectly and was plenty juicy and flavorful.  I asked the waitress if they were made in house.  She said they weren't but that they add an in-house seasoning blend to the outside of it before they cook it.  She also said that the turkey burger is what she gets for lunch every day and it was easy to see why.  The onion rings were a let down, though.  They were scrawny, thin onion slices with a breading that was a bit too peppery for my tastes.  I'm also super picky when it comes to onion rings, so maybe that's just my issue.   Even though we weren't there to watch any football games, it was nice how they had the helmets of the teams playing underneath the TV so you could easily see which games are on which screens.  The service was really quick and we were back on the road to shop some more in no time.  For what we were looking for, Char Bar definitely delivered.",

We're officially breaking up for good this time.  The last few times the food was barely edible. Tonight, the blue cheese Coleslaw was rancid. My husband and I both had it as a side item. We brought it to the attention of our waiter and he sent the manager over. She proceeded to tell us that the KM (thanks for the jargon) tried it and it was fine. I suggested that if she was familiar with how it was to taste for her to try it. She left pretty hastily and then come back and  said she tried it and the bar back (thanks again) did too and it was fine. She explained it's made with real blue cheese crumbles. Well, maybe so but those crumbles tasted like they had been left out in today's 80 degree weather.  She offered to take it off our bill. I appreciate that but the food and attitude are enough to make me take my money elsewhere. Eater beware!",

Between my boyfriend and I, we got the buffalo chicken dip, southwestern salad and southwestern burger....southwestern happened to be our theme. And it was very tasty. And the portions were huge. We had so many leftovers.  I would definately come back and watch a game here. Very cool place.",

    "text": "If at all possible I try to eat twice at a restaurant before I review their food... I've been able to eat at CharBar 7 twice in the last week and I am afraid my review isn't very positive.  On the plus side the service here is generally very good. The bartenders and hostesses are friendly and the waitstaff is attentive and their opinions on the beer selection are well considered and insightful.  My biggest issue is with the food... Earlier this week I tried a steak and it was fine but it was not a $21 dollar steak. It was a steak I could have done just as well at home for a quarter of the price. The cut lacked marbling and it was underseasoned. It was good to see brussel sprouts but they lacked a good charred or smoky flavor.  Later in the week I tried the fried chicken thighs on their tailgate menu and a Big Pit(?) burger, a burger with pulled pork, fried pickles and bbq sauce.   The three chicken thighs covered in white gravy were delicious, no question. Unfortunately they were all undercooked, each one bloody at the bone. Curiously onr thigh had the complete thigh joint as well as part of the leg bone... The gravy was great and if it were cooked correctly it would have been a winner.  The burger was ridiculously thick and overly salted. The fried pickles were gummy and the tomato was completely lost in the mishmash of flavors.   I also tried their homemade chips for the second time and again they were bland, limp and chewy. They need to be half as thick and cooked to order.   If the prices were more in line with a typical tavern I wouldn't be so critical but they are asking top dollar for food that is done better at half a dozen places in town for 25%-50% less.",

    "text": "Hopefully fellow Yelper's will read this and save themselves the heartache of eating at this place.   Planned a lunch with a buddy today (Fri), arrived at 12 sharp. Parking lot is slammed but oddly the restaurant was fairly quite. Once we figured out what door to use we were  \"greeted\" by the host or manager, he did the whole \"pick a spot\" routine. We picked the large dining hall, which was mostly empty, and he placed us (of course) directly next to the kitchen exit.  First off, the place stinks of mold and has that gross egg smell. Everything is old, poorly cared for and frankly painfully underwhelming. I wasn't expecting the Ritz but for a $40 meal (no alcohol or desert) I at least expect it be on par with a Chili's.  After 7-10 minutes our server blessed us with her presence. She was obviously thrilled to be working and her demeanor was that of a Waffle House server at 2am, on a Wed.  She tossed in the \"honey\" and topped that off with several \" you boys\" (added bonus as we are 40/50 yo, and she was 20 ish), the \"boy\" comments continued thru the meal.  My buddy (AKA Boy #2) ordered a half order of fried pickles. Upon receipt, I was very happy I had not done the same. The pickles were these awkward butchered wedges with goopy breading half falling off. He ate two and slid it to the corner. As we aren't one to complain I had assumed she would notice the plate was noticeably untouched but it was snatched up without comment.   My burger arrived, a Southwestern, at roughly 6\" tall it was impossible to eat. After tossing off enough lettuce to kill a guinea pig, de-coring the tomato slice and repositioning the balance of the fixings I began my journey down the rabbit hole.......best verbiage, yuck. Best thing was the bread. The meat had a gamey taste to it, the fried jalapenos were balls of gross breading, truthfully I am making myself sick talking about it.  Boy #2's chicken sandwich was equally mediocre and was accompanied with some type of rice pilaf (dare I say WTF, who designed this menu). He inundated it with the crusty mayo that was brought to the table 25 minutes before we ate. They may prove to have been a bad idea and doubled the E-coli \"Russian roulette\" we played by even staying here.  Our server gathered up the 2/3's of the meal we didn't eat, without a question of why so much wasn't eaten (likely standard practice). We paid and left.  Long story short, this place is on Carmel road, there are plenty of other choices. SKIP THIS ONE.",

I had read Ben's review while waiting for the appetizer to appear. I was hoping that there would be an improvement.  I ordered a bomber sandwich with onion rings for my meal. My wife ordered a dozen teriyaki wings. She was happy with her meal. I was actually surprised by mine. I wasn't expecting anything more than average, but the meal exceeded expectations.  The first thing I noticed about the bomber was that the bread seemed off in some way. I seemed as though it was falling apart & that the bottom of the sandwich was on top. I flipped the sandwich over & discovered that it was breaded with two giant pretzels! Very unique! The shaved ribeye was very good & though the sandwich was the messiest thing I'd ever eaten I thought it was very good.  The onion rings looked like they had a lot of breading but it was deceptive. When I took a bite out of one I discovered that the onion ring inside was doubled up. They were very tasty too. I finished the meal off with a slice of Creamsicle cheesecake. It was very good. The flavors were not overwhelming. We both had sweet tea & our server Taylor always made sure that we had plenty to drink. We will return.",

For starters, The last 2 times, we have waited 20min+ just to get our first round of drinks, which have been wrong. On top of that, the wait for apps and dinner compiles to about an hour and isn't very smooth.  The quality of wings has been one of my favorites in Charlotte area behind moosehead and providence road sundries up until recently. Not sure if they switched cooks or how their kitchen operates on a daily basis, but clearly something has been off.   It is safe to say, we will be taking an indefinite break from wing night at Char Bar. 0 stars would be applicable to most recent visit.",

We also really liked the beer cheese dip that came with the pretzels, but the pretzels needed to be baked longer in order to be crispy and warmed through.  Great service from Darion though.  Favorite drink: Blood Orange Margarita!",

Unfortunately,  I didn't realize that this was a dog friendly restaurant,  and the porch began filling with pop parties with dogs. I'm very allergic to dogs,  so I was forced to move indoors where it was freezing! The food was excellent.  The fish and chips were very good.  I had a smothered chicken breast and it was juicy and well prepared.  The brussel sprouts with bacon are also excellent.  The waitress checked on us often.  I couldn't complain about the service.  I'm really tried of having to lose my seats to dogs everywhere.  They don't tip... maybe I shouldn't either of I have to lose a good table over them.  Stay home Fido!",

They are made mini spear style, perfectly breaded and fried, and come with THE best spicy sauce!  The main bartender is the BEST in town, and I say that with conviction!  The managers and waitstaff are great and very attentive and accommodating.  The patio is an enclosed patio that is warm, cozy and inviting...couches, huge fireplace and lots of TVs for your favorite games!  Best of all, they are DOG FRIENDLY!!!!!  Thank you Char Bar!  You're my favorite go to hotspot in Pineville.  Upscale bar atmosphere that is family friendly as well as great bar for adults.  Keep up the good work and please continue to keep your great staff!",

    "text": "You know, for not being a burger aficionado, I sure have been visiting my fair share of burger style joints. I wouldn't classify CharBar so simply. Maybe an upscale grill masters go-to, but not the run of the mill burgers and fries type place.  Tonight, I visited with two colleagues after a long few days of sales meetings. It was nice to get away from the big group of coworkers for a casual meal. CharBar's atmosphere is definitely casual with an \"out and about\" flare. Nothing super fancy, jeans and tees are all good, but maybe not the ratty old ones you hide in the back of your drawer. The hosts and waiters all are clean and well kept, too. The only thing a little out of place is the sticky table. I did watch one table be bussed and the rag could have used a rotation. Otherwise, the restaurant was in good shape.  My coworkers each had the house burger with fries. The patty itself looked to be cooked to their liking  and all of the accoutrements followed their specs. I ordered the salmon (which is a local favorite) that had a sweet glaze on it. The salmon came with a salad and side, for which I selected a Caesar and sweet potato tater tots. We started with 'das pretzels and beer cheese', which were a total hit. Then my salad came and not too long after, our waitress brought our entrees.  Our waitress definitely seemed distracted and though the restaurant was full, there wasn't too much demand of her time. It would have been nice to have my water filled a bit more often. She was kind enough but not quite as hospitable as I would hope for a nice casual spot.  We all left satisfied and ultimately, didn't stick around because they were about to start Bingo. This was my second visit and I'll likely go again sometime.",

The bartender (manager?) made a point to emphasize kitchen closing to us.  She wasn't rude, but made it clear we needed to order quickly.  Our server was very cool about it, however.  She put our minds at ease and made us feel welcome to sit and enjoy our dinner.  She was super friendly the whole time; excellent customer service.  The food was nothing special, but it was good, standard bar fare.  We tried the fried pickles, the chicken quesadilla, and the salmon salad.  They were out of salmon so we subbed blackened chicken, which came out plain and a bit overcooked.  I'm picky about my manhattans and the bartender made a really good one.  Overall, not bad for being a semi-casual sports bar.  Not one of our favorite places, but would be happy to return if our friends wanted to check it out one night.",

We decided to stop in here only because we never heard of this place and seen it in passing. So we decided to give it a try. First off i  do want to mention the staff here was super friendly. I believe our waitress and the manager checked up on us over 1,000 times while we were here. Also we were shocked to sit and have a conversation with the chef as he came out to explain to us some of the items they ran out of  from the menu due to the mothers day rush earlier. I ordered the Neptune crab cake and shrimp salad, my significant other ordered the ribs. Starting out my salad the one thing about this salad i absolutely could not get enough of was the crab cake omg heaven!  The shrimp were okay nothing to brag about they weren't the normal shrimp served in the salad because again the chef explained the shortage on certain items earlier as we entered. My significant other ordered the ribs, i asked him how did he like his ribs on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the best he gave them a 4 to 5. The set up when you arrive here is really lax in the front with the front screened in patio area which was a nice touch to this what appears to be maybe a neighborhood bar.",

Nice bar/grill environment, fast and friendly staff, location to my house perfect.  I was NOT IMPRESSED with the \"chicken sandwich\" not only was it too much bread for the slither of un-flavorful chicken it was dry as saw dust, it was ONLY chicken, 3 sweet pickles and thick bread (no lettuce/tomato/sauce .  Course reading is fundamental which should have been a clue as it clearly said chicken sandwich no more or less.  My husband had the fish and chips which he enjoyed both fish and chip, not a fan of the kale slaw thou.  After reading the reviews and confirming with my coworker I will give it another try.",

Too grossed out to send it back and try again, I instead ate my sweet potato tots -- way, way too sweet for me, but I was hungry. Overnight, I began what became hours of running to the bathroom. This was still going on the next morning, and I had a meeting with clients from out of state.  Maybe it was the burger, maybe it was the tots, but it will be a long time before I give the restaurant another shot.",

I also enjoy the filet or the salmon, served on a sizzling plate! Yum! I really wish the management would think twice before allowing private parties to take entire porch.

I'm not a huge fan of the food at  the Hickory Tavern so wasn't too excited to try this reinvented venue previously a Hickory Tavern. Walking up to the entrance I noticed a substantial outside seating area with a great relaxed feel. I could definitely see hanging out with a group of people when the weather gets a bit cooler. The interior has a warm lake house feel with lots of tv visibility. My buddy and I were there for a late lunch so the restaurant was almost empty. I was most impressed with the service. Our server was fantastic. He really knew the menu well and recommend the Southwestern Burger. It was spicy and cooked to perfection. I don't eat beef often so this was a welcome treat and I'm glad that it actually met up to how the waiter had talked the burger up. He recommend getting the onion rings & that was on target as well. Fresh, made from scratch in the restaurant and they sure tasted that way. Great food, great service and a comfortable atmosphere. Looking forward to trying out the new location closer to home off of Weddington & McKee Rd!",
