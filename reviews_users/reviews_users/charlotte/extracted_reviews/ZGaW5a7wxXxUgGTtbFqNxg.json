It's refreshing to feel like you are home when you visit for the first time!",

An older woman with blonde hair took care of them before me. She had an attitude and when I asked for a Gyro she looked at me like I was talking another language. I was born in the Us and speak English very well. I honestly think she was racist because she was only being nice and friendly to white people that walked in. I'm of Latin decent and another colored woman walked in and she also gave her an attitude. This is very sad to see in such a modern world. Never coming back here again. And I didn't even try their food I threw it out.",

Then another lady picks up the phone and starts to tell me I was 30-40 minutes late picking up my order. I ask her what that has to do with me not liking the dish, so then she tells me I didn't know what it was so that why I didn't like it. Then she asks the manager and he picks up the phone saying hello hello the ask how he can help me as if I didn't just explain this to 2 other people. As I explain again he has the worst attitude I have every experienced from a restaurant. Then he tells me he is selling it like crazy, and ask what I want him to do about it, like I'm the one with the problem. I was simply calling back to ask if I would return it for a different meal. Then he tells me he is very busy and he doesn't have time to deal with this and hangs up. His name is Chris by the way, Chris is the reason I will never go back again",

The hamburgers are really good and the Greek dishes are authentic, if a little pricey.  But every time I talk my wife into giving it another chance, they consistently fail.  Last time we ate there she ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, and even though you would think for three dollars you would get at least a decent grilled cheese sandwich, they managed to put forth a sorry excuse of a sandwich that wouldn't even make the dollar menu at a fast food joint.  The sandwich had one slice of Kraft single that wasn't even melted. Pretty sad.  But there is an actual Mad Greek running the kitchen.  You can hear him yelling, and occasionally catch a glimpse of him.  I'll have to ask my relatives that are Greek just why the owner is mad.",

It seemed to be sitting for more than a day but was still creamy and well seasoned.  Pita bread was warmed on the griddle and tasted like it.  Olive amd feta were from the local grocery store at best. Gyro was well proportioned and had fresh onions, tomatoes and lettuce.  Gyro meat was days old and reheated on a griddle.  It is served with hand cut fries but they were oily and just warm.   I asked for a little extra cucumber sauce and they charged two dollars for 3 ounces. Not the best experience but not bad.  I think the proprieter would benefit a trip home to remember how Greek food is supposed to be served.  If nothing elae, jump down to Tarpon Springs FL and see how they do it there. They nickel and dime you for any extras.  This is not Greek style at all.  $25 lunch.",

The Mad Greek has a small seating area for dine-in, a patio and a take-out counter.  We went inside and just like in the movies, there were a few regulars watching football and arguing.  We took a quick look at the crazy long specials list and sat ourselves.    The waitress was ... sassy.  Definitely made the dining experience more fun.  I ordered the cheesesteak, because when you tell me that its Charlotte's best, I will try it.  My parents ordered a gyro and a kabob plate.    We got some fresh pita bread while we were waiting for our meals - it was so warm and delicious, I really wished I ordered hummus.    The food came, and the cheesesteak was definitely one of the better, more Philly-type cheesesteaks that I've had in Charlotte, but the cheese didn't penetrate through all of the meat, I needed a bit more.  I read a few reviews that commented on the state of the dining area - its nothing fancy, and their decor is eclectic, maybe a bit dated, but the food is good and its good value.  Pro tip: they serve breakfast all day, I need to go back & try it!",

I had the gyro plate and it reminded me of the old Chicago Greek food places that were of my youth... the best I have had since I left Chicago.  When you drive up you will be tempted to turn and go after looking at the building but don't you dare leave! If you do you'll miss out on some of the best Greek food you have ever eaten!  From the salad (which can be a meal all on its own with feta, olives, veggies, and the best tangy dressing), to the gyro (which is really a 2 person meal), to the desert (sweet sweet heaven!)... just flat out awesome!! The baclava will have you craving more and more! According to the waitress fresh made right there. It certainly tastes that way!  If the food is authentic the staff is even more so... there are the group of old Greek men sitting outside  playing backgammon and yelling in Greek (seriously that is no joke). Then the staff inside are Greek to the core!   I highly recommend trying this Blue Greek hole in the wall... be prepared to eat... you will be glad you did!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I love Greek food and I love well-run family restaurants and will choose them over a chain restaurant if given a choice.  Enter The Mad Greek....  We chose them for dinner last night based on location and Yelp reviews.  The restaurant has an old-school diner appeal.  Some of the seat cushions are in need of some TLC, but given the 96.5 sanitation rating, the owners clearly keep the place clean.  We were seated quickly and our drink orders were immediately taken.  We both ordered Gyro platters, which included a side salad, Gyro meat, and French fries.  The food arrived quickly and our orders were perfect.  The side salads were generous and there were literally chunks of yummy feta cheese to enjoy. I forgot to ask to have my dressing on the side, so I was happy to find that the house dressing didn't overpower the salad.  One of the things I judge a Greek restaurant by is the quality of the Tzatziki sauce.  The Mad Greeks is one of the best I have had!  It's thick and creamy.  The cucumber, garlic, and dill are perfectly balanced.  And they give you a nice, generous portion of it to enjoy!   The Gyro meat was well-seasoned and just delightful. The prices here are very reasonable and I will be going back in the very near future!",

Grecian style comes with fries IN the sandwich as well as on the side. We tried this style our first visit (one gyro, one chicken) and went with the regular sandwich on our second. Both styles and meats were SO good. I don't know if I even want to expand to anything else on the menu, how can we NOT get the gyro or chicken pita?  Our server on Wednesday night was a bit friendlier and more interactive than the waitress we had today. But at this point, we're hooked anyway!  10/10 would come back and I've already spread the word to my friends to add this to their must-try list!",

It's not often I am craving Greek dishes, but today I just wanted something different, and different I received. My coworker and I ordered the GYRO dinner plate of shaved beef and lamb accompanied by a Greek sidpe salad, warm pita bread , and shoe string French fries. That's a lot of food people, definitely the Greek way right? :) I opted to not get the fries, and asked for more salad (I know , who opts out of fries?) It is January, and the holiday treats are still clinging to my stomach lining (TMI?) , the fresh Greek salad was a great side to go with the savory beef and lamb, there was just so much of it I can't imagine eating fries with it. The meat was nicely seasoned, but I do admit after your hunger is satisfied it does start to taste salty and a little overly oiled (NOTE: save it for later and put it on your left over salad, great snack)    I called in my order and it was prepared quickly, the customer service was nice, I mostly likely will come back .",

If the meat is cooked on the flat grill I do not want the gyro. The Mad Greek Cafe lamb meat is cooked the traditional way, it's flavorful, tender, and juicy with a slight crisp on the edges. Tzatziki sauce was tasty, the tomatoes was fresh, the lettuce was crisp, red onions were cut perfectly thin, the darn pita bread was soft and perfectly wrapped around all the scrumptiousness.   My perfect \"cheat day\" meal!!! I've been telling so many people about this Cafe!! Awesome Job Mad Greek!!",

Then someone that I assume is related to him comes into the restaurant asking for money. This went over like you would guess. We were uncomfortable. It's gotten weird. And sad.

The place doesn't look like much from the outside...or really the inside, but it's the food you're here for. We ordered two gyro sandwich platters and were thrilled with the results. The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender, the tzitziki sauce was super garlicky and thick, and the lettuce, tomato and onion were fresh and crunch. The pita was also delicious and soft, but held up against the sandwich fillings and that makes a big difference. We left with very happy bellies and will return.",

    "text": "It's not what is on the outside that counts!!!! This place has good food for a good price. Plain and simple!  My husband always orders the Gyro Dinner. It is a lot of food. We generally have some for leftovers the next day!  I go between the Pastitsio (it's like lasagna with less red sauce and made with large Penne noodles with a Bechamel sauce on top, I love it) and the Gyro. Chris makes fresh  specials, so just ask what they have, sometimes he will bring it out and show you. On Sundays he generally does fresh vegetables the \"greek\" way (don't ask me) but my husband LOVES them!   The service is generally good, some servers are better than others. Just know that we have only seen one person waiting tables so if it is busy you may have to wait, fyi!  In general I love to go the The Mad Greek for a cheap tasty meal! If you order something to go make sure you check the meal to make sure that they include the Tzatziki (if it comes with your meal) because we have been gotten home and been REALLY upset, how do you eat Greek food with out it? We have not been to any other Greek restaurants in Charlotte so I can't compare I just know I like this place, hope you do to!",

Other than that I have nothing bad to say about \"The Mad Greek\". I have been eating here since it was \"Hugo's \" a few years back. I have tried Souvlaki dinners at many Greek establishments, but this is by far the very best. The same cook is there every time that I have eaten there over the course of 11 years. The food is consistent and that speaks volumes! I have let too many people in on this great diner, because I wanted to expose them to some food could be served in Greece lol. If you can get past the pest (which you can if you eat at any fast food restaurant) and potty before you go, you are sure to have a new favorite spot. Happy eating!",

Just the other day we gave Greek Isles one last try, and our meal was still only partially decent (we won't go back again). But then my fiance brought home some spanakopita, gyros, and a salad from The Mad Greek, and it was all terrific! Best spanakopita I've ever had- I can't stand dirty-tasting cooked spinach, and there isn't a bit of that taste in theirs! Not a ton of feta in it, but just enough nice sized chunks, along with a good garlic flavor. Even tasty the next day! The greek salad was perfect- feta was very tasty (huge feta fan, have had many, this one was great!), the dressing wasn't sweet (thankfully!), but it wasn't too tangy either. The boy said it was the best gyro he'd ever had. We will definitely be back again!",

Two of us are vegetarians one of whom can't eat gluten and one is Greek. For appetizers we had Greek fries, grape leaves, and hummus. Everything came with pita, but they brought cucumbers for the GF. For dinner we had Greek salad, Peasant salad, and rack of lamb. For dessert we tried the baklava and rice pudding. So good!  Took home lots of leftovers. Will definitely be back.",

The interiors are humble but not rich, though definitely clean! The restaurant seems to be family run and friendly. There isn't much of a Greek ambience other than a painting on one of the walls. The menu is surprisingly combines American and Greek cuisines! It's also a hefty menu so take time to go through all the dishes and ask for clarifications. Pita/gyro is always good option when you want to go safe. The dishes were served quick and they tasted alright. To sum it all up, it's not really a restaurant you would to take your date to and neither is it a restaurant to go through the Greek experience. If you want to just grab a quick bite of a Pita or gyro, this is the place. Other than that, don't expect a lot!",

It was a great open space with a TV mounted to the ceiling, but not really any sound coming out.  Lots of panoramic pics of Greece adorn the walls.  Interesting sculptures are around as well, including one outside.  The chicken kabob that I ordered came with a side salad, which was very large, and French fries.  I ordered hummus instead of the fries.  It was all tasty, but I must admit I was disappointed by the hummus.  With The Jasmine Grill setting hummus standard, as well as YAFO, they need to present their hummus in a more appealing way.  It was served in a little tiny cup, sort of like what ketchup is served in.   And I wish it was as silky as the other Mediterranean restaurants. That was my only disappointment.   It is a little hard getting into and out of the restaurant because South Blvd is so busy. All in all,  I give this two thumbs up and hope to return soon.  Great find!",

    "text": "I've been impatiently waiting to come here for some authentic Greek food and I finally got the opportunity to do it today, which just so happens to be Greek Easter!  I loved that as soon as you walk in you see a cooler full of Greek desserts, from baklava, to kataifi. The dining area is rather small and quaint. I will say it could use a little more of a \"Greek flair\". I honestly think the only thing that was missing to make the ambiance perfect was an old Greek man sitting in the corner drinking Turkish coffee with his Greek buddy, and traditional Greek music playing (the music part they can control, the old man, not so much lol)   They seemed to be short staffed, so that did affect the wait time for the food, but that didn't really bother me too much. One thing they can definitely use is a more consistent and efficient bus boy. I couldn't help but notice that they had trouble keeping the tables clear of empty plates once people were done with their food.   I ordered a frappe because I'm Greek, and I had no shame drinking it with my meal lol. It was made right with just the right amount of froth. Also, I love that they have a good selection of Greek beers and wines to choose from.   Once the food came out, it was great! The spanakopita was crunchy and fresh. I've never had spanakopita that tasted almost like a sandwich, rather than a pie. It really does work lol!   The actual entrees were just as good too. The Greek salads that came with them were hearty, and the pita bread served with it was fresh. Also, we order tzaziki and it was probably the freshest I've ever had.   I had the rack of lamb. Traditionally, it's supposed to be served with roasted potatoes or orzo, but unfortunately they only had French fries available at the time we went (around 12:30 pm). This did disappoint me a little. In all fairness , our server said they were going to have roasted potatoes later that day, and that they were still cooking them. I do appreciate the effort they take to make everything fresh. Nonetheless,  the lamb was tender and the French fries were good too. My wife really enjoyed her Greek burger as well.  Our server, which I assume is the owner or manager of the restaurant, was really nice. He even gave us eggs to play the traditional egg cracking game on Easter Sunday (Or Pascha)   I will definitely be back because traditional Greek restaurants are at a premium in Charlotte. Mad Greek has it figured out!",

The side salad that comes with this is actually large enough to be a meal by itself and their homemade salad dressing is so good that I dip their delicious pita bread, also included with the meal in it! So much good food for under $15- not sure how they do it! Make a point to eat here- I drive 50 miles one way to and it's worth the trip every time!",

The restaurant isn't pretentious but clean and the wait staff was very friendly.

The pork chops were way overcooked. Very disappointing, literally could not cut into the meat(more of a rubbery blob).  However the lamb chops were phenomenal. Some of the best i have had. The kababs were also damn good, juicy, moist, bursting with flavor. It was the shame the pork chops spoilt the entire meal. Had the baklava for desert, a bit too sweet for my liking, but pretty decent. Would have given it 4 stars if not for the overcooked pork chops.",

Even still, I looked over the menu and noticed so many options! I never knew there were so many Greek dishes! Although my options were plenty, I decided to go with the lunch time favorite, the Gyro with fries, no onions. The meat was very well seasoned and the pita and other ingredients were very fresh! I was more than happy with my selection and so were my co-workers. In fact, we have made a standing appointment on all of our calender's (invite only, haha) for what we call \"Mad Greek Thursday's\". It is always a delight and well priced ($)!  Two other things:  1) Great, welcoming environment with really great service and very nice wait staff. Outdoor and indoor seating options!  2) They make their ranch dressing in house. For ranch dressing aficionados, I hear this is some of the best ranch around. Its buttermilk based.",

They were more than accommodating! When we arrived Saturday they had the table all set and were so welcoming.   Our experience at Mad Greek was just that, an experience. The staff and owner took exceptional care of us: great explanations, recommendations, attentiveness, and a whole lot of laughing. Everything we had was exceptional, from appetizers to dessert.   One of the most unique and special restaurant experiences I've had in Charlotte (and probably most other places). Would definitely recommend to small groups and big groups alike! We'll be back!",

The pita bread was fresh and delicious and I couldn't get enough of the Tzatziki. However, for my entree I ordered the $16 Lamb Chops, and ended up getting four 1cm thick slices of gristle. Definitely NOT lamb chops in the first place, and what they gave me was 100% gristle, not a single fleck of actual meat. Completely unacceptable to serve a customer, in my opinion. They were pretty nice about allowing me to switch it out for something else, though. I got the spanakopita and it was delicious. The other people I was with got different types of gyros and everyone was pleased with their meals.",

    "text": "Like others, I was on this side of town a quiet Sunday morning...you know, when almost nothing else is open in Charlotte unless you want to positively battle the church crowd?! I was also jonesin' for a gyro and The Mad Greek (previously Hugo's Diner) seemed to be a convenient choice.   Inside, this place is definitely not much to look at. I doubt the booths or floors have been changed up since the late '80s and there was a sticky quality to the place. However, it's a diner. It's open until 4 am on the weekends, I half expected that.   Service was very friendly from the (owner - I believe) slingin' Greek greens in the kitchen to our server. As with the decor, the menu is straightforward. It's also worth noting that they do serve breakfast all day - pancakes, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, waffles, etc.   Since it was almost noon, I went with the classic gyro sandwich. A well made, soft but toasty pita filled with gyro meat, tzatizki, onions and tomato. I decided to forgo the fries and snag a greek salad for $1 more. The gyro was tasty, warm and just what I was looking for. The salad was fine but the Greek dressing wasn't my fave...even though I'm certain they make it in house.   So, with good service, good food why not 4 stars? Well, others may disagree with me, but I found it a bit overpriced for what I received. The gyro, while tasty, wasn't giant like the others I've had. For example, Steak & Hoagie shop serves up a gyro for a bit over $4...here it's moderately sized and $7.95 (including fries). Hubs and I had two gyros, one with a side salad and one with a dinner salad and it cost us $27 with tip. That seems a bit steep for just a couple of gyros and salads. Regardless, if I was in the area and seeking a gyro, The Mad Greek would be a decent stop.",

I know spanakopita is not on the list for road warriors watching their waist line, but it was the best I ever had!  No kidding.  I usually only eat half off meals on the road. Polished it off. So tasty.  Homemade too. I think that was one of my top ten best meals ever on the road for work.",

Greek food is my absolute favorite, so I had to try this authentic-looking blue and white diner on South Blvd. I ordered the gyro pita and it was AMAZING. Perfectly cooked, delicious, tender gyro meat with fantastic tzaziki sauce and a deliciously warm pita. This place stayed on my mind when I came back to Charlotte last year. Their hummus is delicious - the type of delicious where the little pool of oil forms on top and makes for a perfect gob of goodness on pita bread. Their gyro meat has never let me down. It is always the perfection I expect! Their baklava is very tasty for dessert as well, and I also enjoy the Greek salad. I've never tried their breakfast, but apparently it's served all day. When I want my top choice comfort food/the tiny Greek diner experience that reminds me of home, this place is the perfect destination in Charlotte.",

I contemplated about saving half of it for later, but what do you know, I ate the whole darn thing.  Meaty, tasty, with just enough tzatziki sauce and lettace, tomato & onion, decent portion, along with fries that's lightly seasoned (hey... I give them credit for at least trying to make standard frozen fries more appealing... not saying that they succeeded).  The gyro is one of their daily lunch specials for $6.95, other options are: cheeseburger, chicken strips, grill chicken breast sandwich, kebab/chicken/souvlaki pita, all serves with french fries.  Let me clarify that I'm mostly writing about the food because this is definitely a \"dumpy\" looking place, with minimum service, and in my opinion the menu is a little lacking and kinda pricey for a joint like this.  But for a quick lunch, it's solid and I'll be back to try the kebab pita.",

Top it all off with lettuce, tomato, onion and their (sour creme based, not my preference but still very good) tatziki sauce. FINALLY finally, a gyro worth mentioning. Fries are great as well. They are fresh cut and appear to be  tossed with some lemon and herbs. Also, delicious.  As for the ascetics of the place...it's a Greek diner. Nothing fancy and it doesn't need to be. Its good food at an affordable price, served by a friendly staff. I have not tried any thing else on the menu yet, but based on how good  the gyro is i bet other options wont disappoint. Hopefully, i will get around to it once my love affair with the gyro tapers off.",

I'm sure they have excellent other choices on their menu, but I feel like I'll be ordering their gyros every time I go there.  I've had a hard time finding gyros that I really like in Charlotte, but theirs blows away any I've had any where.  The portions on the gyro dinner were huge too,  we both left with plenty of left overs.  Now if they would just install a drive through, and stay open till one in the morning.",

Granted the place is a little rough around the edges, but I always enjoy the marinated chicken and/or ribeye with eggs.  They have solid home fries as well.  This may sound basic, but the piece de resistance of the Mad Greek is the fresh squeezed orange juice that they crank out, it's fantastic!  Best OJ this side of South Florida, stuff is like orange flavored crack in a glass!  And, if you like Greek football (aka soccer), it's on 24/7 - was there during the World Cup last year and had a blast watching it with the staff while enjoying my meal, good people.",

I cook myself all of the dishes this place serves and I have a very hard to please taste and I approve of them. From the fresh fish to the gyro meat and everything I tried, it's like i was at Lesvos island at a tavern by the beach. The owner Chris is warm-hearted (like real Greeks :D) and loads all the plates - no measuring no stinginess thats the greek spirit. At first I visited with my mom and her husband, we did not know anything about this place and we ordered a bit of everything, we had a blast. One thing i have to say is Chris needs to expel the old greek dudes often hanging out at the deck cuz theyre rowdy and i think they try to hurt his business(they make fun of him cooking in the kitchen smh). He puts his heart in this restaurant. He cooks everything himself along with another Greek guy (they both speak Greek perfectly) and he grows some of his own veggies in the back. The sweets are handmade and authentic (one time we brought a Greek walnut pie (karydopita) for him for free of course and he offered it to customers).",

Mad Greek did not disappoint! There is a brother and sister team who does the serving. They know the menu and are very friendly! In the kitchen are the elders of the family. And they are killing it back there!! We had the $16.95 appetizer sampler. It had: fresh tomatoes, feta, cucumbers, red onions, hummus, taziki, gyro meat, grape leaves, and spanakopita! Outstanding! We also shared a gyro with Greek fries! Definitely get the Greek fries! They are seasoned and topped with feta. Great flavor and not overpowering. For dessert we tried their home made Baklava... dang! That's all I can say... dang! Do not leave without a piece of Baklava! We are not from Charlotte but every time we come back to town, we will go to Mad Greek! Thank you guys!",

The pita is filled with lots of fresh meat and I love their tzatziki sauce. You definitely will not get another gyro in CLT that's loaded this much- unless it was my lucky day!   Each pita also comes with a choice of side, and I recommend the rice. It's light and fluffy- super buttery. Tip-Get an order of the hummus and mix some in with your rice! So good!   Overall, the Mad Greek is very authentic and family owned, which I love. You will always see their family members hanging out around the restaurant - and they play Greek shows/movies in the dining area.   And for the lack of traditional Greek restaurants in CLT, the Mad Greek is definitely a top contender.",

If you're in the area I might pop in if craving greek food. But I wouldn't drive way out of my way to do eat there. But don't avoid it, others seem to love it it may just not be in my wheelhouse.",

I got the gyro entree plate, which came with a absolutely delicious green salad. Super crisp lettuce and a fresh dressing that was so tasty! The gyro plate came with gyro meat, French fries, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce. Everything was full of flavor, especially the tzatziki sauce, which was thick and delightfully herb-y. I was too full to eat dessert there, but you have to get a baklava to go, their baklava is amazing, and such a good portion too.

Overall The Mad Greek matches expectations for serving classic Greek food with very Greek themed decorations. The staff is super friendly and the food is really good too. Portions are large so bring a friend or come hungry.   I highly recommend the hummus and pita and anything with gyro meat. Also don't sleep on the Greek coffee - served at 1 million degrees but delicious. They also have a nice covered patio that is great when the weather is warm. If you want to take a quick trip in spirit and taste to the Mediterranean, then the Mad Greek is certainly a good bet!",

Today the service was awful, air conditioning didn't seem to be working and they went from amazing hand cut fries to generic frozen crinkle fries. The Greek half chicken was dry and didn't live up to expectations. I will no longer recommend this restaurant to others. PREVIOUS REVIEW: Hands down best chicken pita in the Charlotte area. I  have driven by many times without even noticing It was there. Today was the first time I've stopped and I will absolutely be back for more. Thank you!!",

The bathroom was something short of clean and the floors were in need of sweeping.  The back corner of the restaurant looked like someone's office because there were papers, files, and a computer in plain site....not in a \"I'm need to have lunch and do some work\" type of way...it was clearly the restaurant's office.

I could tell each ingredient was fresh - the pita hot and soft, the lettuce crispy, the gyro meat tender and full of flavor. And the tzatziki was the best I've had in Charlotte! The fries were also quite good too. A+.  The waitresses were friendly and attentive as well. The star deduction is only because of the restaurant itself. Our table was noticeably dirty, and the decor and lighting left much to be desired. The air also felt really stale and warm.  But these factors won't keep me from visiting again for another one of their delicious gyros. Maybe I'll just get takeout next time.",

    "text": "It's a restaurant that has been around for awhile. I went for lunch with my friend (after leaving another restaurant down the road earlier that never sent a server to our table),  and the service was fine here. Someone greeted us and was pleasant, took our order and came back to check on us. So, I had no problem with service, but the food was just not good, except for the pita bread which was hot and delicious.   The fries were cold when they were brought out, my dish was okay and the baklava was soggy. The tzatziki was good, but there wasn't much of it and they wanted to charge extra for another small condiment container of it. The lettuce in the greek salad was a little limp. The tea was bitter as if it had been sitting out too long. With drinks, a piece of baklava and two lunches, we ended up paying $32 for lunch (without the tip). We both got lunch specials.  I don't really consider that \"cheap\" and it looked as if they had raised their prices a bit since the higher prices were stuck down over the old prices on the menu.   This was nothing special. I probably wouldn't go back.",

I dont' know if I would drive and make a special trip, but if I was in the neighborhood I would eat there again.    In the light of day, it didn't seem so clean to me.  If you are the kind of person that looks at sanitation ratings, it might not be the place for you. I didn't see what their score was and I do not care, I will eat anywhere, but I know what people like when they think of a clean restaurant.  On the upside, our server was pleasant, we ordered chicken sandwiches on pita.  It was served hot and was very filling.  It would be so much better for you to eat at the Mad Greek instead of fast food anyday.",

Burgers, sandwiches, Greek standards and breakfast all day.    The gyro is one of the best I've tried in town because they actually cook it on a spit and shave it off when it gets crispy the way you're supposed to (instead of pan frying up frozen strips).  My gyro and fries came out piping hot.  Will definitely be back to try their Greek chicken and other dishes.  An added bonus, they're open till 3am during the week and 4am on Fridays and Saturdays.",

The first time we ate here, we were the only patrons in the place -  I was definitely worried. The same thing happened the next time. And the time after that.... Apparently, I just pick off-times for the place, because based on the gyro, tzaziki and Greek salad, it would surprise me that the place is dead.   My go-to meal here is a large Greek salad, topped with gyro meat and a side of that heavenly tzaziki sauce. It never fails to be an absolutely satisfying meal.   The waitstaff is friendly and attentive - even after walking in after closing (oops!) our waitress INSISTED that we place an order and sit down to eat.   In talking with another waitress, we learned that The Mad Greek sources its herbs and produce either from the veggie garden on the side of the property or from the local farmers market. They also source their meats from a small meat market in Charlotte.   If you're looking for a corporate, sterile dining experience, this is definitely not it. I can't speak for much of the menue, but I will give The Mad Greek my vote for best gyro in town.",

    "text": "Maybe the best Greek food I've had outside of Greece. We got the grape leaves appetizer, which comes with hot crispy pita, tzatziki, and a pile of super fresh feta drizzled with olive oil. The dolmades were tender and lemony and delicious, and the feta was amazing. That sounds silly; it's just feta, right?? But it was GOOD.  My mom got the appetizer spanakopita (I think it's the same as the entree, it just doesn't came w a salad or pita, which is fine w her) and it was yummy too. The filling was different from other spanakopita I've had; creamier, and with a hint of lemon. Very, very good.  I got the Greek style chicken pita w the Greek fries. A \"Greek style\" pita means it's served w the fries IN the sandwich, just like in Greece. The Greek fries are a little more than just plain fries, but they have feta and oregano. The fries were hand cut and HOT, so they would've been delicious plain, but the feta was nice. The pita was good; the chicken was crispy on the edges and the pita itself was both fluffy and crisp.  We'll be back!! Soon!!",

The portions they brought out to us were shockingly small so we mentioned that to the server...nothing was done. They refused to send out a manager to talk with us and then berated us for complaining.    When we left, some punk 20 something year old who identified himself as an owner followed us (myself and my 2 female friends) to the car badgering us about us being rude to them.  Ironic.   I did not hear this but my friend said that the waitress threatened to slap us.  Given their attitudes and other actions, this claim doesn't surprise me.   I'd recommend that no one goes to this restaurant because of their total disregard for customer service and basic decency.  Owners daughter's a liar. Their father didn't come out to diffuse the situation and I didn't approach her yelling. I told her i was pissed when she cut me off during my sentence of \"I know you're really busy but we've waited for 20 min for you father.\" And her bf is lucky I didn't act on his ridiculous threatening stalking of me while I left. Not a very smart move pal.   And sweetheart, when you rips (you are a liar to say I threw it) someone's card out of their hand and cut them off then you deserve to be told what a scumbag you are.",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite Greek restaurant in Charlotte.  Not anymore. Me and my best friend had hyped this place to my mom. And now I WILL NEVER GO BACK. We started our meal with the calamari. It was lackluster to say the least. There was barely enough calamari to cover the plate. It wasn't fresh. We said something to our waitress and she said well it comes prepackaged and that's the size you get. Well ok then. Then our food came out. My gyro and my mom's kebab plate came out first. My bff waited 20 additional minutes for his Grecian pork. He had to ask the waitress about it and she said it was coming, didn't bother to check with the kitchen. There were barely any fries on the plate. Bff finally got his food and half the ingredients were missing from his pita. We asked to speak to the manager. Then we waited 30 minutes. While we were waiting we heard waitresses refuse to serve food because there wasn't enough food on the plate (does that complaint sound familiar?) The chefs put the wrong food and sauces in bags. The waitresses were the people who saved them from their error. We got tired of waiting so we went to pay. My bff was treating us to dinner and asked they take the calamari off because of the serving size. They refused. That's when the owner of the restaurant finally came out and started yelling at us, the customer. When I say yelling I mean yelling. He said well we ate the food so clearly we enjoyed it. When we told them we ate it because we were hungry and had been waiting 30 minutes he said well then you pay and continued yelling. Our waitress ripped my friend's card out of his hand. She told us she never wanted to see us in her restaurant again and if we did come back she'd smack us. I raised the point that she had refused to serve an undersized portion to another table - it was clearly a problem the kitchen faced across the board. She yelled at me that it was a different order and had nothing to do with our meal. At this point the customers had been yelled at, verbally abused, and belittled for a reasonable complaint that was a consistent problem. What makes things worse is what happened next. A younger gentleman very closely followed my bff to the car and was berating him for complaining. We were leaving and yet we were followed out in an aggressive manner. This man, who said he owned the restaurant, proceeded to insult my elderly and disabled mom. She had said and done nothing during all of this. When he insulted her I lost it and told him to keep her out of this, to go back inside and leave us alone. He then tried to tell me how I should speak to him. We pulled off after telling him we'd never be back.  If you value a restaurant that respects its customers don't eat here. If you like good Greek food with generous portions, don't eat here. If you have friends or family who are elderly and/or disabled, don't eat here. This is the worst dining experience of my life.  I appreciate the waitresses' response however they did not try to resolve anything. We asked to speak to her father and waited, and waited. It was her father who started yelling at us through the window to the kitchen and her boyfriend who followed us out of the restaurant. Then her boyfriend tried to bring my mother - NOT my grandmother - into the situation. I've eaten at this restaurant numerous times - never asked for free food or complained. In fact I'd previously written a five star review. The way that this restaurant handled one relatively minor complaint and escalated it to us being yelled at in front of other diners is ridiculous. Given the situation of course I'm going to write a review so that others don't experience the humiliation I did.",

    "text": "Okay, so I don't know where to start. I was recommended to try this place by my YELP bestie, I love Greek food and I trusted her so why not. I walked into the restaurant and it was apparent that it has not been updated in a very long time but we decided to dine in. I was a bit sketched out to sit, but I decided to go. Working in a restaurant prior, I have a habit of observing every little detail that goes on, so while I'm sitting here I notice that not only the restaurant hasn't been updated, but neither has it been cleaned throughly either.   Moving on, I didn't realize the waitress was even our waitress because she was in gym clothing that was not suitable for the restaurant, more like hooters. She was quick to take our order, but after she decided to sit down right on the countertop - where the coffee gets  brewed and mugs are placed, on her phone. It was very unprofessional. I was just so confused that there was no supervision or management around because there was plenty of cleaning that could've been done.  Anyways, we finally got our food. With all that being said the food looked fresh and it was hot. The presentation of the plate was not the best and alittle sloppy, but the food was the least of the issues. However, our food was actually very good, I was impressed. This was probably on the top of my list of Greek places I tried. I ordered a Greek salad with chicken. Wow, it was so flavorful and it came with a side of pita. The seasoning on it was amazing. I also ordered a side of tzatziki sauce and it tasted amazing! It was thick with chunks of cucumbers. I could've ate a whole jar, I used it as a dressing on my whole salad.   While we were eating, there was an annoying fly bothering ever two minutes. My YELP bestie said the same thing happened to her last time she came in. I know it's hard to keep the flies away, but it was a bit irritating waving my arm trying to swat a fly. A few minutes later someone from the kitchen came out. He touched the remote of the television to change the channel with black gloves on. Standing there for a few minutes, he goes into the men's bathroom still with his gloves on. We were in shock! We were hoping he wouldn't come out with the same gloves on since it was odd. But guess what.. he did. I was completely dumbfounded in disgust. I mean common sense, that's a huge health violation. I lost my appetite.   My heart was broken. Coming from a hospitality and restaurant background these things are important to me. I love exploring exploring restaurants and trying new places with great reviews. So this killed me to see how a great restaurant was being neglected.",

Really what you think of when you think hole in the wall.   The menu has what you would expect from Greek food for the most part. There are many different pita options.   I went with the classic gyro pita and upgraded my fries to Greek fries (fries with lemon, feta, and herbs). I've had better gyros, but it was pretty good. The meat seemed kind of overcooked. I really like the fries.   While it's a sit-down restaurant, they don't bring your check to you. You pay at the counter when you're done.

I ordered the Gyro pita and the food came out pretty quickly.   I really enjoyed the Gyro and the ingredients were well seasoned and very fresh.   One thing that stood out was the tomatoes.  They tasted very fresh and had the fresh from the garden look.     Service was good and they made sure to check on me a few times.  Overall I really enjoyed the food and the service.   Would repeat.",

Everything from service to food was impeccable. Even the red onions and olives in the salad were amazing and I HATE olives and red onions. Our waitress Amanda was helpful and on point with every aspect of our dining experience while being busy with other tables and takeout orders. I wish I lived closer to this restaurant so I can eat here more often. This place is worth the trip! I can't wait to go back",

It is the only place in NC where I was able to get my favorite Greek beer ARIS. They also put major soccer matches on their big screen (I've watched  some UCL, Europa League, Super League Greece and International matches there). Sometimes I'd ask the staff to put a Premiere League match on a Saturday or Sunday morning when I show up to have a coffee( they offer a variety of hot/iced coffees, fredo espresso)  My favorite menu items are: 1. Pork Souvlaki Dinner 2. Meat Trio (when I'm very hungry) 3. Double Cheeseburger (one of the best burgers I've had)  Make sure you grab a piece of fresh homemade baklava on your way out!",

Thanks to my handy friend, Google we were looking for something close by and open early.   We stumbled upon The Mad Greek of Charlotte and all agreed that greek food sounded like a great idea. Pulling up to the restaurant we could tell the restaurant had been around for a while and knew it was going to be VERY authentic Greek food and not a knock off.   My dad has a classic gyro and grape leaves, I ordered a chicken pita and my mom had a Greek salad with the lentil soup. My chicken pita was prepared to perfection as was my dad's gyro. Everything was fresh and tasty. The grape leaves my dad ordered were easily the BEST grape leaves we have both ever had.   My mom unfortunately didn't enjoy her soup and felt like it lacked flavor. There was no seasoning and it was very bland. Despite the flavorless soup, we really enjoyed our experience and I will definitely be going back!",

It very much is as they say \"a hole in the wall\" but for take out I am hard pressed to find a better place in a pinch.  Plus the lack of good Greek food in Charlotte really makes this place stand out as a real winner.  I've only been a few time and both times for takeout but I could tell its a family operation that relies heavily on regulars.  I had the chicken skewers, greek salad, fries, and I even added a baklava for dessert.  Loved the fries!  Greek salad was the best I've ever had and the chicken and pita bread were good too.  I'll definitely be back for midweek takeout here!",

I lived in Greece for many years and I would say that they do offer many  of the small traditional plates but they do Americanize their food to appease our palate.  The staff is somewhat friendly but I would not say they are like the staff at the Estia's Kouzina in Belmont, NC.  The mad Greek is more fast food and the Estia's is more like traditional food.  I had the staple of Greece , the gyro and a side of stuffed grape leaves. The meat slices were mostly dry and crunchy but txatziki sauce was tasty. Overall I would say the gyro was Very poorly presented and disappointing. The dolmadakia were so hot they burned the roof of my mouth and I could not enjoy the rest of my food. I was not warned before hand and although I told the waitress, she ignored the comment.  I am giving the place 3 out of 5 only because I did enjoy the taste of some of the food and they had a good selection to choose from.",

I opted for the sandwich in pita. I thought it was really cool he addressed me and made a recommendation instead of waiting to get my order from a server. THEN THE FOOD CAME. Omg. The salad was out in 30 seconds- plenty of toppings, quality cheese, veggies, and olives, amazing dressing and seasoning! Next my sandwich- The gyro is roasted in house on a spit! Fresh never frozen and it is amazzzing. The tzatziki was obviously fresh and incredible. After a few bites the chef came back out of the kitchen to ask how my food was then (in a heavy Greek accent) told me about the meats they grill in house and about the desserts they make in house! Y'all- as I'm typing this- he just brought me out samples of the grilled chicken and grilled beef! His name is Chris and I just became his #1 fan.  He told me he has been in the states for a long time and said \"that's home\" while pointing to a framed picture of a beautiful Greek town. How cool. My server was very nice and attentive. I'll totally be back!",

We asked for a table outside as we had our dog with us. Our server came out with waters and asked if we were ready to order. We told her we would start with the hummus and pita. She came back and asked if we were ready to order and we asked if she had put the hummus in. No she had not. When the hummus arrived we ordered our entrees. I was out of water by this point. 20 minutes later, still no water. She dropped our entrees and said she would be right back with water. Never came back during the entire meal. My boyfriend did not receive the salad or pita that was supposed to come with his meal so he just had two sticks of meat with fries. Our meals were actually very good, but he would have liked the salad that came with his meal. After we were done eating we sat there a minute and still our server had not come back out since dropping our entrees. I went to the counter and she was standing there with the other server and asked how everything was. I said that my boyfriend had not received half of the items his meal came with and we were never checked on or given water refills. No apology. She then tried to argue with me that his meal didn't come with those things until the other server corrected her. She took $5 off the bill for it but still no apology about poor service or that we never received what we ordered. And there was still one person in the restaurant! The only other people that came in while we were there placed carry out orders, and now I see why. I enjoyed the food, and can understand bad service if you are busy, but this experience is enough to make me never come back.",

I also got the soup of the day which was chicken noodle. Yum yum and yummy! Our entrees were traditional gyros and moussaka. Everything was fantastic. The pita bread is down right addicting. You must try the homemade galaktoboureko(custard pie) and baklava for dessert. Best baklava I've ever had. It it soft and like a pie. I will definitely be back.",

We got the hummus appetizer, Kebob dinner platter (two large pieces of meat, about 8-10oz, fried, pita and a Greek salad), and a Greek salad with chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful! The dressing had a mustardy twang which was new but delicious! I'll definitely be back. Totally worth the drive from Noda.",

    "text": "Dear Mad Greek,  Where have you been during my time in Charlotte?  Why did I pass by you a number of times in my first three years without ever stopping by to bear witness to your gyros?  How did I live so long without experiencing your delicious, greasy gyros, scrumptious Greek salad, and surprisingly decent french fries?  I suppose part of the thing the issue is that your building, while somewhat eye-catching with the white and blue paint, looks pretty small and is located in a slightly run-down area of town.  However, I love the bright colors and simple decor you have going on inside.  Every time I've been, the staff people working have been friendly and helpful too.  Your gyros are definitely where it's at here.  For less than $10, you offer a tasty and good-sized gyro sandwich, with the most amazing tzatziki my mouth has ever tasted, and a generous portion of seasoned french fries.  I love that for a couple of dollars more you can upgrade to a gyro dinner, which has enough meat for two gyros, plus a Greek side salad and fries.  Your Greek salad has plenty of great things, with lots of feta cheese, Greek peppers, delicious Greek dressing, and Kalamata olives (which are not pitted, but still good).  I am sad I never stopped sooner.  But now that I've found you, I won't ever let you go.  I love your cheap prices, delicious food, and convenient location to my work.  Sincerely, Ana O.",

Having been to Greece just last summer, we went with high hopes of authentic fare, but it was all pretty hit or miss.

Our waitress was very efficient and simultaneously made sure that everything we asked for worked out! I asked for lemon in my water and swapped out fries for grape leaves. The pita was served warm both when it was a starter with tzatziki and as a side to my boyfriend's meal. His side Greek salad was gigantic and had a really nice variety and quantity of vegetables, cheese and dressing. His french fries were also served hot! I had the gyro and he had the gyro platter (just the gyro meat on a plate) and the portions for that were very generous as well. My gyro wrap had meat in it down to the last bite which doesn't always happen.   The ambiance is very much that of a Greek diner. There were basic tables, booths and a counter to sit at. The whole place felt clean and fairly bright and there were large pictures/murals of Greek vistas on the wall. There was even chatter in the background in what may have been Greek. We paid at the counter and left feeling very satisfied with the experience.",

Waitress quickly came to hand us some menus. A quick glanced over the menu and I spotted a few of my favorite Greek food treats. I ordered the grape leaves platter which came with 6 nicely stuffed grape leaves along with a greek salad, a very creamy tzatziki, and warm pita (flat bread). The grape leaves were served hot. The creamy rice stuffing had a  perfect balanced of lemon, seasonings and olive oil.  Not too tangy as I've sometimes had at other places.  The tzatziki was thick and garlicky in the best way possible. The side Greek salad was impressive, tossed in a perfect dressing and topped with a generous amount of feta cheese that was smooth and mild in flavor.  My hubby had the gyro plate and thoroughly enjoyed it (he grew up in a Greek neighborhood in Chicago. He knows good Gyro).  We took some baklava to go and it was heavenly!  It's safe to say I'll be coming back for more.",

Our waiter was very friendly and told us what the chef was currently working on so we knew what was the freshest. We started with the grape leaves appetizer which might be some of the best stuffed grape leaves I've had anywhere. They were fresh and warm, served on a plate doused with olive oil with hot fresh soft pita, tzatziki crumbled feta, tomatoes, and an olive. Easily the most flavorful tzatziki I've ever had. We ordered a classic chicken pita and a gyro pita which were both absolutely amazing. I got rice on the side instead of french fries and the rice was also extremely flavorful. In fact, every part of the meal was incredibly fresh and flavorful. We went back for a second time less than a week later for a pickup order and everything was just as fresh and delicious as the first time and the prices are very reasonable. This is my new favorite restaurant in south Charlotte. I plan to frequent this place all the time.",

The waitress/hostess rushed us to order, only recommended the salad as being a great option if I want to eat healthy,(mind you I'm plus size) once I placed my order, I was scoffed at and ignored. The only way we were acknowledged was when we requested service and it was time to pay for our meal. Overall the service was unacceptable and has forced us to never dine here again.

The owner was telling us about the different meats that they offer.  We both ordered the Gyro dinner and it was so tasty!  The Greek salad with the homemade dressing was delicious, the french fries were nice and crispy and the gyro meat was so flavorful.  We ordered extra taziki sauce and it's a good thing because the homemade sauce was the best I've ever had!!  We will definitely go back!!",

I took a little bite of the one that I got to go, and nearly lost my mind. It should really be a crime to make something that good! I have def found a new local favorite spot in CLT.

I literally felt that I was dropped into the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Sat next to a couple who proceeded to explain to us why we are still Greek, even though we are Irish and Italian and then (after verifying multiple times that we were married) kept telling us how we need to have babies! Awesome experience. Most of the people in here were Greek.  Sat outside...it was nice and shaded and got to play a game of checkers. We ordered the pita and hummus and the lamb kabobs on special. The hummus was simple, yet, perfect. The lamb was so tender it literally melted in your mouth. It came with a large greek salad and some fries. Everything we had was just so delicious and authentic. The couple beside us convinced us to get this cake, which I couldn't pronounce. It was absolutely amazing.   Awesome place that we will definitely return to when the Greek food craving hits again!",

The place is located on South Blvd, and it would be easy to just drive right by it! In fact, I have multiple times! But it's totally worth a visit.   I was greeted when I walked in and since I was visiting solo I requested my order to go. I'd checked out the menu online but based on what they had told me I knew I had to try the one of the Gyro dinners. I decided to go with the Gryo Plate which comes with the gyro meat, pita bread, greek salad and french fries!  Yep, all of that comes with your meal.  I opted for more salad and no fries and was more than impressed with the size of my food. My goodness! The salad was so fresh and full of toppings and the feta was AMAZING. The gyro meat was so perfectly seasoned, juicy and so tender...to say I enjoyed it would be an understatement. It was fantastic.   I think I've found a new favorite Greek spot that's actually on my side of town. Can you say #winning? If you're looking for good, authentic Greek food that's quick and super reasonably priced...this is your place!    I can't wait for my next visit.",

I had the Pork Souvlaki and fries both of the two times I'm reviewing and it was fatty and gristly both times, and had a questionable taste to it that I've never experienced before eating there.  The French fries are normally delicious but they were half cooked, greasy and floppy.  The service was terrible and patrons including me had to get up and go ask for ketchup and drink refills.
