And the food was absolutely delicious!  Will definitely go back!  Highly recommend this restaurant for the ambience, cuisine, and service.",

But this day was neither busy or late night. Our server was absolutely horrible. We sat for 10 minutes before even being greeted and when we placed our drink order went another 10 minutes before they even hit the table. A glass of wine, a beer and a water with lemon that was delivered without any lemon. Our server then came back to take our order. We ordered a ribeye, the salmon and chicken tostadas (or whatever they're called) with no crema. We waited for about 20 minutes and finally received our order. WRONG, and delivered to the table behind us. I had to ask if they were they're before they passed them over to us and they had crema. So we sent it back to be remade and after a while they sent us the order back and it was awful. We told the server is was bad and she said she was enjoying the one we sent back and thought it was pretty good. We asked for our check and left. Our servers name was Dana, I believe. She only had two, maybe three tables and the service was beyond slow and is the main reason I won't be back. I brought my friends here earlier in the week and ended up having our entire bill taken care of because the service was so bad. Won't be back.",

    "text": "Rock Bottom has been a graduation tradition for my family for the third year in a row this year. I'm not sure what has happened over the course of this time frame but I'm not sure I've ever been so dissatisfied with service somewhere in my life! To start off, we arrived around 9:30 or so, the hostess proceeded to POINT our party of 6 to a dirty table. One of the employees cleaned it off for us and apologized. We sat down, and for 20 minutes we patiently waited on a server to take our drink order. Nothing. Finally, we asked the bartender for drinks as the table of two behind us left in frustration for the same reason. I suppose message was relayed to our server as we finally got someone to come and take our order. She apologized and said their was a mix up with her coworker. She was a sweet girl and I felt bad for her but at the same time we were one of maybe two or three other tables. Needless to say, when our food arrived 45 minutes later it was cold. After our food arrived our waitress told us they were folding silverware in the back and they didn't have any rolled. So we waited again. We didn't leave until after closing (11pm). By the time we finally left the place was still a wreck. It looked like no one had been bussing for hours, the tables around us were disgusting. I can kindly say we will not be returning. Rock Bottom has officially hit rock bottom.",

Everyone was helpful and friendly; we didn't even mind the 20 minute wait (at  5:30 PM?). Did not care for their IPA. I love beer and only drank maybe half - tasted more like a Lager to me. Wife's soup was barely warm but she said the flavor was good. My Santa Fe Ranch Chicken Salad was just okay. Some of the lettuce was a bit limp and slimy. I did like the deep fried Jalapeno rings on top. Our waiter was really good but smelled heavily of cigarettes.  Our glasses never went empty and he even packed up our leftovers and bagged them. I think trying to run a good brewery and restaurant at the same time is a tricky operation. Sometimes one may suffer to highlight the other, or both may be slightly diminished as the operational  focus is spread thin. A-OK but not great. Go at least once and decide for yourself.",

We were able to get a table right away.......   And lucky for us....... everyone of us LOVED our dish. I had the Fish and Chips which were made from fresh Haddock perfectly battered and fried.  It was served with an excellent Apple Slaw that awakened the senses in my mouth.   The Commissioner loved his drink and my glass of wine was hearty and full bodied.  His dinner was an excellent adult version of Mac and Cheese with Bacon and Chicken.  As we were leaving the place was starting to get busier and busier. So stop in if you are in the neighborhood.

    "text": "Came here the other night with my guy after going out on a long planned date night to the hornets spurs game. Originally after the game we had planned on going to our old faithful Thomas street tavern, but we were to tired to continue drinking and just wanted food and bed. Most things were closing up that I suggested along the way until we came upon Rock Bottom. I had never been there and neither had he so we were excited to try something new.   To be honest the whole experience started out wrong so I probably should have gone with my instincts and left right away. We sat ourselves in the bar area we could tell that was the only section open and well no one had come to seat us so sat we did. the server whos name ill keep out of this just because I believe people have bad days and sometimes you cant hide it even at work it happens to the best of us. however she was extremely short and the general impression we received was that she would rather not only be doing anything but serving us but that she genuinely didn't like us for whatever reason. She started by asking if we had been there before we said no she went over the fact that they were a brewery and what would we like to drink. We sampled one of their house beers that was on special that night. I said it was ok and that I would rather have a mixed drink. My guy asked if they had OMB copper on tap, she retorted \"no were a brewery we don't have other peoples beer here!\" ..... uh ok well then why is miller lite and Newcastle on tap right behind you I ask.. she said well we have a few I guess.... ok...... we then went over the menu and my guy ordered a ribeye well done (much to my dismay and whining about why he was ruining a perfectly good steak... I'm working on him)  I ordered the salmon.   About 5 minutes later our server returns to inform me that they had not necessarily run out of salmon but that at that point in the night they had already put it away (they didn't close for another hour or more) and that she would just get me a menu.. so I ordered a salad that sounded really good it was a smoky tomato and kale salad that I added shrimp to. when the food came out the steak was med rare (me happy my guy not so much) and my salad was a little bowl of lettuce kale and pico de gallo with some sort or spicy aioli for dressing that was really just mostly mayo. yuck. I was starving so at this point I just made do.  my guy asked the server once she came back to please put the steak back on the grill for a little longer since it was not well done. she just grabbed the plate and walked off then brought back his broccoli to eat without his steak so that \"he had something to eat while he waited\" she came back about 1 min and a half later with a steak that looked like had been gotten out of the dumpster, I mean it wasn't it was his but it had been microwaved into next year. This is not hard to tell folks and for my guy it was just an insult he cooks for a living and I served for 11 years its pretty much a huge screw you mr customer I could care less about your experience here with us.  He asked for more sauce since they microwaved it she brought it didn't say anything didn't ask how it turned out then once we asked for the check before she brought it she asked how everything was I said OK to be nice but try to get the point across she looked down at the plate she picked up rolled her eyes and walked off without another word.  A few minutes later brought the check for 50 bucks on food I would have been so much better off not eating.   I know this was a long review but to end all I can say is when walking uptown and thinking about places to eat for dinner, pass this place up and try one of the other wonderful places uptown like ruths chris or capital grill.  I really wish I had just gone with Thomas street and next time given limited options well just be ordering pizza or hitting a drive through or just not eating. Everything about this place turned me off which is a shame I hate unhappy reviews.",

We ordered the chorizo and cotija pretzel bites as an app and they were delicious, we had just wishes there were more of them! It came with six small pretzel bites and a jalapeno mustard dipping sauce - so good! I ordered the RB Ale Chicken. It was delicious. It came with cheddar and green chili mashed potatoes (amazing) and veggies (equally as amazing). My boyfriend ordered the chicken fried chicken (also delicious). He subbed the apple coleslaw for the mac and cheese. The ma and cheese tasted so much better than it looked. I always expect mac and cheese to look creamy and cheesy, but this looked almost dry when it came out. But, when we tasted it, we were totally wrong for judging it by its looks. It tasted rich and cheesy and was topped with parmesan breadcrumbs.   Our entrees took a little longer than expected to come out, but we didn't even notice since we were having such a great time. The bartender who was serving us noticed this, and gave us a free dessert without us complaining or asking which we were very grateful for! We got the brownie sundae but ordered a half order of it since the whole thing normally comes with four brownies. Half of the portion was still too much! But it was amazing! Will definitely be back :)",

Overall the tacos tasted like something from Taco Bell and the sides were all I could salvage of the meal. Friend had a chicken sandwich that was clearly re-heated chicken, stale bun, one slice of avocado and soggy fries.   Apparently people love this place. I'd come back to have a beer and an appetizer but probably stay away from the rest of the menu. Over priced and overrated!",

While I haven't had a bad dish or poor service, Rock Bottom seems to be a variation on a theme: a classy Americana pub with dressed up pub fare and dark paneling.

I've had a pretty awesome quesadilla and enchiladas to the tune of $12-14 and a hearty pick-your-own toppings cheeseburger.  I love carbs, so in this aspect, Rock Bottom does not dissapoint.  The chicken fingers are so-so.  However, the fries evoke memories of your middle school cafeteria (thin cut and taste like veggie oil).  The staff are very friendly and professional; they actually make sure you're doing OK unlike wait staff at most sports bars.  I've never been treated rudely or indifferently here-I would vouch for the service any day.  What then, is the \"selling point\" of Rock Bottom.  Duh, location!  The outdoor seating gives view to a long stretch of Tryon St.  Rock Bottom is an awesome place to people-watch or grab a reasonable meal before launching an evening Uptown.  Rock Bottom is casual but not trashy, a pub that resorts to being a sports bar, and a stopping point but not a destination. If you've exhausted your rotation of Uptown restaurants and hangouts, at least add Rock Bottom to your list.",

We arrived shortly after they opened and were the only customers I believe for the first few minutes. I've eaten at Rock Bottoms in different cities and enjoyed my experiences with them each time. I would recommended this location. As an extra bonus they validated our parking which is always a bonus!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were part of a friend's birthday party of about 12 adults on a Thursday night. It was not especially crowded (no wait) and we had reservations. 1. Nobody took our drink orders or brought us water for over 20minutes. 2. When they brought out all the appetizers, ours was not among them, because it was never put in. When it finally came out, it was clear the nachos were rushed and they were not especially good. 3. When the entree came out, we were brought the incorrect dish, at this point I had more than enough of the place, so I told them to forget about it and bring the check. 4. Everyone had finished their meals for nearly an hour before the checks were sporadically brought out. After all the checks were brought out, we had to pull the waitress aside and specifically ask for her to bring ours. 5. During this whole time, there was no one who looked like a manager to be found. Everyone at the table was clearly upset by the service, yet management never showed its face.  This was, by far, the worst dining experience I have ever been a part of and I would not recommend this overrated establishment to anyone.",

We were told we would wait for 20 minutes which seemed ridiculous as there were open tables all over the restaurant and bar and finally got seated in one of these open tables after 40 minutes of waiting. The $10 calamari was a very small portion, the sauces were obviously not made in-house, and the pieces of calamari were TINY! We both ordered mediocre salads and didn't find their brews to be anything special. Would have rather spent $50 elsewhere.",

But this last time I went I was really impressed by the professionalism of the management. I just read the review by Erick V and I was there when the party from the ACN convention was at rock bottom, and they were out of control and ruining my dining experience. I was sitting next to the bar and twice I saw people from the ACN party steal my drink from the bar well. Andrea was quick to come over and very calmly take care of the problem, despite the fact she had to handle 100+ party out of control at the same time. And I was happy to see that she called the police because the party was literally stealing my drinks. And after reading the review from the ACN party I have to say when you go out to eat you shouldn't need a host or manager to tell you to pay your tab, you pay it on your own like a normal adult, and don't steal people's drinks.",

You can go there one night and have great food and service, whereas you could go there on a totally different night and experience the complete opposite.  The same goes for the food.  Some dishes are awesome (shrimp and grits, stuffed chicken) while others I would definitely shy away from (pizza).  If you are a beer lover, they have some good brews which are actually crafted on site.  The beer can be better than the food more times than not and I would recommend people to go here for that more than the food.  The Southern Flyer is great for pale ale folks like myself.  If you give this place a shot, prepare to roll the dice because you don't know who you will get, or what the food will be like when it comes out.  The one thing you will be guaranteed to have if you are so inclined is a nice brew made on-site.  Can't beat that sometimes...",

Unfortunately that burger was \"86'd\"... as was her second choice. We weren't told that until 10 to 15 minutes after ordering, which delayed our dinner. Otherwise what we got was OK. We went for a second time with some friends to watch a Panthers game, and, again, it was just OK. i tried a third time and not only did our food take a long time, but it was clear that mine was made first and had just been sitting out because nothing was warm. Three strikes and you're out in my book. I will not be going back. If you do go, I recommend going when it isn't busy (as it was with my first and third experience).",

The menu was pretty extensive but we'd viewed it online beforehand and knew what we wanted. Hubs got the seafood cobb salad which was HUGE and he enjoyed every last bit of it. I ordered the hazelnut crusted chicken primarily because I noticed before we went that a few reviewers here on yelp recommended it. It was reallllllly good! Also HUGE portions that hubs had to help me eat. the chicken itself was really tender and juicy and that crust and sauce are delicious. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, as you'd expect, and even the vegetables were yummy. We also had the jalapeno spinach dip which was not that great. I mean it was fine, but out of all the spinach dips I've tried in my life, it was not on the top 10. The atmosphere is nice, it's pleasantly decorated and clean, nothing special. Seems pretty large, probably good for groups. The booth we sat in was really spacious and comfortable. Our service was quick and adequate, although our specific server seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else but work that night. She wasn't rude, just did the bare minimum and spoke very quiet and without any energy. But she was quick and got our orders right, which is really what matters. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if the location and timing was just right, as it was for us last night, I would go again.",

The positives about Rock Bottom... The restaurant it's self is a really cool space and it's very clean. There are a ton of great beers on tap. The place is very large and we were able to get seated right away on a Friday night. Some of the food was good.   I dined with a party of six and we ordered a variety of foods... The burgers were just okay. Not particularly flavorful but edible. The onion rings were good. The nacho appetizer was good and the salsa it was served with was very good.  The pretzel sick appetizer was odd... The sticks were not actually pretzels. The didn't look or taste like pretzels, rather like breadsticks. The cheesy jalapeno dip it was served with was good. The firecracker shrimp was very good, definitely the highlight of the meal. The chicken tacos were good. I personally ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos and they were served cold. Not room temperature or lukewarm. They were cold, like they had literally just been pulled from the walk-in.Had they been warm, they probably would have been good. They were served with a side of bland, instant rice and black beans.  The biggest negative about Rock Bottom is by far the service. The service was awful. Although we were seated right away, the server was slow to take our drink order... And slow to return with the drinks... and slow to take our appetizer order... and slow to take our dinner order... And never stopped by to see if everything was okay with our food.  The appetizers came to our table all at once and quickly enough, so there were no issues there.  It then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving. Between the six of us, four people had ordered burgers. One burger was brought to the table and then *nothing* else was brought out for 15 minutes... Three more entrees (burgers) were served. And then 5 minutes later, a fifth entree was brought out. And 10 minutes after that (30 minutes after the first entree was brought out) the last entree was delivered (the cold lobster and shrimp tacos). Amidst all of this, I noticed the server did have time to engage in some very public displays of affection (e.g., hugging and kissing) with another server in the middle of the restaurant. Although I did not send the tacos back or complain about them to the server (because who knows how long it would have taken to get a hot order brought out), I noticed on the bill that they had been comped. This tells me that they knew they were serving a bad plate of food and sending out too late. Very odd.   I definitely will not return to Rock Bottom and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

It was suppose to be a memorable lunch but it ended up with horrible service. We waited 20 minutes before our server even came to our table. Once he did, he had no idea of the menu and seemed like his first rodeo. We waited for our food for another 20 minutes. My coworker had asked for a beer refill and it actually took 15 minutes to get there. Mind you while we were waiting for service there was nobody (customers) at this time. Very disappointed as the food tasted great.",

I can't speak for the food, but the service and environment leave much to be desired! Sorry Rock Bottom, but you're probably never going to get a second chance. Boooooo.

The spice adds flavor but isn't overwhelming to the palate. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte!",

The service was horrible, from taking drink orders, appetizers,and entrees it was slow, nonchalant, and I guess they figure with or without this table we making money",

We ordered our drinks and after a few minutes my kids sodas and waters were delivered. But then we preceded to wait over 20 minutes longer for our beers ( at a brewery ) even after my husband went to find out what was going on ( and saw our beers sitting at the bar unattended) - it still took another 5 minutes . Our server apologized - but when i said , yeah, it was a little long - he went into a long \" I'm the only one out here - doing what I can do\". There was only one other table sitting outside .  We finally ordered - specified no mayo on the one sandwich - and even said \" more importantly - no mayo \" and no cheese on the burger - just lettuce and bacon. Well. our food came and guess what ?   We ate the food as our server was no where to be found . It was mediocre food at best .  When the server came by , he asked if we would we like our check because he knows we are in a hurry ??! We never said we were and we had been there for well more than an hour and a half .  Just rude and terrible way to service your paying customers .  And if you are wondering , I have worked in the restaurant/service  business so I do know what it's like and appreciate good service.  I can't imagine what would have happened if it was crowded- the place was empty and could not get it together .  Sadly , my tip reflected our poor experience ( and normally a very good tipper ) . There are far many other places in CLT we should have gone and spent our $$.",

I have been here before and never had a problem when im sitting at bar but this particular night our waiter asked if we wanted to sit at bar or in dining room and we chose the latter. He rolled his eyes at us and proceeded to huff and puff as he took us to our table and we didn't know why! He didn't speak at all just mumbles the whole time when we were ordering. It felt like we were inconveniencing him! Never gave us refills, practically threw our foods in front of us. It was very uneasy my boyfriend and i just stayed quiet and tried to not let the attitude get to us but it really did sour the mood. I ordered the bacon cheese burger and jt was barely cooked i asked for well done and it was raw. Such a shame because we usually enjoy it here. Sade to say will not be returning.",

A half our later our server comes back and regrets to inform us we will still have to pay for our food which we now in to-go boxes and delivered an hour and a half after our second appetizer. Our server apologized and offered to pay for our drinks out of her pocket. We were told our entree would not be taken off our check because the manager denied it took an hour and a half for the food to be delivered to our table. In all we paid for everything that we didn't get to eat hot but after the concert that we almost missed due to not being able to get a check from the server.  All said and done, the server was in great spirits and nice.  But was overall the worst experience I've had in a restaurant.",

If you want a \"light\" meal, they have an abundance of salads to choose from.  I'm working my way through each of them, but I haven't had a disappointing one yet and they're each very filling.  If I'm a little hungrier or craving a hot meal, I tend to go with the Blue Crab Stuffed Chicken or the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken.  Mmm... they're both melt-in-your-mouth good.  Then I usually wash them down with whatever brewed-on-the-spot beer they have on special, preferably something light.    Rock Bottom is a good place to take eaters that don't like to experiment with gourmet food (but you can still find something gourmetish yourself!), out-of-town guests, or even a date for a nice, casual get-to-know-you meal in nice surroundings without any pretension.  It can even serve as a great standby if everything else Uptown is too crowded or you can't decide where to eat.  You'll never be disappointed.",

It's spacious, too, so it's a great place to start the night off with a big group of friends. It's a decent place to bring kids as well...the menu is pretty diverse in terms of bar food, so it's good for families.   My favorite part of this spot is the outdoor seating. You don't get a much better outdoor seating experience...you're right in the heart of uptown at one of the busiest intersections. It's fun to sit out there alone and just observe what happens.   It's also a great venue for events. I attended a work-related party here, and the service was great. We all had a good time.",

It's not as cozy as Ri Ra down the street, but that depends on what you are looking for. Service was average so won't identify the server.

The manager was walking around checking in on tables so I asked him for his suggestion from the menu. He suggested the Chicken Parmesan pasta with the \"Smoky Mountain\" pasta sauce and a side of marinara.  It. was. amazing. Perfect recommendation. Had a great time. We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Let me just say, the5 times that I have been here, I have LOVED it!  Went here for the first time with my boyfriend. We went during the week, and they had some kind of trivia going on(it was pretty fun & entertaining) For an appetizer, my boyfriend ordered a caesar salad, which was really good! I ordered chicken quesadillas which were MIND BLOWING!! I mean OMG, they were soooooo good! I had never eaten sour cream or avocado before that night, and now I eat it all the time when I get the quesadillas.  Next, my boyfriend ordered a burger(with cheese, ketcup and mustard. PLAIN I know.) He ordered steak fries that came out more like potato wedges. He thought his burger was so-so. I tasted it, and it was dry and overcooked. The wedges were salty as well.   I ordered a steak(medium well) and fries. Now that was 10 times better than my boyfriends plain burger. My steak was juicy, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection. I couldn't have asked for a better steak! So kudos to the cook! My fries were normal fries which were just as tasty(once again better than my boyfriends) lol.  I have been back to Rock Bottom 4 times since then, and now that I live up the street from it, I plan on becoming a weekly regular! I always get the chicken quesadillas, and have even tried the chicken nachos. Let me tell you that the nachos coming in a heap PILED up on a plate, with cheese, olives, tomatoes, and other stuff. They were sooooo good! Me and my friends couldn't eat it all.  Also, my boyfriend ordered the ribs before, and he did not like them WHAT-SO-EVER. But then again, he was comparing them to the ribs at Firebirds so yea. He also ordered the cheese pizza, and I must say that I have gotten better pizza at chuckie-cheese. I don't know if my boyfriend just has a string of bad luck at ordering at Rock Bottom, but his food is NEVER as good as mines. I have ordered the burger before(cheese, ketchup, mustard, lettuce, bbq sauce, medium well) and it was DELISH!  I recommend Rock Bottom to everyone to try out for themselves!",

Everything I had was bland with the culinary prowess of a microwave burrito.   Crab and artichoke dip was runny, like hot yogurt with the same about of flavor as crab meat (...so, not much).   I got the margarita pizza which was edible but that's the only redeeming quality I can give it. I was with a group of a dozen or so and everyone's summary of their food seemed to be \"meh\".  Basically, if you like Applebee's... you should come to this place and pay more for the same food.",

It gets pretty busy at lunch time so try to arrive a little before noon or around 12:45pm in order to beat the lunch crowd rush. I've not had a problem getting a seat for dinner. And I've always had great service.   The menu is huge (literally) with tons to choose from in terms of beverages and food. The fish tacos are good and the chicken picatta was okay but I found myself scraping off the extra sauce, and the green beans that came with it were overdone and soggy. I did enjoy the french fries.   Where Rock Bottom falls slightly short is the prices. They're frankly too high for this type of establishment (in my mind it's similar to Applebee's or Outback). And as always, parking is a little tough uptown. Ultimately, if you're looking for somewhere to go and the other uptown restaurants are packed, Rock Bottom is a solid choice. Just don't expect to be overwhelmed.",

Rock Bottom offered a great variety that he was pleased with and the brewery atmosphere is really cool.  The spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits (with some fun cocktail options).  The menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone.  Our server was extremely sweet, quick, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings.  The food was surprisingly good.  We tried the southwest eggrolls to start (holy carbs and cheese) and then split a salad with flat bread pizza.  Once we finished dinner we moved to the bar...which I made a note on to visit for game days.  Spectacular set up with plenty of seating.    The gem of this place is actually the bartenders.  I'm sure that it's no surprise that if one sits at a bar, they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders.  These girls were hilarious and carried on great conversation with us without seeming imposing - which is the key to a great bartender.  We were enjoying the atmosphere so much we moved our evening plans to Rock Bottom and had friends meet us there.    Good food, great service, great drinks...we will definitely be back.",

We sat down, not too many clients in the restaurant and service started out well with our server Imani. However, it became evident that either we were placed in a section different from the areas she was working as we kept seeing her less and less or I can just ignore my guest because I think I'm cute and smile and everything will be okay. At the end of our meal, which was very good, she offered us dessert, we opted for another beer which never came. We would catch a glance here and there of her for the next 20 minutes and finally she came over and asked if I beer made it to us. Did you bring me my drink? Then no, I have not gotten my beer. She would look for it right away, but I asked her to just close us out as it just wasn't nice to be there any longer, no excuse, no apology, just said okay, smiling away and walked away to what I hoped would be a quick return with my bill. She again left for another 10 minutes. When she returned I asked her what exactly happened that our drinks never made it to us? Was someone else supposed to bring it, did she forget? She said that someone else usually brings it, she was helping out the bar by bringing our drinks, someone must have taken it, oh my god, i'll just smile at these guys and everything will be fine.... no.... i just want good service. The server who was on our side was taking care of all his clients, bringing them drinks so im pretty sure I was getting the run around. I asked her who the manager was and she said Michael and again walked away. Pretty disrespectful attitude to have in a customer service environment. Next time I come to Charlotte I need to stick to the many many other places with great food and folks that want to take care of their clients. My opinion is that the food here was darn good and consistent, the beer is excellent, the service which is the most important, was \"rock bottom\".",

My wife had the chicken pesto pasta. While that was decent, it wasn't exciting either.  Sure, the plates were \"sizeable.\" But PRICEY for what you get. I mean, we could have gone to Aria Italian nearby and gotten a MUCH better quality of food for LESS than this place! I mean, we went here thinking we would get a good value.

I was meeting a friend for a semi-business lunch, so I wasn't able to try any of their house brewed beers (they server Kaliber, but they don't have their own non-alcoholic beer). The back of their lunch menu is all booze - 11 different martinis and 4 different margaritas and a whole bunch more. Definitely a full bar here!  I had read over the previous Yelpers before going, so I had one of their salads - the Goat Cheese and Hummus. It was a huge scoop of hummus (at least a cup, maybe more) with a dressing tossed salad on top of sliced flatbreads. Way too much food, the hummus was sharp and tasty with just enough garlic that it was delicious but not so much that I was worried about my breath heading back to the office. Maybe there could have been more goat cheese, but that's just me complaining because it was good!  My friend had some sort of cheese topped grilled chicken with fries. While it was good, I absolutely won the competition. ;-)  A very pleasant experience. I'd have no problem going back here if I'm Uptown.",

We then sat at least 15 minutes before we were greater and our drink order was taken, but the drinks took almost 25 minutes before arriving.  When our drinks did arrive, the server ran off before taking our dinner order, more time passes... we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably ~15-20 minutes.  When the food did come out three orders were missing completely, our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found, we sat waiting until finally she came by.  At this point we've been here well over an hour.  The manager comes by, gets the food out, says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table.  I didn't receive the drink promised by the manager and when I asked the server I got a look, this was the first and only time I asked her about anything!?  She brought the drink as I was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues, we explained that we had other commitments that it wasn't necessary.  Then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne, at this point, I'm pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face.    In the end, the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown Charlotte I would chose another place next time.",

Gross.  Bartenders were terrible and not attentive.  Waited 10 minutes before someone asked if we needed something. Unacceptable. The beer was decent, but once we finished we waited a while with empty glasses before finally having to ask for another. Do the bartenders here not work on tips?  Because that's how you get stiffed. Only plus is the beer was $3 and they validate parking.",

I asked if the southwest egg rolls were very spicy before I ordered, she said no and low and behold I get them and they are spicy.  The drink (margarita) was very strong and not sweet enough. Overall they get a D for food and an A for ambience and location.",

In town for the week and we decide to have a Holiday night our at Rock Bottom.  Bosses wife sets it up from 6-8 with open tap, appetizers and some other goodies.  Now long story short we get there at 5:45 and it appears there was a mix-up and they had us down from 4-6 (what office does anything at 4 on a Thursday).  They hold our area for an hour, till 5 before the call to see where we are, of course its after 5 so the phone is off.  They don't call the second number, just give away our area.  So again, long story short we show up at 5:45, all 14 of us and we don't have a table.  Manager on duty cops a serious attitude with our boss and it all goes down hill.  We finally get seated and the service is AWEFUL!.  They bring out apps after about 30 minutes but then take them away because they are for the people at the table we were supposed to be at (serious no-no in the biz).  When food does come out it's COLD.  Felt really bad for the two servers although I do think they got tipped well.  As for the management and the kitchen that part was about as bad as you can get.  Beer was half ass and not worth the trip.  Would not return, no way!  KT",

I have to agree with another review that states, \"Rock bottom\" is how you're left feeling, so the name is appropriate. I ordered the flight and was very pleased with all samples. The pretzel duo was just okay. Cheese dips were clumpy with cold spots so microwaved it was! My entree, veggie Mac and cheese was horrible! No veggies except 3 hard mushroom slices and the pasta was chewy. Just gross! Our waitress if that's what you want to call her was basically nonexistent and did not seem to care that my entree had been sitting on end of table for 30 minutes. She offered to bring ticket without checking why my entree was untouched. I let her know it was not done and I wanted it removed. She simply said okay. Wow! Great customer service! I do not recommend restaurants that I feel are a risk so do not take a chance on dining here! The beer is awesome so bar service only may be an okay! I ordered a growler of Blue Ridge Mist to go and of course, the waitress forgot to place the order so I had to wait on this a little longer! The brewery will suffer unless wait staff improve and chef needs to improve also!",

Our server was not attentive to us or ensuring we had what we needed, but was focused on flirting, lingering, and laying all over a few male customers to which she was not assigned because they appeared to be dressed as though they were wealthy. The food was bland and tasteless; the macaroni was not full cooked and was not even at an al dente texture, which would have been acceptable. We ordered a growler to go- which the waitress failed to put in because she was so focused on returning to entertain those male customers which caused us to have to order the growler again and wait for it and the second check to be generated, in between her flirtation time that is. Sadly disappointed in this location seeing as how it is the oldest brewery in Charlotte it would have been a nice location to return to.",

We ordered drinks and apps but as we ordered apps our waitress walked away without letting us finish our order. When she came back we finished getting the order in. Jalapeno poppers, some shrimp thingy and pretzels. The apps all looked like they came from a frozen box of TGIF from the Harris teeter frozen section. The pretzels came with a cheese dip that was congealed and hard to dip. I took a bight with the cheese and gagged. DISGUSTING.. Keep in mind as well, during this time it took forever to get drinks, silverware etc.  Food we ordered finally came and was all gross. Hamburgers did not seem fresh. Looked like frozen patties. Bacon on burger was not well cooked etc. etc.   Fast forward to today.... I've been in the bathroom all day. No exaggeration, no joke... I haven't left the bathroom at work. SICK TO MY STOMACH...

Waited another 10ish to get said drinks- only to find out that one of the mixed drinks was completely wrong. We didn't even bother telling the waiter because by the time he came back around for us to tell him this- so much time had passed it wasn't even worth it because we knew it'd take another 15 mins to fix it. Parts of our order (soups) were missing but we were charged (waiter never even noticed) and again, we didn't tell him because he didn't visit our table frequently enough for us to notify him.

Saw Rock Bottom didn't have great reviews, but decided to try it anyway as their menu looked great.   1st disappointment - As soon as we walked in, we were informed that they were only serving from their 'late night' very abbreviated menu that started at 8pm. Since we were hungry and didn't have a plan 'B' location, we got seated.  2nd disappointment - We didn't get exactly what we ordered. We ordered the chicken nachos with an additional item of guacamole. When nachos came out...no guacamole!  Never saw waitress again until nachos were gone. I told her that our nachos didn't have the guacamole we ordered and she blamed the kitchen 'for having a bad night'! 3rd disappointment - We got the bill and noticed that the beers were charged more than the menu price and the nachos were charged extra for the chicken.  In the menu under nachos, it says choose chicken, beef, or guacamole for $5. Next line reads Add additional items for $1. Our waitress explained that it may be confusing, but the chicken, beef, or guacamole is EXTRA?!?!?  WHAT?!?!?!?!?!? So I guess all the poor yelp reviews are True with this one!  It was a terrible experience and our first impression of Charlotte was not good.",

They chicken was so juicy and cooked perfectly, with pineapple sauce on top and rice pilaf underneath. I am craving it again as I type this. It is also very cool to walk into a place and order your beer by saying \"red, ale, amber, port\" etc. I will definitely be back.",

One bartender was sort of unfriendly and the other was pleasant and made conversation with us. The appetizers left a lot to be desired. I'm wondering about the jalapeno dip would be eager to drink than dip. It was extremely liquid-like in consistency. Not really a dip. The southwest eggrolls were pretty decent. The wings were average, but cooked perfectly. Overall, it was ok. I wont be racing back for the food any time soon and ill steer clear of the abrupt bartender. The little blonde girl behind the bar who served us the remainder of our visit is worth asking for....if I could only remember her name. Anyway, if I'm in the area again, I will stop in for a beer.",

    "text": "I have been to several Rock Bottoms including Denver, CO and this one was less than impressive. I'm new to Charlotte so I've been waiting to try this Rock Bottom out.  Went on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm. I took my young son with me so it was just dinner no alcohol. The restaurant wasn't very busy so we got seated right away.  Our server (which I didn't get his name) appeared about 5 minutes after we got seated, got our drinks and then we ordered.  We didn't see him again until after our food was brought to us. We only saw him twice after he checked to see if we had our food, and one of those two times was to hand us the check. The food was so-so.  My son had a hamburger which was delicious - my chicken bruschetta was fair but cold and the broccoli had no butter, seasoning, nothing.  It was over priced for what the meal consisted of. I gave two stars because  I was disappointed mainly with the service more so than the food. I've never had bad service or a bad meal at the Rock Bottoms I've been to in the past so was expecting the same high standards that I'm used to.  Might try again, but it will be a while.",

Stay away from the non-standard stuff like their Mexican or novelty sandwiches. I've been disappointed every time I tried to venture into that territory. The main dishes are generally pretty good, with my personal favorites being the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken and the Meatloaf.   It's a great place to have lunch uptown. When the weather is nice you can sit on the patio and people watch. It's a safe place to bring non-adventurous lunch guests, as the food and atmosphere will have them feeling right at home.",

The bar staff was helpful and generous with samples from their 8ish original beers. The Brown Ale is delicious (and award winning) and my favorite of the group.  While Rock Bottom features beer, they hang their hat on food. The nachos were loaded with fixin's, and the chili is chunky and decidedly above-average.   It's a relaxed, inviting and warm destination for anyone looking for an afterwork drink or evening out.",

    "text": "So.....I have a small group of pretty amazing employees and I thought I would treat them to a nice holiday dinner and a comedy show.  I never thought they would be combined.  They have 2 long tables reserved for us which was very nice.  We had pre-arranged a limited 4 item menu and for drink tickets to limit the alcohol consumption.  I sat down and saw the menus had our company name....nice touch. The waitress came to take drink orders and knew nothing about the tickets.  I had to send her to see the manager and get that straight before the booze started to flow.  Then one of my people asked who else was joining us.....as 6 of the menus had another company's name on them.   Let's say it went down hill from there.  Not everyone got salads.....the food took forever and then arrived cold and overcooked.  Nothing beats a grey steak and mashed potatoes you can pick up in one huge lump!!!  The funny part was, that they were not even properly garnished.  The steaks came unadorned, but the crispy onions they were supposed to include were on the chicken meals instead.  The delicious sounding \"maple bourbon glaze\" was totally invisible and tasteless, so I suspect that was left off as well.  Gordon Ramsey needs to be running the pass!!!!  After 2 1/2 hours.....still waiting on desert, I asked for the check as we were going to be late at the Comedy Zone for the planned comedy routine.  They then assured me that they could rush out desert.  The description was wonderful and I knew the staff....especially a select group would love triple chocolate brownies with caramel drizzle and vanilla ice cream.  So it arrived and was crunchy hard and the ice cream was a single melon ball scoop!!!!  People were so impressed!!!!!   NOT. So......I dropped about $800 after tip and could have taken the group to Longhorn for less and had a LOT better meal and service.   Might be a good bar to watch games.....it is not a good restaurant.  At least not for a small group of 16 people.  I suggest booking elsewhere.",

    "text": "My spouse and I have been here before in the afternoon when it wasn't too busy and we loved the beer, music, and service. We decided to come back and it was us and a group of friends and on a Saturday night so it was busy. They were low on staff and it was march madness and Saturday in Queen City, so taking all that into consideration we of course understood delays and such. When it came down to orders and service though, sadly was disappointed. Our friends shrimps came out ice cold with luke warm steak, forgot the glaze on the side, when recommended by the server and requested. The veggies were overly salty table round. And meats were not cooked to request and the servers forgot the eating utensils. I believe Rock Bottom needs some food warmer lamps under the order window or something. My spouse ordered a drink and since it was taking too long the server took it upon herself to make them their drink, but it was horrible. Let's just say there's a reason bartenders are the bartenders. Appreciate the effort, but we'd rather wait for the drink to be made properly. We also saw our server taking shots at another table and found it inappropriate to be drinking while working. Our group of friends also moved to the outdoors to get some air and my spouse apparently forgot their phone in our seating area, so I returned and there was another couple sitting there. I apologized and asked nicely if they have seen a phone, they said no and they offered to help me look. I then remember seeing someone lurking at our table so I approached several servers and asked about it and then I asked the hostess if anyone has seen a phone and the hostess searched and apologized and said no and if i leave my info at the desk they will call if anything turns up. I called the phone multiple times and it was already shut off when i knew it had sufficient battery. A server offered to go speak to the manager. It may seem ridiculous, but I did make a small scene searching for it. And it may seem rude but I had my suspicion it was one of the servers who took it. I was writing my information down and another server approached me saying one of the other servers found it and gave it to me.( And yup still shut off and if they had any intention to return it, it wouldn't have been shut off and when I turned it on it was set on mute.)  Obviously the one who took it did not want to confront me and apologize for \"attempting to steal\" my spouses phone. I was about to call the cops after writing my information down because of my suspicion and make a report, but didn't because we got it back and wanted to get the heck out of there and it left a bad taste in my mouth. It may be just a phone but it's the principle and respect of property and as a customer it was a disappointment. This is my FIRST review on yelp & most negative review on a restaurant personally. This place has reached Rockbottom.",

I didn't argue because I wasn't the one driving and I didn't really know better. Now I wonder what the other restaurant would've been like.  I was sold on Rock Bottom because my cousin said it has the best key lime cheesecake anywhere. I ordered some weird steak and shrimp combo and it was overcooked and forgettable. The martinis were decent tasting but not strong at all, and the service was dismal.   The cheesecake slice was giant and I required a take-out box for it, and the next morning it was pretty tasty. So... go there for a few martinis when they're on special and get some cheesecake if that's your thing, but don't expect to get in and out of there in under two hours.",

There was even some sort of traveling sports school event there with around 75 or more college students ordering at the same time as us, the place was extremely busy in all areas yet there wasn't a server or tender without a smile on their face, or a personality shining through. I must say. We had one of the best experiences we have ever had out anywhere in NC there at rock bottom.

It's right in the heart of downtown and it's huge--lots and lots of tables, along with a huge bar and plenty of outside seating--so it's pretty convenient for all sorts of days and times. It gets pretty crowded, especially during the lunch crunch, but because of its size, you'll never really have to wait all that long.   My girlfriend lives for their fish tacos, so if that's your thing, order away. I like their burgers and sandwiches--great club sandwich, good fish and chicken sandwiches, good reubens, great chicken finger sandwich. Roch Bottom features a lot of standard pub food, done up a little nicer than the options you'd find at most places. Though it's original, Rock Bottom has more of an Outback or Applebees feel than a pub. Not a bad thing.   They've got a great selection of beers, many of which are, obviously, their own creations. Try 'em all. They're really good.",

I think Jennifer's review from aol was right on is stating \"Rock Bottom Brewery is the Tom Hanks of Center City dining -- all-American, unassuming and very, very popular.\"  I went with a client and this spot has a little something for everyone (even home brewed root beer for those that don't drink - an excellent selection btw).  I sampled the burger and made me question my selection, however, I had to try the fish tacos because of the way they were served.  Side note, the only item I've ever loved on the taco bell menu was the double decker tacos because of the soft and hard shells... well this is the way their fish tacos are served, only with cheese holding the blue corn shell to the soft taco wrap.  I've had better fish tacos but this is still something I'd order again.    Lunchers tend to take their time and the service is always attentive, not pushy and generally very accommodating to the diner.  If you're in uptown and want a good beer (summer wheat and stouts were excellent), some americana fair or just a good spot to bring a client, this place is a great selection.  Enjoy",

Their menu offers a wide variety so it appeals to vegetarians, meat/burger lovers, those looking for smaller portions, and even has some good looking desserts as well. I had the waldorf chicken salad, which was pretty good. The baked apple crisps were a unique change from the norm. My husband had the 2 am burger, which comes with a fried egg, bacon and hashbrowns - it was a nice, thick burger and really appeals to you if you are hungry. The fries were ok - nothing special. Service was ok, as it took 20 minutes to get our beers delivered, but it was a busy Friday, and apparently the bar was low on glasses.",

    "text": "My friends and I were spontaneously looking for a casual dinner last Saturday. Duckworth's Uptown was our first choice, but there was no hope of getting a table there with the college football crowd camping out, so we went across the street to Rock Bottom. I'd been there a couple times before, and figured our experience would be fine (if nothing to write home about).  The hostess told us we could seat ourselves in the bar area, so we did. I thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area.  Then we waited. And waited. And waited. We asked for a server twice. I would have left at this point but half of our group was really hungry and I knew it would be tough to get a table at other nearby spots.   We did finally get a server, but I could tell she would have rather been anywhere else that night, and maybe she did go somewhere else because we didn't see much of her during our visit. Getting water took a long time. Getting cocktails took a long time. Placing an order took a long time. Our food (chicken sandwich, burger, salad, hot wings) took about an hour to arrive, and based on the temperate of my sandwich I'd guess it was sitting in the window for at least a quarter of that time. Getting our check took a long time.  I'd give only 1 star, but previous visits were acceptable.",

My husband was especially pleased with his stuffed poblanos.  All three of us ordered beer flights. I liked everything except for the IPA, which is normal for me (I'm not a big fan of IPAs). My favorite was the Black Velvet Lager.   Our server was on point. I was never left waiting for water refills, and he was friendly and efficient. Overall a very pleasant dining experience.",

I asked specifically if the lobster and shrimp tacos had pieces of lobster in it. The waitress said yes. There were tiny pieces of what looked like artificial crab. No lobster.  One of our party had Caesar salad. Caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat.  I'd give it zero stars but Yelp won't let me.",

The food was good, but nothing incredibly memorable. The asiago artichoke and crab dip appetizer was very tasty, but our burgers were nothing special.  I ordered their house beer, which had a nice flavor to it and went well with the food.  The restaurant itself has a nice brewhouse/restaurant atmosphere to it.  Servers were quite nice, and the service was prompt and efficient.  Personal tip: the outside patio is great during the daytime to watch the activity of downtown Charlotte, but after it gets dark, the people walking around get a lot sketchier.  Since your tables are next to the sidewalk, some of the nighttime folks may start messing with you.  Be warned.  Overall, though, this was a nice place to go and wouldn't mind going here again.",

    "text": "Visited Rock Bottom at about 4:45 on a Saturday.  Was surprised at how busy they were but we were still able to be seated quickly in a large comfortable booth overlooking the street.  I started with the Summer Honey Ale.  Meh.  I think I was expecting a bit more of a sweet/honey flavor.  I wish I had tried one of their other beers.  It comes in a large glass (I think bigger than a typical pint serving).  I had the stuffed poblano peppers.  I was curious (dubious?) so I asked my server.  She said that the filling is awesome and that the bites with the peppers had a kick.  She was spot on.  I really enjoyed the cheesey, chicken-y, chorizo-y filing.  The rice around the peppers was good too and it definitely seemed like a hearty portion.  Eventually, with sweat running down the side of my face, I scraped the remaining filling out of the second pepper and just ate it.  I enjoyed my pepper bites but was ready to stop the heat.  Our group shared some of the ice cream sandwiches.  Childish?  Yes.  Tasty?  Surely.  The plate comes with three ice cream sandwiches made with chocolate chip cookies, some strawberries, and a bowl of chocolate sauce.  My only wish was that the cookies were a bit softer.  In texture and look, they were over done with just lent additional difficulty to eating the messy treat.  Our server was very good and took excellent care of us.",

    "text": "I went to the famed Rock Bottom the other night, Friday Dec. 2, 2011 to celebrate a good friend's birthday.  We ended up getting there around 7:45pm on a Friday night to find the place very alive with people, both young and old, carousing, socializing and being merry.    My friends and the party I was attending were stationed in the bar area, to the left as you walk in.  Though there was a jumble of people standing around drinking and talking, a server promptly noticed we were new to the scene and took our drink orders and provided us with a menu to look over.  I ordered a \"light lager\" for my girlfriend and a \"Brown Ale\" draft for myself.  Draft beers were running $4 per pint on Friday night; which certainly isn't bad, but isn't a deal by any means.   As evening turned into a chilly night, the people I was with found a few tables in the bar area and placed food orders.  I ordered, the BBQ pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, and some sort of lobster and shrimp rolled into a black corn enchiladas.  As a devout BBQ lover, I found the sliders to be an extreme disappointment.  The BBQ was border-line cold and there was very little BBQ on each of the sliders.  As for the enchiladas, the appeal of my meal was more in the uniqueness of the dish than its actual taste.  It's not that the enchiladas were bad, they just left me wanting more.  My girlfriend got the steak with mashed-potatoes and green-beans.  I thought the steak was above par.  My girl friend said it was cooked to her specifications.    Overall, I felt the food was good not great, and the BBQ sliders were not up to BBQ code.  However, Rock Bottom offered the perfect ambiance to enjoy myself and my friend's birthday in splendid fashion.  The service WAS GREAT!  I wish I could recall my server's name, because I would love to give her a shot-out.  Despite the chaotic atmosphere that reigned throughout the bar, she was prompt, polite and accurate with everything.  TIPS: *Nice, classy atmosphere, *Nice seating area outside  *Parking can be found by turning either way on 7th street, including in the garage attached to Rock Bottom itself (KEEP YOUR TICKET!!  BRING IT IN WITH YOU!  ROCK BOTTOM VALIDATES PARKING, SEE THE HOSTESS.)  *Stay away from the BBQ Sliders  *Great, friendly service  *Good for parties or pre-gaming before going out somewhere else",

    "text": "I must say- this place, the food was really, really good. I probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars on the food alone. I ordered the grilled bruschetta chicken. Juicy and flavorful - excellent with the tomato and mozzarella. My friends' dinners looked really good as well- I had a bite of the bacon, chicken mac and cheese and the country fried chicken. Excellent food all around.   The problem with this place was our waitress in particular. Korin. She started off really sweet and cool.... And then went B*TCH on our table of 6. A bunch of rude comments and all and all unpleasant experience. My friend had ordered the house root beer before and when she took a sip this time, the root beer was flat and watered down. When the waitress was told, she immediately got defensive and said \"it's our house root beer\" so excuse me, it is supposed to be watered down and flat? My friend then said she had the root beer before and it tasted different. The waitress decided to blame the soda machine and check and get her another.   Her second mistake was when she came over to take our orders and said she would start with ladies first, the first lady she was talking about was chatting and the waitress said, \"um, can someone tap her...\"  The last and final mistake was that she mixed up all of checks or credit cards, I don't know what happened because when our cards were returned to us, we all had been charged the wrong bills! She didn't seem to know what to do, except suggest to run the cards again. But BLAMED US for the mix up and that we put our cards in the wrong bill. No! Rude rude rude!!!!  On our way out, I guess she had told the manager to cover her own behind.   I would go back for the food and that's about all I was happy with.",

We didn't want to wait for a long service so we opted for bar seating. I was surprised to see such an abbreviated lunch menu. Of course, they were out of the shrimp po boy I wanted, will have to come on another day for that. I went with the chicken spinach flatbread while the bf went for the Tuscan pasta. We waited for a little while but, were brought hot food. I found the chicken spinach flatbread bland and very dry, I think this would be solid lunch food if it came with some sauce or dip. The olive oil by itself does not cut it. The Tuscan pasta was a lite pasta with diced tomatoes, had a mild but, good flavor.   I doubt I'll come back and order the lunch specials at Rock Bottom, best to stick to the actual entree options and brews. Cheers!",

    "text": "Something for everyone; that's the title I would give rock bottom. I love the food and selection. My favorite item on the menu is the Cajun Pasta. It's a spicy rendition with onions, celery, green peppers, chicken, Andouille and shrimp and this delectable Cajun cream sauce with bread on the side. I always have enough for lunch the next day because it's a huge portion and the best part is that it's not dry.   They have recently updated and remolded the restaurant and menu. I like the enhancements of both. The menu has finger foods that are sure to get you by and crafted entrees to fill up before heading out.   The bartenders are creative and can provide what's on the menu and even what's not. They have a really nice flight special that you can sample a few before making a decision or make a date tasting out of it.   The location is not ideal but if you are Uptown for an event the food is better than your traditional white glove five star restaurant. On the weekends this place can get a little busy so be prepared however it is definitely worth the wait.",

The flights of beer were only $6 which was great and they write the name of the beer you're drinking which is a bonus. The reason for the missing star in my review is the service was lacking. They took a long time to come over to us we were sitting there watching every waiter/waitress go by for a while until someone came to us. We even walked up to the bar and asked if we had to order from them.",

I fact the waitress (Elisa) even asked if we'd like a delay of time between the appetizer and entree which arrived a few minutes after we finished our appetizer. My wife ordered the Chicken Mac which was very flavorful, extra cheesy and moist. I had the Fireman Signature burger (medium rare) which was cooked exactly how I like it. I'd also recommend the Charlotte Gold craft beer, it was fantastic. Lastly, all (except for drinks) of it was delivered to our table by the General Manager who brought out the kids meal first after stating that he was sure the kids were hungrier and needed their food first.  I was very impressed.",

The host did notice us looking around for our server and came over to help us, he actually did a better job taking care of us than our server... no offense to her because she was really sweet but was very uniformed and slow.

We were seated quickly for a Saturday night with no reservation and there didn't seem to be much of a wait, unless you had a larger group of people. We tried to call for a larger group previous to this date and there apparently is a cutoff time for calling ahead for larger groups.  Our service was very good and easy on the eyes which is always a pleasant factor when dining, considering the people who can be spotted in various North Carolina locales. Our food was fresh and nicely seasoned. I had the jambalaya which had a good amount of spiciness for a creole type dish. On the menu there were various other choices like macaroni and cheese, vegetables, pretzels for appetizers, etc.   I will return to Rock Bottom for both food and for drinks, hopefully catching a large table before they are all taken up.",

Everyone that I have visited the restaurant with raves about their burgers but the fish tacos are by far the best I have ever had! The beer that is brewed within the restaurant/brewery is also delicious and I make sure to get the beer sampler every time I go so that I do not have to pick just one. The atmosphere is also a huge highlight. Part of the restaurant is a laid back, sports bar type of restaurant while the other half has a swanky feel to it. You can definitely go in jeans and a t-shirt or dressed up for a night on the town and be comfortable. The bathrooms are always cleaned and are regularly checked and the service has never been poor. Sometimes, I consider driving the 2 hours just to go! Make sure to check out this place next time you are in Charlotte!",

The food was bad, yo. Like, below Applebee's bad. We split an order of guacamole. For $8.50, you get a tiny dish of it and a bunch of chips in a little bucket. What a crock. The guacamole was fine, but for $8.95, you can go to Vida over at Epicenter and get (as I wrote in a previous review) a veritable fuck-ton of it prepared tableside.  I also ordered the Southwestern Turkey burger. It sounded delightful - peppers mixed in with the meat, jack cheese, fried jalepenos - but tasted like garbage. The meat was tasteless but spicy, the jalepenos were in five tiny bits on top of the burger, the cheese was like plastic. The bun was overly bread-y. I ordered with a side of fruit, which was disappointingly not fresh.  My colleagues complained that their food sucked too: overly dry burger for $10 and a dried out piece of salmon for $18.50. What the fuck.  People, don't go here unless you want to get ripped off and eat shitty food.",

Friendly service and seemed like a good place for huge groups (there's no way any one there could have missed the giant family reunion here where everyone wore the exact same patterned clothing in shirt or dress form!)   Food was good, pretty good pizza (too thin and floppy for me), jambalaya was pretty good, spicy, and was made with orzo pasta.   Parking didn't seem like too much of a pain, there was a lot across the street and a garage attached to the building. Overall, it was pretty alright.",

It is almost impossible to spend under $10 for lunch there.  That said, the sandwiches are reasonably good, as are the fries. Some rave about their mac & cheese, but I wasn't impressed. Gluey and tasteless.  I've had to send back burgers on more than one occasion to get it to the ordered temperature.   I do like their chicken sandwiches a lot. A nice sized portion with tasty options. The salads are also quite good, but too big. I'd be happy to pay half price for half the salad.  Overall, good, not great.",

Well I am raving on the Jalapeno Burger. Will be going back. Oh yea get the beer flight. 5  6oz glasses of good beer types and the price of one 16oz beer. Well ok close to that price.

We sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp. I had the pizza and it was mediocre at best.  The wings were fine, but nothing special.  The restaurant was busy, but wasn't packed.   Our food took a long time to come out.  We were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for 15 minutes.  It seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough, but the servers weren't getting the food to the tables.",

    "text": "A friend and I had dinner at Rock Bottom on a Saturday evening prior to attending an event at Spirit Square.  The bright red signage makes it easy to spot (we parked at the 7th St garage and it was a short walk).  Surprisingly when we arrived at 5:45, there was already a 30 minute wait (Bobcats game, Panthers game tomorrow, a few other \"events\" in addition to the small venue concert that we were going to were going on).  But True to what the hostess said, exactly 30 minutes later our buzzer buzzed.    Lovely restaurant, although very dark.  And when walking to the restroom, I though I was being led out into an alley, it's a hike.  Wide selection of menu items, it was hard to decide what to get.  Comfy seating.   We decided on the Jalapeno Spinach Cheese Dip which is served with tortillas to start with.  It was DELICIOUS.  Creamy and cheesy, the tortilla chips held up to dipping without breaking and they weren't overly salted.  The dip had a little bit of a kick to it without being overwhelming.  Very good start.  I ordered the 2:00 am burger, which is a burger topped with a fried egg, cheese and bacon, with a hashbrown underneath and mac n' cheese as a side (mac n' cheese is an upgrade from the fries side, so you'll be charged a buck for this - it says it clearly on the menu, so no big...).  The burger was meh - not bad by any means, but lacking flavor.  I ended up asking for some ketchup to try and do something to it.  The bun held up well to all of the toppings though, so I didn't even up with a soggy mess on my plate that I would need to eat with a knife and fork, so points for that.  The mac n' cheese was very good.  Nothing fancy, but well done.    The food was more of a 3.5, but our waitress was amazing, great service even with a packed house, so I will go with a 4.  If another Spirit Square event comes up, I would definitely eat here again.",

And what do you know, our order was delivered to our table 20 minutes later and there was a bun on her chicken sandwich. I was angry at this point and we had it sent back to the kitchen to be remade. The manager returns 5 minutes later with a new sandwich and offers us $10 off our next meal. I was suspicious about the food being delivered so soon but my sister ate it anyway -- the next day she broke out in a rash and had stomach pains because her food was contaminated.",

It would be better if they didn't label it as a mac and cheese, because it didn't taste like that at all to me. It came with a slice of french bread on the side, but it was plain. No butter on it or any on the side. Kinda weird.  My sister raved about her hazelnut crusted chicken, but I wasn't too impressed by that either.

Only complaint-random, crazy people screaming about Jesus and the noise from the Gold Rush and other CATS buses. Last time I went, our server was very sweet but it took almost 30 minutes for our lunch to make it out. I ordered a chicken sandwich and french fries-were they killing the chicken in the back?? I kept watching servers go by with other peoples food, practically salivating over the plates of french fries since I gave it up for Lent and just wanted one fry to make me happy. Thank God I didn't order their fish tacos (which I've heard are fantastic) because they probably would have had to go catch the fish to make it)  I heard they validate parking which is a pretty nice touch if you don't live or work in the Uptown area. You have to park in the parking deck either below or on the side of RB.  I like it for after work drinks as well but besides that, as Stephen K said, easy to enjoy and easy to forget.",

    "text": "A group of 7 of us went there this past weekend for lunch before the big college football game.  How was it? In a single word: Awful.  1) Told we'd wait 20 minutes for a table but saw other people being seated who got there after us - including a party of 8 people.  Finally got seated after 45 minutes but ONLY because we said something to the hostess and pointed out to her a set of three small tables that had sat empty for 10 minutes that we could join together for our party.  2) It took FOREVER to get drinks, much less order our food and get that in a timely manner.  We were very patient with anyone who came to our table to help, knowing that they were swamped - but we kept having to remind folks that we didn't have our drinks yet, or that we hadn't ordered yet, or that we still needed forks/knives so we could eat our food.  3) Wait staff was abysmal. As I said in the last bullet point, when our food was delivered, we had to ask for knives and forks to eat our food.  Even after the restaurant emptied out as the start time for the college football game approached, wait staff timeliness was still terrible. Our waitress would disappear completely to the point where we wondered if she'd ever come back.   4) The ONLY saving grace was that the food itself was not the worst.   The appetizers and entrees all arrived at the same time because our apps order wasn't put in when we placed the initial order, so it made for crowded conditions on the tables.  All total we were there for 2 1/2 hours because seating took forever, service was horrifically slow, and it was complete chaos.  I've lived in the CLT area for more than 10 years and the last time I went to this place I seem to recall it wasn't too bad.  My how times have changed.  I will NEVER go to this place again - and I don't recommend it for anyone.",

If you sign up for their rewards club you get an email with a coupon (usually a buy 1 get 1 free entree coupon) maybe every other month. They also run food/drink specials so be on the look out for that (this past summer they did 2 burgers/sides/2beers for $17. Can't beat that!).  I've tried a variety of different food options here and everything has always been pretty decent. The nachos are HUGE and a great starter if you come with a group. The tacos and shrimp/lobster enchiladas are my husband's and I's go to picks. However I recently got the bourbon salmon and it was delicious! We always get a side of mac-n-cheese. It's pretty darn good here. Overall the food is OK and a little above par from your typical sports bar.  The only down side-  I don't really care for their beers, but they have others available as draft or bottles. In addition, their service can be hit or miss. We never come here with high expectations, but it's within walking distance from our house and if we have a coupon it's worth it.",

I made the mistake of using the bathroom before ordering my food. The bathrooms were gross, the stall doors has nasty finger marks and white crud pasted all over them. Seriously, like a porno was shot in there.   This is a brew pub and you can see the brewing tanks by the bathrooms and to the side of the main dining room, they do give tours to diners. Due to diet restrictions, I had a vodka & club, it was mostly ice. I ordered the blackened fish tacos. They weren't blackened and covered in remoulade, I really question why I ate them. I couldn't eat the beans and rice and the bartender substituted that for vegetables. I think it was soggy slimy fried apples and sweet potatoes, but who the heck knows (not even the bartender knew what it was). I did eat the Brussels sprouts that were mixed in. My husband had a burger, nothing to write home about. We will take a pass on this place, just not good enough to chance again.",

When we arrived we were automatically greeted by a hostess who found out for us where we needed to sit for the event. She told and lead us to where we were to sit and after a few minutes a waiter came and greeted us. He gave us the menus and list of specialty cocktails. I decided on the peppermint bark martini and my friend got their eggnog. The martini was amazing! I love that it was coated with a chocolate rim with peppermint pieces and a candy cane. All of the flavors came together sooo well and you could taste the peppermint, chocolate, and vanilla!   The appetizers started coming around and all of them were amazing, especially the chicken and waffle \"taco\", which was a breaded and lightly sweetened piece of white chicken. We also tried their brushetta, which was topped with mushrooms and a light white cheese. Also, we tried their jalapeno poppers, which was an entire jalapeno stuffed with cojita cheese and lightly breaded.   My dinner was the ale chicken, which was just okay. I was not impressed by the chicken or the grilled vegetables, but I really liked the black beans which jad cojita cheese sprinkled on them.   Overall the service was good and the drinks were as well. I think it is worth returning to try again, but just another type of dish.",

So, we made our way there before our show last night (Hamilton!!), and the guy that seated us was pleasant and kind. Our waitress came over got our drink order (Dr. Pepper and Diet Coke), we put our app in, and after she came back with the app we put our food order in and by then we needed a refill on drinks. The waitress said she would be right back with them. Our food order came out from a person in the back, and us thinking she was coming back with the drinks we said, \"we were fine.\" We are half way done still no drinks and no waitress in sight. My friend goes to the bar to refill our drinks (no apologizes from the bartender...patrons should not be getting their own drinks!). We finish our meal, still no waitress. (What's the point of having bottomless fries if you never see your waitress again?!?) My friend then goes and ask the guy at the hostess stand if we can speak to someone. He tells the waitress we need her. She finally comes to the table, saying \"I didn't forget about you.\" Clearly she did. We explained we had to go get our own drinks and she said \"sorry\" and brought us the check. The 3 stars actually go to our food. The bacon wrapped poppers were delicious, her pizza looked amazing, and my bacon cheddar burger was cooked perfectly.  Sadly, there are just too many choices in Charlotte that if you can't keep up with your tables we can find another restaurant.",

One of my worst experiences was going there after a discovery place IMAX film, where they served the food on paper plates w/ plastic forks and knives because they did not want to run the dishwasher.  This was fairly early 6 pm SUN.",

    "text": "Visited on a Saturday night during a playoff game so they were pretty busy and we had a party of eight, but surprisingly there wasn't a super long wait to be seated. The waitress greeted us after about a fifteen minute wait, and was very pleasant. We placed our drink orders which came out pretty quickly and the alcoholic beverages were on point. Shortly after receiving our drinks we placed our appetizer and entree orders. The appetizers came out fine, but after ordering a second round of drinks everything there after was downhill. We waited quite sometime for our second round of drinks, but we were told the bar was backed up which was understandable but after waiting another twenty minutes with no drinks our patience began to wear thin. Another server showed up to the table to assist our waitress and said that she was sent to run the drinks and inquired about what we had ordered but she never returned. The entrees began to come out and all the orders except two were completely wrong, luckily the head chef for the night made every effort to correct our waitresses mistakes. The manager on duty got wind of all the issues we were having and also assisted in making sure everyone was taken care of. Our original server at this point had still not returned to the table, it wasn't until after most of the mistakes had been corrected that she showed up and then completely blamed it on the kitchen as if she was not the one who had put in our order incorrectly. The manager and chef were very accommodating taking several items off our tickets as well as giving everyone a forty percent discount for our patience. The food was amazing, everything was delicious. My only advice would be to hire better wait staff, or at least wait staff that works well under pressure.",

I had the Bacon Mac N Cheese which was really good but wow...my husband had the bourbonzola burger and it was delicious.   The appetizers are good too plus if you go to the Blumenthal Center for the Performing Arts and take your show ticket you get a free appetizer!  This is one of my new favorite places!   Thank you, Rock Bottom, for restoring my faith in Charlotte restaurants!",

    "text": "It's been a while since I've been in Rock Bottom but I was uptown for the Shriners parade on July 4th and figured this was a good place to find refreshment on a hot day.    The restaurant has limited hours right now because they are in the process of remodeling so I had to visit them after the parade instead of before.    Anyway, I started out with sampling their beers.  For a chain brewery, these aren't too bad.  The Belgian white was very refreshing and had a wheaty flavor.  The Hoppy Red ale was quite good and better than a normal red and then I moved up to the IPA which also had a smooth hoppy taste to it.    As for food, I just wanted something light so I ordered an appetizer...the Pepper Jack Chicken Nachos.  Well light isn't what I would call this.  The plate was huge and came with sides of salsa, sour cream and guacamole.   In the nachos, there were sliced onions which often seemed a bit too large.  Also the chicken was in large pieces and I think would have been better with smaller either shredded chicken or ground chicken.  The chicken was also very dry.  I'd also expect a little spice from something that had sliced jalapenos and pepper jack cheese but there wasn't any.  The salsa wasn't even spicy and it seemed like more of an italian chunky marinara sauce than a mexican salsa.  But hey the guac was good, if that's any consolation.  Service-wise, I sat at the bar and both of the bartenders were friendly and helpful.    So for beer, they get a 4.  for Service, they get a 4.  But for food, they get a 2.  And this averages out to slightly better than a 3.",

I ordered lobster & shrimp \"enchiladas\", which had practically no filling. It was just a rolled tortilla with a few shrimp and pieces of lobster meat on top. The two people I was with both got burgers, one was charred to the point it was inedible (requested medium well) the other was also over cooked and came with giant chunks of onion even though he ordered it with no onions. Our server tried to take care of us by comping some of the meal so that was good but still would not recommend going here for food.",

Worse was that there was no flavor. It was just all around bland.   On the brighter side,  the bbq wings were good, so maybe I just ordered the wrong item.

    "text": "After an ACN convention our team went to this brewery to celebrate for dinner... We have a pretty large group about 40+ and was seated at different tables. Upon closing  he tabs, Andrea with management decided to call the NCPD because she couldn't manage her host  to close out all the tabs before we had to leave and there were one or two open tabs left. The police informed us about the situation and wouldn't allow the rest of the group to leave until the other tabs were paid and closed out.  After soaking with Andrea the \"manager\" who couldn't manage her host to close out the checks beforehand... First they said one of the table didn't pay for the food and after an hour of deliberating with the cops they figured the table that left already paid for their food but management is now stating the drinks have not been paid for.    I have never experienced such incompetence when it comes to dealing directly with your customers about closing out tabs for large parties. Andrea the manager could have approached one of us to resolve this matter before calling the cops... Seriously don't these officers have something else better to do instead of dealing with a problem or miscommunication like this? What kind of manager would do that specially of there is still a large group left behind even though some table have left already to head back to their hotels after a long day of convention...  In my opinion this is just plain poor management and my group were 95% Japanese from Japan. This was a very poor impression by getting the cops involved and not being able to handle this while my group was still in the restaurant and the cops informing my group that we would be all going to jail if a $120 tab was not paid.  Pointers for Andrea the \"manager\" communicate directly with your clients about open tabs left before calling the cops. Learn how to manage the floor to close out the bill since everyone at the table is no longer ordering. And last calling the cops to resolve issues you should handle yourself should be your last resort if the group left the restaurant already.  Seriously, these were our VIP Japanese colleagues and we did not come to Charlotte North Carolina to get a free meal... There are no free meals in America Andrea!  And if you fear about losing your job because you couldn't manage the floor to close out tabs... Then you don't belong in management!  We will never come back here for any meals on our next convention and maybe be corporate will not care about it... Maybe they will.... Bottom line is #Rockbottombrewery will never have any of my business or my colleagues business of patronism ever again when we come back to Charlotte, NC ever!  I wouldn't even give this place a star for this reason!",

While waiting we stood at the bar and watched the barmaid that had a permanent scowl on her face. Once seated our waitress took our drink order (waters) and said she would be right back. At that time the restaurant was half empty. She instead went to the terminal and entered past tickets for over 10 minutes. She came back to the table, apologized for the delay and said, \"oops, I forgot your waters\". Several minutes later she returned to take our orders. I ordered the pretzel chicken, she said, \"I think we might be outta that\", so I ordered something else. My husband ordered the steak fajitas. Even though she apologized many times for the fact that she kept us waiting on drinks and order taking, instead of putting our order in immediately she went to her 3 other tables and chit chatted. Then it took over 20 additional minutes to receive our food. Two waiters brought steak fajitas to the table that were literally cold, no sizzle, completely cold to the touch. The mashed potatoes that my chicken was on had a film on them from sitting in the window too long and were cold. We then didn't touch the food and asked for the manager. After waiting an additional 10 minutes with no one coming to the table we left. The manager finally rushed out to catch us and when we explained our experience all he could say was, \"I don't know what is wrong with that girl.\" We then found ourselves sticking up for our waitress saying it wasn't all her fault. If anything manager Kevin and all the managers and owners of this restaurant, it's your fault. If your bar employees seemed pissed to be there, if your wait staff aren't trained on the basics, if your kitchen staff is making half cooked food and your food runners are running fajitas that have zero sizzle and are obviously cold, then management has failed. Manager Kevin did offer to email us a certificate to come back, AFTER my husband asked for his name, but it's not necessary, we have zero plans to ever waste time on Rock Bottom again. It was our first restaurant when we moved to Charlotte many years ago and we typically like to go when we are in the city but each time it has gotten worse and worse. We won't be back. Side note: We were starving when we finally left Rock Bottom at 10:16pm after all of that and went across the street to Duckworths. Their fajitas came out sizzling, my food was great, the waiter was friendly and on top of it. Thank goodness our evening wasn't a total waste.",

Most recently, we arrived shortly after 12 and were seated indoors, because the patio was full, and it took our server over 15 minutes to take our drink order. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips, which arrived 5 minutes before our food. Before I get to the food, the appetizer was cold and came with about 10 chips. Being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa. The chips were warm, however the salsa, stay away, unless you like Pace's from the grocery store. Really, are they kidding serving store bought salsa??? On to the food.  We ordered a good variety, stuffed peppers, chicken enchiladas, burger and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn! The enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water. Only positive, the fries, great seasoning! As for the service, I wish I took her name, but our waitress could have given two sh...about being there and you could tell. No refills, never saw her, except our order and bill, and very blah!

We had their nachos to start which were ok, it is a huge serving that comes with salsa to dip. I had the veggie tacos which were good, they had a crunchy shell covered with a soft tortilla which I actually enjoyed. It came with a side of rice and beans. I really liked the black beans but there was something about the rice that had a bad after taste.  My husband ordered the veggie burger and fries.

Nothing special, but the location and atmosphere has always been nice.  The insert menu excited me when I got here...Oktoberfest...was here. I love German food and I love Oktoberfest beers. I mean...love...really love Oktoberfest beers.   The German Burger: half a pound of meat with some cabbage, mushrooms, Swiss, and ketchup....on a fresh pretzel bun. Sounds great, right? Wrong! It tasted like a big meat patty...no flavor...nothing! Just plain boring.  The Oktoberfest Sampler Platter: Some type of \"Knackwurst\" corndog...which tasted pretty much like Pronto Pups at any northern state fair...not bad...but not warm in the middle. The fried corned beef and cabbage things were nice...but seemed pretty Irish to me. This also came with a fresh Bavarian pretzel with a variety of mustards...nice.  Now here we go! Rock Bottom describes their Oktoberfest beer as Full-bodied with a classic sweet flavor, Rocktoberfest is an award-winning Oktoberfest-style beer that is rich with a toasted malt character and finishes with a subtle crisp hop.  Now...if I was allowed to swear here...I would. In what world this beer is toasty, malty, finishing a tad hoppy...or award winning is beyond me. This beer is Budweiser with some caramel food coloring. This beer had no personality whatsoever! I can say that it finished nicely...by having no taste at all. Great job! I'm glad a terribly sub-par meal only set me back sixty bucks...I'd probably need a second job if I decided to eat somewhere with good food.",

I'm glad I didn't get charged for it even though I requested for the guac. The seasoned fries were good, but I had to wait a long time to get the 'next round'. I was already finished with my veggie burger by then & I'm the type of person that likes eating my fries WITH my burger. Overall, the veggie burger was tasty- I can say that.   The atmosphere was slow & lowkey. I was there during a weekday and after 6p, so it wasn't busy. Something also to note is parking. I can imagine parking isn't the best on the weekends. I lucked up and got free street parking across and on the street from the restaurant for free.",

    "text": "Since I moved to Charlotte I would drive and walk by this establishment. Finally got to go there this past Sunday. Our party consisted of 11 people. They put 3 tables together to accommodate our group. The shaft of the table was so loose I was afraid to put my drink on it. So I put it on the stable table that my wife was in front of. Food was good.(hadn't eaten all day, so anything I ate at 7pm would be good). I do like that they validate parking in the lot.  Sadly the highlight of the night was our waiter. It was noticeable and very easy to observe, that either he was having a bad day or he didn't want to be there. EVERYONE in our party kept commenting on that. He was asked if he had any recommendations of what to order, and he informed us of the signature dishes that had the fork and knife next to it. That wasn't the question! It felt like we were inconveniencing him when we needed a refill on our drinks. Interestingly he warmed up slightly at the end. I guess because we were leaving and it would be \"tip time.\"  I like the variety of the items on the menu, and would love to explore the other options because my food was good. I'm very hesitant to return because of the service. Highly disappointed that no attempt was made to correct the wobbling table. I can eat food at home on my sturdy table, I don't feel satisfied as a consumer paying to eat at an establishment where the table is in that condition.",

    "text": "Few experiences in my life compare to the cognitive dissonance I experienced at Rock Bottom.  The facilities are attractive, the beer and food are outstanding, and the environment is...horrific.  I visited on a quiet Wednesday night before the dreaded hurricane Florence announced herself and found few patrons in the restaurant or the bar.  Brianna was attentive to me after an inexplicable delay involving four other employees and one thirsty bar patron and served me a fantastic beer, the \"Monk's Mistress\", which lives up to it's name.    I'm a fan of dip and ordered the Asiago & Artichoke Dip, which arrived 15 minutes later.  By this time, I'd sampled the Rocktoberfest and Uptown Amber, which have great potential, except that my experience had been disrupted by an employee whose conduct was so disturbing as to completely ruin the experience.  This waitress (I did not see her actually wait on any patron, so I use the term loosely), approached the end of the bar in great haste and loudly complained about an unidentified male by the name of \"Big Country\" and then proceeded to employ every vulgar, crude and profane word I've heard in four decades of traveling the world, spending time in the military and interviewing accomplished criminals and politicians.  The five other bar patrons all turned to see what species of female possessed a mouth capable of so much filth at such a high volume who wasn't turning tricks five blocks away.  Even the man in town from Manhattan who ordered chardonnay and a salad sans crutons seemed frightened.  Oddly, none of the five employees assembled for the filthy tirade seemed conscious of the fact that every paying customer in the restaurant had turned to learn what had brought about the vulgar tirade.  Instead, they turned to shots of the beer, at which time Nasty Woman began employing explicit and boringly unsophisticated puns about one of the locally-brewed beers, \"Sourpuss\" and how her colleagues should pay close attention to the name and what they were \"really drinking\".  Perhaps I should not have been surprised that a mouth as vile as hers would be so well-acquainted with the consequences of poor hygiene.  The Asiago & Artichoke Dip had arrived and proved to be as good as I had hoped.  I had a coupon so I ordered the Shrimp and Crab Enchiladas.  By the time that arrived I had learned that the F-word could, in fact, be used in more than 26 ways, which is what I had previously though the official limit to be.  Needless to say, she failed to employ the word in any artistic sense or in any way that reflected admirably on the character of Sewer Mouth or her employer.  She had also proven beyond any doubt that she was well acquainted with the male reproductive organs and functions and the desire of some male mammals to attempt copulation with females of all species in ways which would not likely lead to procreation.  Recognizing that I could have a similar experience in a far cheaper environment, I asked for my food to go and finished my beer.  Brianna was pleasant, the food and beer was excellent, but the conduct of the staff was so wholly inconsistent with the location, the environment and the pricing that I must conclude the brand concept sprung from the mind of a genius who is now long-dead, retired or lost in a central American country, no doubt trying to forget what sprang from his mind in Charlotte, NC.  No establishment can earn a five star rating when it is so inhospitable to ladies of any background, nor can it earn a four star rating when gentlemen of any character cannot be exposed to the discourtesy of the staff's crass, loud, narcissistic conduct.  The outstanding beer and food  redeems this poor, aptly-named brand from a one star rating.  \"Rock Bottom\", indeed.",

    "text": "To be honest, I've never had an experience so terrible that I didn't know where to even start.  Upon arriving for our reservation, the place wasn't very busy, but there was nobody at the host stand to greet us, so we just waited about 5 minutes until a gentleman came up to greet us.  When we said we had reservations, he just sort of stared, looked confused, then after hesitating brought us to a booth that was just being cleared off.  We then sat down to look at menus.  After about 20 minutes, nobody had been to or even near our table.  We were hard-pressed to see anyone working the floor at all.  A few more tables were seated and everyone was looking around for wait staff.  Finally I went back up to the host stand, told him the dilemma, and his response was not even a word, but a blank stare.  After a few more minutes he actually came to the table to ask for our drink order with the enthusiasm of someone heading to death row.  After another 10 minutes, he returned with drinks and rudely asked for our dinner order.  Another 20 minutes went by, and still no actual wait staff had been to our table. Finally I flagged someone down and asked about the food.  Finally a few minutes later 3 out of the 4 meals arrived.  The first meal was a cobb salad with chicken.  It was the most bland, salad imaginable with rubber-like chicken. The second meal was a plate of nachos that had been sitting under a heat-lamp for so long that the cheese and jalapenos were dried out and the edges of the tortilla chips were blackened.  The third meal were two tostadas with chicken, or what appeared to be chicken.  One bite of that was enough for me. Then we waited for the fourth meal, which was a bowl of soup, for another 10 minutes. Finally I asked for a manager. While waiting for the manager, we asked for napkins and silverware, which had never been brought.  This is the best part....the server came over and dropped off four little plastic bags with cheap plastic silverware packaged with a little salt and pepper serving and the thinnest napkin I have ever seen inside.  She said they were \"out\" of silverware.  After glancing around to the half-empty dining room, I had to wonder what was going on.  We ordered a second round of drinks which came right as we were about to leave.  The manager was nice, but obviously overwhelmed and had no control over anything that was going on in the restaurant...she disappeared to never be seen again.  The restaurant was getting busier, and there were lines of people out the front door waiting, nobody at the host stand, and so many tables of dirty dishes it was disturbing.  I wouldn't be able to sleep at night without letting people know that this could be the very worst restaurant in all of Charlotte, and that is saying a LOT!  Stay away!  I know it is cliche, but this restaurant has hit \"Rock Bottom\".",

They took about 20 minutes but came out hot and were very good, had to ask for appetizer plates.  For our meal we ordered a Cob Salad and a shaved steak sandwich with garlic mashed potatoes. The salad was decent, except for the tomato ends and a couple rotten spots on 2 tomato pieces. The sandwich and potatoes were not hot. The sandwich had unmelted cheese on top and the bottom was severely burnt making it inedible. (See pictures)  The server never came back to ask us how our food was even though most of it wasn't eaten.   Overall on a scale of 1-10 I would rate the total experience as a 3.",

Because they are also a restaurant, I feel their food quality and options are much better than some of the other bars in the area.  They have all the games on and the TV's are marked (at least for the first games) so you can figure out where you want to sit.  They will have the sound on for Panthers games, but not sure how they decide what to audio if they aren't.  They are very accommodating.  Rock Bottom is a little further down the street than some other bars/options, which is actually nice for me, because it doesn't get as packed as quickly nor does it get as rowdy.    I don't have kids, but I feel if you want to come in with your family to watch the game you wouldn't have to worry about younger kids a lot of adult craziness.  They do have a patio in the very back past the bathrooms, but I've never sat out there and not sure if there are TV's out there or not.",

Obviously this isn't all the time but if your in the area you may want to look into it and see if they are doing anything special.  The environment was great. The courtyard is outside and open and has small fountains around. It's great if you want to kick back, laugh and converse with friends. You can essentially be as loud as you want and the atmosphere makes you feel free.  Customer service was great! They check in with you and make sure you have what you need.  I wasn't fond of the $3.99 up charge for a shrimp substitute because she didn't mention it. She said yeah sure. It would have been nice if she made the cost known.  The food was good. I had fried pickles and bacon shrimp Mac and cheese. There was nothing special about the food...you probably could get both options elsewhere (and they may be better) but it was still good. I definitely wasn't disappointed.  The drinks were also good. I got cocktails and green tea shots.  The pricing was $12-$18. Not too bad but  What really pushed this restaurant to 4 stars was the atmosphere, live music and service.  I'd recommend it.",

    "text": "We left hungry and thirsty.  We visited on a busy Sunday night. The place had several empty tables yet there was a wait so we figured they were short staffed. This is not a good sign but we had reservations so we stayed and regretted it, For starters, we waited 20 minutes to receive our beers! My daughter had to go to the bar to get hers, as we noticed other seated patrons were doing. As we waited, we noticed out server attending to too many tables, we counted at least seven. Our server was polite and tried hard, but was overwhelmed and could not keep up. To his credit, when we told him we had tickets to a show and he got our order in quickly.  When the food came to the table, we had no silverware on the table so we all starred hungry at our food and waited several minutes for tableware. The food was good, although the portions were small. My Chicken Waldorf was good but for once, I did not get enough dressing and ended up having to eat it 'dry' as I  could not get more dressing. My daughter ordered the smoked chicken tostadas. Beautifully presented but skimpy on quantity. However, my daughter ordered them served on a flour tortilla but they were served on corn shells instead, which she does not care for so she ended up eating a meal she did not really want. My son had the Jambalaya. Just the right amount of ingredients and spices made for an very good meal.    Their beers were excellent! This is one place we would like to return to just for the beer (if you can get served). During NFL games, drafts can be had for $3, a bargain.  I'm sad. This place has so much potential but poor service (management?) sacrifices a four star review down to a single star. Where were the managers? We did not see them helping. Why did they saddle a server with so many tables? Quality (of patrons) over quality of service reveals their values.  We left very disappointed, hungry and thirsty!  We all would've liked to enjoyed a desert and also we would've had more beers but Rock Bottom was incapable. Also, during the whole 90 minutes we were there, we were never able to get our waters refilled.   Given there are plenty of other fine establishments in uptown Charlotte, I recommend you spend you money elsewhere.",

    "text": "Valentine's Day dinner with 3 couples. We chose rock bottom because everyone had been there at some point. The beginning check in should've been a red flag for us to run. The hostess was answering phone calls, arranging menus and even walking off while telling us to hold on. There were several parties waiting to be checked in behind us. 10 minutes later we were sat.    Server came over greeted us promptly, took drink orders and asked if we wanted apps and gave us a chance to look over menu. Some drinks were returned from the bar while some never reached the table. This was how this went all night.    Oh boy, the kitchen and food. I ordered a 2am burger as well as my husband except his without hash browns. Runner brought food and started auctioning off food and when my husband and I couldn't decide who's was who's, HE GRABBED THE BUN OFF THE BURGER AND STARTED DISSECTING FOR HASHBROWNS! What in the world??!! Neither of us touched our food. Another couple ordered the Cajun Pasta and brewery beef tips. Both came out ice cold. Third and final couple, their order was the beef tips and a steak cooked medium rare. The beef tips came out cold as the others and the steak never hit the table.    Manager-- my husband walked off to find him so he could address it personally instead of making a scene. He told my husband he'd be back over in 30 seconds- several tens of minutes later, we had our server go find him. He said he'd bring out our checks. CHECKS? No. No checks. He agreed to comp food, especially what never hit the table. We paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip. We won't be back as we had to leave and go to Wendy's! Never ever again.",

My husband ordered the mac&cheese with chicken. I didn't try any of it but it looked so decadent and he practically licked the bowI! I had a burger with pepper jack cheese, house pickled onions, chipotle mayo, avocado...it was cooked to a perfect medium rare with just the right amount of char and juicy in the middle. A few improvements could be to attend to the rest rooms more frequently. They needed some tidying up, the paper towel dispenser was not working, and some stalls needed toilet paper. The service was good and friendly but could be a bit more attentive. I think if this place could get a bit more polished it would earn another star!",

They remodeled and it has a better -- more upscale, modern, but not pretentious -- vibe now. Service (at the bar) has always been great!  They brew their own beer (and have local charlotte brews on their guest taps), both of the recent Seasonal Brews I tried were great - most recently Rocktoberfest. And you can always get a sampler if you feel torn. Their menu selection is huge and has something for everyone. This weekend I tried the grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies - yumm! Next time, I'm eyeing the chicken fried chicken, ooo yeah.   The only not-so-nice thing I have to say is, skip the pretzels. You can do much better at other places in charlotte.   Other than that, I really like this place and I'm sure we'll be back!  P.S. They validate parking for the attached garage!",

Walked right in, we're seated, server was pleasant. Mentioned it was for mother in laws birthday and she was nice about it.  Ordered drinks and an appetizer. ..This is where things went slightly pear shaped. Server came back and told us the appetizer was delayed. No big beal, things happen.   Food comes and as always, was completely wonderful. Chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers. More pear shaped, waitress was no where to be found for 20 minutes. Wife was out of beer and spicy food minus drink.....she waited. Finally I got up and had to get another server to get a refill. She started with \"I am not your server....\" but said she would take care of it. To her credit she did.   Manager comes over, very nice, apologized for the appetizer and days she will cover it. Server shows up and is rather standoffish. Not rude per se but moody. Not sure if it was my stunt with the beer or the manager but either way not our fault. More waiting for desert, more drinks, something and then the server does show up with the bill no questions asked, not a thing.  The rating is not for the appetizer,  like I said things happen. It was not for the lack of drinks, it was for the apathy. At least come by and check on us, tell us the app is coming, but the server seemed to say, \"the app screwed my tip so why try\". If the place was hopping I would get it, but it was early afternoon.   Anyway long story short: great food, apathetic service, use to be a go to place even with the hour drive but we may  be finding another one.",

With that being said, there are hits & misses but overall I am a fan of being a fan at Rock Bottom.  Service is typically of acceptable quality. They can be a little slow in checking in, or filling water, but on the other hand we are there for a long time.   Food is actually pretty good. They also have game day specials on wings and nachos etc. Half nachos ($6) is good portion, but is without meat, which you can add for $2. They offer their own brew for beer (in case you don't know). They have beer special for Sundays as well. I can safely say that you can't go bad with ordering anything. I had a lobster & shrimp enchiladas and that was good.  Park is free, they validate for the garage under the restaurant. Be careful, my 1st time visit this season ended up charging me money to get out of the garage because the validation barcode was unclear (good news is I got my money back after contacting the parking garage office with proof of my validation via cell phone pic)  The only disappointing thing for our football watching days is: BY GOSH, stay on top of the game scheduling. We all know there are a new round of games kicking off at 4pm, so get the remotes ready and change over the moment 1pm game is over. PLEASE managers on duty??",

We had HORRIBLE service, so much so in fact, we weren't even greeted by a server for 22 minutes. It was when we stopped someone and asked if we could order we got an eye roll and a \"hang on\". Finally our server came over and we ordered our drinks. I ordered a Miller lite and was told you don't have domestic beers b/c you're a brewery. I mentioned to the server that I've been there many times and you do have a few domestic options. He said no, we don't. I asked if we could see a manager because I was sure there was an option. He said oh yeah, we have bud light. We got our drinks from another server and eventually our original server came back to take our order. We started with several appetizers for the table. They came out after a VERY long time and were awful. Cold and the nachos were burnt. Our server never came back to ask how things were. We stopped another server to order drinks again. Finally our server came back and asked what we would like for entrees. We declined and asked for the check. No manager ever came to our table. Awful experience from beginning to end.",

I would also suggest you try the artichoke/crab dip.  That was rather delicious.  I would say, give it a try but know.. There are much better places in the city.  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

Unfortunately, it (the pizza) arrived 15 minutes after the rest of our food because of waiter error.   Which we would normally excuse, but there were just too many problems with our lunch.  Clearly it was a bad day...tables near us stacked with dirty dishes for our entire visit.  The restaurant was not busy.  Our food took at least 30 minutes to arrive the first time (and there was an error. )     Why a burger and a salad would take that long on a slow day is beyond me.  The worst offense was my chicken Caesar salad, which had about 1 or 2 ounces of chicken on it.  I can safely say that there was substantially less than 1/4 of a chicken breast on this salad.  The chicken was supposed to be grilled.  It might have been, but it was NOT grilled for me...it had definitely been in the refrigerator.  Flavor was fine, caesar dressing was good.   Fries with burger were luke warm.  Let's just say the restaurant almost lived up to its name...the pizza was its saving grace.  As late as it was, there was no offer to comp the pizza.  We decided to not be jerks so we didn't insist.  And the waiter seemed like a nice guy.   But obviously we have no plans to go back.",

Since they brew theri own on site and have many different \"flavors\" to choose from this makes this place above par for actual bar food fare. Their hops have a bitter taste so I wouldn't say their crafted beers are for everyone, they would best be enjoyed by IPA lovers. Their bar food menu is alright, their fish tacos are pretty good. This is a good last minute place to check out a brew a snack and catch some updates on your favorite sports on their flat screens strategically placed through out the bar.",

I seem to remember a nice fish taco, but it might have been a black bean burrito. That's the sort of food you'll get. Enjoyable, but forgettable. This place's real appeal is a social one. Its outdoor seating is some of the best in Charlotte: in front you're on a busy street corner, perfect for people watching, and in back is a quieter courtyard. The interior is big and comfortable, so you'll want to linger and you'll never feel rushed. Bring good friends, and enjoy the beer.  Which brings us to their status as a brewery. Supposedly they brew a host of award winning beers on the premises, but nothing I have tasted has been exceptional. I suspect that in this regard, breweries are like car companies - there are more than enough awards to go around and even the most mediocre beers will win something. Or maybe I just don't appreciate good beer.",

    "text": "Oh man oh man! Another review, and this time from the well known Rock Bottom in downtown Charlotte. I came here with a friend who wanted some of their beer as well as their food. And sadly, I wasn't impressed. Inside though they completely changed the outlay of the dining area from the last time I came here, which was about 2 years ago... They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not.  I had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili.  Now, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty!  Another plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili!)  Now the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco.  Overall, not bad, food is average. Service is pretty good though. Next time though, I'm sticking away from those tacos.",

It was fairly cold and they seated our larger party right in front of the door so every time people came in and out during lunch time we got a cold draft air that froze us out while we ate.   Other than that the food was pretty good. We ordered our two year daughter the chicken quesadillas and they were amazing. Hands down the best quesadillas we have ever gotten at a restaurant. She, nor we, could stop eating them.   My husband got the wedge salad and chicken tortilla soup. The salad was the biggest wedge salad I've ever seen and his tortilla soup was delicious. You could definitely tell it was handmade and not premade/warmed up soup.   My MIL and I both had the Cuban Sandwich. I was not impressed with the sandwich itself. The pulled pork and ham inside were great. However, with the bread being dipped and fried it was overwhelming caked in bread compared to the amount of stuff inside the sandwich. I would not order it again. The fries were well seasoned and delicious.   My FIL had the Derby Burger and said it was great.   Overall for five us the cost of lunch was not as bad as one might expect for a restaurant of this quality. I thought the food was overall extremely good. The wait staff was great and prompt.   I down graded to  because my sandwich wasn't the best and we were not thrilled to freeze while we ate. We would definitely come back though.",

Finally our food came out, after of course watching the 2 booths of food pass us by. Appetizer came out with dinner and 1 person in our party, never got his burger. They brought out a philly steak sandwich as his order, which was wrong. By this time, we were there there for 90 mins and had to leave to go to our show.

The service can be lacking in the bar area, unless you are actually sitting at the bar, which is typically exceptional.  Food is quite good! Grilled fish tacos are a recommendation ads well as the veggie burger. Just a couple of recommendations but plenty more to choose from! Friendly staff!",

We ordered sangria margaritas, a Cosmo, and a mojito and none of us were pleased.   We ordered the crab dip which was amazing.   Our meals were like frozen dinners that just came out of the microwave.  I asked for my steak rare, it came out well done. My sides didn't come out till I was almost done with my meal. I got rice and it wasn't cooked...  Just very disappointed in this place because the restaurant itself is nice and the service was decent",

But, they made up for it with three free appetizers for nine of us.  Waiter and manager were fantastic.",

Hostess said it was a 40 minute wait, which ended up being an hour... Our server was nice. Although, not knowledgable about the beer when we had basic questions.  Boyfriend got a burger and said it was ok. You have to order sides separately here (absolutely hate that). The side order of fries was so small. I mean give me a break. I split the BBQ pizza with a friend and we enjoyed it. Great flavors and the fried onions on top have it a nice crunch. Also, I would highly recommend getting a side of the mac n cheese. Request adding bacon jam.",

Lets start with drinks.  The beer is made in house. I love the beer the current brew master has been doing a great job. I look forward to tapping part of the new brews he has made. The Bartends are freaking awesome and very cute(always a plus at a bar). They are super friendly and makes the best drinks in the world.    Food is awesome. I love the apps and whatever season menu item they come up with. This summer they had a luau with a pig roast. I was great. My favorite item off the menu is the steak cooked texas fire style. Trust me when you smell it you will want it. The salad are really great especially if you are on a diet.   So to sum it up great drinks, great food, awesome and cute staff. Why are you not there now?",

Never having had any Rock Bottom brews before (they don't have any in our state), we started with a flight of the basics and then ordered pints of a couple of others. We didn't have a single bad beer out of all of them. Granted, not all of them were amazing, but they were all at least good.  We ordered the soft pretzel appetizer, which really hit the spot. It came with two huge pretzels and a delicious dip. If you're a fan of soft pretzels, you'll want to get this.  The bartender was really friendly, talking to us at length about Charlotte and his previous residence Greenville (both places that we are considering for a future move), and we really appreciated the time he took to chat with us.  It may be a chain brewery, but the beer here was a fair sight better than at least one or two of the local breweries we visited during this tour of the Carolinas, so that says something!",

It had a typical single serving of pepperoni.  Pepperoni was almost tasteless.  Cheese was totally tasteless, could not even tell it was there.  Low quality pepperoni and cheese.  Sauce is just ok, but, very light on sauce. Ragu pizza quick sauce is tastier.  The crust was the \"brick oven style\" burnt crust. Or it was just burnt. Now, I don't mind a brick oven crust, but, your toppings have to be able to hold their own against the dry, powdery, charcoal taste of the crust.  Here, it was all burnt crust taste.    If you want something to munch while drinking, this may work. For a dedicated dinner food, you may be disappointed.",

Her \"greeting\" to us was, \"Do you guys know what you'd like?\" Placed our order and didn't see Jessica again for the rest of the night until we were ready for the check. No re-fills, no checking up on us, nothing. Also, I was brought the wrong entree, but it's not like Jessica was around for me to tell. Terrible experience.",

They do validate parking.   We started in the bar area, which was pretty crowded. We were hoping to grab a table but quickly found out they take reservations at those tables so we were moved to the main dining area once everyone arrived.   The bartenders were awesome! With so many beers on tap, I had no clue which to try first! So she let me sample some of her favorites and I found that the Kolsch was a winner!! It was light and refreshing and a perfect compliment to our appetizers.   We ordered the Brewery chicken nachos and Southwest egg rolls, both were delicious! The nachos come with an entire dish of freshly made salsa and the they load you up on the toppings: cheese, sour cream,black beans, chicken, onions, jalapenos and guacamole. The egg rolls are deep fried and stuffed with chicken, beans, red peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, corn and pepper jack cheese! Yum.   For dinner I went with the Southwest Turkey burger. The turkey burger is mixed with peppers and onions which adds a really nice flavor to the meat! They then top it with lettuce tomato, avocado mayo, fried peppers, sliced avocado and pepper jack cheese. I really enjoyed it! The fries weren't my favorite...they were shoe string cut and a bit too crunchy but at least they came out hot!   All in all, I'd definitely return and recommend a visit to anyone!",

They had some problems with not having the pretzel sticks so they comped us an appetizer and our waiter got my husband and his cousins order wrong they comped us that meal. We would definitely go here again everybody was real nice and the waiter although he was new we were the best group to learn from because we're very patient people we were there for about two and a half hours. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody we don't have one near us where in South Carolina.",

    "text": "Decided to stop in here for lunch on our vacation after going to Discovery Place.The hostess greeted us with a smile and sat us down. The Waiter came over promptly and informed us that he would be with us in a moment.  He came over and brought us our drinks and was very friendly about suggestions for the menu (even though I took a while). My wife got the Mac n' Chicken, per his recommendation, while I had the Cajun Fish Tacos.   Right off the bat just looking at the food was presented very nicely and prefessionally.  The taste of the Mac n' Chicken was so flavorful. It was the perfect amount of creaminess, and the breadcrumb crust added a nice bit of texture to it. The chicken was perfectly juicy and seasoned well.  The Cajun Fish Tacos were perfectly flaky and seasoned to perfection with a sauce that was to die for, while the black beans and rice complimented it perfectly.  Our server Edmund was very friendly and promptly refilled our drinks whenever they were low, as well as checking on us to make sure our food was ok or if we needed anything from time to time.   Overall this was a wonderful hole in the wall with amazing food and a friendly, casual atmosphere. It really topped off our visit to Charlotte and definitely makes me and my wife want to come back",

It was one of my friends' birthday so we needed to discreetly order him a birthday slice of cake while he was in the restroom. No biggie overall. I'd definitely come back for the food and the atmosphere. Would've given 4 stars but the not so clean cups took it down to a 3.",

We came again this past Saturday for lunch & I guess they do not care about the staff that works there during this time! Our service was horrible, our appetizer never came out BEFORE our meal! We got our macaroni & it was so cold we could not even eat it! We sent it back, asked if we could atleast go ahead & get our appetizer while we were waiting on our new plates to come out (which by the way we never send food back, but this was just too cold to eat) Well.., our new plates came out instead of our appetizer which was fine... About 15 min later (almost done with our lunch) she brings our appetizer out!! We were like umm we don't really need this anymore she said \"sorry our chef already made it\" ......... my mom ate a few bites of it which was fine but it was still on our bill which was pretty ridiculous, a manager never came & apologized for the cold food which is pretty standard at most places. Don't know, overall this place is kind of a joke for service/food   Too many other restaurants in Charlotte to need to go back here",

Well, apparently they have remodeled in the last year or so, and now have a nice modern ambiance.   The menu was not at all what I remembered, and that was a plus. I ordered the Chicken-fried-chicken, and my husband had the Classic Mac'n Chicken. Let me just say, it was the best chicken fried chicken I've ever had. The meat was so light and delicious! The mashed  potatoes were good, but nothing to write about. His Mac'n \"roasted\" Chicken was perfect. He loved every bite of it. The portion looked small, but ended up being just enough to fill him up.   We were there on a Saturday for lunch. Surprisingly there were quit a few families there with small, very small children. There was ample seating all over the restaurant, but the hostess sat us right beside a high-chair, with a whinny baby in it. Of course, I immediately asked to be moved and they accommodated us with no problem. Later more small children came in, and of course the hostess sat the kids right near us rather than near the other children.   My advice for all hostess is to sit children near other children and couples near other couples. It makes for a much better meal.",

I wasn't particularly hungry and ordered the Mexican Street Tacos. They were tiny - with a speck of fish, regular old hot sauce, and some slaw. They were disappointing to say the least and if I were being a diva, I would've sent them back. I would discourage anyone from ordering these disappointing mini flavorless tacos. My friend ordered chips and guacamole. It was served in a tiny bowl that you would see in an elementary cafeteria for your sides. NOT what you would expect for an appetizer. It was the size you would expect if you ordered guacamole on something else. I'll give this place another shot later, but the food needs to get up to par with the restaurant's cool atmosphere and service.",

Bad if you're totally indecisive like me. =) There is such a big variety, you will definitely find something you like and if you don't you're not human. Luckily, I had a friend recommend the fish tacos so I went with that. It was a hard taco wrapped in a soft taco with melted pepper jack cheese, and all the regular taco garnishes. Was fantastic. A little on the spicy side for me, but I'm truly a baby when it comes to that so don't go by my spicy judgment. Also, I want to add that the server was extremely nice by letting me only get the tacos. I didn't want the extra rice & beans so she took a couple dollars of the meal price and just gave me the tacos.   Obviously Rock Bottom is known for their beers and they definitely had a great selection to offer. I tried a few =) but ended up really liking the Brown Ale the best.   They were packed when we went but we didn't have to wait too long for our food and our service was on point! Clean place too.   Would definitely hit up this place if I'm ever back in Charlotte again. =) Go try it!.",

First off, this place encompasses half a city block...well not really, but it is pretty huge. We decided to sit outside on the patio, but the inside looked huge, with a large bar, 2 pool tables, & several seating areas. The place wasn't too packed, but it was after the lunch crowd hour so I'm sure we caught it at a light time.  As for the menu, while very good, it's just a little heavy for a lunch menu. Maybe I ordered something a little too filling, but from what I saw on the menu, everything was more suited to the dinner crowd. If they had lunch portions, then I think this could make it a little better place to grab lunch. The food was great though & I'd definitely consider going back for dinner next time.  The one thing I regret not doing was ordering one of their beers. I've heard how good some of them are & was planning on ordering a pint, but my meal was too filiing & I couldn't see myself downing anything else.  I'll be back for dinner here next time, & remember to order my beer before I eat my meal.",

But of course, most places with big menus have lots of food that is between pretty good and pretty mediocre.  I had an okay bowl of chili, my guest had a chicken pot pie  that she did not care for.  Burgers and sandwiches are solid.  We all loved the excellent, addictive fries: they're the thin snacky types full of potatoey flavor. Oh man and I tried the seasonal beer - a bock - which was a pretty good deal.  We figured that it was 25% more beer than the standard serving but at only 12.5% higher cost.

Fiance ordered bison burger and ended up getting a 2am with egg, etc. I had garden salad which was good however my Mac n'Chicken had absolutely no roasted chicken in it whatsoever. Apparently it's supposed to be \"loaded\" with roasted chicken. Informed manager and he brought us what we initially ordered but the Mac and cheese with roasted chicken was swimming in grease and oil. Fiance ended up with a bison burger that looked like a slider on a regular sized bun. Bun was also cold like just out of the refrigerator. Sent that back too. Manager apologized and offered us another beer, we asked for the meal to be comped. When server asked us how our final meal was once my fiance got a normal sized burger I asked if there was supposed to be that much grease in the Mac and cheese and all she said with a shrug of the shoulders was, \"I think so.\" Unacceptable. When she came back with the check she ran off with the Mac and cheese not even asking if I wanted it boxed. Food was comped but drinks still on check. After waiting 10 minutes we had to bring the check in to pay; fiance ended up asking for the manager to let him know what happened after he brought us the corrected meals. The first thing out of his mouth was \"it's her.\" He was asked by the manager not to post anything on Yelp but I promised nothing. Let's hope the manager can move this place in to a more professional establishment.",

    "text": "Ate here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday. We had a party of approx. 10 people. We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night.  That was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food.  Going back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back.   Our best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it.  Definitely will not return.",

The bar area is nice as well and spacious which is something sometimes overlooked by other establishments.  Give me room to drink and socialize!  Anyway, I've been here on multiple locations both dinner and lunches and never been disappointed at all.  They have a great selection of food (online menu is available), from shrimp and grits, to great sandwich's, steaks and seafood.    I will also tell you the service has never been bad, for me at least.  Always prompt and never lacking.   Bottom line for Rock Bottom is......you can't go wrong here!",

This is basically a glorified Applebees, but if you need a place to get a beer and some simple appetizers, or if you love fat and salt, a good bet. They do have a good beer selection and sitting at the bar can be interesting, but every bar is interesting.",

We tried to order a pitcher of the IPA and the waitress stops us and is like do you like IPAS? do you know what your ordering? i was like yes i like IPAS im capable of ordering a beer like a grown up. maybe next time be like hey our ipa is exceptionally hoppy compared to other ipas, is that alright for you? After finally ordering a pitcher of beer (there were six of us, so four of us had one beer) the waitress tells us that it is such a high gravity, she says 9% that if any of us have more than three she'll have to start figuring out who the DD is and maybe cut people off. Not only was it an uncomfortable comment, but we looked back at the menu and the beer was only 5.7%. Needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks. Then when the waitress brought out our chili, she told us that the green onions looked nasty and she didn't feel comfortable serving them. I was kind of grossed out by that point. Couldn't you have just lied to me and told me you were out? I don't wanna hear about nasty things in the kitchen, it made me really not want to eat. Luckily the food was good, however the service was reason enough not to return.",

I reviewed Yelp but most of the Downtown spots were noted as dressy or trendy attire establishments. From a 5 hour ride most of us were just comfortable in jeans and tees so nothing to dapper. The concierge at the hotel recommended the Rock Bottom so we gave it a shot. The place was excellent with its open air styling and the drinks were on spot. We ordered the southwest eggrolls as a app and started to order another plate of them and then we remembered we had more food coming! They were that good. I ordered the 14 Ribye with bourbonzola topping. Couldnt have been a more delicious and tender piece of meat. . The seaon veggies and chedder mash were no second. Everything on my plate could not have been anybetter. Check it out . It was worth the visit. And the house brews seemed to hit the spot with the guys that were with me.",
