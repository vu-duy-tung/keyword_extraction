But, they've always made up for it by giving a discount, free gift card, etc.  My daughter and I enjoy coming to this restaurant.  My favorite is the New Orleans salmon and shrimp.  Delicious!  I always have to fight with myself to not eat too many cheddar biscuits.  Not sure what was or is going on with this Red Lobster.  Used to be crowded all the time.  Not so much anymore.  I really want them to succeed.  I've been going to Red Lobster for 30+ years.  Love the variety and it's generally affordable depending, of course, on what you order.",

Well, it is more stylish than the Pineville location and more smiling faces.  The service is also better for now and hope they keep it up. The $10 FB promotion was enough to get us through the doors and as crowded as it was(people were waiting outside) more than just I love a deal.  The food was tasty and biscuits hot & delicious. Our server Zac provided some of the best RL service we have had in years. He kept a smile, was knowledgeable about the menu and a biggie for me-- anticipated our table's needs.  It irks me to flag down my server to get a refill, napkins, take away plates, etc.  One gripe would be they were quoting tables 45-50 minutes on Sat evening at 8pmish. In the dining room, we could see many booths& tables not bussed. Maybe if they keep their busboys on top of things, they will not have those long waits. We guests prefer to wait at table.Hint: we may be more inclined to order an appetizer/drinks while waiting.  Not a 5 star dinner nor the  best seafood in the land, but it will have your belly full of a decent & affordable  (insert coupon) meal.",

    "text": "This is my 2nd time ever at a Red Lobster. That reason is because I don't like seafood. But it was my bf's 23rd birthday, and he was looking forward to dining here. Heck, even I was because he was excited about it.  I definitely love the exterior and the interior. Very nicely put together. I do have a complaint, they don't take reservations. I don't like waiting for 20-30 minutes just to get a table, but it was okay I guess. The biscuits were pretty good when they come out hot, but I always prefer regular bread with the butter. That's always the best. Another one of my biggest complaints would have to be our waitress. She was extremely nice, but always seemed like she was in a hurry. That and it took forever for us to even order our food.  We had the Caesar salad, and I was not impressed. Very few salad to start with, the dressing is gunky and messy, and the croutons are like biting into rocks. I had the Parmesan Chicken Pasta, which had a chicken breast covered in crispy breadcrumbs,  and curly pasta with broccoli at the bottom. It was okay, but I was really expecting something better. My bf had the Admiral's Feast, but his biggest complaint was EVERYTHING on that plate was fried. I even had a bite of the shrimp and I didn't like it. It was very poorly breaded and the texture was really gooey. The prices are also a little ridiculous. It was about $40 for just the two of us. If the food quality and the service was better, I wouldn't have much of an issue. I don't think I'll be coming back here.",

Again, too greasy to eat, both fish and fries. My wife had a platter.

I've probably been the Matthews Red Lobster ten times since it opened.  At least three times of these visits I was told there would be a 10-15 minute wait even though the restaurant was 2/3 empty.  It's a 20 minute drive from my house and the hassles of Independence Boulevard to show up and be told you can't have one of the zillion empty tables because they haven't staffed up properly REPEATEDLY.  I find that insulting and disrespectful to customers to waste their time like that.  Having said that, if  you ever do get seated, they do a really good job.  The food and service there are as good or better than at most Red Lobster restaurants I've been to (probably 15 or so in ten different states).  However, not sure it's worth the likelihood of being unable to get one of the open tables.",

    "text": "Our son wanted a lobster and steak dinner before leaving to go back to his base in Tx. We chose Red Lobster and what a mistake we made.  The service to begin with was great, our waitress was kind and right on top of things until the arrival of our food and it was downhill from there.     We ordered a couple of appetizers which were good and then immediately we were served our salad's, A little wait would have been nice. Then our main course arrived and the steaks that were ordered medium came out so rare you wondered if they even touched the grill and they came without the lobster. The server placed them on the table, said enjoy and left before we could tell him that we didn't receive our lobsters and that the steaks were undercooked. We finally got the attention of the waitress and the manager came over and asked what the problem was, which we told him. He apologized and took the steaks to have them cooked the way we ordered them which was medium, and also stated that they were a little behind with the lobster. The other dish that was ordered was a grilled flounder which was so distasteful due to whatever seasoning they are now using, it appears on everything as the lobster even had the seasoning on it. Literally 2 bites was taken of the flounder and that was it. As far as the waitress there was no \"how is your meal?\", or \"Is something wrong with your meal?\" from the waitress. She did not mention once if there was a problem with the flounder as it was moved to the side uneaten throughout the entire meal. As a matter of fact once the steaks' were returned to the kitchen the service turned in the other direction and was awful. Needless to say we will not be going back to this Red Lobster again, nor recommending it to anyone. This has to go on the list as one of the worst.",

But this time around, a new one has opened up in my community in Matthews NC and it opened yesterday I went today just to use the gift card that I was given on my last visit and of course to support my local community.  Well it's really nice, and clean the staff are amazing.  Very helpful and polite people, and I know it's only because it's just it's second day of being in service.  Or who knows maybe the kindness will last even after the niceness go away....lol.  Any who the service was really slow, and I think it's because they are all trying to still get into their grooves.  We went around 5 and didn't leave til almost 8 and that's because we were waiting on food to come out, things to take home it was just crazy.  I ordered the steak again because I was impressed the last time, and this time I was very disappointed. Besides the fact that it didn't come out until I was bored of waiting for it.  But because it was done at all, I asked for it well and I got medium well and I'm not a fan of that.  By this time I was tired and ready to go, so I could stop by a burger joint and get a burger.  So I didn't get anything in it's place we waited for 30 minutes or more for the desserts, so needless to say but I'm going to I will never go back.  I felt it was my duty to support and that's what I did now I can say I did and that's it.....the end.",

Appetizers came out within five minutes and our meals were out within 20 minutes. We went for lobster fest, and we were not disappointed. The lobsters were perfectly broiled; the shrimp or perfectly steamed, and the sirloin steak was as I ordered it-medium rare. The string beans with sun-dried tomatoes were excellent.

After about 20 minutes we bellied up to the bar to have a drink while we waited.  The bar itself was covered in a thick film of greasy finger prints and beer. I asked the busy bartender for a rag to wipe it. Without responding or looking at us, she was visibly aggravated and half ass wiped the bar, continuing to ignore our many thanks.  I ordered a $5 beer. The glass was filthy. I'm really not that picky (yes I guess I don't mind drinking beer from a dirty glass) and did not want to irritate her further, so I kept quiet.  We were soon seated and I ordered another beer from our server. This time there was a full feather floating in my glass. A feather!!? The server sent the manager over who apologized about sending out 2 nasty $5 glasses of beer. He said he would comp our check.  We ordered seafood platters of what can only be described as bagged pre breaded frozen less-than-fast food-quality crap. I would have preferred ANY fast food chain to this food. $20 a plate!?!? Bahaha! I will NEVER spend any money at a Red Lobster again!  We had to go to the bar to ask for silver wear after our food came. Our waiter only checked on us ONCE. We complained yet again. It was ok. The manager was comping for the beer at least.   *Ahem*  He took $2 off of our bill.  $2.",

Coconut shrimp were okay and the small piece of salmon was lost on my large seemingly empty plate.  The side of mashed sweet potatoes had a \"bourbon\" glaze and pecans.

My husband called in the early afternoon and was told that we would be okay as long as we called 30 minutes prior so they can ensure they would have a table ready by 6:30PM.  My husband called 45min in advance to confirm. We arrived at 6PM and was told by the hostess that they are working on getting our table ready. We checked on our table several times, and were told that they were just waiting on another party to finish up. Our whole party was present and we weren't seated until after 8PM and  while waiting left with absolutely no seating with 5 children including two infants.  The manager did apologize and offered us three appetizers on the house which was nice. We all ordered our food, and it took over an hour to come out- COLD! The shrimp wasn't cooked through, and the broccoli for our infants was not cooked either. We addressed several complaints to the manager on staff as well as the servers.   We were assigned two servers, one of which wasn't present 80% of the time leaving us without refills on drinks. We even asked the other server if she had left for the day. We did not leave this location to nearly 11PM and if anyone who has young children, this is probably the most stressful time when they are on a routine schedule. We even had to put our youngest in pajamas and put her to sleep in her carseat because it was so late.  This could have all been avoided had the table been ready at the promised time!!!! We understand that things like this do happen occasionally but we should have been told UP FRONT that we more than likely will not be able to have a table ready at that time. We wouldn't have been as upset if the food came out as what we would have expected for the 'Red Lobster standard.' This was my husbands birthday, and it was ruined. We had plans following this meal that had to be cancelled due to the timing issues with this restaurant. We have been accommodated at other restaurants such as olive garden with even BIGGER parties and had absolutely no issues.  We are extremely disappointed in the food as well as service.  A table should NOT BE PROMISED if it cannot be accommodated.  Had we known this, we would have went somewhere else. We will NOT recommend this restaurant chain for ANYONE who needs a large party accommodated going forward.",

    "text": "The 1 star is only left because there is no option for minus stars, with that said...... I dragged my husband here kicking and screaming trying to convince him they had good food since all my experiences in NY locations were amazing. We sat down and ordered and it took 20 minutes just to get our drinks....which were very good . Then it took us another 20 to get someone to take our order.   Now I have to tell you there was more than enough staff and only a total of 6 patrons, 3 couples in this entire restaurant.  What we ordered: coconut shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, parmasean crusted tilapia, with baked potato and sides of lobster tails  What we got: the shrimp was edible, mushrooms which were whole uncooked with cheese and breadcrumbs haphazardly thrown on top, tilapia which had bread crumbs and a tiny bit of shaved parmasean on top, baked potatoes which were raw and broccoli that was raw. And the lobster tails had barely any lobster, were so rubbery and over cooked it all must have shrunk to what looked like a wishbone.  It took almost an hour to bring this to us.  What the manager said was \" oh we were out of a lot of stuff, the truck just came in now\"  so let me ask you, as the manager did you not think to tell your  staff to notify the patrons of this, and have them suggest something that your cooks weren't going to I love Lucy through cooking?  The manager ended up not charging us for any of the food as he agreed it was in edible, but I had my husband saying told you so and apologizing to me because he felt bad that we wasted a night going to this place.    We will never ever go back to red lobster in NC for fear they are not close enough to a coast to have fresh fish and I think that May have been a factor as well.",

Beverages were ordered. Draft beers took 20  min to arrive at the tables (and 3 requests). My wife and Daughter ordered \"lobster feast\" which required FOUR REQUESTS for Crackers. I requested a steak medium rare.... mine arrived WELL DONE. it was a complete train wreck. My food was sent back.... the ladies food became cold while they waited on Crackers. This was an awful experience. I was more disappointed when a manager did not come check on us once food started going back to the kitchen. WHY???? The wait staff blamed the bar, kitchen, anything she could do to keep blame off herself.... her other tables were behind as well... this wait staff member was clearly in the weeds. A manager needed to be involved....and to top it off ...we were not offered desert or a birthday song for our daughter... and the wait staff was very aware of the request. Poor experience.... needs much improvement.",

    "text": "My son came to see us before he had to leave for a tour of duty over seas. Before he left (tomorrow) we wanted to have a nice meal together. We were hoping to have a great meal to remember. We got there early (before 6) and there were a few people there. Where do they seat us? right by the kitchen. Lots of empty tables. The waitress was very nice and took our orders. The hor's derves come. We ordered the Calamari and an order of Clams. The Clams were very small and were more like bits and pieces. The Calamari was good but not much of it. Then our main course comes. My son and I ordered the NY strip and Lobster. My wife ordered Flounder. My wife received her Flounder with a weird seasoning on it. We tried to scrape it off but could not get enough off, She could not eat it. My son and I also received our steaks without the lobster(we ordered the steaks medium). Both steaks were literally raw. In my whole life I have never sent anything back but I did this time the manager came over and was very nice and said he would comp one of the meals. The steaks and lobster came out a little later. The lobster was ok. I don't know how they did it but half my steak was just right. The other half was over done. Now I try to eat it. What a poor cut of meat. It had so much gristle that I could not eat it. To top it off, once we sent the steaks back the waitress did everything she could to avoid us!   I guess we need to drive the extra mile and go to Pineville if we want to eat at Red Lobster.",

There was 6 of us total that walked in at 8:15 on a Friday night and was told that there was a 25 minute wait which was actually pretty accurate. We sit at the table and 10 minutes goes by and still no server. Finally our server comes by to take our drink orders and appetizer order. 15 minutes goes by and he never got us our drinks and so he starts helping the other table behind us and then this new server (which she was really nice) came by and said she's going to be helping us out tonight. Another 10 minutes goes by and finally we got our drinks except for one of us which ordered a beer. After a few minutes he finally got his beer which had some sort of lipstick on the rim of it and had to send that back. Since we waited so long for our drinks, she was nice enough to give us a free appetizer. After a little over an hour we finally got our food which half of ours was cold and no one had eaten their food. After asking for a manager 4 times, this \"manager\" came over to our table (she wasn't really a manger she was like an acting manager) and was nice about it and told us the kitchen was crashing and they were very understaffed. Overall DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE!! Go to Captain Steve's instead.",

What, a seafood restaurant and just opening for the day were out of salmon! So I had to order another fish, which the menu print said I had a choice of sauce, but the waitress never mentioned the sauce until I asked her about it once it arrived., so then I had to wait for her to bring the side of sauce.   The food was barely warm.  I never received a refill of water. I waited 5 minutes for someone to bring the bill after waving down 2 or 3 service people and then 8 minutes for someone to bring back my change.!  Never again.",

I was in red Lobster for a while (2 hours ) it took like 35 min to get the first refill. If it wasn't for the shift manager asking was everything ok, I wouldn't have received a water refill . I just asked for my bill and left. The female supervisor that was on shift at the time was not any help. After  explaining to her about my food and I thanking her for a refill on my water. I continued to still wait on my shrimp refill. She just said I apologize and gave our receipt as requested . I even went to the red lobster website and did the costumer survey. The store manager never reached out. Do not go to this location . I spend a lot of money during endless shrimp and this experience has been the worst ever . Go to concord mills or pineville location for better service! The worst experience ever!",

She didn't \"pretend\" she forgot or didn't know that stuff is like crack and that's why people come to Red Lobster in the first place!!!  I digress...so the service was great.  So, yeah, the bread was good, the cup of clam chowder I ordered for an app. was great, and I would recommend it to anyone, even if your not a big chowder fan.  I did the whole build your own meal thing, and chose the steak (for a $2 up-charge) and the shrimp alfredo with a side a fries; yea I know, kinda carb-heavy.  All the food tasted great and was up to my expectations.  My only complaint was that the portions were a little light for $19.    Oooook, so I feel like I've pontificated long enough on the ups and downs of Red Lobster.  If you like mid-grade, over-priced, small-portioned seafood, this is the place for you!",

This was to be the third year she choose Red Lobster and we experienced no issues the last few years (which also were over the weekend) calling ahead and letting the restaurant know a large party would be coming and giving them a time. This year we called at 5:30pm to let them know we had a party of 18 and would be arriving at approximately 6:30pm. The young lady who answered the phone said that would be no problem but to call them 30 minutes prior to arrival for them to start preparing tables. I called back at 6pm and a different young lady said they could not seat a party of 18. I explained to her my confusion that we were not told that at 5:30pm and then she said they could seat us but not for at least 2 to 2 1/2 hours. The young lady couldn't explain why I was told something different earlier and was unapologetic. I was very confused and frustrated since we could have made alternate arrangements if were told this 30 minutes prior so I asked to speak with the manager. After a lengthy hold, a lady comes on the phone and says her name is Danielle.  I explained the problem to her and she replies back that they don't take reservations or do call ahead seating. Never does she apologize or offer to see what she could work out to accommodate us and she just came across as annoyed that she was having to take time to speak with me.  By this time I am in my car heading to the restaurant since my guests would be arriving soon since I had been on the phone with the restaurant for some time. I explained my frustration to Danielle and told her I would need her full name, the general manager's name, and their corporate phone number. She said she would need to look up the corporate phone  number and asked if I could hold. I was on hold for over 5 minutes during which the line was picked up 3 different times by young ladies asking if they could help me and I explained each time I was on hold for the manager who was getting me the phone number to corporate. Danielle finally comes back on the line and tells me the number is 1-800-LOBSTER. I really and truly thought for a moment that I was being punked. I mean really, she needed 5 minutes to to know that their number is 1-800-LOBSTER???? I knew then she had been annoyed with me and was just trying to give me a hard time for taking her time. I told her as much and she then said she didn't know the number and she tried to get back on the phone sooner but I wasn't there when she picked up. I had not called back, remained on hold the entire time, and three other ladies picked up on the line just fine while I was on hold which I also explained to her. She then said they had been having phone problems and again, offered zero apologies. I asked when their general manager would be in on Monday and was told he was there and to hold and she would get him. I explained all that had occurred to Jeff, the general manager, who apologized and said he would speak with staff to ensure this didn't happen in the future. It took me almost 20 minutes to arrive to someone who would apologize but never did anyone offer over the phone to see what they could do to make this right. I actually arrived at the restaurant shortly after getting off the phone (call lasted 26 mins) so I could let me guests know what was going on. During the time I was at the restaurant and trying to make alternate arrangements with other nearby restaurants, I asked to speak with Jeff again. I again voiced my total frustration over their mistakes and lack of remorse and my dilemma over what to do. Jeff was of no help other than to again apologize for his employees. We had no issues coming with a large party the last few years and did not have unreasonable expectations over how long it would take to be seated upon arrival (we expected to wait around 30 to 45 upon arrival as we had in previous years when we called ahead). At no point over the phone did anyone offer to break our group apart or see what they could do to seat us.",

    "text": "Tasteless in every sense of the word.    Briefly, I thought about leaving it at that but I figured an explanation for the above statement is warranted.    We had a party of 4 plus two toddlers.  Seated immediately on a Saturday around prime time lunch but that's because the place was practically empty and also because of the \"no one\", our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.    The waitress was cordial at best.  Not friendly.  Also, she hands me my plate and tells me it's \"warm\".  Yeah, not at all warm.  It was uncomfortably hot and I almost dropped it.  But it was only super hot on one side.  Too long under the heat lamp, uh, but just the one side. Not too quick on the drink refills either and we had to be her only table because of the aforementioned \"no one\".   I ordered broiled flounder.  It tasted like a soggy rice cake and it was barely warm.  No taste.  No texture.  The vegetable medley was just ok.  My salad tasted as if it came from one of those pre-mixed salad bags you get at the store.  Granted, it was fresh but it was mainly a bowl of iceburg lettuce, diced unripen tomatoes, one very small slice of purple onion, and diced cucumber.  Uneventful.  All in all, I left feeling hungry and unsatisfied.  Will not be returning to the ol' Red Lobster anytime soon.",

    "text": "I have not been inside a Red Lobster since the days when I used to go with my family as a child back in the late '90s.  Back then I used to think it was such a treat for a Friday night dinner, but as I got older my palette changed and expanded.  Yet, I always retained the fond memories of the seafood smell and pressing my face against the glass tank in order to get a better view of the live lobsters in the lobby.    Since they had their grand opening yesterday for this new location in Matthews, I wanted to try them out for nostalgia's sake, so when my friends asked me to join them I was ready to go.  This new location's decor is part of the Red Lobster's parent company's, Darden Restaurants, new concept for the brand.  Gone is the stodgy look of the past; in its place is a nautical-inspired look that evokes its faux New England marine time heritage.  Despite being busy, we were quickly seated and our waitress was very attentive and accommodating.  I had the typical lobster with vegetables and it also came with pasta and shrimp.  The food was fine, but I felt that there was a little too little of the lobster and a lot more of the shrimp and everything else.  (They lost a star right there.)  The lobster pieces that I could find were pretty decent. The vegetables were cooked evenly and sauteed just right while the pasta was tender and delicious.  It was reasonably priced for a seafood dish containing lobster.  Overall the food was good, but not necessarily outstanding, but good enough to want to go there once in a while.  The Red Lobster feels like a perfect place for families with its kid-friendly menu, and judging from the many children I saw last night it was mostly a family affair.  The Red Lobster makes you think back to when you were a child all over again, but sometimes nostalgia is not enough of a pull to become a regular customer. Finally, I rate this place as a 3.5 stars.",

We then sat and waited for a server to come over and take a drink order. This simply never happened.  While I can't tell you how long it took to be seated or how long it took to decide to leave, I know for a fact that this adventure at Red Lobster took 32 minutes to get back in my car. I will not return to this disaster of a restaurant unless I see a \"new management\" sign indicating that there might be some hope of an improvement.",

What I really want to point out though is the service that we recieved here...it was EXCELLENT. Our server, Jasmine, was absolutely fantastic! Not only was she very pleasant and friendly, but she was so on the ball that I asked to speak to her manager before we left so I could tell him about the superior service that she gave us. Jasmine's timing on bringing everything out was great and I should probably mention here that we got the 4 course special, so timing WAS important. When my husband mentioned that he loved the dip that came with his coconut shrimp, Jasmine brought him out extra. We never once had to ask for refills on our drinks because she had a fresh one waiting for us on our table. After our meal, Jasmine brought out containers appropriate for our leftovers and she also brought a bag, which typically at other places we would have to ask for. It was like she was a mind reader and was so on top of taking care of  everything for us! Oh, and she also had to-go sweet teas for us! This young lady was awesome and made our experience here quite nice!",

The wait wasn't terrible but the server was awful. No refills on the rolls, no follow up on drinks/water, got my drink order wrong, and then fussed at me and said \"well you ordered your strawberry lemonade wrong\"...how??? As she is telling me there are no  free refills on those I let her know that I'm aware and that's fine. It takes 15min to get it and its full of ice. Two swallows and it's gone. So at this point my husband is sucking ice because evidently sprite is at a premium in this place. In my utter foolishness I order another.  No lie it didn't come out until after we received our food and had eaten. I reminded her twice that I wanted another and her response was \" i told you no free refills!\". Ma'am I know just bring me my drink. Finally when we finish paying for everything, including my 2nd drink that I hadnt gotten yet, she brings it out. I asked for a to go cup and it took her so long I had my husband go to the bar to get me a cup himself. We left before she came back. She was inattentive and extremely unprofessional the entire time. Thanks for making my once every 4month date night suck",

Clean facility with great parking. Definitely recommend for your North Carolina visit. Thank you Jeff and staff. Loved the experience.",

Honestly, this is my second time at this red lobster and the service was great before as well.   The food was good. I had fried flounder and fried shrimp with broccoli. It was really good. My coworkers also enjoyed their meal.   Definitely a great experience at this red lobster",

They had also sent a coupon for a free lobster pizza appetizer, which is what inspired our visit. Our waitress was great. She got food and drinks to us quickly and was on top of the reordering process. I had been excited to try the fiesta shrimp, which was fried with queso cheese and pico de gallo, but it was actually my least favorite. The grilled sesame shrimp, shrimp Alfredo, and shrimp scampi were the best options. For $17.95 the endless shrimp is a great deal and worth checking out while it's running.",

We went for lunch Saturday at 12:45pm and were greeted at our table by the friendliest waiter, Darion B, who made sure we were in and out in 45 minutes. Our food came out very quickly, he got all of the details of our order correct, and asked us if we wanted anything boxed or a cup of water to go. Darion is a wonderful server and this Red Lobster is lucky to have him on the team.   I also enjoyed that the manager came by and asked how we were (which was excellent).  Five stars for service. Four stars for food (came out very quickly, good temperature). Lunch portion of crab linguini Alfredo is still very filling; I was plenty full with the salad and could have taken half of the Alfredo to go (which I would have if I was going home).   This is a good Red Lobster with a great location and great service. I recommend it for lunch. Start to finish you can have a filling and quality lunch in 45 minutes. And their lunch menu is available from 11am-3pm every day.",

    "text": "OMGosh! Is this a new fish or have I just been missing it???  The Bar Harbor Lobster Bake.   So I chose to have it with broccoli instead of rice. Initially hesitant, as I usually hear \"white wine, garlic sauce\" and think I will have to add garlic powder to get the flavor that I want, but this sauce was so garlickally (I make my own words when excited),  buttery. The seafood was cooked perfectly. This is my new go-to dish at Red Lobster! My only suggestion, don't slice the scallop to give an appearance of more. I'd rather have less full, juicy scallops than slice them.  Also the bar waitress, Zoe was pleasant, but not overbearing. I worked late last night, was very tired and did not feel my usual need for conversation. She noticed this, checked in on me when needed, but let me enjoy my dinner so that I could get done and get home to rest. She would be a gem for any upscale Charlotte restaurant to have.   Thank you, Zoe! Thank you Red Lobster!!!",

She took our drink orders and in a matter of what felt like seconds she was back with our drinks. We had some questions and she answered them all, very knowledgeable about the menu! We ordered and she continued to check on us for refills and more to see if we wanted more biscuits. The food came out and she came back to check on us and she brought me a few sauces to try with my tacos because I told her I wasn't a fan of ranch. I ordered the lobster tacos and they were good but I think I could have gotten the shrimp or fish for cheaper and still enjoyed them since the salsa and guac overpowered the lobster so I couldn't even really taste it. I did taste it on its own tho and it was good. The grilled shrimp skewers that my coworkers had were really good too. The Shrimp Linguini Alfredo needed some salt and pepper. And of course the cheddar Bay biscuits were amazing!",
