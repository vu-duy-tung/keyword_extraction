    "text": "Oh Co, I was so excited for you to open. We tried to give a good amount of time to work out kinks before trying this new restaurant in waverly. We arrived for dinner on a Friday night and the dining room was full of large parties with tons of children screaming and running around. My friend was actually seated next to one of these parties in a large booth and she told me at one point one of the toddlers was standing on the booth with its pants down. I think the location next to the water play area is not awesome. Additionally, the entrance to the restaurant is awkward, it feels like the main door shouldn't be the main door. We walked up to the hostess and put in our name for an inside table because it was a bit chilly for outside. We waited around 30 minutes and went to check on our table. Miraculously we had chosen the perfect timing and we were seated then. This restaurant was severely under staffed. There were 2 waiters trying to serve the entire dining room AND bussing their own tables. So dirty tables were sitting around because these poor people are so busy. All while there are 2 hostesses whose waiting system is only writing names and phone numbers on a piece of paper.   We are greeted right away but didn't have any time to look at the drink menu. Our waitress is occupied dealing with the complaints of the table sitting next to us. This table actually took out their phone lights when they lowered the lighting around 8 (what the heck people). We finally put in our drink orders and then we are left alone for probably 25-30 minutes without putting in our food order. Finally our cocktails come, my husband got the wrong drink but it tasted good and we weren't about to wait for another. We finally get to put in our food orders, dumplings, ramen, and the Korean bowl. The food came out quickly and it was pretty good. The dumplings didn't taste super fresh, the ramen was good and hubby loved his bowl. The rest of the evening went much more smoothly.  The restaurant needs to adopt a hostess software, hire a busser, have another waiter, and I'm not sure how to deal with rambunctious children taking up seats for hours. I'll probably come back and try again, the ramen really did warm my soul.",

    "text": "Good Food, Terrible Service  I'm currently writing this review as the table next to me left after being neglected for fifteen minutes. As a new restaurant, I can understand a few issues with service as the staff is fairly new, but there's a problem when it's been thirty minutes and your server hasn't returned with your drink. Upon entering the restaurant, there was confusion among the staff with something as simple as getting a table. This isn't a one-time issue, for this is the second time I'm eaten at this location. The first time, my waiter did not know the menu at all and blamed all issues on the newness of this location. The waiters also don't know what food is being delivered to tables, and I also experienced a shortage of forks.   If you are willing to survive horrendous service, the food is definitely worth it. It's a little pricey, but everything from the appetizers to the entrees are amazing. I recommend the com chien, but it's up to you to decide if good food is worth this terrible experience.  Update: Another table left upon hearing that there were no forks when their food arrived after already waiting for an hour, and my waiter tried to take my food while I was still eating.",

My wife had the Korean rice bowl.  It reminded us of food we had on LA.  Our server Anna was attentive and the food came out promptly.  Prices range between $12-15 for many entrees. Very reasonable. We tried the lychee infused sake which was a bit sweet for my taste.  We'll go there again!",

Taste tested the pork sandwich appetizer (don't remember the name), n it was tasty but a bit too sweet for my palate (an over abundance of sauce) n the tough pork was hard to bite cleanly, instead biting in tearing shreds. Ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl which Ahi flavor seemed a bit drowned out by the super sweetness of the whole bowl ingredients n sushi rice. I don't think I'll order it again. Will try something else next time. Sorry but three stars is all I could give this time around.",

The broth is crucial and it was not enough. I can go to a Viet restaurant and every bite of food has meat...the mass ramen my fiance got was wayyyyyyyyyyy too oily.  We dumped half and inch of broth onto a plate. Flavor were average.  Maybe try the sushi next time",

I have already been more than a handful of times and I'm never disappointed. First off the sushi is phenomenal a lot of the rolls are unique and very tasty. The pud thai is definitely something that caught me. Most pud thai dishes have a ketchup base and you can taste that they are very ketchupy so I usually never order it however I stole a little of my sister's and wow was I amazed the flavor is unlike any pud thai I've ever had, absolutely no trace of a ketchup taste. We had the small pork buns and those were to die for. We also ordered the crab rangoon and the flavor was great and they had that satisfying crunch you look for from a fried food. The price is a little higher than other places but you get what you pay for. I will definitely be back for more",

From start to finish I have never seen such a disinterested staff! All of the sodas were flat and continually brought out incorrect beverages. The food was edible only after adding, literally, half a bottle of soy sauce. I spoke to the server who couldn't have cared less and, to my surprise, your manager on duty was equally uninterested. Sadly, the other tables nearby had to get up to help themselves to condiments and drink refills. I have never been so apalled by the behavior and attitude  of a restaurant's staff. With so many fantastic options in the neighborhood, why in the world would you employ a staff who clearly does not care about your guests?!",

The only thing that has been slightly frustrating is we order the Thai boba tea with tapioca and every time we order it, they're always out of tapioca! We've tried to order it different times and different nights and we've only managed to get it once out of 9 different orders! We've gone at such different times and they don't ever seem to have it anymore. If you don't ever have it, I don't know why you put it on the menu or why you can't stock enough of it. We haven't been able to get it that way in over 2 months now. The rest of the food is great though!",

For the main course we had the Curry Laska and the Spicy Udon. The Curry Laska was the exact same Curry as the shrimp Curry, plus some more bland additions. The  Udon noodles were full of onions and scallions barely enough sauce or meats. Since the place is still new, I'm willing to give it another try in a few months.",

Don't deserve a bad experience after a stressful day. Very bad response from the staff at the front desk. The staff at the front desk was different and have encountered someone new this time. The other lady who was waiting for the table along with us, did mention that they might be waiting to pass the Happy hour time. I don't understand, if that's the reason.. they might want to change the happy hour timing instead of being so rude. Obviously, there are other restaurants who would be happy to welcome and serve.",

    "text": "Worst service ever. The first time we were here the hostess was rude and with attitude, wouldn't let us put our name in for a table without giving her a phone number despite us telling her we'd wait for it in the chairs right in front of her. She was also dressed like she had rolled out of bed, got in her car and went to work. Service was ultra slow and no one seemed to care. Showed up last night for dinner and was told there was a 20 minute wait, despite the restaurant being empty (there were 3 tables seated). I asked if that was a joke and they said no, they only had 2 servers, to which I immediately counted 6 people walking around. Wound up waiting closer to 40 minutes for a table despite asking if one was ready about 25 minutes in. My wife and I were served first, then my son and my daughter had to wait at least 10 more minutes for hers! My wife and I ordered the same dish. I like spicy food, but mine was inedibly spicy. My wife's tasted totally different. Other tables were noticeably unhappy with the service with one getting up and having to go find a waiter because no one had come to their table after being seated. This will be our last visit here unless drastic corrective measures are taken. For the foreseeable future, seek other restaurant options in the area... there are plenty.",

Vietnamese Ramen, Poke bowl, pad Thai and pho were ordered and all was delicious with large portions. I love the CO at the Park Road location but the Waverly location was still nice for a girls night or dinner. However I probably won't return until the health score improves.",

The wait staff wasn't bad this visit (I have given this place 2 tries).   They have some good gyoza, but the pho and the summer rolls leave nothing good to say. In fact the summer roll had uncooked noodles that stab you in the mouth and could crack a tooth and the management only takes half off if you have eaten part of something.   Nope waste of time and money.",

CONS: It took 10 mins for us to get a waitress once we sat down. We wanted to order 4 drinks with boba (tapioca) but they were out around 12:30 pm. WHAT?!?!?!?!! All drinks lacked the \"tea\" flavor. Food portions were extremely small, even for appetizers. The gyozas were literally the size of my big toe! 4 pieces for $5!!!!!!!!!! COME ON!!!!! We had the pho (okay) and fried rice with chinese sausage & shrimp (no flavor).  I was very disappointed since it seemed that this establishment would have their flavors on point to match the expensive menu.   I will stick to the korean restaurant/honey buns at SUPER G MART on Independence for the korean food, noodles, and milk tea with boba. Plus, their customer service is so much faster for half the price.   RECOMMENDATION: train the staff to hustle much more efficiently and get the flavors to a level of authenticity.",

Regardless, the taste and textures were pleasing and I would most definitely order again.   The Curry Laksa was insanely good. So much that I could have possibly inhaled it a few times.

When I went to pick up the food, I went to the main check in (which is where I always pick up food) and the host was extremely rude and told me to go to the bar and check there. I went over to pick up my food, which looked a little off. The bartender assured me it was fine.  The dish tasted fine so I did not think anything of it.  I ended up with severe food poisoning and have been in bed for 2 days now.

Awful service and pretty rude manager.  Don't go there and expect a good service.  Restaurant needs good management and good service folks, this is Waverly and people expect service.

Seats do not rotate and because  crammed so tightly in the small space that you have to pull it fully out into path of kitchen traffic and other waiting patrons. Worst part was the wait once you ordered. Once we flagged down someone asking about our order they appeared to remember at least part of our table - they brought out two dinners leaving the other half of table without food for another 10 minutes. Then brought out the third diner's food. I was the very last person to get my food after waiting another five minutes and I had raw sushi. Table next to ours experienced same thing. Food was ok but not fantastic. Noodles undercooked for the other folks in our party. Could tell my sushi roll had been sitting out for awhile. Manger brought my roll out apologizing giving us free desserts  which we did not get. This visit was for a friend's birthday. Overall not worth the wait and just frustrating and embarrassing experience for us who chose to take her there to celebrate said birthday. Hope for their sake they get it together.",

We had a party of 7 so expected a few delays but not to this caliber. We had to ask for table settings, silver and glasses of water. When we were finally served water, it was in styrofoam because they ran out of water cups and they didn't have ice in those cups. Appetizers arrived but had no flatware to eat them with so they were eaten cold. We literally waited 2 hours after ordering but to no avail. We were trying to be patient and not ruin a Friday night with friends. When we finally spoke to a manager, she told us that our meal was going to be given priority but then 2 of our party weren't served. Because no one was attending us, we tried to get the manager again, then had to go back to the bar area to find someone in charge. The owner literally told me to \"go somewhere else if we didn't like it there.\" Well, that's what we'll do. I can take incompetence and chalk it up to new beginnings but I will not tolerate downright disrespectful and rude behavior, especially from the owner of the restaurant.

Not sure if they take reservations, but we didn't have one.  There was a 20 minute wait- no biggie- we went to the bar and had a drink.  Service at the bar was good!  Within the 20 minute time frame we were seated.  All good so far:) . We started with another round of drinks and they gyoza.  Everything came out promptly and was delicious!  From here is when things went south.  We ordered another order of gyoza and after waiting about 15-20 minutes with no order showing up, our waiter says they are now out of the gyoza.  Really?  At that point we ordered another drink another appetizer to replace the gyoza that they were out of.  After about 15 minutes the appetizer comes out, but no drinks.  We flag our waiter down and he says he is working on getting our drinks out.  Another 20 minutes later, our food comes out, but still no drinks.  We are halfway through our dinner and I decide to go inside myself, go to the bar and see what the holdup was.  No really good explanation other than they were out of the wine we wanted.  Huh?  That seemed to do the trick and I was promptly served the drinks we ordered 45 minutes prior.  I don't know if it was just an inexperienced waiter who was over his head or the restaurant wasn't prepared for the crowd, but they need to get it together.  The food was really good though and I would give that a solid 4.5.  Service, not so much.",

The service was really slow and the waitstaff was so apathetic it was almost hostile.  The food was not the quality we expected either. And the cleanliness level of the floor to the seats to the table was more like a dishwasher room than a dining room. This whole front of house felt very put out and back of house. It was almost as gross as a backwater fishcamp buffet.",

To start we had tuna tacos and they were so good! I didn't even really taste the tuna because the aioli was great. I ordered chicken and shrimp pad thai and hubby ordered a firecracker roll per the server's suggestion. I had a piece and it wasn't bad {says a lot being that I'm not the kind of person who would order sushi for my own plate}. The pad thai was DELICIOUS and such a great portion. I also loved that they didn't make you choose between chicken and shrimp and gave you both. It was enough for me and to share with hubby since he was still a bit hungry. Would definitely come back again!",

The hostess was pretty nice when I walked in. My food was ready on time which was nice . However, for Waverly to have been so busy there weren't a whole lot of people there . Maybe a slow night ? Idk. Definitely a cute place. Seems great for a date night or a night out with friends . Love the art on the walls. Very modern ambiance.   Anyways, on to the food . The dumplings are amazing ! Super flavorful and while I felt that they could've had a little more Kimchi flavor in them, I still loved them . The wontons were a little on the small side, but again were a tasty treat to cap off a meal. Will definitely be ordering both again. The reason I give this place a 4/5 is mainly due to the Pho. The broth to me wasn't seasoned enough in comparison to some other Phos I've had . Was it bad? No. Great? Also no. I had to add quite a few things to give it a flavor . Once I did tho it turned out pretty good. At $14 I was just expecting a little more. Maybe it just wasn't a great batch? I'm down to try another bowl and see.  Overall, I really enjoyed my first experience with Co. I'll definitely be back to give the dine in experience a try.",

    "text": "Despite absolutely loving the CO in Charleston, the Waverly CO has disappointed me 3x in a row. The service has been consistently terrible and the food orders incorrect.   When seated outside at a patio table, the server was rarely seen. But I thought it would be different inside. No. First, the hostess gave a 45 min wait time. Next the bartender was so overwhelmed (she was the only one on a very busy Saturday night), it took 20 min to get drinks. While waiting and then sipping our drinks, we noticed that one bar table for 4, one patio table for 4, and 3-4 inside tables were all empty. Consistently. So the entire hour we waited, there were multiple empty tables. That means that seating isn't happening efficiently (despite two hostesses who did not appear to be overworked).  After waiting for 55 minutes, we checked with the hostess, who let us know - SURPRISE! - our table was being cleaned and almost ready. We told her we were in the bar, and after 5 more minutes, we once again checked back with her. She then pointed to our empty table. It would have been GREAT if she had either told us to come wait at the hostess stand until our table was ready or come to get us in the bar.   Once seated, we realized the server was overwhelmed too because she was overtly unpleasant. We ordered drinks, water and appetizers as soon as she came by. Our waters hadn't arrived 30 min later. When we asked her for waters, she said \"you're going to have to give me a few minutes.\"  Unsurprisingly, at this point, the food arrived incorrect. An order for edamame gyoza was delivered as edamame spring rolls. One drink was wrong. And one noodle dish was super dry but the server didn't come around often enough to ask for a sauce or something to help it.   Terrible experiences. I wanted to love it as I'm enjoying the new Waverly area, but I'm going to pass from now on. There are too many other competing restaurants to continue the disappointment here.   Food review: -Malaysian chili wings are ok -Curry laksa is good but the no-chicken order had chicken in it -edamame spring rolls are incredibly greasy  -fried pork belly bun is greasy but tasty with the house hot sauce -no amount of hot sauce can fix the dry tasteless tofu banh mi -Hanoi noodles were dry.  -Bombay chai tea is just a packet of Tazo chai. Ok, but this is what I drink at home for 15 cents a packet  **On a positive note, the fried vegetarian sushi (crispy veg roll) is really good.",

The chairs were so small we all felt like we were sitting in kid sized chairs. My husband and I ordered the pork belly buns and the waitress informed us there were only two per order and asked if we wanted two orders which I replied no were good. She rushed off and completely ignored our friend who wanted to order dumplings. We ended up receiving two orders of pork belly buns which we just ate and they were delicious. For our meals we got multiple sushi rolls which were loved, especially the waygu. I got the Vietnamese ramen and the pulled pork in it was delicious and even better than the pork belly in it. At the end of the meal our server brought over our check, all on one, without even asking at which point we had to track her down to eventually get her to split it. Overall, service was mediocre and food was delicious!",

It was tough to tell if she was talking to us or to a customer on the phone. They took our number and quoted us our wait time.  We went ahead and walked around outside for a little until we received a call that our table was ready - quicker than we were quoted.   When we sat down, we were given the chance to order our drinks. We got a water and a lychee iced tea. He water was great. The tea tasted amazing - however - it was only about 5 sips and it was gone. The glass was mostly ice. At $3 for a drink like this, you'd assume it would come with refills... Unfortunately, that was not the case.   Overall throughout the meal, there was a theme of things being under seasoned.  If it weren't for the hot sauce provided, everything would have been really bland.   We ordered the pork belly buns and the spring rolls as an appetizer. There were two pork belly buns and 2 spring rolls cut in half. They were ok. I've certainly had much better at other restaurants and made at home.  For our meals, I had the masa ramen and my girlfriend had the Pad Thai.  Again, both under seasoned.  This is the first time I have seen corn in ramen, and it didn't quite jive for me. The garlic they added was over cooked, so it gave off that burnt garlic fragrance and a bitterness throughout the dish.  The noodles seem to be instant ramen noodles that they've used - far from the quality of ramen you can get at other places around town.   Overall, I likely won't find myself coming back to this restaurant.",

Some of the best menu items are the Malaysian chili wings, the kimchi dumplings  (which admittedly don't have a strong enough Kimchi flavor, but are still delicious), the spicy crab rangoon, the curry laksa noodles, and the spicy beef pho. All yummy! The rolls that I've had have been good, too. Also, try the jalapeno mojito! It's insanely good. It's a reason to go to Co all on its own! The dark and peach is also delicious. The servers have been very friendly the times I've eaten in, although we usually get take out. The one criticism I have, is that when you order hot food and sushi for takeout, they package the sushi in the same bag as the hot food. So unless you like hot, questionable sushi, either don't get sushi to go, or ask them to put it in its own bag!",

When I arrived, I really liked that the restaurant was adjacent to the play area. It was a little different entering the restaurant though, the front entrance door was on the patio so I was a little confused. Walking I immediately began looking for my friend because she mentioned she had just arrived at the restaurant. When I didn't see her I walked to the host desk to see if she may have made a reservation. The host wasn't friendly at all with assisting with my table as my friend had not exactly arrived. Then I immediately noticed the horrible food score 92.0 and the date on the scorecard was April 25, 2018. If this was a new restaurant, that's not good at all!  We walked over to the available table and I began snapping photos and checking out the space. Then when my friend called, we realized she was at the Park Road location and I was at the Providence location. I was honestly releaved and willing to make the drive to join her at that location. I don't think I could have truly stomached the 92.0 food score, a few of the reviews I read beam to be True about this location. If you would like to try CO i would suggest the Park Road location it wa great and the amazing bar tree is beautiful.",

The Vietnamese ramen ($14) is amazing and they are one of the only ramen restaurants that I've tried that allow for meat substitution!

We also went in with a group of 6 and everyone agreed that the atmosphere, food, and drinks are all fantastic!    Over the course of a few visits, I've tried the Pork Belly Bun, Garlic Sesame Tuna Taco, Chicken Katsu Bahn Mi, Pork Belly Bahn Mi, Drunken Noodles, Spicy Pulled Pork Tacos, and a few of their drinks. I've tried a few of their cocktails, but I keep going back to Aperol Goldeneye....it's Pinapple(y) Goodness that shouldn't be missed!    Sadly, there are a few consistencies that are forcing me to give 4 stars instead of 5. The Chicken Katsu is always overcooked and dry as a bone!  They use WAAAAAAYYYYY too much Cilantro...even for this Cilantro lover!  The servers need some serious retraining on how to deliver and collect plates from tables. Every server that we've had so far has been super friendly, but why do they insist on serving over people's heads and pass plates in front of one person to get to another?  Seriously?!?  I just don't get it and other people have noticed the service issue during their visits, too.",

    "text": "It was pretty good, but not completely Authentic. I know it's a fusion restaurant, so I expected it to be a bit Americanized. For a starter, we got the crab Rangoon and it was absolutely delicious!! Spicier than I expected. We got dumpling as well, and my stomach did not like those. I got chicken pho and my husband got the Korean beef bowl, and they both were good portions and had delicious aromas. My husband's bowl was good, but just a little bit too salty (I think it was the rice). My pho was okay. It had only three strips of chicken, so that really disappointed me. And it lacked flavors and almost seemed kinda bland. Also, this is not really a big deal but they don't have plastic chop sticks, only wood ones! It was weird eating with wood chopsticks and they got all soggy....  the atmosphere was cool and relaxed and our service was very attentive. 5 stars on that part. All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. I don't care if I go here again.",

Their curry laksa is the best thing hands down on the menu; however, the com chien, drunken noodles, pho, ramen, curry shrimp, Malaysian wings (marinated in coconut milk), sushi offerings, spicy pork tacos, dumplings, and many others are all hard for us to choose from.  The ownership and staff are always welcoming to us and make us feel at home.  Also a great location if you have little ones for the play area outside.  Our 5 year old says that this is his favorite place and we go about 3 times a week.",

We arrived at 11:15 for lunch with only one other group there.  My wife and I waited 10 minutes for drinks and it never improved from there.  Even when the Server noted my drink was empty and she would be right back with a refill, it took 15 minutes and I was already done with my meal.  The steamed pork buns had good flavor but the pork was over cooked and tough.  My wife's pho was ok.  My pork belly bahn mi was terrible.  There was so little meat or veggies inside every bite was basically bread.  I eat bahn mi and/or pho several times a week at two other restaurants in Charlotte and this was beyond crazy.  At $9.50 the sandwich should be at least ok, this was the worst bahn mi I have ever had.  The pictures show how little was inside.  One \"half\" had one bite of meat and the other half had little more.  There was more meat in the appetizer steamed buns than in the bahn mi.  I hope Co does other dishes well and bahn mi is just a menu filler.  Again, my wife said the beef pho was fine so there may be hope.    For me, even living only 5 minutes away is not enough for me to return.  Poor service and terrible food was enough of a first impression for me.",

We waited a while for a server. A guy came up to us and talked to us, took our appetizer order but told us our server should be with us soon. We waited about 20 mins, the assistant manager came and talked to us. We waited a little more, never got a server but other tables next to us were getting service. The assistant manager came back again and we had to ask him if we can place our order with him. Never got our appetizer that we put in with the other guy until our food came out. My boyfriend's ramen was cold. The couple that came maybe 20-30mins after us got their food the same time we got ours. So unnecessary to be waiting so long for our food. We stayed because i really wanted to try it. The assistant manager gave us 50% off but it looked like he was laughing to one of the servers once he went back inside.

I had to greet the bartender and ask her how she was doing. Her response, \"I'm good.\" Nothing back. She handed us menus and I let her know that we were hoping to order take-out. She walked away and my boyfriend and I were left waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Due to the rude bartender, we made the decision to leave. We ventured to another restaurant in the area for take out and cocktails. The experience was very disappointing.

The drinks were full of flavor the dark and peach being at the top of the list. I started with the spicy crab rangoon  moved to the Kung fu crunch roll and then moved to the Thai curry shrimp. I must say the spices in all of the dishes were spot on. It was the right amount of kick that kept you wanting more. I am still drooling over the spicy crab rangoon and can't wait to return for more.

    "text": "All sorts of Asian foods (and mixed experiences)  Okay so I'm very conflicted on this place. The menu covers Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai, and even a bit of Korean. For those looking to try or get introduced to a variety of different foods from different Asian cultures I could recommend this place.  However, the taste of the food is also just as diverse. Out of the 4 dishes we ordered, 2 were surprisingly fantastic and 2 were pretty terrible.  +The Crab Rangoon ($5) - Flavorful, well sized, just crispy and sauced enough. It was delightfully portioned and pretty darn good.  +++The Masa Ramen ($14) - Holy cow! I go out of my way to eat ramen in every city I visit. I was not expecting to find such a good, clean, and well-balanced ramen here. It comes with a good portion of noodles and corn and the pork belly (which is dry in the buns) was actually very moist and delicious. Usually I go to Futo Buta for my ramen cravings when I'm in Charlotte but I may start coming here once in a while.   -Curry Shrimp ($8) - Shrimp tastes low quality, curry was subpar, and the bread (which was extra buttery) seemed to be doing its own thing.  -Pork Belly Buns ($6) - The most depressing looking (and possibly tasting) pork buns I've ever had. The buns felt like plastic and there were hardly any vegetables to add substance or balance to the bun.  Taste: 3.3/5 (4.5 for the first two and 2 for the last two) Atmosphere: 4/5 (The centerpiece here is super cool) Value: 3.5/5",

My only criticism is that the noise level was off the chart.  Conversations with anyone, including the server, had to be conducted via shouting.  My next visit was for lunch and I tried the Vietnamese soup with chicken.  The soup was outstanding but the chicken did not seem to be as fresh as it could have been. My server was not as attentive as he should have been but another lady filled in admirably.  The noise level this trip was very pleasant and I found it very easy to have a conversation.  The prices are very reasonable and the facility is clean.  Management staff is attentive and friendly.  I look forward to my next visit!",

Co is an Asian fusion place, and has your typical Chinese, Japanese, Thai, etc. offerings.  I opted to try something different and go for the Vietnamese ramen. It tasted to me like pho broth with ramen ingredients. Pretty much what I expected.  My girlfriend had the drunken Thai noodles. Noodles were slightly undercooked and the chicken was overcooked.  The prices are just too high for the kind of food they're serving. Honestly we had a pretty mediocre experience, and Co does nothing to stand out from other Asian fusion restaurants.",

I would not call this place \"kid-friendly\" - not that the staff was bad with them or that there was glass everywhere or anything. It was just not...well...kid-friendly in the traditional sense. The food was a bit much for your average kid and the prices were not really either. But, that was my fault for not researching it before I came.   The food my wife and I ate was good, certainly high quality. The atmosphere was open, average noise, light. The chairs were not that comfortable to sit in. It wasn't very crowded but we didn't get very attentive service (although our female server was very friendly and funny). The prices were a bit much for the food portions, IMO.   But, overall, the issue - if you want to call it that - was that Co. was very...forgettable. Nothing really stood out. Kind of blah all around. Nothing wrong with it, just did not excel in any aspect. Will I come back? Probably not...but if I was in the area and wanted Asian food...maybe.",

The rice took over 20 minutes to come out . When it did I had to send it back because all of the TOFU was carcinogenic! Not to mention we got the Thai Green curry came out before everything and we ordered it 15 minutes after everything.  Now the icing on the cake was when I got the food and got to the bottom of my bowl to realize the was a small brown hair . Completely disgusted. This is the third time I've seen this happen here ... never to me but overhearing other people . I guess the manager a very unpleasant and sleezily dressed Asian woman SOO , saw me take a picture of the food and the assistant manager to ask me not to return to the restaurant. Someone call the health inspector if this is how they do business. GO TO YAMA wayyy better food , better staff , and better health rating!",

We were very nervous because we got sat 5 minutes before happy hour was over. Thank goodness our waitress was very nice, helpful and fast. We got our orders put in before it ended. There is also a small sheet for appetizers that are also half price I believe that you can order during this time as well. We got several items including the bao bun, tuna tacos, tuna tataki, dumplings,  katsu chicken slider, warty roll, super crunch roll, lemon salmon roll, Kobe beef roll, rainbow roll etc.  I didn't really enjoy the super crunch roll because it was laid in a red sauce in a bowl that tasted like hot sauce to me and I just didn't think it mixed well with that roll. Hot sauce on my raw fish just isn't my thing. Either the pork belly roll or the Kobe roll also had a sauce I didn't really care for. The Wagyu I was disappointed with because for being cooked it was very chewy and upon asking I was informed that it was not Japanese Wagyu but American Wagyu.  Overall though I had a good experience and left satisfied. We got to look at the menu beforehand so when we got sat we ordered everything we wanted. There is no limit to how much you can order at a time. We were also able to bring home our last roll free of charge. I'm not really sure how she explained it worked but ask before you order and assume.",

    "text": "Went to lunch today and we were the only ones in there.  This is the second time we have tried it and we are even less impressed than the first one.  Family in Dilworth rave about the Co nearby, so we decided to try again.  We ordered the pork and crab spring rolls - so brown and crispy they were almost burned and had absolutely no taste.  The spicy crab rangoon was very good.  I ordered the drunken noodles and they were very salty, bland and so dry they were gummy.  My husband ordered the Thai Green Curry and it looked beautiful with grilled veggies over rice, but was also very salty and not very tasty.  After a few bitres we asked for our check. Yama, around the corner, is always excellent.  Vietnam Grille on South Blvd. is also great, but we won't be going back to CO.",

Our waiter did an adequate job but could have checked in more (there was not a lot of people) and I probably would have bought another beer. We will try it again but don't recommend right now.",

    "text": "I didn't realize there was a second branch of CO, so I had to go and check it out! This was much smaller, and less fancier than the original location, but had much more comfy seating arrangements (less high tops as in the other location). I walked in rather early (11 amish?), so had first dibs on seats and service...both of which proved to be excellent! I ordered the Curry Laksa again, and it's so obvious why this is their signature dish! It's just all-out yummy!! The flavor of the broth is just heavenly, and comes with a ton of fresh greens. I must complain however...that it did not include any shrimp, but I was charged the same amount. Normally, this would tick me off enough to drop a star or two...not to mention me doing some griping to the waitress. However, I decided not to make a fuss, given how amazing good this was (again)...with or without the shrimp. Not sure if maybe this particular location didn't include the shrimp or what, but if this happens again, I WILL ask about this on my next visit.  Anyway, so glad to know that there's this second location, closer to home for me!",

The food was tasty and well prepared....but the service was lackluster, food debris on floor and seat on the red banquette seat and dirty dishes left on table. Sanitation rating was 93, concerning in a sushi restaurant.  Every time the door opened we would get a blast if icy cold air.  The design of the entrance door is mid seating area and the hostess station is off in the corner.  This place badly needs some kind of sally port to separate the entrance from the dining area and the hostess station needs to be near the door... who designed this?  Park  Road is so efficient and beautiful this looks like you enter the restaurant by a side door",

We had assorted apps and my favorite Pad Thai.   The place has some really cool design features...I love the wood ceiling and antiqued mirrors inside.

I was expecting the normal \"sure\", but who knows and servers/restaurants typically don't care or they just avoid things like soy sauce and don't check the actual ingredients.  Not here!! The server spoke to the chef and he came out and went through all the ingredients that had it and told me what he was going to do instead to make sure I liked it.  Wow! I was blown away that they took it seriously and took the time to come out and explain it to me (and it was busy).  Then..  I'm that girl.. I hit my glass and it shattered everywhere.

Our server \"Tori D. \" was 99.9% the factor. In this review. In our experience, especially with a grand opening of any restaurant, the food can be the best ever but it's the 'growing pains' that can have a negative effect on a business. Tori's hard work and excellent job combined with the explosion of flavor in the food what won us over. We had the beer & kimchi dumplings the edamame gyoza the Korean rice bowl and the super crunch roll. Dumplings were amazing and gyoza id give an A-. Great flavor and broth on gyoza was to die for. The rice bowl had the sunny side up egg and spicy kimchi so people looking for this will absolutely love it. Super crunch roll was something I could eat every day. Wow. Great food and a wait staff like her will bring us back! Favorite item - \"Super Crunch\" roll.",

    "text": "Had high hopes for this place.  Went on Friday 10/6.  Seemed totally chaotic from the moment we walked in, but no problem, it's a new restaurant.  After waiting 45 minutes for a table and seeing other seated ahead of us who came in after us, again no problem, we were at the bar.  Drinks were OK.  The beer tap lines were new, so the beer had an off taste.  At least the bartender recommended getting bottled beer instead.  Mixed drinks were premixed in large containers.  With the number of places serving fresh made cocktails, found this a bit weird for the prices of the drinks, but understand the reason for it.  Wines OK and they pour into a small carafe to measure which is good (even though at the table someone ordered wine and it came back at about half the pour.  It was sent back since another person got the correct pour.  Not sure if someone was trying to rip us off or just made a mistake).  Then after being seated, wow, getting drinks near impossible, getting a real napkin or silverware, impossible.  Served water in styrofoam cups, are you kidding me.   Appetizers came, but without utensils and plates the food got cold.  At this point we were laughing.  We even joked about ordering a Papa John's pizza for delivery, but who would of thought we really could have.  Tried talking to the waiters or managers.  Nothing.  Then half our food came out, but not the rest and we seek out the manager again and the owner.  By asking where our food was for a third time, the owner tells us we are out of line and should just take our business elsewhere.  It's not so funny any more when they start insulting the customer.  Terrible service.  The manager and owner are both extremely rude.  Food we received was OK, but way too many restaurants serving similar food in Charlotte.  We will never eat here again and will never go to an establishment with the same owner.  Just awful, Waverly and South Charlotte deserve much better than this place.  Had issues at Ted's Montana Grill next door a couple of times and its great manager handled it perfectly with class and respect.  Not so, here, give your dollars elsewhere.",

Service has been consistently poor, but has trended upward - it was horrible at first. In a nutshell, the food was good enough that we came back hoping the service would improve - it doesn't seem to be the servers themselves - the problem seems to be that the restaurant is consistently understaffed. Expect long waits for seating, service, and food, even if it doesn't appear  busy.   One huge plus for the service - a waitress gave my group a detailed explanation regarding potential traces of shellfish across their menu. As someone with an allergy, it was really refreshing to see someone treat it seriously.   Update: went back due to the managers response to this review. It was our worst experience yet :/",

Food however was awesome.  Pork belly buns, tuna tacos, firecracker roll and edamame were excellent.  Wish we had tried the Coconut curry",

Would definitely recommend and will be going back!",

    "text": "The food here is great. However the service is terrible. If you want a great Asian fusion restaurant, go to Co, but definitely not this location. Opt for the Park Rd location instead. Last night at Co I can identify singularly as one of my worst dining experiences I've ever had period. Like I said the food and drinks are great, but the service is frankly insufficient. Nobody gave us menus when we sat down, we had to ask for them. After asking for our menus we waited 20 minutes before we asked if we could order drinks, another 20 minutes before again, WE asked if we could order food. Food took about 30 minutes to prepare. However, they were very busy so I'll be forgiving in regards to that.   While sitting at the bar I noticed that the jar of blackberries had mold growing in it, which working in the fine restaurant business before I realize can happen. Sometimes you get a shipment in that already has something growing in it maybe at the bottom where you don't see it. I alerted the bartender/waitress that there was mold growing in the jar, and that I wasn't grossed out but others might be. She actually ignored me the first time I said it, and after alerting her again she made zero eye contact with me and just removed the jar from the top of the bar to behind the bar on the shelf. Never once thanking me for catching that or even apologizing for that.   I like this place's food so I wish that they would do well. But if they don't improve in their service especially on our side of town, they unfortunately won't do well. People talk and right know nobody's saying good things about this Co location. (Park Rd rocks)",

I like al dente but these were just barely blanched.  Manager was rude.  Oops did I repeat that?  Good: Hostess and server were great.  Flavor of most of the dishes and dipping sauces were fantastic.  Prices were very reasonable.  I won't be back because of the manager on duty Friday night.  He was so rude to us but over the top friendly to other diners around us.   I guess he didn't like us?",

I haven't come when they were super busy but the service is prompt and the food always comes out hot and fresh. The menu is extensive enough to make choosing difficult but in a good way. Everything sounds amazing. I say sounds since I tend to stick to the Ahi Poke (my original reason for hitting it up) and their crab wontons are the best I've ever had. I also really appreciate the music they play, especially since I'm usually alone. I even heard a Miniature Tigers song once! Maybe next time I can talk myself into trying something new since I'm convinced anything I ordered would be fantastic. I've been a handful of times and have no complaints whatsoever. Highly recommend.",

My adult son has a peanut & tree nut allergy, and we didn't notice the little red peanut symbol next to the Spicy Beef Pho he ordered. He had an allergic reaction about 30 minutes after we left, and we had to dose him up with Benadryl. Thankfully, he's fine, but we had NO IDEA that anything he ingested had peanuts in it. I do wish the menu was more blatant about things that contain peanuts -- it was not listed in the description of the item, just had a little red peanut symbol next to it. Our server was lackluster, but the person who brought us our food was great. I will definitely go back but will watch the menu more carefully.",
