We ordered the 1/4 chicken dark and it included 2 pieces dark chicken, tiny cole slaw, roll, couple hush puppies, and fries. You definitely get your money's worth. The pieces are way too small. The chicken is crunchy and has a nice taste, but it's not anywhere close to fried chicken I've gotten elsewhere. I've eaten better chicken at the gas station on Providence Road in Ballantyne and delicious chicken at the Cajun Yard Dog at the Arboretum! The fries are good, tho. They stayed nice and crunchy on the way home. Cole slaw pretty good. Potato salad would've been better had they not put so much seasoning in it, house seasoning, I presume. Service quick and friendly, tho. Seriously, my fried chicken is better than this place.. Yo, I should've known when I saw that white people ran it. Damn, I wanted this place to be as great as they say. But sadly, it ain't no thang but a chicken wang.",

    "text": "3 stars for the food, 4 stars for the price  I stopped by for a quick lunch to-go around 11:30am and it was pretty crowded, but service is speedy with multiple cashiers. It's carry out only and cash only.   I got the dark sandwich special which is a fried chicken drumstick and thigh between a plain roll with coleslaw or potato salad on the side. I'm not quite sure how to eat this as a sandwich (since the bones are still in the chicken) so I sort of ate it separately. The potato salad wasn't good, so maybe I'll try to coleslaw next time. The fried chicken was great: crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It's well salted so no need to add extra and it goes well with the bread. Condiments/sauces cost extra (besides salt) so if you want some additional flavor to your meal, don't forget to ask for some.   Finally, service--besides being fast--is friendly. It made my food purchasing-experience a lot more enjoyable. At $3.26 (tax included) a lunch, I think it's a great deal.",

    "text": "Fried Chicken; in every city, there is a place that cooks it with the idea, that it should be a great value, and it should hold up, even when packed in a \"to-go\" container.   This is such a place, in fact, it's only a takeout place, so don't bother planning an evening there, unless you like sitting on the sidewalk or dangling out of your car.   I mean, the friend chicken here is good.  The drumstick is juicy, meat is tender, and the same can be said about the thigh also.  The batter coats it just right; no heavy glops of batter, when you bite in, you feel the skin giving way, to the decedent meat underneath.  The flavor is always present, the idea that it's a hug from the inside out, you get.  Sure there is a lot of great Fried Chicken places around Charlotte, but this one is the simple, working man's delight.  If you get the dinners, you also get Cole Slaw, Tater Rounds, Hush Puppies, and a nice roll. It's a perfect portion, you aren't going to be asking for me, for at least an hour, but you aren't going to be in a coma either.  Their sweet tea is the Maxwell House stuff, which is basically the base for most sweet teas, what you might expect to have been served by family or in my case, southern born friends. Yes I said it, maybe your parents served Lipton, but this tastes just about right in my mine.   If you can get there before the rush, you might see the front of house, without trouble, but with orders made in minutes, you are assured, even if you take a few extra moments, you are still going to be rewarded with yummy food, that will make you happy, and smiling.   Go here, lots of street parking, just off the beaten path, they close at 6pm, so beware.",

    "text": "PRICE'S CHICKEN COOP I have to admit: I am a sucker for fried chicken. Since I'm in North Carolina to visit (future) family, eat as the Southerners do. As we drove through downtown Charlotte, I noticed a long line of people spilling out of Price's Chicken Coop and decided to give it a try. The waiting room was packed with African-Americans and Rednecks! This had to be one good fried chicken joint! As I was waiting in line, there was a Redneck who looked like he could pass as GLEE's Beck Jackson's brother talking to himself how \"damn good\" the fried chicken was here at Cooper's. When I told him I was from CA, he immediately said that KFC sucks and that the Chicken Coop made absolutely the best fried chicken ever because of their secret sauce; that was why he's come here already over two-dozen times!!! This man here is a True fan!  We ordered the whole dark meat chicken (4 drumsticks & 4 thighs), and the fish sandwich with tartar sauce. The sandwich was OK - nothing special... but the chicken... now, that was something!! Admittedly, it tasted similar to KFC's classic fried chicken, but less greasy and fried. Super tasty, although a bit too salty... but then again, it's fried chicken! If you're into fried chicken, this is the place for you, evidenced by the endless line!  Ordering was quick. Food tasted great!. Drawback: it's a take-out place only, so there's nowhere to sit and eat greasy fried chicken, which can be quite messy. Most people eat in their car. Otherwise, this place was the bomb! Drink lots of water, though, because the salt will make you very thirsty. This Californian certainly enjoyed this North Carolina classic and will definitely come back for more next time!",

Ordering was a little confusing but they quickly take your order, give you your drink, it's cash only, and deliver your order in a card board box with everything you need. It was busy at about 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon and they have a ton of staff working to take care of the crowd. I had potato salad and the slaw---they were ok. Mayo based and I prefer vinegar based. No biggie, I wasn't there for the sides. Hush puppies where great. I did get a 1/2 chicken both white and dark meat. It was delish and I think anyone in Charlotte has got to go at least once.  The only thing missing is somewhere to sit, although I wouldn't want to sit inside as anyone sitting inside for an extended amount of time would come out smelling like they were frying the chicken.",

Since fried chicken's home is in the The South, that means it's the best fried chicken in the country and by default the world. So damn. Unassuming Price's Chicken Coop, in my boyfriend's hometown, the best in the world? And why havent we gone here yet? Seriously it seems like we never got the chance while in town. But this year FINALLY, we tried it.  3 hungry guys and I .. open saturday afternoon.. there. Pulled up to the line coming out the door. I knew there was no seating but was still thought it funny to see all kinds of people outside on the sidewalk, across the street on the grass next to train tracks, in cars just chowing down. They couldn't wait. More good signs. And although the line was long we were literally in and out with 4 mixed piece dinners in 10 minutes. extra 5 cents for some Texas Pete hot sauce packets no prob. With my first Cheerwine in hand, we made our way to the steps of the builoding next door. Hush puppies .. best ever we all agreed, little tater tots .. bonus.. soft roll .. for me unnecessary so I passed it down, cole slaw was forgettable but cut through all the friedness, but the chicken was the best I ever had on par with my late great-grandmother's. One person in the group disagreed because he favors Dion's in the Keys (but he only eats it when he's drunk :-) sooo .. juicy & perfectly seasoned and a HUGE portion. Best Ever. Will stop by every time I pass through Charlotte for sure.   OH & CASH ONLY!!",

    "text": "So, after hearing all the hype about this heaven sent fried chicken, I decided to finally bite the fried bullet and go check out the coop. After walking in and trying to elbow my way into one of the 5 so called lines, I grabbed my 1/4 dark with hush pups and hit the road. Overall, I think nostalgia is what keeps this place going, because the chicken is just okay....nothing better than if you know how to soak a bird in some buttermilk, dredge in seasoned flour and fry. Hush pups were a bit dense and bland...needed some onion bits or something. Anyways, been there and done that, and must say Church's is better.",

It fits perfectly well into the Southend scene and offers locals and out-of-towners an equally god experience. The place is packed by 11am and does not slow down until it closes or the food runs out for the day. They only take cash, so make sure you check the wallet before hand and don't be scared off by the people standing around the sidewalk as it's normal. You'll order quick, get your food quick and be expected to leave quick so the next person in line can get their order on. They have fried chicken and fish...for me, chicken all day long. Add some hush puppies and slaw and it's a good day. Go see for yourself!",

You can smell the aroma of the chicken all the way from the Bland St. light rail stop. I tried a 1/4 dark dinner and a dark sandwich and I really think the sandwich is the way to go. The higher price for a 1/4 dark meal is on account of the addition of tater tots and a couple hush puppies and the substitution of a roll for a sandwich bun. The roll and the tater tots while good are not particularly noteworthy and make for an awfully heavy meal. The dark sandwich (2 pc. chicken, cole slaw or potato salad, and a bun) is a perfect size for an average lunch and won't leave you with a food coma. It's cheap too coming in at $3.26.",

Just don't screw around and cut in line and you will be fine. I always get the half chicken white or dark (comes with hush puppies - so good and tater tots). It also comes with a side like coleslaw which I swap out for the potato salad. The coleslaw has a weird after taste or something. Get the fried apple pie too near the register - yum!",

Better than the gas station fried chicken that everyone talks about. Website shows only quarter chicken dinners but the menu on site has half dark chicken meals too. I would suggest to share one chicken dinner with 2 people since it comes with plenty of sides. Out of all the sides, the fries and potato salad are my favorite. The 1/4 chicken sandwiches are literally 2 pieces of chicken in a bun which is plenty if you're not that hungry. The fish sandwich with tartar sauce is also very satisfying. Get the large sweet tea cuz it's so good!! Got the sweet potato pie by the cashier too. It was good and sweet but a little too greasy for me. Overall, a must stop when in Charlotte!",

Each Chicken Dinner comes with tatter tot/hash browns that are \"crispy goodness\" and also a small side cup of coleslaw and a dinner roll.  I don't like coleslaw at all, but I tried it because everything else is good.  I still didn't like it but people say it's good so you be the judge for yourself.  My friend ordered the bbq sandwich which included the coleslaw on it which she was unaware of but she loved it.    Also, they make the best sweet tea on the planet!  Yes, I said it.  Don't waste your time getting one of the cups of sweet tea.  Pay the extra $1 or so and get a half gallon for yourself or a couple people and pay for a cup of ice and enjoy it.  We ordered just two cups and went to a nearby seating area to enjoy our food and the weather.  We loved the tea so much that my friend walked back to the store just get a half gallon so we could keep the refills flowing.  Come for the chicken, wait patiently in the quick line, and fall in love with the sweet tea.  You won't regret the trip.",

I showed up around 12 noon on a Saturday and was expecting long lines.  It was busy but not as crazy as I expected.  I only waited about a min or so before the nice cashier called me over to her to take my order.  I told her this was my first time here and had heard great things about their food.  She gave me a great big smile and welcomed me.  I ordered the half chicken dark meat dinner.  I also got a sweet potato fried pie.  She disappeared and came back with a white box and bag. I paid my bill (bring cash... They don't do cards!) and walked out with my food.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going  Now there is no place to sit here... It is strictly counter service.  I saw people siting outside on the ground... On stairs... In their cars... Where ever they could to enjoy their chicken hot. I went back to my car and opened up the box.... And it looked and smelled so good!  I was going to take it back to my hotel room to eat but decided it was too far away and the chicken would be cold so I had a picnic in my car!  The chicken was the best I have ever had.  I love me some Publix Chicken but this beats it hands down.  The dinner had two legs, two thighs, french fries, cold slaw, and two hush puppies.  It was filling for me but it was too good to not eat while hot.  I saved the pie for later in the day and that too was great but I should have heated it up in the microwave first.  I would have been better warm.  Atmosphere = 5  Service = 8  Food = 10  I really enjoyed the experience of Prices and will try to go back one more time before I leave. Just bring cash and your hunger and you won't be disappointed!  Enjoy!",

I was raised in Kentucky, home of Colonel Sanders' KFC, Indi's, and numerous other fried chicken joints so I have pretty high standards when it comes to fried chicken. There's not a place to eat, which is why I am downgrading it a star since it's best when you eat it hot and fresh out of the fryer. It's definitely a whole in the wall and a madhouse in there with a ton of customers and a ton of employees. I split the whole dark chicken with a side of fries and a side of slaw. The meat was still juicy in spite of the perfectly crispy skin. The sides were okay. The star is definitely the chicken. Tip: this is a cash only place.",

I had the 4 wing dinner which is a lot of food for the price. It was all fresh and delicious! Chicken had the perfect amount of crunchy exterior and juicy meat. Only reasons I didn't give five stars are that their hush puppies are nothing spectacular, but you only get two of them and the .85 tea is mostly ice.   I will definitely return in the near future!",

Pros: old school chicken shack, reasonable prices, chicken is fried good but not hard, chicken is yummy, friendly cashiers and is cash only - very easy. Oh sweet tea is definitely south sweet tea.   Cons: wings are smaller than I expected, fries are basic crinkle frozen joints, sweet potatoe pie was ok.   Oh yeah fyi, get in where you fit in when you walk in, find a register and stand in the line.   I was advised by cashier next time I come the fried fish (perch) is most popular!!!",

Chicken was juicy, just the right amount of crisp too. Potato salad... I'm sure it was good, but it's all about the chicken and the sweet tea (not to sweet but sweet enough)! Def going back here. Make sure to have cash although they do have an atm machine inside.   And be prepared to wait in line for awhile even though lines seem short because some staff take their sweet time servicing you.

The batter is super light and crisp with a satisfying crunch that won't break your teeth or rip your gums like some other places. The 2-piece dark dinner hits the spot just right. But to be honest, the first time I had it, I walked right back in and ordered a second 2-piece dark for the road. The dinners come with fries, coleslaw, 2 hushpuppies, and a dinner roll (Kings Hawaiian maybe?). Anyways, the fried chicken and hushpuppies are amazing. I would stay clear of the fried chicken gizzards though unless you like super soft and flaccid ones...lol. It seems like they tenderize them and aren't kept as hot as everything else. I'm used to gizzards with a crunchy/rubbery texture so the limp/tender gizzards just don't do it for me. Def isn't fresh out of the fryer though so be warned if you actually enjoy it flaccid.",

And I had ate it cold during my layover in Chicago! I also ordered a pecan pie (what's visiting the south without having one?), but it was a pre packaged Sara Lee pie... wish they made their own. The chicken was nice and moist and the best part is that even though it was cold it still had a crunch to the battered portion.   There were so many people that the line was out the door. The store front is very small so there were three separate (or four not sure) lines so they could keep us moving along to get our chicken fix.

Ok, $12 for just the bird seemed a bit pricey, but they're independently owned, so I overlooked it. Bojangles has a lot more wiggle room in pricing, because of the sheer volume.  What I couldn't overlook, at the end of dinner, was that it didn't taste better than Bojangles. Now, I do love Bojangles, but I hoped since I was paying more for somewhat home-cooked taste that Price's would be worth the price. It was not.

    "text": "They say that after finishing his filming, Lenny Kravifz missed Price's chicken so much that he had some flown to him out of state. Whether True or not, it seems plausible. Price's chicken is HANDS DOWN THE BEST fried chicken anywhere.  That $9 styrofoam carry out box contains love: a half chicken all crispy and brown, deep fried tots, 2 hushpuppies (terrific!), a great little tub of cole slaw poked with a pickle slide and anchored with a toothpick, and an inexplicable uncut hamburger bun. My box lasts 2 full meals for me and that's only if I share the wing. The place is as rundown as you get, there's nowhere to eat. You might get some streetside parking or a spot behind the strip but eating in your car is usually the best option so the chicken doesn't cool too much. If you can make it to the park, so much the better. There are always 4 lines with several people in each and boy, do they crank those orders out! You can get a sweet tea but sodas require some change for the coke machine off to the side. They don't come any no frills-ier. The chicken swims in a lake of oil which is somehow mastered by unseen hands. It is always served perfectly cooked: so hot you can still see bubbles but still moist. It isn't a crust, either - that skin is chicken crack. OMG GOOD. The hours are weird, the parking is odd but the fact that it is filled with African American grand-mamas tells you that it is worth it. Oh, and it is. Just ask Lenny Kravitz.",

The tray is served with the round hash browns but we usually substitute one for the potato salad.  Their potato salad is SO GOOD!  However, the price and amount that you get are not equal.  The serving size is smaller now, probably 3-4 tablespoons at most.  This is only enough to feed a one-year old!  I was disappointed.  I don't plan to visit the Coop anytime soon.  It is no longer worth the trip, nor the $.  In addition, there were loiterers outside panhandling (against the rules) which is not good for business.",

Cons:  Crazy hours - caters to the lunch crowd in Southend, or someone who can sneak out of their Uptown cubicle for an hour.  I think they're closed on Mondays, which makes absolutely no sense but that might be when they're chopping chickens for the week.  No place to eat, but you don't want to eat there.  Take it to your office and make people jealous.  Again, it's a dive.  So it's not for everyone I guess.",

    "text": "\"Come hungry and leave overstuffed.\" That should be under the sign at Price's Chicken Coop. I have been dying to try this place since i moved here in October. My apartment is right around the corner and every money when i go to my car all i can smell is fried chicken. Finally this weekend i grabbed some cash and went with my parents. We decided to get a whole bird because there were 3 of us and it seemed more economical than individual dinners. We also got sides of coleslaw, tater totes, and hush puppies. Oh damn those hush puppies. They were the sole reason i left stuffed. They were way too good and everything about them was memorizing. I will be the first to admit i am not much of a chicken person. I loved deep fried food like the rest of America but i'll take beef over chicken any day. Price's chicken is very good. It is tender and very well spiced. My only complaint is that i wish the skin had been crispier. Mine was somewhat soggy and that is disappointing since the skin is always my favorite part. The tater totes are good but nothing to write home about and my dad loved the coleslaw. All in all my advice is that no matter what you order at Price's make sure you get plenty of hush puppies.",

I am admittedly not born and bred in the South and no one in my family has a clue how to make homemade fried chicken so my experience in life thus far has been buckets of KFC.   KFC doesn't hold a candle to whatever they have going on at Price's, it is certainly a no frills place, it's takeout only, and it's not open on Sunday or Monday.  I have only gotten the quarter chicken white meal for $6.25 with a sweet tea of course, an extra 75 cents.  I can afford that!  The meal comes with the chicken, a roll, the most delicious tater tots in the universe, hush puppies, and some pretty tasty cole slaw.  It is served in a cardboard box that is already greasy when you leave the place.  After you eat you will need a nap and I would suggest only going here once a month at most for fear you will have a heart attack if you frequent it.  But it is so delicious, the chicken is juicy, the outside is crispy, and the sides and sweet tea are amazing.  If you are ever in the South End or Charlotte in general you have to make a stop here!",

Funny, when you go around lunch, people park and eat on the street, sometimes you see people sit on the lawn across the street enjoying their lunch, somewhat communal, but the main thing you see is everyone walking out with their white boxes of fried chicken goodness. Consistently good.   My usual is 1/4 white dinner, comes with a breast and a wing. In the box, is a nice portion of tater tots, two corn bread hush puppies and cole slaw, finally a white bread roll.   The fried perch was good as well as the fried shrimp.   There is a reason why Prices has been here for as long as they have.  Great place!",

I have been mentioning to people I went and they say its so good, they hadnt been in while and end up going and getting re-addicted to it.

The chicken was fantastic and amazingly worth the hype. I had the 1/4 white meat chicken dinner.. comes with tater rounds, slaw, hushpuppies, and dinner roll. Also got sweet tea (an obvious good decision). The tater rounds were a little salty, but good. Slaw was surprisingly great and flavorful, not overly-mayo saturated. Chicken was very flavorful, crispy, not greasy and unbelievably tender. I was with another friend who got the chicken sandwich... which had breast and wing on a bun (bones included). A little odd, but I guess you're supposed to remove the bones yourself and make a sandwich.. ??   The service was tremendous also. The woman helping us was very nice and answered all questions willingly. Sometimes you go to well-known places for the first time and the cashier will be a little curt due to answering the same questions over-and-over... not the case here. Cashier was very, very nice and attentive. Even though it was lunchtime with lots of customers, we were in and out really quick.. about 5 minutes.   Also, expect to eat in your car... there's no where to sit. I understood this before going, so it was no surprise. Ended up eating on the trunk of my car, it was such a nice day it was great... felt like we were tailgating without the beer. The street was littered with chicken bones so we definitely weren't the first with this idea.",

I pulled up and the line was out the door  the street parking was full and I found a parking lot behind the building. I walked up hoping to get out of the heat and I had to slither in bc the room was full everyone was elbow to elbow and of course it was hotter than Hades inside too... i had no intention of getting the sweet tea bc I was told it was really sweet and all I pictures were my teeth burning bc it was too sweet... I was so parched I had no choice but to order the tea... it was delicious ! Perfect Southern Sweet Tea ... I ordered a whole chicken and when I got to the car I unveiled THEEE most beautiful golden bird pieces. I think it was anointed. It was hot and I burned my fingerprints off but that didn't stop me from enjoying the best fried chicken I had in my entire life. Oh the service was good too and it was quick but my goodness I can't wait to go back- I hope they don't relocate - this chicken is amazing and it needs to be a landmark",

The only reason I found this place was driving down to Charleston and wanted to find a place where the locals go.  When a hole in the wall shack and saw a line of locals out the door and around the block in a run down neighborhood.  I knew it had to be special.

That's how good it is.  There's nothing quite like forcing yourself into that mass of humanity and coming out with a greasy box of chicken (and fixin's) and running through the meadow to your family in Freedom Park and digging in.  Unfortunately there seems to be less chicken in the box when you arrive at the park than when you left.  I don't understand how that works.  Nonetheless - it's greasy.  That's what makes it good.  Deal with it.  The Coop doesn't close at any particular time, no matter what anyone says.  They close when the chicken runs out, so if you want chicken, you get there early.  In other words, don't get your underwear in a bunch to get there just before the doors close, because there is a very good chance that it's all going to be gone.  These people have been doing their job for a long time - they aren't going to run out right at closing time.  That's when they go home.  That means everything is shut down and cleaned up then.  The chicken will have been long gone by then.  On the process - it's like the Soup Nazi, without the need to stand in line and move two steps to the left.  It's more like a somewhat-controlled mob.  Have your cash ready and when you get to the counter, place your order.  If you get to the counter and don't have your order, be prepared for someone else to take your place.  And don't go getting upset, okay?  You've now been warned.",

The sweet tea is WAY too sweet for me, but then again, I'm from the west coast, so sweet tea is a foreign concept for me to begin with.",

    "text": "Got there with 8 minutes to spare before closing.  Two men were standing at the front door like body guards, telling us to hurry up and come in if we were going to order.  I ordered, was immediately told they were out of dark meat, then told that dark meat was available.  I confirmed that I wanted a dinner and no sweet tea.  A few sides were listed and I had trouble understanding if I was supposed to choose from the sides and what exactly the options were.  A very annoyed cashier eventually made me understand that my dinner comes will all of the things she listed.  No, biscuits are not a thing here.    I was devastated to find that tater tots are no longer being offered.  Everyone's meal photos with the tots looked so great.  The fries were just ok.  I like mine soggy, not crispy, so these school-cafeteria style fries were better than homefries or anything like that, but more mushy than limp so not exactly my cup of tea.  They were plenty salted though!  Honestly, I'd have much preferred sweet potato fries or criss-cross waffle-cut fries, but with 6 minutes to go, beggars can't be choosers.    I liked that there was a pickle slice on my coleslaw but the slaw was too tangy for me.  I ate the pickle though!  The roll was generic but the hush puppies smelled and tasted like onion--I really liked that!!!  My dark meat included one surprisingly small drumstick, one nice sized thigh, and a small thigh.  Definitely preferable to a wing, so thank you for that!  My box opened directly onto a baby fork wrapped with a single ketchup packet and a salt packet (totally unnecessary) atop a napkin the size of the box which was already fairly saturated with oil and coleslaw juice.  We found a nearby rail line set of chairs and scarfed--it was delicious (as we were to the bugs, we soon found out).  Glad we ate it hot and fresh.  I'm not sure what reheated chicken would have been like, given the soft texture of the breading.  I really did find it juicy and delicious, but I'm not ready to call this the best in Charlotte.  I haven't found anything better, but I'm new so I'm not going to jump to conclusions.  Maybe next time I'll try them earlier in the day and see if that makes a difference.  I've been trying to track my finances better and since this was cash, I wish I would have gotten a receipt or a price marked on the box cover, as I don't remember the actual price paid.  Somewhere in the $7 range, but what I remember is more than any of the current photos+tax should be so I'm not totally sure.",

Who knows what took me so long but I can finally cross this one off of my bucket list!   There is nothing fancy about Price's. It's all take out and they do not accept credit/debit cards so bring cash or at least your debit card since there is an ATM on site. And when you enter the door, find a line....there's at least 4 of them and wait your turn.  The menu consists of fried dinners and sandwiches...chicken, shrimp, fish and a few sides. Each dinner comes with an abundance of potato rounds, hush puppies and slaw.    For my first meal from Price's I went with the 1/3 chicken white meal. The chicken had a nice coating which was not over spiced like some places and the chicken was moist and tender - the way good fried chicken should be. The potato rounds were a great addition as well as the hush puppies. The slaw was ok but I am not normally a fan of slaw anyway so I wasn't expecting much.  Price's gets busy all day long so allow enough time to get your meal and go. There is no dining space but I've seen people eating adjacent to the light rail across the street in nicer weather.  There is metered parking (25 cents for 15 minutes) on the street and Price's also has a small lot behind the building.  I can see why Price's is consistently voted best fried chicken. Living so close to here, I promise to be back soon!",

POOP due to the poopy (not the word I really want to use) service that me and my 66 yrs old mother and I received on 05/12/2018 (Saturday) around 5:00 pm.   We were in line waiting to be helped. Unfortunately, we got into the wrong line waiting to be served by a short lady with orangish-pinkish skin wearing a  black scarf on her head. After waiting awhile, we found out that the server was extremely slow and unorganized. She took several orders but was not fulfilling the orders which slowed down her line. Instead of taking maybe three orders, fulfilling them, and then move onto the next customers, this fool took about 8 orders in a row without fulfilling them. So when me and my mom got  to the front of the line she was trying to fulfill several orders but she was having a problem reading her own handwriting to know what the previous customers  ordered. Smh. The customers behind me were also upset because they also waited for awhile. My mom asked her if we should go into another line if she was extremely busy and she shrugged her shoulders like a child and said, \"If you want\". We were in line for 10 - 12 minutes at the point. No accommodations were made after waiting for so long. We told a manager what occurred and he was immediately trying to defend the sorry server without investigating what happened.  He attempted to take our order (with some hesitation)but me and my mom were over it and  decided to leave. No need to patronize a business with poor customer service. Plus! I didn't really need the grease anyway. Sign from God?    I use to go to this place several times during the Summer when I visited Charlotte starting as a child (80's).  I had very good memories of this place until now. I was visiting from out of town recently hoping to revisit a good childhood memory and that was no longer the case. Although I am not a Charlotte native, my family members are True natives, born and raised. I was warned not to go there because \"things have changed\" but I wanted to go anyway. I should have listened because things have definitely changed, especially the staff. In the good ol'days you could expect expedient service where the servers had pride in thier jobs.  This didn't happen with the orangish-pinkish skin lady or her manager as they both seem to be incompetent. The people that really know Price's knows how it used to be. They want to run the business in an old fashioned way (no credit/debit cards, black cooks) but not have the old fashioned, good customer service to go along with it. Overall, I was very disappointed and needless to say...farewell Price's...I will never return. Poopy service is just not my thing.  Good luck to your future.",

Staying in the Epicenter, I took the rail which put me about 2 blocks away from Prices within 10 minutes.   Thankfully the line wasn't out the door (2pm on weekday), but it was busy inside. I'm glad that I didn't plan on dining in as there were no tables, chairs, counters, etc. I saw several people eating in their cars, across the street on the lawn by the rails, and down the block seated on top of anything they could find.   Despite being pretty busy, the line moved fast and the food came out quickly. When I asked for hot sauce, I was told it would be a nickel. Obviously, that's not much but seeing how chicken and hot-sauce go so well together why not just give a pack (like they do with the ketchup)?   While I thought the chicken was good, it wasn't AMAZING. So, why am I giving it 4 stars? Because I did enjoy it would definitely get it again...and again.  If I'm back in the area I'll have to try the sweet tea.",

My chicken was rather salty,greasy and coleslaw was on the vinegar side. It is a Charlotte ICON....  and a  HILARIOUS place to be in the height of the lunch rush. The Ladies/ Gents take your order then bark it like Army Sergeants. Over their shoulder the view of floured chicken parts being flung into hot grease to order is mesmerizng. Go-Cups of Sweet Tea and sides are ready for the pickin'.  The place is run like organized madness.  It's a visual lesson of thru-put. IMHO    TAKE OUT ONLY!",

I don't know what they do to the chicken before they batter it, but whatever it is, it's nothing short of amazing!  Most places you've got blah chicken after you peel off/eat the skin- at the Chicken Coop, their chicken is melt in your mouth amazing!  It's the kind of chicken where you catch yourself sucking on the bones! (Sometimes it's worth the shame of bad manners for that last little bit of deep fried heaven!) Hands-down the best fried chicken I've ever had.  For those that aren't fans of dark meat, you can order a \"whole white chicken\" for a little bit more.  Prices are insanely low for this quality - I guess it's because they keep it simple and stick to what they're good at!  The other reviewers have it spot on: Always crowded, but line moves fast. Cash only. Park in the lot behind the alley, take it to your car & eat it there. Have your order ready when you get to the front, or they'll skip you. Don't you dare talk on your cell phone while placing an order. (Remember Seinfeld's Soup Nazi? Yeah, it's a little like that!)",

This is a great place to go and grab some take out (no dining area) in the heart of Charlotte. Prices will own a place in my heart because it was my  first ever experience with Carolina BBQ. Remembering the chopped pork with the spicy/tangy sauce makes my belly smile at the thought of it. Almost makes me shed a tear in my sweet tea. Which there is none up North with all these Yankees in Boston which is ironic I thought Yankees were from NY? Who knew... So bottom line: drive, bike, run, walk or crawl go to Prices and you will not be sad you did.....",

The chicken has obviously been brined because it is very flavorful and juicy.  We ordered the fried shrimp and 1/4 chicken dinners.  It's pretty much all pretty unhealthy. - fried, totally breaded shrimp or 2 pieces of chicken - tons of deeply fried tater tots (I think they were fried several times because they were SUPER fried - a few hush puppies (but that's all you can really eat) - a white dinner roll (think Wonderbread) - a little condiment cup of cole slaw - pickle (the only healthy?? thing in the box)  The fried shrimp was meh...  too much breading.  Cole slaw - I like KFC's better.  But the chicken...  I'd have to say it was pretty darn tasty - the best in the country?  definitely up there.  The iced tea - well, it was too sweet for my tastebuds (it tasted like diluted honey; my 6yo loved it)  The people there were actually quite pleasant and nice - not chatty, but very nice and friendly.  There are two soda machines (75 cents for a can) if you want something besides the iced tea.  Though there is no place to eat, outside the storefront there are some grassy areas to sit and eat.",

Price's has been around probably longer than I have and with good reason. The location is awful but, is it worth it? YES! If you give money to beggars - bring an extra buck or 2 because half the time there's someone just outside asking for money (hey, it's True - I'm not knocking them). You'd think the location would be a deterrent for  your more businessy types but, all walks of life are found at Price's. If you want the best fried food that you've ever put in your face-hole - you can't beat Price's. You can't eat in - it's to go but, I wouldn't dare call it fast food (I also wouldn't dare call it healthy - it's what they call \"food for the soul\"). PS. my grandma (who has lived in dilworth for longer than I've been alive) says the fried fish at Showmars is better. (Still, the fried chicken is the best).",

I watched the cooks fry the pieces of chicken and I'm pretty sure they don't season them with anything other than flour, salt, and pepper and the taste of the food reflects that.  As another reviewer mentioned, \"grease\" is not an ingredient!  The taste was acceptable.  The hushpuppies were classic North Carolina.  I was quite surprised (and disappointed) that they use Sara Lee pre-packaged dinner rolls instead of biscuits typical of southern comfort food.    I can't believe I'm saying this, but I would recommend Bojangles for a southern fried chicken (and biscuits) experience.",

There were approximately 20+ staff 15 or so were working and the others were just standing around.  For get about Burger King's getting your way.  Here at Price's you get it their way no exceptions.  After waiting about 25 minutes we got our food and got out of there to find a place to eat in our truck.  The chicken was mostly old and cold.  The chicken livers were over cooked to the point of being dehydrated.  The only thing that was good hot and fresh was an order of fried OKRA.  The help was very abrupt and very unfriendly.  I tried to speak to one that was not working and was completely ignored.  Oh' well,  the good thing about it is that we will never have to go back.  Maybe it was just a bad day to go there.",

The multiple chicken dinner offerings are served in square cardboard boxes, similar to small pizza boxes and no dining room or washrooms are available, so plan on bringing some wipes or making a trip to a local gas station to wash up after you chicken lunch. Although I was not aware of this when we arrived, I opted for a chicken sandwich, for minimal mess, however, the sandwich consisted of boned chicken in between two pieces of bread, so I still had to gnaw on the chicken pieces. The chicken itself was prepared well, in that it did not have an overly greasy aftertaste. The sides, which included Burger Kingesque style hash brown rounds and hushpuppies were fine too.   Price's Chicken Coop is a area instutution in Charlotte and should be visited when looking for local attractions.  Parking is available in a back lot as street parking is limited to 20 minutes.",

(I'm a poet and I don't even know it) Crispy, delicious, juicy. In my humble opinion worth a visit. Crowded during lunch but wait is not long.",

    "text": "EXCELLENT!!!!  Some of the best fried chicken I've ever tasted.  This place can be crowded, but it is so worth the trip and the wait.  It has been there for years and famous in Charlotte.   You can't eat there, you have to take it to go.  They give you a lot of fried potatoes and hush puppies with the meals, which makes you feel even more full.  But I would definitely go back to just get a half chicken and nothing else.  LOVED IT!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I'd heard about this place but had never really looked it up or found it.  Since we were in Charlotte for the day I decided to find it and check it out.  It wasn't too far from the South Park area where we were staying so we hit it for lunch.  I'm a big fried chicken fan and I like to try out the chicken at most restaurants and buffets in the area if I have a chance.  My brother-in-law had told me he had gone here and really lied it.  It's strictly carry-out..no tables, no parking.  You have to park on the street.   Unfortunately we didn't order a dinner so I didn't get to try any of the sides...we only wanted to try their chicken.  My wife and I both ordered a breast and wing.  I had a sweet tea.  The chicken is as good as most of the people say.  Nice and juicy, crisp skin.  Since we didn't order a dinner they gave it to us wrapped up in a thin paper and a lot of napkins.  I would say it's some of the best chicken that I've tasted....not the best.  The best chicken I've had in South Carolina is Bernie's in Columbia.  This would run a close second with Shealy's Buffet in Batesville-Leesburg area.  I'd like to go back and try a dinner next time..  Highly recommend the chicken though.  Cash only...no credit cards.",

I kept hearing about how delicious it is so I finally made it in and yep everyone was right it is fried and tasty wonderfulness. This place could fry a cell phone and I'd probably eat it.   I didn't go with the usual and get the chicken my guy and I opted for the fish that day. It came with a pile of tator tots and 2 fluffy hush puppies potato salad and a tiny side of tartar sauce. I only wish the fish pieces had been a little larger but taste good they sure did.   I bet the chicken is really where its at and I look forward to returning to give it a go real soon. Parking isn't to bad but lunch is really busy there they move people in and out with ease but be prepared to eat your food on the sidewalk outside by the train track which to me only adds to the charm of the place. Be sure to stop in for some great lunch if your in the mood for fried goodness.",

You walk in to a counter top with ladies waiting to take your order, and you better be ready! Like the Seinfeld Soup Nazi, the line backs up quick, and they expect you to order quickly! Fried chicken served white or dark, whole or half bird, and there's shrimp and gizzards too! Sides of hush puppies and tater tots are offered, and like everything else it's fried! The batter is extremely light, which lets the juicy flavor shine throughout! There's no tables to sit down, and as you get your plain white cake box with your chicken inside, you realize your looking for a grassy spot somewhere to eat like your homeless!",

I had the 1/4 white chicken box. it comes with a breast and a wing,2 hashpuppies,coleslaw,good amount of hashbrowns and a roll. oh the 1 packet of ketchup,lol OK,the roll is like the one you get from the grocery store.  hashpuppies were good ! and hashbrowns ,cant go wrong with those !!!  cole slaw is meh,the texture is too watery and a bit acidic. not a fan of it. The fried chicken was excellent !!!! it was meaty ! you get a good amount of meat for the breast ! its like twice the amount of meat compare to other fried chicken places. the meat is tender and moist. however, i wish they had hot sauces or had spicy marinated chicken options.   overall great deal for $8 !!!!  oh i think they only accept cash at this place!",

I think Bojangles chicken is better in both taste and size. I do like the potato rounds (they give you a ton), and the hush puppies are very good with an onion-y flavor. I don't eat coleslaw but my husband does and he says it's downright awful. He throws it out every time. We've gone there maybe 5-6 times and each time I'm left wondering what the rest of Charlotte sees and tastes that I'm not getting.   To be fair, my husband disagrees with my post and says he'd give them 4 out of 5 stars. He loves their chicken. Go figure!",

    "text": "Ordered a quarter dark dinner with a side of potato salad and sweet tea for under $10 - plenty of food for one. Came with a drumstick and a thigh, bread, slaw, tater rounds and hush puppies. I don't usually like drumsticks but this was not dry at all!  Potato salad was creamy and not mushy, flavourful with a hint of tang.  Hush puppies weren't bad, better than most I've had in Charlotte. Slaw was creamy with a hint of sweet. I usually prefer newest tea but this was good. Sweet but not too sweet. Chicken has a nice crisp outer layer and moist all the way through. Tater rounds are pretty standard.   I went on a Saturday afternoon, not packed, good service. I sampled the gizzard and liver. She made suggestions on what to order based on what I wanted. Was willing to sub the slaw with potato salad but I wanted to try both. For $0.90 you might as well try the potato salad. And for $0.85 you might as well get the tea. Or two. Or a gallon.   Wish they had homemade desserts. They have a variety of commercial desserts like Sarah Lee pecan pie slice, pound cake, nothing too exciting.   It was an overall great experience but the chicken was lacking in flavour, hence the lost star. The chicken should be the highlight and it fell short. It had a great crunchy outer but otherwise bland. Nothing beats mom's fried chicken.   Expect to be greasy for days. You get one whole packet of ketchup. If you like it saucy bring your own bottle of ketchup. I came home so I didn't care. Not sure if I'll be back.",

It's nice to know that a business run by mostly black people FOR black people can survive in an area that is quickly being populated by young white couples and their babies. #GentrificationIsReal  The lady who took my order was a very sweet and friendly woman. Definitely gave off that \"Southern hospitality\" vibe that I had felt was lacking in my travels around Charlotte.  I ordered the 2 piece Dark Meat Chicken dinner. The chicken was solid. It was crispy but not greasy and clearly fresh. The meat itself was seasoned - I bet they brine it beforehand. I could eat a whole bucket of this chicken.  The sides felt like a hit or miss. The standard dinner roll was basic - I could do without it. I think it would be better if it was hot. The hushpuppies were awesome. They had a sweet onion flavor to them. The fries were alright - but also pretty basic. I would probably swap the fries for tator rounds or fried giblets.  The food came out very quickly and I didn't have to wait, but that was because I came in at 10am. And it was already pretty busy, so keep that in mind.  Cash and takeout only.

The menu is limited but it has exactly what you came for chicken and a few options if you are getting a little crazy. We took the plunge and stood in line for a quick ten minutes. We split the half chicken dinner which was more than enough for two. The fries were crisp and had a good amount of salt. The slaw was fresh and had a pickle flavor that was a nice balance to the meal. Hush puppies were hot and had a light onion flavor. Plain white roll, perfect fit for the CHICKEN! Big white breast chicken that was hot and juicy. The chicken had a salty, crisp breading that really kept in the moisture during cooking. Add some hot sauce (5 cents a pack) and the chicken is a serious hit.   The neighborhood has clearly changed since this place has opened. This is the kind of place that needs all the love so it never has to change. Carry out only here like it should be.",

    "text": "This review is ONLY for their chicken gizzards, and one other small irritating thing.  Let me start with the fact that I have heard nothing but good things about the food that is served up. I haven't tried anything but the potato salad and the gizzards so far, and the potato salad was good, but the gizzards let me down. How do you ask? One, this is my second time trying the gizzards, the first maybe 6/7 months ago and when I opened the styro I saw some pretty bald and softly fried gizzards. Now I'm sure there are folks that like them that way, not me! I like my gizzards fried hard, somewhat large and tasty, with a very  heavy batter that has a nice crunch when you take that first bite.  Well, not Price's. I went back a week ago and asked for the gizzards to be fried hard....and needless to say when I opened the styrofoam this second trip, they were cooked the same way. They had very little batter, almost naked and soooo soft to the bite. I did not like them. That's all I have to say about those gizzards. No more ordering them from that restaurant. Now, two more things that irritated me, first, I called to place the order and was told that it's not busy at all so just come in and order. When I arrived 6 minutes later there was a long line and I ended up waiting about 15 minutes for them.  Just take my order over the phone so it can be ready when I arrive or tell me that you don't take phone orders..... lastly, you can't have gizzards without hot sauce so I asked for some. I was told that it's 5 cents a pack, and it's the little packets you get in the plastic like from the Chinese restaurant!! Really!!??  You probably get a box of a thousand for $2  but regardless you can't give a couple of packets to your folks that buy your food? That's like nickel and diming us to death. I didn't like that, you're already getting a kickback from the ATM that is in your establishment because you don't take credit cards. And to be honest, the people(including myself) already can't afford the $2.50 -$5 they will have as an added charge by the bank.  All that being said I will try their chicken, make sure I have cash, and my personal bottle of hot sauce in the car. #gizzardsfriedhard",

Order the 1/4 white dinner with side of gizzards and sweet tea. The coleslaw is to die for! The gizzards are the best I've ever had and the chicken is seasoned well and was juicy.

Be prepared, there is always a line but it moves quickly. The menu is pretty basic, different combos of chicken (1/4 dark, 1/4 light, wings) with standard sides of slaw, fries and hush puppies. It's seasoned so perfectly that I often wait for my late grandmother to emerge from the kitchen and say \"Hi\"! I have had the fish sandwich, too, which is very tasty. But the chicken is a must!  Take a drink with you if you don't like really sweet sweet tea. And be prepared to eat either in your vehicle or on a curb nearby as there's no seating inside. You'll see people strolling the streets eating from their boxes because they can't wait to sit down to indulge.   If you come to Charlotte, make sure you check out this awesome local favorite.",

    "text": "Listen. I was RAISED on Chicken Coop. Few memories tug at my heartstrings more than picking up a whole bird dark with tots and pups (Chicken Coop speak for tater tots and hushpuppies) from the Coop with my mom and siblings, and meeting my dad during his lunch break for a picnic at Latta Plantation Park.  Twenty five years ago!!! And while most things have stayed the same, some have changed. Like how they quit selling their amazing tater tots and now they only sell crinkle fries. *rolls eyes in disgust* My brother legit almost had a conniption when I told him about the change. Those tater tots were perfection. Golden brown, lightly salted and delicious, I'll always remember them. Usually there were quite a few tots stuck together in a potato-y ball, but that made them even more magical. And you always had to ask for extra ketchup because they would rubber band a single ketchup packet around a fork and send you on your way if you didn't ask for extras. Okay. Enough nostalgia. What to know about Chicken Coop?   First, it's cash only. I always stop to get cash on the way (there's a WF a couple of blocks over on South Blvd).   Park either on the street (which used to be free but is now metered- like a quarter for 15 minutes or something) or behind the building. I usually just park on the street and run in. I've been going to Chicken Coop since my childhood and street parking has been free...so yeah. I'm not paying.  Next, there's no seating inside, so plan to either eat in the car (my personal fave- nothing like scarfing down a piping hot fish sandwich) or take it back to the office/home.   Third, when you go in to order, it will likely be cramped. Don't panic. Folks will politely slide around for you to get inside. Find the shortest line, DECIDE ON WHAT YOU WANT, get off your cell phone, and place your order. Don't be that person who waited in line and then got to the front and started hemming and hawing.   What to eat. My mom still swears by the whole bird dark, and religiously orders chicken and a pound of barbecue for large family meals. You can go her way, or you can listen to me. *Listen to me.* Order a fish sandwich, with extra tartar. Just do it. You can always come back and get the chicken/hushpuppies or barbecue later. First time has to be the fish. With extra tartar. I say skip the fries and order a sweet tea, but be prepared to let the ice melt in the tea a tidge before you drink it...cause it's SUPER SWEET.  Things to know: They're generally open 10-6, closed Sunday and Monday. During holidays, PLAN AHEAD! They close the night of Christmas Eve and don't re-open until after the New Year. Don't go in there asking for healthy food- I once heard a girl say, \"Oh, is everything fried?!\" YES GIRL, EVERYTHING IS FRIED. Now order something or step aside lol. I'll stop rambling and just say, if you go to Chicken Coop, get the fish. You're welcome. :)",

There's no seating (it's all take-out) and they close early for dinner (6:00 p.m.), so you'll need to stop on the way home from work if you work 'til 5:00!    Anyway, we picked up some fried chicken one evening and brought it to Freedom Park to eat on a picnic table.  It made for a nice summer picnice and, for fried chicken (which I already mentioned I'm not a big fan of in general), it was very good.  It had a lot of flavor and everyone enjoyed the casual hands-on dinner.  We tried the potato salad, too.  It was also good (although we didn't use our hands for that).

I'm not a huge fried chicken connoisseur, i just like what I like.  Overall, i found the chicken good, well fried, but very very salty.  And the tea was SUPER sweet.  Like, get a cavity immediately sweet.  The hush puppies and tater rounds were fantastic--hot and crispy.  The cole slaw was ok, again, a little sweet.  I bought a small side of potato salad, and that was pretty good.  Overall, the whole meal was good, just the chicken was too salty.  Cash only!  But super fast, they aren't messing around.  Know what you want before you get to the counter!  This is total sacrilege, but I've become quite attached to the fried chicken at Cracker Barrel on Sundays (so much so that my family and I say, when traveling, \"Chicken Sunday!\" in hopes of stopping there on our way somewhere.)

The only knocks I can give Prices is that a) it's cash only; b) it's carry-out only, and there nowhere in the immediate area to eat except your car; c) the side dishes are a bit of an afterthought; and d) there's always a huge line. As others have said, if you don't know what you want, or if you're talking on a cell phone, STEP OUT OF THE LINE so the rest of us can get on with our day.  That said, my tip is this: the most popular lunches are the 1/4 chicken dinners. During the lunch rush, a couple of employees will make these non-stop and stack them up. But sometimes the dinners don't get rotated out properly. The 1/2 chicken dinners are made to order each time, so if you order one of those you're guaranteed that it's fresh and hot.",

Of course, in that time, multiple lines had formed and we had to stake a place real fast.   We ordered a 1/2 Chicken (dark meat) dinner box, and a 1/4 Chicken (white meat) dinner box. After getting our food, we headed to the car and started scarfing everything down (along with other people doing the same thing).   Roll (Merita) -- nothing special. Cole slaw -- all right. Tater rounds (a ton) -- defrosted from a bag. Hushpuppies -- homemade and delicious, BUT we only got 2 single hushpuppies (a sin!). This chicken was so good that I was sucking the chicken bones that my boyfriend had already finished off. I have no shame.  We were full, but still had cravings and were about to go back in and get more. Fortunately, we had restraint -- but we did lustfully look back at the 1/4 Chicken box that was reserved for my boyfriend's mom. (We were good, and fought off the thoughts of substituting KFC in exchange for this heavenly, Southern manna).  ***Skip the dinner box and get a whole chicken! Oh, and get an order or 2 of hushpuppies!",

While on assignment in Charlotte, my sorority sister said we had to go so we went. I had a 2piece white, the sides that are mandatory and included, a shrimp add-on and no tea. Yes, I'm a southerner that truly doesn't drink tea.   Picture this: it's 1957 and all that entails. Meaning no credit/debit cards. Pedestrians are everywhere (and I feel we should be more pedestrian-friendly in the south). No inside dining. The price boards written during this year are still posted in April of 2011. Just as the fifties, the black people work the kitchen and in the back while the white folks work the register. Chicken is being cooked for eight hours straight and will be placed on a plate and served in a white box. The ladies place bread and sides in the white box before its passed to the front.   Zoom to my visit on April 21, 2011; and I had no concept of how this place operates except for other great Yelpers telling us to bring cash & how we wont be able to sit inside. The tater tots were old and I'd prefer fries, I didn't get the whole hushpuppy thing but knew to expect it from Yelp. Think I ain't country? Thank the Lord I was in my flatbed so I was considering sitting on the tailgate and eating but I am a lady so shame forced me to move around. I ate it in the parking lot of a restaurant in the Woodlawn area, I think Zack 's. Anywhoo, chicken lacked seasoning and I gave consideration that I am from Louisiana so we believe in seasoning.  Yet, places in Madison, WI have done better. My chicken was older and luke warm. Bashfully saying: BoJangles is better and thats not saying much. Let me close.",

    "text": "I've heard a lot about this place and made a point to try it.  You have to make a point as their hours are quite short in that they close at 6 pm and are not open on Sundays.  It is definitely an experience, especially to be seen.  The restaurant is a carry out only with just a counter and a line of cashiers.  They're all dressed in white, with a slight dusting of flour that has likely wafted through the air.  It looks exactly like a scene out of a 1950's cafeteria.  There's even an overseer, also dressed in white, who fits the bill, older, heavyset gentleman, watching very carefully the ongoings through his black horned rim glasses.  I asked and they told me it's a long lived family business.  Now, I'm not describing this to imply a negative light, but rather it really is an experience to behold that reminds me a lot of small towns in Texas back in the 70's where I grew up.  Now to the food.  If you don't like chicken or chicken parts, you've come to the wrong place.  They're an efficient menu that cooks chicken and chicken accessories many ways as long as it's fried.  It's True southern fried chicken.  I've tried a few other establishments in the fine city of Charlotte to partake in these southern dishes that I aren't quite replicated in Baltimore, and I'll have to say that in my opinion, they won't rank the best chicken for me.  I'd say it's OK.  I found the skin a bit salty to my taste. And it was a bit dry for me.  But in all fairness, I think the place I have in mind which is the best, the chicken is cooked in lard.  Yeah, so there's that.  So, I wouldn't eat lard fried chicken except for once in a blue moon.  I am pretty certain that Price's does not use lard, though I didn't ask, as it would be too expensive for such a large operation.  I would have taken some photos, but there are like 3 signs in the establishment highly suggesting you don't use your cell phones or other electronic devices.  I was scared that I unholstered my iPhone, I'd be run out of there, soup nazi style.  But I checked and there are some photos already for this restaurant that some brave souls took already which I think are descriptive and of the only things you could take:  fried chicken and the ordering counter.  It is certainly better than the chain chicken restaurants.  So, it's good chicken and a sight to behold.",

You can get this exact bland, semi dry chicken in any part of the ghetto in the Bronx! Come on! This is overpriced garbage. Threw it all away.   I've had legendary fried chicken in Charlotte before. Anyone remembers how the Coffee Cup used to fry chicken?   Their sweet tea was nice...but the tea flavor is nearly drowned out by the waaay too excessive sugar used.  Fly by this coop.

In the short time it takes to order and get your food it is still enough time to notice how friendly everyone is.   Obviously the chicken is top notch so on my last trip I tried the fish sandwich for the first time and boy was it yummy. LOADS of fish that was perfectly seasoned and slathered with tartar sauce. Also don't sleep on the potato salad. I always get a side of it when I get a chicken dinner. Am I disappointed that they no longer have tater rounds? Sure. But if they are going to have fries at least they have crinkle fries.   A take out place with fried items that has perfected packaging to keep your food crispy and hot until you get home BONUS!....that is if you haven't torn into the box on the drive home. Be warned however, after eating here DO NOT OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY ...or try to be productive at work, because all you will want to do is curl up and nap. But you will have a happy belly.",

The fries were just okay and the cole slaw tasted a bit odd to me (and I love creamy slaw). The employees are very fast. The girl who took our order was not friendly at all, no smiles, no have a good day... whatever though I'll take attitude for the best chicken around!

If you like Fried Chicken this is your spot.  Price's is take out only and that doesn't seem to be hurting business, although I do wish they had a little dining area. The food is cooked to order and meals typically come with hush puppies, slaw and a roll. They do offer other items, like perch, shrimp and more, which are all great too.  If you haven't been check them out. And, it is a great place to pick up some food and head to a park or even your backyard to enjoy!",

A good friend came into town and wanted a southern fried chicken and the first thing that came into mind was Price's Chicken Coop! Just walking in a smelling the aroma of fried food was AMAZING!!  The lines we almost out the door on this rainy day but that didn't stop us at all!  We didn't buy one but two boxes of chicken!  We wanted to make sure we had enough for the clan when we get back to the house!  The chicken was juicer and very flavorful.    Last but not least I purchased a slice of pumpkin pie.  Holy moly - it just melted in your mouth.  The only bad choice I made was not purchasing enough slices to share!!  I'm sure from reading my review - you can tell I will definitely be back again and again!!",

They want you to order quickly, mostly because there is usually a decent line up of customers there and they would like to give fast service before they are overwhelmed, so if they see you lagging they may get impatient. They prefer cash only as well, also to save time. The food is delicious, maybe not the best chicken in town, but definitely up there and it's almost a right of passage to eat there if you are in town.

I think the term 'organized chaos' was invented in this little mom n' pop!   The menu is above the counter and read it quickly because the line moves fast. There are different combinations of dark meant, white meat and wings. The have fries, cole slaw, and hushpuppies. The soda machine is stocked with Cheerwine!  The women that tend the counter are the sweetest! You'll probably be called \"babydoll\" or \"sweetpie\" :)  There's no seating, so your only option is to take it to go! Perfect picnic food. Don't be alarmed if you see people eating out of their boxes while walking down the street... they can't wait to dig in sometimes!  Please continue to support this wonderful little establishment!

    "text": "Been on my to do list for years but finally got around to a visit.  With the exception of 3 years in Ohio and 6 years in PA, I've lived in Charlotte or the Charlotte Area since 1970. This place has been around since 1962 and has had great reviews for years for simple fare done right.  The history reminds me a bit of Premanti Bros in the Strip District in Pittsburgh. Both got their start as small restaurants serving worker in nearby warehouses and factory's and developed a very loyal following. When I lived in the Pgh area, the Strip District was enjoying the start of a revival and becoming a destination. When I moved back to  Charlotte, the area around Price's which is called South End was also enjoying the beginning or a revival and today with commuter rail, has become a destination in of itself with massing amounts of housing being built.  One reason I've never made it here before is because when I'm in Charlotte, I'm there for something else and I forget about it.  There was speculation in some of the local media that with all of the building in South End and the closing of a number of other restaurants and venues to make room for new building, was Price's Chicken Coop days number.  I don't know it that is the case but it stuck in my head and when I was in 1st Ward for a meeting at one of the Churches, I made a concerted effort and actually planned out my day to include Price's and I'm glad I did.  Streets area a bit congested with a lot of work being done on the rail line expanding the stations but I was able to find a pretty close parking spot on the street.  Walked in and it was like controlled bedlam. A lot of people waiting but four counters open so the wait was very short.  A brief overview for those who have not been.  It's counter order but you can order ahead but requires 30 minutes for your order. Cash only but ATM close. Take out only and no seating inside or outside either.  That said, I  ordered 1/4 of a 3 1/2 pound Chicken, all white meat Dinner that also included Hushpuppies, Roll, French Fries and Cole Slaw. Tea was extra but all in all a very good value.  Picked up my order in just a couple of minutes and drove back to Cornelius and ate my lunch overlooking Lake Norman.  The Chicken was excellent. Large meaty breast and a wing with a light breading cooked to perfection. The Hush Puppies were good but probably would have been better hot but I got caught in the I-77 Construction Purgatory that all of us in the Northern Part of the County have to deal with.  Roll was good as were the Fries.  The Cole Slaw was pretty good but that that with a grain of salt because I don't normally like Cole Slaw and for me to say it was pretty good is a compliment.  Was it worth the trip,  Definitely yes and I will be back.",

Price's Chicken Coop chicken won, hands down, in my office in a very scientifically performed blind taste testing.  We had nearly 60 participants, and there was no question.  Price's took the gold 49-10!  I called and spoke with Ida yesterday to prep them for our large order.  Upon hearing that we needed 10 chickens worth of food, she barely batted an eyelash... they had it ready when I walked in the door, and that was that.  As for the chicken itself... Just go.  Just GO!  NOW!  It's perfect.  All hail the king of fried chicken... we're not worthy... we're just lucky we have you, Price's!",

    "text": "Hello #400 Yelp Review! I've been saving Price's for this momentous occasion. Price's has been a Charlotte institution since as far back as I remember. It wasn't long after my family moved here in 1996 for us to discover the city's best Mom and Pop fried chicken joint. I've actually never been inside the store since someone else usually orders and picks up the chicken for me but I can imagine that the line can get long at peak dining hours. The food is well worth the wait.  First off, the entire menu fits on the top of the take out box. You know they mean business since they offer just a few things but execute each and every one of those menu items well. The dinners are a complete meal with the main entree accompanied by crinkle fries, two hushpuppies, coleslaw, and a roll. Everything is made with 100% peanut oil and 100% love. The fries are crispy on the outside and chewy in the inside like those fries I used to get from the elementary school cafeteria. The hushpuppies are balls of fried perfection. The slaw has the perfect balance of vinegar and mayo, not too runny either. The fried chicken is out of this world. Well seasoned and crispy skin encasing succulent, juicy, and tender meat. It's been awhile since I've had it so when we ordered it the other week I was temporarily transported back to fried chicken heaven. My parents love their gizzards.  We used to only get Price's on specially occasions and settle for Bojangles the rest of the time, but now my brother lives within walking distance from it. In fact you can see Price's from the entrance of his condo building. So dangerous but so convenient so we can scope out the line before heading over.",

    "text": "After reading all the raves and talking to a few locals, I put Price's on my hit list and felt I had a slam dunk for some down home Carolina mom and pop fried chicken.  So I got there on a rainy Wednesday at 11:30 AM to beat the lunch rush. Great, no lines, a no frills civil rights era looking store interior and 5 eager cashiers ready to take my order. I ordered the 4 piece or half chicken dinner, a side order of livers, and sweet tea. There was a short wait for the livers.   When I was called to get my prized white box of chicken, I felt like my number came up for a bingo jackpot. Could not wait to sink my teeth into what may be the best fried chicken I've ever eaten in my life.    Got into my car with rock star parking right in front of the store (no customer tables and chairs) and carefully arranged my food around the center stick, dash, and passenger seat. Finally the moment of truth - I picked up a leg and bit into it.... I then closed my eyes in disbelief. I almost cried.   IT WAS COLD. IT WAS NOT CRUNCHY. IT WAS PRE COOKED FRIED CHICKEN. AND TASTE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD BLOW YOU AWAY.   Now, I recall all the chicken parts were sitting in separate piles waiting to be assebled into boxes to tame the crowd. The only thing I saw that was actually cooking, that hit the hot grease in the row of deep fryers, were my chicken livers.   But I will say the livers, tater rounds, hush puppies, and slaw was pretty good. They do a brisk business as many people were in and out with their white boxes of chicken. i JUST DON'T GET IT.",

It was not too greasy and super crispy fried skins.  Although it was a tad salty and not as juicy as I wish it would be.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this first meal in Charlotte.  But I'm comparing it to some other fried chicken spots where the juice runs down your chin at each bite.  The sweet tea was very refreshing.

It can get a bit overwhelming trying to read the menu and decide what you want while you have 20 people waiting behind you. Oh yeah, CASH ONLY!  The sweet tea is PHENOMENAL. I can't even put to words how good it is. In fact, it's actually ruined sweet tea for me -- anytime I have sweet tea all my mind can process is how it's not even close to being as good as the sweet tea at Price's.

The whole experience was pretty quick with minimal waiting time. Had to rummage up the dollars I had in my wallet since it was cash only. Luckily had a few dollars left over to help out my friend.   The box was filled and the chicken smelled delicious. If only it tasted that way. There was an odd taste to the chicken which was almost like soap. It wasn't a deal breaker and was still edible, but that wasn't the only problem. The chicken first of all is way to bland, where is the flavor! Secondly, it tasted like it was probably left out for a while. I heard some people complain that it was too greasy, but I don't mind me so artery clogging liquid. The chicken king right down the street from me is a much better choice. Popeye's is still leagues above this. Maybe I'll give it another shot due to its reputation, but I don't have high hopes.",

And tater tots were heavily fried with a lot of residual oil and a little over crispy, and the hush puppies had very little flavor other than oil and bread.  Because it's not an eat in establishment, plan to eat nearby, either in your car, or in a nearby park. I think the chicken may have been improved upon had we eaten it a little sooner. We drove around for about 10 minutes trying to find a shady spot to eat. But I have to say, I've had great fried chicken, good fried chicken, and okay fried chicken.

The fish sandwich is impressive, filled with multiple fillets of batter fried perch. Tartar sauce is extra. The fish was tender and delicious. The fries were fairly standard.

I ordered a fish sandwich with hushpuppies.   So first off, the fish is extremely tasty. It is fried to crisp perfection and I'd be willing to bet that they put butter or some kind of savory butter flavor in all the grease. My friend had the chicken wing sandwich, which is a confusing meal because it's 3 chicken wings in between a bun. How can I eat it as a sandwich without biting into bone and gristle?While this is confusing, I don't care because plenty of southern dishes are confusing. Literally WHO came up with potato salad????  JESUS... the iced tea was just PERFECT. It was just the right amount of sweetness!  Now, I have to dock a star from y'all because the hushpuppies were large and looked so good, but they tasted like cornmeal with very little flavor. Y'all gotta start throwing some butter and some type of sweetener (honey?) in the batter.   Hushpuppies were a bit disappointing, but have sooooo much potential. I may order them again and just bring my own honey butter.",

    "text": "Let me start with something controversial - I think their fried chicken is overrated. Don't get me wrong, I think it's good but I don't think it is the best ever (I'd give the chicken three stars by itself). My husband, however, really likes it and gets a quarter dark every time. The most recent time we were there, they must've noticed the thigh was small so they threw in a second one. He appreciated that (because let's be honest- the thigh is the best piece). I miss the tater tots they had years ago but that isn't a deal breaker. I tried some of my husband's cole slaw and it was good. I tried some of his potato salad and it was just okay.   So with that being said, I give Prices four stars based on their fish sandwich. It is absolutely delicious! They stack a ton of fish in there (so much that I always give a huge piece of it to my husband for him to eat with his chicken). It's hot and flavorful. I'd definitely recommend it.   I get why it's a Charlotte staple. No frills. Southern staples. Nice folks working there and all types of people coming through the front door. Is it the best place in the entire world? No. Is it worth a visit? Definitely.",

I walked up to the counter not really sure what I wanted and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I ordered 1/4 chicken white meat dinner plate, which came with a roll, hush puppies, and French fries. I thought the chicken was good- it was hot and crispy. The hush puppies were a little bland and dense but I think that may be the standard. Overall tasty, cheap lunch, but after reading more reviews I wish I would have went with the fish sandwich! The sweet tea was also a must for me.",

He heads around back and does a hack job of parking, missing all the lines. we walk around to the front to get inside with a half dozen other folks. I ask for the 4-wing dinner when it's my turn and mill about for a few minutes waiting for fries then exit with a fresh-to-order box lunch in a real box: fries is fries is fries... just don't wreck 'em and everybody is happy, same goes for hush puppies (golden brown with airy yellow centers), slaw (creamy and chopped (the impaled pickle is a nice touch)), and a dinner roll (because it's a dinner.) Wings are pretty meaty and of good quality; light breading but plenty of it. I'm not being contrarian but I just don't get it. It's fried chicken, it's good fried chicken, it's worth stopping in and buying the T-shirt even. It isn't what I'd call 500-mile fried chicken, but if you've got the time they have your bird, or fish, or shrimp :-\\",

    "text": "Remember that episode of Seinfeld with the \"soup natzi\"? I kind of felt like I was at that place but with a more friendly atmosphere but still an urgent impatience of the staff if you don't know what to order when it's your turn. It was slightly intimidating!   I knew I wanted chicken but I didn't want any sides really. Their menu didn't show any chicken only options and I never saw anyone leave without a full meal so I thought they didn't offer it. I ordered a small dark meat meal and a 3 wing sandwich so I could get the chicken pieces I wanted and not more than my husband and I could eat.   The chicken was good! Loved it! It had a thin crispy coating and really nice flavor. It was juicy and delicious. I love wings and their wings were small but three were plenty for me. My husband had the dark meat and he said the same thing about his thigh and leg.   Let's talk about the sides: coleslaw had a flavor we both thought was not good. We each took one bite and put it to the side. The bun/roll was just cheap white bread. We wish it had been a potato roll or something but after one bite we discarded it too. The fries were hot but just a frozen crinkle cut product so not really worth the calories IMO.    Another fact: this place only serves UNsweet tea. Certainly odd for a southern chicken place.  If you go, go for the chicken and enjoy the flavors of it but be prepared to be underwhelmed with the sides that come with it.",

It was a little confusing figuring out the ordering system, but once inside there are four cashiers and each one is a separate line-- so jump in the shortest one. Cash only and have your order planned out. You pay, then they bring your food pretty quickly.   I ordered the dark meat dinner plate ($6.95). Came with two drum sticks, one thigh, crinkle cut fries, two hush puppies, cole slaw, and a dinner roll. Also napkins, a plastic fork, and one packet of ketchup.   The hush puppies, fried chicken, and cole slaw were my favorite things on the plate. The dinner roll was dry and the fries were nothing special. It's a solid meal for the price.  Note: everyone said the sweet tea is REALLY SWEET and there are bones in the chicken sandwich",

    "text": "A fellow Yelper checked in last week here and I commented that I needed to go before the year was over. So two days ago - I decided that would be that day. I went on a lunch break during work.   All the road parking was taken up so I went to park in the back lot of Price's chicken coop. I noticed it was mostly empty. There was a gentleman walking back to his car. But didn't think too much of it.   I walk to the front of the building and there is a sign that they are closed until next year. Literally was hoping it was a joke or something because I hadn't been to Price's in a while and was really looking forward to it. So I'm peering in the window and just standing there for a few moments.   Not sure where to go - I stepped to the side and made a phone call. Trying to figure out what to do for lunch now.   Literally I'm gone from car for 7-10 minutes and I walk back to the lot and my car is gone. Long story short- it was towed.   So why am I leaving a one star review because my car was towed?   Because I was visiting Price's chicken coop and parked in their lot. I had no idea they were closed for the season.   The towing company said Mr.Price called them. That he has cameras everywhere. I asked when did he call? When I was walking to his establishment? No? Maybe when I was standing in front of the building reading the sign? Oh no? Maybe it was when I was the phone?   The length of time I was out of my car - means that they immediately towed my car as soon as I stepped out of the vehicle. Predator towing.   And if Prices chicken coop hired these folks to cover that lot - then that's bad business. I had to pay $175 to visit an establishment that turns out what closed.   I will not go back. Ever.",

Fiance and I both ordered dinners, mine dark meat, his white.   1. Dinners come with fries, hush puppies and slaw. You can sub out any and opt to get extra of something else. I opted for no slaw extra hush puppies while the man opted for extra fries no slaw. I will be asking for extra fries next time. They are crinkle fries- I'm normally not a huge fan but these were perfect! Crispy exterior but soft on the inside. Will ask for tartar sauce next time for my hush puppies. NOM.   2. The chicken. Jam packed with flavor! I don't know how they do it but the flavor didn't just come from the skin...it was in the meat itself. You don't need any sauce for this stuff! I of course made a hot sauce concoction because I have a serious addiction to spice.   TL;DL French fries are bomb. Chicken is NOMZ. Go at awkward times for no wait.",

Outside of that, the customer service was top notch with workers acknowledging regulars on a first name basis. Customers were also very patient, important for such a popular food spot with so much foot traffic. No seating here so we just hit some chairs on the railway. I do wish their were closer options for seating but maybe that's soon to come from the City. Two thumbs up !",

You almost feel like you are stepping into the past when you walk through the doors.       They only take cash, so come prepared.  Fried chicken is offered by the piece, 1/4 chicken, 1/2 chicken and whole chicken (white, dark or mixed meat).  They do offer a few sides such as hush puppies and slaw.       The chicken is SO GOOD, the skin/breading is crunchy and flavorful, the chicken is hot and juicy..... Popeyes and Bojangles don't even compare.  If you've never been to Price's Chicken Coop make sure you stop I on your next visit to South End!",

    "text": "Price's Chicken Coop. This place is a Charlotte staple. However, their 4 star average is fair and right. The chicken is good. Not the best, but you won't be disappointed. What is great is that you get that chicken with fries, roll and hush puppies.  Yeah, the chicken breading can be inconsistent, but that is a consequence of making if like your grandmother did. It's old school. They don't take cards, only cash, which can suck for millennials, but we also love vintage. This is as vintage as you get. Assembly line, old school box and the additional options of potato salad or hand pies or sweet potato pies makes you feel like you are at a cookout. It's tasty, not pretentious, and simple. Besides the chicken, my wife believes they do have the best fried fish sandwiches. They have gizzards which is comforting to a boy from the country. Their are some cons; only taking cash, is one, however, this is a place you truly have to try as a Charlottean or tourist.",

    "text": "There's an old story that still circles about a man who tried to rob Price's Chicken Coop. It was a typical busy lunch time and business was good, lines were long. He walked in brandishing a gun and demanded money from the registers. Before he could react one of the men running the counter drew one of his own and shot the would be caper down before calmly saying \"next please\". Weather there is any truth to this tale we may never know but once you step inside Price's and realize the neighborhood it which it sits was once full of grit, you want to believe.   This is old Charlotte, tried and True. Don't expect to pay with plastic or eat with anything other than the cheapest plastic utensils available. In fact, the only thing you would need them for is the slaw, which is good but that's not why we're here. Get some baby wipes together because those thin napkins won't help get that grease off your fingers. Oh and take your box and get out of the way. Drive home if you dare, the smell will have you getting crumbs on your alcantara in no time. Do yourself a favor and go on a nice day and use the built in table on the back of your car.   First time? go for the quarter dark, tea. If you like white meat get the wings box. Nothing against the breast cut but the meat to coating ratio favors the meat a bit much for my tastes. Shrimp box is amazing, like your favorite Calabash place but with better batter. If you want a huge card stock rectangle full of iron rich nuggets, they have that too. Chicken sandwich is an old style idea, let the customer pull the meat off and stack it on the white bread roll themselves. Sides? I dig the Kennedy piece tots and the hush puppies just fine but after all they are just sides.   Stop by the south side with a twenty and a smile, you won't regret it!",

And yep, I think that they were right! The marinated chicken is seasoned just right, breaded with crispy deliciousness, and deep fat fried in a marvelous taste producing peanut oil. The results were simply yum! A half chicken dinner is reasonably priced at just over $10 and comes with potato rounds, Cole slaw, and just about perfect hush puppies. Now, all of that deep fried goodness may not be really good for you, but you could just consider a salad for dinner while you enjoy chicken bliss for lunch!  Two warnings before you rush over...they accept cold hard cash only...keep your cards in your wallet. Second, the food comes in a box to go. You will have to be patient a little while longer to enjoy the food in another location. Please consider the safety of all around you and do not scarf down the chicken and drive. Enjoy the bird responsibly!",

I had the 1/4 chicken dark meat meal. Really good chicken. They don't do fake/over processed  chicken, no boneless anything.

Of course I'm talking about their lunch rush. You can go off-peak hours and receive a little more graciousness from everyone.   I usually get the 1/2 chicken combo and call it a day. It'll feed you plenty and probably  someone else if you have a small appetite. Great chicken that doesn't have thick layers of breading. Just enough to give you that crisp crunch before sinking your teeth into the moist seasoned chicken. No greasy aftertaste either. Just simple fried chicken and sides that are plenty enough.  They serve buckets also if you want to come with your family. HOWEVER, do not expect any seating in the place. It's a get your food and get out kind of establishment. You'll usually see business men chomping away next to a construction worker. My kind of place. No fancy decor or titles, just food.   Go here and not KFC, you'll thank them.",

Luckily, I located this small, hidden gem situated in South End on the first shot.   Coming from the north, there's not much options out there besides your typical KFC and Popeyes.  And to be quite frank, I am not usually a huge \"Fried Food Person\", but I swear there is something special that Price's does to their chicken.  Whether its injecting it with some type of marinade or coating the entire batch with crack, every bite is memorable.  Juicy inside and fried to the perfect crisp.     Now lets talk about the service.  I have to admit...first time coming in with no cash, I was chewed out from one of the old southerners in the front counter.  Make sure you bring cash!  And make sure you withdraw your money quick, otherwise you will be the last in line (high customer flow).        Overall, Price's Chicken Coop is a one-of-a-kind hole in the wall with a mix of a NYC attitude/service.  Their quick and get to the point.  Best of all, the food is amazing.    P.S: Don't forget to buy their legendary sweet tea.  It's a perfect compliment with the meal after downing all that grease and delicious goodness.",

The cook process and customer counter operation clearly hasn't changed a bit in 60 years or more of prosperous business.   I go on rare occasions for the experience, not the food. The chicken quality and fry quality is OK, but the taste is pretty bland across the board, and there's not a healthy bite on the entire menu. What impresses me most is how clean and efficient the place is - like a hospital operating room... that fries chicken.",

Luckily the good mostly outweighs the bad and I'd never turn down a plate from Price's. However, it's not quite worth the hype to break my neck to get over there to get a taste of their fried bird. It's a no frills place and that's fine with me as long as the food is great, I always get the 1/4 white plate and just remember to stop by the ATM before you visit because it's cash only which I can respect for a place that's been around as long as the coop but it would be nice if they offered some type of card service. The chicken to me is good, but not great. The give you a healthy portion and the skin is yummy and seasoned just right for me, but when you get down to the meat it just felt kinda on the dry side to the point I kinda lost interests in what I was eating. They throw in a bunch of sides but it's just sort of an overload of bread and starch (especially the overkill hashbrowns) Hushpuppies are decent, don't really care for coleslaw much and the roll is nothing special. All and all, it's a good place for some solid throwback style chicken, but not the best chicken around by any means.",

I would get a chicken sandwich and of course some sweet tea and eat in the car with my grandparents. As I got older, I started to enjoy my trips to Price's more and more. Now that I'm an adult, I have seen Price's famous chicken in Bon Appetit magazine and the long lines waiting to get some chicken and sweet tea. Being a native Charlottean, I have a special place in my heart for Charlotte landmarks such as Price's. In addition to it being a Charlotte landmark, the food is cheap and delicious. So what if you have to take your food outside or in your car to eat? Its all part of the Price's experience. The hushpuppies, sweet tea, and chicken are delicious and worth the wait and money. The hushpuppies are big and flavorful. The chicken is moist and succulent. The sweet tea is sweet but not too sweet. The fish and shrimp are also really good. Make sure to bring cash since they do not take cards and be prepared to wait in line.",

Ezell's is tasty, especially the spicy chicken...one bite of Price's and this will be one of her 'favorite things'. And the Colonel?!?! Yeah, along w/Duke basketball, this chicken gives Kentucky another reason to hate the Tar Heel State!   The chicken here...in one word...LEGIT!  Crispy, moist tender meat...yeah all of the adjectives you use to describe delicious fried chicken...multiply it all by 10!  The seasoning is spot on and it's consistently fried to perfection.   I was introduced to this bird a few months after I moved to Charlotte during an office potluck and all other fried chicken became an afterthought. This place has been around forever which means those fryers have had all of that time to season like a good cast iron skillet. I was told they fry in peanut oil, which is THE oil to fry with in the south, but the menu pictured on here says Veggie oil...big difference! I haven't lived in Charlotte since '06 so I really hope Price's hasn't sold out, like McDonald's after they quit adding beef tallow to their fries! This just means I'll have to go back and find out for myself. Pretty much every office gathering included this chicken, so I've had lots of experience w/Prices! I've taken many out of town guests to this place too for a perfect taste of True southern goodness and they all agree.   Do yourself a favor, next nice day in Charlotte pack small cooler, go to Price's and grab some of your favorite pieces, then head over East Blvd to Freedom Park for a picnic....ahhhh...Charlotte...",

The restaurant is subjectively charming and how can you not smile when you see people with shirts and ties sitting on the street curb eating chicken?   As we know there isn't anything special about fried chicken. Don't go buying fried chicken expecting some elaborate 20 step preparation process. Its just fried chicken. But fried chicken is comforting for everyone and always induces some type of nostalgia. Its a simple dish and Prices does it right: Moist, tastes like chicken and not overwhelmed with spices or anything, and lastly crispy batter.   They don't have real sides here. Just slaw, potato salad, taters and hush puppies. Although they offer other menu items, I only get chicken usually. Gizzards (yuck) are okay here too. =)   Thighs are just too greasy for me and breasts are too meaty. I like a 30% meat, 70% skin/batter mixture. So I'm a wing kinda guy and Price's has damn good crispy wings. My only complaint is that they chop off the wing tips. Yes I said it, I love wing tips! I'm still waiting for them to offer fried chicken skin. lol",

    "text": "What a bummer!   So I moved to Charlottes Historic Southend last week and knew right away that I had to try the ever-raved about Price's Chicken Coop.   I had high expectations- since Ive heard nothing but great things about this place.    I went this Saturday for lunch and ran into a crowd (expected) but I heard the line went fast- and just figured it was a good sign! After about 15 minutes of fully-expected wait time I made my selection the 1/4 lb white chicken meal complete with a roll, hushpuppies, and coleslaw for only $6!  I walked down to the Common Market to grab a drink and sit outside to eat my meal- (CM rocks by the way!) ...  When I actually ate my chicken I was more than disappointed. While I am never one to completely disregard an eating establishment because its a so-called hole in the wall (as this is) I do expect it to be sanitary. I immediately encountered a large black curly hair (that was definitely not mine) ... I was so disgusted- I put that piece in the garbage and tried to regain some of my appetite  and at least give the other piece a try. The chicken was fairly dry and definitely nothing special. There wasn't a lot of meat at all - and Ive had better chicken at KFC  which isn't saying much. ...The Coleslaw had no carrots or anything and was ok in flavor- basically a sweet watery-mayonnaise shredded cabbage mixture...nothing great. The highlight of the meal were the hushpuppies- which were perfect in every way.  I do feel like I will give this one more chance since everyone else claims it's so great...maybe I just had one outlying bad experience.",

However, the experience of going, ordering, and eating is enjoyable- you can watch them breading and cooking the chicken behind the counter!  We ordered two white chicken dinners- came with white meat, cole slaw, a roll, tater tots, and hush puppies. The chicken was not spiced according to my taste- a little bland, but was good and cruncy. The chicken was juicy inside. The cole slaw was full of pickles and did not complement the rest of the food well. The roll was store bought and the tater tots were the frozen kind. The hush puppies were good and homemade as far as I could tell.   Price's is take-out only, and only accepts cash. Plan ahead to have enough and a place to eat. Their online menu is outdated, and everything was about 25-50 cents more expensive than listed online. Be sure you know what you want when you arrive- ordering is fast paced and they rush you because it is a busy place!   I went to Price's with high expectations, but unfortunately was not thrilled. It is a good \"Southerrn\" meal, but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to go back.",

Price's Chicken Coop is a little intimidating for a newcomer (it can be VERY crowded) but just remember these two tips: bring cash and pick a line.  If you follow these two rules one of the sweet old ladies who work the registers will have you out of there in no time eating the best chicken of your life.  No, they don't take plastic (although there is an atm inside), and no, there is nowhere to sit.  Get over these two facts and you are on your way to a delicious meal of fried chicken and whatever sides you choose!  Right now they have a dark meat 'sandwich' meal (consists of 2 pieces of dark meat, slaw, and a roll)  for about 3 Dollars.  I usually grab that and go across the street to the grassy area and munch down a quick lunch or snack.  Everything I've ever had there is great...but their specialty is the fried chicken so I would strongly recommend that to new-comers.  The thing I love most about Price's Chicken Coop is that it brings people of all walks of life together with the common interest of good fried food.  The customers come from all walks of life and the employees and patrons are very friendly, even under the busiest of circumstances.",

The coop was closed  until next Tuesday! It would have been nice if they would have posted the holiday hours of operation.    now I guess we can go and visit are new grand baby . In Charlotte",

Price's fried chicken is SO good that I bite off the bones accidentally, and say aw f* it, i'll suck on it for the flavor.  I just keep repeating to myself, \"dont swallow the bones deanna, don't do it, it's not smart. resist deanna resist.\"  $4.21 for 2 pieces of fried chicken, slaw, and sweet tea with no ice. So cheap!!! I don't know why anyone would give this place less than 4 stars. I just don't.  After having tried fried chicken all over in Charlotte and supposedly good fried chicken in nyc by a chef that hails he's from the south -- holy crap people mess up fried chicken big time.  You know how sometimes it seems like asian girls are remarkably skinny and tiny?  Well price's fried chicken can change the skinny part for any asian girl.  You want to fatten up your asian girl? Price's fried chicken is the place to go. Tip 1 - get the dark meat.  Tip 2 - to prevent food coma, chicken sandwich (basically two pieces of fried chicken with bones in between 2 pieces of neglected buns. Tip 3 - get the dinner box for dinner with extra hush puppies",

Not much else to write, so I will provide you some rules about getting your food from Price's.  1) Bring Cash- No Credit, No Debit, No Checks, and No ATM nearby.  2) Don't Go on Sunday or Monday- they are closed.  3) Don't' be late. When they say they close at 6pm, they mean 6pm.  4) Don't talk on the Cell Phone when ordering- or you wont be ordering.  5)You don't eat AT Price's- there is nowhere to sit.  6) Don't bite into the chicken sandwich. It is a Price's tradition- your chicken still has the bones, even on the sandwich.   Last but not least, ENJOY the taste, the smell, and the atmosphere of this one-of-a-kind chicken joint!",

Third...the closing time is 6pm...however they stop cooking food for the customer about 15 minutes to 6pm (you can choose from what's left/all ready cooked if you want to buy something after 5:40 ish)...how do you close at 6pm and stop cooking your menu 15 minutes before 6?",

Been twice for take-out and was in and out in under five minutes both times. So here's the skinny:  The prices are ridiculous (in a good way). All that food and I never spend more than 8 bucks. Then again, not like this stuff is good for you. Oh how I wish it was. Anyway, the chicken is good--definitely doesn't match the hype but it hits the spot. Doesn't seem like it's seasoned with anything beyond salt (and it is quite salty) but it's fried to perfection, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Sides were disappointing. Potato salad was blah and hush puppies were decent at best. Iced tea, however, made up for it. Wish they came in different sized cups other than standard so I could order the super size. Best fried chicken in the Charlotte area? I'm not convinced but it's pretty high up there.",

I got the four wing dinner with hash browns, slaw, hush puppies and a roll. No substitutes allowed, whether you like it or not that's what you get.  The chicken was delicious, hot and crispy and just plain good.Actually it was better than I expected! The hash browns were also a big win for me...I only wish they threw more in my box! And at least two or three packets of ketchup...come on...ONE packet is not enough!!!   I didn't care for the slaw or hushpuppies but the chicken was good so heck yeah I'm a fan...

    "text": "There are places in this world that exist to do one thing and one thing only.  They know their limitations.  They don't overstep their bounds.  They keep it between the ditches.  Price's Chicken Coop is such a place.  They make fried chicken.    I heard a lot of hype about Charlotte, NC's Price's Chicken Coop - its been slinging fried chicken since 1962; its been featured on the Travel Channel;  its got a reputation as a go - to place.  So a friend from Charlotte took me there so I could give it a try.  I admit, expectations were high.   So let me get some housecleaning issues out of the way before I dive into the chicken.  First of all, its not a restaurant. It's a take-out joint.  They have no seating.  Second, bring cash - they don't accept plastic.    Now for the chicken.  I ordered gizzards.  When I see 'em, I order 'em.  And, because I had never been here before, and even though I have a predilection for dark meat, I wanted to try both white and dark, for the whole experience.  So my buddy and I ordered a whole bird, cut up.    It was late lunchtime and the place was bustling - no parking lot, just the curb.  We entered and ambled up to the counter and ordered.  The walls and ceilings were stained from years and years of deep frying.  It is a real dive (and that's not a bad thing).  Having opined on the chicken gizzard at length before, (see my review of Florence, SC's The Drive - In) I will only say that these gizzards were subpar; puny and overcooked, not made to order, and a total disappointment.  The whole chicken fried was just ok, mildly seasoned, a bit greasy.  The sides:  cole slaw, tots and hush puppies; nothing to write home about.  All and all the hype is much greater than the bite.",

I get horrible reaction from msg but wouldn't ever eat this chicken again even if it didn't have any in it.    Out of all the hood famous chicken spots this is the worst one.  Churches, chicken box and nana's soul food kitchen is WAY better. Popeyes in my opinion is even better.  I would even go to bojangels before coming here.  I gave it 2 stars because everyone was so nice when I was picking up the food.  I just can't believe this is the chicken spot that everyone talks about. I'm in disbelief:/",

This placed is AMAZING!  We came by around 2pm on a Saturday. There were suprisingly alot of people here. The place is a hole in the wall, take out only, CASH ONLY, place. We decided on the 1/2 mixed chicken dinner. And a sweet tea for me.....$0.89 ya'll!!!  The dinner came with hash brown rounds, a breast, a leg, a wing, a thigh, coleslaw, and a roll. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Super juicy and the crunchy skin was just delicious. The hash brown rounds were pretty good as well....maybe a bit more fried than I like. Didnt try the coleslaw (it's just not my thing) or the roll cause i was so engrossed in the chicken.  If you have a fried chicken craving, this is the place to go!",

    "text": "Anyone from New Orleans would understand & appreciate why making trips here when possible is good for the soul. (but probably not for your waistline!) They've taken frying chicken & fish (as well as other accessories to those two staples) to a high-art.   The fish sandwich, in my opinion - is a bargain at $4.80 - and tough to beat by any other fish sandwiches costing three times as much at fancy brewpubs. It's one of my all-time favorite things to eat in Charlotte.  The fried chicken is a 10 outa 10 - you can't get any better unless your grandmother makes it.   As other reviewers have probably noted, walk in  ready to order and don't be on mobile phone!  This institution is a neat experience and a must if you are passing through or live in the Charlotte area.",

The chicken was very tasty, with crispy skin and moist while being cooked perfectly.  I enjoyed the potato rounds but felt that the coleslaw had an odd flavor and the hush puppies were pretty bland.  The staff was friendly and efficient and my order was placed and packaged in under five minutes.  While I prefer Nashville style hot chicken, I would return if I was in town for some good ole southern fried chicken!",

A meaty chicken breast that was moist with a very crispy batter that wasn't so thick that it overwhelmed the chicken.  I got a two piece dinner, which came with a dinner roll, a small tub of cole slaw, some tater tots, some hushpuppies and the previously mentioned chicken - one wing and one breast. The tots were excellent. Not too greasy at all, but I was glad to have the one packet of ketchup for dipping.  This was a serious \"fried\" plate. If they could fry the cold slaw and the dinner roll, I'll bet they would have done so.  Note: This place is TAKE OUT ONLY. There is no dining area that I could see.",

There are no tables inside, and only a couple of chairs for waiting customers. The place is take-out only. There is no seating outside, but some people take their food and eat it across the street in a grassy little area, or to take home or back to work.  During my visit, there was a never ending stream of customers coming in and out.  The menu is simple and straight forward. Fried chicken, fried fish and several side options.  They also offer hamburgers, but I did not see anybody order those.  The chicken is super crisp and crunchy on the outside, and very moist and juicy on the inside. Juices were running down my hand with every piece.  The hush puppies were somewhat dry however. They were also lacking any deep corn flavor.  Price's is definitely worth a visit for their fried chicken. In fact, Jay Leno stopped by the place earlier in the year.",

The potato salad wasn't as good as mine (tee hee) but it was pretty good. And the customer service was on point!  The only negative comment I have is that the fish was a bit salty.

Like what others said, enter the store and jump into one of the lines once you know what you want. The folks there knows how to work fast to get you in and out ready to enjoy your chicken. My boyfriend and I shared a whole dark chicken (4 thighs and 2 legs) and a side of hush puppies. First off, the prices here are insane. I didn't know that you were still able to get a whole chicken for 10 bucks anywhere in town.  Ok, finally the food. The whole car ride home my boyfriend and I were dying to grab a taste of its crispy chicken because the smell was so strong. However, it was worth the wait. The skin was so crispy and you can taste that they use fresh oil for frying the chicken. The meat was tender and fell off the bone. The hush puppies were great as well, better than most places for sure.  Would I come back again? Most definitely. It's already on my to do list when I come back to Charlotte",

Most people got the box of fried chicken and ate it inside their cars in the parking lot.  There's a little park next door but it was too cold to eat outside.   ORDERING - get in line behind someone (I believe there are several lines) and then know what you want to order.  If you get a \"meal\" which is the default it comes with tater tots, cole slaw, hush puppies and then the chicken.  You can specify what type of chicken you want as well.    FOOD - Since it was two of us, we got 1 meal and then I just got a side of dark meat (thigh and drumstick).    The tater tots are interesting because they are shaped like coins, but are SO GOOD.  So crispy and tasty.    Cole slaw wasn't bad, maybe a little creamy.  Hush puppies were also very tasty.  Had a fried onion taste almost.  Fried chicken - it was just the way I like it, crispy, crunchy, and crumbly.  Not like a thick piece of fried skin that seems like a coating.  The chicken was moist, hot and flavorful.  Definitely the best I've had.  Overall, worth coming to try - make sure you take a look at the hours and be prepared to eat in your car.  So crispy and delicious.",

The dinner plates are a great deal with your choice of white or dark meat and they come with tater tots, hushpuppies and coleslaw in a handy cardboard carrying box.  Basically a perfect meal in a box.  They have exotic gizzards and chicken livers for those brought up on those parts, and they also have sandwiches.  They anxiouisly offer you southern sweet tea with your meal if you so desire, and they also have fried pies (apple and sweet potato that look delish).  I highly recommend this place, and will be back next time I'm working in town.  P.S. Not a far walk from Uptown, about 15 minutes straight up Tryon, and the chicken was still warm when I brought it back to my office.",

    "text": "I've lived in Charlotte 13 years, and I JUST made it to Price's. After all the hype I've heard, I've gotta say, I was a little let down. I mean, it was fine... but just fine.  The fella and I stopped in on a Saturday around 5:00 (they close at 6:00), and the place was fairly busy. We both got the 1/4 white chicken dinner, and the lady behind the counter was really friendly and helpful. It's probably good to know what you want when you go in there because there's a lot of hustle and bustle, and it could be a little overwhelming.  Since there's nowhere to sit, we walked back to our truck and popped out the tailgate - a pretty fun afternoon picnic! There were people sitting across the street in the grass, too.   So, the chicken was okay, but mine was a little dry. The tater tots were really good, but if you'd given me Bo Rounds, I'm not sure I could've told the difference. The hush puppies were pretty delicious, and I'm not a slaw eater, so I skipped that.  The fella is a slaw aficionado, and he said it was just ok - nothing to write home about. I got excited thinking the roll was one of those tasty yeast rolls, but it was pretty tasteless.  Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed. Maybe my expectations were too high or maybe it was an off day for them or maybe their reputation is better than their food.",

Like little chunks of deep fried erasers, gizzards don't really have any flavor, but a chewy rubbery texture.  At Price's, they're not bad, but not great either.  Which kinda sums up the rest of my experience.     Located in an up-and-coming area of Charlotte, Price's Chicken Coop stands out among all the hipster-ish boutiques popping up.  The shop was bustling when we arrived - people were coming in and out with white boxes.    I wanted to love Price's.  I read most of the yelp reviews - the good and the bad and played Russian Roulette with my stomach.  I lost.    The smallest portion size, which is 1/4 of the bird, or about four pieces, is enough for two people.  Coleslaw was forgettable and the tator tots were lukewarm.  The breading (the most critical part) was flavorless with no seasoning or salt.",

The first bite was hard like it had been over cooked. Midway through the sandwich I felt something in my mouth while chewing. It was a bone. Who has a fish sandwich with bones in it. On a positive note, the tater rounds are very good. They remind me of Hardees hash browns. I'm not sure that I will be back here again.",

So when I let my \"gastronomical\" hair down, it's for something over-the-top. Elvis sandwiches, cheesecakes-I like them all with a little less guilt than normal.  When the opportunity came up to take my brother for a proper fried chicken, I was all ears and tastebuds. Price's is as much about the history and environment as it is about the clucking. The whole store is the size of a post office, and lines are more of a clump. The menus are scrawled in Sharpie, and there's other personal reminders by the counter. \"We reserve the right to refund your order if you use your cell phone in line.\" \"Cash only.\" It's a little bit like a Seinfeld episode, but the cashiers are not stern socialists.  I handed over $10 for a sweet tea and a cardboard box of the namesake \"chicken dinner:\" 1/4 white fried chicken, \"tater\" rounds, \"slaw,\" cornbread hushpuppies, a roll, with a fork/ketchup/salt bundle packaged like a military ration kit. And loose change.  The chicken's looks, sounds, and tastes good enough to be labeled \"Charlotte's best.\" It peels right off of the bone and the skin crackles like a fire. The sides make it a feast-to-go. The hushpuppies were undoubtedly the second best part.  There are no seating areas inside the building, and it gets packed with customers and hurried cooks. It's kind of like the Apple Store of fried chicken: lots of business and traffic, but you'll get your chicken and be more than pleased with it.  In fact, you may want it all the time.",

Total less than $30. The counter man teased me about my hand motions when ordering the tea -- i couldn't decide on a cup or a 1/2 gallon.  The atmosphere of this place is worth almost as much as the chicken.  ALMOST. I love parking on the street, standing in line, hearing them yell \"Two Birds!\", and getting my fresh white box of chicken with grease stains. It's an experience.  But better than the experience is the delicious crispiness of the chicken, so juicy on the inside. It can't be beat in Charlotte, as far as I can tell.   I put my chickens in their boxes in a cooler and drove out to northern Union County, where I dropped one of with a friend and carried the other to another friend's house. We had friend chicken for a late lunch, still warm and crispy, with my friend's farm-canned green beans. I drank that cup of lemony sweet tea before I'd made it out to where Albemarle Road meets Lawyers Road, and it was delicious. A rare treat for me.  Eat Price's chicken every chance you get, but go to the counter and get it yourself for the full experience!",

My BP looks like a cricket score, no kidding... one would be surprised.  Because of that and my desire to get in better health I have gone to extremes to try to live beyond 65 years of age... so I usually avoid these kinds of joints.  I ended up lost within myself, using my teeth to rip off parts of chicken in between catch breaths.  I was so happy. I sat in the car, hunched over my armrest, feeling like the Buddha. Honest, I didn't stop eating until it was gone, like a good boy. I ordered the 1/4 white meat chicken dinner, which included two wings and a thigh and sides documented by other Yelpers.  Next time I'm going all dark, baby.    Oh, and there will be a next time because I know I won't eat fried chicken again until I can come back here. $7.85 for a full dinner and a tea without ice, including tax. How do they do that? (Their tea was the best I've had on this particular trip, but I'm damn sick of the sweet tea. Northern boy for life, no matter where I go).  Yep - no seating and friendly but insistent and brisk service.  My only wish was that I got more than two hushpuppies.  Please give me more hushpuppies instead of 300 taters!  5 stars is characterized by Yelp as \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" For me, this epitomizes Price's Chicken Coop.  It's apparently been there forever, nothing's ever changed (except for their zealous hatred of mobile phones, changing with the times, but in an ornery way!), places like this are still around but are evaporating in America.  Their fried chicken is simple and awesome.    Best fried chicken I've ever had.  If someone's got better - you better step up to get your rep up, player!!  The ordering fiasco and unwritten house ethics are a treat. I'm asking, please, go appreciate these sorts of places.  You'll wish you did when these places go away... and as a mere visitor to Charlotte, I say long live Price's Chicken Coop.",

Coming in and trying them for the first time I really saw little to get excited about. You 'green' tasting cole slaw, fried tater tot disks, a roll, and good fried hush puppies, then your choice of meat. The chicken apparently the premier meat.  Well, the chicken, not much flavor, and my breast meat was bad, too dry, way too dry. Honestly I've had better, moister chicken breast at BoJangles and Golden Corral. The tater tots are, well, tater tots. The coleslaw, often you find coleslaw that has a 'green' or raw taste, I've had worse, the slaw had a slight raw taste and was just ok, again, one notch above bland that even the single dill chip on top couldn't salvage. Let me finish with, they are average, not great, not terrible, except terrible dry breast, they should cook breast separately so they can get it out sooner, chicken breast is done ten degrees sooner then dark. Over cooking is the single cause of dry breast meat. Also, for what's it's worth all the fried food wasn't greasy and that by itself it a super positive.",

The lines can be long and overwhelming, particularly on sweltering summer days, but once you get your cardboard box filled with fried chicken and sides, it's worth it.   Know what you want before you get up to the counter and have cash ready. They don't take plastic. Also, there's no where to eat at Price's. You'll likely be tempted to start eating the greasy meal in your car.",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE Price's Chicken Coop!   I was born and raised in the south, which means that I know good fried chicken and Price's Chicken Coop is the best fried chicken I've ever had. If you don't believe me then just try it out and let me know what you think. Oh and just so you are ready for the fried chicken extravaganza, let me give you a some tips for a successful trip to Price's.  Tip 1: Price's only takes cash...seriously. There's an ATM in the restaurant in case you forget to bring cash. Tip 2: Be prepared to wait. During the typical lunch hour the lines have been known to go out the door, so don't be surprised if you experience the same thing.  Tip 3: There is NO seating...NONE. Luckily there are many locations (such as the Bojangles down the street) that are ok with you eating Price's there as long as you purchase something. I recommend getting a side at the location of your choice because Price's is known simply for it's chicken...there are other sides, but you come for the chicken.  Tip 4: Price's makes a set amount of chicken a day and once they run out of something then there is no more (one night I went around 5:45 pm, right before it closed, and all they had left was wings).  Tip 5: It's closed on Sundays and trust me, after your first taste of Price's you will be craving it on Sundays just like you crave Chick-fil-a. Tip 6: Be prepared to enjoy the best fried chicken you've ever tasted!  Now that I've prepared you for your experience to Price's, let me tell you why it's so amazing. The breading of the chicken is to die for! It's crispy, golden brown, and seasoned to perfection. Then after you get over the awesomeness of the breading you get to the actual chicken, which is so tender, juicy, and flavorful that you will wonder how Price's makes such fantastic chicken and how you've lived so long without it!   So if you want the best fried chicken you've ever tasted then you must go to Price's Chicken Coop. The location is very small and if you blink you'll miss it, but once you make the initial visit you will be very happy that you stopped in and you will be counting down the days to your next visit.",

    "text": "I finally got around to trying Price's Chicken Coop.  I made it there on a Thursday about 5:45 which 15 minutes before they close.  The cliffs note version: Cash only (there is an atm), carry out only.  I got the 1/2 chicken all white which was under $10 including tax.  It came with tater rounds, hush puppies, coleslaw and a roll.  This was all contained in a nice white square cardboard box with the menu/checklist of contents printed on the top.  It took me about 20 minutes to get home and the chicken was still pretty warm.  The crust was still crispy and the chicken was still moist.  With fried chicken your gonna have grease, but to me it seemed to be just about the right amount.  Is this the best chicken I've ever eaten?  No, but it rates up towards the top of my list. It reminded me of the pan fried chicken my grandmother used to make, which to me is the best chicken in the world.  Yes the tater rounds are frozen, but they were crispy and delicious to me.  And I have never, ever heard of tater rounds ever being anything but frozen.   The hush puppies were excellent.  The roll was standard packaged dinner roll. The slaw was diced, with not too much dressing and little bit of a bite.  Overall Price's Chicken Coop serves old school fried chicken that is some of the best I have had and to me the prices was very reasonable.  I haven't been in Charlotte too long, but I imagine if I had been here 15 or 30 years ago it would still be the same except for the prices and that is saying something.",
