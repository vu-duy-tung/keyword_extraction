The interior and exterior design of this place is nice and inviting. They have a better selection here and offers a hibachis grill station.   I do however feel that this place does not offer the same quality sushi as they do in Pineville, but they do however offer a BIGGER dish variety selection compare to the one in Pineville. All in all its a good place to eat at when you are in the mood for Chinese buffet.",

    "text": "China Buffet is a gorgeously appointed restaurant; almost too nice to be a buffet. I really wanted to take home the dining chairs. The Dining area was a bit to brightly lit for my tastes. The buffet itself is huge and so typical of the generic American/Chinese buffet standards. My initial reaction was that there was nothing I wanted to eat. Tons of American junk food, sushi made with surimi, basic Chinese dishes you see everywhere. A salad bar with some great looking mixed greens but nothing but pickles to put on it.  The usual Hibachi grill. Upon further investigation I found some steamed clams with a nice gingery sauce that was worth eating. Then I discovered the baby octopus! They look like little tiny - oh never mind - and were cooked with jalapenos. Tender and spicy, one of the best dishes I've ever had on a Chinese buffet. I ate the whole vat. Would definitely come back for the baby octopus, but with my luck they wouldn't have it that day.",

There was a fair selection, but my favorite was the hibachi.  I am not a big fan of buffets at all, but to me the hibachi makes all the difference.  You get the benefit of selecting exactly what you want, and also don't have your food sitting around in a steam tray.  They did seem to be regularly refilled, though, so I don't think that they were sitting around TOO long.  I'd return.",

How does China Buffet compare to other Chinese buffets in CA? Honestly, it wasn't too bad. Decor-wise, it trumps anything in CA: the decorations are spectacular, as the entire establishment is adorned with giant Chinese wood-cuttings, banners, and paintings. Even the table tops are Chinese paintings! Food-wise, it's comparable to those in CA. The salt/pepper frog legs were the clear winners, as the batter wasn't too fried, and it just salty enough. There were many octopus entrees and fish to eat, which is pretty cool. They even have a hibachi bar, where you choose your own toppings and they stir-fry it for you. As for noodle soups, choose from Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, or Japanese-style. Better yet, they give you scallops in your noodle dishes! Desserts: just stick to the ice cream. Everything else is so-so. Seems like a popular spot for birthday parties, as we could hear many celebrations during dinner. Chinese buffets in North Carolina? It's passable. Nothing crazy, but not as bad as I would have expected...",

While being on the pricey side, they have more variety than most Chinese buffets and the building has undergone a beautiful, and probably expensive renovation. They would get 4 stars if it weren't for a screw-up that tainted my view of them. A coworker and I ordered carryout and they gave me/charged me for a completely different item, giving me white rice instead of fried and no spring roll which came with the dish I ordered. I said the number of the item I ordered, not the dish, so the screw-up was solely on the cashier's end. She offered no apology, no discount (even though the item I was charged for and given was a dollar more expensive than what I ordered) and simply said \"is the white rice we already gave you okay?\" when I inquired about the fried rice I'd ordered. So on the service end, this place is lacking. I will continue going here for the buffet, but will surely never order carryout from here again.",

I'm a sucker for a good buffet once in a while, and although you definitely get what you pay for here, the place isn't too bad! You have your usual American/Chinese cuisine, but I was disappointed they didn't have oysters. The only thing worth negative mentioning is that they need cleaning staff (both on the buffet floor and restrooms) attending at all times. It gets a little dirty and messy FAST, and quick cleanliness in this type of business is extremely important.  All in all, if you're craving buffet food, I'd definitely give this place a shot!",

In another city maybe Saturday afternoon 10 miles is nothing but in Charlotte's traffic 10 miles seems like forever. By the time we got there I was so thankful it was buffet because I was very hungry. Well the place is huge, and the decoration is very interesting and I liked it. It was very busy and I saw a lot of Asian people which is a good sign. We didn't even sit I told our server water please and then ran to the food, They had a big selection of food, and all the trays were full and they seemed fresh. I had to be very careful while choosing what to eat because of my little one but it was easy with all the options they have. I was very satisfied and it is a Chinese buffet so lets keep real, the food was ok. But when you are hungry and you decide to go to a buffet then I don't expect great food. I just have to say that my husband love it but he loves food in general. He even made plans to take my dad there when he visit us from Nashville (those two are buffet lovers). So yes I will be back.",

The buffet features your standard food found in other Chinese buffets, chicken and beef dishes, a salad and desert bar, rice dishes, noodles, and sushi. There is even a Hibachi grill where you can have your food cooked to order. The buffet features American dishes such as pizza and macaroni and cheese as well. The food ranges from mediocre to decent. Some of the food I actually enjoyed, however some of the chicken dishes were bland and rubbery, probably due to being frozen. Another complaint is the choice of music, the restaurant plays modern radio music as we dined. I do not want to listen to Justin Bieber or Rap/Hip hop while I am eating. I suggest a more classical approach, or Chinese music, fitting of a CHINESE restaurant as it is more calming. Overall, this is one of the better Chinese buffets out there and for around $10 per person, you can fill up your stomach with passable food.",

    "text": "Fun atmosphere and decorations. The atmosphere is typical mainland china style. Kind of garish and over the top and showy. Nothing understated here. But it is a change of pace from the typical generic styling you usually see. The name in chinese is not actually china buffet but rather summer palace which refers to an historic site north of beijing which is not necessarily a proud moment in chinese history but historic and a fabulous place to visit and on most tourist's list when in that area. The real summer palace is the definition of over the top. Anyways on to the food itself. The food is decent, you will most likely find at least 2-3 things that will satisfy you when you visit as they have a wide range of dishes. I will point out the highlights. First off, the hibachi grill is good, always, always get that first and they have scallops. The soup is another decent item. The rolls here are not worth much in my book and i always pass them up. The steamed fish is very good. One very unique item here is the frogs legs. How many chinese buffets serve frogs legs every day? In my opinion, this is not the best chinese buffet in the area but it has the most variety and noisy typical \"chinese\" atmosphere. Which is a good thing when you are in the mood, if not you may find it too noisy which I sometimes do. I do enjoy coming here for lunch and sometimes dinner.",

Not only was there a lot of the normal fruit (pineapple, watermelon, cantaloupe), it was extra ripe. Expertly picked. I couldn't get enough  They also had sauteed bok choy, which I'm a huge fan of.

The egg drop had a fairly thick consistency but turned out tasteless. The hot and sour was hot but not sour.  On to the seafood course. Crawfish rubbery, calamari the same and the steamed shrimp was overlooked. The fried courses of wings, fish and ribs were dry and rubbery. Next the mixed Chinese course with chicken and broccoli, noodles and fried rice all bland and soggy.

    "text": "This restaurant was a delightful surprise!  Our small group of weary travelers loved everything about it- from the beautiful decor to the unbelievable array of delicious buffet foods (shrimp, crab, fish, pork, beef and chicken fixed in countless ways) As if there wasn't enough choices, you can pick out the raw ingredients and have them hibachi stir-fry it right in front of you.  My son and I loved the very fresh fruits, sushi and scads of fresh ice cream choices as well as other sumptuous deserts.  I've eaten at a number of Chinese buffets and this one far surpasses anything I've ever eaten.  Even the picky grandkids were on board! Too bad we live so far away!",

Compared to other buffets around town, this one is just slightly below them - again, the price is a bit steep in comparison.  As for the food, there is a rather large selection.  However, the food was kind of bland.  I am not sure which item caused it, but I had an odd metallic taste in my mouth afterwards.  I would recommend looking elsewhere.  If you want sushi for about the same price but at a better value, try Ru San's in Charlotte.",

The food is the standard for what you would expect for a Chinese buffet, but what stands out is the selection. Sushi, a hibachi grill, and selected Chinese and American dishes are available. Nothing really stands out taste-wise. The food isn't bad, but nothing that is amazing. The price is reasonable for the amount of selection and the service was good.   I'll give this place another try in the future and hopefully the food will match the look of the place.",

Very modern and flashy, the interior soothes the eyes, as the great food soothes your pallet. Modestly priced at $10-11 per person for adults, there is an ample selection of hot, fresh food, as well as a Mongolian style buffet where you add ingredients for the chef to make you teriyaki, hibachi or garlic dishes while you watch. My family loves the vast selection of beef, chicken, fish and seafood dishes that align the 10 or so buffet servers. Hot food is brought out constantly, even when attendance is lacking. Our new favorite asian buffet!",

But the most unique feature to me was the soup bar and the desserts.  Mostly the soup.  You still have your typical soup section you normally see in Oriental buffets.  However, here you also have a specialty soup section with a cook who will pull ingredients out of containers and noodles that are cooking on strainers in water that he puts fresh in a bowl together.  Unfortunately, the special of the day, a duck-based soup, was completely eaten up by the time I came in, but there was a nice selection of options to choose from including whether I wanted it spicy or not.  It's a nice addition to the usual buffet selections that fits really well with the typical hibachi you find at some of the nicer buffets where you bring them fresh ingredients and they cook it on the grill for you while you wait.  Also the sushi was very flavorful, good quality \"buffet sushi\".  The fact that when I went they had more elaborate deserts like apple cobbler, which you don't typically find at most Asian buffets really means they might have a shot to appeal to a more wide variety of...your picky relatives.  You know the ones.",

Next time, I will take my office friends next time, hope they like it as well.  For such an amazing buffet, i would suggest them to raise the price to $13.99.  Thanks!",

The food is ok, but nothing really special and is definitely not a step above other Chinese buffets. I only give it two stars because our waitress was actually really nice and refilled our drinks very promptly. But if you are looking for good quality food, just go ahead and skip this one.",

They did a lot of cosmetic changes to the building structure (used to be a Cajun/Mardi Gras Place?) but it definitely has its share of finishes - really heavy looking copper doors and asian-esq statues flanking the doors.  We were seated pretty quickly and there was a pretty good lunch crowd already.  The place can accommodate a lot of people (parking... not so much... but there are signs for additional parking in the back).  Waitstaff was friendly and prompt with drink refills.  There is a good selection of food ranging from chicken nuggets, fries, to a full on hibachi grill were the food is cooked to order.   Sushi is also available, but I was a little disappointed since it looked like the sushi had been sitting out for a while...  I know it's hard to do a sushi buffet, but some of the rolls looked a little questionable and I stayed away for fear of later issues in my work day.  I was surprised at the price of the buffet 7.99 - so the price does seem right for what you get.  Would I come back... probably... but I can't really do buffets since I feel so miserable afterwards.  My favorite thing in there was the emergency exit door with the sign, \"EMERGENCY EXIT - ALARM WILL BE SOUND\"....  so we know the alarm will sound, or the alarm is good to go?  It gave me a little chuckle.",

The hibachi is popular, I didn't see many lining up for sushi. The buffet is a different story. I like the way the tables are laid out, even when they are crowded, there is enough room to walk around the tables.   So what's good? If you like chicken, the fajita is really good. The fried wings are good too, the drumettes are meaty and tasty. The s&p calamari is good if you get them fresh from the kitchen. I don't eat rice, but they have several to choose from. The selection on the weekend was different than what I saw on a weekday, and the meal was $2 more on Saturday. Otherwise, looked like the standard Chinese buffet offerings. If you can pack the food away (not in a doggy bag lol), probably a good choice if you are in the University area.",

Here are the frills that earned an extra star.   Noodle soup station. Pick your noodle style, pick your ingredients, pick your broth. Not the best I've ever had (no duck broth) but good variety of meat and seafood and the fresh herbs really make you forget you're at a buffet.   There were hibachi (pick your ingredients and they cook it up) and sushi stations, but I didn't try them.   Variety. All the normal dishes, a bunch of American dishes (for kids, I guess) and then variety. A few dim sum items; some more soup, and then seafood.  My son had his first octopus, crayfish, and frog legs.   Like the restaurant on the moon, no atmosphere. It's a Sunday night and more loud kids than a Chuck E Cheese.

We had not been to a Chinese buffet since moving to Charlotte and thought it was time to give it a go.  The place itself is pretty big but they have the tables in a congested area. They were pretty busy on our visit and constantly putting out freshly cooked food.  The variety of food for what we paid was good. They offered an ample amount of seafood options as well as chicken and beef.  For our Sunday visit, we paid $12.99 for adult and $4.99 for our child. Then additional charge of $1.69 per drink.   Also on our visit, they sure did have the heater on. Make you nice and hot so you don't stay so long. lol.  Food overall was okay. Not bad, not great - mediocre Americanized Chinese eats.",

The best thing they had were these fried corn nuggets! Corn nuggets at a Chinese restaurant! What a shame! I will never return to this restaurant and want to warn anyone of going! Please save your money!!! Take your kids somewhere else to eat some food worth eating! Left feeling unsatisfied!

Not too busy on a weekday at 11:45, there were plenty of tables. The food on the steam tables appeared pretty fresh (or at least as fresh as it can be in this situation). Pretty solid for straight carbs with noodles and rice dishes, the usual protein heavy trays were a bit lacking. You could probably do better if you wanted to do the hibachi where you can put in as much meat or chicken as you like. But where China Buffet seems to excel is over at the sushi section. A very good selection and not just the boring ones. There was mackerel. And more. Hey, I took a pic.  Service was good. My waiter was back and forth often to refill my water glass (you should really drink a lot of water at a Chinese buffet).  I liked it. I'll try and be back!",

For me, it fills a void that was left when Chen's Bistro buffet closed a few months ago in the same general vicinity.  Despite the uninspiring restaurant name, the interior of China Buffet is much nicer than most Chinese buffets.  Most amazing are the entrance with its huge copper doors (which could rival PF Chang's entrances) and host stand area with the oval blue sky and twinkling lights on the ceiling.   There are about 10-12 bars of hot and cold foods, plus a Mongolian BBQ area where a chef will cook up your selected meats, veggies, etc. fresh for you, a sushi bar, and a dessert bar with pastries and ice cream.  The food is all good, but nothing really stands out as truly exceptional.  For True sushi eaters, the sushi is just \"meh.\"  It's all very filling, though.  There are a lot of foods here for kids and other picky eaters, too.  The prices are very reasonable -- $8 for lunch and about $10 for dinner.    The buffet area and dining room are all very clean, although the dining room could use a few more separating walls for ambiance.  The decor is all really nice, though, and you can tell that they put a lot of money into the restaurant.    We'll definitely be going back occasionally on those really hungry lunch days.",

Obviously, someone decided they could make more money if they started using cheaper, lower quality food from their food supply company. It's a shame, but I would no longer recommend this place.

The place smells like fish and my hair and my clothes all have that funky smell. They don't have knives only forks and spoons. You have to push your food in your plate with your fingers or with what you find. Do not ask for water it also has that funky smell and it taste terrible. Definitely will not be coming  here again.",

I will say though that there was plenty of fruit. I've never been to a Chinese restaurant with so much fruit.   There is plenty of seafood, not that good in taste our quality, but a vast selection. Seems like for a Chinese restaurant, there are mostly Hispanics working there, that might be the reason for the poor quality and taste.   The desert selection is almost nonexistent except for the ice cream options, which are self-serve, but so difficult to access that its not even worth trying.  The hostesses are lazy, they rarely moved from the drink area, there was one male host that actually did bring water and was pleasant.   13.00 for food that is not good.

Secondly, the selection of food was *terrific*; really impressive when compared to other Chinese buffets - and it included a big variety of sushi, too.  Thirdly; everyone working there was *very* pleasant, plus our server (i.e., he brought & refilled our water glasses and he cleared our plates between visits to the buffet) was *very* attentive.  In addition, the interior of the restaurant is very attractive and spacious.  (Update on 4/14/14):  We also ate lunch (brunch) there today and it was another very positive experience.  The cost is much less on weekdays ($8.99 vs. $12.99, although even $12.99 is a bargain for the amount of delicious food).  The hostess recognized us, and she & our server were very sweet.",

    "text": "5 star buffet for sure.  If you are in the University area and are looking for a quick lunch for minimal cost, this is your spot.  China Buffet has become my go to place for lunch.  I have been here three times and each experience has been great.  I have gotten seated quickly and served a drink promptly.  My waiters have been attentive without being overbearing.  Their sushi bar is excellent!!!  It has lots of variety and special rolls.  Definitely the best sushi I have found in the University area.  Hibachi and Chinese buffet foods were great as well.  The only thing I have yet to try is their soup bar.  The soups look amazing, but I am usually to full to eat one.  Absolutely will try one next time.  I highly recommend the place.  You won't be disappointed.  Truly sorry it took me so long to find it as I have worked in the area for several years.",

Atmosphere is relaxing and festive: Beautifully lacquered wood everywhere and a wall-size waterfall. Kids like the fun statues when you walk in and really cool lighted ceiling. Lots to look at. It's kind of what you want in a Chinese buffet and the food is delicious. Try the butter fried shrimp, Asian green beans (cooked fully but still crisp), red bean filled sesame balls and just taste everything. The made to order soup station was not as good Tin Tin but we only tried one kind",

In a food service business it is very important to be able to provide great quality food along with great customer service in which values their customers. Tonight we recieved neither! At an all you can eat buffet there is always going to be food wasted. Rather it's at the hands of the customers or if it's the lack there of customers to consume the food during business hours. There should never be a point in time during business hours at a buffet where you continue to seat customers l, but STOP cooking food to fill the buffet because you don't want to over cook and waste food and expect customers to pay full price!! We requested additional food to eat, we waited over 30 minutes only to be told oh it came out but 50 to go orders came and took all the food! Only to then tell us you weren't putting more out and expect us to pay a $80 bill for 1 plate of cold food that was not desired. So called manager in the middrift shirt did not seem the least bit concerned with our happiness and continued to raise her voice and tell us what we she was NOT going to do! We are not crooks so we waited until she came up with a logical solution and if that meant sitting there inconveniencing her and her workers so be it! It's the principal and customer service that matters!",

    "text": "I hadn't been to a Buffet in years, & I was on the hunt two weeks ago. My husband & I finally stumbled upon this place. We were skeptical, however our hunger outweighed the skepticism. The parking was convenient this night because it was a weekday. Not many cars there, so we were hoping they were open. Upon walking up to the double doors, we were impressed. It felt like we were at a red carpet event opening the doors to a  luxury Chinese villa. The doors were huge, maybe about 10ft tall, & everything outside seem polished & nice. We stepped into the lobby area, where we were met with a Chinese dragon statue to the right, equally as tall as the doors. To the left, sat a claw machine & a few toy capsule vending machines. Another set of double doors led us inside to the hostess standing behind a desk, & off to the right a register checkout. The decor was eye catching. After being seated, we enjoyed a beautiful array of foods. There's definitely a little something there for everyone. The food was hot, well kept, organized & clean. Meaning there wasn't any dropped food or crumbs in sight. The wait staff didn't speak the best English, yet understood everything we discussed. They were sure to keep our drinks full & remember my son had a Dr. Pepper & not a Coke. They were also prompt to take our finished plates. One thing I like is that they didn't come take away our food prematurely. I hate when you look away for a split second & your last bite of broccoli is being carried away! The reason I didn't give this review one last star to make it a 5 star review is because of the dishes & silverware. The dishes looked worn, & the utensils looked clean & used at the same time. The way people scooped the ice cream didn't seem that sanitary, & you are to drop the ice cream scooper back into a puddle of cold running water in a dish, yuck! That night was fairly empty which concerned us. However we enjoyed our experience so much that we returned two weeks later for my mothers birthday. The place was crowded & that made us feel a lot better. The parking lot was horrible, parking in back of the restaurant did not make me feel comfortable. Thankfully there is a police station nearby & this restaurant is next to a bank, so police drive through regularly. The wait time for a Saturday evening was average. Maybe a 25-30min wait. There were a lot of celebrations going on with large parties. Seating was tight in some areas and just fine in others. There never seemed to be too many people at the buffet area at one time. We enjoyed the Sushi, & many bar options. The Hibachi I did not enjoy very much, & I had a lady ask me which meat was the beef & the chicken. Because of how the meat was sliced, you had to name the meat by color. The beef seemed to be a little darker in color so I guessed to her that the lighter meat was chicken. I will be returning as soon as possible. For those who prefer carryout, the prices are almost $6.00 per pound. I wouldn't dare! I hope you enjoy this restaurant as much as I did! Thx 4 reading!",

The dinner buffet is $13, and includes pretty good sushi, and a hibachi where you can pick out your meats and shrimp and vegetables, and have someone cook a full Japanese dinner for you.    I still can't get over it.  I got a soda, so it cost me $16 total, and I tipped $12 to a variety of people, and still made out like a bandit.    Realize that it won't be the best food you've ever eaten, but I don't think I've ever had a better value.",

Anyway, I will say that this place stays packed and is really not that bad.  They have lots to choose from.... fruit/salad, noodle/rice dishes, seafood, several meats including salmon, chicken, pork, beef, veggies, plus dessert station, sushi station, hibachi made to order station and soup/pho station, the choices are never ending for a great price.  I would say my favorites are the sushi station, the made to order pho station, and the made to order hibachi.",

    "text": "Judging: Location, Food Quality, (Food) Variety, Service, and Decor/etc. Feel free to skip to the food variety section   Location: It is near multiple lodging areas, stores, and other competing restaurants. The area is well kept and clean, and has a good customer inflow.  Decor: The store on the outside has a lovely dark granite (or something that looks like it, feel free to check yelp photos) entrance with pillars, and golden (colored) doors with statues to the side. In the inside there are small plants, and other side decorations depending on the season. There are color changing lights on the ceiling. There are 2 main main seating sections.   Service: It can depend on the server, but I would rate it 3.8. The servers are usually on task, but when it's busy or on slow Buisness hours they may refill your drinks/take your plates away slower. Overall the staff is nice, and if you need anything just be sure to ask.  (This isn't raining the hibachi staff, it changes/depends)   Food variety: The restaurant has a wide variety of seafood. (Some being very Asian/unique). Ex: Grilled Mackerel, Tilapia (bone in), Salmon, Crawfish, Octopus, Shrimp, and many others (they have boneless fish too). There also is a sushi bar (compared to another close by competitor \"Rivers\" (aka. [used to be] Tokyo) is made with higher quality ingredients (Doesn't fall apart as easily, and has good consistency). Though they may not have sashimi, they do have a good variety of flavors.  Ex: Fried tofu sushi (it kinda looks like a small boat), California rolls, etc (sushi is not my forte, personal opinion)   Don't worry they also have non-seafood options! Ex: Fried rice, Sesame chicken, hibachi chicken, Stir-fry veg+beef, Lo Mein (I think that's how it's spelled), etc. There are many others, but Hibachi! Hibachi= 3 different stir-fry flavors (teriyaki, hibachi, and something;there is a sign). Some of the thing you can get to have stir-fried is: (these aren't all, but most of them) -Raw: Beef, pork, shrimp -Uncooked: Noodles, etc  -Vegetables: Broccoli, Zucchini, Bean Sprouts, Onion,  -Etc: Pineapple, etc  They also have a soup section beside the Hibachi. They provide a large variety of fresh cooked soups, but there are some pre-made in the buffet. Ex; Egg Drop soup, others (I always get fresh cooked soup)  A few of the ingredients that they add with the (some varieties of) soup I dislike (tripe, etc), so just be sure to tell them clearly not to add it in. You also can choose what noodle you want. It is pretty much like pho, except you don't get a plate of vegetable on the side. They have a few unique styles of the soup: (some of these are special request) Duck, pho, udon, curry. (I'm pretty sure anyone can get curry, I usually get it.)  For kids there is Mac-n-cheese (I wouldn't say it's the best quality though), the seafood (shrimp) Alfredo is better. There are spring/egg rolls, fried shrimp, vegetables (broccoli w/ stir fried meats, green beans, etc), and a salad bar (probably gonna head to the dessert sections), Ice cream, sesame balls, regular/buffalo chicken wings, and etc.   Food Quality:  This varies so overall I rate it 4, it depends on what you get. Some foods are often not eaten like the Mac-n-cheese, so they aren't that fresh. While some foods run out as soon as they are put out (fried shrimp, sometimes crawfish). Some of the foods may have a too oily appeal on some, but not on others.  I usually get the green beans or some type of vegetable in all my plates, so it never gets to oily, and the soup (curry) can depend (sometimes to spicy, sometimes creamier than spicy; has coconut milk in it).   Overall, this is a great place & I would recommend this to my friends/coworkers/etc. I would go back & eat there, especially on cold days.   P.s: curry soup is a distinct taste, don't order it if you know you won't finish it. (Don't waste food, personal opinion). The main soup broth that they have isn't bad too, you can order it spicy.",
