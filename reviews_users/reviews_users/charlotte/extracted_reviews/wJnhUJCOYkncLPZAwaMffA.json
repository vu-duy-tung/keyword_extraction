Ordered food. 30 mins later after placed order inquired where is the food, waiter checked with the kitchen and informed that they did not even started preparing it. Apparently their explanation was that they are very busy. We had to leave and go to the pizza and pasta place across the street which was really great.  This restaurant should have put a sign in front of their entrance that they are not capable of managing multiple clients.",

On the trip through the lobby back to the entrance, you pass by some very nice architectural features of this building.  Don't forget to look it over.  Menu very complete with reasonable prices; I was expecting smallish portions, but they were generous - 8 pieces for a Koishi roll?  Pretty good.  Tried a couple selections, both were delicious.   Had to cut the Nigiri (my choice: yellowtail) in half to eat it.  Service was fast.  Good tip.  I'll be back.",

But don't give up looking for this place if you are looking because it's worth the stop.   We ordered the Philadelphia roll, which comes with smoked salmon. We don't really care for smoked salmon so we asked if they can make it with fresh salmon and they did. It was very fresh and great portion. I only wish I could have ordered more. We also ordered the spicy tuna, it had just the right hint of spice and the tuna was very fresh.   We also ordered the chicken pad thai - this dish was good but it had a bit too much sauce. I would have preferred it to be less soupy and a little more thick on the sauce side. The house fried rice was absolutely delicious. My mouth watered with every single bite, it was fresh and it wasn't overly greasy like in other places. This place is a must try. If I ever go back to Charlotte, I will definitely be back.",

I found the service to be quite attentive, and the menu selection excellent.  I keep it simple with sushi, and sometimes gauge how much I like it by the wasabi, which in this case was fresh and spicy, how I like it!  My only negative was that it was a little loud, so I wouldn't necessarily expect to have an intimate conversation when they are busy.  Good selection of cocktails, but I just had a beer (I can't remember if it was Sapporo or Ki-Rin).  My wife had plum wine.  Food presentation was gorgeous, too.  Will definitely hit this place again on our next trip to Charlotte.",

Unfortunately my friends were stuck in traffic so there were only two of us who made it in time for our seven o'clock reservation while everyone else arrived at 730. No dirty looks, no impatient badgering. Although maybe Charlotte people are just much kinder than the LA food scene that I'm used to.   The food was great. I wish I could remember the assortment of sushi we got but unfortunately all I remember was that everything was good. The only thing that is keeping this place from getting a five is the quality of the spicy tuna in one of the rolls was not great. Kind of chewy and stringy in parts. Definitely not the melt in your mouth tuna that can make sushi exceptional.   The place is small so wouldn't be surprised if you have to wait. The location is a little weird, inside what looks like an office building so the entrance doesn't face the street and there's no parking associated but that's uptown for you.",

I tried the mixed veggies with chicken($6.95) and it was ok, nothing special.....the veggies were nice and crisp and covered in a brown sauce with rice and spring roll....again very average.  On my next trip I tried the sushi combo(2 rolls and a salad $8.95).  I had the crunchy and spicy crab roll which were both very good including the salad with ginger dressing.  I'll definitely return for the sushi only.",

Each Pad Thai has its own flavor; if you're in the mood for sweet and a little tangy, you'll find it here. I got the Grasshopper and California rolls. They were of good size and very satisfying. Yummy.  It's a small to medium sized space, interior is all red, and a sushi bar that seats about 6 or 8. The noise level is a bit rowdy due to the tight quarters, background music, and talkative patrons...but not enough to deter you.  Service is friendly and they do multi-tasking well.   I'll be back the next time I'm Uptown and in the mood for noodles and rice!",

Definitely try the white tuna sashimi and salmon nigiri- two of our groups favorite choices of the evening. They have very inventive rolls- Upper Manhattan roll was awesome! No rice and was wrapped in cucumber. Overall all of the rolls had minimal rice as a filler and really emphasized the fish.   Everything was reasonably priced and came out fast and was presented beautifully. Will definitely go back next time I'm in town!",

I watched 2 girls behind the counter on thier phone, one girl waiting on tables and one girl clearing tables in between being going over to a customer standing at the counter area and rubbing his head. After 15 mins i called over someone who looked like the manger and asked why we still had not even recieved our water. Instead of saying let me get you that, he said let me see who your server is. I was with an officer in uniform so I'm now wondering if this is why everyone else got served but not us?We got up and left and will not be dining there again.",

The restaurant is tucked in a little corner on the side of a large corporate building, making it secluded and secretive-- who doesn't want to eat in a secret sushi bar?   All four of us comfortably sat in the middle of the restaurant, with a perfect view of the bar where our sushi was created. I ordered the ninja turtle cocktail to start, which was a tropical adventure, a True pre-dinner treat. As an appetizer I had the seaweed salad coupled with clam sushi. The seaweed salad was served in a petit glass bowl (posted pictures) and clams on a small sushi try-- both exquisite. Next I had my entree, which was an order of the salmon dream. The roll was moderately sized, but packed a punch. The roll was adorned with lapidary slabs of salmon and spicy mayo (my absolute favorite). This sushi could have quite possibly been the best salmon roll I've ever eaten.   If you're looking for an intimate date-night spot or even a small get together with friends, room 112 is the place to go.",

    "text": "When in-town for for a short while, I quickly pulled up Room 112, trusting the local Yelpers hoping that I could get some good sushi on the fly. I wasn't let down and had a good time.   - Average wait time - Free valet in the front - Located within a hotel - Prices are reasonable  The place was a bit hard to find at first since it's within a hotel and I'm not from the area. It took a while to get seated and service was slow but I arrived last minute during prime-time to grab a bite so it was expected. I left with a $50 bill for two people and for the quality was on-point.  All-in-all I chowed down on five rolls and an order of Sashimi. There were some high and low points with the meal but overall the quality was much higher than I've experienced in the South with Sushi. My wife always plays it safe and her food turned out better because it was more basic so beware. If you like to experiment with new food like I do, you might get something that is lacking.Fancy doesn't mean better.  I ordered a King tuna ($9.95) and Rainbow roll ($8.95) to start. You can;t really go wrong with either because of the amount of fish that's slammed together. The King Tuna had a dabble of sauce on top which was supposed to be all of the flavor you get, but really didn't do much to add to the roll but serve as eye candy.  I followed up with some Smoked salmon sashimi ($4.25) and a Shrimp hand roll ($4.95) which is always a winner as long as the fish is fresh. I would have liked to order some more sashimi since this was so delicious. Fresh salmon just melts on your tongue like butter!  My wife went for the Crunchy Cali roll ($7.95) and Super Crunchy Roll ($9.95) which are common staples in the American sushi restaurant. There is not much to say here other than you're playing it safe and don't expect and explosion of flavor.  When eating at Room 112 you're getting the typical restaurant-in-a-hotel prices in a nice setting with reasonable food and service. If you live in the city or are just dropping by this place is worth a try.",

I again sat at the sushi bar. I was given a menu & a ginger ale. I had to ask for the ginger ale as my waitress wasn't there. The waitress I did get was terrible. It took her 10 minutes to take my order & I had to get her attention by getting another server involved.   The sushi itself was delicious. I ordered salmon, yellowtail, white tuna & scallop. I also ordered a passion roll. The passion roll had an interesting texture due to being wrapped in soy paper versus rice. Unfortunately it had no flavor whatsoever. I was looking forward to the roll based on the comments of other Yelpers. What a shame. The waitress asked if I wanted a refill on my drink when I had two pieces of sushi left on my plate. Instead I asked her for the check. Lunch was filling but it wasn't as good a time as the previous couple of days were. The three stars are for the sushi only.",

Lunch was ready within 15 minutes each time, and very fresh & warm. The Kung Pao shrimp was not very spicy, so if you're a fan of eye-watering goodness, ask for extra spice. The spicy salmon roll and hand roll were good quality. The eel roll was also tasty.  i will go back - and will check out the evening vibe sometime. Several of the bar drinks sound yummy, and their tiny, warm space would give good ambiance for a night out with the girls.",

    "text": "Either the People in Charlotte have never experienced good food, or there is some serious brainwashing going on if Room 112 has more than a 1 star rating.  Let me make this clear, I went to this dump masked as a quasi-modern restaurant hoping to get some good food. I went with 2 other people, let me add this- we were all very hungry.   The appetizers were O.K., in retrospect to entree. The fish (tuna for both apps)could have had a nice color, but  it was decent.  The entree was a DISASTER!  All 3 were.  The Duck- was beyond dry and rubbery. It was inedible. A child without any culinary experience could probably tell that this dish would have been a disgrace if it went out. Lo and behold it went out! AVOID THE DUCK at all costs. Let me add that I specified that I would like the chef to watch the duck, specifically asking for the duck not to  be dry.  The Sea Bass, Felt like a discombobulated mess of imitation fish and fake soy. Some parts would not even cut. The glaze on the fish was equivalent to rotting ginger and orange. YUCK. Kikkoman makes better products, and theirs are superiorly inferior to what Asian cuisine is/ should be!  Let me also state the veggies that came with the above two dishes, felt like limp lifeless microwaved steamers, with a tad of nothingness sprinkled over them.  Also what establishment serves white rice, over Jasmine rice. A cheap- horrible one!!!!  The final dish was sesame chicken. This was basically the worst dinner chicken fingers you've ever had, ten times worse and stale! And some sauce on the side.  The presentation is eh.  I would fire their chefs and their staff and start anew.  We have small dives/dumps back in NY, that blow this food away, and your bill will amount to 35.00 not 100.00+  I HOPE THIS ESTABLISHMENT SHUTS DOWN OR LEARNS SOME TECHNIQUE AND HOW TO INFUSE FLAVOUR INTO THEIR FOOD.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",

Very uncommon, but extremely good without it being too intimidating.  Love the decor and the vibe of this place. Very cool without trying so hard to be cool. Its more low key then the other sushi places, relying more on the quality of the food than the party atmosphere. The staff is attentive and always reviews the order with you before they send it in.

Our server was pleasant and, most if all, attentive. The menu has all the standard Sushi selections, plus special rolls and a large variety of cooked dishes, including stir fry items. They also have a full bar. The prices are very fair for the portion size and quality, and were far more reasonable than we expected to see in a large city. We started with the soft shell crab appetizer...excellent! We then had a Volcano and Cherry Blossom Roll, and Salmon Sushi. The salmon was delicious and fresh, the rolls yummy and nicely presented. Nice neighborhood gem in Charlotte. We will definitely revisit on our next trip to town.",

The teriyaki style food is alright.  Also, the last time I ate there, all of the waitresses and hostesses were sitting around on their phones while we waited for service which didn't look good. Definitely recommend Room 112 if you just want sushi",

And I normally don't pay attention to such things.. good thing I did!! Secondly, the ginger dressing was quite odd. Not what Im used to, and very 'mayonaise-y' (creamy).  And while the rolls were quite good, nothing stood out as fantastic about them. The tempura flakes on one of our rolls were definitely stale.  (unless chewy tempura flakes are the new thing...?) next time I'm in the Queen City, I will skip Room 112. Sorry (as for the filthy wine glass, it was replaced even after the wine was poured in... the bottle was replaced as well).",

The gyoza plus the dipping sauce was awesome and the spring roll was tasty as well.  For dinner we had the sesame chicken and tuna and salmon maki rolls.  The rolls are kind of small, so make sure you order enough to fill you up!  The portion size for the sesame chicken was just right for a satisfying dinner.  For all that food, plus beer, our check came to about $45, not including tip.  Check out their webpage for pricing and menus!  Our server was very polite and patient as we tried to figure out what to order.  And to top it off, they have a complimentary valet which relieves you of fighting uptown traffic.  The only negative - no dessert!",

    "text": "We need more places where you can get sushi in uptown like we need more condo projects.  Within the actual uptown area (walking distance from trade & tryon) you can get sushi at almost 10 places.  You can't find a pancake or actual breakfast place in uptown (pancake house isn't walking distance so drop that thought) but any instant craving for a spicy tuna roll can be pacified in mere steps.  As you can gather, I was a little bias when I walked into Room 112.    The inside was smaller with a light fusion feel accompanied by some traditional Asian atmosphere.  We were seated promptly and provided waters (a hydrated table is a happy table).  The server questioned if we had dined there before and overall she was quite pleasant.  We ordered about 10 rolls and the fourth person got an entree.  The sushi was delicious.  The rolls were smaller but came in 8 pieces (most of the rolls) so there were more pieces just of smaller size.  It's nice this way because it limits situations where you have to \"mouth\" a huge piece and have to chew for an hour like it's your job.  The entree (I did not taste) was so so.  I don't think it was as much from a flavor aspect but moreover from a presentation perspective.  Sesame chicken is usually made by cooking the chicken with the sauce (or just combining the two) as opposed to cooking chicken tenders, slicing them- and putting the sauce on the side to dip in.  But hey, I was there for sushi and it was great.    I would go back to Room 112 again for a roll and a Sapporo anytime.  I'm weary of sushi places that force loud music on a busy night to compensate for sloppy bland rolls or sushi places that offer huge all you can eat specials screaming \"we don't move much fish so the freshness should come into question\".  Room 112 is the perfect size to ensure your quality doesn't get negotiated for capacity.  I'm giving Room 112 three stars for now because of the entree and in the end, any team can win on any night; show me consistency and I'll show you four or five stars and my new sushi spot.",

So first off, this place was impossible to find, I should of taken it as a sign to eat else where when I walked past it the first 2 times but I was craving sushi and determined to get my fix.  Once inside the I was shocked how small it was but I didn't mind because I enjoy cozy spaces only it wasn't very much cozy.  There was a larger party of about 8-9 ppl that was just finishing up and one person at the bar. Me and my fiance causally sat our selves as instructed at one of the nearby booths. Immediately my eyes met some sticky spots on the floor and wall.  The tables were clean though and we were quickly asked our drinks.  After ordering drinks I decided on a salmon maki roll (can't remember the name), some pieces of salmon and tuna nigiri, a cup of miso soup, and a spring roll. My fiance ordered Kung PO shrimp and a Stella to drink. My miso soup came out flavorful and spring roll crisp and delicious. My entree' however, could of been better. My maki rolls were blah. I went to reach over for some soy sauce and they both, the regular and low sodium was near empty. I then when and tried my nigiri pieces and they didn't taste as fresh as I expected. I looked over and asked my fiance how his food tasted and he replied it was lacking flavor, and disappointed by the small portion. Let just say we were not impressed.  We were now the only ppl in the store other than the guy at the bar. With that being said it took our waitress a expected to get our checks and payment taken care of. Meanwhile the party's used dishes from earlier still sat on the table.. A good 15 mins had passed since they had left.. Maybe everyone was on break?  Overall not a great dining out experience from the service to the ambiance and food. Maybe they were having an off night or that they are just another overrated uptown restaurant.",

Most recently, on Saturday night for a birthday. The space is pretty small, so it does fill up quite quickly.  Pretty sure I've had almost every roll on the menu. Everything is great. I get something different each time. The ingredients are fresh and delicious. I always get sushi when I come here, but the menu also has noodles, fried rice, wok, hibachi, specialty, etc type dishes.  We go through a lot of hot house saki every trip here. I think the staff gets a big kick out of watching our group.  It can be a little pricey to eat here. My friend and I had drinks (maybe a saki added in there too.. can't remember now), two rolls, few pieces of nigiri, miso soups... with gratuity added it was about $80.  If you work/live/stay uptown, this is a great place to walk to for a sushi fix. Parking may be a little challenging if you have to drive. On the weekends, there is a valet. Week nights... parking on the street (if you can find it) is free after 6pm. A lot of the garages around there though are just $5.",

No customers in restaurant at the time, staff just sitting around, no effort to clean establishment. The sushi was excellent. The manager and owner should learn how to attain restaurant standards. SLOBS! Staff need training from management. Eat at your own risk!",

That's just a personal preference and probably should have just had sashimi.

I asked them to cook the broccoli tender and they did it perfectly. It was not as greasy as a regular Chinese food place would be which is a plus (I know its an Asian place, ijs lol).   The only thing i didn't care for was the plates. They use very pretty long rectangular plates and your food always falls off the sides. Other than that I highly recommend this place, if you're having a taste for some good Chinese food................opt for Asian ;-)",

I've been to many of these types of restaurants that have resorted to low quality sushi. This place was surprisingly not like the rest!  Fantastic service. Other than a couple order mistakes, our server was warm, incredibly polite, patient, attentive, generous... She actually provided the best service I have experienced in Charlotte yet! Should've gotten her name.   We ordered a plethora of sushi, and judging by the cleanliness of the place, felt the urge to have some Chinese as well. We ordered the battered shrimp with coconut sauce and the salt and pepper shrimp. Both were amazing and served with perfectly cooked Jasmine rice. (It actually felt like some sort of rice that fell between jasmine and basmati).  I'm a rice fiend, so, this certainly stood out to me. (Don't worry, the sushi was True to its beautiful sushi rice)  The shrimp was nicely battered. The batter was thick, but not overly oily/greasy. Tasty without feeling like it was soaked in MSG.   I found the coconut sauce to be just perfectly sweet. Not too much and not fatty like other mayo based dressings you find at most Chinese restaurants.   All in all. I was thrilled. (Btw, I'm Asian. So... I feel I'm a worthy critic) haha.   Can't wait to come back here again!",

I wanted some greasy food but i wanted something light.  I read some reviews and ended up at this place. - Room 112 (after all, that is where the playa's dwell. @ least thats what Biggie Small said) After using my GPS (Thanks protestors for making me walk around uptown to avoid you)  Anyway, i read a review from Demetria M. saying sushi COMBO. So i walked in asking, \"Do you have any specials, or lunch special/combo's?\".  Answer - NO, our prices are \"special friendly\"  WHAT DA WHAT??? I don't even know what that mean but.... OK. (even though I know their is one) I was told to sit at the other bar for Dine Out. (a whole 2 bar stools over). I placed my order (Spicey Crab Roll & Rainbow Chicken... see photo).  After about 2 mins. I get a tap on the shoulder. Can you move BACK over there to the other bar (a whooping 4 feet over). @ this point I'm looking around for Aston Kutcher. Are you serious wth, \"Yeah, I know, I thought you were dining in\" WHAT?? HUH?? How did you gather that? Was it the fact that when I came in i said it was TAKE OUT?  anyway... After walking 4 or 5 blocks back to the gig, I was very pleased w/ what they packed in the bag. A WHOLE LOTTA FOOD!!... and still STEAMING HOT!  ** When I was signing my tab, the SAMEEEE GAL came talking about some, \"Ya know we have pretty good special! OPENS another MENU & points out the combo Demetria spoke about.   MANNNN LET ME OUTTA HERE, I DON'T WANNA BE ON THIS SHOW ANYMORE. YOU ALL ARE PLAYIN W/ MY MIND AND HUNGRY STOMACH. and my stomach is NOT to be played with. lol..LOL..LOL  I'LL RETURN... but i DON'T want to play mary-go-round or hide and seek the lunch special/combo.",

Following, we ate 12 (yes 12) rolls because there were so many choices! We got two of each of the staples...Cali roll and Spicy tuna roll. The California roll was good and the spicy tuna roll was okay. Following 8: (2) Cherry Blossoms...AMAZING so good. The Spider Roll is typically my fave and it was soooo good. The Pink Floyd and Salmon Dream were also really great and total hits. I can't remember which other three rolls we got (sorry) but those were also great. One of us got a ginger salad and a couple of cokes brought us in at $140 plus tip... not bad. Its worth the price because the cheaper stuff at KO down the road is terrible. I will be back!

I've dined in and ordered take out and the quality of food remains the same. They have a great lunch menu as well, including sushi combos.   I typically get sashimi, a roll or two, and miso soup. While it's a simple order, they get it just right and it always tastes fresh and delicious. However, they also have other stir-fry, noodles, and rice based dishes on the menu - there's something for everyone.   Room 112 is tucked away, but that doesn't mean it's a secret. While it's a small restaurant, it can fill up quickly, especially during lunch! They're also open late, which is convenient when I've been delayed and get in late or am looking for a late night snack.",

Sometimes we'll grab a Volcano Roll but substitute the California beneath it with something different, most often a Crunchy California.  We try to ask for Brandon each time... takes excellent care of us!  I've been wanting to try other dishes but it's hard to stray from such a great trend we've started.  Room 112 has quickly become the clear Sushi favorite for us in Charlotte and even when we sample some national favorites like Oishii in Boston, we find ourselves still preferring the sushi at 112.  Update:   We now order the K5 (named after my wife and I).  I think if you guys start ordering they'll have to add it to the menu.  Brandon will know what you are talking about!  (has Tempura Shrimp, Avacado, Jalapeno Slice, and more... You'll Love.)",

However, I did waste a little time trying to find the place. I was aware of the side door located on Trade Street by the Polk Park waterfall, but apparently that is not an entrance. Avoid looking like a moron like me and instead enter through 112 Tryon Place.   I ordered the Super Crunchy roll (crab, shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese, masago, unagi sauce). It was pretty good but there was nothing to really distinguish it from the countless other sushi places uptown. There could have been more masago, if not only for presentation. On top of that, it was a little pricier than I would've liked. I expected 10 or 12 pieces for $9 but the 8 pieces left me a little hungry.",

Our dinner was very enjoyable, food was delicious and ambiance perfect! Also to the couple sitting by the window who paid for our dinner without us knowing...THANK YOU!

Go early or be prepared to wait in the adjoining lobby.  The sushi combo lunch can't be beat: two maki rolls and a side salad for $9. I can't speak to the rest of the menu as I'm always in the sushi mindset when I visit, but everything that comes out of the kitchen looks wonderful.   For my fellow gluten free diners, they carry GF soy sauce and aren't stingy at all with serving it.   I've been fortunate to have consistently great service at Room 112. I've gone for rushed lunches and leisurely dinners in parties of two to six and have found that my servers have been in tune with our pace each time.   AND you get a delightful Andes mint with your check, which -- while seemingly in contrast with the Asian fusion menu -- is a real treat.",

Was not quite in the mood for sushi and just couldn't decide on anything; asked our waiter for his recommendation and he gave Pankio Chicken so we both ordered with fried rice instead of white. First ones of the night to order, 30 mins later food was coming. Chicken was to the extreme Pankio and seemed to be processed not fresh, broccoli was cold but good, fried rice was 5 mins later and over cooked! I also hate when in the middle of a meal and they ask me if I want a refill to my half empty glass..special Japanese sauce seemed to taste like McDonald's BBQ to us.

Lunch time this place is CROWDED. Good food every time we've gone, but at times (during lunch) service can be slow. I'll chalk that up to the busy lunch time period.   Overall, great place, could be a 5-star rating for me if they upped the service a bit.",

This is my go to spot for Chinese food now and you cannot go wrong with their Broccoli and chicken/tofu which is what I get at least once a week.

It's tucked behind the fountain in the corner. Staff were very friendly, decor was nice. On a Friday night around 915 ish the last of the big crowd were finishing up and we were able to get a table with no wait. My friend and I split 3 rolls (sexy salmon, catepillar, and another that I already forgot). They were all excellent!  Location was convenient because from where we parked we were able to walk to the Uptown bars. Will definitely return!",

No one was taking care to re fill the glasses or soft drinks. I didn't want to give a single penny for tip but they added gratuity from their side.  Very Very poor service.

    "text": "Room 112 would be pretty perfect if your $25 got you a little further than it does. I find that even when you splurge on the food here, you're only getting a small portion. I suppose it's a good change from the wastage and mass-production of Lean Cuisine in this country, but an extra slice of fish didn't kill anyone did it?  Everything about this place is \"clean\" from the the Asian decor, to the sharp black dress of the waiting staff and not to-mention the quality of ingredients. Sushi needs to be crisp on the palate, not overpowered by the rice, wasabi, or soy and this is definitely the case at Room 112. Delicious sushi dishes with vibrant presentation. You'll spend a lot of time on the menu since the difference between one roll to the next is literally one ingredient. You could probably order any sushi roll and be satisfied (nigiri or maki). I tend to stay away from the cream cheese as that's just an insult to fresh fish.   There's an enticing \"Rouge\" hue to this place that makes your eating experience all the better. I would recommend you accompany every meal with a bottle of sake (warm or cold). My favorite is the Ozeki Nigori sake, as it's very very reasonably priced, flavorsome and light.   As for the other dishes on the menu, the most appetizing dishes are the \"Specialties,\" which push me away just because of the price tag even though they're scrumptious. This kind of restaurant can't justify a $20 duck dish. Just look at the people around you. I'm walking in with a t-shirt and jeans for a light dinner. I didn't realize it was gonna burn a hole in my pocket. To be quite frank, you'll have to drop $30 here to sample the best of the best. After all, why wouldn't you want the best they have to offer? So be prepared!  Go for the Passion and Cherry Blossom as rolls Singapore Rice Noodles Any of the Teriyaki Grill items Kalbi or Miso Sea Bass  Enjoy!  4/5",

The chicken was seasoned just right, and the sauce was amazing! I love it!! I didn't have room for dessert, but the entree was good enough for me!  Our waiter was extremely nice and the service was great! The place is not the biggest, but the atmosphere and ambiance that you get is so relaxing. It's not loud, messy or crowded, and that I loved.

They have a ginormous menu and reasonable prices and for that alone it's a good place to feed your inner sushi monster (we all have one...)   The decor is very cozy and comfortable. It's a small venue but it was really great for an intimate group dinner.   We had a group of 9 and all ordered various drinks. In the beginning our server was on the ball and even let me sample their plum wine before committing (some are too sweet for my liking). After our order was placed he seemed distant and overwhelmed. He never asked us if we wanted dessert (which two of us did) he just brought the bill and completely botched everyone's check charging people for dishes they didn't order...including my poor friends who left early and ended up getting charged for my boyfriends meal. Our server was very quiet and overall just not present at all....perhaps his 20% gratuity charge was reason for his lack of service ?   The food was delicious. I had bites of pho, several rolls ( get the cherry blossom) and the sesame chicken. Though the pho wasn't my cup of tea, the rest were delicious. They even managed to turn a couple sushi-phobes into full fledged fans.   I'll return and hope that the poor service was just a fluke!",

The ambiance/interior design is kind of dated and it's a little weird to have a spot in a bank, but we liked the food (lunch) a lot. The only sort of unpleasant thing was that one of the staff (bartender?) was hanging around before her shift (I'm guessing) and was very unprofessionally spreading her crap out on the bar as she ate her meal, and then was going back and forth behind the counter, while she complained loudly about something personal. It was intrusive. I worked in restaurants throughout my 20s, so I'm not being prissy about this. It's just bad form. Other than that, it was a pretty good experience and I would eat here again.",

The service was pretty bad, when the sexy salmon came out the waiter torched it on top without warning me at all and I almost had a heart attack. After half of is waiting over an hour for sushi then the waiter disappeared and we had to wait about 15 minutes more for the check. None of our food was discounted so I paid $25 for a meal I only ate half of because I filled up on rice and miso soup. I would recommend it for taste but be prepared to wait!",

The only draw backs are the street parking and every time I've been here the service has been a little slow. I recommend the cherry blossom roll, it comes in the shape of a flower and its wrapped with pink seaweed!",

The atmosphere here was really neat, with music at the right volume, great lighting, and comfortable leather seating.   We are both big fans of sushi and this is one of her favorite spots in the city so I elected to oblige her request to join her here. The restaurant is not very large, but the space is utilized quite well.   Our waiter was terrific! We struggled to decide on our entree for a bit and he was incredibly patient. We both enjoyed a glass of cabernet as we decided and conversed about sushi. The pricing was competitive for the quality of sushi we selected. We did not have to wait to be seated and yet it was still busy for a week night.   Excellent restaurant. Excellent sushi. Great experience!",

For starters the service just wasn't on par with what I expect when dining out. I may be being petty, but I ordered a cocktail and it was served in a soda glass. Not sure why that bothered me so much, but it did. I expected more choices of sushi than what they offered. Both my fiance and I were very disappointed in the choices we had. For the sushi we did order it didn't taste that bad. If you have a Groupon, I'd say maybe eat here, but other than that I'd stay away. Rest assured I will not be going back. There is way better sushi in other restaurants.",

I can't remember the details of that experience but I remember not hating it, so when I was craving sushi recently and in the area, I got lunch from here to go. I ordered a veggie spring roll and a crunchy roll without cream cheese. The price was decent and the wait wasn't terrible.   I walked across the street to the coffee shop where we were doing some work and then ate my takeout. I say that to say, there wasn't a large gap of time between when I got my food and when I ate it so I feel like I got a good representation of what their food tastes like.   The spring roll was okay - decent size and crispy on the outside. What I didn't love is that the veggies inside were kind of mushy.   The crunch roll was pretty good. I wish the shrimp tempura were more fresh, but it was still good.   Overall, I won't rush back to this place but I wouldn't be opposed to having it again. I think the three and a half star average review is spot on.",

The time it took from ordering and receiving the food didn't take that long for a medium size group like ours. Both of my rolls and sashimi were pretty fresh, which is a MUST for any sushi restaurants. The atmosphere here was pretty trendy and casual.   The bad: for some reason the seaweed in my sushi roll was a bit hard chew, which was something I never noticed before in any sushi rolls I had, and I am an avid sushi lover.

It's also a real nice thing if you have decent weather and can meet your wife for lunch in uptown. By the time I took the trek, we ended up settling on Room 112 as they have a decent sushi lunch special that we figured wouldn't take too long. After a long morning of waiting, I wanted something to snack on quickly so I ended up ordering some edamame in addition to my sushi lunch combo. Both the spicy tuna and crunchy rolls I ordered were good.   If you stop in for lunch like I did, be prepared for a crowd. The place isn't large and they get pretty busy. We ended up sitting at the bar which was a blessing in disguise. The wait staff behind the bar were super attentive and I feel like we got our rolls faster than we would have at a table. Also if you are in a rush, order ahead. There must have been at least 10 to-go bags on the counter so they can turn those orders quickly.   All in all, it was one of the better lunch sushi experiences I have had and would consider it again!",

    "text": "So had just wrapped up a gig in Charlotte and as part of my year tenure in Charlotte, I had tried many places for food including Room 112. It was conveniently located next to the office building I had to work out of and it was a place where I knew I could grab food quickly as the service is quick. On top of this, it is probably one of the very few sushi joints in the uptown area so it adds a check mark for convenience. The joint itself is fairly small with only a small sushi bar spot with 5 stools and then tables to serve around 30ish people total within the restaurant itself.  The servers here are all nice and I am grateful that they would always remember my drink order. I would always get the tuna tartare with avocado and then an eclectic mix of sashimi. During my many times here, I have had the tuna, salmon, mackerel, uni (when available), and the list goes on. The appetizer is simple and comes drizzled with a tasty sauce. It is standard fare and a nice starting dish. For all the sashimi, I think the quality is OK. Some days it is better and other days it does taste a \"bit fishy\" with that after frozen feel to it. The ratio of fish to rice is solid which is appreciated but I think the biggest hurdle is that their inventory of sashimi is hit or miss depending on the week you go. There have been many times where they have not had a few of the cuts of fish that I wanted which  I understand as I am sure sashimi is not a \"big thing\" in Charlotte given  the demographics. The rolls (although I have not had any) look good and lots of people seem to order that vs what I was ordering.  All in all, Room 112 was an OK spot that is certainly convenient. Definitely worth checking  out for the lunch time as there seem to be many specials making it a good deal for professionals.",

    "text": "Room 112 is one of very, very few places that serve sushi in the Uptown area (other than Fujo and KO Sushi).  During lunch, it can get super crowded and even if you're taking your food out, you will likely still have to wait a good 10-20 minutes to get your order.  I would recommend calling ahead during lunch.  I've been here for both lunch and dinner and prefer this place to be a quick lunch pick up spot.  They have lunch specials which consist of 2 rolls and a salad for around $9.  The rolls are consistently decent and I always order the spicy rolls which unfortunately come with that \"crunch\", which is more like fried tempura (and extra fatness), acting as a filler for more fish.  I'm really not a fan of the crunch rolls at all, but it's decent.  The salad here is very mediocre at best - a bunch of iceberg lettuce (which has like zero nutritional value) and what tastes like thousand island dressing - yikes.  I normally skip the salad part and head straight for the goods.  For dinner, I'd rather go to O-Ku.  In all fairness, Room 112 isn't a bad spot for a quick bite and definitely a decent option lunch, but given the wait, quality, and value, I prefer KO sushi a little more for lunch - that's if we're doing a comparison of all the sushi places in Uptown.  Rolls are decent, but nothing to call home about.",

The environs are dark, modern, and comfortable, the staff friendly, and the menu tantalizing with enough variety to suit many palates. My companion and I opted for gyoza, a Just Pete sushi roll (fried smoked salmon, crab, avocado, and cream cheese), a beef and vegetable stir fry, and Singapore rice noodles with chicken and shrimp. The flavors were well-balanced, the meat was tender, and everything was fresh and fragrant. This might be the best-smelling restaurant I've ever had occasion to frequent. Prices were moderate, with good-sized portions for the money: We paid $6 for the app, $10 for the sushi, and $11-$12 each for the entrees. Ultimately, one who has enjoyed a lot of Asian cuisine won't be breaking any new ground here, but what familiar favorites Room 112 offers, it does damn well.",

I chose 112 over Fujo and Enso based on Yelp, and I'm glad that I did.  I came around 8PM on a Tuesday night, and while all of the seats at the sushi bar were occupied (all 6 of them...), there were only 2 other parties seated at tables. In my opinion, and having been to some small sushi bars, this place is just the right size. About 15 tables, mostly 4-tops, which means that the chefs can handle their guests and you can still feel like you're not just dining at home.  The maki rolls I ordered were good (nothing incredible, but the fish was fresh) and the service was excellent. Prices were respectable as well (keeping in mind that I'm used to prices in the DC market...).  Would absolutely recommend, and will return to again.",

It can be a little hard to find, hidden behind on the fountain on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FE.Trade&s=ca034e68c1e6b7ccd71b298ee1c3fbaac31db49270b6573eb374ef00a524c36e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">E.Trade</a> and Tryon. The restaurant is relatively small but I love the modern Asian chic bar/club feel and decor.   The first item I had was a \"Cherry Blossom\" roll as recommended by the waiters. The rice and ingredients were wrapped in a thin pink layer (could be seaweed but I am not sure). It has tempura shrimp, tuna, and cucumber. Everything combined well in the mouth. The rolls were in the shape of a flower too!   The second time I had a tuna roll. It's got white tuna on the outside and red tuna and other veggies in the inside and a hint of semi-spicy sauce on top. I loved it. My girlfriend ordered a veggie stir-fry, and it was actually pretty good too!   In the end, I still was not satisfied with my sushi crave so I ordered a tuna nigiri , which comes on rice, except that I said tuna sashimi (no rice)...guess I have been out of Japan for too long...however, it was actually a blessing in disguise!! The tuna was very  fresh, and the display looked as if I was in Japan! Good job Charlotte!",

Their spring rolls are awesome too so I always have one of those. I'm getting hungry as I write this.. Need. Sushi. Now. Please.  It's a low key spot. It's not fancy, nor does it try to be. It also doesn't play loud, obnoxious music (thanks Enso). It's simple and authentic, but delicious!

    "text": "Disappointing on several accounts. We had a $25 Groupon that was supposed to get us $50.00 of food. There was NO WAY that could happen as it was limited to 3 rolls and 1 appetizer.   At average price of $9.00 - $10 a roll (for the more expensive ones) and $8 for appetizer. There was NO WAY you could combing 4 items to come anywhere close to $50 let alone barely matching $25 we paid for.   Then we had to pay for drinks ($2.00 for a green tea leaf bag). Total was $29.00 for about $35.00 of food.   My complaint thus far of course, is mainly with the lack of value of the Groupon.   The rolls themselves were fine and presented nicely and visually appealing.   Would have been better to skip Groupon and have more options. However we did learn of a new place we may go back to.   Other negative is its very small. I could barely fit into the first couples table they seated us in (no, I'm not fat either!). We had to ask for a more spacious table just to have some elbow room. They can seat 42 people at their tables but they're packed so tightly we could barely walk out without having to inconvenience others to scoot in.   It's okay, the smallness of it, so-so service, and average food was not quite worth while and perhaps if they focused on service they would not need Groupon to advertise for them.",

But everything else made up for the eel. I absolutely despise going uptown but if I ever am, I'll be coming here.",

Most of there business seems to be to go and they push out a lot of sushi that way!   Onto the food though! The sushi was excellently prepared and in a pretty quick time too. They were seemingly busy pushing orders out but still took time to make each order perfectly.   All ingredients were fresh and looked great. Definitely would come back here again or order to go to get my sushi fix.",

My gf ordered a Sweet Potato Roll, Avocado Roll, and Crispy Tofu.   The crispy tofu is literally bland tofu fried. We attempted to make the tofu tasty by dipping it into multiple sauces but nothing worked. As you can imagine, we definitely did not finish it nor did we pack the rest for home. The sushi itself was okay. Some rolls were tasty but the others were not. The service was quick luckily since there were only 1 or 2 diners other that ourselves.   I don't recommend.",

I am thankful they were open on a holiday, but very disappointed in my food. I ordered a Sweet Potato Roll, Avocado Roll, and Crispy Tofu. The crispy tofu is literally bland tofu fried - literally no seasoning whatsoever. We attempted to make the tofu tasty by dipping it into multiple sauces (soy sauce, sweet sauce, peanut sauce, etc) but nothing worked. The sweet potato roll was just cut sweet potato rolled into a sushi. The sweet potato is supposed to be seasoned and fried as it is at every other sushi spot that I have been to. Nothing to complain with my avocado roll, that would be really crazy if they messed that up. The service was quick luckily since there were only 1 or 2 diners other that ourselves.   Anyways, 100% will not be back not even for drinks.",

I went for lunch and walked in to see several tables dirty. We waited for someone to wipe off a table so we could be seated. I was a little shocked to see so many dirty tables being that the restaurant was not full and they had a good amount of waitstaff. Nevertheless the food is relatively good and quick to arrive. I ordered the chicken katsu which is crispy and with fried rice that came with a delicious dipping sauce. The food was just good nothing really really stood out about the entrees.",

The service was good and attentive. They were able to accommodate something extra in our meal that was removed from the menu at the restaurants. Thank you for the great service. I didn't give 5 stars because the noodles were uncooked. When They mentioned fried noodle, I thought it was cooked noodles that was fried hard after but it taste like Roman noodle that wasn't boiled at all and toast in oil. This wasn't my favorite but the seafood and veggies was great.",

We were greeted when we walked in but I did wish there was a little more energy from employees. The firecracker sushi was really good and I thought the beer prices were really good for an uptown location ($3-$4 a bottle). Our waitress Leanne (sp) was nice but definitely not energetic, very impersonal in a way. We received our drinks , food, water etc so not much to complain about. The food was ok but not great. I would come again for sushi and that's all. We had the sea bass and shrimp hibachi. Overall all I enjoyed my time here. It was a good spot that we found via Groupon .",

This particular day I felt the waitress wasn't as upbeat.. & as I placed my order I noticed a eye roll when I went to make a modification to the order..

It was definitely heavy on the noodles.  Noodles. Noodles. Noodles. I didn't think the presentation was all that appealing.   The dish itself was way too salty.  There was soy sauce on the table, so patrons had a good way to add salt to taste.  So, with this said, I probably would not return.  I DID like the space and the service was fine.   I am a stickler for having sweet and low for my iced tea.  They made me use Splenda, because they were too tight to offer the PINK and the GREEN and the BLUE options.  It's always the details that get in the way, huh?  The small details.   They could do better.  Apparently it is a popular spot, because it was crowded.",

Any other time if a rating was below a 95, I find the door.   Ordered the seaweed salad.   Had mostly large pieces of cucumber at the bottom.  Not much salad on top.  It tasted ok.  Had sushi but can not remember the name.  It was ok.    While eating, my companion noticed that a different (not the sleeping one)employee was behind the bar.  The employee spit into the trash can and proceeded to blow his nose.  Never seen him wash his hands.  Not a sight you want to see while you are eating.   Overall: If the sanitation rating was higher, I would have enjoyed it.   The place is dirty.  Employees on their phone.   People sleeping.  Food on the floor.

    "text": "Ooooookkkkkkk sooo where to start... Let me first say that my coworkers and I have eaten at this restaurant multiple times in the past with no issues. It's a busy place during lunch rush, but even then it's always delivered good food and we've enjoyed our times there. Today for some reason was totally different. Four of us went for lunch a little after 1pm so the restaurant was not as packed as it normally would be. I approached the counter and asked for a table for four. I was told a brief two minute wait which was more than fine of course.   After we got seated is when all of the issues started... We sat for a few minutes waiting on someone to come get our drink order, but when the person came he (receipt said his name is Brandon) had a horrible attitude. It was as if he did not want to be there. He seemed to kinda slam the glasses on the table as well as the menus. One of my coworkers, being the kind hearted soul he is, attempted to kill the server with kindness in the hopes of changing his attitude, but that had absolutely no effect at that point. We went ahead and placed our order with the assumption that maybe he was just having a bad day.   When our food came, it too came with an attitude and we noticed this same server deliver the same attitude to a nearby table. The final straw was when I asked for a sauce, that I made sure to ask for when I initially ordered, to be brought to the table because it did not come out with my meal. I was waiting on it so that I could start eating. We watched the server walk past our table twice after being asked and he never went into the kitchen or attempted to get it. My coworker finally got up went to the counter and threatened to walk out. The server then begins to go back and forth with my coworker about how he is doing something else... all while my lunch gets colder by the second. Finally another worker at the counter goes into the kitchen to do what took all of 10 seconds.   Needless to say, none of us truly enjoyed our lunch as we had planned. We paid and left. There was no discussion about it, no apology, nothing. This was one of our favorite places to eat because we could walk there from work with no problem. I don't know what happened today or why the service was what it was, but that is not what we had come to know from this business. We usually go in large groups for good food and laughter, but after today...  Oh and the 2 stars is only for that employee who took the initiative to offer some customer service.",

It was nice and refreshing. The crab part had a kick to it that I wasn't prepared for but it was still good. The cucumbers still had a nice crunch to it. I had the spider roll which I thought would be as good as the firecracker roll but it wasn't. I think what got me was the lettuce on it. The service this time was much better than our last visit. We were greeted right away. Hostess brought us menus right as we sat down at the bar. Got our food right away and still had about 15 minutes left on our lunch break to relax after we ate. That's definitely how it should be. Thanks for a much better service! 6/6/18",

    "text": "For as amazing as the food was on my takeout order of Shrimp and broccoli, the attitude of the cashier/hostess definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.  I work uptown and looked online at the menu to see what I wanted to order and called it in. Once I arrive the total was completely different. Once I asked the young lady why there was a difference, I was told it was because I had shrimp. I simply and politely stated that online it said that shrimp and Broccoli is $7.50 for the lunch special. Her disdain for my questioning was apparent and she stated \"oh well that's online\". Full confusion is my stance at this point. I asked what does that mean. At this point another young lady stepped in and simply stated online hasn't been updated and handed me the menu. The price difference isn't the issue. If I am spending my money and there's a difference, a simple explanation is warranted without the attitude. There's too many places Uptown to eat to deal with nonsense.",

The place was busier when we left but for a Saturday it was quiet. Maybe because there were all kinds of things going on at the Stadiums that day and it was early. The food was really really good.... We got several rolls but our favorites were the Pink Floyd and the 112.... We each had a glass of wine too. The servers were very nice and our food was well presented.  I'm not sure how long this place has been in Charlotte but I will be there again. It is a little hidden so if you're just driving by Tryon you won't see it.",

It's a little difficult to find, but to the person who said it was behind the waterfall, great job because that is about how you would describe it.   I made reservations because they request that you do for a party of 5 or more. They were very accommodating even tho I had to push back the reservations about an hour before our scheduled time.   When we got there I ordered a vodka, Sprite with house vodka (later on found out that is Aristocrat :P), it was ok. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, because at Viet Thai Noodle House this dish is amazing, but I had never had it elsewhere. Other people at the table ordered wine, and sushi rolls.   When the Pad Thai came out I just did not like it at all. It tasted like the sauce was sweet and sour sauce, which was confusing.   Everyone seemed to enjoy their sushi rolls, but when you're ordering just watch what it's rolled in because someone that was expecting the standard rice and seaweed, got cucumber.   Overall, I thought the service was pretty good, the prices were good for uptown, but the food was just not there.",

It's a difficult place to find when you enter the building but easier to spot from the street.    Could be a solid 4 stars if the service staff knew their drinks. That is, one friend ordered a martini, she didn't want it dirty. They gave it to her dirty.  Later, another friend showed up asking for martini neat - and again, splashed with olive juice.  They gotta learn their mixology.  Overall, solid place to have a bday - for whatever reason they weren't too crazy busy so my group and I got rowdy and had a good time.  dmo out",

I forgot her name but she a cute Asian girl server.  The food was really good and we were pleased.   We decided to come again cauze our first visit was great. This time around was a complete 360. Bad service, less calamari then last time in our appetizer and the sauce on the sushi was very little.  We were very disappointed with the service the most. Server was this tall Caucasian male wirh gauges in his ears. We rarely checked on us and we constantly waived the manager down to get us something.  We knew the server want busy become he was right in front of us but behind the sushi bar.  Two other things that was disturbing was that another girl server was playing and braiding her hair where all the sushi was being made...  Restaurant cleanliness was not there today.  She playing with her hair made me conclude that management is not strict with their hygiene policy and managers or owners are just too easy going...  Horrible.   Lastly the ambience was not there.  I literally felt like I was in a clothing store like pacsun or American Eagle cause the rock music they were playing was not right for sushi dinner ambience..",

The sushi was really good but my sea bass entree left me wanting more unfortunately.  I mean it was fine, but just fine.  The service was fantastic and our waitress kept up with our large group table perfectly.  If I were to go back I would just stick to the sushi side of the menu probably.  Parking is tough here.

Whiich was then  completely wrong when we did finally get it, and that was after we waited 25 minutes just to be seated at a table. Meanwhile groups of 2 and single people were taken in front of us and seated. The waitress never check back on our table after she brought the food, she never refilled a drink. We had to go to the counter to get our bill.  It was as if we were a plague and she was trying to avoid us at all cost. She never asked how our food was or if we need to go boxes nothing! Once I looked at our check I then noticed she automatically apply a 20% tip for herself! Knowing she completely ignored not only our table but forgot half of our order as well. FYI** If you have a party of 6 or more they charge gratuity. We were not told this when we were seated, even if you have children under the age of 6.  3 out of the 7 of us were kids, 1 an infant, who did not eat. The other 2 children shared a bowl of rice. I was shocked that someone would allow their employees to treat customers this way. Go there if you want but please be aware of the way they operate. There's a lot of other hibachi restaurants that value customers and want to give you a good experience.",

The young girl working the register for take out was really helpful and nice.  I explained it was my first time, and that I'm pregnant, so there are things I want to modify and she was great.  The 'chefs' didn't speak, like I'm used to in LA, most sushi bars/restaurants when you walk in, the whole staff yells something in japanese, saying 'hello!\" or 'welcome.\" maybe it's a west coast thing.  But I thanked them on my way out and they were nice and smiled.  My second time back, I think they recognized me from the first time, and were much more friendly. :) Said 'hello' and 'goodbye' on my way in and out.   Now onto the food: I ordered the crunchy shrimp tempura roll- it had avocado and crab in it.  Was really good.  But I give it 1 STAR.  WHY??? B/c and maybe it's just me but...  THEY DO NOT TAKE THE VEIN/POOP LINE out of their shrimp.  I even went back the next day and ordered it again, thinking it was a fluke and nope.  That long string of black tar was hanging out of each of my rolls.  Sorry.  But de-vein the shrimp folks!! Please.  Not doing so ruins the meal, at least for True sushi/roll fanatics.    Miso soup- was tasty.  hard to mess that up.   The best thing I had was the Chicken lettuce wraps.  DELICIOUS.   I'm sure the lettuce isn't organic, so it's probably sprayed with mad GMO's that would make me faint if I knew the truth...but I just pretended that it was from Whole Foods or Farmer's market and scarfed them down.    Not sure how the sushi is, b/c I'm pregnant and didn't bother.  But if you get shrimp.  Watch out for the POOP line lol",

The sushi was fresh, and flavorful, especially at their price point, which I appreciated. Another time we went, my soon to be husband planned a double date and proposed after dinner. The dinner that night was better than my first visit, not just the experience, but the food itself lol. So aside from the delicious sushi, this place will always be special for us.",

Smallish space, but the food is Amazing! Did you notice the capital A? Just checking. Portion sizes are perfect for my friend and I to share. We had 2 apps and two rolls... the cherry blossom and.... something else delicious. But the fried tofu was the smash hit of the evening. If we ever figure out how to do that at home, we're using it to take over the world.",

    "text": "If you want to eat here for weekday lunch, get here early. This tiny restaurant fills up quickly, so by 11:45AM there was already a wait list on my last visit.  This restaurant is tucked behind a fountain in a corporate building and I never would have found it if a friend hasn't taken me there on my first visit.  The menu is filled with delicious sushi items and combos. The only problem with that is I don't like sushi. (I've tried, I really have! I've never felt such peer pressure to like a type of food.) Fortunately, they have some non-sushi alternatives on the menu, but not very many.  My usual dish is the Sesame Chicken, and it's good, but not great. The sauce tastes like it's artificially thickened pretty heavily (more than a little cornstarch in it, I think) and it's spooned over the chicken, rather than the chicken being tossed in it. I tried ordering the shrimp version of the dish once, and it was a mess. The coating was falling off the shrimp and it was more trouble to eat than it was worth.  Service is solid, if unremarkable (that's a good thing, in my book) and the price is reasonable. My friends love it so I keep visiting, but I probably wouldn't go if it wasn't someone else's idea.",

The only thing that I dislike is the reservation policy. I have waited an hour for a table in a restaurant that was mostly empty because someone had made a reservations and not showed for them.

I sat at the bar and perused the menu a little. The hostess took my order and was nice and gave me some great suggestions. However, I didn't take her up on any of her suggested menu items. I'm pretty satisfied with what I ordered. I decided to order the volcano salad, a spicy scallop and the leap roll.   I really loved the volcano salad. It had a mixture of seaweed salad, crabmeat and cucumbers and masago. Uber good! Not too much mayo and was light and had a crunch to it with some small pieces of what seemed like fried tempura batter. The spicy scallop handroll was fresh and loved how you get scallop in every bite. It wasn't spicy and I would have preferred some heat since they called it a spicy. I devoured the leap roll because it had all of my favorite fish. It had spicy salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, avocado, crunch, red tobiko, masago, and a spicy aioli. Although, again, the aioli was not spicy as indicated. However, I am not complaining because the roll was still very good and fresh.  The rolls are sliced smaller than what I'm used to but they are perfect for me. In Texas, everything is bigger and that even goes for the sushi slices. I got full off of the leap roll but forced myself to try the spicy scallop and snacked on the salad throughout the night.",

Although the food is wonderful, the service is largely inconsistent. I ordered two sushi rolls (same kind) and they were stuffed into one tray when I made my order to go. The presentation was terrible and it lacked wasabi and ginger, I assume because the to go order was so tightly packed. It may very well be that they just forgot to include it. If ordering to go, perhaps ask if they could pack all rolls separately. I give four stars for the great food, with the missing star being attributed to my to go order being disappointing. I would completely recommend this restaurant 100% dine in.",

The tables that were not full were not bussed and dirty dishes stayed there the entire time I was there.   Most notably, I sat at the small bar which seats about 7. I sat on the end and the 6 seats to my right were a disaster. Every seat had someone sitting at it at one point and the dirty dishes stayed there for the entire 35 or so minutes I was there. This is unacceptable.  It was not nearly busy enough where they couldn't keep up and even if it were, there is still no excuse.   The hours say they are open till 10. As I was leaving around 9:45 a couple walked in and were told the kitchen was closed. If your open till 10, you should serve till 10. But then again, even if they wanted to seat them any open tables were filled with dirty dishes.   The food could be great but a bad aura with a lazy staff not clearing tables and bar spots makes for a bad place.",

I tried something new to me and liked it. I can't remember what it is call but it had steak on top. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi. It's in the hotel secluded from passerby.",

The quality of food from their \"From the Wok\" menu completely blows away any Chinese takeout you'll find around here for roughly the same amount of money. I'd recommend this establishment to anyone looking for great experience in both quality and service.",

Overall location is great and sushi is as well.",

    "text": "I've been all around the Uptown sushi bars during lunch when I'm at the office, but after spending my days there, I rarely venture there at night.  For lunch sushi, Room 112 is my favorite, but I thought to give it a fair review, I needed to go for dinner.    One night I walked over after work to do just that.    Rather than getting the lunch combo, like I ordinarily do, I was able to sample 2 special rolls off the dinner menu.  As usual, Room 112 sent out some good sushi in a small, intimate space.  I was happy to find out that they don't cut back on quality on lunch as the dinner sushi was just as good as what I get during the day.    Room 112 will remain my favorite Uptown sushi spot until something comes along that really blows my socks off.  That has not yet occurred.",

The place could be burning down around them & they wouldn't notice. I served for a decade and even I could see (from my situational awareness) that tables needed pre-bussing, drinks needed refills, patrons needed checks, or simply to see their server once in a blue moon. I've been dragged here multiple times and every time I think why do I or others even come here? The sad truth is because its close by, location location location. But if you choose to dine at Room 112 bring your patience pants, those little stank faced employees will grind your gears. Love to see where they end up, lord knows real life will swallow them alive.",

After an awkward moment, the staff realized we were customers and the hostess got up from her perch to sit us at the bar.   Upon glancing the menu I understood the restaurant was a Pan Asian Fusion/Sushi bar. I ordered the Pad Thai and the waiter asked me, \"have you had Pad Thai before?\" I said, \"yes.\" He replied, \"then you don't want to have ours, you won't like it.\"   Befuddled, I ordered the same dish as my colleague, the teriyaki chicken. I ate the entire thing only because I was very hungry, having skipped breakfast and lunch that day. Despite this, I didn't particularly enjoy it. The flavor was bland. If I had to do it all over again, I would've ordered sushi as it seems to be their specialty.",
