The tables were a bit close for comfort. I now know what a stranger wants to do for vacation this year. When my food came, my plate had to sit a bit off the edge of the table, because there was simply no room. Also, the wait was ~an hour. Our brunch was definitely leaning more toward lunch by the time we sat. The glass is half full though, because during our wait we discovered there's a super cute pet store next door with adorable puppy pastries.",

I met my colleagues who were already seated and the wait staff was pretty responsive and got me some coffee.  That was the highlight of the morning.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros which took a while and came out cold.  Now, how can a nearly empty restaurant serve cold food?  It's not like the demand was killing the kitchen.  This was not a case of lukewarm food but straight out cold.  The black beans that took up almost 80% of the dish were not warmed at all.  Straight out of the can, plopped onto the plate and out they went.  The replacement dish was better insomuch as it was warm but the issue now was that the dish was so bland and tasteless.  Absolutely no flavor and the beans engulfed everything.  I should have known better than to order this dish.  They avoid a one star because my colleagues food was marginally edible.  First Watch is opening locations in Charlotte so do yourself a favor and wait for them to open one near you.  Forget this place.",

They had been there prior and wanted me to have the experience.    It was difficult trying to choose just what I wanted to eat.  I narrowed it down to four items and finally settled on lobster rolls and a cup of soup.  Soups are made in-house and mine was a delicious blend of avacado. corn, and other things I forget but it was yummy.  Lobster roll was a pleasant surprise as they loaded the rolls with 3 ounces each of quality lobster.  All claws and arms.  They were so darn good I could not believe it.  And for $13 which I thought a deal.  Coffee is nicely on the strong side, the way coffee should be and refills kept coming.  You don't have \"your\" server but every server is your server and it works really well.  There were four servers and they worked seamlessly as a team.  And all were really friendly and not in a patronizing way, either.  Hard floor, walls and ceiling made it a noisy experience, so not a place for romance or conversation.    A place to return a visit.",

The eggs are fully cooked and then the other ingredients - cheese, vegis, etc - are entirely separate from the eggs and just folded in between plain cooked eggs. I have never had omelets like this anywhere else and the food came out so quickly that it makes me wonder if the eggs are not precooked and they just stuff the ingredients in when the order is placed. Bloody marys are mediocre. At my most recent visit, our one particular server was rude but I have not experienced this before so I am not sure what to make of that.   Bottom line: If you're in the area, it's a good place to grab a decent breakfast but this is not a restaurant that I would seek out.",

Actually, I've lived within walking distance of this and have never stepped food in this little shopping center.  Wow, looks like a lot of local gems in here.    Anyway, I'm here to experience Toast.  It was toward the end of the operating day so I was told I could sit anywhere.  I chose a place close to the window.  The decor of the place is simple with a few large pictures on the wall.  There is a wall of windows on 2 sides which makes it bright in there.  They left the door open so there were plenty of flies in the place which was a bit annoying.  So this is my first visit.  The menu has 2 sides with lunch fair on one and breakfast on the other. I had to ask if I could order from both being that I was in the mood for breakfast at 2pm.   So yes, you can order a late breakfast.  They get a point for that.  I decided to go all out here with a Boursin cheese omelette, hash browns, and a flapjack on the side.   The omelette was amazing.  It was a decent size but it was surprisingly light.  The cheese was savory.   The hash browns were more like home fries with big chunks of potato but still quite tasty.  And the flapjack was big and topped with powedered sugar.  Suprisingly, this was quite light as well but still very tasty.  Prices here are very reasonable.  For all I had, my meal came to a total of $12 and change, without tip.",

It was a little toasty (pun intended) -- but life of dog parents. Took awhile for us to get greeted, but after that, service was very quick. No one told me about the delicious cornbread and apples they bring you! Yum!   We both really wanted the Lobster Benedict but couldn't decide if $18 each was worth it. We settled on one lobster benedict and one crab cake benedict so we could have one of each. The lobster came out with fruit, and when I told the server who delivered it that we wanted potatoes instead, he immediately brought them out. Let me tell you. The potatoes make the meal here. They are super seasoned and delicious. The lobster benedict was delicious with the dill hollandaise. The crab cake benedict tasted a little off so I wouldn't get again.   Looked like they had a great cocktail selection even though we were there a little early for that.",

In addition, we only waited a few minutes before we were seated. This differs from my last experience when I arrived at 11pm. Parking was more difficult to find and I had to circle around once before I lucked into someone pulling out. That time we waited around 30-45 minutes. However, if you like games, there is a cornhole board outside available to pass the time while you wait.   Once seated, we received our drinks and our server was friendly. Toast adopts the philosophy that every server is your server so don't be afraid to ask anyone when you need something. We were missing syrup and another server was able to help us immediately. I ordered The Combo which included an egg of your choice, sausage or bacon, French toast or pancake, and an orange slice. I ended up choosing a scrambled egg, sausage, and French toast. My favorite part was definitely the French toast that was topped with powdered sugar. I would recommend this plate as it was a good amount of food for $10.99.   Overall I had a good experience at Toast and will probably be back in the future.",

Btw the Cali Benny is my go to (eggs Benedict topped with tomato and avocado with home fries).  I usually try to stay away from the \"common\" breakfast items when I go out to eat (eggs, toast, sausage), because, well, I can make that at home. However the biscuits and gravy here is amazing! It's one of the best I've ever had. It's creamy, spicy and cheesy. My husband and I always order a side of it every time we come here. Give it a try!",

    "text": "There's a guy outside dressed up like a piece of toast. How could you not like this place?!  The key phrase you must remember if you want to have brunch here: arrive early. They do not take reservations. Expect a wait. However, it's not so bad. Toast has a complimentary coffee bar (cute little paper cups) and cornhole outside. The place is hopping. Diverse crowd. Kids, families, boozy brunchers, dogs of all kinds.  Our group of seven arrived at 10AM Sunday. The wait for us was only around ten minutes. We were seated outside on the patio. Beautiful day for brunch outside.  I debated forever on my order. Basically, I fought with myself over which version of eggs benedict to get. Come on, there's nothing better than cutting into a soft poached egg and watching the delicious drizzle. I finally landed on the Cali Benny: Poached Eggs, Avocado, Tomato, English Muffin & Hollandaise. Great sauce. It came with a side of potatoes. I'm usually not the biggest fan of home fries, but these were seasoned and yummy. Didn't even need ketchup or hot sauce. I ate everything on my plate.  Quite possibly my favorite thing about this place: you pay at the counter. Think about it. When you go to brunch, you usually have to split your check up a bunch of different ways. Takes time for a server to do that, close everyone out. Here, you just take your check and go straight to the cashier. Makes turnover time for tables quicker.  I'm definitely a fan. If I can ever get my crew going by 10am, this is the place we'll hit up for some breakfast goodness. Now if only we could get the state of North Carolina to serve me a mimosa before noon on a Sunday....",

    "text": "Every Sunday after church my sisters and I usually go and have brunch. It's always the usual, \"where do you wanna go this time?\" With the usual response, \"I don't know\". And then we would usually hit up a safe spot with Vietnamese cuisine. Sometimes we would take a chance and go try an American restaurant. We usually don't go because honestly most of them are hit and misses. The option was between terrace cafe and the famous toastery. I had told my sisters I had already gone to terrace cafe that week and it wasn't somewhere I was jumping the chance to go again. We yelped brunch restaurants and found toast of dilworth.   When we got there there was about a 30 minute wait for the next available table. Meaning any table either inside or outside. There were people waiting inside and outside. It was crazy. We were about to leave thinking that the wait was way too long but decided to stick it through. Since we were with the kids we chose that option and got a table outside. They also allow dogs outside too! Although it was super hot and humid that afternoon, our servers made sure to check on us to make sure we were alright. I said servers because they have this policy where everyone of their servers are ours as well, which is pretty nice.   Although the place was jam packed busy, our food came out in a nice and timely manner. We didn't expect that. Our food looked great as well. It was definitely Instagram worthy. This review is about the service and the food. Our main server was great. I think his name was Danny. He was knowledgeable and personable and everything you would want in a server. And the food. Omg! So good. Although people would say that it's \"just breakfast\", there are two ways that could end up. It could end up just okay or absolutely delicious. Famous Toastery ended up delicious. The kids even liked it and they're so picky.   This will definitely be our go to brunch cafe from now on. Great quality food and service for quality prices. I mean, what more can you want?",

Service so far had been excellent and then we ordered coffee. Once we had used all our creamers, we just put the empty containers in the bowl they came in to keep them organized. Our waiter (Ryan) apparently did not like that and came back exasperated upon seeing this and just grabbed the bowl and sighed and said \"UGH and about putting your trash in our bowls...\" and he walked away. It was very uncomfortable and rude.   Whatever, I was there to eat! The food was incredible. From the stuffed french toast, eggs, pancake, toast, coffee. Everything. Not a thing that either of us ordered wasn't perfection. It was simply the rude service that was the problem. The rest of the time we were waited on by hit or miss other servers and just stared at by Ryan over the stupid creamer. I think Ryan was just mad about the way his life turned out.   For our gigantic quantity of food the bill was still under $30 and on our way out I let the very helpful and kind manager know about our experience and he assured me he would take care of it and assured me that that was not the atmosphere that they try to cultivate. So we will see. Either way it is totally worth a visit for the food!",

I don't understand how someone with that kind of attitude works in the food industry. When I asked her co-worker her name the first thing he asked was if she had been rude so this goes to show that she's like that all the time. She ruined our first visit to Toast needless to say that will be our last all because of Hilary. To the management, you should consider hiring a new waitress to take her place.",

The staff perfectly accommodated their squirmy two year old and helped Mom keep her happy with small cups and a single pancake. Frequent beverage refills helped us focus on our conversation. While we stuck to the avocado and bacon omelets today, there were many varieties of French toast (peanut butter and banana!) that will bring us back. And with fast service and dependably brewed coffee at the ready, why not?",

    "text": "Toast is toast.  We arrived very excited about a new breakfast place. I love breakfast! We left feeling foolish for spending money there.  The good: This is family friendly. I don't have children- but it is the sort of place that I could take my nephews to. The service was quick. We were seated quickly. It is large. The windows allow a delightful amount of real sunlgiht. It is pretty inside.  The bad: The food is average at best. You can easily go to a number of other breakfast hot spots in Charlotte and spend the same amount of money for something far superior. It is also very loud inside.  The ugly: EGGSHELLS IN OUR EGGS BENEDICT. Don't get me wrong- I know it can happen. We received the food so quickly- perhaps they just need to slow down a bit? My big issue wasn't the eggshell. It was the reaction to the eggshell. The server looked at us blankly and a little confused. I'm unsure if she knew what to do. They decided to comp our JUICES.  1. The manager never came by. It was obvious that the server asked someone about what she should do because she came back with saying that they will comp our juice. Ummm....isn't it the managers job to come by and check?   2. Comp the JUICES. Not the item that had the eggshells in it. That is just cheap. Maybe it is cheap that it irritated me. But really? The juices? (FYI- the \"large\" juice is rather small)  3. We had that weird feeling that if we argued our case- they would have comped the dish with eggshells in it. I hate that though. I believe in costumer service- not haggling. I just won't come back. I would have considered giving it another try if they had responded better (I am a sucker and will usually give a local place a few shots before crossing it off the list completely)  This place is all quantity- not quality.   The server did suggest giving us another crab cake benedict or another item. That is lovely and all..but really? When you are chewing eggshells you lose your interest in eating.  I couldn't even touch the grits. I am not a Southern woman- but I do have my standards on grits. It looked like microwavable grits with shredded cheese over it.  The crab cake benedict was blah. Very little crab. Add an English muffin and some asparagus, please.  I wanted to like this place. It is close to work. I just can't do it when there are so many better options in Dilworth.",

    "text": "Weekends in the Charlotte locale seem made for leisurely breakfasts, and restaurants open at that time seem to know and exploit this trend.  Toast is no exception and enjoys a current popularity with the age 20-35 crowd that makes this a pre-party and hangover recovery oasis, keeping a full house from opening till lunch time.  The restaurant is big enough to have a large mix of tables and seats at a bar, along with a small patio area outside.  It's a little too big to have that \"homey\" feel but then not large enough to feel like a pancake benefit at the high school gymnasium.  Service is team style as just about anyone could take your order , refill your drinks, and bring your order to the table.  Checks are also payable at both the table or at the bar where the cash register reigns.  These elements create a bit of tension between either considering this a more formal spot for breakfast or a diner where speed is the key.  I'm not sure what Toast is ultimately going for, but moving people through seems to be a priority.  The menu has a mix of omelettes, entrees, and a suprising number of \"eggs benedict dishes\" that are unique.  The Cali Benny with avacado and tomato, for example.  A trio of crepes also looked interesting, but heavy given the fillings.  I also appreciate their options for leaner breakfasts with egg whites, spinich, and turkey.  Again, the menu shows flashes of inspiration and skill, but the pace is that of a quick order grill.  This is not bad, it just feels a bit like an identity crisis.  While most of these more signature meals run in the range of $8-12 (a crab cakes benedict seemed king of price), I was happy and surprised to see that the standard 2 eggs with toast and a side ran just under $5.   The homes fries were a personal disappointment to me as I'm not a fan of fat chunks of potato in the morning, but they were seasoned well and they did seem to be popular.    Certainly Toast is currently a \"see and be seen\" kind of place, but you won't have to stay for long waiting to order and be served.  With the consistency and speed I've seen, they should stay popular for quite a while.  They are open for lunch and have just recently annouced plans to open for dinner, so it will be interesting to see whether this spot remains the \"toast of the town\" after that noon hour.",

    "text": "It seems like Charlotte has a shortage of non-chain breakfast locales. Sure, we have plenty of Bo Jiggles (Jangles), a few diners, and a handful of upscale breakfast/brunch locales. But how about the moderately priced? Toast fills that void.   When I worked in Huntersville a few years back I adored that Toast location. ADORED. I would swoon over the quiche, the fast, family like service and the adorable home the restaurant was housed in. Well, that location closed, and a few years later, now we have a Toast in Dilworth. The expansive space feels different, but the menu still offers a variety of breakfast and lunch items that will surely please the masses.  I stopped in on a Friday morning, so I had zero trouble grabbing a table. This environment is very, very different that the weekend. Pack your patient pants if you are looking for a meal on a Saturday or Sunday morning.   Service was friendly and quick and efficiently brought over my order - the strawberry and cream cheese French toast. It was a hearty plate filled with four diagonally cut French toast pieces, filled with the fair amount of sweetened cream cheese and a few strawberries. I would have preferred more strawberries and a bit more pizazz, but it was flavorful nonetheless. I chose sausage patties for my side and they sufficed just fine.   Overall, Toast is a solid breakfast spot and seeing the huge crowds it pulls on Saturday and Sunday alone, I imagine they'll do just fine.",

After last nights experience at the Toast in Davidson, why on gods earth would I go to the one in Dilworth for breakfast... Well the parental units wanted to take me out for a belated birthday breakfast.   Okay, the wait wasn't bad, the decor clean, the seats too small to be comfy... the staff ran around like chickens without their heads on. We had at least three-four different servers.   Dad ordered the crepe special.. nothing special there and luke warm. The sausage patty he said was really yummy. I ordered the Avocado omelet (avo, bacon, tomato, Parmesan cheese), but with egg whites only and with rye bread and topped with their salsa. I really would have loved the omelet, but it came out luke warm on the outside and cold on the inside because of the avo's... And not to mention topping off the omelet with cold salsa... really? Oh and my toast... cold.   The coffee was horrible! I mean crap! I mean shitty... it was horrible crappy shit. We all sent our coffee's back and opted for ice tea (and we were not the only ones).   The pancake was really good, their syrup is good, the potatoes were good (mom didn't like them as she prefers hash browns)  My food would have been really good had it been served hot. But then what put it over the top was the service... too many hands in the pot.. we had to ask for our check.. they said it was on the table.. NOT they never gave it to us.... whatever.   Will we come back... not anytime soon... they still have a long way to go to get their act together... luke warm food is NOT acceptable and mismanaged customer service is a no-no... I prefer my tag teaming done in the wrestling ring thank you.",

A month earlier I tried their Davidson location and thought it was pretty good so I was eager to see how the Dilworth location would be.   The service lacked care or curiosity. My husband and I went during a non-prime time and clearly the employees were cleaning up and restocking. Placing our order was uneventful and once we got our order the attention was gone. I had an issue with my side. It was roasted veggies, but it was clear they were overcooked and mainly red onions. I waited for a while to see if our server would return to check on us, but finally had to ask the person cleaning the tables if I could get something else. He signaled our waiter, got another side dish, and when our server brought it to our table, he just said is this what you wanted? Nothing about checking in on our experience, \"I'm sorry, was there something wrong with the veggies?...hope this will be better...\" The tomatoes on my sandwich were not good...you know when they are mealy, mushy, and flavorless (take it off the menu when it's not the season or make sure you import good ones). However, the avocado was fresh and very good.  I will give kudos for the manager strolling through asking tables how things were going. He just didn't pass by when things started to feel neglectful.   I could see Toast being a neighborhood food stop, but they missed the opportunity to build a relationship. Perhaps Toast is going for a hands-off approach, but it didn't work for us.",

A Sunday brunch after an extra hour on the clock and a Groupon offer, it's no wonder there was a wait, only 20 minutes for a table for 2 though. Fortunately it was a beautiful November day and the 5 outdoor tables were in use as well.    Just ran out of orange juice? Hopefully that means it truly is fresh...although i saw some food lion bags of OJ to the rescue...hmm.  Couldn't resist the Southwest Scramble, its hard for me to avoid anything with jalapenos. The Southwest Scramble was a perfect blend of spice and flavor. Seems like an easy thing to whip up at home, but it would never turn out like that. Egg, Chorizo, jalapenos, corn salsa with cheese melted on top and a side of potatoes. The potatoes had a little hint of something that distinguished themselves in a good way from being just potatoes.  The one thing that's not really my thing is that with all the people, this place gets noisy and for someone like me that doesn't have the vocal capabilities without alcohol to converse in noisy settings, it puts a strain on my meal conversation.   Service was tag team style. Efficient and friendly despite running around frantically. Our table was low on jelly and creamer type items, but they were quick to retrieve when you caught them running by.   All in all, It's not quite as cozy as the Davidson location but it's a much needed brunch spot for Charlotte worth checking out.",

Every server in Toast is \"your server\" so we always had full drinks and everyone was crazy nice. The wait for the food was pretty short, especially since the restaurant was slammed. My potatoes were super cold, and our main server was incredibly sweet and prompt, took care of it immediately and the manager brought me my fresh plate personally and even discounted my bill! It wasn't a huge deal, but they made sure that everything was perfect for us. They take their dining experience seriously, and it shows. The latkes were delicious. They came with creme fraiche and apple sauce and I ate every bite. I also ate all of my boyfriend's pancake while I was waiting on my food. It might have been the best pancake I've ever had.

Their breakfast menu ranges from traditional items like egg sandwiches, omelets, french toast, pancakes, etc.  I highly recommend any of those items because they are excellent.  Their hash browns are fresh cut potatoes with a very tasty seasoning.  They are wonderful!  But, what I would really check out would have to be their \"specials.\"  They had crab benedict, stuffed french toast, unique omelet blends, etc.  My husband tried the nutella and strawberry stuffed french toast.  Of course I \"encouraged\" him to order this because I had my eye on the pumpkin spice pancakes but desperately wanted to try that french toast!  Let me just say, we made the right choices!  The stuffed french toast was absolutely heavenly.  It tasted like a chocolate covered strawberry.  It is hard to explain but the bread balanced the \"sweet\" so it was a perfect combination of flavors.  You could always order a side of hash browns if you need something salty to complete the meal!    My pumpkin pancakes were the perfect fall treat!  They were super fluffy and the pumpkin flavor was very prominent!  I don't know about you but I have had pumpkin pancakes that didn't taste like pumpkin at all...it just tasted like cinnamon or nutmeg or allspice.  These were light and flavorful.  There were three of them, which was the perfect amount.  They weren't huge so I didn't feel lethargic, bloated and tired after this breakfast.  They mix things up so the menu is always changing.  I am thrilled that  they opened a location in Dilworth but taking a ride up to Davidson is a nice change of scenery as well!  Either way, check them out!  You will NOT be disappointed!",

Order was two scrambled eggs and toast, two scrambled eggs with mushrooms on a biscuit, two scrambled eggs with hash browns and lastly a plate of pancakes. What we got was a side of toast (not even brown), a single biscuit, three scrambled eggs with mushrooms and cheese with potatoes, and lastly two eggs over easy with potatoes on a pancake!! We tried to attract anyone's attention and eventually just left in disgust. Never going near this place again. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "I really liked Toast! The service was excellent and despite having a pretty packed house they were able to accommodate us without any wait.  I went with the lobster rolls which were delicious though light but I will say the cucumber salad lacked quite a bit. This salad was simply vinegar on cucumbers with dill...but the odd thing is it was served with a pickle spear on the side. Next time I'd choose a different side.   My dad had the coconut pancakes which didn't taste very coco-nutty but they were nice and fluffy and served in a heaping stack. My mom had a pretty killer breakfast sandwich that she loved, and my boyfriend ate his meal ( I can't recall what it was).  The sandwiches next to us looked fabulous, I will try the club next time.   I'd definitely give Toast another shot, especially for lunch!",

    "text": "I've been here twice now, once for breakfast and once for lunch. To be honest, I don't really understand the hype... it's just okay food with kinda quirky servers.   My most recent visit, I got a #5 burger topped with chili, cheese, and slaw. They have a lunch special of meatloaf and mashed potatoes, so I asked if I could substitute the chips that normally come with a burger for the mashed potatoes. They said they would see if that was an option. If not, I told them, I'll be fine with pasta salad. I'm not sure what they consider MASHED potatoes... but I ended up with hash-brown-like grated potatoes mixed with butter/cream like you would do with mashed.   They forgot to bring the slaw for my burger, which was fine. The burger itself was quite thick, at least 3/4\", but slightly over-cooked. I can't say it was the worst burger I've ever had, but certainly not close to one the best you can find in Charlotte.   My lunch companions, however, seemed to really enjoy their meals. The one who requested we come here for her birthday had a pancake, eggs, and bacon. She said they have \"the best bacon\", so maybe I should've tried something that included that...   Overall, unless someone REALLY wanted to come here (and it was their birthday), I would not choose to come back.",

Once your table is ready, you will be greated by a friendly server who will inform you that \"every sever is your server\" so you can ask for help from anyone in the wait staff.  To start, my friend and I ordered the classic Bloody Mary ($6.50) which was turned around quickly and was refreshing. They did a nice balance of seasoning without overdoing it -- I hate it when I take a sip of a bloody and all I get is pepper. Not the case here!   I ordered the Crabcake benedict ($13.99) which is only available on weekends. In short, it was amazing. Stuffed with real crab, hollandaise, poached eggs, and your choice of side. I chose the Hash Browns which were delicious and well seasoned.  Highly recommend for your next Sunday breakfast adventure!",

    "text": "OK... this place was a mixed bag.  Overall, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  Maybe after a management change...  The GOOD: - fresh OJ.  Smells and tastes like freshly squeezed.  Very nice - The front of house staff - friendly and on the ball - atmosphere - Feels like a nice, local breakfast place. - my well-done scrambled eggs came out well done and hot. - The coffee tasted a bit bitter when it first came out, but I'm guessing it has a strong Mexican bean component to the blend.  Once it cooled a bit, it was a nice cup of coffee.  Would be very nice if you like milk in your coffee.  The BAD (anything to do with the kitchen): - If your name has the word \"Toastery\" in it, you should really get the toast right.  The toast shouldn't come out as barely warmed bread.  One side of my 2 pieces was burnt, so maybe if you average the 3 'raw' sides with the one burnt side, it will equal out to 2 pieces of good toast.  They were so cold that the room temperature whipped butter on the table didn't melt when spread on the toast immediately after it arrived at the table. - Biscuits and gravy:  The gravy was barely luke-warm.  The biscuits were bland and felt rubbery, like they came out of a bag from a delivery several days ago.  If you offer biscuits and gravy as an entree, they should be baked in-house, that day. - Corned beef hash:  This can be a wonderful thing when crisped nicely on a grill.  The corned beef tasted fresh (strong flavor of corned beef), but unfortunately, this stuff looked like canned dog food that had been warmed in the microwave.   There was no crust at all, so it came out like a grey/beige mushy mess... Imagine a pile of oatmeal that tastes like corned beef.  Nasty. - Side order of potatoes:  Man... these things looked delicious when they came out.  A nice color and lots of little crispy bits.  I'm betting that they were really delicious about an hour earlier when they were cooked.  A bit of time in a pan before being served would have really woken these up.  Instead, they were an unappetizing mess.  We had a $35 check and enjoyed the coffee, tea, OJ and 1 serving of scrambled eggs.    I'm guessing that the kitchen has a steam table to keep things like gravy and potatoes warm so they can cook 'em in a large batch and have 'em ready for quick service.  Unfortunately, they forgot to turn the steam table on this Saturday morning (12/2/2018 at 9:30am).",

I prefer this Toast location over others just because of the layout, decor, and proximity to everything in Charlotte.  Atmosphere: Home-y, kitchy, comfortable, albeit a little loud.  Food: Reliable. Always good. I've had everything from the quiche to the breakfast burrito to the french toast. Is it the best thing you've ever tasted? Probably not, but it taste like mom's home cooking, only better! Also, the corn bread and apple preserves they start your meal off with are soooo good! I always want more.  Service: Awesome! All waitstaff serves every table, so if you need anything you don't have to wait for one specific person to come back and check on you.  This place is super popular for Sunday brunch, but surprisingly I don't think I've ever waited more than 30 minutes for a table.",

I ended up ordering the Southwestern omelette with hash browns. First off, I love potatoes-- any kind, and these were just great. For 10.99 you really got your moneys worth, the omelette and servings in general were pretty generous. My omelette has chorizo, tomato, peppers, cheese and I added mushrooms. I felt that the way my omelette was cooked was to perfection. I really appreciated that and the fact that the cheese was cooked to the point where it was stringy when cutting into my omelette.   Also, we ordered drinks at the restaurant which were SO good. Overall, the place is a great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch. Staff is so nice and the food is great and very reasonably priced.

Being one of my favorite brunch spots in the city, Toast serves up breakfast favorites with good prices and fantastic service.   Toast tends to be a popular spot on the weekends so be prepared to wait a little. However, they do serve up complementary coffee to help with the wait and we normally get seated fairly quickly. They run table service as a group and not an individual, which is actually really nice. Don't expect a 'tragedy of the commons' pitfall, but rather a well oiled machine that keeps your coffee cup from running low. My wife an I often like to split a main dish because 1) they are massive 2) there is no splitting fee and 3) they actually give a nice presentation. We did this on our most recent visit during snowmageddon '17 and it actually looked like they made 2 smaller omelets with a decent serving of sides. That makes room to get some of their delicious stuffed french toast!   Toast boasts a solid breakfast game and is a go-to for me with visitors or recommendations. Also don't miss out on their fresh orange juice maker (better known as a mimosa maker to me).",

With two eggs he only received one slice of toast.  Every other restaurant gives you at least two slices of toast with a breakfast order.

    "text": "I've given Toast 2 chances and will not be back. Both times the service has been bad, which is sad considering the disclaimer on the menu stating \"every server is YOUR server!\" Yeah? well apparently they are ALL terrible servers. The management, who was at the register the second time, had a terrible personality. I encountered the worst of the service the second time...I went in and stood at the bar (while waiting for our table) to order a Bloody Mary and some Mimosa's for my friends; after waiting at the bar (directly next to the cashier line) for 5 minutes and watching multiple servers come behind the bar and ignore me, I thought \"maybe I'm supposed to get in the register line to order.\" I got in the register line and once reaching the cashier and ordering drinks, I was told \"I can get your drink order after I clear the line, step aside.\" That was irritating, to say the least, and delivered in such a rude tone that everyone in my party had there jaws dropped when I turned to look at them. After being seated (I wanted to leave, but hey, I was starving at this point), we FINALLY were able to get our drinks. Our food was mediocre at best (both visits)...I've seen and tasted 8 different menu items so far (sampling friends food) and none of it was very impressive. Omelets are much better at Zada Jane's, Pewter Rose, even Skyland's! The french TOAST was not very flavorful and not as warm as it should have been. The actual regular TOAST (this is the name of the place) was cold and not buttered on both visits! (Of course they did give you plastic packets of butter that was cold and hard and would not spread on the also cold and hard toast). We have some great brunch places in Charlotte, for one named after a breakfast dish, Toast is awful.",

They started is off with a basket of their delicious corn bread...yum! I got their New Yorker which was one of their egg specialties (scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and onions) with hash browns and rye toast on the side. 'Twas quite satisfying and filling!

As a first-timer perusing the menu, nothing stood out to me as a \"must-have\" as the items were traditional breakfast and some regular sandwiches.   I opted for the base food items of: scrambled eggs, bacon, and french toast to see how well they do the basics.  Maybe this was the problem as they were just OK.  Nothing special but they were all cooked well.  I've also had better cornbread, but that's free here, so doesn't move the needle.  I also chose the gluten-free french toast among a few items where you can choose between that or regular, for no extra cost.  Thank you for that Toast!  My brunchmates got various scambles which you can get at most similar restaurants.  The Runner would have been my next choice though (turkey, brie, egg whites, mushrooms).  The service was also just ok, as we sat outside but we didn't feel rushed to leave as I'm sure we were holding our table longer than normal.  It was so 'not rushed' that nobody ever came to pick up the check and payment, until we had to flag someone down.  Maybe we were there so long our server ended their shift..  I would come back just for the brunching with friends experience, not necessarily to try the rest of the menu.",

After eating hash browns from my cousin's plate I ordered a side of those as well. The bacon, Lord! Cooked to perfection with so much flavor and the right amount on grease on it.

We also got one of the specials \"Holiday French Toast\" and it was way too sweet. My friend got the biscuits and gravy - and she said that was really good. I didn't try it, but it looked like way too much sauce for my taste.  I am saying A-OK because there was nothing wrong with it really. I just wasn't overwhelmed or impressed particularly.

The omlete did not inspire me to even take a picture.  It wasn't well presented, and the taste was just okay,not even great tasting. Nothing I could not have made myself.  Barely any avocado in it.  2. The hash browns were horrible. Too salty and not even hash browns more like smoshed country potatoes  3. Waffle was good, but that's almost impossible to mess up. 4. The bacon was soggy, and not crisp like I requested,  and wayyyyy too greasy. They didn't even blot off the excess fat.  One my friends there said the french toast was way too sweet, one friend ended up with peppermint toast, she did not order it, she ordered the regular one,said it was fine.   I had their coffee and a bloody mary... coffee was good, bloody mary was the worst!  Thank god it was not a 10$ bloody mary I would have been pissed.

I appreciate the wealth of vegetarian and GF options for those who need them.   Service was good, and the place was packed when we walked in, well after noon. It's a very popular restaurant for the Mahs Pahk and Dilworth folks. So after waiting for about half an hour, we were finally seated.  So why only 3 stars? It's just not that memorable.

In summary, we were disappointed. The food was unremarkable, at best. My friend's french toast tasted as if it had been frozen & thawed (you know that chewy texture) and came with so much powdered sugar on top that she had to request an extra plate to shake some of it off. I ordered the avocado omelet and found it to be rather flavorless. I felt like I was eating air. My other friend left most of her food on her plate. Even the coffee left something to be desired!   The servers are nice (you will have multiple during your visit), however one order was not correct and no adjustment was made to the check. The prices are reasonable, probably more so than similar dining options in town.   With all of the great breakfast options in Charlotte, it is not likely that we will return to Toast.",

    "text": "Most reviews say there is a wait on weekends. If you're looking to get in and out fast try a week day. Stopped by on a weekday around 7:30 (they open at 7). We were seated right away and from sitting to paying it was about 40 minutes.   During this time, it seemed like a lot of business people were there for meetings or grabbing a quick meal before work.  I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. I ordered two eggs, potatoes (extra crispy) and sourdough bread. The potatoes were amazing! They are red skins with a delicious seasoning - no ketchup needed. The sourdough bread was average. With the name \"Toastery\" I had higher expectations. I did like that the toast came plain (no butter already on it).   I had a bite of the black beans in the huevos rancheros dish and they were outstanding. Next time I go back, I'll be ordering that dish. They don't skimp on the avocado either. It looked like the give you a whole one. If you order this, make sure you're hungry! It's a generous portion.",

We have visited 4 times over the past month and were very disappointed.  The service has been terrible, and the food orders were mixed up 3 different times. Today we were seated and told that our server would be right over. 10 minutes later we were still waiting for someone to come to the table, no one came.  We walked out and I'm pretty sure they didn't even notice. We spoke to the manager after the 2nd and 3rd visits and were assured the poor service was unusual and we should give them another chance. Well, they blew that one, we won't be back.",

Coffee was on the better side of your regular breakfast joints. I saw a couple of other plates on the menu that looked very good as well. However, for a place called the Famous Toastery, I felt our sourdough toasts were actually the most disappointing part of the meal. They were not crusty at all and barely toasted. Overall a solid breakfast place and I'd want to come back to try other items.",

Service was good, you are greeted at the door with a basket of cornbread and jam and then taken to your seat. We got eggs, french toast and salmon bagel sandwich. All were good and tasty. Got coffee and grapefruit juice...this was one of the better tasting grapefruit juices I've had in a while. Also, if you get orange juice, it is fresh squeezed! Which is always great! So far one of the better breakfasts/brunch I've had in Charlotte, and good price as well. Your choice of indoor or outdoor seating and any server is your server, which turned out to be very convenient when waiting for service! Most other places are alot of hype and major let down, but I've decided I can come here again, I was that satisfied! Thumbs up!",

Nothing out of the ordinary, and the portions were small. We both asked for our eggs cooked medium and they were solid all the way through so we had to send it back. We weren't too bothered by this since they were more than willing to fix it- and they did. Overall it was just OK.",

And then we waited fifteen minutes for our order to be taken.  The server Frank rang In our order and brought the ticket back to the table (rang in at 11:10am).  Forty minutes in I inquired into our food, as several tables around us were getting theirs.  The server Frank gave attitude and said his was normal, and it would be five more minutes.  Fast forward to Noon when we inquired again and every employee was combative, trying to blame it on being busy.  Employees took no responsibility, showed no empathy, and got argumentative, so we walked out.  I'm a pretty easy going guy--I never send food back, and treat employees with respect.  If you can't make an omelette in FIFTY minutes, you need to find a new gig.  A table of people ahead of us had to get their food to go for the same reasons.  Ridiculous.  TLDR: Ridiculous wait.  Rude and unhelpful staff who got combative. Walked out. Not going back.",

Something about their food reminds me of being home on Saturday mornings and waking up to breakfast already made by my mom. Sigh.   Every time I've been here the wait has been shorter than 30 mins, including on weekends. The food also comes out pretty quickly. I'm pretty traditional with my food choices so I stick to the eggs, pancakes, and bacon. The pancakes are soooo good! I love that they keep it original and don't try a bunch of fancy recipes! What's that thing they say, \"If it ain't broke...\"  My favorite thing about this place is the serving style. Everyone is your waiter and I believe that's truly a best in class style that almost guarantees great customer service.",

My partner and I went there for breakfast, and we were happy about the convenient hours as they were open at 8:00 AM on a weekday. It can be hard to find a place for a sit-down breakfast during the week.   When we arrived we were immediately seated and informed that Famous Toastery uses a different service style, which meant that we didn't have one specific server but rather could ask anyone for anything. Since there were only two other tables I didn't really see any impact, positive or negative, of this service style.  I had perused the menu ahead of time for vegan options and saw a tofu omelette. I thought this meant that the tofu would be flattened, stuffed and pressed like an omelette--a vegan breakfast dish I have enjoyed before at other restaurants. But when I asked the server he said that it was indeed an egg omelette with tofu inside. WTF??  Since there were no vegan options, I settled on pancakes. There was nothing memorable about my meal, or my partner's.  Famous Toastery does have a full-bar, and was serving some yummy looking Bloody Marys. We won't be back, but if we did return, it would be for one of them. Otherwise, I'm unimpressed.",

They are housed inside of an office building and depending on where you enter in, you see a totally different side to the unique buildout. The customer service was phenomenal. We were seated in a timely manner and because of their setup, all of their team members serve your table. Our drinks stayed filled and our orders were right on time. They bring out the sweetest cornbread while you wait for your meal. Huge setup! You get full off of the cornbread because it's so yummy. Our meals were awesome. The gravy biscuits and eggs Benedict were amazing. To end our brunch, we met the owner who was so nice and wanted to ensure that we had a memorable experience. All the reasons why we returned a second day. This is definitely a staple to try for breakfast or brunch if you're in uptown Charlotte. It's within walking distance from all of the great hotels making it even more convenient. By the way...you can't beat their prices! Did I mention the Mimosas????",

I won't get into the details - suffice it to say, I've tried this place 3 times, and each time has been a 2-star experience.  One small detail I would like to give:  I ordered grits as the side that \"came with\" my breakfast.  The waiter asked me if I wanted plain or cheese, and I order cheese grits.  When the check came, I notice that they charged me .75 for the cheese for my grits.  What?  Yeah. Enough said.  Note to restaurant owners: if you have to nickel and dime your patrons like that, you don't deserve to stay in business.",

    "text": "This restaurant definitely needs a second visit from me... I cannot say enough great things about the service. On the menu it says, Every Server is Your Server. Totally True. Super nice waitstff, bus staff, hosts ... and everyone is genuinely helpful and never looks put upon if you ask them a question as they walk by your table. We brought all four kiddos to breakfast so I was totally skeptical about the ability to leave unscathed - or at least not have patrons throwing things at us - but really the attentiveness of the waitstaff made this experience seamless.  For food, this is almost a 4 simply because their array of GLUTEN-FREE items is unsurpassed in Charlotte. When I quietly asked about gluten-free options, the waiter rattled off a variety of options with ease. I wanted to cry when they asked if I wanted white or multi-grain toast with my breakfast. Toast is not something I have EVER been offered at a restaurant. Toast has gluten-free pancakes - they were so good that I thought maybe they made a mistake and gave my daughter the regular ones. Nope. They're just legitimately delicious. My other daughter ordered gluten-free French Toast. Yes. French Toast. Gluten-free. Delicious.   As for the rest of the menu ... I ordered the southwest egg scramble off the specials - it was pretty good. What killed it for me was the cold hash browns piled on top. Had I opted to replace the hash browns with a side of fruit, my experience would have been totally different. The hashbrowns were simply large chunks of lightly seasoned potatoes. Even if they were hot, I doubt that I would have liked them. Thankfully, my 7 year old polished off his combo plate and gladly took my hash browns off my hands. Unfortunately, we also ordered a side of hash browns for the girls to share. Also very cold. Kind of a bummer.   At the end of the day, the service was amazing, the food was pretty good, the gluten-free options were astounding, and our bill was $68 ... but only because it was too early for me to order a bloody. We will definitely be back - and hopefully I can give it a fourth star. The place was absolutely hopping so it appears that this place has legions of dedicated fans. I would love to become one of them... I'll try again!",

I live in Dilworth and have been eating at the bar there for some time on Saturdays. I went in today (10/11/'14), and two customers were seated at the bar. Every other place to sit at the bar was not wiped down and unclean. I sat alone at a table and when I was approached, I said, I usually sit at the bar but it is unusually nasty today. He had no comment and didn't go tell them to clean it up. I had a Southwestern omelette and it was very good. I ordered a tofu salad to go and was told he would put it in when I'm almost done. I never saw this young Black guy again. No water refills either. The male cashier came over and took my check and money. Another guy came and cleared the table. Still no to go order. Finally a young  lady walked by and I asked her to please check on my to go order because its been sometime already. I walked to the bar to wait and saw my waiter at a table eating. I mentioned to the lady  bagging the salad that he's sitting there eating, that's why I got no water. Still no one ever said a word about the long wait or the poor service. This was at 2 o'clock and the place was not busy. My check was $22 and I gave them $28. 30% tip for a truly horrible experience.",

The staff looks as if it was almost a surprise that it's the weekend and may be busy. They are either understaffed or simply not trained and can't keep up. The food is good - good meaning solid, not exceptional. The guy dressed up like a piece of Toast dancing around sort of gives you a weird vibe, but hey if they need the business at least they are going at it on a creative angle. There are a lot of families/kids - the acoustics are not exactly a quiet place to grab some coffee. All that said, I'm a big fan of local restaurants and staying away from the chains. Give it a shot. If they can up the service game, there might be something here.",

Tip for ya, if you go for brunch like we did... get there EARLY!!! It was crazy packed outside! But it was a gorgeous day and the way was truly about the length that they said it'd be.   All the servers work together so service was fast and accurate. They were all courteous and the food was pretty tasty. My only thoughts are that for what you get it's a little pricey, but then again we are in Dilworth so I guess that's to be expected.  They have some interesting choices, so I'll probably head back, but it's not at the top of my list. Maybe next time I need to go with something sweet instead of healthy. We all know healthy can be pretty boring. Hence why I still gave this place 4 stars. I got the turkey scramble and it just reminded me of something I could have made at home. It was eggs, cheese and turkey scrambled together with a cup of fruit and some toast. I was pretty jealous when I looked around and saw the mountains of pancakes and stuffed french toast.   Ambiance was nice and lively, food was good, and it is just a nice way to start a Sunday.",

They serve breakfast all day so I got the \"combo\". The flapjacks...my friends, they were amazing!!!! The combo comes with one flapjack or french toast with eggs and bacon. They have a variety of stuffed french toast and flapjacks. I decided on the banana nut flapjack with scrambled eggs + cheddar and turkey bacon. The best \"flapjack\" ever! Big pieces of fresh banana and crunchy pecans. It was big enough to cover the center of the plate but not huge. Just enough to make me full. Perfect breakfast for under $10!",

We were told 20-25 minutes and ended up waiting an hour. Fair enough for brunch on a Sunday but the hostess was rude when we came up to check in about how much longer the wait would be. Food was pretty good but the service we received made for a negative experience which is part of the meal. Probably won't be back. There are plenty of other breakfast spots in Charlotte with better quality food, service and pricing.",

    "text": "Toast has always treated me and my family right. Whenever my parents visit from out of state, they end up breakfasting here EVERY MORNING, and with good reason - everything is delicious! Bacon is thick and flavorful, and easily ordered to your liking (I.e. extra crispy, please!) Egg dishes are also good, but to my mind, the real star of the menu is the pancakes. The pancakes are highly-customizable...while there are a few specific versions offered on the menu, the servers explained to me that you can get them with any mix of ingredients that you prefer. My favorite? Banana + blueberry, yo! Always piping hot, full of your desired mix-ins, super fluffy and served with REAL maple syrup.  On one earlier visit, the kitchen did make a mistake and sent out my banana pancakes with nuts included (before I knew they'd put whatever you want in, I used to order the banana nut pancakes sans nuts). A server came by and noticed that I was picking the nuts out (which, it should be noted, were fresh and plentiful in number), and *insisted* on having the kitchen make me a new batch, correctly - even though I hadn't brought up the issue or made any big fuss. I thought that was pretty great customer service (also noted: my replacement 'cakes came out lightning fast). I also reeeeally like the 'every server is your server' policy.  Seriously, Toast - thanks for all the noms.",

    "text": "Toast!  I've heard about this place for a while and finally got a chance to try it.  I was pretty impressed, I must say.  We pulled into the strip mall-ish location at about 9:15 and we must have timed it perfectly because we were immediately seated.  By the time we were getting ready to leave, there was quite a line out the door.  So, word to the wise, get there early!  The menu had a lot of your standard breakfast/brunch things, but it also had some more unique items that you won't find at your standard breakfast joint.  I really liked that they had a few options that incorporated the wonderful avocado.  There was also a tasty looking smoked salmon dish, and the French toast looked pretty awesome as well.  I, however, didn't go with any of those things.  I got the Runner (egg white omelet with turkey, peppers, brie, and mushrooms).  It was really good and left me feeling satisfied but not stuffed.  It came with toast (hence the name of the place) and grits.  I love me some good grits, and these were done right!    The prices were pretty reasonable, most of the meals were in the 8-10 dollar range.  They had $5 Bloody Mary's and mimosas as well.    All in all, this place met my expectations and it will be on my shortlist of go-to brunch places in Charlotte.",

The check was placed on the table when the food came out, however we thought it was left on the table from a previous guest because the server didn't make reference to the bill. Therefore after we had completed our meals we sat there waiting for the bill until we flagged down a server passing by.  Also, my cappuccino fell over and splattered all over the table and no one came by to help clean up the mess. We had to flag down another server who eventually came over with additional napkins.   When we brought this information to the attention of the cashier she stated that all the servers work together. However, not a single server asked us how our food was or checked to see if we needed anything.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Charlotte for the first time. And we hope that this restaurant doesn't represent the service Charlotte provides.",

However, I got a standard Chicken Caesar Wrap and fruit and I was definitely pleased.    My second visit, this location was my restaurant of choice. I decided to try breakfast.  French Toast and Bacon. I mean you can't go wrong when bacon is in the equation.  The Cinnamon Raisin French Toast was a treat in itself. Not only could you taste the raisins, but the bread wasn't soggy (which you can easily get with French Toast).  The bacon wasn't greasy or too fatty. You could taste the actual bacon.   Since, I work uptown, this is a great location less than 15 min. to have a quick bite for lunch. I would definitely go here again.",

When she suggested it I looked at their menu and saw my favorite breakfast food biscuits and gravy.   One thing about me, I am a biscuits and gravy connoisseur. I have had them everywhere possible, and am on a mission to find the best biscuits and gravy around.   Since they only have it as a side I also ordered some bacon, thinking that it might be a small portion, like maybe only 1 biscuit. I was wrong, it was definitely 2 large biscuits. Plenty of food. The only problem was I didn't get my bacon. After 15 minutes the waiter came over and noticed, but by this point I had decided I didn't need the bacon. He asked if I wanted it, in which I said no, it was fine. He then said \"but I already charged you for it\". I gave him a look and he said reluctantly that he could take it off. Thanks?   The gravy wasn't my favorite. It was buttery or greasy, or something and brown. Not a big fan of brown gravy for breakfast foods. Brown gravy goes on dinner foods. (Did I mention I was raised in the South?)  I was also able to get a mimosa, a $5 special which was very good.   Overall, I would give them another go, just not the biscuits and gravy. Maybe stuffed french toast?",

    "text": "This place is an absolute must if you are in search of a brunch spot in Charlotte. I have been here many times and have always either gotten the Cali-benny or the huevos rancheros. THIS PLACE BY FAR HAS THE BEST HUEVOS RANCHEROS AROUND (see picture). No joke, they gave me goosebumps while I was eating they were that good.   They are always pretty busy, but if you can beat the rush (before ~11 am) there is barely a wait. However, if you do get stuck with an ~1 hour wait, there are plenty of stores you can walk in to pass the time (as they take your cell phone and will text you when your table is ready). They also have cornbread in baskets that you can take with you and eat while you wait, which is delicious. When you do get seated, they always have fast service. I had one experience where I ordered a cali-benny and as they were walking out to serve the food, one of the poached eggs fell on the floor and they decided to give me the plate with everything on it (minus one egg) AND THEN BRING ME AN ENTIRE NEW DISH WITH ALL OF THE FIXINGS. I was expecting to just get a tiny plate with one poached egg, but instead, they made the entire dish again and gave it to me free of charge.   The only thing I can negatively say about this place is that I am not a fan of their bloody mary's at all (as I would call myself an avid bloody mary drinker). It is my go-to brunch drink and unfortunately, it is never good when I order it from Toast (which has been at least 5 times as I always hope something magically changed). It is either always too watery, bland, not spicy enough, or too alcoholic (in a bad way). It kind of has that same blandness as if you were to water down Gatorade, you know the flavor of Gatorade is there but its hidden in the background. However, my friends order mimosas and considering Toast makes their own freshly squeezed orange juice (which you are able to watch them do) they absolutely LOVE them.   Therefore, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a new brunch spot and hasn't been! You will NOT be disappointed (unless you get the bloody mary, AKA just get a mimosa).",

The cheese over powered the flavor of the other ingredients. The onions were sauteed which was also different from what I expected but not bad. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite!

I put my name down with the hostess for a seat at the bar, which was full.   About two minutes later at 11:11 a couple left. So I was sitting there with the previous customer's mess in front of me from 11:11 until 11:26. If I had not flagged down someone walking behind me, I honestly don't think anyone who have cleared the place setting, wiped down the bar and basically made me feel welcome.   I almost decided to just there like a bump on a log that see how it would take for someone to realize there was a paying customer! I've never been so studiously ignored for 15 minutes. And no, I don't walk around with a stopwatch \"testing\" restaurants. I did it this time due to the unusualness of the situation.  15 minutes is a LONG time to sit politely and not have one single person say Hi or \"Someone will be right over\". This is especially egregious since their trademarked claim to fame is \"Where Every Server is Your Server\".   That was 180 degrees opposite to my experience. Frankly I would rather eat at some hole-in-the-wall dive with so-so food where at least you don't feel like you left your house wearing a cloaking device.   Unless someone tells me otherwise, I do believe that without paying customers, restaurants have no reason to exist. Unless the owner or manager reaches out to me about being totally ignored for 15 minutes, I won't be back and I won't recommend this place.   Charlotte has many other breakfast places where they acknowledge your presence, no matter how busy they are. 603-682-5888 David G.",

Brunch plates:  1) My go to is always the crab cakes Benedict. I LOVE that they used the crab cake as the base for this and don't even bother trying to waste my daily carb intake with English muffins. Overally just a great taste & great portions. 2) Avocado Omelette - avocado, bacon, Parmesan & tomato. This thing (as well as all their other omelettes) is loaded with toppings. You just cannot go wrong with bacon + avocado. Home fries that accompany most breakfast dishes are heaven . 3) Toast's Famous Stuffed French Toast - go for the strawberries & cream cheese. Savory to the max, this Texas Toast won't let you down.   This place is not a hidden gem, so expect a wait on the weekends.",

I do like that they have gluten free options as well, but the prices are a bit high. The popularity can prevent you from getting a table in a timely manner, but they do usually offer samples of fresh orange juice while you wait. Service is nice since you get waited on by everyone in the establishment. Everyone is very friendly.",

Our food was served at 12:35. That is a very long wait for Eggs Benedict and scrambles egg combo. His Benedict was hot but my meal was completely cold. We had then remove it and not replace it since it had taken 30 minutes wait time. The waiter offered to reheat it but that wasn't an appetizing suggestion.   Honestly, what was going on here? It was not that crowded but people were having to wait 30 minutes for breakfast & some lunch foods.   They took off 25% at the register after we mentioned the problem.   It was so much better back in the day!",

Well great I love trying new places so I was pumped. We picked this place after looking at the menu. Unfortunately wish we would of tried flying biscuit instead. We waited probably 15 to 20 min no big deal on a Sunday I'd say that pretty good. Ordered the crab cake eggs Benedict with a side of sausage gravy and biscuits. Others ordered a corn beef hash eggs with a pancake and then just other standard breakfast food eggs toast potatoes etc. We had to ask for refills of water at about 45 min in because our server never returned. This is when they informed us it was team service but there were plenty of servers standing around talking to each other but not one approached our table to update us on our food or refil our waters for 45+ minutes. We waited for probably an hour before our food came. All of the food except the corn beef hash came out cold. I dont know about you but cold eggs yikes. So the food all had to be returned. Then we had to wait for the food to be remade probably another 20 to 25 minutes. They did comp us half our bill hence the 3 stars. We heard them comp at least one other tables bill so needless to say others were also unhappy. I'd say it was average, I wouldnt return if ever back in the area.",

    "text": "How do you spend $100 for a reheated breakfast after waiting in the rain for the place to open an hour later than the website and door decal says? You come to Famous Toastery in Uptown. First of all, they do not validate parking. The public lot adjacent to the restaurant charges $5/30 minutes , plus an initial charge of $15 for \"event parking\" on weekends (i.e. a 31 minute park will cost you as much as $25). This cost, in addition to the fact that the Toastery's hours have changed to opening at 8 AM (only in their minds - everywhere it is written as of this review that they open at 7 AM) - can combine to make a costly outing for the determined diner.   The food preparation was abysmal. While in some cases they used high quality ingredients (the sourdough bread, lightly toasted, was excellent even though it was plated too cold to melt the butter), they fell short overall: the omelette I ordered was stuffed with raw, refrigerator-cold shredded cheese, greasy grilled onions, and a \"smoked sausage\" that looked and tasted like a diced hot dog. I also received a sad bowl of diced fruit that included browning, half-dried strawberries and slimy chunks of melon. My companion was presented with a side of bacon at slightly below room temperature, but came away nicely with pretty good grilled potatoes, scrambled eggs, and a nice biscuit.   The service was fine and I chose to tip generously; getting tips is probably an uphill battle for the people working at this place.",

We had a good meal very average with an above average price tag for the quantity and quality of food that they serve. First, the service of our greeting house and the wait staff was great. Second, the specials were well varied and interesting. We tried the cheddar grits and shrimp with added sausage. The grits were slimy definitely prepared according to package instructions. The Shrimp was Cajun and tasty. The sausage was less than desirable. It was not the usual sausage in this dish more of a hot dog sized red sausage quartered and placed on the top with grease poured on top to slide around the surface of the grits and fill the valleys left by the shrimp.  If you are used to try Southern fare this presentation is disappointing. Sanitation - This is the reason for the rating of 2.  Waiting for my food I saw a busboy use his hand an upper arm in place if tissue then open the kitchen area to stick that hand/arm with snot into the icemaker to fill up a translucent \"barrel\" then take the polluted ice to the drink station (soda) to fill it with contaminated ice for use by the entire staff serving iced drinks. When I told our waiter/host, he apologized that I SAW him do that and told me that he would talk to the busboy. Nothing else was done. Waiters continued to use the contaminated ice during our meal. Ugh!   To make matters more disgusting a second male waiter wiped his nose  with his hand and went to take orders from the table beside us. The food is good just don't look up at the fuzz on the cute lattice screen hanging above your head as you eat.  The bathrooms are cute but the toilet paper dispensers are in disrepair. I think the usual crowd has stopped paying close attention to the service that they receive and the cleanliness levels. I guess that is a good thing in thus case. Yum!",

I'm just enamored by the idea of mixing sweet and savory and the first meal of the day (can't beat that).  The idea of breakfast for dinner is definitely great for me... but I digress.  It definitely took a while to peruse the menu since everything sounded really delicious including there specials for the day.  I ended up ordering The Runner! Omelet that was a mouth-watering omelet made from egg whites, turkey, roasted veggies, and brie.  TOTALLY awesome.  My friend tried THE Avocado Omelet and said it was excellent as well.  I did manage to sneak in a side order of French Toast...as my treat for sweating out a 1.5hr hot yoga class (in the yoga studio located in the same shopping center).  Probably undid all the hard work, but I definitely enjoyed the sweet after a great omelet.  The omelets are served with one side hash browns, grits or fruit and toast.  I totally went hash browns (more carbs!)  Do you see why I love breakfast now?  Definitely have to come back here to try their other menu offerings... and maybe dinner.  I think they are open for limited nights...  Our server was very friendly.  My friends that live in the area said that they have been trying to eat here for a couple weeks, but couldn't stand the wait since it's been so crowded.  It worked out really nicely for a Saturday morning and we never felt rushed or anything.  I think a lot of other people got the tail end of the new opening grown pains... but our experience was great.",

The inside is full of dirty tables as well that no one seems to be cleaning up. This place wonders why there is so many people waiting a hour to sit down. It's so bad that a guy waiting with his family started cleaning the tables up so people could get seated to eat. There is also only 4 waiters and about 100 people here at the moment. The staff is rude and unfriendly and this will definitely be my last time at this place. The only person that was respectful and polite was the worker wearing the sandals and also our waitress. Took 3 hours just to eat breakfast from start to finish.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Oh lastly the omelet was made with bacon bits.",

I've been hearing about their imminent arrival in Charlotte and was happy to hear that they had opened this week.  I stopped by for brunch this morning and was greeted at the door by two members of staff.  The dining area was probably 30% full at just around 10:00am and I was told to seat myself wherever I chose.  The dining room was open with the bar on the left when you enter.  My server came to take my drink order as well as to drop off a basket of cornbread.  She was very knowledgeable of the menu and was even able to tell me what items I was considering used locally-sourced ingredients.  I decided on the stuffed french toast with peanut butter and bananas with turkey sausage and an egg.  Not more than ten minutes later, my food was out.  The french toast was over-the-top!  So good.  Fans of the PB&B combo will love this dish.  There were a total of four slices (four triangles) and I ended up having to take one home.  The sausage and egg were decent - nothing to complain about there.  The service I experienced was terrific.  I ended up being assisted by maybe three different members of their wait staff.  I have no problem with that, but it gives you pause when you're leaving your tip.  But that wouldn't deter me from going back.  Definitely worth a visit.  I'll be back!",

After we were seated and placed our order, the waiter brought our coffee and then never came back. After waiting more than 30 minutes and still no food or coffee refills, we finally were able to flag down another waiter to ask for refills and inquire about our food. He came back saying our order would be right out but we continued to wait another 15 minutes and still no food. We finally got up and left. I did speak to someone who seemed to be a manager on our way out, who said our order was coming out and asked if we wanted to take it with us. Are you kidding me? After waiting 50 minutes with no waiter or manager coming by to check on us or explain the delay, we were completely fed up. And we won't be coming back. Non-existent service and a \"who cares\" attitude! There are to many good places in town for breakfast to put up with that.",

I just moved to Charlotte and I've been searching for my brunch spot. I've recently adopted a gluten free diet... which sucks because i LOVE things that have gluten... like toast...   Enter Toast of Dilworth... There was a short wait to get a table... We grabbed some coffee from the bar for our wait. The coffee was nice and strong. It was a gorgeous day out so we stood outside and soaked up the sun. We were seated at the bar because we were ok with the first available option. We had three or four different people waiting on us, which was ok with me. I always had a full cup of coffee :) The orange juice was quite tasty.   The spicy scramble was good. A nice blend of flavors with a bit of a kick. I enjoyed my cinnamon raisin gluten free toast. It was nicely toasted and not gross and dense (like a lot of other gluten free breads).   Looking forward to returning!",

    "text": "The culinary world is a beast and extracts a high price to those who work in the field. It is full of long hard thankless hours pressed into service cooking to the masses. As a cook, you feel very much like Charlton Heston in Ben Hur, rowing on a galley ship awaiting the slave-master's lash or death. It is a feeling I am oh so familiar with thus, I am sympathetic to the plight of the line cook. Anyone who has worked in the hospitality field knows that there are three NEVERS: 1) You never know when your guess will show up 2) You never know what they will order 3) You never know how much they will eat. Any good General Manger, Owner, Kitchen Manger, Chef or Line Cook will tell you that. These are some of the fundamentals which will help you plan for a successful dining experience and help you to have return customers.  I am glutton for punishment. There I admitted it; that is why I play the lottery hoping some day I will ensure my good fortune and never have to work again. I, however, am not a glutton for punishment when it comes to dining. This could either be from a hip new food truck to an old pedigreed established restaurant. If the food is poorly done I most likely won't be back. This bring us to my latest dining adventure. Being still new to Charlotte we have asked for tips on where to find good food and have found most everyone loves Toast Cafe <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.toasthousecafe.com%2F&s=df365eddc90e91ff7ee6c5db207cc39322024c70988f189fee78a635dc2a4572\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">toasthousecafe.com</a>.  This well loved family staple has been serving the Charlotte area for years. I am trying to understand why? Okay, I may be sounding like a soulless elitists from California picking on the the natives of Charlotte but, rest assured, friends this is not the case. My wife and I first tried Toast Cafe shortly after we first arrived here in Charlotte. We where pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service from Toast Cafe. However on two other occasions our hopes have been dashed. Poor service and even poorer food was to be found in abundance when we took an out of town guess with us to Toast Cafe before the holidays on a busy Sunday morning.  Hoping that this was an \"off day\", we where willing to let things slide . Retuning today knowing on a slower day with fewer patrons amassing like a barbarian hordes we where sure that no mistakes would be possible. Right? Wrong!  How can you over cook toast and serve it cold with piping hot eggs and under cooked, cold hash browns? Or serve luke warm mushroom soup with an ice cold, semi-toasted meatloaf sandwich? This was after waiting 20 minutes for food that couldn't have had more than 8 minutes of prep on a slow day?  The General Manger did comp the meal so that was something I guess. Yes I maybe a glutton for punishment but, I am not stupid. Like Charlton Heston in Ben Hur, I will be watching the slave-master go down with his ship.",

Waitstaff was attentive and friendly. I had a mimosa, Frank had a Bloody Mary and he said it's the best he's had so far. Frank is a pain in the ass with his bloody Marys. So, I ordered the eggs Benedict with extra hollandaise sauce and it was delicious. They ask you how you want your eggs done with it and I asked for medium and they came a little bit overcooked but delicious nonetheless. They came with a choice of the usual and my fat ass has the homefries. They were good. Too. Frank had some type of eggs Benedict also but his came with tomatoes and onions and then avocado almost like it was a salsa. His eggs were perfectly cooked. He orders a side of fruit, boring fuck. Their coffee was delicious and I was very surprised. Nobody makes a good fucking cuppa coffee around here and I finally got one. Anyway the wait time was minimal for our food and we were in and out in the time it would've taken us to wait for that fucking table at the Tupelo Honey Cafe. But don't get me wrong I will get there eventually!! Toastery rocks and I will be back!!",

In 2019, it is time to start holding these places accountable for not even attempting to be environmentally conscious.   Each coffee came with 2 stirrers (despite spoons being readily available), ramekins containing salsa and fruit were plastic, the butter was served in plastic containers, the jam in more plastic containers, the silverware wrapped with paper napkins and then MORE paper was used to hold the silverware together. The creamers came in plastic throw away packets. The sugars and sweeteners too.   It is ridiculous. Recyclable or not, I'm done going to restaurants who are so lazy and cheap in what they buy for customers and who do so with a blatant disregard for being environmentally conscious.   Put jam in jars, scoop butter onto a plate, bring out milk/creamer in glasses, don't buy stirrers when you have spoons, go to cloth washable napkins. So many easy fixes.   And EVEN if you don't care about the environment, at least care about table presentation. Having a table covered in plastic, wrappers and trash looks and feels sloppy.",

But once we were seated, we did not receive our food until 2:45.  Others around us were getting their food before our table so we mentioned it to our waitress and she said it would be right out which we waited another 10 minutes for.  We were told they were busy because of All-Star weekend, but that is still no excuse for the poor and extremely slow service. When the food came out it was cold and tasted horrible. It was basically inedible.  The waffle we ordered was burnt at cold. So cold that butter wouldn't even melt on it.  Also the sausage that came with it seemed barely cooked.  The stuffed French toast was terrible and was also very cold and soggy. That also seemed uncooked.  I would not return to this location even if the food was free.",

We ordered mimosas and an orange juice and there were gnats in our drinks. Absolutely horrible. The food was average. And our waitress was not attentive at all. We had to constantly go up to the bar to ask for refills on drinks. But the fact that we only got 3 bucks off our entire order was crazy to me. Manager explained that she could not take the drinks off the bill, so taking one orange juice off was shocking to me. I definitely will not be back again and none of our family members will be back either. WE ALL DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT! And I only gave 1 star due to the fact that there is not a way to rate it a zero!!!",

It started when a 45 minute wait turned into an hour and 15 minutes, the last 15 of which we could clearly see our table unoccupied but uncleaned and would have been longer if not for us prompting the cleanup several times and eventually literally seating ourselves knowing that we were top of the waiting list. It took all our patience not to walk out several times- unfortunately we had invested so much time already we kept thinking \"surely it can't be much longer now\"  Then we had to ask to order, ask for water, ask for cornbread despite other tables next to us being seated later and already served. We had to remind them 3 times about our juice orders as well.   At the end a different waiter apologised, and explained the computers had crashed.Why didn't they just explain at the start?  We could have gone home instead and come back a different day. Unfortunately now, our experience was so bad we will never brave toast again.",

I wouldn't say its my favorite breakfast spot or that I ever crave it but I will never argue going there if thats where others would like to go.

The wait was 45 minutes to an hour and no room at the bar/inside.  We waited outside and found they had a complimentary coffee bar and cornhole!  Very nice touches!  There were a mix of tables inside and outside and when we were seated we got one of the nice outside tables.    The food was great.  I had the runner omlet which was packed full of veggies and turkey meat.  One thing to note here is that service is what they call team service.  So most of the time you don't have just one server, you can have numerous servers and they all treat you as if you are their table.  This service can have pros and cons, but mostly we felt taken care of from everyone.  They know their clientele and definetly deliver in food and atmosphere.

We were thrilled when the Dilworth location opened.  I have now been to this particular location 5+ times and I'm still hooked.  This is by far one of the best breakfast locations in the Carolinas.  The only breakfasts I would even rank with the quality of food and service would be Poogan's in Charleston and George's Brasserie in Charlotte.  My bride orders the Raspberry Walnut Pancakes with Bacon and she can't branch out for new dishes because they are just that good.  Very fresh and they don't skimp on the ingredients.  These are also my favorites of the pancake and french toast selections.  I've tried the basic breakfast, the Cali Benny (avocado, tomato, poached egg, hollandaise), the Crab Benedict, Eggs Benedict, Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich, and many more.    I'm still highly impressed with the service and your cup of coffee never empties.  Excellent teamwork.  We bring our family here when they visit and they request each time now as well!  *Another visit update... We went for our first Sunday visit and had to add onto my review.  The floor service is a well oiled machine.  There was a 25 minute wait for our two top and they manage to turn service without making you feel rushed.  As soon as a table frees up, they had it bussed, cleaned, and seated within 2 minutes.  Excellent food as always including a special : southwest scramble.... Awesome.",

Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant owner Brian and offered to take a seat wherever we wanted (menus are already on the tables).

There was a LOT of perfectly ripe chunky avocado on it, which was a tasty treat.  The accompanying homefries are delicious, too.  They're cooked just perfectly with the right amount of seasoning, and not too greasy.  They tasted even better with the soft egg yolk that oozed out of my benedict!  Yum!  Our servers were fantastic and attentive (again).  My (big) coffee mug and water glass were never empty.  The owner stopped by to check on things at our table, too.  Everyone was very friendly.",

My only suggestion is a better coffee bean used because as a breakfast place I think coffee should be extra special. Good for brunch, the woman accross from me had a Bloody Mary that looked great. I wish I lived much closer because Id go here often. Try it out!",

    "text": "Socialist breakfast.  Overall the quality of the food is decent, but not gourmet. They serve basic breakfast foods that are prepared quickly.  Be prepared for sub-par service. The Toast business model is to use a \"team\" of floating servers, food runners, and busboys. Our first interaction was with Eric who took our order, then we never saw him again during our visit. Near the end of our breakfast (approximately 25 minutes) we had our first coffee refill. The table to our left had an issue with their meal due to the fact a wrong order was brought out and dropped off then the food runner ran away quickly and they had it sitting on their table for five minutes. The table to our other side had a patron that had to walk to the bus station to attempt to get himself a coffee refill. There is apparently no incentive to provide fast/friendly/quality service if they share the service responsibilities. We paid $28 dollars for an omelet, French toast and two coffees. A Socialist Breakfast.",

I didn't see the item on the menu and asked our waiter about it and was told it was a weekend special item which was totally fine because I wanted to try other items as well that was on the menu but the waiter was nice enough to go back to the kitchen to see if they can make it happen and that was really sweet of him. Hashbrowns are delicious and the flapjacks are so good and fluffy. Overall great first experience",

I was surprised to find that it's pretty big inside. I imagined it to be a little hole in the wall, but it's actually a huge place with inside and outside seating.  Not particularly interesting visually speaking, but you don't come to a place like this for the looks.  As for the food, I went a little over the top with my selection.  They were having a special of Lobster Eggs Benedict, with I think Canadian Bacon underneath.  It was fantastic.  The lobster was fresh and savory, and the ham's saltiness complimented it well. It came with their version of hash browns which were really home fries. They were also really nicely done, with a lot of flavor, although what exactly they had in them I couldn't say, just that they were great. I did have a bit of my buddies pancakes, and they were a solid choice too, but I'm pretty sure he was jealous of my huevos.  The service was quick and friendly too, and as others have commented, they do a team style service, which makes things faster, but I also think it takes away any chance you have of developing a friendliness with your server.  No complaints though, and I'll be back I'm sure for another visit to see what else they've got on the specials menu.",

The prices aren't bad either. Toast also has a location in Davidson and a new Toast is set to open soon in Ballantyne. The menu is diverse yet simple, creative but not fussy. I really like the lobster roll - above - which is not something easy to find in the south. I also dig the omelets including the avocado omelet with bacon and parmesan - so delicious - and the complimentary cornbread and apple butter served during weekend brunch. I love that I can walk to Toast and that they are so busy - we recently waited about 30 minutes for brunch - hopefully this is a sign they will be around for a long time. I look forward to returning again soon to try even more items - if I can bear not to have my favorites!",

It would be nice to see some variety in their menu options, perhaps less meat or chix laden. Most of the time the service is pretty good. On our last visit, two waiters tried for my plate before I finished eating, with my fork in hand and one finally got it ;)???",

I got the crab benedict with hash browns.  Their hash browns were delicious, soft and slightly garlicky, and I never knew how well crabcakes and hollandaise went together... it's gotta be the splash of lemon juice.  Mind you, the hash browns are cubed and soft (more like \"home fries\") and not fried shoe string (a la IHOP).  I think this is an important distinction given I know people loyal to both camps.  The only slacker was the coffee, which tasted like it might have been sitting on the burner a bit too long. If I recall correctly hubs got the boring breakfast (he almost always does), toast, eggs, potatoes, meat, juice.  He was satisfied if not blown away.  Also he's in the shoestring hash camp.  Well, my food was good enough that I'd come back.  Although I'm starting to wonder where I can get a knockout cup of decaf with brunch...",

    "text": "Nearly everything about my experience was a huge disappointment.  Having been to the original restaurant in both Huntersville and Davidson I expected a bit of a wait going during the weekend at 10am, but a 30+ minute wait while at least there were at least a half dozen empty tables is inexcusable.  And things didn't get any better later in the day, I saw people waiting for more then 30 minutes when we left after 12 with just as many tables sitting empty.  Then if was nearly 10 minutes before someone came to take a drink order and they disappeared before we could place a food order.  So 20 minutes later we finally got our order in.  But 45 minutes after that our food still hadn't arrived.  The waiter said it would be coming right out and it did, but it was cold.  So I doubt I will be back.  It's a shame because I loved the original Toast but I have heard some bad reviews of the franchisees.",

The place was busy, but we didn't have to wait.  I got an omelette with tomato, bacon, and avocado.  It was very good.  The side of grits was good, a little bland (liked most restaurants).  Fixed that with some butter, salt and pepper.  My wife got the corn beef hash with one egg.  It was the highlight of the meal.  The hash wad perfectly seasoned and egg was perfectly cooked.  To top off a great meal, the service was exceptional. Truly.  It's like every server in the building is your server.  Drinks were refilled instantly.  Empty plates were cleared instantly. Checks brought out at they perfect time.  We never waited on a single thing.",

The staff was very accommodating  with our group, assisting with moving tables as the group grew and having patience taking orders as people arrived at various times. I ordered fruit and hash browns at the same time as others around me. I was the last to receive my food and my hash browns were luke warm at best. While they had a good flavor, someone obviously forgot my food when it was ready. I would've rather they made me wait and served hot food.

We arrived and were told 15 minutes or so, so we wandered off into the shop next door (Tuesday Morning, it's like a homemade Home Goods! Check it out!).   After we were seated, the Lady and I both ordered off the specials menu; I got the Crab Salad Rolls and she got a Crab quiche, and then I ordered the godly candied bacon w/ a spiced rub. Holy hell that was good.   Toast is a really cool concept (the whole \"everyone is your waiter\" thing), and in both locations they've delivered quality food in a timely manner. We'll continue to go back here, and I'll update my review once I see consistency. Nothing against you Toast, keep doin' what you're doin'.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised with everything about Toast of Dilworth (TOD).  My experience at TOD yesterday was like putting on a pair of jeans you haven't worn in a while, reaching in the pockets and finding a $20 bill.  You don't know where it came from, how it got there or even how Long its been there.  But it doesn't matter, you accept it as good...  Went here Monday July 16th.  There was plenty of parking.  We did not have to wait at all for a table.  In fact we were able to choose any open table we wanted to sit at.  As I was trying to decide what to order, I was torn between ordering breakfast or lunch.  I think it says something positive about a restaurant when you look at the menu and there's five or six different items you want to order and they all sound delicious.  Well, this is exactly how I felt as I looked at TOD's menu.  I finally decided to order the grilled chicken wrap with roasted red peppers and mandarin oranges that was the Monday special (see pics).  My date ordered the Chicken Cesar Wrap.  She was torn between that and four or five other options as well.  I will say, it seemed like it took a while for our meals to arrive.  But once they were placed in front of us...WOW!  The grilled chicken wrap that I ordered was stunning (see pics).  Its difficult for me to explain exactly how the succulent grilled chicken, roasted red peppers and mandarin orange all came together, because I have NEVER experienced a taste sensation such as this.  The cold slaw was unique and unlike any other cold slaw I've had.  It tasted liked it was made two minutes before being served to me.  It was the perfect combination of fresh, crunchy, cold, and sweet.  My date's Cesar Wrap was not quite as tasty, nor quite as unique, but still above par.    The service was super.  They have a sign that reflects their service policy.  It reads, \"Every server is your server.\"  This was truly reflected in our lunch experience at TOD.  We were sat by one gentleman, drinks were served by different lady, food orders were taken by a different dude, and our meal was brought to us by yet a third guy.  Everyone we came in contact with was cool however.  No issues at all.  ...kinda like that $20 you found in your pocket...I don't know how or when Toast arrived on the scene and I really don't care.  This place is damn good, and just like that $20 I found in my pocket, I'm keeping it, and I'm not asking any other questions.    I AM A FAN OF TOAST!",

The menu sometimes can seem overwhelming I always struggle with what to get. So, needless to say I have tried a variety of items, eggs, omelets, crepes and pancakes, along with several side items. The eggs are always great, how can you go wrong, right? As for the omelets, every one I have ordered has been wrong, and isn't anything special. The mushrooms seemed canned, and the peppers and onions are always overcooked, never with a fresh crisp taste that you should have.  The pancakes were great, light and fluffy. The most disappointing items I have received consistently are the potatoes, or home fries and the english muffins. The potatoes are not worth it. Always underdone, dry and just wrong.  Please learn how to make home fries, and learn how to keep them warm.  As for the English muffin, please learn how to \"Toast\" one.  I have yet to receive one that is pretty much right out of the English muffin box.  Overall, I still am not sure what the hype about this place is.  Expect a long wait time, shotty and random service and decent food.",

Nice location and clean place. What could have been great was pretty boring. We both noticed the smaller serving of what could best be described as eating at home for us and lack appearance. Except my husband who usually makes breakfast knows how to season the food. His eggs benedict is much better.  With salt and pepper in hand after tasting- I immediately went to work adding flavor to my meal. Everything was pretty bland and lacked any seasoning. Dark dark coffee which we both didn't care for. Expensive too for us we would have paid a lot less elsewhere- Even at our hotel buffet breakfast. Truly sad as they only serve breakfast and lunch- and we had high hopes for this place",

Now I love cheese, all kinds and Boursin is one of my faves to eat on crackers and with fruit. So when I came across this omelet on the menu, I had to try it and boy was it good. They put big heaps of the cheese in the omelet along with big pieces of crispy bacon and chopped tomatoes. I added onions and mushrooms, you know to start the new year off healthy. I got a side of \"hash browns\" which are just big chunks of potatoes. There's a $1.99 up charge if you want to add a pancake or French Toast. Btw if you add a side of French toast, you get 4 pieces. Overall great brunch to kick off the new year and cure a hangover!",

(Which is not to suggest that Toast is *only* breakfast!)  At 10:00 in the morning, I was wanting something delicious. And since I can't go to the Flying Biscuit at the moment (don't ask - it's cool), I let my Yelp app bring me here instead. Not much of a crowd - three other tables had some folks at them. Some mommies at two, a business meeting at another. And me, a table of one.  What to have? What to have? Eggs, of course. And toast, of course. What arrived a short while later was a mushroom and cheese omelet with two half slices of sour dough toast. The omelet was perfectly cooked and the toast was perfectly toasted, but to be honest, I was a little sad that a restaurant with the name of Toast only gave me a single slice that was cut in half. Sad face.  Service was friendly and good. Plenty of good coffee. The wifi worked great and I sat there for a good 45 minutes until my battery ran down.  I'll be back!",

    "text": "I would give the serivce a solid 5 stars, the food 4 stars and value 3 stars.   My wife and I visited Toast for the first time today for lunch. Having been huge fans of Las Ramblas, we were amazed by the transformation of the room. Nice job, Toast.   My wife ordered a breakfast sandwich with a side of hashbrowns (really homefries in my opinion) and I ordered the Left Coast BLT (hold the brie).   Service was quick, as was the kitchen. We were attended to by multiple servers throughout our experience there and all were very friendly.   Our food arrived and my wife's sandwich arrived exactly how she ordered it and she said it was very good. Mine, however, arrived not toasted, despite being assured it would be toasted when I ordered it. OK, no problem, a minor hiccup which was corrected very quickly by the efficient waitstaff.   I wished, however, that I had actually looked inside my sandwich before sending it back for the toasting. When it arrived back I bit in and realized it only had 2 slices of bacon on it. Now, I should mention, the menu price for this sandwich is $8.95. Seriously, 2 slices of bacon on a $9 sandwich billing itself as a BLT???  I quickly got the attention of one of our wonderful servers and asked, \"does this sandwich always come with only 2 slices of bacon?\" Yes, he answered, and immediately offered me more bacon. Within a minute or a so, a plate arrived with 3-4 more slices of bacon. Now that is superior service...very impressive!!   Still, with a 20% tip, this turned out to be a $30 lunch, for 2 sandwiches, 1 side of homefries (oops, hashbrowns), 1 mimosa and 1 sweet tea. That's pretty steep.   Had it not been for that level of service, this would have been a 1 star review all the way.",

    "text": "Ate here on a cold winter day. Very crowded and rather noisy.  Lots of cold draft from the ever-opening and closing front door.  Wait staff was very good.  They got the orders in and out in spite of the large amount of people.  Got the eggs Florentine.  The eggs were well cooked, but it came with a glob of home fries that lacked seasoning.  My cohort had the Crab Benedict.  Eggs were well prepared except they didn't drain the eggs well enough and the crab cake below was soggy. The meal came with stale, cold cornbread in a plastic bowl - how charming.  The coffee was great though.  The biggest disappointment came last - the bill.  This place is overpriced.  I can say that they do have the basics down and with a little more attention to detail, this place could be great.  Won't be in a big hurry to go back, but if I'm in the area I might try them again.",

    "text": "I won't be back....  I was really looking forward to Toast opening in Dilworth as I have had good experiences at their former Huntersville location.  Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed.   My toast experience started out with a long wait for a table which is just fine.  I figured the place must be good with so many people waiting to eat there. I was wrong.   Our first impression started with the coffee which was Horrible. And I do mean HORRIBLE.  It was so nasty that it was undrinkable. My Dunkin Donuts coffee induced urine likely has a more pleasant flavor and aroma. The manager said that the coffee comes out good 75% of the time.  WTF?  How the hell is that possible? The corn bread was extremely dry and had a flavor that I can only describe as \"fecal\".  Wash that down with the coffee and it's like someone took a dump in your mouth.   The service was very poor.  It was some of the poorest that I have come across in a long time. After 40 minutes our food was finally delivered.  If you are going make me wait that long at least give me the option of ordering a bloody mary or a mimosa to numb the pain. I ordered the breakfast burrito.  It was cold and utterly tasteless.  My hash browns were mediocre at best. And the \"homemade\" salsa was anything but.  It tasted like the cheapest mass produced salsa available that they then added some red onion to. Evidently according to Toast throwing some onions in there makes it \"homemade\".    To sum it up, there was a long wait, horrible service, and terrible food. Perhaps Toast doesn't have all of the kinks worked out yet.  However, there are plenty of other places for brunch nearby in Dilworth that are consistently good. Fortunately I was using a Groupon.  But even at half price it wasn't worth it. I will not be giving Toast another try.",

    "text": "Met some friends here on Sunday after church for the first time. We had about a 35 minute wait for a four top. Here \"every server is your server\" but I could see how easy it is to be forgotten about. My coffee cup was empty while I struggled to make eye contact with one of the many servers running around to ask for a refill. I had the two eggs and bacon. Eggs were cooked over medium like I liked but the edges were little hard (as if cooked too fast), bacon was nice a crispy with good flavor. I also ordered a side blueberry pancake which was tasty as well. You could actually taste the wild blueberry flavor unlike other blueberry pancakes I've had before. Over all... Nice time and enjoyed brunch but not one of the best breakfasts I've ever had and a bit over priced.",
