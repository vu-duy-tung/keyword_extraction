    "text": "It take a lot for me to really go off on a place.  A LOT.  But Brazewells has earned my displeasure.    Let me start with at least one positive.  Kelly, behind the bar, is awesome.  She's friendly and knows her stuff.  And that, my fellow yelpers, is where the redeeming qualities end.  Rarely have I been where the waitstaff was so clueless and uncaring.  \"May I see a wine list?\".. \"Oh, uhh.. well, we don't really have one right now... sorry.\"  *crickets*  Are you kidding me?  if I had been here once and heard this, I probably wouldn't mention it, but over a 3-4 month period, I heard this more than once.  My other major complaint is that many of the servers are just rude.  I'll grant, however, that if I had to put up with the usual crowd they draw, I may be, too.    After visiting this place on a Saturday night, I knew it'd be my last visit.  The back patio was WAY overcrowded and packed with self-absorbed douches.  Rudeness gets elevated almost to an art form back there.  Beware, they also allow smoking back there.  Just.. eww!  As we were trying to leave, I had people actually refuse to move so that I could step down off the patio.  Seriously??  Why are there bouncers here?  All they did was watch as I struggled to navigate the insanity.  Skip this drunk and douche infested place and walk across the street to Ten Park Lanes, instead.  You deserve better.",

He obliviously lacks the correct training or education to manage in any business, he needs to choose a different occupation. Maybe the owners should help him with that decision or they'll end up losing more customers.",

One side and 2 outside so it is pretty easy to get drinks. They play great music and they have TVs outside so you can catch any game you want.   The service has been great both times I went.

Their patio is GINORMOUS and it's a hot spot for young 20- and 30-somethings as well as a neighborhood watering hole for some of the older crowd.  The crowd reflects the staff--cool and laid back which is a welcome breath of fresh air from spots around town that try to be something they're not.    Brazwells is the kind of place you could meet up with anybody from a first date to your roommate's crazy Uncle Ed visiting the big city for the first time.  Some call it the Whiskey Warehouse of Montford (same owners).  Sandwiches, salads and meatloaf aren't supposed to be this good at a sports bar.  The prime rib sandwich and sweet salmon salad are excellent.  The wings are average, but still good.  The atmosphere is the best part about this place, the more I go the more I enjoy it.    There's a lot of variety from during the week (don't be surprised if it's packed on a random Tuesday or Wednesday), during the day on the weekend and on Thu/Fri/Sat nights when it's typically standing room only.    Oh, and don't forget half priced wine bottle Tuesdays!",

I have had the chance to visit it late night yet, but have been after work for a drink or two and it's a very laid back atmosphere!

It's lovely, quietly populated (during Memorial Day Monday lunch) & well-shaded!    They have a great outdoor bar area & lots of seating.  Lots of good TV's on patio which is nice for various sporting shows.  The menu was varied and was much better than standard bar fare.  We tried the wings (a lb is about 8 wings) which were ok.  I like others better, but these weren't bad.  I had the salmon salad which was really good.  Not necessarily the freshest, but cooked really well and tasty.  The chicken sandwich was very juicy & tasty.  Skins on fries aren't my favorite.  They're saved a bit by being skinny ones.  They could save them a bit more if they crisped them up a bit more.  All in all...above average food for a good sports bar.  Servers were experienced, which is a plus.  I'd go again.",

    "text": "Since my usual watering hole is closed on Mondays, I was looking for something new and someone recommended Brazwell's.    The first problem with any business on Montford is the parking situation but I lucked out here and found the last space in their lot.    Inside, I wasn't really greeted.  There were two girls standing at the hostess booth chatting away.  Finally they just looked at me like \"How dare you interrupt us\" and I mentioned I'd just go to the bar.  This place reminds me of a Cheers-type place with lots of dark woods, some brick and then TV's galore around the inside.  Unlike my experience at the front door, my experience at the bar was quite different.  The bartender was friendly and helpful with the menu and the beer selection.  My usual disappointment came with craft beer.....OMB is the only local beer represented here but I branched out of my comfort zone a little with other craft beer options.  The bartender also pointed out that before 6pm is 1/.2 price appetizers and wings.  Wings are by the pound with 8 wings per pound.  I went with 2 lbs of wings with a Buffalo cajun ranch sauce and something called Barbalo which is a barbecue/buffalo mixture.    The wings were big and juicy and lightly covered is sauce, just the way I like them.  Unfortunately, they missed the mark on spice level.  But there's plenty of other menu options to explore on this menu.    Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the bartender.  I would give the place another shot.",

I was sitting next to my fiance and his white friend with his Asian friend across from me. The female bartender asked if we were ready for the checks but didn't ask how they were split. I guess since she assumed I was Asian, I was with the Asian guy even though I wasn't sitting next to him. She put our checks together and my fiance and his friend separate. Really? That's pretty rude and ignorant. When my fiance told her we were on one check she just said \"oh\" without apologizing.",

    "text": "Got to experience this place as we decided to come here for a drink while we waited on our table at Good Food. I'm less than pleased with the service. Our waitress was fine at first but when the rest of our party arrived it was a sudden attitude change. We opted to sit on the patio since we were just going to stay for drinks. When we decided to stay for dinner the service completely went down hill. Our waitress would ask if we needed anything and before we could even get a chance to respond she responded, \"no, okay good\" and walk off. We all looked around at each other because a majority of us either had a question or needed something. As for my meal, I ordered the veggie wrap with a side of veggies. The waitress said, \"You realize the veggies on the side are the same in the wrap? I figured this was the case but didn't expect the attitude so I responded, \"I figured, lets doubt that veggie intake.\" We got our meals, but not all at the same time. 2 of the people in our group did not receive their meal with everyone else and ended up waiting at least 10-15 mins later. The price for meal was fine, but the service really killed the experience. My only advice for anyone coming here, don't sit in Alana's section. I really hope she was just having an off night and that's not her normal attitude. Two stars were absolutely for the food and price.",

A bit of a turn off if you ask me. Another turn off is when I am thirsty and can't get a drink in a timely manner and when our server takes our cards to pay the tab and doesn't come back for a good 15 minutes letting us think that she skated off to South Park mall to go on a shopping spree.  Nice patio though, it was bumping for a random 70 degree weekend day in Charlotte but the crowd sure enough changed to the trite early 20's crowd with too many popped pastel colored collars for my liking. Food was decent--as stated before we started off with the nachos which were surprisingly delicious and I had the buffalo shrimp appetizer. They had wallet friendly drink specials, lots of room in the back and a great selection of food but I think if I were to come back, it would be for the day drinking aspect alone.",

Try the Sunday brunch and have the pico chicken, the wings are good, most sandwiches are great, and it's just a very comfortable place. Out back is a great deck to chill or inside with lots of TV's for sporting events.  Montford is the hottest spot in the city these days and Brazwell's started the boom. And I saw an average review of a burger but apparently the writer didn't have the southern burger with cole slaw and chili. YUMMY.  I hope to go back this weekend.",

My friends mentioned that the Montford area was filling up because Uptown (as people in Charlotte call downtown) was becoming less attractive. So, apparently it's always like that. Service wasn't necessarily slow, but we were in a booth and no one served us. If you don't mind a crowd and mostly standing, not a bad place - particularly if you live in the South Park area.",

Which was odd as when I walked through the restaurant to go to the restroom I saw a couple groups of employees lounging and hanging out. The slow service was fine as I like to take my time during brunch. The brunch drink specials are out of this world. $4 Bloody Mary bar and $2 mimosas, I ordered one of each and both were great. My husband ordered the french toast with grits and I ordered the salmon BLT. My sandwich was great, the salmon was well cooked and I loved the arugula and aioli, it was very tasty. Hub's grits were out of this world, maybe the best I've ever had. The other couple we were with got an omelette and the chicken and waffles and they both loved the food. 5 stars on the food and 3 for the staff.

Started with the fried pickles (a totally foreign and new concept to me) and have to say pleasantly surprised. Continued with the buffalo chicken salad, which was very tasty and filling and of course topped it off with a few beers. The waitress (Gina) was outstanding - efficient, ultra-friendly, sociable and overall pleasant to be around. No request was too hard or not done in a timely manner. A real asset to your establishment. Sat on the big patio out back which really topped the day off. I will definitely be back next time I am in the US.",

The location is small and like the previous reviews have mentioned parking is a bit of a challenge.  You order wings by the pound which I think is awesome! I was pleased that they had such a good variety of flavors outside of just the usual Hot and Mild. They also had  Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, Spicy Teriyaki, Buffalo Cajun Ranch and Sriracha just to name a few. I went with the Lemon Pepper and Spicy Teriyaki. My favorite hands down were the Lemon Pepper. They were hot and juicy with just the right amount of flavor and kick.   My main issue is the service. It's spotty at best. We spent a good amount of time waiting for our waitress or looking for her (which I hate). But the wings will bring me back. Let's just hope I can score a good parking space and booth!",

While we both tried to apologize to the bouncer, he would not even listen to us and was actually pretty aggressive. He made sure to tell us that he didn't care about the girl and how she was acting, but more upset about his shoe.

I was not impressed with my steak. It was explained to be marinated with Teriyaki with island spices and flavors with pineapples. The Steak had no flavor. Maybe they tried to cook it in Teriyaki last minute and the sauce just burned off? I don't know, but it was definitely not marinated as described. I definitely would not return for the food.",

We were pretty low maintenance on this visit but our service was still really good.  My boyfriend had the cheeseburger & fries, which he said was delicious. I didn't try his burger but the fries were veryyy good. I ordered the chicken nachos on this particular visit. The nachos were overall, meh. I love a good plate of nachos so I was somewhat disappointed. They do have a great drink selection, which was a plus. If half stars were an option I would say overall 3.5 rating. We'll definitely go back, but I'll be trying something else for my meal.",

We came early and got seats on a bench in the middle of the inside bar. After watching the fight for an hour, a bouncer came up to us and said we had to leave our seat because \"a customer\" wanted our seat - no contact from the actual \"customer\". Upon 5 of us leaving, one girl took our spot at a large bench. We had been buying drinks throughout the entire time we were there. All the bartenders were very kind and wish we could've enjoyed ourselves, but the treatment by the bouncer was never apologetic or curious. Because of this we will not be returning.",

Enjoy it now before the humidity and summer days come racing in.  Currently, I eat here with a group regularly for Friday lunch.  My go to are the salads.  My go to's are the sweet salmon or the house with salmon, chicken or shrimp.  I have had salmon that had a stronger than usual fishy taste and smell so I'm hesitant to order the salmon at times. This past Friday I decided to change it up and order the buffalo chicken grilled salad, not fried. It was okay.  The chicken tenders were small and have no flavor.  Hardly enough sauce to taste the buffalo.  I had forgotten from a previous order not to do this again but to order a grilled chicken salad and order a side of buffalo and blue cheese to toss in.",

They have Indoor seating and  a great deck for outdoor seating with sunny and shady spots, lots of tvs and a plethora of adult beverages, so the perfect spot to watch games on tv. Very casual atmosphere.    Food is good and they have lunch specials.    Visited on a Friday around lunch time and ordered the fish and chips that was the daily special. Oh my heavens - the fish was lightly battered but absolutely  so fresh and delicious, who would've thought!!?! The fish was served with fries that were seasoned - very worth the $10.  On this day, I also tried their Sundrop Slushie!  Careful, goes down easy but packs a mean yet sweet punch!  On Saturdays and Sundays, they have $4 Bloody Mary Bar which is phenomenal. They have so many BM mixes, lots of toppings for your MB and the largest olives known to human kind.  You wont go wrong by stopping in and having one or three.  If MB aren't your thing, try their $2 Mimosas on Saturdays. You'll thank me later!",

However every visit seems to prove Brazwells is taking turns for the worst. I, and my family, have been faithful clients of Brazwells for years. However that is changing. This recent birthday experience was borderline unacceptable and unforgiving. The food didn't arrive in a timely manner, was not up to standard, and communication was poor between the kitchen and our server. Instead of the manager approaching the table we had to request his presence. He came over and expressed his apologies for a poor experience and offered to comp a dessert for myself and my sister.  This still didn't address the food issue. After stating he would take care of the food items of our very large order we received our checks at full price. After expressing further discontent he assisted the waitress with barely comping one of the meals. In retrospect I should've adhered to initial red flags and exited to spend my birthday at an establishment that would've truly made a below subpar birthday experience a decent one. Brazwells I'm not sure what has caused the decline in service and food quality, but I hope something is done soon to retain clients and bring in additional business. This was our last visit.   p.s. we miss Hannah and Blake. They truly know how important client experience is",

But if someone says where should we watch the game/day drink/Sunday funday, this always comes up in the mix. I end up here the most during football season. My best friend is an Iowa fan, so when his game and my Huskers don't conflict, I end up here at the Hawkeye bar on Saturdays.   The menu pretty much covers it all. Different blue plate specials each week day. They do a special pork tenderloin type sandwich for Iowa game days. It's what I always get. Other than that, I don't really have a go to here. Zucchini fries, burgers, wings- it's all perfectly fine.   There are different specials every day. Of note: Tuesdays- Kids Eat Free & Half priced Wine Night (I mean, you'll probably need a glass or four to deal with the kids, right? JK, JK), Wednesdays- $3.50 drafts, Saturdays and Sundays- $2 Mimosas and $4 Bloody Mary Bar.  Fantastic patio and TVs galore. It's Montford, so you can expect it to get pretty fratty. Parking is not great in this entire area. Do yourself a favor and call an Uber if you're partaking in adult bevvies.",

I do like the deck on a nice spring or summer night . The wings aren't bad. I also enjoy their beer/drink specials. It's just a typical bar/restaurant. Nothing to separate from others along that strip .",

    "text": "This bar/restaurant is located on popular Montford Drive so be aware that it can be crowded and parking can be difficult.  It's not far if you have to park across the street but some people have a problem with that so be aware.  I've been here a few times and sat inside and outside.  When the weather is nice, the back patio is the way to go.  The service has been hit or miss for me.  The food is really nothing special but it's not bad.  They have daily drink specials and a Bloody Mary bar on the weekends where you build your own drink. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful even though our waitress did disappear for a long time this past weekend.  I've tried something different every time I've been here and nothing has really been that wonderful.  We had the chicken pita with pub chips and the salmon BLT with pub chips.  Chicken pita was dry and the chicken seemed chewy/over cooked.  The pub chips with some ranch dressing were delicious.  Be advised that they charge you for a side of ranch dressing.  I'm never a fan of places that do that. It should at least be disclosed to you. The salmon BLT came out with out the bacon but they quickly corrected it when it was brought to their attention.  I would say it's a decent place but it's not special. I will continue to come here to try food and to enjoy the beautiful patio. They have large TVs on the patio so it would be a great place to catch a game.",

    "text": "Great food, terrible service.  This review is based on just one dinner at Brazwells. Some friends and I decided to eat dinner here for a girl's night because on Tuesday wine is 1/2 price. We each ordered a glass of wine and an entree, planning to stay for a while as the weather on the back patio was so nice. After a very lackluster service experience including being served the wrong wine and one entree arriving 10/15 minutes before the others, our waitress told us that her shift was over so she was going to close our tabs and bring us boxes. We were still eating and drinking so to be cut off before we were finished was unexpected. If she had not closed our tabs we definitely would have ordered more drinks and stayed for longer. Other tables experienced similar issues, so it was not just one waitress.  It's sad because the food was very very good, especially the mac and cheese. I would like to come back but I think I would need to know that the wait staff had been better trained in customer service.",

Brazwells offers both liquor and food, as well as an indoor and outdoor venue.  The menu is pretty much your standard bar fare, but can do the trick in a pinch.  The scene on Friday and Saturday nights is pretty packed.  In fact, if you're a lady, be prepared to wait for one of two (female, unisex) individual bathrooms.  I like that Brazwells offers a DJ on the weekends but the dancing space is quite limited - you need to be prepared to bring your own party but it is manageable!  What I love about Brazwells is the outside patio.  It has it's own bar, and plenty of flat screen TV's.  Also, in the colder weather there are fire pits that help to warm you up!  The biggest downside is the wait time for drinks on the weekends.  I've had to wait as long as 25 minutes to be served - standing right at the bar.  Again, it is a give and take - good crowd but not always the most efficient bar.    I'll be back in the future, and I suggest you try it out for yourself.  Most people love it or hate it - roll the dice :)",

Recently, my friends and I came by for a beer, but decided to eat in. We let the hostess know this and she brought us menus. Then, we waited.  Over the course of 35 minutes, we tried flagging down a few waitresses, but they were ignoring us. One waitress in particular was spending all her time and one table. That table sat down when we did and had their appetizers and full meals out before we ever even got a drink order in!  I finally went to the bar and asked if we could possibly get a server. The girl who eventually helped us did a decent job, but we waited so long to order that only one of my friends ate. Everyone was pissed, and I really can't blame them. Overall, we were there almost an hour and a half just to get our meals and everything. I like the casual vibe and it is a decent spot to watch a game, but it's definitely not the place for decent customer service. My advice? Just come for the beer and order at the bar.",

Atmosphere - Good mix of 20, 30, and 40 somethings, a college kid to business man crowd, clean, restaurant-y inside, nice deck area in back, pub-ish  Drinks - I never really noticed that they mix a decent drink here (in the main bar area) until recently someone with me mentioned that the Capt & Cokes here are mixed well.  The quality of their mixologist became more noticeable after we left and went to Angry Ale's and then Andrew Blairs (well, Adrew's more for pricing)  You would think that as the night progressed it would become less noticeable as to how the drinks tasted, which means the other places must serve some really lousy drinks.     Price - Cap & Coke...tall...not a double...$6  Overall - I always have a good time here and the atmosphere, while crowded is good.

The lady at the table next to me, who screamed profanity every time a play happened during the game, leads me to believe this may not be the place to bring children. However, I was impressed with all their screens and would consider going back during college football season to enjoy a game there. I'd also like to try hanging out on their patio during the warmer months.  Our server was pretty good, despite being very busy.  Wine prices seemed high for this type of pub, so I opted for a sangria, since I wasn't in the mood for a beer.  The chicken dumpling soup was good, and my fellow diner raved it reminded him of his grandmother's soup.  However, I was extremely disappointed in my pear salad. The menu said it was served on mixed greens, but all I got was some tasteless iceberg lettuce. I should have spoken up at the time and questioned my order, but I didn't, so in Brazwell's defense, I didn't give them the opportunity to correct this blatant error.  I will give them another shot, and look forward to providing an updated review at that time.",

We were quickly being seated at the patio, however the table was not stable, we then later moved to the table behind us, and the second table was worse than the first, it was so wobble that I constantly worried drinks would tip over and spill anytime.  We ended up moving back to the first table. It took a while for the food to come out, none of our two burger orders were made the way we desired, both came out well done when we asked otherwise.  Wings were good, plus half off special. It seems to be a decent sport bar overall, but I don't know if I would go back again, especially when I think about the unstable patio tables.  It takes away somewhat a relaxing Sunday brunch experience since you always have to focus on the drinks of the table.",

Here's my advice when you go to Brazwells: lower your expectations for timeliness and service.  Our waitress was nice, but beyond ditzy and I could see other waitresses just standing around, which led me to believe this is the norm.  That being said, the food is not bad.  Go outside, order a beer, watch the game on one of their many TV's and just enjoy the evening.",

    "text": "Pretty decent place and a staple when you're going for drinks on Montford.  Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Lots of young 20-something's hanging out there on a Wednesday night so if you are in hat age bracket, the. You should have a good time.  Looked like there were a lot of Affliction-wearing dudes but not sure. Definitely gave that vibe.   Awkward because birthday girl wanted Stella and they had it but had to go to the bar to get it, wouldn't serve it up which is meh.  If you want Stella and want to sit outside, I wouldnt come here.  Other than that, solid.  dmo out",

We really enjoyed ourselves (maybe too much on a work night) and our food/drinks as well.   I ordered the salmon salad.. the salmon was ok - the salad stupid.. I still haven't figured out why Charlotte can't get on the wagon and serve better salads... NO ICEBERG please... but no worries.. I ate it. My bloody mary was de-lish as well.   Oh and the band was really good!",

Once the DJ starts cranking at night, you can't hear the person next you inside. It is a great spot if you can get a table on the deck but other than it being on Montford, there is nothing really appealing about this place over any other bar outside of Uptown. I've never had the food, drink prices seem to be average. Can sometimes make for some interesting people watching with the various crowds it attracts.",

Probably due to it being Saint Patrick's Day weekend.  We both ordered the Pimento Cheese Burger; it was phenomenal.  The wait staff was super friendly and attentive.  I will definitely be returning on the future.  I do wish the bathrooms were a bit bigger though... Parking is a hassle.  The parking lot is super small and you can't park across the street at the bowling alley or your car will get towed.   That's why only four stars.",

    "text": "My friend recommended me this place and we went after dinner for a few drinks. It was a Tuesday night so it was slow, low key and actually perfect for us.  We sat down and ordered some beers and our server was nice but every time she came to the table to ask if we were ok it seemed she changed her mood... happy, mad, happy, sad.... it was weird but she was easy to find most of the time to get more drinks.  A few of our other friends stopped by and we had a good time and ordered some shots. They were great and we got them right away. There's TVs everywhere and the atmosphere is really nice. I will say that I did not care for the fact that they have single stall bathrooms so when there's a crowd you'll have to wait forever for the bathroom.  Overall its a really cool place and I hear they have great specials.",

Seating area preferred: Outside front patio by the cool looking obelisk silver heater!  Overall feel: Love it! Good drinks, nice hang out place with friends, great music to listen to, I finally found a place that is close by, don't have to go to the Epicentre, and plays hip-hop. I miss dancing, and this place is a great place the get your groove on.  If I get tired of the place, or need a change of scenery, head over to Andrew Blair's for more dancing.. Or Angry Ales for more drinks and relax :)",

This bar was a great place to bring 10 heavily intoxicated girls - the weather was beautiful the back patio was awesome - and with the amount of men around drinks were plentiful.  I look forward to coming back at another time to really check this place out!",

A group of us guys went to enjoy a few drinks after dinner, and were pleasantly surprised at the chill atmosphere and wide menu of drinks!! Being a cocktail drinker and not so much of a beer person, I was skeptical at the quality of cocktail a man-bar may create.  However, when I ordered, the waitress said that my drink was REALLY good and her favorite but the bartenders hated making it because all the girls who came in ordered it. Haha.  I knew this was the drink for me after that remark!   And, it arrived in all it's Strawberry Sangria glory and was DELICIOUS!!   The boys with me enjoyed their brews and a great time was had by all. There were plenty of TVs to watch sporting events, if that was something we were interested in.  Great time, great bar, great night!",

    "text": "I go to Brazwells a lot on Montford, for lunch pick ups or after work happy hours but today experienced unusually poor service. I ordered food online, got there to pick it up and joined the 3 other people waiting at the bar for to go orders. The lady behind the bar, Tammy I believe her name is, is never friendly but this time came across more rude than normal. I usually don't mind when the bar is full, but since there were only 3 people sitting there, I'm not sure why it took her 3 or 4 minutes to even come over and acknowledge I was there, just have a snotty reply when I told her I was there to pick up food. The to go is usually slow, so I know to wait before I drive over, but today I waiting 35 minutes for wings. That SO slow, especially considering there were only 2 table inside. There was no addressing the fact I'd be standing there for 15 minutes when she finally did come out, just a \"here\" and a bag shoved at me. A \"sorry it took so long\" with a smile wouldn't have killed her. On top of that, I watched the other staff sitting in the back eating food in the doorway for 5 minutes before mine was brought out. If I hadn't have paid online already, I would have walked out. I worked in food service for 5 years and am well aware that some kitchens are slower than others, however, with no one in there today there was really no excuse. The customer service from this bartender every time I'm there is always poor and has really made me dread having to go in and pick up orders even though I love Brazwells food! Thinking lunches there might be over for me, you can't be slow AND rude!",

    "text": "Me and my friend came here on st. Patrick's day. I have serious issues with the waiter service at this place. We ordered drinks and two appetizers. Mozzarella sticks and nachos, both were $8.99. There were only like 6 mozzarella sticks for my order but the nachos came in a huge plate? I feel like I was getting a pretty good deal for the nachos(but after all they are just chips and some shredded cheese and diced tomato, shouldn't cost much to begin with). While on the other hand, I was paying like $1.50 per moz stick, wow those are some expensive cheese sucks I tell you. Neither of the appetizers were super wow amazing, I can give my moz sticks a 4/5 and the nachos 3.5/5.  It was a Saturday so we both also ordered mimosas, mimosas are one of the Saturday special drinks, only $2 each!! That's pretty darn cheap, though it comes in a tiny tiny narrow champagne glass. The mimosas are ok, 3.5/5.  My biggest problem is that when we walked in to the bar, no one approached us, we had to fetch for our own table, eventually we couldn't find a table so we sat at the bar. When we wanted to order our drinks, there were waiters standing around and we definitely looked like we were ready to order but no one approached is still. By then I was pretty pissed and was ready to leave but I decided to give it one last try, I approached one of the girls and finally placed my order. When I asked to have a cup of water on top of my order she looked irritated and went back scooped the ice and just handed me my water. When we were day to pay no one approached us still, the whole time we were just left there, I almost did not leave a tip.",

I have not eaten a meal here.  I have had the pimento cheese dip (which was an awful consistency-- think not-all-the-way melted Velveeta), I have seen the wings, and had a various assortment of fried bar food.  It was all fine.  My friends thought the burger was delicious-- both were suffering from the liquor flu so I am not trusting their judgment 100%.  The service here has never been good.    The location works.  The back patio is fun (has its own bar) and the Bloody Mary bar is fun.  This is a place to go and drink, not go to eat.  And don't be surprised if you have to get your own drink from the bar because your server is no where to be found.  Maybe I am just disgruntled.  I miss the Press box being here...",
