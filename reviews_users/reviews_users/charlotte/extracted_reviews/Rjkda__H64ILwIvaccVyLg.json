    "text": "This is high quality fast food pizza, but I'm judging it against all pizza.  Were I comparing it to pie five, uncle maddios, or one of the other build your own pizza chains, it would rate above those others. They have a pretty good crust that does have decent flavor, but they lose me with the pam spray coated dough press.  I hate the uniform fast food look of every crust and I don't like the use of the aerosol cooking spray with my crust.  Toppings seem to be high quality for the price point.  A 7$ pizza will always be a 7$ pizza.  You simply can't provide the best ingredients without charging more.  That said, the toppings are high quality for the segment. If you're searching for exceptional pizza I would tell you to go elsewhere.  If you're looking for a nice thin crust to load on some proteins, veggies, or whatever your preference, this is a great spot. Not a culinary destination, but a cool place to grab a bite and have the flexibility to get creative without breaking the bank.",

    "text": "In case you haven't heard, Blaze is the Chipotle of pizza! They have a ton of fresh toppings that include a wide assortment of veggies and protein. They even have different base sauces to choose from. If you customize your pizza, you can add whatever toppings you like at no extra charge. Undecisive much? Choose a pizza off of their menu and customize it. I had a half and half pizza. One half was red vine with pepperoni and the other half was BBQ chicken and I added bacon. Trust me, it took me 20 mins to make up my mind, there are soooooo many options. Both were delicious. They have an assortment of drinks and local beers. But you must try the blood orange lemonade. It's sweet, tart and tasty. If you're not in the mood for pizza (seriously? then why are you here) they have an assortment of packaged fresh made salads. The caprese salad with balsamic glaze is yummy. Don't forget dessert. That's right, they have a delicious smore pie that they warm up for you near the fire. It's warm, ooey gooey goodness!",

Seen a long line as a drove by blaze about 9:40pm, so decided to gas up and swing back around and grab a pizza before heading home hoping the line would die down...lucky enough to find street parking, I walked to the door and encountered a customer looking dejected as two employees turned him around and i ask him what they say? \"they are closing taking no more orders\". I looked at my watch and was dismayed when it read 9:50pm, Then I glanced at the door which read closes at 10pm.... conflicted and a bit and confused I walked away with the dejected customer saying he drove far to arrive here on time. I then double down on my experienced to go get gas and hurry back over. He flashed a discount card and said the \"gatekeepers\" gave it to him and said they would maybe give me one.....I peered over one more time and seen a customer ordering and seen the \"gatekeepers\" waiting on the next unsuspecting customer so they can rattle off their canned response and I said nah not worth it! Talk about a bad impression, I don't know who decision it was to turn customers away during business hours but it was so ridiculous!  No problem Blaze,  I went up to South Boulevard to one of your competitors where the door was certainly open and no one guarding it.",

I keep telling myself to try something different, but I keep reverting back to my favorite which consists of: garlic pesto sauce with a drizzle of spicy red pepper sauce, feta and mozzarella cheese, spinach, chicken, turkey meatballs, zucchini, roasted red peppers and finished with a pesto drizzle! This is hands down the best pizza in the city! I also love how they are extremely cautious with someone that has a gluten free allergy! Blaze's staff goes to great lengths to ensure that they protect the surface and utensils used to create a gluten free pizza and I've never seen any other establishment handle a gluten free allergy to this magnitude. Oh, and get the blood orange punch to drink, its amazing! Check out Blaze, you'll thank me later!",

The topping choice is extensive and laid out for all to see.  I've been at least four times before writing this review and I don't see a reason to stop.

I love how everyone called you by name and we're just so happy to help you make the tough calls on what to add to your pizza. That really is the hardest part, too many wonderful choices, but I love you can do a half and halt so you can try more options. Salty, but that is too be expected with pizza. Although I will admit if you are salt sensitive like I am it is a little overwhelming, meaning you really taste the salt every bite you take.  I love pizza and this is probably not the best pizza I have every had (that was in in Italy), but for the concept and cost it really is a special treat.   A great lunch time spot.

They do not serve alcohol yet, at least when I was there three weeks ago, but on their menu it states that they will serve beer and wine.  Once they do that, I will increase my visits because a great pizza and a glass of wine will be wonderful.

Cons: its only open until 10 weekday and 11 on weekends.",

    "text": "Here is the restaurant equation folks:  Chipotle concept + Awesome thin crusted Pizza = the beautiful creation of this Blaze joint that destroys Pizza Hut and Dominos combined.  I wish I knew about this place months ago in the heart of Southend. On a pizza craving whim, I decided to give this place a shot on a Sunday night.  First of all, the size of their pies were perfect (about 13-14 inches) with gluten-free dough as one of the options; solid selections in sauces, cheeses, and protein.   What ultimately did it for me?!.... their BYO pizzas were ALL UNDER $8. Oh and did I mention it was also unlimited toppings? Yeah..I don't know what deal is going trump that.  After building the meanest pie stacking all sorts of toppings on there, it took nearly 5 mins to cook. And most importantly, the freshness and quality was there after inhaling the first 5 bites.  Y'all need to go!",

    "text": "Knowing I was going here for dinner got me through the day. Several of these build your own pizza places are popping up but this spot is my fav. My go to is basically the meat lovers with typical meats and It comes with red onions. Maybe add bacon or garlic from time to time but I don't get too crazy with the toppings. The key is get the spicy marinara!! Yes, get the spicy marinara and you will be thanking me.  I crave this magical sauce. My recent visit I even got extra sauce :)  For a drink I go with the famous blood orange lemonade. Worth getting that for sure. They also have beers if you want a beer with your pie. I will opt for that sometimes but hard not to get the lemonade.The staff and management are super friendly.  These pizzas cook fast so between the efficient staff and oven they can move the line quickly. Added benefit was yesterday they ran a special for 4 bucks a pie after 4. I got there early enough to avoid the line but saw it getting long as we left. 4 bucks is amazing but even at the reg 7sh dollars still very much worth it. It is large enough for leftovers but I typically crush the whole thing there. Remember I love the spicy marinara.  Will be coming back here again and again.",

    "text": "I've had a chance to experience Blaze multiple times within the past few weeks and I'm ready to give Blaze my official stamp of approval.  Here's everything you need to know BLAZE...  Food/Pizza:  Let's start with their claim to fame - the pizza!!  As opposed to one of the Signature Pizza options, I usually go with the \"Build Your Own\".  They offer a few different crust options - a traditional/thin-crust, a high rise and gluten-free options - I prefer the thin crust.  I like the \"Build Your Own\" option because you can add unlimited toppings for no extra charge, so why not take advantage!?!  I like to go with the mozzarella (extra mozz), feta, and parmesan cheeses, that's right 3 different cheeses! I then add pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, and whatever else I'm in the mood for on that particular day.  After they throw your pie into one of their blazing hot ovens for 90 seconds, be sure to take advantage of the finishing sauces they offer - I love a drizzle of olive oil to finish my pizza off juuust right!  The pizza tastes amazing friends.  All the toppings taste and look fresh.  Due to the flexibility and  bounty of options available, if you're unhappy with your pie, I'm sorry, but its your own fault.  Don't want to \"Build Your Own\"?  No worries, they have plenty of signature pizzas to choose from as well. My personal favorite is the \"White Top\" (add chicken).  I can't speak to the salads or deserts but I'd like to recommend this berry-lemonade they have.  As far as beverages go, its an awesome, summery, non-soda option.    Service:  The service has always been super chill every time I've been to Blaze.  Employees are mostly younger, early 20s, friendly, and willing to strike-up a convo without hesitation.    Parking:  Parking can sometimes be an issue at this Blaze location - depends what time you are going.  There's no parking lot exclusively for Blaze's patrons, however there is plenty of street parking available - get in where you fit in.    Ambiance/Interior:  My first time here I was struck by how open and expansive the interior is.  There's plenty of high-top tables near the ordering area to sit at.  There's also another section down a few steps with a bunch of tables.  I will say, sometimes it feels like a heard of buffalo just ran through the joint - the tables need to be cleaned, the floors swept, etc.  Although, that could simply be a product of the high number of patrons that come thru Blaze daily.     No complaints here.  This was an easy 5-stars for me.    BLAZE ON!",

    "text": "An awesome addition to the city in an already booming part of south end. While the general concept for these quick and casual custom pizza places are the same, Blaze executes the concept very well. The gist is you make your own pizza (or choose from some pre-selected starters), pick out as many toppings as you want (all included - no price changes if you pick 2 or 20), and then they cook it in front of you. The result is a custom made pie with whatever you want - no more group arguments about toppings - all for under $10. A pretty good deal if you ask me. In addition, all the toppings I've tried have been fresh and tasty. The biggest issue is deciding under the gun what topping you want on your pizza. Pro tip - don't overload it. It's an easy thing to do, but just do what I do and come back for another pizza at a later date.",

They also offered to put basil and salt on my pie. The extra mozzarella I asked for was free. Next time I'm going to go with the limitless toppings. Saw other people's pies with some crazy toppings, and they looked delicious. The toppings all looked fresh and stations looked clean. Excited to explore the menu.",

Blaze IMO is the \"welcome to Moe's\" shtick on pizza making.  Far from NY or Chicago.  I, too, ordered the Green Stripe, but alas they were outta pesto and delivered it sans arugula.  While the pizza is tasty, I doubt I'll return.  Maybe if they were just around the corner.  Just not a fan.",

Since then they've closed and I was really happy to find a Blaze open up in Charlotte. We walked in last week for a build your own pizza lunch, there were no lines, which was awesome. Its been a while since I've eaten here so I wanted to sample a simple pie with red sauce for $5 (pretty good deal considering the size of the pizza) and a white top add onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes. Note: you can kill your pizza with all these awesome cheeses! I LOVE that their toppings are chopped up into little pieces! This was an issue at the Irvine, CA location, they wouldn't finely chop up their toppings making for one soggy pie, especially if you were going veggie with zucchini. This was about $8. Thin crust is awesome so I love these pies. They also don't smother you with toppings so you can really enjoy the combination of sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies you selected. I would avoid the sea salt if you are even the slightest sensitive to salt, it gets really salty!   There is plenty of seating and the staff is very friendly. Definitely coming back for more, oh I'm going to get so fat.",

    "text": "I couldn't wait to return to Blaze after a Yelp event... it was actually only 2 days later. I'd been craving more every day. So why wait? I'm still not sure where to park for this place. I know there is curb parking, but other than that, not being familiar with the area, I was lost. I think there was a deck? But it seemed to be for residents? I don't know, I ended up luckily grabbing a spot on the curb. Walking up it is a vivacious scene. You see people eating at the outside tables, enjoying themselves. It makes you intrigued and excited to walk in.  I walked in and the line was pretty short. The employee  greeted me with a big smile as soon as I walked up which made me more excited... and then she just kind of looked at me. Had I not came before for the Yelp event, I wouldn't know what to do. They were so lively at the event and explained every step of the process. But not this time. I also noted this with a couple that was new to the place and came in behind me. So my first note is to offer more direction.  I mean this isn't your typical pizza place afterall. I order 2 pizzas and stepped down the line, really taking the time this round to build the exact pizzas I wanted. But it became pretty frustrating around the time to add my meats. I had 2 people asking me at the same time what I wanted on each pizza, literally. It was like they were getting impatient that I couldn't answer both at the same time! I eventually had to ask for 1 to wait while I worked the 1st pizza. Especially after I asked for more pepperoni and she literally picked up one pepperoni and place it on the pizza. Really lady? Don't Chipotle me! She eventually neglected my pizza and went on to the next customer. Which was actually for the better.  As I paid for my pizzas I grabbed 2 of the smores. They asked me if I wanted them warmed, but being that I had about an hour drive home, I decided to wait on that. She forgot to give me my credit in the app, then after the fact wrote down my name and said she'd post it in the back? Not sure how that benefits me in the App. As I waited for my pizzas I witnessed with the employees a couple attitudes and some yelling by the cutting station. As a customer, It was really awkward. I was thinking, do they know that we can see them??? lol. It was like getting a quick taste of Hell's kitchen. But as promised, a few minutes and they were calling my name for my pizza and I scurried out of there!  Literally the only thing that made me happy about this visit was that I knew the pizzas were going to be delicious and of course they did not disappoint. Every singling topping is so fresh and flavorful. None of that processed, pre-packaged mess. As you bite into the pizza it's not some big greasy mess in your mouth, you can distinguish between each topping as you chew. I got the Regular crust, but i'd be interested to see how the thin crust looks, as the regular seems really thin itself. But it bakes nice and crisp around the edges. I love it! And my favorite part is there sauce is the 1st i've had that does not give me heartburn!! I also never thought i'd be eating a pizza with Ricotta on it, but it's now my new favorite thing on my pizza. When I got home, I warmed one of my smores, not thinking too much about it. I mean it's just a smore right? Yes it is, only the most delicious smore ever! The cookie was so tasty and with the marshmallow and that nice milk chocolate, and i'm not even the biggest fan of chocolate, I generally don't like it. But I ate the other smore right away. As I hibernated that weekend, I ate those pizzas all weekend. Didn't share a single slice! They warmed in the microwave nicely, still maintaining the quality. Blaze is my new favorite Pizza spot!... Sorry True!",

Yes going up from 2 to 4 honest stars now (Hey shut up! its not because I got passes for free pizza from Justin, after my first not-so-good experience). First of all, shout out to Justin from Blaze's team.  He reached out to me via Yelp messenger and offered me couple pizza passes as an apology for me not having a great first experience at Blaze's (in my initial review I would have complained of burnt pizza).  I mean, I was taken aback with the gesture.  Who would go to that extent to please a customer, especially when its already a 4star reviewed?  I am super impressed with the customer service and Justin's gesture.  Blaze is for sure in the pizza business for a long haul. Thank you for being kind and doing what is right to please your customers.   Our second time - now we know how it works, it was easier than the first to choose and ask what we needed and our pizza's came out with nice and crispy edge with delicious toppings and we honestly enjoyed the taste more this time.  Like I always believe its just not the food but the whole package that makes a food place a great success and heck Blaze is definitely in the right path. Cheers Blaze team!",

The blood orange lemonade is the bomb.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and the line was really long and moving slow. As in took 27 minutes from start to finish. So not really the quick experience we anticipated.   I know now that I would not wait again, but would definitely be back for another pizza.",

    "text": "I waited until after their free pizza day to try this place for two reasons. First, I expected better quality when they were not slammed. Second, less than $8 for all the toppings I wanted was worth it not to stand in that humongous line (I actually drove by on the way to somewhere else and at an off-peak time, the line was still waaaay down the block). Oh yeah, that's right...sub-$8 for all the topping you want! They have a menu with a few signature pizzas. But don't let that limit your creativity. Because for the exact same price they list all of their sauces and toppings. And they have a lot of options including goat cheese, grilled chicken and a lot I wouldn't eat but you might. Basically, you'll be able to make a solid pizza no matter your preferences.  One thing that sets this place apart from another chain with a similar model is they put the pizzas in a fire oven. Now, this is good and bad. I personally like crust that is cooked this way but there is risk, especially when they have a bunch of pizzas in there, and that is the form of burnt edges. I'd say that 50% of the edges on my pizza were blackened and thus uneatable.    I also tried their signature s'more pie since I was giving this place an honest shot. It was actually really good. Not something I'd probably order for myself again because I didn't \"need\" it, but I'd recommend giving it taste.    Overall, worth a return visit and much better quality for a $1-2 more than the big chains.",

    "text": "I was fortunate enough to visit Blaze for the first time during a Yelp Elite event... They really rolled out the red carpet for us and left me totally impressed with their food, service and overall ambiance and culture.   The food and drink are top notch. I crafted my own pizza with half spicy and half traditional red sauce. I liked the spicy best, for what it's worth. Also had my crust \"painted\" with the pesto sauce. Yummy! Toppings included ovalino and shredded mozzarella, Italian sausage, roasted garlic and arugula. I love arugula on pizzas and I especially love restaurants that offer arugula on their pizzas! (Annnnd, restaurants that know arugula goes on at the very end, after it comes out of the oven.) The pizza was delicious, if I say so myself. And, I'm the one that created it, so I think I get to say so, thankyouverymuch. Beer selection was spot on with a wide variety of local brews from Birdsong, OMB, NoDa, Triple C, Highland, etc.   We also had the antipasto salad (I didn't try it but the Boyfriend seemed to enjoy it), s'more cookie (just a tad on the dry side -- would have liked more chocolate and marshmallow) and blood orange lemonade (um, so yum!!).   Their price point on pizza is almost unbelievable. $8 for unlimited toppings?? I'm not sure how they do it but I sure am happy that they do! Seriously folks, this is cheaper than any other fast casual concept and the food is SO much better.   Every single staff member we encountered -- from the greeter (Shorty) who explained the process to us to all the topping putter on-ers to the cashier that closed us out -- was so friendly and accommodating. I felt like a part of the family and so enjoyed learning more about the company and their business philosophy. Recyclables! \"Clean\" ingredients! Philanthropic and community minded! What a cool spot.   Can't wait to give lots and lots of business to this amazing little pizza place on the corner of Camden!",

    "text": "So I heard so many great things about this restaurant so I had to come check it out. It was a long line and plenty of ppl seated outside(which is always a good sign). Only waited a few minutes to put in my order. so I ordered a high rise create your own. Had to wait a few more minutes for that to be made since it's more layers. I got sauce, mozzarella, chicken, feta, garlic, artichoke hearts and spinach. It looked great.   Paid for me and my brother. He got the bbq chicken with pineapples and it also looked great. So he got his pizza after awhile. They were busy so I knew it would be a wait to make our pizzas. My brother got his pizza and I waited for while and figured I had a longer wait since I ordered a high rise.   Anyway I go to the counter and inquire about my pizza. He looked around and said I know what happened to your pizza. He spoke with a guy who was picking things off of MY pizza. I said how did he get my pizza is his name Dee. The guy behind the counter told the other worker I said her name. I said excuse me are you saying it's my fault my pizza was given to someone else?! He didn't pay me any attention after that.   I just asked for a refund the cashier acted as if I was wrong for asking for a refund. She said can we make you another one I'm sorry. I said no I'll just get a refund. She called her manager. We waited for him to come and he asked can we make you another one? By now I'm hungry and over it. I said ok whatever. I had to wait for him to make another high rise. By now my brother is almost done eating.   He makes my pizza and I was so irritated I forgot to get chicken on it since I paid for that. I didn't realize it until it was too late. It was my fault  so I didn't ask for it to be added. He told the guy making the pizza to make it on the fly. I waited a few more minutes.   By now we have to leave because we were going to the movies. I ask for it to go. I get in the car to take a bite and it was chewy and the dough wasn't all the way done. I was so pissed I threw it in the trash as soon as I got to the movies. I was so pissed off I could scream.   I was about to call and go off but I let it go. I woke up this morning and said I need to write a review. We wasted our time and money going there. My brother said his pizza was just ok and probably won't be back. On the bright side the only reason I'm giving them a 2 is because the location is awesome and the lemonade was good. I should have got a refill before I left since I waited so long for subpar/undercooked pizza.   Oh well...I end up having movie pizza. Talk about disappointed. Wish they gave me a refund like I asked for to begin with but I went along with the manager when he came and said lets remake it for you.",

I've been here a couple of times already and  everyone is really friendly as you move down the line to create your choice of pizza.   The size of the personal pizza yields about 6 slices, so if you're really hungry then you can eat the whole thing. But if you're like me (sometimes I eat cute for lunch and pig out later) then you can have some now and have some later. Either way... It's good.   There's no charge for any extra toppings and it's cooked in 180 seconds... So you really can't go wrong here. The only downside is parking. During the lunch rush, street parking can be a bit tricky. But it's not enough to keep me from showing up with a smile and an empty stomach.",

They told me, \"if you order one of the pizzas, you get to put whatever toppings you want on it!\"  After going in, I found out that you can order a \"Make your Own\" pizza or a \"Signature\" pizza. Both were great options for me, but I went with the Veg out pizza. They ask for your name, so be ready to give it.   I took the zucchini off, added extra mushrooms, garlic, red and green peppers, extra red sauce dollops, and oregano. I should've added some extra mozzarella.  A few moments later, my pizza was ready. At the end when they call you to pick it up, they will ask what topping sauces or pieces you would like. I got the arugula and the pesto sauce.  Overall, it was a great choice and a great atmosphere. I can't wait to go back for some amazing reasonably priced pizza.",

I got the build your own pizza: Spicy red sauce, shredded mozzarella, grilled chicken, turkey meatballs, artichokes, banana peppers, olives, oregano, roasted garlic, and jalapenos with a side of ranch. It was cooked to perfection. The crust was light and crispy. I also put red pepper flakes and Parmesan on top, which was on the table. Oh it was so good! They have a ton of toppings so you could come here multiple times and never order the same thing. But the real winner was the turkey meatballs. I talked about how awesome they were on the pizza for about 10 minutes till my husband shut me up. Ugh so good!   The blood orange lemonade was also equally as awesome, plus they had small salads available. The goat cheese and beet salad sounded amazing. You can easily order a side salad and split the pizza with another person (that's what the people behind us did), but I was to greedy and got my own- plus had leftovers. They also have an outdoor area so feel free to bring the pups.   Overall great time at Blaze and I can't wait to me go back!  5 stars!!",

    "text": "WORST. STAFF. EVER. I've owned a restaurant for several years, so I tried my best not to leave a horrible review because I understand the frustration from an owner's perspective.  However, after several trips to this location, I couldn't possibly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Ever. I've never been in the place where the workers move at anything more than a hybrid sloth/turtle speed. I work in the area, so I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and try again and again. Every time, I've sworn to myself not to return, but the quality and price of the pizza kept me coming back.  Until now. I finally cracked. With one person in front of me, it literally took 12 minutes for them to make my simple pie and put it in the oven. I was borderline twitching. Luckily there's another franchise closer to where I live or I'd be done with this chain for life.  If you own or manage this franchise, for the love of god PLEASE explain the concept of urgency to your workers. I'm sorry to have to leave this review, but banking on the possibility of good service has left me high and dry (and hungry) too many times.",

If this is your time let them know that and have one of their staff walk you through the processes because you don't want to miss out on anything! Especially that you can get as many toppings as you want for 8 bucks! They do have a cheaper one topping pizza I am guessing is for kids because what adult would not want to load up their pizza with their exciting line up of cheeses, meats and other toppings. If you are feeling overwhelmed they have some popular pizzas that you can choose from. One of the most impressive things is how fast they are even on a busy Friday night we only waited about 15 minutes from building our pizzas to them being baked and ready to take out the door. I do wish they had some more crust options they do have gf, but a nice wheat or other flavors would be good.",

My wife actually said \"what the hell is that?\" It was like a cracker with some sauce and a tablespoon of cheese on it. She was not happy at al with the size, look or taste of her gluten free pizza. I had the meat lovers and the taste was really good, but it was basically an appetizer. For the tots of $21 we both left hungry and I actually stopped on the way home to get a chicken sandwich . So I'm not really sure what all the buZz about over at blaze pizza",

I also love their fountain drinks, teas, and lemonades. They have a great raspberry drink!",

Location: 5/5 Smack dab in South End and conveniently next to the light rail. Street parking isn't too bad after 5pm but no worries if you can't find a spot, Blaze validates for the parking deck.  Atmosphere / Ambiance: 4/5 Super casual. My normal dining attire here is a tank and shorts. I've never actually eaten here but they wouldn't mind if you dined-in sans sleeves. There's some tables outside also in case you want to catch some sun rays or people watch. You can steer at everybody being fit while you stuff your face with carbs. That's some good living.  Cleanliness: 5/5 Pretty clean, bright and modern.  Service: 5/5 As you make your way down the assembly line, everybody is nice, friendly and more importantly they don't skim on your toppings.   Food: 5/5 Really good and filling. Unless you suck at picking toppings. If you fail at this life skill, your build-it-yourself pizza will be awful and there's no one to blame but yourself. I'd suggest going with one of the options on the board then.",

Our first few visits were amazing; great helpers, great pizzas, clean place. Unfortunately, our last handful of visits have gotten worse each time. We are now met with an extremely rude staff, especially on Sundays, who don't even make eye contact with you. They're constantly joking around, yelling to each other, and acting as if they don't care about the customer. Perhaps they don't, but they should at least pretend to. The pizza is sometimes slightly burnt on the bottom which seems to happen more when the store is busier. This is easy to overlook, however, the staff's attitude is not so easy to ignore. We were so unhappy with our recent visits that we emailed Blaze headquarters and CCed this store on the email. HQ answered ... and offered us free pizza (after us stating in the email that we will never be visiting again - unless the issues are fixed. Offering free pizza doesn't fix the issue). The store never answered.   It's sad to see great places fall, especially pizza places ... of all things (who doesn't LOVE pizza?!). In good conscience, we can no longer recommend this place to anyone. Our last visit was the final straw and we haven't been back since, even despite living 2 minutes walking distance away.",

The concept is really cool since you get to build your own pizza and watch them create it before popping it in the fire oven. I was really annoyed that they didn't offer a number to sit on your table for pizza delivery if you were dining in.  I had to stand around for almost 15 minutes while our pizzas cooked and my other guests were seated at a table.  This would have greatly improved my experience.    The pizzas we ordered were good, but burnt on the bottom.  So much so that one of them tasted like just burnt crust over the other toppings.  Wish they had more pizza suggestions on their menu.  I like that they offer links like goat cheese - but I wasn't sure what toppings would pair well with that.    I will try this place again, but maybe take my pizza to go.",

As a resident of the apartment complex that houses the location, it goes without saying that I have been a regular customer since day 1. Even though the quality of the food has dropped slightly as of late, it is the quality of the service that is most disappointing!! The last few times I have visited this location I have left questioning whether I would return. On each of these occasions, the employees seemed to be preoccupied with goofing off rather than assisting the customers.  When I visited the other night, the employees seemed completely uninterested in proving semi-decent service most less what I would consider to be acceptable. One guy kept wondering around the dining room aimlessly while another stood behind the counter with his pants barely pulled up above his knees which I find extremely disrespectful and not acceptable for such an establishment. Everyone else stood around joking and barely paying attention to the customers that were needing assistance.   I think management should take more initiative in making sure this place gets back to the same level as where it started.",

It was pretty easy to navigate and the staff were very helpful.  I got a caprese salad (with an incredible balsamic vinaigrette) and he got the red vine pizza.  They were both amazing.    The decor is very industrial and interesting.  We'll definitely go back.",

My friend and I ordered online for two build-your-own pizza - I like how easy the whole process was. When I get there, the pizza doughs were ready to bake to ensure the freshness (which I like). I only waited for 3-4 mins and the final products were worth the wait. Both of them were thin, crusty and perfectly seasoned. Definitely coming back!",

    "text": "I've been to Blaze twice now and have really enjoyed both experiences. The line can be daunting when you first walk in, but it moves pretty quickly! The first time I went here the first employee in the assembly line was very friendly and explained to us how everything worked quickly as to not hold up the line behind us. (I'm sure this happens often as the concept is still somewhat new for a pizza restaurant).   After adding all of our toppings and paying at the register we sat down in the dining area. This area is the only problem I have with Blaze, they have some gorgeous giant windows to look out of, but zero shades. The sun is blinding during lunch time hours, we actually moved to the back tables to get out of the sun.  It even gets in the eyes of the employees when they ask for your toppings selections, they have to squint at you, poor guys.   After hearing our name called we retrieved our pizza and started munching. It was delicious! The second time I went here was with my brother and his vegan girlfriend, she was so excited to see that they have vegan cheese and loads of veggie options to choose from. Definitely something for everyone!",

    "text": "Stopped in one night before walking over to Sycamore along the rail trail. They had handed out free coupons a few weeks prior to promote their opening, so I had to try it out.   I understood the concept of the \"mod\" pizza after frequenting Zablong which is close to my office in uptown. I built my own pizza with no trouble, then waited less than 5 minutes. I noticed immediately that the prices for a standard, no-frills pizza are lower than Zablong. I had a coupon for a free pizza, but I believe it would've only been $6.99.   The pizza was definitely smaller, but the thin crust was kind of charred. Definitely a serving size for only one person. I think you can pay more for a thicker crust. It was nothing special, only a place to fix a quick pizza craving. I choose Zablong over Blaze.",

    "text": "I was visiting Charlotte from out of town and was looking forward to trying this new concept for pizza and was HIGHLY disappointed; not so much in the food, but in the level of service and basic menu knowledge of the staff there. The pizza was decent, though a little burned I have to say, but overall I was impressed with the variety of sauces and toppings they had to offer. The staff seems to be completely clueless in regards to what they are actually serving on the menu or how to put anything together; for instance the gentleman waiting on me stared at me blankly when I asked for Italian dressing on my salad and was expecting me to know which dressing bottle that was behind the counter in order to instruct him. Needless to say he couldn't tell the difference between a light colored Italian dressing and a dark Balsamic glaze; seems like that should be pretty simple to determine. We also had to track down someone to wipe off a dirty table for us that had clearly been empty for quite some time. There appeared to be no clear supervision for the employees there at the time (on a busy Friday night mind you) and they were all clearly in need of it. I feel like this could be a great restaurant, as the overall concept is great, however the staff is in need of some major training on the menu, customer service, and some overall guidance.",

    "text": "I tried it on its opening day. Verdict: Although the staff is incredibly attentive and friendly, the pizza is ok.   You start off by choosing between sauces: Classic red, white, and spicy red, for example. Then they send your pizza to the toppings person (Chipoltle-style) and there is no limit to how many toppings you want, and let me tell ya, the variety is impressive. Goat cheese, garlic cloves, banana peppers, arugula, caramelized onions, feta cheese, to name a few. Then they send it to the oven.   3 minutes. Done.   The pizza is thin and is cut into 6 small slices. It was good, but nothing extraordinary in taste.  The best thing about Blaze was the staff. They come to your table and offer to bring drink refills and to-go boxes to you.",

The first three goals went according to plan; the pizza however did not go over so well. Ordered two pizzas via the app after having such an amazing experience at the location in University figured I should try out the one near the house. Walked in as they were firing the pizza (no worries I wanted it fresh) the pizza came out black not just a little black a lot black. The spinach was charred to the point where I would have been eating nothing but carbon. In contrast the red onion on the pizza was literally raw.   Instantly asked them to refire them at first the guy was trying to cut off the black bits - that is fine if it just a bit I get fire will do that to pizza, but it was the whole thing. They did refire the pizza, but I had to wait an additional 10 minutes only to get pizza that was ultimately undercooked. Got home and had doughy pizza that was completely inedible. Not my idea of a good date night or good pizza. Extremely disappointed considering the pizza I had at the University location was literally all I could talk about for almost two weeks.   Not sure I will go back after tonights fiasco.",

I was third in line and it took 22 minutes from walking in to them actually finishing putting the toppings on my pizza. 3  The employees are young (high school age) which accounts for some of this but it was the most dysfunctional operation I have seen. One manager on site and she could not handle getting everyone in line. No body wanted to work apparently because at one point, we all stood for 5 minutes while not a single pizza was prepared. Everyone seemed to think someone else would just do the job for them. It was more so just kids joking around and not working while the manager was in the back.   While waiting, they started one pizza for the two of us then chose to line up 7 online orders before our second pizza. So being the second pizza on the order, I had to wait 20 minutes after the first was already done before mine was completed. So my girlfriend had to sit at a table watching her pizza get cold while I waited on mine.   They need to work on training employees so they know what to do without being guided every step of the way.",

Choose your crust and mosey down the line to have it your way, right away!  No matter if you want 2 toppings, or 10, just pile it on.  Completely customizable!  Watch them pop it in the oven and it's out in no time at all!    Crust options include regular (which is fairly thin), deep dish, and gluten free.  From there, pick your sauce.  Some options here are white, traditional, and spicy.  The spicy is my favorite!  After that you can just start shouting out topping options.  You name it, they have it; traditional to eclectic, it's all there.  Needless to say, I got a little carried away.  The size of your pie is perfect.  Some would say it's ideal for one, others would agree that it's easily sharable for two.  Want dessert?  Grab a s'more pie!  They will heat it up for you too!  A little messy, and not nearly as good as the pizza, but there as an option for you nonetheless.    I will say I'm going to have to go back to try this blood orange lemonade that everyone seems to be raving about.  I'm not really sure how I missed that!  Yet, at the same time, I'm not concerned since there's no doubt I will be back!",

However, throw all your preconceived notions of \"fast food\" out the window. It's fresh, healthy and custom made in front of you.  The simple /plain cheese pizza is only $5!! For another couple of dollars you can create your own with unlimited toppings. The topping and sauce selections go on and on. I tend to get carried away and have a mile high pizza. If that's too overwhelming, they have suggested recipes/combos on the menu board.  Fresh salads - highly addictive Blood Orange Lemonade - S'mores pie (get it toasted!).  Hopefully soon they'll have beer! Don't be scared of the line - it will move quickly. You also see the owner jumping and helping out and even cleaning tables! That says a lot about the quality of service and work ethic here! Really convenient Southend location!!",

I returned with my family shortly thereafter to enjoy this new found awesomeness. The restaurant is nestled on the corner of Camden across the tracks. There is nice outdoor seating and a intimate indoor seating section with sorta like communal tables. The staff here is so nice they are very welcoming upon entering they greet you with a smile and someone is ready immediately to assist you in placing your order. The fact that you can get unlimited items on your pizza for one price is so AWESOME and the fact that the ingredients are so fresh and flavorful are icing on the PIE :-)  My last stop on the pizza train to completion is the SMORE, you must ask them to warm your smore which is done by placing it on the ledge in front of the brick oven Mmm Mmmm Good.  Overall as I said The Best Pizza I've had since living in NC.. My only caveat is the cleanliness of the dining area. It's NEVER clean EVER I always have to grab napkins and clean the seats and the table before we sit.   Go Get Blazed & if dining in be ready to wipe your seat and table.",

All you need to know is that this pizza is fresh, delicious, and you have to have it!!  I love pizza so it is rare for me to find a pizza place I don't like. Here are the pro's of this store:   1. It is fast and fresh 2. You can choose AS MANY TOPPINGS AS YOU WANT!! All for the same low price I might add.  3. Pizza's cooked in a fire pizza oven (I'm sure there is a more technical name for it) and are always delicious.   I personally love white sauce pizza and it is delicious here. I usually just go for mozzarella and some feta, but the gorgonzola it tasty too. You can never go wrong with extra meet and veggies. I have friends that get the BBQ chicken pizza and say it's worth it! Now I know having the option to put as many toppings as you would like on your pizza is tempting, but you have to fight the urge the first (or second or third) time you go. Just go multiple times and try new creations and combos! Too many toppings = messy falling apart pizza. Also, the blood orange lemonade is great. I usually get water everywhere I go (to be cheap) but it is worth it to splurge and get the lemonade. I have even combined some of the lemonades!  The place can get busy! We went the other day and the line was wrapped all the way down to the drink machine. Still, the wait was maybe 10 minutes, so still faster than a sit down restaurant. The workers are always friendly! Just do yourself a favor and go here for lunch or dinner today. You will be satisfied for sure!",

    "text": "This is the second of these instant pizza places that I've been to lately and it's a great concept. It's like the Subway/Chipotle model of made-to-order pizza. It's quick, it's custom and it's tasty.  They have a handful of \"set\" combinations, but those are nothing more than hints. Meat lovers, veggie lovers, that sort of thing. But they're all completely open to customizing as you and your pizza make your way down the toppings line. And yes, everything's a set price.  I opted to start with their \"White Pizza\" adding chicken and extra garlic. Once topped, it went into the oven and then maybe five minutes later, it was out of the oven. A thin and crispy crust with all the toppings nicely melted. Very delicious, if I may say so myself.  Inside and outside seating.",

    "text": "I guess my expectations were a bit much.  I missed an event here a week ago, but that wasn't going to stop me.  I love a good pizza and I will drive  half an hour to get it.    Blaze has some great menu items. And, I love the simple menu pricing.  Very similar to Zablong in Uptown.    I actually had a hard time choosing between the signature pizzas. I love BBQ, so it was a tough selecting to order the Green Stripe.  Yum.  So, I love to order ahead and Blaze has an online ordering system. It's very easy to use and I was able to chose my pickup time.  I ordered at 535 and set my pickup time for 550.  After circling a bit I finally found a parking stall.  By the time I walked in it was just after 550.  I went to pickup my order at the call in order area expecting to be able to grab and go.  Unfortunately the pizza wasn't ready, so we had to wait...  ....and wait.  Several patrons were waiting, but the joint was by no means crowded: Maybe 10 people there total. 15-minutes later they called a carry out ready for \"Chuck.\"  We stood and watched for about 5-minutes.  Chuck never appeared.  The folks behind the counter picked up the pizza and then called out Brad. That's me! Wow. Big difference between Chuck and Brad.  Ended up wasting 20-minutes with 5-minutes reserved for my pizza to get cold.    If I hadn't ordered online expecting to be ahead of the game and then waiting for a pizza that should have been ready, followed by more wasted time and a drive home I'd be a little less preturbed.    The pizza itself isn't what we ordered.  I'm guessing because they just threw what they had at us.  If it's called a green stripe and no arugula is on it. No pesto drizzle either...not sure what to say.  Poor product.  I just prefer a little more organization and attention to details.   I'll reconsider the next time I decide to stop in for a beer at Lenny Boy.  Right now, Blaze isn't serving the brew but apparently it's part of their future.",

I arrived for lunch right after 11:30 - you have to get there early! This place fills up fast! But don't worry they move the line fast!   So first things first...prepare to be overwhelmed...it's all the toppings you want...and the cheese you want...for the same price.    Shut the front door!   The best part - service here is amazing! Everyone was so accommodating! They really made sure that my pizza was made exactly like I want and I left a happy customer.   I decided to try the White Top which comes with their version of the white cream sauce, mozzarella, bacon, chopped garlic, oregano and then it's sprinkled with arugula. I added ricotta cheese, mushrooms and Italian sausage I mean...why not? Its unlimited toppings!!!   Once my masterpiece was created they popped it in the oven 180 seconds and I was out the door. But not without stopping for a quick snap of my delicious pie!   The first bite was everything I expected and more! The best part was the crust, it was so light and crispy. I enjoyed every single bite!   There's so much more I want to try here - they have a spicy red sauce and tons of fresh toppings calling my name!",

    "text": "You had me at arugula!  I waited until the opening week \"jitters\" had hopefully been worked out and after they recovered from their \"free pizza\" day since I heard the line was out the door.  But I am pleasantly surprised by the new kid on the block in Southend.  I vaguely remember seeing a Blaze in Chicago, but I've never had the pleasure of trying it out until last evening.  I live within walking distance, so equal parts awesome and dangerous here.  It was a beautiful 70 deg evening so a lot of folks had parked themselves on the tables outside.  When we walked in, there was no line - the staff gave us the run down through the menu and their offerings.  I went straight up White Top (no deviations) and was super super happy.  Pretty much this close to buying a smore cookie, but I think I indulged my pizza craving enough for the evening and will definitely try one next time since they heat them up for you!  Hashani took the words out of my mouth:  \"The Chipotle of Pizza\"!!  Except they have way more toppings and choices to mix and match to your pizza heart's desire!  And you don't have to keep track of your bowl traveling down the line since there is a paper with your name on it and the friendly folks working the line definitely wear your name out, just like an old friend would.  The space itself is underneath the new Camden Apartments and has a modern/industrial feel.  High ceilings and graphic art on the walls, yet still warm with wood tables and concrete floors.  The dining area is separate by a staircase and a wheelchair accessible elevator and there is a station for extra cheese, oregano, and red pepper flakes.  I really like the tables outside since you get to people watch and see the traffic from East/West Blvd.  My apologies to the runners running by... I would hate to run by this place and watch people stuff their faces with pizza as I am a heated/sweaty mess.  Overall, pizza is the star here!  And super affordable.  I love the crust...I'm deeming it a \"Goldilocks crust\"... not too thick, not too thin.... just right.  Can't wait to be back and custom order the krap out of more pizzas.....",

I believe I waited about 25 minutes or so, which I thought was incredibly fast given that there was a line out the door and around the corner.   The Staff at Blaze is incredibly nice. They speak to you by name, which just goes a long way for me. While your pizza passes down the line, you are greeted by friendly and courteous staff.   The pizza line has so many different toppings that are unlimited....the word unlimited is such a problem in my life because that then means that I just want everything! On this occasion, I harnessed in my inner glutton and went with the Art Lovers pizza and added chicken and bacon. I loved that ricotta and the red sauce was added in chunks. At first I was apprehensive about not having the red sauce spread like a typical pizza. However, I think having the chunks throughout made the pizza! The pizza was delish and I loved the crunchiness of the crust (plus, it cooked in 3 minutes!!).   I love the concept behind this place and think it is an excellent addition to the South End area!",

I witnessed one staff member being asked to perform a task in a different way, and she thanked her manager for telling her the correct way to do the task.    On my third visit last night, I was nearly moved to tears by the kindness of the staff.  I had a friends kids after working on an art project with them at a local gallery three blocks away.  I wanted to treat them to a special build your own pizza.   So, we walked.  I had taken my computer bag into the gallery and just assumed my wallet would be in there.  When I got to the check-out, it was not there.  I know I was blazing red.  I was trying to decide if I would leave the kids there, run back and get it.  Make them walk with me before eating.  See if they would let us bring back the money after the dinner.  Before I could process it all, the manager at the cash register had taken care of it.    Needless to say, I am spreading the word on this restaurant.  Please visit and enjoy!",

Despite being very busy we were sitting and eating our hot pizzas within about 6-8 mins from walking in the door. I ordered a BYO with pepperoni, bacon, sausage, roasted garlic, sauteed onions with a spicy red sauce. My wife ordered the green stripe add olives. Mine was awesome. For a fresh pizza made in less 10 mins, with as many toppings as I wanted for $8. Service was solid, albeit a little chaotic, but they got the job done. Space is decent size, wouldn't want to go there with more than 4 people. I have tried similar restaurants like MOD pizza. Blaze has the edge in my opinion.",

Choosing the traditional crust I got the classic red lightly spread on my pie, i always find that they put too much sauce for my liking. Then I went with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, italian sausage, and basil. I also had them sprinkle some oregano on top before cooking. The pizza takes only about 5 mins to cook and it comes out with the delectable crispy and burnt crust. I always ask for the fresh pesto on top because it ties the pizza together perfectly. The pizza is big enough to split into 2-3 meals so either bring your friends or clear out space in your fridge because you'll definitely want to take home the leftovers. If you like pizza, who doesn't like pizza, and want a great fast meal Blaze Pizza is the place for you.",

Their special touch would have to be their house lemonade and Agua Fresca selections. As someone who almost always only orders water when I dine, I must say the prickly pear water and blood orange lemonade were worth the add on.  The staff is colorful, present, thoughtful, and they seem happy to be there. I enjoyed my pizza (which was large enough to make two meals) and plan to return in the future.  Decore is simple, nothing unique or ambient. And when it's busy the mixture of orders being called, patrons, and music can make things noisy. There is fairly open street parking with meters right by the restaurant as well as a free two hour parking option in a nearby deck.  Why not 5 stars? It's certainly good, just don't know if it's the best pizza joint in town.",

And because I looked upset with how she was being treated he sarcastically and with an Attitude said \" oh you want me to touch your pizza\" between him and another young man continued to make smart remarks and making comments about me to one another out loud. Such as  \"Yo chill she bout to slap you\"   I will never come to this blaze again. They should take hiring staff a bit more serious.

The lady topping our pizza was not consistent with topping our meats and garlic (way too much) 2. The pizza cooked too fast and the toppings were not cooked or even hot, the dough/crust was perfect though.  Good Points: We did have good customer crevice at the front of the line taking our order!  We just left so if you review those working at the time this is posted, he was great! The place is comfortable and clean!",

It's amazing! and they're super generous. They'll keep asking, is that enough? And they'll keep giving you more. Between that philosophy and their price, it's seriously the best pizza place ever! However, when you aren't there (i.e. when you order online), you get screwed SO HARD on toppings. For example tonight I ordered 8 toppings and I probably have barely 2 topping's worth in my pizza. It's really tragic! And it's definitely a trend: I've ordered in store and online several times and there's a huge difference between the two experiences.  They are honestly so generous when you order in the store, but it's super disappointing if you're in a hurry and can't stand in the line, or if you are heading there and just want to put your order in early. It deters me from ordering from this place :/ I hope that's a helpful review! The pizza is great otherwise!! GF crust is on point too!!",

(In my Shirley Ceasar voice)  I already had the app on my phone, so I was prepared to obtain my free drink and record my entry of purchase.  Somehow, it didn't scan but I didn't notice until after I left. I called and talked to the manager Jimmy, and I felt almost scolded that I didn't ask for a receipt because that's how it works to get it fixed. I didn't know that. I'm a new customer remember??? He told me to come by tomorrow to see the GM.   I did go back to the restaurant the next day to see the GM and I told him (GM WILKINSON) about what happened and he told me to contact customer service. He was very standoffish and didn't really want to help me, even rushed me to tell him why I was there and assumed I just wanted free food. He just referred me to contact customer service to fix any issues that I had.  That didn't make me feel good as being a new customer, and I'm not aware of how things happen at the restaurant. I did not scan my free drink and my purchase at the same time. I did that separately, and the cashier did say that it took when I asked her. I also could not put the pie code I was given in on the app because it would not allow me to (to use on a future visit). I mentioned that to the general manager as well, and he still directed me to let customer service handle it.   I was not impressed with his customer service skills even though I know it was a busy time, but that's when the manager Jimmy told me to come and speak with the GM because he would be available.  I'm still waiting to hear back from customer service.   I may go back again because the food was good.",

It's basically a \"build-your-own\" pizza spot, but not like your regular chain locations. They have every topping imaginable, from your choice of sauces (I loved the white cream sauce today) to turkey meatballs, vegan cheese, arugula (not getting that at a chain pizza place!) and even finishes like balsamic glaze and olive oil. If you aren't creative, no worries. They have \"signature pies\" to choose from, too... like the \"meat eater\", hubby's choice, and \"veg out\".   The establishment was clean and staff members were all super friendly. I love being greeted by my name and they make sure to do so.   Definitely worth checking out. Just hoping they add a location closer to home; I don't want to have to come just on workdays!",

I highly recommend the high-rise crust, even though it's an add on - totally worth it.  I am on the smaller side, but one of these pizzas is certainly 2 meals.  The staff is full of fun personality, if you talk to them.  Great addition to South End.",

While they do have a variety of toppings, which is fun, I just didn't feel the overall quality was the best. Also the crust and sauce are just not good. I wanted my pizza to be cooked longer. Both times I've been, I didn't feel like the cheese had been given enough time to melt! Blaze is adequate...and what's that old saying? The pizza you're eating is always better than the pizza you're not eating?",

I know olive oil was the one for my pizza but I had never been here before & like it when my server can take the time out & explain how things work.

Tell em what dough you want (they have gluten free dough for an up-charge), tell them what sauce you want (I like the white sauce), tell them what toppings you would like (I like the getting a ton of different meats with feta and mozzarella cheese. Don't forget the bacon and roasted garlic), they cook it and you roll out. Easy, simple, quick, and delicious.   My Advice: Check your pizza when they hand it to you to make sure it is yours. Sounds stupid but when they pull pizza's from the oven sometimes they take the little metal number off the pizza which tells them who's pizza is who's then hand the wrong pizzas to people. Created a lot of confusion and mistaken pizzas being handed out when I was there. I will chalk that up to a one time mistake when they had just opened.",

We usually get Zablong which is delicious, but heard good things about Blaze and thought since we we close by, let's go.   Great decision... The pizza was delicious, we both got the thin crust option. I got various topping with meat, veggies, olive oil and the cream daisy, which I highly recommend.   It was made fresh in front of us and everyone was friendly, only took about 3 or 4 minutes to bake and we were eating! I got a blood orange soda there that was the best soda I have ever had. Get it if you can.   I think we might have a new pizza place! Hope you enjoy.",

You can add as many toppings as you want and it's still the same price, about $8. They make the dough in house every day and also have a gluten free crust. I always get the spicy sauce, a mix of cheeses, turkey meatballs, and then decide the other toppings based on my mood that day. I recommend not going way overboard and adding too many. I feel like it affects the baking and quality of the pizza if you do too much. There's 40 toppings to choose from, so choose wisely. I also recommend eating your pizza there right after it comes out of the oven (don't take it to go). It only takes a few minutes to bake. For me, I usually can make two meals out of a pizza. Or, I could just as easily crush the entire thing in one sitting.   Parking note: Blaze offers free two hour parking at the Camden Gallery garage. Or you can find a street spot, it's free on the weekends and after 6pm on weekdays.  Random notes: the workers always have smiles on their faces. I've met the owner here, both him and his wife are both super nice. The outside tables are great for people watching. Get a s'more pie for dessert and make sure to get it toasted in the oven.

After going back in forth with me being combative he finally gave me the discount...really ridiculous. Second, they lost my pizza or gave it to someone else so I had to go back thru the line.

Once my pizza arrived, it was barely \"warm,\" no longer hot and didn't even look fresh, like it does when picked up or ordered in store. It was also overlooked, which can't be seen in the photo (the pizza was very hard to chew). I asked for extra pepperoni and did not get that all.  On a scale of 0-10, my pizza was about a 4.5.

    "text": "For the love of Pizza, why did it take me so long to check this place out?! Off the southend light rail and in a hopping area, this place is always busy (with good reason come to find out). Yes they are a chain and sometimes chain restaurants can get it all wrong with something that is hard to mess up but this is not the case. I tried something that was already on the menu, the Meat Eater, added my personal touches and it was delicious! The pie crust was crispy, flavor of the sauce was good, the veggies I added were great. They had vegan friendly options my friend enjoyed which is great. They have all the appropriate separate tools to prepare and the line associates knew the correct way to prepare her pizza.   I will say, my all-time favorite place Zablongs has way more toppings but its Uptown and I was in Southend. I wanted to try something new and I am glad I did. I will also add, the customer service could have been better. They were all friendly but you can completely tell that some work harder than others. Seems like the staff is very young but that can only be excused to an extent. I would give it 3 1/2 stars but its \"whole\" rating here so ill give it a three, not exactly a full 4 stars.",

Getting home the pizza was just ok because the bottom of the pizza was a little burnt.    The salad was really good and fresh.  It had strawberries blueberries and cheese.

I think after they touch onions, peppers, mushrooms, etc. they should change to a new pair of gloves before beginning the next pizza in the line. People could be allergic to something they just finished touching. Also, the same with the pizza cutter. Several times I've had small pieces of ingredients on my pizza just from the pizza cutter. But now I always ask them to change gloves.   btw , this was a my birthday pizza w/ my candles.",

The salads that you offer, are beside the employee that take your order. Fully contaminated. Ovens can be cleaner as   Updated  I wanted to give another chance.  Today  an employee called EZY explained me a few things I've asked. Got best pizza white top and more toppings. It was a great experience and the pizza delicious. The employees were better today.

The pizza is good and I can get something different every time I go. Your choice of thin crust or a thicker crust for a small fee.   Ask for the course salt and pepper at the end of the line.   One of my favorites is the traditional red sauce on thin crust with mozzarella, gorgonzola, tomato, spinach, red onion, roasted garlic.  Get the blood orange lemonade; that is some good stuff! Pairs perfectly with the pizza",

I like that you can customize your sauce, because oddly enough, I don't care for red sauce. So if you're like me you can opt for the alfredo sauce or the pesto base. You can also add seasoning and a sauce drizzle to your pizza after it exits the oven. I always get a buffalo and ranch drizzle on my pizza and then I don't have to dip it. I like that you can see the pizzas cook and the house made drinks and teas are really wonderful. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because I wish they had appetizers. I love breadsticks or having something to go with my pizza so hopefully soon they'll add more items to the menu. Great place though!",

Such a great way to get a thin crust personal pizza. Such a great toppings bar too. I did try their salads too. Good stuff. If you have kids, they'll love it. If you guy for lunch, expect it to be busy.",

Although the original dough is amazing, I decided to try the gluten free for the first time...and let me tell you...Wow!  Doesn't taste like I'm missing out on anything!  I also love the variety of sauce options and the fact that they even have Daiya vegan cheese!  Everything is so fresh here and you can really tell that they use quality ingredients!  I also love that the manager is always on the floor.  (I think his name is Lontz?) He has been able to recommend some of my favorite pizzas & I never leave feeling like my business isn't appreciated!  This place is going to do well in the Queen City!",

    "text": "Blaze pizza, or Blase as we like to affectionately call it, offers a unique casual experience with particularly good service and tasty custom made to order food.   For $7.85 they offer a whole variety of ingredients to make your own pizza with sauce, meats, vegetables, and other toppings. Within a few minutes, your custom pizza is made hot n fresh out the kitchen mama rollin that dough got hungry men in there wishin.  This is all nice and dandy to have hot n ready custom pizza with good ingredients, but what really makes this place stand out is the service. Everyone on the line was very friendly and welcoming, addressing you by your name and making your personal pizza feel exactly that, personal. Even the guy in the dining room was very helpful handing us napkins and cheese and clearing out plates before we even asked. In fact, their surprisingly excellent service brought up this good 4 star experience up to a 5. We were so pleasantly surprised that if you told me before I came that I would give Blaze a 5 star review, I wouldn't believe you. Even as I write this review it feels weird to give this style of restaurant a perfect review, but I still struggle to find fault at a price of $7.85.  This casual dining experience felt more than casual, and for the price and level of service, how can I complain?",

When my wife and I first walked in we were looking at the menu, and one of the workers called us up to the counter and helped us by explaining how their menu worked and gave us suggestions. He was incredibly friendly and pleasant. I built my own pizza, which is $7.85 and you can get whatever toppings you want at no extra charge. After you build your pizza, you pay while they cook it, which is not a long process at all. My pizza was very good in my opinion, but I made a mistake by ordering the spicy sauce on my pizza. I enjoy heat, and it was tasty, but after two slices it was painful to eat. Other than that, my experience was very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "While stuffing my face with a sandwich from CM in my car outside of First Wind before I went in for the Yelp Fit Club event there, a gentlemen from Blaze came up and knocked on my window (eek) asked me if I liked pizza (Duh.) and informed me of their opening and a free pizza promotion they had going on Friday. Who can say no to free pizza?! Even when you do have a mouth full of sandwich...  So Friday rolls around and I make my way over, wait in the line to get in the door (but it did move pretty fast) and approached the counter to build my own FREE pizza. Being the food jerk that I am, not being able to settle on just one thing, I made my pizza a half n half. No problem they said. Half classic sauce, ovalini mozzarella, ricotta, mushrooms, zucchini, roasted garlic, cherry tomatoes with a sprinkle of sea salt, the other half pesto sauce, mozzarella, feta, grilled chicken, bacon, red onion and spinach. Once outta the oven, all topped with arugula. In a mere 3 minutes they call your name hand you your pie...time to enjoy.   So, how was it you might be wondering. As long as you aren't expecting NY or Chicago level greatness here you will be delighted for sure. The array of toppings could make endless wonderful combinations. The crust was better tasting than I expected, crisp and chewy with great flavor. Out of the two halfs I chose, the chicken bacon one was the winner. The fast cooking time didn't seem to give the ovalini mozzarella enough time to melt all the way nor enough time to fully cook the mushrooms ( I'm not a lover of raw mushrooms). Also that side came out a bit wet...perhaps water from the zucchini. Trial and error. Don't get me wrong though, still delicious and the sea salt sprinkle was the perfect touch. The other half was oh so good, modeled after a pizza I used to splurge on all the time when I used to live in raleigh. Getting it at Blaze proved way cheaper and dare I say, even more delicious.  The size was great. I was full after eating 4 of the 6 slices, excited to have some for later. People that worked there were super nice and thanked me from coming by and trying them out. Wait, this seems all wrong...they are thanking me...for giving me a free pizza?! Seems a bit twisted.  Thank you fella on Wednesday that told me about the free pizza day. Thank you Blaze for the delicious free pizza and kind service. I will be back to experiment/ eat more in the future. FYI On any normal, non-free pizza day they are still a great deal. $7.85 for infinite toppings. $6.50 for one topping $5 for a plain cheese.",

This isn't the best pizza in the world but it's good for a quick personal size pie that you customize. Nice wood burning oven cooks the pizzas well.

The crust was simply too thin and like a cracker and there wasn't enough cheese on the pizza.   I also got the little s'more's dessert. They put 1 assembled s'more in a little bag and warm it at the edge of the pizza oven. That was good in theory, but like the pizza it was 'just ok'.   The staff were super nice.

It will be a hand tosses/ thick crusted pan pizza, typical pepperoni one slice type!  But recently I have to some lifestyle changes. More aware of my eating habits. Working out a lot and realizing it best to venture out when it comes to food, plus I can't eat the heavy carb, thick crust like I used too.  Blaze offered fresh ingredients and they \"WILL DO AS YOU SAY!\" I literally say it out loud to my pizza guy! How often you get to say, \" hey you do as I say when it's comes to how I like my pizza!\" Real loud!  I ordered the thin crust grilled chicken, simple classic red sauces, little cheese, grilled zucchini, spinach and pineapple! Then they cooked it a fire oven. Oh my goodness. Please see my video!  The crust are thin yet not soggy! Everything tasted soo light! I ate the whole thing. And don't forget to try the amores cookies. I could die for them. Soooo yummy.  Also I like how Blaze try their best to keep things local. Involve in the community and used recycle products. It's nice to know companies like this stand for something. Their mission are strong. I will be back and I don't think I will ever go back to thick crust pizzas again!",

    "text": "I was bummed that I missed their big event last week as I was out of town. We were in the area and very excited to try this place especially based on the rave reviews. We ordered ahead as it is better than waiting 20 to 30 minutes upon arrival for your order.  They had several tasty choices. We ordered the Green Stripe - Classic dough, shredded mozzarella, grilled chicken, garlic, roasted red peppers, arugula and pesto drizzle. I provide all the ingredients to establish a visual. Based on the name alone, one would expect to see some green on the pizza. More details in a bit. We ordered with a pickup time at 5:50 pm.   Upon arrival just past the pickup time, we were expecting to take and go. So unlike all other online ordering eateries, this one creates your pizza and waits for you to arrive to \"Fire it up\". This was mentioned on the email but we missed it. Ok, so we waited 15 minutes, when the male prepping the cooked pizzas called out \"Chuck\". No one appeared to pick up the order. And we waited, five minutes later, the same male, looked at the receipt again and then called \"Brad\". Yay, this was us, unfortunately it sat there and we still had a drive home. So much for a hot pizza. Ok, so I get maybe the reasoning behind not cooking the pizza until the customer arrives in order for the pizza to be hot upon pickup. Good concept, except in this instance it failed. The best system, in my opinion, is providing the customer a pickup time and it's up to the customer to arrive at this time for their food to be hot.    We got home, opened the box and I said, \"Where's the green?\" We ended up with all ingredients except the arugula and pest drizzle. So ironically, the term \"green\" refers to someone, or in this case restaurant, who is not yet experienced in a particular field or activity. Blaze has some kinks to work out for sure. If we are in the area again and we feel like a pizza, we may stop back in to give them another chance. For now, I prefer to wait a bit.",

This location seems to be up and coming and there was plenty of bustle going on.  Walked in and as I explained to my family, this is like a Subway for pizza.  Pick the base and walk down the line.  Everyone working there was super friendly and since it's new they took their time to explain everything to you.  I went with the white pizza, add grilled onions and roasted garlic.  Very tasty.  My oldest daughter has celiac and we were happy to know they offer a gluten free crust, they also take the care to wipe everything down when they press the dough which was much appreciated.  3 pizza's, 4 drinks were right at $36.00 (Gluten free adds a bit).  Great concept and good place for a quick bite.  I will say one negative, and the music inside was so darn loud!!  Maybe I'm just getting old :-)",

    "text": "I attended the Yelp Elite party at Blaze last night and I was thoroughly impressed. The owners are so enthusiastic and friendly and you can tell that they're treating their staff well because every staff member appeared happy and that translates into excellent service. Going to Blaze is a full experience...above and beyond just a restaurant. The staff were actually singing in unison at one point :)  The interior is comfortable, ultra clean, and the space is cleverly designed. Blaze has ample outdoor seating.  Now, about the pizza. I know I've mentioned this in other reviews, but again, I grew up in Chicagoland, I spent the last 9 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyrs.in&s=3e99916080cda660762c577ff164ab7266094e594df308d404c37d03e1f84a1c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yrs.in</a> Metro NYC, and I've eaten a lot of pizza in Italy. So, I'm a very picky pizza eater. Here's what Blaze has going for it: this is really good pizza dough and it's coal fired right there in front of you. This crust is actually the real deal. But possibly of greater importance is the fact that the staff is really looking out for you as you build your own pizza. We used to frequent 2 coal fired pizza places that were very highly regarded in the NYC area (Cassie's and Brooklyn's). Both good places, unless you ordered more than 2 toppings in which case the chefs allowed your pizza to become hopelessly soggy.  Here at Blaze there are 40 toppings (preservative free, by the way - no nitrites, etc!). Last night I must have ordered half of them on my pizza and the chefs had my back. They added the correct quantity in the correct order and there wasn't a bit of sogginess to the bottom layer of my pizza's crust!  Their toppings are of high quality and you pay the same price regardless of how many toppings you get...seriously! My pizza was under $8 and it included marinara, fresh mozzarella, ricotta, Parmesan, bacon, smoked ham, Italian sausage, black olives, mushrooms, bell pepper, spinach, artichoke hearts, purple onion, and tomatoes. Absolutely delicious.  Their packaging materials are minimalist and recyclable, these guys are far more eco friendly than most restaurants.   Their salads, s'mores cookies, and blood orange lemonade (all house made!) totally deserve honorable mention.   What is not to love about Blaze?! I am so impressed by this place and will most certainly be back :)",

They have everything from pesto base, turkey meatballs to feta cheese & artichokes, plus all your basics of course!   Pizzas (2 byo) took no more than 6 min to come out. Could've been less I wasn't counting but I was surprised at how quickly it came out! Crust is super thin and perfectly crispy.   Every single employee we interacted with was SO friendly and patient with us (my boyfriend is one of THOSE guys who got like everything on his pizza) and super informing about every question we asked! Wish I would've gotten the guy's name who helped us at the beginning of the line, he explained everything to us thoroughly and that definitely helped us a lot! We WILL be back!",
