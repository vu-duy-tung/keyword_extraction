We tried to let a manager know at the end but he was tied up in the kitchen (which is probably why the food was great too!) so we just wanted to put our compliments out there! If we go again we will definitely request DeAndre!",

My favorite thing about this restaurant are their honey butter croissants, they're SO good. Cheddar's is pretty average otherwise.",

The butter croissant that comes with the salads are really addicting... that could have been my lunch right there.  I ordered the \"new\" Sheppard's Pie which was pretty good.  Way too big for me to finish it.  At least I know what I\"m having for dinner tonight!   Can easily see this place from WT Harris, but hard to get back into the parking lot... not unusually bad, but cuts into the driving time if you are concerned about getting in and out - back to the office at a reasonable hour.",

Waitress was friendly and great personality.  She was prompt and attentive.   Menu was fairly varied, salads to sandwiches to steaks and ribs.   We tried potato skins (great combo of just right amount of potato, cheese, and bacon).   They were great.   Caesar salad was near perfect, just the right amount of very tasty dressing. Plus it came with a sweetened croissants that was delightful.   The main courses were Spaganzi (based cheese spaghetti) and a Monte Cristo sandwich.  The spaghetti was near perfect, fantastic tasters.  The Monte Cristo sandwich was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  My first one was 19 years ago, and no one else had ever been able to live up to that first sandwich, till today.  An absolutely perfect blend, cooked just right, just crunchy enough.    We can't imagine how this  meal could have been better, AND the price was reasonable.   It was quite a treat, the best experience I can remember in years.",

My one complaint was that we weren't presented with a drink menu. In fact, there was no alcohol mentioned on the menu at all, so I thought it was soda/tea only.

My 2 thumb-up reasons for coming here: selections and price.  I didn't say service, because I have had bad service here before.  Sometimes the wait is CRAZY!  But the waiter we had the most recent visit was great and we managed to beat that lunch crowd.  And I didn't say taste/quality, because after all this is a chain restaurant, you get what you can expect to get from any chain places.    I would say food is average.  I love the shrimp & chicken asian salad.  I also love the country fried steak (ohhhh I LOVE country fried anything...).  This past visit I got the fried shrimps and it was crispy and decent. And their honey croissant!    But seriously, where else you can go out and eat and be able to get an entree with 2 sides for under $10?!  And they are great portions.  So yes, for a quick causal bite, Cheddar's is a solid choice.",

    "text": "I am not a fan of most chain restaurants but Cheddar's is actually pretty good.  Cheddar's is family oriented and entertaining for children which is great because I know they can get antsy when kept waiting.  Cheddar's has a huge paddlewheel fan in the middle of the restaurant that looks like some kind of Orwellian/Da Vinci contraption and a massive saltwater aquarium that even I think is super cool to look at.  The service has been good in my experience and the food is decent too.  One thing that really stands out on the menue is the chicken strips/fingers.  I honestly think that Cheddar's may take the number one spot in all of Charlotte for this particular dish.  The meat is very tender and juicy.  You actually get whole chicken strips with crispy breading (not fraken chicken like a McNugget) .  The portion you get is just massive; and I am lucky if I can get a third of the way though most times.  A good tip:  If you take the chicken strips home because you can not eat them all, try broiling them when reheating.  Broiling will keep them crispy and heat them through all the way.  Just don't go too high on the temp. or take your eye off of them or they will burn.",

This was not on the menu when I went there (sometime last year), and is not on their online menu now.  Not sure what that means.  As far as the menu I am familiar with, a vegetarian can survive here, but its not pretty.  I had to order a plate of sides.  At some places this can be a blessing, but not here, as their sides are extremely bland, and are of the soggy-veggies/starchy sort.  Service was adequate, though not great.  Decor was typical of Applebee's, etc. type places.  Ultimately, not vegetarian friendly, but not a nightmare.",

While it was a bit of a drive for us, we enjoyed the place enough to make the extra travel time worth it. Fast forward to our visit there this past week though...I don't know what's happened but the place has really gone down hill. First off, the place was filthy. Stuff left on floors, food stuck on booth walls and the restroom, omg..the toilet seat had obvious prolonged accumulation of dried urine stuck on it..yuck. The hostess was pleasant and we were seated promptly but the waitress was cold, indifferent and slow. The food was mediocre at best...the soup was room temperature, the salmon was bland to the point of being almost tasteless and their famous croissants were overbaked on the outside and undercooked/doughy on the inside. The tea was weak with a hint of staleness. How sad that this place has been allowed to deteriorate to such a degree...we won't be returning.",

The broccoli and cheese casserole is a must have and they have a delicious side salad that comes with a honey croissant and it's TDF!  Another thing I like about cheddars is the price range. $7-$15. That's pretty affordable for the college scene.   Let's talk about the wait staff.   I feel as if when Cheddars hires their servers, they try to hire the worst ones in the Charlotte area. I've been to this establishment 8+ times and I have yet to have good service. The only reason I keep coming back is for the Afro mentioned.   The service is so bad it's frustrating to no end.   Drinks are always empty, appetizers never make it to the table, orders always come out incorrect and you usually get an attitude. The list of terrible things could really go one but I don't have time for that.   I'll probably give this place another chance and then I'm done. Don't waste your time.",

Oh and the glassware yea I watched how they \"wash\" their glasses, I'm not surprised if anyone hasn't gotten sick drinking or eating here! They literally submerged a glass in barely in each sinks of the 3. I've worked food industry and this is not how it's suppose to be sanitized! The manager some incompetent guy who behaves like a pal to his employees and not a leader! Omg worst service over received in such a long time!!!!  After seeing all that I just wanted my money back couldn't even get the manager to come to me never came!!! Just left! I'm disgusted and irked that I threw away $8.58",

    "text": "I've been going to Cheddar's for years and it has always been on point! An absolute must are the honey butter croissants! You will be hooked aftert he 1st bite! Trust me. You don't want to pass these up.  Also if you're looking for a tasty adult beverage you definitely should try the Pain Killer. It's pineapple coconut rum goodness! There's also a two pain killer max so you will feel a little warm while partaking ;)  Now on to the food...EVERYTHING I have ever ordered has always been good. I would highly recommend the ribs and shrimp, spasagna, cheese sticks, tilapia, tortilla soup, chicken Alfredo and what I like to call the Cookie Monster! Sooooooo good!  This place is total comfort. If you're looking for a delicious filling meal this place is it  I will say it's a little on the loud side because it's always packed because the food is THAT good! but once you get situated you hardly notice. Or just order the pain killer and croissants and you definitely won't notice.   P.S. If you are a ranch dressing lover like myself this place has some of the best I've had!!! Seriously. I don't play about my ranch.",

I was there this past Sunday and it was just awful.  I do not want to give it a star.  I received the corn as a side and it was so salty I could not get passed two bites.  Then I ordered the ribs and chicken fingers. They placed the chicken fingers right in the juice of the corn so now the fingers are way to salty to eat and soggy.  I had to ask for another plate and they looked at me like I was the crazy one.  Well I see they have been bought by Darden so I am hoping they clean up the place.  The rest rooms were nasty, the floors, and the table.  That place has just gone down hill.  They need a cleaning crew to just clean up the place.  So disappointed.",

If you must go to this place on a weekend, go early as possible, otherwise find a seat and get comfortable waiting. Although this advice is pointless on Sundays because it's pretty busy from open to close due to the church crowd.   Personally, I don't find the food worth waiting no more than 15 minutes for. Also the service is nothing special.  Cheddar's offers all the typical American food: ribs, salads, burgers, chicken of all kinds, fish tacos,etc. My favorites are the honey croissants, bourbon glazed salmon, and the key west chicken and shrimp.   It's a good place to grab a good, hot meal but nothing remarkable.",

    "text": "Well.... this makes me sad, but Cheddar's in Charlotte is only getting 2 stars from me and it's solely based on service. I was in town for a meeting and a few of us decided to grab a bite before I left town. Everyone agreed on Cheddar's because we typically enjoy the food and you can't beat the prices.   We were seated immediately, but we sat in our seat for about 25 minutes before a server came by to introduce themselves or get drink orders. Two members of our party were there before we arrived so that was about 30 minutes. A hostess came by an apologized to us and said she'd have the manager take care of our appetizers for the wait. Later our server came by and he was very nice. He was apologetic, but he didn't have to be. We weren't seated in his section, the hostess asked him to take care of our table.   The food was good. I usually get the Key West Chicken and Shrimp, but this time I ordered the Mango Talapia with carrots and broccoli casserole. I also had edamame. Everyone at our table was pleased with the food. The group seated behind us encountered the same problem. They hadn't placed drink orders or met their server. The group complained and we shared that we'd just encountered the same issue. Cheddar's was surprisingly over staffed that day. Everywhere you looked there was a server, but apparently the section assignments were wrong. The manager came out to the group seated near us and began to explain as well as help the servers get orders.   By this time, we'd all finished our food. We were patiently waiting for our bill, while we watched the madness unfold behind us. It took us another 15 minutes to get our bill and the appetizers had not been comped. Everyone was ready to go and paid quickly without even bringing up the promise the hostess made earlier.   I think the food is always good at Cheddar's, but this is the first time I've experience such poor service with so many servers on staff. Stop by if you have time, seriously, about 2 and half hours is required.",

    "text": "Sooooo this is my 3rd time coming to this specific Cheddars location. The first time my hubby and i grabbed a quick meal at a table top in the bar. Above was ok but the food was consistent with our numerous experiences.    The second time we came on a Friday night with our 3 children.  It was obvious it had been an extremely busy evening as the tables weren't bussed throughout the restaurant. There was a line through the door.  Staff were leaving on the hostess stand.  So we left.    Here I am for a third visit. To celebrate my daughter's 11th birthday. The line is out the door. Tables are empty through every dining room.  Im told it will be a 35-40 minute wait as they're short on silverware.  Huh?   How do you run out of silverware at a chain restaurant. So like an idiot i ask the question expecting a reasonable answer....\"The roller came late.\"  I couldn't help but continue down this path.  I ask,  \"What is a roller?\"  She responds confidently,  \"The person that rolls the silverware came to work late.\"  Now I'm officially annoyed.  Are you kidding me.  If the silverware is clean seat me and the other people that's waiting.  Bring us clean unrolled silverware.  If management can't handle a single person arriving at work late and roll the silverware then they have huge problems.  This location is not typical.  I'm so annoyed and still waiting for a table.  That silverware better be perfect and beautifully rolled. Ugh....... It's my kids choice for her birthday. MERCY ME! !!",

Our waitress (can't remember her name) spoke so low we could barely hear her. She looked as if she didn't have a care to even be there working. She never told us the specials, didn't try to sell us appetizers and failed to refill our drinks throughout the night. On two occasions she brought us FLAT sodas. My cosmopolitan was extremely over poured and disgusting. I took the drink to the bar and politely asked if I could get another one to replace mine. The bartender replied to another coworker saying, \"can you make this girl another drink because obviously I don't know how to pour.\" Seriously? On top of all of this, this waitresses section we were in was disgusting. It was dirty, floors slippery, food all over the place. I cannot say how nasty it was. Our food was cold, and dry. Sort of like it sat on the counter for a while. I will not return to this place! If I could give it 0 stars I would! Don't waste your money here unless you want ghetto, slow service.",

I am familiar with this chain because my hometown has one and I love it. The service was ok, it could have been better but the food did make up for it. I ordered steak and ribs. The steak needed no other sauces other than what it was cooked in and the ribs were so meaty. I couldn't devour them fast enough. I ordered broccoli as well and it was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I wonder do they cook this good every day or was it just a good day to visit. Either way I can't rave enough about my food. The waiter wasn't as attentive as he could be but it wasn't a big problem. If I lived in Charlotte I could see me eating here quite often. It's a win-win situation, you get good food and at a great price!!!",

She said had no apology when I told her I had been waiting for over 10 minutes, which is rude in itself. This unfortunately is my experience almost every time I come here.   As I said previously the food really is delicious especially for the price. Standard but good southern food, I love their fried chicken plate & steaks. The buttered corn is my favorite! And their drinks are great and HUGE as well. Almost all of the mixed cocktails are served in giant margarita fish bowl style glasses.

We were greeted immediately and headed over to the bar area to eat in the dining booths across from the bar to avoid a long wait. For starters we had two orders of the spinach artichoke dip with nachos, which was pretty good. The nachos were served in a large portion and they were warm. The dip was fresh and creamy. Safe to say we finished both orders before our entrees came out.   For our entrees we all did the New Orleans Pasta which came with shrimp, chicken and sausages with penne pasta. O.M.G. It was tasty! The chicken, shrimp sausages were all seasoned well and the pasta rich and creamy and not to mention zesty! No wonder why this dish is one of the fan favorites of the establishment. I will most certainly be returning based upon this dish, the dip and the service.",

    "text": "Perhaps Friday night was not the night to go?   The place was packed so my girlfriends and I decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited. I ordered a margarita...and it was pretty yummy.  And for a very reasonable price! The bartenders were all very nice and hilarious...they seem like they know how to have a good time.   But that's pretty much where our good times ended. After we were seated and given our menus our very unenthusiastic waitress arrived and asked if we were ready to order?!? We. Just. Sat. Down....so Ummm...no...not yet can we have a few moments?   Literally, after TWO minutes she was back...still not enough time to review the menu which has a pretty good variety and again very reasonable prices. So we asked for a few more moments, and she seemed annoyed but obliged. Now, don't get me wrong I'm all about attentive service...if it had been that I wouldn't mind but I hate feeling rushed! Especially after I just waited 30 minutes for a table!   When she returned we were ready, I ordered the tilapia with mango salsa with comes topped so shrimp over rice with the choice of two sides. I asked for the mango salsa on the side, and ordered the broccoli and cheese casserole and buttered corn.   After we ordered we waited and waited. Our waitress didn't make another appearance so we were left with empty glasses, no napkins or silverware. However, another server finally brought out our food...still NO silverware or napkins....so we asked if she could bring them....nothing....so we waited some more. Then when we finally found our waitress we asked again, she said she would, be right back with the silverware and again we WAITED. Finally, we tracked out another waiter and finally got our silverware and napkins...UGH!   The sad part is that the food was actually really good. My fish was seasoned so well and it shrimp on top were the perfect compliment. the mango salsa was really good too...but I'm glad I got it on the side. But since the service was lacking and it was a complete madhouse in our section I just can't really say I'm a total fan of this place.   So for now, everything was just okay. Honestly, based on experience alone they deserve 2 stars but the food bumped them up to a 3 star. I guess I will give them another chance on a different night, with a different server and HOPE that it's a better experience.",

The service is great and they have given me several delicious food item suggestions that have become my favorites - The Caesar pasta salad with salmon is fantastic. Easily four stars () on these days.  Today, however, I was able to sit in the bar AREA after waiting over 15minutes for someone to clean off three available tables.  The manager was not friendly when I asked about a table being cleared and that was disappointing.  My waitress was friendly and provided good service.  It's just the overall vibe was different.  I get my food and my shrimp hadn't be cleaned properly! Item returned and they give me chicken instead of salmon.  I'm too done.  Spoke to the manager and said to forget it.  I wasted 45 minutes and still had not one bite of food.   Plus they really need to do something about those slate floors. I'm surprised more people haven't slipped.  Rule of thumb: Don't come here on a Sunday.  I'll be back during the week when I know the service is better.",

This casual family restaurant, founded in Arlington, Texas boasts that they want to \"be a great restaurant that serves quality food fresh from the kitchen in a friendly, comfortable atmosphere at a fair price.\" I believe they accomplish this.  For lunch I chose the Homemade Chicken Pot Pie served with a fresh Caesar salad. The Pot Pie was full of chunky chicken, potatoes and vegies, and a tasty cream sauce. The crust was flaky, golden brown, and just the right thickness.  Dora here. Candy pecans, honey lime dressing and a finger-licking-buttery croissant jazzed up an ordinary salad to over-the-top for me, and I could drink a gallon of their unsweet tea.  I would rate this restaurant five forks out of five for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.",

As they continued to talk amongst each other I became more annoyed. One of them mentioned that one of the employees would be late because she had to dry her clothes!!! Seriously? She'd be fire!!!! Than they had everyone running around confused. They were saying to customers \"We're short of staff\", & oh yeah we're in the process of a shift change. When you're hungry no one wants to heart that!!! Never again will I come on here. To top it off the outside was deck was closed! Can you guess why? Of course short of staff. When they sat us down I swear there were like 10 tables empty. You couldn't even sit at the bar, no staff!!! This place is sorry & ghetto!!! DON'T ever come here!!! Not worth an hour wait",

I ordered the Lime Chicken and it came with two LARGE pieces of chicken, a side of steamed broccoli and a side of rice. I could only eat half and had to take the other half home. My husband ordered a steak with 2 sides and still had left overs to add to mine. When we got our bill, it was under $20 dollars for the two of us.   We went on a Saturday night and the parking lot was packed, there were people gathered in the lobby area and many large groups. We put our name on the list and were told the wait was 20 minutes. We were set within 10 minutes and they had also seated the large groups and the majority of those waiting. Our waitress was very attentive and even offered suggestions for parring of our meals. When I asked for hot sauce of my chicken the waitress brought it back along with several other dipping sauces, just to try!!! The honey lime sauce was AMAZING! When we were packing up our leftovers the waitress brought out a separate to-go cup of the sauce so I could enjoy it with the rest of my meal!   The only downside is the noise level and you feel like sometimes you have to yell to talk to the person across from you. This may have been attributed to the numerous birthday groups and other large groups though.",

The waiter was super nice and others assisted him with the large party as needed (great teamwork).  The restaurant also has an okay wine selection to complement your meal.

This restaurant is usually busy as I feel as if it's another Hops, but cheaper burgers and more of a hang out atmosphere.  One bad thing about this place is the amount of seating and how big of a group you can bring. They only have 2 big tables seated for 6+ and sometimes my friends and I have to split the tables.  I've been here many times with friends for lunch and dinner and it seems like every time the service is just mediocre. Understood though, that it has gotten better since the last time I was there.  I recommend the Mushroom Swiss Burger or the Chicken Pot Pie, both are my favorites. The pasta isn't that bad either.",

We had the manager come over, and explained to him that I've seen episodes of Bar Rescue go better than Cheddar's was today.

    "text": "I used to love eating here. The food used to seem good and fresh and then it took a turn for the worst. The service is terrible. I think almost every waiter has seemed a little off in the head, like they couldn't process things correctly, or their brain constantly throws error messages when faced with any type of situation.... I think immature and unprofessional is the best way to describe them. Some of the waiters have no professional and service-based decorum. It didn't used to be like that though. There is usually always a wait especially on weekends. I think people really love this place because it's inexpensive and the portions are relatively large. But the quality of the food is reflected in the price. This stuff is definitely frozen, you can just tell, and not the good frozen because you know frozen food isn't all bad, but this is. It's a good place to take a group if you're the only one paying, but be prepared to wait and deal with weird waiters that just don't have it together. I blame management, the wait staff is a reflection of them. Honestly I've seen a manager or two here and I it makes sense.",

The biggest whiner in the world and totally yelp trolls and hater with no soul or conscious.  Is yelp becoming a place for complainers? in the old days, in order to write review you have to have some credits. Now with yelp platform, which they use to make money, but some users like Saniqua and Robert mady just use to spread hate toward an individual or business because they didnt get what they want? Seriously Elite status on yelp because you have alot free time doesnt make you a better person or above anyone.  Telling other people dont go this restaurant or that restaurant or its not worth it , just because you didnt get your ass kiss are just a type of hate? The same kind of hate like hitler ? Robert mady are you a version of Laos hitler? or just a person with no conscience? or no moral? or simply no soul? or no heart? is ?is your head not been awake? Consciousness is when we feel the suffering of every creature within our hearts. whether it is the waiter that serve you or the manager that couldnt please you or the owner that have to read your stupid reviews. Be a better person.  become a part of the solution.  compliment not critize When your soul has been awake you wouldnt be on yelp writing all these stupid reviews.",

I ordered their Baja Chicken which was really a bowl of beans, some rice, some chicken, and a small amount of pico de gallo. I asked our server for another side of pico de Gallo. I'm still waiting for it- I'll let you know if it ever arrives. We ordered another round of drinks (our mistake). Service was so slow we decided to get lime wedges from the bar instead.

    "text": "Let's start with the wait time being ridiculous at over an hour and a half. Not that the restaurant was packed because there were so many empty tables. Staff was late causing a major delay... But there were at least 4 hostesses??? The experience was sad to say the least.   I gave them 1 star because our waiter was working several areas of large parties and still found the time to entertain my high energy toddler. The second star because those chicken tenders were the the most plump and juicy tenders we've ever encountered. That's where the good ended.   So I'm a sweet tea kind of person and often times tea can be too sweet with it tasting more like sugar water with a hint of tea flavor. This sweet tea had no sugar it actually was slightly less sweet than the unsweetened tea. The food portions and quality was very inconsistent at our table of four.  We had to order our steaks medium rare to get it close to get it close to medium which still arrived at our table medium well. The shrimp and other seafood just tasted fried. The sides were cheesy or very overcooked.  I will not be returning here. It seemed like a large bar instead of a restaurant. At the price point I didn't expect great but I would have settled for okay. Granted I haven't been to this restaurant in years but it was a major disappointment for the wait. Huge Saturday night mistake.",

There was a wait mid day on a Saturday, which surprised me. Fortunately, there were enough televisions in the bar area that I could watch my Tar Heels while I ate and made small talk.   I ordered spinach dip and the cajun pasta. The spinach dip was pretty good, especially since I was hungry. Their chips were homemade. The dip was a creamier version with a dollop of sour cream.  My pasta was decent. I didn't like the sausage that was in it wasn't andouille. It was more of a breakfast sausage and they were in big chunks. The shrimp were great, blackened, and with the tail on. There were only three. If I had to do it over again, I'd substitute all meat for shrimp. The pasta was average with a sauce that was forgettable. If I go back to Cheddar's I'll probably choose something else.",

The waitress did not have any other table but ours and even the one person in our group that ordered water was still not served.

My man, my mom and I walked in and you could tell the food here had to be good 'cause there were a bunch of people waiting for a table. To our surprise, however, we were told the wait would only be between 11-17 mins which was awesome!!! So we waited for literally 5 minutes and a very pleasant server walked up and told us there was seating available in the bar area -- which means we didn't have to wait!!! Yay!   Within minutes our server, Xavier, came over and took our drink order, and we also ordered the spinach artichoke dip. By the time he brought our drinks, we already knew what we wanted to order... Fish tacos, Dijon Chicken and Mushrooms, and Steak & Shrimp. He barely walked away to put in our order before he came around the corner again to bring out the spinach and artichoke dip. Phenomenal!!! Ooey gooey melted cheese with spinach, topped with a dollop of sour cream, along with freshly made chips, and a side of salsa. Ya, we devoured it pretty quick!   Minutes later, our food arrived bubbling hot from the kitchen, smelling divine! Everything was so flavorful and tasty, we nearly licked the plates clean! Needless to say, the service, food, and atmosphere was absolutely great!!! We came in extremely famished/hangry, but we definitely left satisfied and happy! Well done, Cheddar's, another group of happy customers!   P.S. Anyone that gave Cheddar's a less than perfect review must've gone on a terrible evening; or perhaps your tastebuds misled you... So try it again, you won't regret it!",

Our croissants weren't put in at all, I had to remind our server about them. Our entrees came out cold & very underwhelming. I had the Key West Chicken & Shrimp with mashed potatoes & green beans.... the chicken was tough & dry, the shrimp & potatoes were decent, the green beans not only looked gross but also tasted like the can they came out of.

I had the citrus salmon, surprisingly good flavors for a chain restaurant! I tried a couple of other dishes from everyone's plate, it was all okay. I agree with the other reviewers about the restaurant's potential, the prices are very reasonable for mediocre food (esp if you have big groups). But their menus were sticky & so were the floors, their sprite tasted like bland carbonated diet water? We were informed that they \"ran out\", so what was that drink that they gave us?? Overall I think the only thing I would come again for is for their mouthwatering croissants!(:",

    "text": "Went on a busy Saturday night and expected a crowd. There was a huge crowd but we were there for a birthday dinner so we decided to stick it out. We had a group of ten and waited from 6:20 to 7:50 to get seated. When we were seated we got placed at separate tables. Not fun for the birthday girl to have to step back and forth from table to table to see her friends. They said that the large table they had for large groups had been occupied for about 2 hours and the folks weren't leaving.   The menu has been updated (and i didn't grab a picture) and they have literally everything. Definitely something for everyone on the menu. I went with the favorites section and got the New Orleans pasta. Large portion and very tasty. The frozen drinks that were on special were also good.   Our waitresses initially fought over who got what table because of the tip I guess? I mean they confronted each other right there in front of us. But the service we received was subpar. Numerous times we were without drinks or forgotten items. I asked for waters at one point and she came back with just one glass for me since I asked when 3 other people had empty glasses. At other times we would just see them all hanging out backs on the wall with managers right there! Confusing when the restaurant was so busy. Wasn't a bad time but I'll stick to other restaurants in the Charlotte area.",

We had a spinach dip , very good. We splurged on the monster cookie, even better the check was under 30 dollars. Highly recommend.....",

Then our server came back about 15min later to take our drink order and meal order at the same time. Then I asked a few min later if I could change my sides to a salad at which point the server rolled his eyes and huffed the said ok. Then our food came out 15min later at which point he asked what dressing I wanted. I said I didn't need the salad that what I had was fine.  My father ordered a ribeye which was cut wrong,, he had an awful time trying to cut it and eat it.  Our drinks were never refilled.  It has been a very unpleasant meal.  We have dined at many restaurants and this was one of the worst serving experiences.  I also didn't realize that croissant don't come with your meal.",

I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and substituted for veg pattie. Anyway, first bite, I'm in love!",

I ordered the Spasagna and and a side salad ($1.99 for the salad).  The so called Spasagna was nothing more that macaroni and cheese with a little spaghetti sauce over it.  It was not good at all.  A pretty dry lump of food. The side salad was nothing but lettuce from a bag of lettuce, no olives, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc., just about two handfuls of lettuce for $1.99   I will say, however, I was with three other people and they seemed to enjoy their meals. Personally, I probably won't go back",

My parents had had nothing but great things to say about the food and the service and they went on the recommendation of my cousins who always stop by on their way through town also. We went on Mother's day so I was expecting a long wait. (They don't take reservations or call-ahead seating). Surprisingly we were seated immediately. Our waiter was prompt and friendly. He knew quite a bit about the menu items and made several helpful suggestions. I had a bite (well, more than a bite) off everyone's plate and everything was excellent! Really great prices too, I don't think anyone's meal cost over $12 and we all left stuffed. From the looks at the other reviews, it appears as if the staff, service, and food have been revamped. I encourage everyone with bad prior reviews to give them a second chance.",

It seems like they lie about the wait time in order get people's business  keeping customers waiting standing in line for over an hour, which would only lead customers to be aggravated and end up with a sour experience, I know that with this bad experience I will make sure my family and friends will never go back to cheddars, hey but \"who cares as the manager Pam says\"",

After a few days of thought and the statement \" just let us know when your coming\"       I kept thinking why let them know that I am coming?For what special treatment? THAT WOULD BE A NO!

So, I thought I would call their bluff I called the Corporate guys( I think the owners of the franchise) and with a very short fuse I told them I was coming back .       Just as I thought I was sent a message can you give us a \"little more time\" for what? Are they closing the restaurant to retrain? That would be a NO?

I always gauge a restaurants quality by the size of its Sysco or other Food company's  Monthly bill!! The hirer this is the less they cook! And if the value of the customer is any sign how they value the care they take with your meal then take 3 shots of Cabo and call me in the morning.",

I was feeling a little nostalgic and begged my hubby to drive all the way from Matthews back to Cheddar's for dinner the other night. Bad decision. This place has gone waaaaaaay downhill. I ordered my favorite potato soup for an appetizer, and it arrived COLD!?!?!? My burger was beyond greasy, I couldn't even eat it and I lost my appetite fast. My husband was not happy with his food and stopped at Taco Bell on the way home for some \"quality\" food, lol. What happened to the Cheddar's I loved in 2005?",

My likes: the buttery sweet warm crossiants, spinach dip, and the nachos. This is a place you can take anyone..your baby niece, your grandmother, your brother and everyone is happy unless they are a food snob. The wait staff is slow but its Charlotte and the south is traditionally slow with service.",

The appetizer and food came out fast and hot but once the food came everything else took longer than we expected. The grilled shrimp and ribs were great and comes with two sides. To our surprise the grilled shrimp our served on a bed of rice so it was like getting a bonus side! You honestly can't come here without getting a order of croissants they are buttery deliciousness!   After the food came we rarely saw our waitress and our drinks for the bar took a long time to come. We were practically done with our meals before the came. There was a long wait for to go boxes and normally if you ask for to go boxes the waitress would know you were ready for the check but we were left again waiting for a while for the check. It was a Friday night but it was around 9pm so the restaurant wasn't busy after all the kitchen was fast it was just the bar and service that wasn't. This is one of the few chains I really like so I'm sure I'll be back but I hope the experience is better.",

After another 15 minutes I asked the hostess to track down our waitress, because we had not received our drinks yet. I even found the a lady that said she was the manager and informed her, she really seemed to care less. Our drinks finally came and were told the croissants were coming fresh out of the oven. Once we got them they were not completely done but the parts that were done were pretty tasty. My husband ordered the salmon with rice, which he said was average. My step-son ordered ribs, no complaints, but he eats anything. My daughter had chicken strips and fries, which she seemed to like. I ordered the country fried steak, when I cut it open, the meat seem to deflate and a large amount of juice came out to reveal a purplish color meat. I was not too sure but  took a bite anyway. I decided not to finish the meal. The waitress was very nice and offered to order me something else and put it on rush. Initially I told her that it was fine I just wanted to leave the restaurant and not have to wait another 45 minutes for food. I gave in and carried out a bourbon pork chop.  The waitress was also servicing a table next to us, I noticed that she had gotten their order wrong a couple of times.  Upon finishing our meal our check was debited for the wrong amount, once it was corrected we hurried to leave the restaurant. Upon our exit another couple mentioned to the hostess that they had been seated but were leaving because no one came to take their order. The hostess unapologetically sounding said that she was sorry.. it seems as though customer service and quality of food are not a concern for this establishment. I do not recommend!!!",

I had heard the burgers were large and cheap (just like I like them!).  I can confirm on both points, the burger was large, juicy with plenty of flavor and for something like $6 I got the burger and a drink included.  Not bad if I do say so myself!  I'll be back Cheddar's!  Not a dig on the place, but be careful they will charge you extra for certain sides.  I was charged $2 for cole slaw...come on...sneaky devils!",

Joshua was our server, and while capable I guess, there was no urgency.  Now I know it is not Ruth's Chris or anything, but I have had more interest in the business from Jason's Deli or Jimmy John's subs!  We had spinach dip, and it had clearly been sitting - it was lukewarm with a skin on top.  Our food arrived several minutes after expected in every case and was lukewarm every dish.  Parents had the buffalo chicken wrap, a usual favorite, and it was lukewarm.  Kids food also.  To top it off we ordered the monster cookie.  Now on the menu it says to allow several minutes for baking.  They allowed several minutes extra I guess, because it had clearly been sitting awhile before being brought out, the ice cream was half melted - so much soup of ice cream you could not see the cookie.  Nice.    Now ok, it was Sunday, and they had some full tables.  So I expected a little wait.  But when the food is done you bring it out : it should still arrive hot.  We have small kids, and don't need to spend money out, so we pick and choose.  I'll be picking Bravo or Chili's again LOTS of times before picking Cheddars again.",

As I waited for my takeout order I listened to several staff member complain about how they could not wait to get off of work and how they had 30 minutes to go only to make a two dollar tip. I also listen to them complain about people walking in 15 to 30 minutes before closing and question why they would walk in to an establishment just before closing and how the food and the service was going to be horrible due to the restaurant closing shortly. I also watched a waitress literally roll on he floor in laughter because of her co-workers comments about the tips they had received from their last customers...it was a total disgrace for the person who was left in charge to monitor that establishment. Needless to say I was with a friend from out of town who said \"I hope their behavior is not a reflection of how my food is going to taste\" and all I could do was shake my head and apologize for your staffs behavior when it was not my responsibility to do so! Here is a tip...either clean house or host some training sessions on how to remain professional while on the job!!!! I will not patronize your establishment again but will visit others out of town!",

    "text": "This review is really just based on service. I went here Thursday June 12 and the service was horrible. When the waiter was putting down the napkins instead of walking around the table when it came to placing napkins on the other side, the waiter just tossed them. You would think the waiter would have known before we placed our drink orders that they were out of coke and sprite. So that was strike 1. The 2nd strike was accumulated when I ordered the country fried steak. After we ordered our food, the waiter comes back to let me know they are out of country fried steak. After that I decided to get the fried chicken steak which my aunt asked if I can get the dinner portion at the lunch price. The waiter stated with an attitude let me get the manager. So David the manager stated he wasn't able to do that for some reason. The whole time I was there I'm just thinking how do you run out of all this stuff and the restaurant had only been opened for like a hour or two. Overall I will never ever go back to this establishment!",

There were 8 of us, on a Monday....the restaurant was pretty dead- and plenty of staff working. This was our 2nd time dining here, we came last year for lunch the day after the race aNd had a great lunch. Not the case this year- our very forgetful server looked like she'd been partying the night before at the Coca Cola 600 (we looked pretty bad too!) and was just unfriendly, short, so unapologetic and not accommodating at all. One of us waited no lie 30 minutes on a bud light...because they had to \"refill it.\" She didn't clear any dishes during our hour and a half lunch- when a drink refill finally came she couldn't be bothered to remove the used glass. My Monte Cristo was warm but damn good! Burgers were dry and overcooked, plates were sloppy-certainly Not worth a 30 minute wait. Overall, the poor service left us with a negative attitude..",

I love the decor of the place especially the fans that are huge leaves and the fish tank. The booths are HUGE and can accommodate 4 people to a row easy. Not to mention, they're wide enough to shove a car seat into them without a struggle.  The wait staff has always been nice, attentive, and they pay attention to details (I am kind of a picky eater so this is a huge plus for me). A couple of them will sit down with you and chat just a little if you're in the mood to have company (but they don't linger too long).   The food has always been great! I've had their burgers (which are cooked to order perfectly), chicken dishes (haven't had a dry piece of chicken yet), and their salads. My food has always been hot (or nice and cool for the salad), on time, and full of flavor. I recommend their burgers though, they actually season the ground beef before throwing it on the grill (yes, I've been to places that don't do that).  If you're not full after eating all the food you got, don't forget about dessert! Their desserts are humongous and it'll take at least 2 people to eat the whole thing. I've had all of their desserts and I recommend all of them. They range from a death by chocolate cake, to a simple ice cream sundae.  This is a great place to just chill, have a few drinks, and enjoy great food. I would recommend this to everybody.",

It can get really busy and loud sometimes, especially on Fri &Sat evenings/ Sunday afternoons.  I will say the service leaves a lot to be desired. No one has yet to be horrible, but we have had our share of very clumsy/forgetful/ unattentive. We have also noticed that the spinach dip does not taste the same as before like they skimped on the cheese/something. It has a strange aftertaste. The flavored teas are always nice and honey croissants are addictive.  To sum it up, if you want a decent meal for under $12 pp ( including drink) , then this is your place.",

This time I got the cheese bites as an appetizer which they were hot and fresh and delicious. My main course this time I went with the lemon pepper chicken with rice, a side of corn as well as the broccoli casserole which all I will say were amazing. The only thing I can really say I don't like about this place is the silverware kind of feels cheap. Maybe that's just me but I feel like they really went cheap with it. It doesn't feel good in my hand at all which I know is kind of weird haha. Besides that if you come here check out the broccoli casserole it is to die for!",

This is one of the very few places I eat where I always try and get something new.  I'm never disappointed with anything I've ordered.  This time I ordered the Dijon chicken with mushrooms.  The meal is two char-grilled breasts served over rice and topped with a honey-Dijon sauce.  The mushrooms are more of a side thought rather than part of the dish.  It comes with two sides so I got the broccoli casserole and macaroni and cheese.  It's a lot of food and it's inexpensive, making it a great value.  The Dijon sauce was a bit on the sweet side so I scraped some of it off the chicken to make my meal more enjoyable.  The chicken was a bit tough on the outside, but not too chewy and still edible.  The mushrooms were salty.  I could live with or without the rice; it was just the average rice pilaf.",

There was not enough macaroni and cheese to complete three orders of macaroni and cheese there was only enough for one says the waitress. We asked her to put the macaroni and cheese with the burger and then just double fries and double fries with the shrimp . the food was then brought out but the order was completely discombobulated everything was wrong. And an astronomical amount of fries came out with the order. it was almost as if she canceled all the original sides and replace it with french fries. We're probably there an extra 15-20 minutes from when the food originally should have been out. The whole ordeal was extremely frustrating as they were very busy and it took too long so we left.",

Normally this would not be an issue since that is our customary routine but with Hip Surgery, less than two weeks ago, still playing it by ear.  Pulled in about 11:45 am just ahead of the Church rush. My wife dropped me off at the front door while she found a parking spot. I made it to the top of the steps on crutches when the manager ran out to hold the doors for me (both sets) which helped they were quite heavy.  They went ahead and seated me while we waited for my wife.  Nice decor and with the horizontal ceiling fans, reminds me of the old Bombay Bicycle Club Chain of restaurants from years past.  Wife joined me and our server was there to take our drink menu's and to present us with menus.  Both of us ordered Sweet Tea although I ordered it 1/2 and 1/2 and glad I did. Hate to think how it would have tasted if it were straight Sweetened Tea.  Nice menu with something for everyone.  I ordered the Country Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes, Gravy and Cheesy Broccoli Casserole for my entree.  My wife ordered a Philly Cheese Steak with a side of corn for her's.  While we waited, we had a chance to observer the dining room. Nice and light and airy with a Deep South Atmosphere. I loved the aquarium at one end but so did most of the kids who came it as well.  Lunch came out in short order.  Server apologized because when they came in that morning, the kitchen had made to wrong gravy and I was going to have to wait for a few. No problem and when it came it was good. The Broccoli Casserole was somewhat dry though.  The Country Fried Steak and the Potatoes were excellent and let's face it, they are the highlight of the meal.  My wife enjoyed her Philly Cheese Steak but I will admit, I am used to a Philly Cheese Steak being bright yellow because of the type cheese used.  Nevertheless, she enjoyed it and portions were large enough, she finished it off this evening.  Came time to leave and everyone was grabbing and holding doors again. I'm not helpless but the gesture was appreciated and it extended beyond the staff. Other Patrons were trying to help as well.  Great commentary on the Spirit of Easter",

    "text": "We used to love to eat at Cheddar's, but we ended up moving to the other side of town and haven't eaten there for a long time. We recently moved back into the area and decided to try them for dinner.   Sad to say, this place is terribly managed now.   We wanted to do carry out, so I called to place my order. The hostess put me on hold and forwarded me to the bar for them to take my order. I waited 5 minutes and no one picked up. I hung up and called again. Again, the hostess said she would forward me to the bar. I told her what happened on the first call and she said, \"Oh, I'll take your order in just a minute\" and put me on hold. I waited another five minutes and hung up.   We weren't going to be put off that easy. We decided, maybe they're busy, and we drove to the restaurant to eat-in.   When we got there (a little after 5:30 on a Sunday evening) we were told it would be a 15 minute wait. So, they were a little busy, but over a third of the tables we could see were empty.   The waitress was quick to take our order. I asked for the ribs. She smiled and said they were out of ribs. So, I ordered the chicken fingers instead. My daughter ordered a small steak, medium well. I asked to have some croissants for our appetizer (those are the main reason we used to love this place).   About 10 minutes later my salad was delivered, and the waitress let us know that they were out of croissants. They will make some more, but it will be 30 minutes. I asked to have them removed from the ticket.   10 minutes passed and we got our entrees. My tenders were fine,  but my daughters steak was undercooked. She ate it anyway.   I spent the majority of my meal without a drink as the waitress never brought refills despite being asked a couple times.   Daughter was disappointed in the experience, so I tried to salvage by ordering dessert. I asked for the fudge cake sundae, and was told that they are out of fudge cake.   So, put on eternal hold twice, out of stock on the entree and dessert I wanted, no bread prepped, and lackluster service. We won't be back.",

My wife and I were a little skeptical going during lunch as our previous visit had us being seated and getting no help(not even an offer of water) for over 30 minutes with an active 18 month old. This visit, we were seated pretty quickly in the bar area and Elisabeth was excellent. She greeted us just after being seated, and took our drink order. We originally placed an order for drinks and informed her that we preferred them with our food opposed to before and she was ok with that. 5 mins later after changing our minds, she was 100% okay with going ahead and making the before the food and her attitude did not change. The drinks were stellar and the food was pretty good. I would definitely recommend Cheddars for lunch time!",

My problem with my meal today was the service. One of the main reasons I go to Cheddar's is for the Cookie Monster so I know it takes a while to cook. As soon as we received our food I asked the waitress to put in an order for one, then she disappeared. We waited for half an hour before I finally went to the host stand and asked for our check and left without the cookie monster. Definitely disappointed in this experience, since it was a late lunch on a weekday they weren't busy so I'm not sure what happened.",

I had salmon with rice and broccoli cheese casserole. He had ribs and a ribeye steak with baked potato and salad. For an appetizer we had chips, salsa and queso with ground beef added (no extra charge.) We were very impressed by the quality of the chips. Warm and thin like a Mexican restaurant. The salsa and queso were very good. The salmon, steak and ribs were grilled to perfection.   In short I am happy to that food and service are back up to par.",

While the food is mediocre, at least Billy's offers great service.  Next time, I am just going to have to make a drive somewhere to find a decent meal with good service.  I know Charlotte has better to offer, don't you?  Tonight I tried again.  I got salad, dinner and cocktail all within 5 minutes of ordering and all at the same time.  I never learn....",

Arrived here at 9:04 (restaurant closed at 10) and was told there was only 1 server working and the wait would exceed the time remaining for them to be open.   The hostess was unpleasant and seemed annoyed that we were even there. My issues are: I called this place in advance to confirm there hours so someone should've stated then they were short staffed etc. secondly, I understand the hostess probably wanted to get off so she could celebrate HOWEVER, when you accept a job in the food service industry, you acknowledge and accept the fact that you will be sacrificing your time which will include working on HOLIDAYS.   Needless to say, I will not give this restaurant a 2nd chance no matter how great the food could be.  As the saying goes, you never get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression and my 1st impression wasn't pleasant.",

We provided the waitress with a gift card to cover the  meal, and provided a debit card to cover the remaining balance. Instead the waitress charged us for the entire bill and kept the gift card for herself and never gave the gift card back. I am so disappointed that an employee from this establishment would do something like that. Even though management said that the amount will be credited back to our card. It was a hassle to even get to that point. If i could give cheddars a 0 star i would! will NEVER come to this cheddars again!",

Of course we ordered a drink while there. Lets just say...our food came out before the drinks. So...no water, no tea, nor alcoholic beverage was brought to our table before our food. The restaurant was not busy at all, so we were confused on why we were waiting so long. We finally got our water and tea, while waiting on the alcohol to come. So mid way during our lunch we decided to cancel the drink order and she was like it was already made and expected us to pay for it. We politely declined and finished our meal, paid for our food and left. Not pleased at all today",

    "text": "My experience at this location was awful! We arrived at the restaurant around 6:30pm on August 26th...it wasn't crowded at all. We waited at the front for at least 15 minutes while staff walked by, chit-chatting with each in the aisles, not even bothering to ask if we were waiting to be seated. Finally, I asked if anyone was working there today. An Asian American young man, who had walked by us twice already without saying a word, followed me to the front check in desk. He looked over the diagram and asked if we would like a booth, I said yes. He then says \"well you can go sit over there\" merely waving my mother and myself in the direction of the bar area, not bothering to seat is at our table. We get over there and there are at least 4 tables COVERED in disgusting, filthy dishes! This place is beyond gross! Needless to say, we didn't even sit down. We left immediately! DO NOT EAT AT THIS CHEDDARS LOCATION! It is deplorable!!",

    "text": "I'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews.  This is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte and has actually has become, from this Charlotte franchise alone, one of my top favorite restaurants of all time in general!  I moved to Charlotte a few months ago, and before then, had never heard of - let alone been - to Cheddar's.  I went there with my boyfriend for the first time shortly after we got here, and omg... One of the best combinations of everything great in a great restaurant that I've ever encountered!  They have VERY reasonable prices...as others have mentioned, VERY good portions of food (especially for the price)...a very nice atmosphere and wait staff in all the times that I've gone...and the quality of their food ranges from good to spectacular.  I've since been to this Cheddar's maybe five or six times, and I honestly would've been more if it weren't for me trying to branch out and give other places in my area and the greater city a try as well.  It isn't any sort of \"specialty\" kind of restaurant - it's just the kind of place that offers a little bit of everything on its menu...but much of what they do offer - well, let me clarify...the things that I've had - for the most part seem to be pretty freaking great.  My boyfriend also really loves the place, by the way...  For years, I would never really be too impressed with the likes of Chilli's, T.G.I.Friday's, Applebee's, etc. because I felt their food and establishments were just....nothing special - nothing really special on their menu or about their business that set them apart from any other restaurant, let alone each other.  But the funny thing with Cheddar's is I would probably group it in the same category as those other restaurants, BUT...unlike those others, I REALLY love Cheddar's and, to me, it sets itself apart by offering consistently very good prices for consistently very good food in a consistently very good atmophere/setting.  Cheddar's has become my #1 favorite \"generic food\" type of restaurant by far.  Oh, and as at least one or two others have mentioned in their reviews, their buttery crossaints? MUAH!",

    "text": "I wish I would have referred to Yelp first - what's wrong with me?  My only excuse is it was someone else's suggestion/desire to come here.  Does that help redeem me at all?!  :)  I went here to meet former coworkers for lunch about a week ago and was quite impressed...at the MENU.  I'd heard mixed reviews about Cheddar's for quite some time, mainly concerning their slow service, so I was a bit skeptical.  But their surprisingly tasteful interior and impressive menu brought about hope.  I have to say, the impressiveness ends at the decor and the menu selections.  I said SELECTIONS.  I had trouble making up my mind, so many things looked/sounded so tasty.  I settled on the chicken tenders & shrimp combo and a Caesar side salad.  I was impressed that my entree came with two sides - wasn't expecting that, especially not for $9.99.  I selected the \"southern style\" green beans and baby carrots.   I must give credit where credit is due; the SIDE ITEMS were great.  But it ended there.  Neither the chicken nor the shrimp had any flavor to them whatsoever.  I was shocked.  I didn't even finish my chicken tenders because they didn't seem fully cooked to me.  The breading on them was very light in color, very flaky, and TASTELESS, as though it was nothing more than mere flour and maybe egg whites or buttermilk?  No seasoning at all.  Same with the shrimp.  Very blah to say the least.  And very disappointing.    Service I must admit was much better than expected, although bordering on smothering.  Had a very young waiter that seemed to try way too hard to \"be there\" for us and to try to be pleasant & friendly (was somewhat forced rather than genuine).  Started to get on my nerves (then again if you knew me, you'd know that when you begin getting smothery you're pushing my buttons big-time!).  However given the negative reviews I'd heard in the past regarding service, I'd rather have this than a non-existent server, so I quickly got over that.  He also didn't seem to be that familiar with the menu & its flexibility (ie: this can be subbed for that, etc), so that was a little bit of a turnoff to my dining companion.  In a nutshell University City has far too many dining options, so I wouldn't select Cheddar's again.  Even with commendable service, the food has to match, and this place just didn't work for me, not even a little.  I'd rather eat at Chick-Fil-A across the street!",

    "text": "I like to think of reviewing restaurants as being a bit like grading Olympic divers. Bear with me on this one. There are two scales: \"How difficult was the dive\" and \"How well did they execute?\"  Cheddar's doesn't have lofty aspirations. It's casual dining; my wife and I were looking for somewhere to go with our 1-year-olds, so \"kid friendly\" was a must. Found it on Yelp, and it was perfect. Decor is, as someone mentioned, kind of in the Applebees/Chilis zone, with less random stuff bolted to the wall than, say, Friday's. Service was the high point of a good experience. We were seated quickly by a host, and our server was  perfectly attentive - appearing when we needed her, disappearing when we didn't, and navigating effortlessly among two adults and two toddlers. The food was good. It wasn't fine-dining-wow-this-was-amazing good, but it was tasty. The Texas Cheese Fries were appropriately ridiculously huge; the kids' meals came (appreciatedly!) with veggies instead of fries. The kids liked their meals; we liked ours. Solid B+ on the food.  The prices were insanely good. Like \"Wait, did I read that right?\" good.  This would be a great place to go out as a family. I would guess, later in the evening, it wouldn't be a bad place for some broke college kids to scarf down a ton of food. Probably not a good place for a romantic dinner.",

    "text": "So I get a call from the general manager at from Cheddars...what another total waste of my time! The first conversation was typical, trying to locate our ticket & find out who our server was...after he locates the ticket he calls me back to say he found it & confirm that they did run out of the pain killer drink && give more excuses as to why...at the end of the conversation I concluded that not only do they employ incompetent servers, but the general manager as well. I guess when you have a general manager that lacks decent communication skills that one would need as a general manager, it is pretty impossible to coach/train decent servrs.. Here's a little piece of advise that I'm offering as a regional trainer (I train new managers) whenever you have an unsatisfied customer if you don't have any intentions of apologizing, and being accountable don't bother contacting them! Accept the bad review and keep it moving. For Adam to contact me and reiterate what his server said about then running out of popular menu items because he hasn't figured out a successful way to order inventory yet is laughable yet annoying all together! I really wish I could give this place -5 stars!",

He was fairly slow at getting items to the table, it was difficult for him to even get the drink order. My mom had a \"free appetizer\" coupon for signing up for their club, which she was charged for, and then which a manager came over and said \"you need to email that to us, and then we can print it out, and then we can take it off\". I reviewed the coupon, no where on it did it say we had to print the coupon off. Then, when my parents ordered their second glass of wine another server came back and asked us to take their glasses because they had to wash them out and pour the wine into the glass. The food was pretty good but the frustration with the coupon was annoying and the server seemed to be flustered throughout the course of the meal.",

    "text": "The only thing I've ever eaten at Cheddars is the Monte Cristo. All negative comments about Cheddars will have to be addressed to my arteries and heart.  For those of you unfamiliar with the Monte Cristo...it is turkey, ham, and cheese slapped between a couple of funnel cakes and fried in some deliciousness. Then they sprinkle some powdered sugar on it. This thing should be called the heart-stopper.   If you're going to a chain like Cheddars for something healthy...yawn...I ask why. Maybe the complaints about your salad at your favorite restaurant Applebees didn't teach you a lesson. Regardless of what's going on in your dome, this place is for ordering Monte Cristos...capiche?  Try: Using the grease on your hands to manage your split ends  Avoid: Eating your Cristo over anything other than your plate  **After eating your first bite of Cristo...you may inexplicably yell Booyah!",

I complained to the manager who sent another waiter. The new waiter apologized and asked that we give them another chance.  He stated that there was a problem with the first waiter and she lost our ticket.  We were patient and gave the new waiter our order. After another 15 minutes of waiting, and still not getting our drink we left.   This was the worse service I have ever received and will never go back. You won't be in business for long.",

When we got here, there was no wait & about 10 waiters standing by the hostess stand. They sat there for about 5 mins debating on where to put us. We asked for a booster seat & NEVER got one. Then when we asked about the dinner specials the waitress told us she didn't know what they were. So we asked her to go look then she told us half of the specials. My mom ordered a salad for a starter & we didn't have silverware for 10 mins. We asked another waitress if she could grab some since our waitress didn't come out yet & she told us they were wrapping them in the back & didn't have any although we already had our salad. Finally our waitress brought some & said they had some available. When we got the food, it was great but it was like warm so I had to have her warm it up. Overall, the food was good but do to the service, who knows if we will be back.",

We bussed our own table in the bar because they had a 30 minute wait.  But then we sat there for at least 5 minutes with servers walking by over and over without even smiling, saying hi or greeting us.  When the server finally came, all was well until our app (chips & queso) arrived with a long black hair on top of the chips.  That was fixed but when it came time to order, I couldn't upgrade or chose a soup instead of a salad.  Food was decent but certainly didn't get good service and definitely won't be back to this one.  I will give Cheddars another shot just not this one.",

The tilapia was average and it came with baby grilled shrimp on top. The mango salsa was horrible. The mango didnt even taste like mango. The rice that it came over was definitely pre-packaged and gross. The green beans were CANNED. What kind of restaurant serves canned vegetables?!? The broccoli was steamed so you cant really mess that up too badly. They only have four draft beers, bud, bud light, miller light, and yuengling. YAWN!  The service was not very good. Checked on me twice before my food even arrived, which was annoying, and never checked on me after i got my food until i was obviously finished. Just saw him standing next to the bar chit chatting with coworkers. He didnt even have the patience to wait til i left to take the checkbook. As soon as i closed it, he made sure to come right over to take it. I was there by myself so i wasnt trying to stay long at all. Didnt even get a thank you. Ungrateful jerk.  All in all, im never going to Cheddars ever again and recommending people to never go there.",

First I asked for the chicken and waffle...had my mouth geared up for a waffle and the waitress comes back to say that they had chicken but out of waffles...................I don't understand, on a Sunday afternoon when people are coming in for brunch, im going to need you to have waffles.   Okay so then I order salmon which tasted under cooked...it was too soft. I wasn't expecting it to be burned but it tasted weird,  like it needed to be left on the grill a bit longer. So, now I'm 0-2.   Then I get the loaded potatoe skins...........they too tasted too soft and bland. No seasoning or flavor, just cut strips of potatoe with shredded cheese and bacon bits -- I could have made that at home. That's it. No salt. No chives. No pizzazz.  So, again,  0-3.   Then I try the cookie dessert.  The picture looked great but what I got wasn't all of that. The cookie was puffed up instead of flat like a normal cookie. It looked good but wasn't great. 0-4.   I did try the apple pie from a friend and that was good.   I won't eat at Cheddars again.",

As I passed the hostess on the way out she was staring off in to the distance, without any acknowledgement or farewell. Again at 520, the restaurant was nearly empty, the staff socializing as they performed side work. Can't use the excuse they were busy.   The burger and potato skin appetizer was very good, and the reason I didn't give a single star. If it weren't for the service I'd happily return. As it stands I will not.",

We are huge proponents of diversity and have no issue sitting with ANYONE ANYTIME.  basically we have never met a stranger.  I did however notice that we were escorted to the very farthest back corner of the restaurant.  We quickly noticed that we were seated next to a table of 7 and other another table of 4.  The interesting thing was ours and the other 2 tables comprised the only Caucasian folks in the place.  So basically we all got relegated to a corner.  I think if we are ever to heal as a society, these type if selective behaviors need to stop.  I think in our diverse culture, one has to look at a bigger picture.  I am choosing not to be victimized by it but instead bring it to the attention of management.  If we are not wanted here, we won't return.  Thanks for the clear signal.  I can't help but wonder, if our daughter, who is African American,  had been with us, would we have been seated differently?",

Not soul food by any means, but just more a more \"homey\"/comfort food feel. I have had an entree from almost every \"section\" of the menu at this point. The portions are always HUGE and the food always tastes good. Also, I think the prices are CHEAP! I am always surprised when the check comes how much food we've ordered and how cheap it is.   Salads come with a croissant that has a honey drizzle on them that is AMAZING. So delicious. You can also order 3 of them separately. I would highly recommend them.   The service here is usually pretty hit or miss. I've gone and had great service, but other times I've gone and had TERRIBLE service.",

We got the Santa Fe dip appetizer which was essentially watery spinach dip. I was starving and it didn't even taste good. I finally decided to get buffalo chicken tenders for lunch. The tenders were terrible which is hard to do. The salad was basically iceberg lettuce salad mix from a bag. The prices are really low but the quality is just as low. I couldn't be paid to go back!

Pretty unapologetic about it despite our attempts to laugh it off.   3) Ran out of  country-fried steak. Asked for another option adjusted to lunch size/price. Server got an attitude, said he would get manager. Manager said \"we are a scratch restaurant and our goal is to run out of food, so we really can't do anything about it.\"  4) (update) had the chicken and waffles. I very rarely if ever eat meat, so suspected my body was reacting when I became ill; however 24 hours later and I still have stomach cramping and pain, as does others in my party who had chicken and waffles. No one else in the party is ill, however. (6/13/14).  WHAT??? So, your GOAL is to DISAPPOINT???
