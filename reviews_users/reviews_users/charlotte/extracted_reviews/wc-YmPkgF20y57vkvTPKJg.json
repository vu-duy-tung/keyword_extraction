When the menu states a dish is spicy-  it is!!!!  My daughter and myself both ordered the two of the spiciest dishes on the menu.  They were delicious.  I had a Korean chicken stir fry.  It was about 1/2 the price of a dish at a Korean restaurant and it was just as good.  My husband ordered the lemongrass dish and it was very aromatic.  My son had the chicken fried rice-  tasty but it needed a bit more soy sauce.  Overall a very good experience and we would return for another visit.",

I loved the fact that the egg roll looked made in house and not the typical egg roll that's on most menus. That alone would bring me back. The Bangkok noodles had a nice flavor with just the right heat. Only issue for me would be that it's either over sauced or the sauce needs to be thinned out a bit. It was heavy and gloppy on the noodles so I ended up picking through it for the meat and veggies and leaving behind more than half the noodles. Most peanut sauces I've made or ordered were not that heavy",

So disappointed to be told after paying that they \"ran out\" of \"salad rolls\" before watching them give some to a woman in line after me. Had to settle for egg rolls. What a shame that they couldn't keep their very popular lettuce wraps in stock. Not only that, but they gave someone in line after me lettuce wraps that should've been mine. I'm never one to rag on a place or complain, but it was just so frustrating. What a disappointment it was. Also, the Mongolian Beef that I got tasted completely different from the Mongolian Beef that my friend got. Mine was straight up soy sauce and it was awful. At least I got to spend the day with good friends. Not to say that you shouldn't go, but I definitely would rather head over to PF Chang's where I can count on better service and reliable food.",

Food was overall bland and needed more sauce. Not recommended if you want good food, but if you like bland food and good service it's for you. Food is over priced for the cheap cuts of meat and low quality of the ingredients used. For such a simple dish, you'd think it would be better. If you want food with flavor, I would recommend Noodles and Company next door. They actually use steak!!!",

Me and my wife have had nothing but an all around great experience during each visit. I will be swinging in again real soon.",

The first person served was almost done their meal about the time the sixth person got theirs! The soda machine was missing half the choices and we were told someone was coming next Monday to replenish the tanks. The faucet in the ice tea container was dripping and the catch tray was full so it was leaking all over the counter and the floor. The food quality was not great, no fortune cookies, no soda cup lids, the floors were sticky! Won't be frequenting this restaurant again unless things improve dramatically!",

The orange chicken had a good flavor, but something was missing. It was tender, but needed something to make it pop. Maybe because it wasn't crispy could've been the difference between ehh and good!

I'd strongly recommend the lettuce wraps (as a meal) and I think the ginger broccoli shrimp is my new favorite indulgence. I'm bummed they took their Thai chicken lettuce wraps off the menu shortly after they opened (there used to be two different kinds, now there is one). While I'm a big fan of their food, I think their service could use some work. When eating in during lunch, it feels like it takes a while for the food to come out (which it's fresh when it does come out, but I'm limited when I can go for lunch due to the time constraints of my workday). So, this past week, I decided to order through their app for a designated pick-up time. They open at 11, so I selected 11:30 for my pick up. I then placed a second order for a coworker for 11:40 pickup.  I arrived at 11:30 and my food from my first order was not ready and neither were the lettuce wraps I had ordered second. I ended up not getting out of there until at least 11:50 which was disappointing considering I ordered in advance for a set pickup time (especially on the first order that I placed before they were even open).",

The crab rangoons are fashioned with real crab which I was not expecting. They were quite tasty. My husband had the steak dan dan noodles and they were lacking flavor. My friend had the honey severed chicken and it also lacked flavor. There was no sriacha or salt to be found... this deducted two stars for me. I hope yo find other dishes with the same flavor as he appetizers.",

After another 20 or so minutes, after he paid, he was told that they ran out of chicken (that was on both of our dishes) and that they could exchange it for shrimp or steak. At this point, it didn't even look like they had started on the dish, so we opted out and got a refund for our meal. Honestly the food here isn't bad, but just pretty ridiculous that they couldn't tell us they didn't have any chicken until he had already waited 20 minutes.",

I ordered the Thai soup to start and it was delicious but definitely smaller than what I expected. I also got the Korean Spicy Chkn, which was very good and I definitely recommend if you like spicy. The rice dishes have 3/4 rice and 1/4 chicken. But with the sauce, it mixes well. I got a small size and it was a perfect portion for me. My boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken and it was good as well. It had very nice flavors and he got the larger size. Definitely filling for him. The flavors of everything was good. Not too salty or too bland. I'd definitely come back. Especially for my free cookie  (take a survey online)",

The last three times I've eaten there, my sushi had already fallen apart when served, my crab wontons were burnt, and the rice bowl (1 mongolian beef, 2 sweet and sour chicken) were not up to usual par. The portions, for one, have seen a large decrease it seems. The rice has been dry all three times, and the s&s chicken was complete slop. Thick sauce to the point the breading was falling off. Mongolian beef was ok, but really tough where as it used to be a go to because it was tender and flavorful. I came back twice hoping I had just hit a few bad trips, but this last visit was just to use my rewards (free entree) that I accrued. Very disappointed as this used to by my favorite Asian fare.",

Between ordering a regular general tso, and a small orange chicken, I was pretty disappointed to get the exact same size dishes between the two. The rice choice we ordered with the orange chicken was brown but it was served with white rice. The pork egg rolls were burned and the box was full of grease. The vegetable lo mein was noodles swimming in soy sauce. The place it's self was pretty dirty. The floor was super sticky through the entire place. The stainless steel throughout was covered in handprints and in high places even. The drink station was covered in spilled liquids. The staff was 50/50 for friendliness. Some acknowledged you, including some of the cooks, and some didn't bother to acknowledge your presence at all. Overall, this wasn't a great experience and the food was sub par for the price.",

They have a menu up front to look at while standing in line, so hopefully you will have your mind made up when you get to the register.  You order, then take a pager, then they buzz you when it's ready.    I ordered a noodle dish and a 4 piece sushi appetizer.  The sushi was ok.  It wasn't bad, but tasted fast food-ish (if that's a thing).  I wouldn't order it again, just because it was sort of bland.  The noodle dish was also decent, but do not....I repeat DO NOT get the rice sticks in any of your dishes.  They are so disgusting.  They are supposed to be crispy and give an extra crunch, but they are stale and soggy.  So gross!  Overall....it's quick...it's cheap, but just not somewhere I would consistently pick.",

How do you serve this kind of food They did offer me a refund or to remake the dish but at that point I probably already eaten raw chicken! I will give a lot of credit to the owner of this business he responded with in 24 hours excepted responsibility and wanted to look into the matter right Away thank you to the owner for looking into this ASAP I'm going to delete the review so as not to damage the business because he responded so quickly it's obvious he cares about his customers and the food and this was clearly an isolated incident",

It has gotten to be a problem. Part of it is because I don't feel guilty about eating the lettuce wraps because...NO CARBS! I have had both but the original has more flavor, the Thai is a little more spicy. I've also had the Kung Pao Shrimp rolls...OMG, so incredible. I've also tried the ahi tuna rolls, I don't like them nearly as much as the kung pao.   They are a bit pricey so I don't know how much longer I'll be able to keep this up.  Update: Didn't I say this place would be a problem for me...I decided to look up nutritional information for the lettuce wraps today (insert face palm emoji HERE!) They have from 40-70 grams of carbs! And I've been inhaling them. And I wondered how I had gained two pounds at my weigh-in with my trainer. Help me, Lawd :'(",

My complaint is how absolutely filthy the place was. The floors in the dining room were so sticky my shoes stuck to them in a serious way. The stickiness continued into the ladies room where it got even worse. The floors were absolutely black with gunk that had been there a long time. These floors didn't get this way on one busy holiday. When was the last time they were cleaned and degreased?  It breaks my heart to see a place I like so much, be so neglected by it's management. It doesn't matter how good the food and the service are at any establishment; if the place is dirty, I can't eat there. Please do a deep clean and I will be back and give a better review.",

I literally tried this place twice in one week just make sure my review would be great (lol I love food and was just wanted to try another menu item since I couldn't make up my mind the first time, but let's stick to it being about the review).   You have a bright menu to look over when you first walk in as well as menu in front of the cashier where you can go over the details of different items (don't take too long though). The first visit led me to try the Mongolian rice bowl and once I ordered, the cashier handed me a pager that would vibrate once my meal was ready in the pick up area. The second visit led me to try the sesame rice bowl, but I ate it before snapping a picture. Both meals were about $9 for a regular size serving.   If you open up your to-go dish or look at your plate and think you've been shorted...you haven't. The meat and saucy goodness is under the rice, so just mix it all together!   The service was...meh, but I also went when it was busy. By all means don't take my word for it... go check them out!",

They had 4-5 tables near the window blocked off with \"wet floor signs\" and taped \"reserved\" onto them??? A word of advice to management: if you have a mouse problem, I don't think it would've hurt the business to close temporarily for an hour or two while you try to get the problem under control. That would have potentially saved your reputation by not having two reviews that say \"MOUSE\" on them... Hope that problem is fixed for future customers, but I sure will not be returning!",

The restaurant is spacious, clean, and modern.  The service was great, from the ordering to the delivery of the food to the multiple table side visits to make sure we had everything we needed.  Now on to the food...  I ordered a kid's sweet & sour chicken with brown rice and apple juice for my toddler. I loved that the sauced items were placed in the bottom of the bowl, the rice on top, and the veggies were steamed and not tossed in sauce.   I ordered the spicy Polynesian poke bowl, the current special. I didn't love it but I also didn't hate it. It was okay but I'm also a bit poke bowl snob so my standard is a bit high.   We'll definitely be back and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!",

I was with my two young boys and he got a highchair ready for me and was just beyond helpful.  The food was a little dry, could have used a more seasoning.  By far, the customer service was the best though, I will always remember Melvin, such a sweetheart!",

Sadly, for this location, the latter held True. Everything was bland, cut unevenly, and dripping in sauce. In a center with many food options, their quality just doesn't warrant me returning.   I went for a bento box, which is great, because you get a little bit of everything you love - an appetizer, sushi, salad and an entree - but all in manageable portions. I went for the ginger chicken with cauliflower rice, salad, potstickers and the wasabi crunch roll. I'll start by saying the mini potstickers were amazing. They had great flavor, crunch, and a small drizzle of sauce to tie it all together. My wasabi crunch roll was very unevenly cut and the wasabi peas on the roll were definitely stale and soft. My salad was dripping in dressing, and the dressing itself was overly salty. As for my ginger chicken, the pieces were all uneven, and one was rock hard, which was an absolute turn off.   What was a lunch I was looking forward to ended up being a big disappointment.",

I just don't see myself giving them more chances to make me wish I went somewhere else.   Also, they may be trying to kill their customers with the slippery mats by the drink area.  Every time it's wet and dangerous.   Save yourself from a broken heart and pelvis - skip this location.",

We walked across the street to this Location .. it looked empty outside. And we were hungry and sweaty. They had an outside sitting area.   So when we got inside it was pretty empty. Only a lady sitting alone. And a couple, whom looked upset.    We went and looked and ordered a bento box (I believe their called) because it looked like the easiest and you got to custom make it.   My son got the chicken teriyaki with rice He choose the crunchy sushi. And he got the meat pot sticks and the salad which we asked no tomatoes. ( if course it came with tomatoes when it arrived)   I got the shrimp with cauliflower rice. I asked for the California sushi and for the Crab ragon. And the veggie side. Which everything was cold.     Except the sushi. They had run out and had to replace it with an spring roll which had huge mushroom strips.   They request it to add the spring roll for me bc they ran out .. but the mixed it up and replaced his crunchy sushi too .. so we didn't get to try none of the sushi.   Over all. We paid 23 bucks for food that wasn't even warm anymore. But it was a cute set up.",

I waited for approximately 15 minutes before the server took my order.  Each time I visited this location I had to wipe the table off. The eating area, including the drinking area is always dirty/uncleaned. My order comes up quick but the food is bland. My steak was overcooked.  I guess I am comparing this location to the Ballantyne location and there is a major difference in the services, cleanliness and the taste of the food. I'm only writing this review because I want them to do better and I want to like this restaurant.",

I would have given rating higher if I could have subbed out the non-vegan stuff for a spring roll or some broccoli but cashier was clueless. At he end of the visit nothing was impressive or exceptional. Short note that I was a little puzzled that the sriracha was up high out of customer reach as apparently used for decoration?!

Also the sushi was more rice than anything else.   I ordered carry-out, but liked the style of the restaurant when I picked up. My mother had steak + shrimp ramen and ordered extra shrimp for it. I'll just say I guess that if she had not ordered \"extra\" then she would not have had any shrimp at all or just 1-2... However, she REALLY liked it and is looking forward to going again. Sooo I guess that would be the circumstance that I would visit here again...",

The picture above doesn't justify how horrible this food was. This is supposed to be \"sweet and sour chicken, with fried rice\". To start, the \"fried rice\" was extremely dry, and mushy. The chicken was also dry, and pretty much had no sweet and sour sauce. The snap peas were cold, and basically raw(no big deal, they're snap peas) BUT the rest of the dish was HOT. In addition, not shown in the picture was what I ordered, and it was honestly just as bad if not worse. Very disappointing! My Fiance is pregnant, so eating at Pei Wei is pretty much ruined.",

    "text": "The food looks nice and authentic. I ordered to make sure I had something kosher. The other person obviously had what they wanted and it all looks great! The Japanese Steak & Shrimp Chile Ramen. Then the Chicken Chow Mein is Hot and fresh. I just love the fact that it's not fried in grease like so many other places. We know that it is supposed to be a franchise but of course we'll see how long this one hangs around. As long as they keep on the menu what they have I think they should stay around for quite a while. I'm still not convinced about purchasing the Cauliflower bowl just yet. I know how to make my own so we'll see.",
