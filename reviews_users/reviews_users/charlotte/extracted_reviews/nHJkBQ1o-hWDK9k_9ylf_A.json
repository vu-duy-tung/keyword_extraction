Had to ask for a wet hand wipe to sign my debit receipt! Tough barbecue. Reheated? The barbecue was hot, but tough. But while they were tough and hot, the fries were stale and cold! Soggy corn bread. $11.90.  A mess. Denny's is right next door. Chili's across from that. Even McDonalds might be a better choice. It's across the street. Maybe try that. Seemed like Sonny's was leftovers from another plate, tossed into a used container and thrown at me. And I paid for that. I felt underwhelmed and upset. Customer service was kind. The young lady taking the order both on phone, and in person, was very sweet. But the food was subpar.",

    "text": "This Sonny's location has been recently refurbished, which looks better than it did before; though it is one of the smaller locations for this chain restaurant.  I do visit this Sonny's more often because of its proximity to I-77 (when driving by) and/or it's location in front of Costco, when I shop there; so I guess I'm somewhat of a regular.  On my last visit, I ordered the Pork 3-Way plate with fries, coleslaw, and sweet tea.  The order went fast, with food already on table within' five minutes.  The coleslaw was as expected: sweet, slightly creamy with a good crunch to it.  The fries were okay I guess, though a few were soft.  The pulled pork was very good, I drizzled it with sizzilin' sweet sauce on top and ate it with the garlic bread.  The sliced pork (which I asked to be chopped) was good too.  The ribs (dry rubbed) were probably the weakest on the plate, the underneath part of the rib was nothing but fat and was easy to scrap off by a knife; were kind of dry but not bad.  Overall, it was a good meal.  The waitress came by the table often to refill my drink without asking; overall good service.  Now is this the best barbeque around, no... but it's not bad either.  Sonny's is one of the better barbeque chain restaurants in the southeast and this location is one of its better locations, and that is how I am rating it.",

I got a \"rack\" of ribs...spare ribs.  Just because they are not baby backs, it doesn't mean that they can't be tender people.  I don't understand how a pit smoked rib can be so tough and hard to get off the bone.  Its \"Fall off the bone\" and \"Stick to your ribs\" not \"Stick to the bone\"  The salad bar was the very definition of nothing special.  I don't think I will be craving the food anytime soon.   What saved it was the service.  The kitchen screwed up our order and we had a large party but our server handled it very well.  I could tell that she had a long shift already but she was bright and cheerful towards us.  She covered the mistakes well and offered great service and was right on the spot with refills.    Don't think I'll be back, unless Jim N Nicks and Macs Speed Shop burns down...together",

The ribs were cooked to perfection but the rub lacked flavor. I had the homemade beans and  Mac and cheese, both were delicious! My daughter had the wet ribs and only shared a single bite (don't blame her a bit). They were also done to perfection and the sauce had more flavor. Wife had the pulled pork and was impressed. She grew up near Lexington, NC so she knows her BBQ. I was also allowed only a single bite and was also very impressed. They offer several sauces at the table and each had a very unique flavor. Service was good, glassed stayed full and bill came at the correct time. I found that the amt was kinda high for all lunch entree's when 2 of the meals were kids meals. The total without tip was $48.00. Worth a try and I will return when in the area.",

The place was clean and priced reasonably ($37 for 3adult--2 of that was lunch sized, 1 dinner sized, and 1 kids meal) the portion sizes were good.   Mac n cheese -- awesome, it consisted of real cheese and the blue boxed stuff  Cornbread -- very, very good! I'm pretty sure there was some pig fat or grease baked into it!   Catfish-- was baked and completely covered with breadcrumbs. I was under the assumption that it was a baked on topping, something 'lighter'. It did taste good though.  Water--was totally okay! I even had a lemon wedge in mine :)  Beef brisket-- juicy, very good according to mom  Roasted chicken(forgot the name) --- was alright, certainly nothing to brag about  It's definitely not what expected for 'real' southern cooking, but I'd go back because it's cheap and more than edible. Oh and also for the cornbread!",

My name is Beth F. and I have a problem... but they say the first step to fixing that problem is to admit it right?? Well forget that, I don't want to help this problem!! I think I could literally drink Sonny's sweet bbq sauce.  It is so freaking amazing I think we could start a world peace movement with that sweet creamy deliciousness. I would say to give me a few buckets of it, to start the movement, but I think my will power would cave and I'd end up consuming it all before I could even get it to the places it needed to go.  The service at this location has always been fantastic and fast, and my God, it goes without saying that their bbq is the best I've ever had. My only complaint about Sonny's is that it's not walking distance to my house. We had one nearby that closed I guess, and so I'm just bummed and it's making me whiney. :P  They have a salad bar, but let's be honest... who eats the salad bar when the BBQ plates are so filling... NOM... If you're hungry NOW, and want something that you will most likely have leftovers from, this is your place.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a good place to get cheap, tasty barbeque, Sonny's is really decent option.  If you're in the mood to try their different meats, the Super Combo is really the way to go.  For around $14, you can get their brisket, pork, chicken and ribs.  The brisket was really just so-so (about 2.5/5), the pulled pork was pretty good (3.5/5), but the ribs (very meaty and tender) and chicken (moist and smoky) were really good (4/5).  I also tried some of the sliced pork, which was really good too - I recommend that over the pulled pork.  If you're in the mood to pig out, they had some decently cheap all-you-can-eat (AYCE) specials.  You can even get AYCE ribs for less than $20. They offer discounts on the AYCE depending on what night you go there (I think Tuesdays they discount the ribs).  Their side items aren't bad either.  I love that offer corn on the cob as a side, and the corn wasn't too bad (although it was a little more mushy, like frozen corn on the cob).  Their macaroni and cheese is ok - very cheesy!  Truly, though, their cornbread is where it's at!  It is tender, moist, and mildly sweet - so delish!  If you're in the mood for a salad, they offer a decent salad bar here as well.  Our waiter was really friendly and helpful, and all the staff working there was really nice to us.  Our food came out super fast, which is always fabulous.  The decor was pretty typical for a chain restaurant.  They also offer a drive thru when you come to pick up carry-out, which is probably very helpful if you're wanting food on-the-go.  Cheap prices and several good food options are good reasons to visit a restaurant again.",

    "text": "Very good and consistent barbecue! I've had the dry rub ribs why were meaty and flavorful. I've also had the smoked turkey and brisket sandwiches which were both great- authentic, tasty, with a nice smokey flavor to them. The meat is the best here and one of my favorite bbq places in town.   As for sides, they are a bit disappointing.  The cornbread is ok, I don't like the corn pieces in it really. The fries kind of a look like cheap looking store bought crinkle cut fries and they are always soggy and limp as a take out order.   I have also been to the Mooresville branch which is consistent too. So depending on which part of the city you live in, you can plan accordingly.   TIP: If you go through the drive thru expect to wait longer than a fast food drive thru. The attendant who serves me at this location always smiles and is pleasant.",

    "text": "I hate to write a review like this in that I know the Owner's and his Dad. As a child I was able to meet them and grew up knowing Sonny.  This location was kind of busy. Went in the door and waited for a while before one of the 20 people who worked there stopped goofing around and actually acknowledged the two groups and me and my son who had come in. Clearly this should have been an indicator of what was next.  We were seated in a dirty booth and the family next to us looked very unhappy. It took about 15 minutes for anyone to come to the table. She took our drink order and left. In the mean time she delivered cold food to the family next to us that looked unhappy.  about 10 more minutes and the people behind us who had come in with us finally met their server who was more than confused. We still had not gotten any drinks and not placed an order. The waitress came back to the table and asked about our drink order again. I gave her five minutes. When she came back and had nothing I gave up.   I grabbed the manager on the way out and he looked like a deer in the headlights. He knew he had issues, bad people and a huge problem. He was working in the kitchen when they got him and when a manager is in the kitchen it's bad news.  While the front of the house was a wreck his employees where goofing off, wandering around and most of them not doing anything to help the others out. This was clearly a case of bad hiring and could be fixed but that was a pure waste of 30 - 40 minutes.",

The ribs I ordered were the sweet and smokey ones, and I was surprised, because they were a little dry on the outside. A squirt of some hot BBQ sauce however brought them to life! While not perfect, I think they came through as a solid representation of Carolina ribs. I'd  come again and next time I'll order the baby back ribs which I gather are super tender. The sweet tea is good here as well. However the True breakout star was to my surprise, the mac and cheese! Slightly browned on top, al dente pasta, extremely cheesy without being salty and just perfection. I'd put it up against home made, it was that good.",

I ordered the brisket with the sweet rub ribs with Cole slaw and baked beans. I don't eat cole slaw, so I gave it to my boyfriend. I didn't really like the beans. They tasted like ketchup, but my boyfriend who is from the south said they had the southern kick to them. Our server, who was from Maryland also said the same thing. He said up north, we're used to a sweeter sauce for the beans, so maybe it was just me. The ribs were delicious and tender. The salad bar was excellent, but I wish they had romaine lettuce rather than iceberg, so I opted to make myself a spinach salad. The brisket was fall apart tender was well and the sweet tea was just how I liked it, sweet and ice cold. We also ordered the redneck egg rolls appetizer, but everything came out at once, even our salad bar plates. I liked the sweet bbq sauce that was on the table and I didn't care for the smoky sauce at all.",

Might be wrong on the name there but is was brisket inside a fried roll cut at an angle. It was amazing.  The sweet tea was good, but I could pass on it after the first glass. Not bad, just not achingly sweet like I prefer. That way the ice doesn't dilute it as much.  All in all I would eat there again. Wait staff was friendly and my server was very nice.",

Their all-you-can-eat pork special is partly responsible for me being a big fat fatty.  Some days are better than others for the fare, but the service has always been top notch.  Folks here have always been friendly and helpful.  I recently discovered their Redneck Egg Rolls.  An egg roll stuffed with pork, slaw and cheese, served with a smoky ranch.  Yes, please. Delicious.  Seriously.  The egg roll is mostly meat, which hardly ever happens.  And MUCH better than the similar item that I had at a snootier hipster place in Charlotte.  The corn nuggets have a description that makes them sound a bit iffy, but I enjoy those as well - they're different and satisfy a salty sweet craving, if you have one.    The garlic bread is good, and the corn bread is flavored well, though a bit crumbly and messy.  Mac and cheese is fine, green beans are flavored with pork (the way Jeebus intended them to be), fries are crinkle cut and standard, slaw is yummy.  I really haven't had any of the sides that I hated, but none are OHMYDOG delicious.  And for the meat.. oh, the meat... all of us girls want good meat.  It's fine.  It's not going to be the best BBQ that you have ever had.  It's good enough.  Served as ordered, in relatively good portions.    The bonus for this location is their drive thru.  You can pull up and order something easy for a quick wait, or you can call ahead for a takeout and pick it up at the drive thru.",

    "text": "My family and I just ate at this establishment on 06/13/19 @ 12:30pm. We were warmly greeted and then it took a turn. We were seated and ordered our food. When we received our food, it was $50 worth of food that should have been half that due to the portion and quality. My daughter ordered the lunch ribs with tater tots and fries. The ribs (3 ribs) were overly dry and at the same time they were mushy in spots and had no meat on them. She did not eat them. The tater tots we're good but the fries were plain and bland. She had to soak them in sauce to eat them. She also got a salad bar. She said it was the most disgusting thing she has eaten and she loves salad. It didn't taste \"clean\". The Watergate salad looked like it was mixed with glue, bitter cucumbers, not much options for salad bar. It was very limited Vegetables, which is the reason she wanted salad. The ranch dressing was so watery that it went right through the salad to the bottom of the plate and disappeared. Yet somehow the ranch they served with the food was thick, like it came from a completely different batch of ranch. I ordered the wings with salad bar. I agree with all of the above about the salad but would like to add that there was a container up there that looked like it at one time had tuna salad in it but it was now dry and crusted to the bottom of the container, which made me almost throw up. I ate one wing and decided to take the rest home and try to bake them in the oven a bit longer as they were very soggy and saturated with sauce. The sauce is tasty but the food needs a great deal of work. My husband got the pulled pork lunch plate. He said that his was acceptable but the portions were small and could have been seasoned better due to the lack of flavor. The waitress started out very friendly. She later was much more attentive to the tables around us. We got one refill for drink and that was when we were getting ready to leave. I feel like this would be an ideal restaurant for people who enjoy places like Golden corral and Waffle House or for college kids that need hangover food.",

I got a generous portion of pulled pork with fries, two big pieces of garlic bread and coleslaw for $6.99. Again, this was a daily special. I also got a sweet tea. Boy was it sweet! The pulled pork was so moist, tender and delicious! I also enjoyed the different types of BBQ sauces they offered. They even had little to-go packs of various types of sauces. Awesome! The ladies who assisted us were fantastic! I love receiving southern hospitality :) Way to go Sonny's! I'll be back :)",

Server arrived at out table five minutes later. No good, but again, not a big deal. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. Twenty minutes later, no drinks. Iced Tea and Coke, not a complicated order. Food order was sliced port plate and pork sandwich, again not a complicated order. While we twiddled our thumbs all the people who arrived after us got drinks and food. When drinks arrived server said our food was coming out. 15 minutes later, no food. Hubby and I walked out. No one stopped us and asked for payment for our drinks. Our server waved her hand and said \"bye\".  This Sonny's gets mostly groups of business men at lunch from local car dealership, etc. Hubby and I were the only couple in the restaurant. I was the only woman customer in the restaurant. We are older and we don't wear fancy clothes. I believe our server didn't think we would be good tippers so she ignored us.  Shame on you server. I am a retired chef and I am the best tipper you would ever have. Don't judge me by my age or gender.  Never going back to this Sonny's.",

Now over the years I've had better but Sonny's was always good. It was good tonight also. I think. Portion size was a joke. My brother had ribs, 5 small riblets I'd say. My sister-in-law had half a small chicken. And I had the brisket. If I'm going to pay what they charge I want more then what may have been less then a 1/4 lb. Really?  I understand  costs and profit. There are many other places I can get good BBQ for similar cost and fill full walking out. They 3stars because it tasted good, still. I think.",

We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in because the hostess happily and genuinely enthusiastically greeted us. However, when she tried to seat us at 5:52 a server in the empty section she was trying to seat us in curtly informed her she was not on until 6:00. After a little backtracking and scrambling the polite hostess was able to find a seat for us.   The boyfriend ordered the Sonny's Sampler and I ordered the brisket and then we waited, and waited. We watched as other people (who arrived after us) received their food and then waited some more. When our food finally arrived it was a disappointment. My brisket was completely dry, as was the cornbread. I tried everything on the sample platter and again everything was exceedingly dry, except for the ribs. The ribs were actually great and we might return to have them for the all you can eat special. However we tried a variety of options and the ribs were the only tasty bit of the meal.   The price was fair, the establishment was clean and some of the sauces were tasty but we wouldn't return for anything except to try the ribs again.",

    "text": "So I need to ask you something, Charlotte Yelpers.    Forgive me because I am from out of town, and I respect you all.  But I know how serious you all take your barbecue.  During my recent trip there, I had co-workers who took me to Mac's Speed Shop for what they told me was authentic Carolina barbecue.  I loved it.  I noticed that Mac's has 3 1/2 stars currently on Yelp, same as this place.    Charllotte Yelpers, how can you tell me that this place is anywhere near as good as Mac's?    You see, I had one day to myself to get lunch.  I decided to trust the Yelp app to find me another barbecue place.  I saw this place was near me, and having never heard of it before being from Philadelphia, I assumed this would be another authentic place.  And even though it had less reviews, I thought since it had the same level of stars as Mac's, I'd get some good barbecue that was at least as close as what they serve there.   It was about 5 minutes into sitting down here when I realized that I was sitting in the south's version of Famous Dave's.    Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the combo that I had.  It wasn't bad at all.  But come on.  If you want authentic barbecue, you don't come here.  I felt slightly let down.    Now that I've had my \"What the hell are you thinking Charlotte\" rant, I'll say that for a chain restaurant, the food was pretty tasty, the service was very good, and I'd eat here again if I ever had the chance.  Both the pulled pork and the chicken were decent if not spectacular.   Well, maybe I won't eat here again if I'm in the area with Mac's not too far away.  But it was good enough if not the greatest.",

There was one listed as hot (or something along those lines - don't quite remember), but it did not taste as hot as the other one labeled some sort of less hot than that one (Geez, I hope that sentence made sense.) The supposedly hotter one, just had a taped on lablel saying that it was hotter. Quite peculiar, but both sauce options were still good nonetheless.  The service was a little slower than my liking, but I'm not completely upset about that. The server was friendly to us.",

I appreciated how aware the staff was on the GF options and the manager came over and told me they would remove gloves to prepare my meal. That on its own gets 5 stars!!! That many places are willing to do that.  I ordered Baby Back Ribs, corn on the cob and a sweet potato. Their BBQ sauce is GF and the corn and potato wrapped on foil with no chance of contamination.   The meat fell of the bones. Very well prepared. I keeping one star because I needed more flavor on all items.  There was just that hint of something missing.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.",

That said, we found that the ribs were quite overdone this time. Difficult to chew, far from \"fall off the bone\" and in the end, not that great. With it, the quart of cole slaw was packed well, a little bit crunchy but we found it to be overly sweet. Are they putting a sweetener in the cole slaw?  I've had good meals at Sonny's but I will avoid the ribs going forward.  An update to my 8th review of all time, more than ten years ago!  [Review 11126 overall, round number 900 of 2019.]",

Mac and cheese with corn on the job and juice box- she said she liked the mac and cheese but she really did not eat it. The corn on the cob was so much fun!   Ice cream- ordered vanilla ice cream and Sharon turned it in to a Sunday with chocolate syrup and a cherry!   Sonny appeared to be family friendly and took great care of my children.

She also told me I could try other items than just the ribs , and I could try other sides.   Since I'd never been here I tried a couple different items.

Also the food that did come out... came out cold as if they had just opened up a can of beans and put some barbecue sauce on it. The NC State Health Department should come and conduct an inspection because I'm sure this facility will be shut down. The cole slaw was spoiled and rotten to the core and The one bite that I did taste... I'm sure I have food poison and will have diarrhea!!!

Waitress asked me what kind of sauce I wanted and I said regular bbq. (She puts in 2 mustard sauce packets and no regular or anything else's).   After I ordered I sat at the little bar area waiting for my food to be ready. I over heard one waitress telling another that the tip from the previous table was only $7 and that she hopes they don't come back again. To give the benefit of the doubt I don't know how big the group was but by the looks of the place it couldn't have been more than a couple people. Place was empty. What kind of training are they receiving where they don't want customers to go back?? I certainly won't- but not because of what I heard.   I get home and sit down to eat my food and start with my cold Mac and cheese, it was like they took it right out of the refrigerator and put it in a to go container. I take one bite of my sweet Carolina and start chewing it and I am able to choke it down. Not good. Second bite I start chewing it and immediately have to run to my bathroom and get sick. Just disgusting food.   Please do not patronize this establishment- go get real bbq from a real restaurant.",

It was incredibly dirty and almost everything in the salad bar was decimated. The sneeze guard needed a serious cleaning and I think the floor hadn't been swept in a week. The men's restroom was the type of restroom that you wanna get in and get out of as fast as possible without even touching the faucets. The specials menu offers your choice of ribs with two sides for $9.99 and I chose the baby back. The meat wasn't plentiful but it did fall off of the bone. Also, I would recommend the baked beans as a side. They were pretty good with chunks of pork mixed in and a decent sauce. I would say the beans stopped me from having a 1 star experience. As a side note, I did get a stomach ache within 30 mins of leaving this place but maybe it was just a coincidence. Good luck !",

Well we were seated by a waitress since the hostess wasn't at her post and given a booster seat for our child by the waitress. I guess this was some stupid punishment since she thought we seated ourselves. Who knows. The waitress who sat us ended up serving us. Even crazier to me that she sat us and took forever to come and serve us. She FINALLY came and took our order. We asked for a kids cup of water that we never got. We got our food and the brisket was cold and tough. Everyone has focused on this large party. I didn't say anything because the waitress took too long to come back and check on us so I ate it . Couldn't cut it with a knife do I had to eat it with my hands. We never got a drink refill. Halfway through the meal she asked if we wanted desert. We still had food to eat! Clearly she was ready for us to go so she could get back to helping the large party. Two stars because the okra, sweet potato and cold slaw were good.  Never coming back though.

The green beans tasted like the tin can they came out of. The salad bar needed to be picked through just to find the good lettuce, skip the tomatoes, no black olives and the strawberry whipped salad was more like glue then whipped cream. The one good thing was the wait staff who were genuine and charming. Sorry I stopped in.",

The place was pretty empty when we got there, so that kinda made we wonder......., but we really were not there at prime time.  I ordered a sweet tea & the \"Whole Hog\" sandwich. That sandwich is Sliced Pork, Pulled Pork and Jalapeno Cheddar Hot Links topped with Sweet BBQ Sauce on a bun. Everything I had was on point. The sandwich was great....... so good I thought about ordering another one to go. The sweet tea had the waitress filling my glass 3 or 4 times.   Sonny's is a chain, but the food was great. The wait staff was average, no complaints. The food is the star, the way it should be.",

I pulled up and waited. And waited. Finally the window opened, she took my money and closed the door. And I waited, 7 minutes went by. No one came to the window to ask for patience. I then honked my horn. Nothing. 9 minutes later the window opened, she handed me my food and closed the window. No customer service. Glad I don't own that place!!! When I got to my office and opened my sandwich, I wished I had gone to Arbys. Their brisket sandwich has stuff on it...onion straws, sauce. Sonny's has nothing on it and barely a full layer of meat to cover the bun. Come on Sonny's! You can do better!!!",

    "text": "I love some BBQ, but Sonny's just doesn't cut it for me. First of all, this place is a franchise so that's automatically blasphemy in the BBQ world. I love some hometown BBQ & going into a place a franchised BBQ place just isn't on my list of favorite things to do.  Their BBQ is good & you can order family style, so everything here is not so bad. But there are plenty of other better, hometown BBQ joints close by in Charlotte. Sonny's doesn't have anything that's spectacular, but you'll leave full & satisfied.  But for my money, I'd rather get some better BBQ, at a better price, from a hometown place. If you don't mind the franchise feel added into your BBQ eating experience, then you won't mind heading to Sonny's to get filled up. But for me, you'll enjoy your BBQ much better from a local place with local recipes.",

    "text": "True, Sonny's is a chain and that hurts its standing as a BBQ joint. Still though, the food is pretty good.   It's pretty easy to call in takeout or order once you're there. There is a separate takeout area you go to in the restaurant. My friend and I only had to wait a few minutes for our food. I ordered BBQ chicken and she got pulled pork. Both meals - complete with two sides and cornbread - were so large that they fed us for days.   Here's a tip: The best Carolina BBQ can be found at church luncheons. Charlotte churches often have small festivals where you can get a plate of pulled pork, beans, slaw, etc., for $8 or $10. Try to save room if you can. They'll also be selling sweet potato pie and other Southern desserts.",

    "text": "I was in a time-crunch and starving and chose this Sonny's over some nearby chain restaurants. I'd been to a Sonny's a couple years back on a visit to Florida (when I was living in NY) and thought it was decent reasonably priced BBQ. Now that I live in NC and frequently travel to the BBQ capitols of the world (TX, TN, SC, NC) I know what the best BBQ should be. In fact, just a week before I'd had some of the best BBQ I'd ever eaten on a visit to Fort Worth. By comparison, the grub at this place was not nearly as good as what I'd remembered it to be. My chicken was bone dry, the ribs were small and dry, and the pulled pork was ok but unremarkable. That said, my server was friendly, the cost was low, the food came fast, and there was a decent amount of food for the price. I probably won't return to a Sonny's again unless I'm in a similar jam to this past time.",

It certainly lived up to the hype.  It's hard to say if it's the best I've had, because every good barbecue place is good in different ways, but  it's up there, especially for a chain.   If anyone from Sonny's reads this, come open a spot in Richmond.",

I had the super combo which has  sliced Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Ribs.  The pork was moist and tender, but could have been cooked a little longer.  The beef was pretty good as well, tender and moist.  The chicken was good with a smoky flavor.  The ribs were OK too, tender and coming off the bone cleanly.  My dinner came out with Texas toast and I asked the waitress for cornbread instead which she brought to me promptly.  The atmosphere was OK and the service was great.  As far as Sonny's being a chain, well that is not a sin in my book as long as the food is OK.  Sonny's serves solid, but not inspired, BBQ.  Will I be back, probably not since there are plenty of other BBQ places to try.",
