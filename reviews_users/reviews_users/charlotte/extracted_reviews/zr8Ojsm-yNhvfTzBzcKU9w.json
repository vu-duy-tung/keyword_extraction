The jalapeno cream is something you should add to every crepe you are eating!",

The service is pretty quick and the food is nice and hot. I've tried three different crepes there and every single one of them has been top notch. The pricing is also pretty decent relative to other crepe places around town. The food is incredible, but the only criticism I have is that the staff at the check out could have been a little more friendly.",

One thing to note for new comers, the creperie is located inside of an indoor market of sorts. There are a couple of different food counters along with a farmer's market and wine store. A very cool environment to pair with the awesome food.",

We tried the Curry Crepe (spicy version) which a had a perfectly balanced taste that I would try again! And again! We also had the Berry Cinn crepe which was our sweet crepe. The cinnamon and the strawberries set this one apart from their banana and hazelnut crepe adding quite a bit more flavor. We LOVED this place and its location because it had all of these little market shops around it, which we walked around and shopped at after eating. Also had coffee from Not Just Coffee.  This place is great for families, friends, dates, and exploring the city. It's somewhat pricey ($7.99 for a crepe) but they're big and quite filling and well worth the price. We can't wait to come back!",

Do yourself a favor and get the spicy curry chicken. If you're in more of a breakfast mood, the maple or mariachi crepes would be a great fit.   The only downsides are the seating situation on the weekends. Usually if all of the tables are taken in the market, Tanks Tap(?) usually has spots and they typically don't mind sharing space.",

I noticed that this shop is not nearly as busy as other ones (during weekday lunchtime rush). I'm not sure why. I can only guess that either the wait is a bit long (it takes awhile for them to make the crepes) and/or it is a bit overpriced. I don't mind paying close to $10 for the Basil Pesto Chicken since it is a filling meal, but for the ones with more simple ingredients, I personally think it's too much. For example, a crepe with Banana and Nutella is $6.75. Also, to create your own crepe, the thin crepe itself has a base charge of $4.75!  Again, the savory crepes are quite tasty, so I would probably return every now and then for those.",

The market is ideal for getting the best of everything from various other businesses and finding a table can be a challenge.

Their Crepes have just the right texture and the selection is straight forward, delicious and seriously addicting.

This is a counter service restaurant that is great for when you want something fast and delicious without having to deal with any of the fuss of a full service place so dont expect anything too fancy but the staff was super friendly and the food is really good. After you order you get a pager that will buzz when your food is ready...so the process was really smooth and  efficient.

They don't rush you to make an order. They will even help you make a decision (there are many choices).   I suggest getting coffee with your crepe from the coffee stand next to the creperie stand. I got the veggie savory crepe with is fantastic. I would highly recommend the nutella with strawberry and banana crepe.   The best part about this location is that you can take the metro rail right to its front door! Very convenient for a morning run uptown. The atmosphere is very hipster inside the market and you can find some great items for different dietary restrictions.",

I love the 7th Street Market anyway, so while taking some guests around Charlotte, we thought this would be ideal so everyone could get what they want. When I walked past Hazelnuts, I glanced at their menu...the s'mores a la mode stopped me right in my tracks. I'll take one please!  Pretty quick made-to-order. I walked back to the table, plate in hand, and a grin from ear to ear. The marshmallows made for an ooey-gooey delicious bite. The nutella and ice cream with a drizzle of caramel was made this a True dessert.",

We ordered three crepes, the Santorini, the Samosa and Banana Berry one. It took over 45 minutes to get our food. When we inquired with the team to confirm if our food was still in queue, we got the most disgusting response from one of the team members. I understand they might have been busy but their response was completely inappropriate. Not only her words but they way she \"clapped\" her hands to enforce her authority when giving her response was astounding. At the end we finally got the food and it was very mediocre. Nothing impressive, and I will not be revisiting. The staff is poorly trained in customer service.  They also had many wrong ordered produced that they had to redo, which is probably due to the lack of care the team showed. I noticed them opening and peeking at a lot of crepes to try to recall what was what. They definitely need to utilize a more productive way of doing things.",

We have a creperie in my hometown, so I figured this would be something familiar.  My face was turned up in knots as I watched the cook pick up topping and wipe her gloved hand on her pants each time she did. And not only once--we're talking about multiple times here!  Her pants were very heavily stained from the times she's done it before throughout the day. Not to mention not even trying to change gloves between the times of touching the order machine and the food.  It was nauseating!  The cook saw my turned up face and said \"What's wrong?\"  I couldn't even say because I didn't want her to do anything else to my food and I had already paid $9 bucks for it. I will never eat here again.  You can bet on that.",

    "text": "Was here last night at the 7th Street Public Market. Why would you not stop for a Crepe? We were at a Crepe frenzy.  The Basil Pesto Chicken Crepe- Fresh and oozing with cheese. Eat it while it's hot for it does not taste the same when it's cooled down. Portion enough to share with a friend or family member.  Talk about the Curry Chicken Crepe- Even though we ordered mild it was a tad spicy thank goodness with the sweet blend of Mango Chutney it was \"Spicy-Tangy\" and right up my alley.    Definitely, died and gone to heaven with the Create your own Crepe. Add your own desired toppings. This is what we added- Nutella, Banana, Graham Cracker, Whipped Cream with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream, who can ask for anything more.  Staff was friendly and helpful with selecting crepes- there were tons to choose from. They provided you with a vibrating pager to let you know when your crepe is ready. How cool is that! Can continue to shop and walk around the market without any distractions.",

    "text": "Two words: mixed emotions. That's how I feel about this place.   My crepe (the very veggie curry) was delicious. It was a bit overcooked but the flavors worked and the ingredients were fresh. The price was reasonable for the amount of food, in my opinion.  The service, however, was... bad, simply put. I waited a good 2 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. Then, I asked a few questions about a menu item and got a half-hearted shoulder shrug. Then, they forgot to make my order and didn't start on it until I went to check in nearly 10 minutes after I placed it. It wasn't that anyone was rude, necessarily, just apathetic. It was like they would rather be doing anything else at that given moment.  That in mind, along with the fact that the market has quite a few other food vendors to choose from, I can't really give it more than 2 stars. Next time I'm in the market, I may give it another try to see if this is an isolated thing. Hopefully it is because the food was pretty darn tasty.",

My curry chicken had just the right amount of spice with the curry sauce and mango chutney and I'll admit that the romaine lettuce provided a nice contrasting light crunch with every other bite. The pager system makes it easy to walk around the rest of the market or sit down to enjoy conversation with friends along with your beverage from Not Just Coffee or Tank's Tap.  Really, if you can't find something you like at Hazelnut's, then you just don't like food. Reasonable prices and quick service. Like every business in the 7th Street Market, there is plenty of opportunity for people-watching and easy parking in the garage, just make sure to find the little validation machine behind Viva Raw before leaving.",

    "text": "I found Hazelnuts Creperie to be grossly overpriced for average crepes. Visiting 7th Street Market on a Friday morning, I was excited to try as many \"breakfast\" vendors as possible to get the full experience. Of course the creperie caught my eye (I'm my grandma's child, what can I say?! She's given me her love of crepes!) and I walked up to pick from the wide crepe selection. I was a little surprised by the high prices initially, but assumed they must be stellar crepes. I chose a sweet crepe, to pair with a sammy from Loaf, and went with the classic \"Nutella banana\" (at a whopping $6.75--$7.31 with tax and addition change for syrup!!). I'm surprised to see a photo uploaded by another Yelper from four months ago showing that the prices have gone up $1! Yikes!  Crepes were already made and stacked in a pile ready to go. The market wasn't busy when I arrived, and during my time eating only one other crepe was ordered. Crepes were warm, but you could tell they'd been sitting in the open air. I certainly don't mind waiting for fresh food, but apparently they were expecting a crowd that morning. The Nutella banana crepe was nothing you couldn't make at home (I've got a great crepe recipe!) It was an okay experience, but one that I wouldn't pay that much to have again.",

Meanwhile some young girl started acting ghetto and clapping her hands and yelling at us telling us we were on our own and needed to wait. What kind of crappy attitude and service. Other people came up and canceled their order because of the long wait. And the crepe? So mediocre, poorly made, and falling apart. Taste like nothing. DONT COME HERE.",

    "text": "My friends and I were in town for a wedding, and we ventured over here to the Seventh Street Public Market for some food.  We explored the area to check it all out. I wasn't in the mood for something too heavy.  After weighing my options, I decided to have crepes.  And I don't regret it for one moment.   They have crepes for breakfast, generally savory ones, and sweet ones.  These crepes seem pretty hearty!  Our of hunger and curiosity, I went ahead and ordered two of them.  One savory, and one sweet.  I ended up getting the Chicken Bacon Ranch, then Nutella Banana.  I definitely enjoyed my savory crepe.  It was actually very dense and filling.  The sweet crepe was a safe option for me, as the crepes I have generally have these types of ingredients, so there was little to no chance this was going to be bad.  I suppose some might argue that this place is either slow or not fancy.  Are crepes supposed to be made quickly?  And is it sacrilege to serve crepes in anything except for fancy dishes?  I mean....it's a public market, so even though they want to set forth the best product possible, it's also out of convenience.  Good luck finding your coveted fancy fast food.  Just take it for what it is.  It's a stall that serves a variety of crepes that focuses more on quality and convenience rather than speed and absurd expectations.",

The creamy potato and the sweet spicy chutney were a perfect match. I wish I had gone back the next day for it again. I tried a little bit of the smoked BLT and thought it was just alright.

    "text": "My heart will always be at their Tryon (first) location, but I'm glad Hazelnuts is in the Public Market.  It's the perfect venue for the format of crepes... have/split a snack, eat breakfast or lunch..... either way, just know it will be delicious and awesome.  Since my office moved my train stop is 7th street station so it is dangerous since I can just hop off the train and grab a crepe before I head into the office.  The morning crowd is usually VERY relaxed, nothing too hectic.  Most of the other vendors in the market are prepping for lunch... the only other guys serving are Not Just Coffee and Local Loaf.  Same, great crepes on the menu.... and the staff is super nice... even if I'm up at the counter looking like a hungry puppy dog right at 8am when they open.  The pager system is a little more sophisticated here, probably just for the range since the market sprawls a little more than their original location.  Same disposable plates and plastic silverware here and just make sure to tell them if you want your order \"to go\" or for \"here\".  My \"go-to\" is the Mariachi (no onions please).  I tend to lean to the savory crepes rather than the dessert crepes.  To each their own!  You can even customize your crepe too.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  My favorite part of the crepe is the in-between the edges and the middle where it's not quite crispy, but not quite the center. So good!",

    "text": "Confession: I ate a dessert crepe for breakfast and it was magical. It comes out warm and crispy, with the perfect amount of fruit to (sinful) filling ratio. At least it had a banana in it so I could pretend it was a relatively balanced breakfast. The coffee was cheap, too, at under $2. Service was kind and efficient, and although they don't walk it out to your table, you are greeted with a smile when you pick it up. What more could you ask for?! :)  Pro-Tip: located inside 7th street public market!",

    "text": "I say \"let them eat Crepes\"! I don't understand when others don't - what's not to love? At Hazelnuts you can choose between sweet or savory or shoot just go for both but you better be hungry! My favorite crepes to get here is the Basil Chicken Pesto minus the tomatoes and/or the Nutella Banana - Yum!   This is my favorite restaurant to go to at 7th Street public Market because 1) food has always been consistently good, 2) if and when their is a line, it moves pretty fast and 3) they give you a buzzer so you know when your food is done instead of having someone track you down in the maze of tables.   My only hesitation for giving a five is I feel they could go above and beyond with having various options of toppings to drizzle over the crepe like a pesto or balsamic drizzle.   The other best part about this location is that it's neighbor is Tank's Tap so I can have my crepe and have my beer too!",

Crepes come sweet, savory, or breakfast. Not sure how they draw the lines because after having the candy coated sugar bomb they call Maple Dream the banana split looks almost healthy.  Got a food-pager and went in search of coffee, thing started ringing on the way back so my lovely bride hunted up a table while I gathered up the grub. Eggs, cheddar cheeses, bacons, maple syrups, powdered sugar, and butter. Mapling the Dream! A had Chevre & Mozz, I don't even know what that means...",
