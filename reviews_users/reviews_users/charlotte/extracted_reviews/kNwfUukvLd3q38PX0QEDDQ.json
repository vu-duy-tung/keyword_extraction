The fried chicken bowl looked great and came with a nice variety of veggies. The chicken was very well cooked and could not have possibly had less flavor. The side salad was worthless. The miso was decent. I ordered a beer. They never brought it but still charged me for it. Weak. Atmosphere = meh.  3 star it is.",

    "text": "Just tried this place for the first and I really enjoyed It! We carried out, the setup is a little confusing for takeout (I think it might make more sense towards the door so ppl aren't ordering in the middle of the seating area ). Between the 2of us, we ordered the chicken wings, fried chicken bowl, fried rice and had the side salad and coleslaw. More than enough food for dinner and everything was great! The service was super quick and friendly! I got in and out in about 10 minutes around 8 at night and spoke with both of who I assumed are managers/owners. I will be back and hopefully will try more of the sauces. The only suggestions I have, since I know they are brand new, would I would love to see more side and sauce options, and the register placement ( I felt rude ordering with people eating on both sides of me). Thank you for the great meal and service! Welcome to the neighborhood!",

Last night was a success! So make sure to look at their hours of operation before going;) But let's just say it was worth the effort and wait! I got the Bibim bowl with spicy pork and my fiance got the Fried Chicken bowl. Both were absolutely delicious! They were flavorful and very good portions. I had cole slaw as a side and he got the side salad with lemon ginger dressing. I actually preferred his side salad over my cole slaw. The pork dumplings were also very good as an appetizer. We sat outside on the patio and had a very nice experience. It was a great place to people watch too since you were in the heart of Southend. The wait staff were friendly, fast, and accommodating. Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you like good food, good atmosphere, and good people watching.",

All of our food came out cold, the miso soup and the japchae (forgot how to spell it). It's actually ridiculous how you have to pay an extra $1 for them to put the bibimbap in a hot stone bowl and you can't keep it?? (I mean, I don't want to keep it but why do I have to pay for something to be properly served) $14 for a bowl, YIKES!    Drinks were ordered but never came out. Which actually worked out because my friend and I were ready to leave anyways.  We should have known when stepping in the restaurant and there was not a Korean soul in sight. If there isn't a Korean man wearing a wife beater tank that doesn't speak a lick of English cooking the food, is it really a Korean restaurant?",

The fried rice is not prepared with Spam, so needless to say you'll be paying the Americanized tax. But the recipe is still very good. Service was prompt and friendly; the interior design is urban hipster. Thursday night wine selection is top notch. Thank you Alisa for the great wine recs and for boxing up the kalbi bones for my Mung Mung.",

No bad press intended, only a few suggestions...I understand Charlotte is a beer city, and I love our local beer, but I would have liked to have had a Cass or Hite Korean beer, rather than an IPA. So it would be nice to see that on the beer list.   Also the traditional side dishes that typically come with a. Korean meal would be great as well.  Also would be nice to just have chopsticks rather than having to ask for them.",

I excitedly ordered the spicy pork bulgogi bowl and was not disappointed. The portion was generous and the spicy sauce left me feeling warm while not being overpowering. I was genuinely surprised at how well the corn and radish worked in the dish!  I also ordered pot stickers as a starter and found the sauce very pleasing. I actually felt a bit empty emotionally upon finishing the pot stickers because I could have easily sat there and consumed them on their own until full.  The staff were very relaxed and friendly and I didn't feel rushed at all, which is something I've come to expect while stateside.",

YES.\" So I went in. The place is fairly new, waitress said it opened in September.   The service was exceptional, the lady I assume to be the owner was very welcoming and happy to have customers.  I got the Beef Bulgogi Box. I read on here that the portion sizes were small. Boy was that a lie. It was massive, the plating was aesthetic, worthy of a photo if you're the kind of person to post food pics on social media.   The taste was good. Is it the best Bulgogi I've ever had? Not by a long shot. But definitely good. You'll find yourself short on complaints.  I've paid way more for Bulgogi so I was satisfied.   All in all, good restauarant. Hope more Korean Spots show up in Charlotte in the futures",

Another great example of the help staff at this restaurant: their bathrooms are fkn impeccable.  They always smell rosy and look like they've just been disinfected.  I strongly support any restaurant who pays attention to so much detail that the bathroom is fantastic because they probably share that attention to detail and cleanliness with the kitchen and food.",

The beef Bulgogi was OK but not authentic at all. Service was horrible and I had to wait more than ten minutes from ordering a drink to get one, and they are not worth the price. If you are looking for good Korean food or service go elsewhere. Also I think the server forgot to put in my daughters food, because it came out 15 minutes after the rest of the meal.",

It was my mom's early birthday dinner so we sneaked a cake and the manager (I think) was so kind to set it up for us and everything. I got the Korean Fried Chicken Bowl and the chicken was really good! The portions are large and I loved the pickles in the dish. I do not like the sauce because it can get overwhelming. I would ask for the sauce on the side so you can control how much sauce you want in your dish. The BB Frites are SOOOOO GOOD I mean SOOOOOO GOOD. I'm not a fry person but I could eat these all day!!!

    "text": "Being a huge fan of Korean food, I was excited to check out this new location near me in South End. There was a lot of things we wanted to try on the menu but limited our choices to the entrees below:  Spicy Pork Bulgogi Box - I originally wanted the Spicy Pork Bibim Bowl and even though I was hesitant to order because they charged $1 extra to be served in a clay pot, they didn't have any and said they were on order. My next choice was the Spicy Pork Bulgogi Box. It honestly was kind of bland and lacking a lot of flavors, especially if you're use to authentic spicy pork bulgogi.  Korean Fried Chicken B.B. Wrap - I LOVE scallion pancakes so we had to give this a try.  It's a very interesting concept considering that scallion pancakes are a Chinese dish.  The chicken was a little on the dry side and the wrap could definitely use more flavors.  It was also difficult to eat without falling apart everywhere so I would recommend cutting it in half. Overall, I could see this dish being pretty tasty with some improvement.  Overall this place was ok.  The service was great but I was really disappointed when I asked for chopsticks, only to find out they didn't have any and said it was on order.  I felt as if they took away from the dining experience because what chopstick user eats Korean food with a fork? Also, it would also be nice to offer kimchi to accompany the dishes since it's a Korean staple but then again, I don't think they're aiming to be traditional.  If you're use to authentic Korean food, you might be a little disappointed in this place.  Being that they're new, I hope things improve and maybe I'll give it another try in the future.",

There is outdoor seating but it was way too hot to sit outside on the day we went. We ordered the beef bowl and chicken bowl. The beef was better. (In our opinion)   It's an American-Asian taste, so not authentic.  We understand that service can get busy, but the cashier kept rushing us to leave so other guests can sit. He started 5 minutes after we got our food:(",

Wow it was a beautiful dish but it was underwhelming. It was that weird temperature where you know it's not supposed to be a cold dish but it's by no means hot... or warm even. I watched them make it too so I know it didn't sit long before getting to me.   Service was good but there were only 3 tables so hard to have bad service then.   Overall is was that doesn't-taste-as-good-as-it-looks heartbreak. The spicy pork wasn't spicy at all. For having a lot of ingredients, it wasn't overly flavorful.  EDIT: knocked it down to 2 stars. Reheated the leftovers (I'm a leftover queen) and it was inedible. Like I had to throw it away and go get something else which I NEVER do. I don't think the only issue was it being cold.",

Two of the short ribs looked fine but the other one looked really old, dark, and tough to chew. My father could tell right away when the server brought it out to us. The coleslaw was fine. My Beef Bulgogi Box dish with white rice was ok.. the beef was a little bit burnt. The salad that came with it was actually really good. Fresh, clean cut, tasty dressing. Loved it. My father had the Bibim Bowl and it was good. Lots of vegetables, large portion, very tasty. Service was great, restaurant was clean, loved the decorations. I would come back to try other dishes but not anytime soon.",

Outside of the more traditional Pepero, which is a bit far from us, Bulgogi Box is the only Korean restaurant that we've found in Charlotte that has impressed us and earned repeat visits.   Bulgogi Box is a modern take on Korean cuisine that keeps the flavors close to home while still making each dish their own. The staff are friendly as well and make sure that you are well taken care of.  My girlfriend and I have been twice in the past month or so and have ordered the same thing both times: Two spicy pork bulgogi boxes with kimchi as the side, as well as dumplings and kalbi for appetizers.  The dumplings have strong, fresh flavors and we're pretty sure they're hand made. The kalbi(beef short ribs) are marinated perfectly and the meat is delicious. The spicy pork bulgogi box consists of pork with the traditional spicy red Korean sauce based on gochujang, some onions, and underneath a bed of well cooked white rice. The \"bulgogi box\" is actually served in a bowl, but don't worry -- you'll probably need a box anyways as the portion sizes are generous enough that finishing it all is hard.",

Overall they were amazing. The Beef Bulgogi Box was absolutely amazing. It was absolutely favorite thing. My boyfriend, Justin had something amazing too. You had him eating stuff he never does. Which surprised me. They B.B Fritta's were amazing. I thought with the seasoning it would be spicy but it surprised me. They were not! I love this place. Morgan was the best server/Bartender. The food and service was amazing. I highly recommend it. The dish I recommend is the Beef Bulgogi Box.",

It feels fresh and clean inside. 2) Staff: Extremely friendly, just as attentive as you want, yet not overly so. The manager came by and made sure we were enjoying things. 3) Food: AMAZING. I don't know of anywhere else in Charlotte you can get this kind of Korean food. It reminds of a place I've been in NYC. Both of our dishes were extremely flavorful and pleasing to the eye. The portions were generous as well. Service was fast.  They also had a good amount of local beer on tap and a good drink menu.",

Nothing about Korean food should be bland! The tofu is over fried and the sauces are kind of Americanized. I also found the service to be pretty slow. I really really wanted to like it and hope they turn it around. It's a killer location and Southend should be all over this type of place. It kind of feels like they need to pick a land: either full on Korean (not some weird fusion) or go the Americanized route. Or go full on Korean fusion - everyone loves a bulgogi beef taco.",

You can substitute crispy tofu on the other dishes. The service was great and friendly. They knew we were in a rush and accommodated us quickly. Can't wait to go again!

You really can't beat their Friday special of a beer & potstickers for $10. Their potstickers are VERY good too.  We are adding this place to our regular restaurant rotation.

The exterior and interior was perfect for this kind of setting. We ordered spicy Korean chicken wings and two hot pot bim bim bowl. Everything was very good. My buddy who never had Korean food before loved it. Service was excellent even at their lunch time. Definitely go here again.

The Lady and I checked out Bulgogi Box pretty close to closing, maybe around 9:15 for a late dinner. It's a lot more sit-down oriented than I thought, but still a relatively small seating space. Our food came out pretty quickly, and was piping hot! I ordered the Beef Bulgogi Box, which I was honestly a bit tentative about because... I mean, it's $14 for beef, rice, and some scallions.   Naw fam. It's way more than that. And it honestly made 2.5 meals for me. The beef was incredibly tasty and moist and the spice level was PERFECT. Ingredients were high quality and cooked well, and that justifies the price for me. The Lady's meal came out awesome as well, she ordered the hand pie. We both got the cole slaw, which while fresh, was nothing really that special.   I will say that when we arrived, they had run out of several things (ingredients like pickled veggies) which took a few options off the table for us, so that is the only reason why I'm taking off a star. We'll absolutely be back here again to try some more menu items, and I'm looking forward to exploring more of what they're menu has to offer! South End gets another point from me!",

The miso was very unique, the beef bowl was okay. My husband ordered something that reminded us of a taco. He really enjoyed his meal. It had some seasoned French fries with a hot dipping sauce.  My mother-in-law had steak with white rice and we shared an order of fried wings. The wings were fine nothing impressive. At the end we order a lemon raspberry cheesecake  cake or something like that. It was half cake and half cheesecake. That thing was really delicious!!!! Very creative, flavorful, moist dessert.  Other than the dessert I don't see other reason to go back. Oh before I forget they have neutral gender restrooms. I thought it was a great differential!",

I got the spicy pork bibi bowl and opted for the hot bowl. Do the hot bowl, it's so delicious when the rice gets crispy.   I really wanted the lychee lemonade cocktail but they ran out of sochu, so I got the lavenders bees knees instead. It was a bit on the sweet side and hit the spot. They have frozen lavender bits in the ice cube!  I can't wait to come back!!",

I appreciated his expertise with the menu options.  If anyone knows Korean food, it is Tom.  I ordered a tofu bowl that came with corn and mushrooms and collard greens.  It was served over rice and there's was a runny egg on top, which Initially turned me off, but I ended up liking it.  Runny yolks are typically just not my thing. The tofu looked like tiny croutons and I loved it.  Tom pointed out the small details that are very typical in Korean restaurants.  Examples were how the silverware was completely enfolded in the napkins, the sauces came in individual bowls versus squeeze bottles, and the lemon slices came on skewers in a little bowl.  The atmosphere here is very trendy. The server was Korean and very efficient.    The only downfall was the noise level.  The high ceilings and hard surfaces were just not good for acoustics, however the visual appeal was fabulous.   Good value for the money.  Two thumbs up!",

My boyfriend got the chicken bibimbap, which he likes, but he said he liked my Bulgogi Box better. It definitely had lots of flavor & tasted like the traditional Korean Bulgogi but not to be too stingy because we are Korean, it was salty & beef was broken up a lot but it's understandable. The portion is filling (a bit overpriced) but still tasty. I like their potstickers too. Their Bloody Mary is a no go, but that's because we realize we don't like Bloody Mary so for those that do like it, try it out! Service was kind",

We order our food, and everything came out fast. The miso soup came at the same time with out entree as well, but it was room temperate. Did not even feel like I was having soup.

Normally things say \"spicy\" and it's a subtle flavor, but the pork was great and the red sauce they gave to add on put it over the top. Tons of flavor from both the veggies and the meat!

I tried to look up an online menu, but there's no website unless I missed it?   Bulgogi Box is located on the corner of West Blvd. and Camden Rd. There's a free parking deck. I can't remember if street parking is available or not. This restaurant is small and charming, the staff is GREAT! Our waitress was informative and fun, she gave awesome suggestions without pushing us to order. There are daily specials every day, be sure to take advantage of them!  We started with Miso soup and Potstickers which are basically pan-seared dumplings,  I think the filling was pork and chicken. We also ordered the Korean Fried Chicken Wings, this was my personal favorite!  There are a few flavor options to choose from. We tried the honey butter and spicy Korean red. Most people love the honey butter, this was a little plain for my palate. The spicy Korean red was a more mild sweet flavor which I LOVED!  Our Entrees! We selected the Beef Bulgogi and Spicy Pork Bulgogi Box. Both entrees were served with sauteed onions, scallions, and white rice. I love pork! However, I think the Beef Bulgogi was better in my opinion. Who am I kidding! I should've placed a to go order.  So will I come back? Uhhh YES!",

The spicy Korean fried chicken wings really delicious. They came out fresh and did not disappoint. I think that they are one of my favorite Korean style wings I've ever had. The Korean slaw that it was served with was more salty than pickled (would not suggest it for a side). The B.B. Frites were also really good, crisp, and light and the Korean spice blend and spicy aioli went really well with it.  I always love a good bibimbap so I ordered the BimbimBowl with a sizzling pot and it was SO GOOD.  All the veggies and beef bulgogi was on point and it really satisfied my craving for good asian food. The kimchi side that I got was not too pickled or spicy but still good if you're white and has never had any before.  For drinks my group ordered the TikiTime, The Best Mule and the Begonia Sangria. All the drinks were really strong but my favorite would have to be the Tiki Time! It was super fruity and light and recommended by the waitress.  If you're looking for straight up traditional Korean food, Bulgogi Box may not be the best place for you. But definitely a great spot for a casual dinner. After ordering all my food and drinks, it was a dab on the expensive side for what you got but I would definitely eat here again.",

Weird thing to mention but the seats directly outside of the main door are deceptively soft! Very comfy.   We both are fans of Korean fare and enjoy traditional style Korean food and modern takes of Korean fare. I would say this is closer to modern but still very tasty! I got the beef Bulgogi fried rice with an egg and the sriracha aioli which came with a side and I chose the kimchi. I enjoyed the dish and the flavors were great. I love fried rice and beef Bulgogi so the two together was joy.   I believe we got the pleasure to meet the owner and she was super nice. She greeted us when we came in and came over to the table to chat. When we left she waved from behind the counter which was really nice. Our waiter was also very helpful in suggesting options and add ons and even invited us to their live music night. I love when restaurants tell you about the events they have going on as I am always looking for something different to do!   I really enjoyed my time at Bulgogi Box!",

Although I'm not a big fan of \"BiBimBap\", a popular Korean bowl, THAT is precisely what I ordered...just because this happens to be a signature house speciality (aside from Bulgogi itself, that is).  I was so relieved to discover that they actually did justice to \"BiBimBap\"... something that's been a rarity than the norm in this town.  As expected, their Bulgogi was excellent!  I was also impressed with their stylish version of Potstickers.  For some reason, I expected street-level food...but the food, as well as its presentation, was rather upscaled.  The place itself is small, but chic...and the service was stellar. Overall, I really liked what this place had to offer...and am already looking forward to trying a few more items off their menu! In a way, this is the Korean restaurant that I've been waiting for...  Authentic K food in a trendy, modern setting, and most importantly, great, Americanized service (which is greatly lacking in many \"authentic\" Korean restaurants).",

When Bulgogi Box finally opened their doors, we immediately had to check it out, and it did not disappoint! The flavors were spot on, and the staff was pleasant as well. I ordered the Spicy Pork Bibim Bowl for lunch. It was a hefty amount of food, yet the proportions of spicy pork, vegetables, & rice were well-balanced. I enjoyed every bite.  There are a lot of other tempting options on the menu (plus a chalkboard with some enticing happy hour deals), so I plan to keep trying different items and figure out my favorites. Bulgogi Box is a keeper. :D",

We ordered the Kalbi appetizer, Bulgogi  Bowl no onions or scallions (they allowed customization  which is awesome ), and Fried Chicken Bowl.  The food tasted authentic with a fusion twist.   The Kimchee was fresh and crunchy.   The fries is a must try.  It was crunchy and well seasoned.   The fried chicken was crispy and tasty.    Sorry no pictures this time since we were so hungry but the photos from the other yelpers are pretty accurate.   I also met the owner/chef.  She greeted me and thanked us for eating there.  I told her that her food was delicious as it was.  The decor was nice and elegant.  The restaurant was clean.  Easy metered street parking available.",

    "text": "This is really a 2.5 in my book. I was excited for this restaurant to open because I love Korean cuisine (I had already drafted my review with 5-stars), but I was not impressed.   The setup and ambiance fits perfectly into the flare of South End. However, it can get a little crowded and confusing if you're trying to order to-go, as there's not a good flow (we'll count that to the newness). The menu is pretty straight forward and the prices represent the surrounding area, so keep that in mind before going all out.   I initially wanted to give the Korean Wings a try, but I decided to try the Beef Bulgogi Box and that totaled to $12.87... a little steep for lunch, but I figured what the heck! The cashier was nice and the other employees seemed to be smiling, so that counted towards the meal being worth it (maybe?Idk).   I was provided a number and waited at the small table facing the window. I wasn't quite sure how I would know my order was ready, as there was not an announcement. I soon learned that there was a young lady with to-go orders going around to each person with a number to give them their order (there's room for improvement with that process, but again let's count it to the newness). Once I received my order, I was out of the door 15-20 minutes tops... which is typical for any busy lunch area.   My disappointment came when preparing to enjoy my lunch. The Beef Bulgogi box is a very small portion for the price. The serving size could fit in my hand (by healthy standards that's a good thing, don't get me wrong... but I wasn't aiming to be healthy lol) and I probably would have let all of this slide had the taste been worth it. The beef taste as if it was grilled and tossed in soy sauce, then called Korean; very Americanized. Not to mention, once I started eating I realized that the beef consisted of more fat than actual meat.   I cannot say that I will be trying this place again any time soon, but I am not going to count them out. By all means fellow Yelpers, go support this local business and provide your feedback, as your experience may be much better than mine. I simply look forward to the improvements.",

The heartfelt memories of my mother's bulgogi (which I just realized after years of being Korean could be directly translated as \"fire meat\") led me to be intrigued by Charlotte's surprisingly well-Yelp-reviewed Korean BBQ restaurants.  So we went to Bulgogi Box and got the spicy pork fried rice and, of course, the Bulgogi Box, and we were pleasantly satisfied. While the bulgogi lacked a True Korean seasoning (the True Korean Mother's Bulgogi), it was well-cooked, had the beauty of sesame oil, and the rice was delicious. The spicy pork fried rice is spicy, be warned, but the spice and the pork came together for a good-tasting dish. My only wish is that the bulgogi went all the way; less accommodating and more BulGOgi.",

The space is small, but along the rail line. When I got take-out, they gave us water while we waited. The menu is full of Korean flavors. You have options of salads, bowls with rice and wraps. There are two signature proteins, beef bulgogi (of course) and spicy pork.   I don't normally hand out five stars especially when I haven't dined in, but when the food is so good, I start craving it, it deserves the best rating. The salad is good and has a nice light dressing. But the B.B. wrap is a game changer. This thing is huge. I got it with bulgogi and there was a lot of it. The wrap is a delicious scallion pancake. Paired with greens and pickled veggies, it is the perfect pairing of sweet and savory. If that's not enough, it's paired with the B.B. fries. I didn't realize this when I ordered. I'm trying not to eat fried foods, but one bite and soon I devoured the fries. They are dusted in a spice and served with aoili.   I can't wait to try more from this restaurant.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner. It was near impossible to have our orders taken after being seated. I had the beef Bibimbap Bowl (comes with soft boiled egg, cucumbers, corn, shredded carrots, collard greens, mushroom, radish, and kimchi over a bed of rice for $14). I absolutely loved the freshness and combination of all the flavors. However, I did not care for the miso soup (1 side included with main meal). Also ordered Korean Fried Chicken Wings with spicy Korean red sauce (honey butter was not available, unfortunately), which was served with coleslaw (6 pieces for $9.50). It took a significantly long time to have it arrive at our table though. In fact, we were long done with our main course meal and ready to leave by the time our appetizer finally arrived. Not to mention, we spent most of our dinner waiting in general, constantly neglected. Waitresses passed by every so often but hardly glanced in our direction (note: we were not the only ones being neglected). They only came by to clean empty tables. It wasn't even packed at the restaurant. Our server did apologize a couple times about our forever pending order of wings and told us that she would put a \"rush\" on our order with the cook. It was beyond ridiculous, but still, we did not complain. We tried to stay patient and understanding. At some point, the manager/owner (?) came out to our table with our appetizer (finally!), but at that point, it was so late that we decided to pack it up in a to-go box and head home. We were beyond tired. However, we were told by our server that the manager was offering a complimentary dessert as an apology for how long it took to receive our appetizer. We had the lemon raspberry cake slice (normally $6), which was absolutely delicious. It had just the right amount of sweetness and was so moist! We were very appreciative of this kind gesture.  This place is small and easy to miss, but the food tastes good. The prices are typical for the restaurants in this area, aka pricey. Hopefully the wait time/service improves.",

It was like I was eating on a plate (or bowl) inside of the restaurant.   The place was on the smaller side but had plenty of seating and sunlight coming in. I did notice they had a wide variety of liquor at their bar. They must have a good evening crowd. I would like to come here again to try the dry rub chicken wings.   Also, be mindful of parking at meters before 5pm. I inserted a quarter and that 15min was plenty of time for me to come and go.",

My husband and I visited twice in a week because the food is delicious. So as we were planning our drive here, we knew it would be first on the list for lunch.  The spicy pork bulgogi is amazing. So tasty, so spicy, so good. The coleslaw that comes with it was different than it was last time, it seems like they added a lot of pepper. I liked it better before as it was a nice cool down next to such a spicy dish. This time it was just too much spice so I couldn't eat it all. And I like spicy everything.  Service is great and the restaurant is always nice. Fast service, friendly faces, excellent food for the win!",

It was ok. I wasn't too impressed. I probably will not order another cocktail here.   We began with the pot stickers. Delicious!  Then ordered two entrees with sides. Bibim spicy pork bowl and the Jabchae hand pie. Also got Asian coleslaw side and side salad and pickles. Surprisingly, the hand pie was my favorite! The sides were also delicious. Bibim bowl was also good. I was just really surprised with how much I liked the hand pie.   The owner came up to us after we had finished our meal and asked us how everything was. She was so kind and grateful for our business. I want to come back just for her.",

The Bulgogi was to die for with tons of meat and the sticky rice was just right!  The atmosphere was warm, welcoming, and relaxing.

The service was fast and friendly, the decor and ambience are fresh and clean, and the music level was low enough to be enjoyable, but not too loud.  I have been waiting on a non-fusion Korean restaurant to open in town and this is as close as you can come in the downtown Charlotte area.",

They were all very kind ladies throughout our dining experience. Since the Panthers game was playing, we had asked if we could move from our table to the bar to watch the game from their one TV screen. Our waitress did not mind at all. I ordered the pork bulgogi fried rice and he ordered the beef bibimbap. We are avid Korean food fans, and we already knew this place wasn't your traditional korean food restaurant. We still enjoyed the food, nonetheless, and it was very flavorful. The side dishes were also delicious (I had cucumber pickles and he had kimchi) and fell more on the authentic side. We were satisfied with both the food and customer service so we will be visiting this place again.",

    "text": "Sads.  I\"m not sure what went wrong with this place.  There is so much potential for class act East and SE Asian food in Charlotte given the ever expanding population of folks from that part of the world.  Super G on Independence, the Laotian take out place on Tyvola, and classics like Lang Vanh are all exemplary of the trends.  Having said that, I was bummed to bring my friend here for his first taste of Bulgoki.  For anyone who's ever had real Korean food, bulgoki should come hot as fuck, in a bowl you can't touch, with crispy rice, fresh veg, and a perfectly poached egg to slather on top.  The poached egg at this joint is commendable, but other than that, the meal was an entire let down.  The veg was cold and acrid, the rice was also cold and mealy.  There were weird pieces of chicken in my friends bowl that were so hard they were inedible. To top things off:  you have to pay extra to have the food brought in a bulgoiki bowl!  WTF.  Bulgoki, by definition, is all about the hot bowl and crispy rice.  Instead you get a bowl of cold rice with vegetables and some meat on top.  That's so not Korean bulgoki :(    At $14 a pop, w/out the hot bowl, I was baffled by the whole experience.  If you want amazing Korean food, take the time to drive out to the food market and deli at Super G.  It's bomb, super authentic, and well worth the trip.  Plus you can get the best bubble tea in town on your way out.  Certainly don't bring a \"first timer\" to Bulgoki Box.  It'll make them question, if not choose to not try, Korean food, and that'd be a shame.",

For my entree my husband and I shared the bulgogi box (beef and rice) and the bimbim bowl (pork vegetables and rice) Great flavor  in all of the dishes.

It was a couple stops away and close by to the train stop, which was very convenient for me. The staff was very nice and the menu, I guess or was considered American-Korean fusion. I ordered the crispy tofu box and it was surprisingly good. I went back to my hotel room after an hour and to my surprise the tofu was still crispy and maintained its crunch! Although I asked for a spicy aioli that never made it to my tofu box.. But overall the food was still great. I wish I stayed a bit longer and had a chance to order and try more food from their menu! Recommend this place for vegetarians and non vegetarians, this place is inexpensive and worth the price.",

I had to wait about 10 min to get my card back while I watched my waiter take additional orders and bring food to other tables. Secondly, I watched as my server took a bowl, the same that my B.B. Frites were served in, and filled it with water so that a dog at the next table can drink out of!!! That is when I asked for my check. That is beyond unsanitary!!! Just from a perception standpoint, they should not be using serving bowls for pets. I will not be returning.",

I stopped by this past weekend while visiting friends in Charlotte, and was excited to have some awesome korean food. The place was packed when we arrived, so I figured that was a good sign. The food looked good on the menu: we ordered fries and the bibimbap bowl, and miso soup. The waiters/waitress took forever to greet us, brought us the wrong food (and then of course took it away) and then at the end of service mixed up our checks and charged the wrong cards for the wrong orders (we split a ticket...its really not that complicated). The miso soup was not good, at all and the bibimbap lacked flavor. I was really disappointed. Fries and the sauce were really the only thing I liked.",

    "text": "Yikes! That was terrible...  I have never found a good reason to poorly rate a restaurant, but my experience at Bulgogi Box tonight deserves a review.   We were greeted by your very cheery \"marketing manager\" she asked how we had heard about the fairly new location and encouraged us to \"follow...follow...follow\" \"share...share...share\"! So at your request ma'am, here goes.    Your service was terrible. I witnessed the table my right confront their server about being slipped a $ up-charge for a \"sizzling bowl\" that was not requested and was in awe as the server explained she had done it for his own good \"it's hard to explain table side.\"   The table to the left waited so long on the server to touch back that one of the guys finally walked up to the bar to pay. It's important I mention there were only 5 small tables of customers in the whole place, including us, and there were 3 servers/staff.  That should have been our hint, but we stuck with our game plan. We ordered two bowls from our server (same lady from the other two tables). Her personality could have used a sprinkle of warmth, but to each their own.  Food came out quickly, mind you it's 8:45pm, and all other diners have left. The food hit the table and the 3 servers/staff (marketing manager included) immediately began to close up shop. Music turned way up, talking across the room, banging and clanging, vacuuming, etc. No one ever checked in on us. We seemed to be holding them back from closing their doors at 9:00pm. It should be noted their operating hours are until 10:00pm. We quickly ate, feeling uncomfortable, and walked up to the  bar to pay the check we were never given, as we walked out the door.   Just a bit of advice Bulgogi Box. If you are admittedly having trouble generating business, and creating a reputation in the South End neighborhood, start with customer service! Your food was just okay, and your ambiance was cookie cutter. Restaurants prosper or fail through guests' experiences.",
