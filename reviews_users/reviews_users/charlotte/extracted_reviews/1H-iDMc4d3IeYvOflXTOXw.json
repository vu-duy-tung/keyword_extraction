They do have a 2nd floor deck that used to have a great view of Uptown, but that is now obstructed. You'll find average service, the occasional karaoke and a plentiful amount of TV's and games like darts and Golden Tee.",

It's not like I have anything bad to really say about the place.  I just have nothing good to say about it either.",

The Gin Mill is a fun bar with lots of friendly staff.  I've seen some pretty good local musicians play here and definitely have played my share of shuffleboard and foosball.   They used to do trivia here during the week - can't remember which night though.   The cool little deck gets really crowded on game-days and sometimes on weekends as well. It can be tough to get a drink up there, but no matter, just grab one from the friendly bartenders downstairs before you head up.    If you are looking for a cool little unpretentious watering-hole, you should give it a try.",

When we initially went here we figured it would be a hole in the wall with decent prices. Fortunately after a few drinks at the apartment and venturing uptown to a couple of bars it was refreshing to hang out in such a quaint spot. The bartenders were both interested, friendly and helpful AND serve up some fantastic beverages. The late night Saturday DJ is a local, but really brings the best beats.  To reiterate I recommend coming to this bar on a weekend night to chill out and have a pleasant time.",

There are dart machines, Golden Tee, and even karaoke.  Based on my visits, there always seems to be a good vibe and the people I interact with are always friendly.  Parking can be a pain, but worrying about being underdressed is not.  There is no need to put on airs.  Atmosphere - Casual neighborhood bar, a dive bar without as much disrepair as the name would normally imply, the college crowd and older folk hangout in harmony       Service - Friendly and prompt  Overall - The Gin Mill South End is a great place to meet up with your friends to start off your night or in my case a great place to end the night before heading home.",

I wouldn't go as far as calling it a dive bar, but if you're looking for frills and whistles, you may be disappointed. Cheap beer, fun bar games, and a beautiful rooftop terrace overlooking Southend. You won't find food here but there is free popcorn at your disposal. For most, I wouldn't call the Gin Mill a destination bar; more-so a great meeting point for you and your buddies, a place to pre-game before a concert or event, or place to stop by and have a few beers along your journey.   One thing to be very mindful of is parking... It's almost non-existent. If there is a concert at Amos' or a big event at the neighboring Tavern on the Tracks, famous for housing Buffalo fans of all sports, you'll struggle to find parking. Don't just pull in anywhere that you can; towing for neighboring has been prevalent.",

If you are a transplant from any blue collar city, the Gin Mill will make you feel at home as it is reminiscent of bars in those cities.  They have shuffleboard, darts, and a few other games.  They also have some killer beer specials every day.  There is a nice rooftop bar that used to have a great view of uptown until they built the condos across the street.

Warning, the step after the foosball table is treacherous. Also, you can find some genuinely shady characters sitting at the bar on a weeknight.

    "text": "One of my all-time favorite bars in CLT. The place always has energy flowing through it even on a weeknight. A nice beer selection on tap including Angry Orchard, Purple Haze and Greenman. It's good to see a small local joint that mixes up their taps and doesn't just have the standard Bud and Miller on draught. Good number of bottles as well so easy to find a favorite.   The place is a very laid back feel and the doorman who checks IDs (never a cover charge) has always been incredibly nice. Steven is usually behind the bar slinging drinks which is a very good thing. I've become a regular here and he's great at taking care of our group.   The rooftop is great to grab some air and is typically less crowded than the downstairs on Fridays and Saturdays. They have a rooftop bar but sometimes it's open and sometimes it's not. Cornhole on the roof and darts, foosball and shuffleboard downstairs for your entertainment. Seems they always have live tunes on Saturdays and occasionally on Fridays as well - never heard a bad band here and best part is the band is obviously loud but it doesn't overtake the entire bar - I can stand over by foosball and here what the person next to me is saying - feel like that's a rariety for a lot of bars!  Warning though the bar gets beyond packed after 11 or midnight on the weekends - can make it hard to get another drink or your tab at that point so you may wanna double fist and pay as you go. And if that's not your scene, just duck out early. Parking can sometimes be a pain and you'll drive around for 10 minutes looking for a space but just know that the Gin Mill is definitely worth the effort.",

The dance area is elevated a foot from the main floor and the bar is behind it. Your standard selection of liquor and beers and decent daily specials.   This place is so-so in my books of bars. Very casual and during the summertime you can come here and head up to the roof and just relax. And that's what the place is. A relaxer. Seems more like boozed up coffee joint to me. The bartenders are helpful and the bouncers know when to kick \"that\" person out.   If you want a relaxing night out and not get dressed up for anywhere else, then come on over to the Gin Mill. Otherwise, you have plenty of other selection in Charlotte.",

There's never a cover, they always have a miller lite for $3, and the live music is always kick ass!\"  Well, he was right on...... While it conjures up verbal images of a bar bordering on \"dive bar\" standards, it has become one of my old favorites.  Comfortable, laid back, great rooftop patio, awesome drink specials, incredible bands every weekend, and a place where you can play darts, shuffleboard, corn hole, and bring your own dice!

    "text": "First off, this is the first review I've ever written on this site. I've never had an experience that I felt the need to write about, and I felt that everyone else covered everything in this city pretty well. After tonight, I felt the need to post my opinion about this place. I use this site plenty for checking out new restaurants and bars and I hope people read my review as a warning too.  I will start off by saying that I went to Gin Mill tonight specifically to play trivia with a group of friends who go there every week. Last week the team came in first and won a $20 gift certificate. Tonight, our team came in first again and we won an additional $20 gift certificate and even a \"free\" round of drinks. Nathan Richie runs trivia and he is a stand up guy who spent a good bit of time with us after the game chatting and just being really friendly. I think he's great and I love the game he ran.  The trouble came after he left, at the close of night when we closed our tab. We came with a group of five, 2 of which weren't even drinking. Our drinking was broken down pretty easily... We won a round of 5 Blue Moon beers (again, 3 of us were drinking, so 2 of the 5 freebie beers were redistributed between the 3 of us)... As for paid beers we had the following:  Me: 3 Miller High Lifes, 1 Blue Moon Person #2: 3 Blue Moons, 1 High Life Person #3: 2 Blue Moons, 2 High Lifes For a grand total of 5 Miller High Lifes and 7 Blue Moons to pay for.  We also had our 5 \"free\" Blue Moons, so we had a total of 17 beers between the group.  We went to pay our tab at the end of the night, and we had a $20 gift certificate for placing first in trivia the week before. We figured that would cover the bulk of our beers, so we didn't bring much money. We were presented with a tab for 12 Blue Moons and either 6 or 7 High Lifes (I don't remember which number it was as I was more focused on the extra Blue Moons, since High Life was only $2). We argued with the bartender that it was way wrong and that he was charging us for our free round of Blue Moon (since we DID drink 12 Blue Moons, but 5 were supposed to be free due to trivia that night) and he claimed that he already took 5 off the tab.   The bartender was accusing the three of us of drinking 22-23 beers between us, which wasn't correct in the least. We tried to argue with him. When we closed my girlfriend was with us and she was one of the 2 people who didn't have an ounce of alcohol to drink... She could even recount how many beers we had and knew that we were being accused over 5-6 beers more then we got.  What was great is that we asked if anyone else had ordered drinks on our tab and he said \"maybe when you first got here,\" which alarmed us. The entire night we only had 1 person order drinks for our table the whole night. No one else went to the bar to order a single drink for us.  He wouldn't listen to us and eventually we got him to take our freshly earned gift certificate from trivia that night (one that we planned to use next tuesday) towards the 5-6 extra beers he added to our tab.  I loved the trivia and the guy who ran it was great, but the bartender is either an idiot or decided that he didn't agree with how much money he was making that night and thought he could squeeze an extra $20-30 out of a group.",

So my friend & I headed over to the Gin Mill to check the scores of the game before the main act came on stage. From the moment we walked in, you could tell this place was a sports bar. This probably had to due with the fact that they are a Notre Dame friendly bar, & the Irish were playing, but it still was a very lively atmosphere. With plenty of tvs throughout the place, there wasn't a bad seat in the house to catch the game. I'm not sure if it's always as crazy when the Irish aren't playing, but it was great when they were.  While it was a short trip to the Gin Mill, I think it's a great little bar to check out if you're at Amos' and tired of that scene. You can pop into the Gin Mill pretty quickly & grab a drink. And if the Irish are playing, look out.",

    "text": "I had never been to Gin Mill's previous location, so I can't compare the new to the old. With that being said, I ended up here on a Tuesday night and grabbed a seat at the bar with my friend. We shared the tempura chicken fingers and a make your own flatbread with chicken, bacon and mozzarella as our toppings. I liked the unique twist on the chicken tenders as these seemed lighter and crispier than your typical breaded tenders. The ranch and honey mustard that came on the side for dipping was delicious! The flatbread pizza was good, but not great. The chicken seemed to be slightly over cooked and cut into too large of chunks for the pizza.  I would suggest trying one of their already created flatbreads which are probably better thought out and taste tested. They are opening the rooftop bar in about two weeks, so that definitely sets them apart from most bars in southend. Also, there is an extensive amount of tvs with ample space to make this a perfect location for watching sports or grabbing a quick bite to eat.",

    "text": "The new Gin Mill was just alright today. The building and space is nice. It's not massive inside, but there was a decent amount of room with a small upstairs section. Food prices and drink prices were pretty reasonable. The food was what was lacking. I got buffalo wings. They were a little dry and overcooked. It's an extra charge if you want celery and carrots. They came served with ranch. The strange part was the wings were served with the wing tips still on. This is a totally useless part of the wing that is not worth the extra biting. They were not spicy at all. My girlfriend ordered a wrap, and was given the wrong one. The bar staff was friendly and attentive. Have to go 3 stars based on the quality of food and the mess up, but if going just for drinks it's a solid pick with tons of TVs.",

    "text": "Do you remember when bars were actually bars? Not \"sports\" bars or lounges or brew houses or any other such nonsense. I'm talking about real bars with dark interiors (especially during the middle of the day), games to amuse yourself while drinking (pool, darts, etc.), and a casual atmosphere where you could strike up a friendly chat or be left totally alone.  Gin Mill is one of those few places. It's not a seedy dive, so you don't have to bathe in Purell afterwards, but it's beautifully old school.  I've been there after a show at Amos' Southend or in the middle of an all day beer crawl and no matter what it's consistent and comfortable.  They even have popcorn as a free snack which is a million times more sanitary than beer nuts (just remember to use the scoop, you drunk bastards).  I'm happy that places like the Gin Mill are still around. Unpretentious, relaxed bars that let you enjoy a beer and forget about the outside world.",

You don't even know you have the drunk munchies until you smell it and then it is game over. Munch away.  Let me put my imaginary popcorn down for a moment to talk about the rest of the bar. We walked over to this place after our whirlwind South End brewery tour.  We went to the bar and my companion ordered a whiskey and I ordered a beer. The bar had a really good selection and the interior was clean. Though the bar was crowded the bartender was quick and efficient. Prices weren't bad either.   After we got our drinks we headed to the rooftop. We passed patrons playing all sorts of games which gave the bar a nice laid back feel.  Not a bad view when we got to the top but not a lot of seating and it was definitely busy around 10pm on a weekend. While there was some variety the majority of the patrons looked about like what you would see at a college frat party.   It was a fun bar and I look forward to returning the next time I am in the area.",

Towards the end of the night we decided to check out the patio upstairs. We went upstairs and realized it was dead. Once we decided it wasn't fun we decided to leave. My sister and I were leaving when one of the bouncers stopped us. He said we couldn't leave because \"we came in from the downstairs\". We had been there for about an hour and a half. He wouldn't even let us exit. Regardless if they were trying to kick us out, they wouldn't even let us leave the upstairs patio. We were very frustrated because we were just trying to get to our uber that was waiting for us upstairs. The bouncer upstairs went and got the downstairs bouncer before letting us go. We asked the downstairs bouncer what was going on and he said he didn't even know. He just escorted us out before even knowing the situation. It was a very stressful and frustrating time for me and the people I came with. We weren't even explain to why we're were being kicked out. The bouncer was very abrasive about the situation. We just wanted to know why we're we're being kicked out but he didn't even try to explain to us the situation. He just kept pushing my sister and I down the stairs. This was the worst experience I have ever had with a bar. I will never be returning.",

It requires lots of trips up and down, but it's still rather chill to be up there.  Corn hole, tables and chairs and a nice view still make it a nice hang out spot.  Good thing the downstairs has not changed much.  Plenty to do with darts, foosbal table, bar, complementary popcorn!, shuffle board table (actually one that works!).  There was a live band playing that Saturday night and they really rocked it.  Since I am getting older, I do appreciate less bar craziness and different types of entertainment (other than getting ridiculously drunk).  I guess i spent my 20somethings doing the majority of that and my liver always reminds me that i cannot do that anymore.  The Gin Mill offers a place with more substance and quality crowd (even tho we are older! There's totally nothing wrong with that).",

Fast, efficient and friendly. Picking up abandoned empties and serving out drinks quickly. Impressive.  Bouncer at the door checking ID's. Taxi stand outside ready to take the wobbly folks home, but I was good.

While I personally think the rooftop is significant better and I very much enjoy hanging out there, if you don't get there early, they won't let you up as they have a cap on people. While this is helpful to keep it from getting too busy, it makes you almost not want to leave the rooftop in fear you won't get back up. Eliminates the possibility of walking around the place or meeting up with friends on the rooftop. While this is still a fun place, it is not the place I use to know and love.",

The place will be packed and they will have live music. The food isn't anything to write home about but you could do worse for a sports bar. Plenty of TVs so not a bad place to catch an early game or spend a football Sunday. Overall I think I'm just too much older at this point to enjoy this type of night life but it certainly has its place. Serious about the line though at peak hours it is usually longer than anything I've seen at a Charlotte bar aside from maybe Roxbury.",

AND get this, the food is really good. That's what I'm actually here to review, because y'all, a bar is a bar. This one has a rooftop so add some brownie points. BUT THE FOOD! I ordered this drunkenly one night thinking it would work for the time being but it was so good, I ordered it on postmates SOBER a week later. The pimento fritters are greasy and amazingly tasty. The chicken tenders are so yummy and flavorful. The ranch is definitely homemade and you'll want to dip everything in it.",

In house chef (not from the bar next door) and a far better line up. They are also taking suggestions and continuing to tweak the menu to improve since reopening which is great to see. Same great service from Holly and Stephen. Only downside is that it can get EXTREMELY busy on the weekends now, where before you were almost always guaranteed a spot at the bar. But kudos to them for the success. The wings are, now, some of the best in Charlotte. The flatbreads are on point. Even the pickle appetizer is good!",

    "text": "Gin Mill is located in one of my favorite areas of Charlotte - South End! A mix of bars, clubs, and restaurants that is just minutes from the Epicenter but filled with young millennials looking for great food and fun. Walking into Gin Mill, you'll see a mix of high top tables, booths, and bar stools surrounding simple and spacious all wood designs. I came in with friends for brunch on the a Sunday of CIAA. We were starving from a long night of fun and looking for a great meal for a great price. The brunch menu is simple but has a little something for everyone- only missing something sweet like French toast or pancakes. I got the ham and cheese omelette with fries, and other in my group got things ranging from salad, wings, to shrimp and grits. My omelette was filled to the brim with great ingredients - fresh peppers, onions, ham, very cheesy, etc. During my time the kitchen was really backed up causing us to get our food pretty late, but Matt the manager, explained everything to us and truly put us first with any problems we had, which we truly appreciated. The staff handled the situation with the back-up of the kitchen great and I would definitely return, but if they could get mimosas down to 1/2$ a glass or bottles of champagne/carafes to 15/16$ i would give 5 stars!",

The layout of the Gin Mill is so well thought out - they have placed the bar, dance area, tables, and restrooms in a way that flows very well. The DJ was rocking, and they had the windows open to let the spring, air inside. Customers are mostly 22-30 range in age, and dressed casually (jeans to dresses are fine). This place is well located in South End, and is a great place to spend a fun night out. Bar prices are reasonable, and they don't have a cover!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner for Charlotte burger week. None of us had ever been here, so we were excited to try it out- especially since we are all huge burger enthusiasts.  To start out parking was super confusing. There were a few parking lots but it seemed that none of them were designated for Gin Mill. So it took us a while to find parking, we were not anticipating that.  After we eventually found parking, we walked in and  were greeted promptly by the hostess. She was awesome, super friendly and came over a few times while we were seated.  Service from our waitress, however, was different. We hardly saw her except to order our drinks, food and pay. I didn't get a refill the whole time. I'm very understanding with restaurants and how they are busy, but they weren't busy when we were there.  As far as the food, the $6 burger week special was the mill burger (normally $10) it was a decent burger. Was it the best burger I ever had? No. Was it horrible? No. It was over cooked, so it was not juicy (how I like my burgers) and had more char on the outside than I prefer. On the description of the burger it said it had bacon on it, although I didn't taste any bacon, unless it was mixed in with the abundance of pimento cheese on the burger.   After we finished eating, I got my waitresses attention to place a Togo order for my boyfriend. I told her I wanted to get him one of the mill burgers as well. So she puts it in then brings out the check and I notice that there is one for $6 on there and one for $10 on there. I asked why it was $10 and she said for the special it is dine in. I politely told her that I wasn't aware of that and if she could please take it off. She said the kitchen had already started cooking it. To which I said, I didn't know it wasn't for $6, had I known that, I wouldn't have ordered that. I would have let my boyfriend pick up food on his own (I didn't want to spend $10 on a burger he was gonna eat an hour later that wasn't going to be hot and not as great). So after a few minutes she finally told me she could give me the special price. But she made it seem like she was doing me a favor. And it just really gave me the bad vibe and tried to make it like I was trying to pull one over. But my thing is if there are 3 people at the table and they all order the special burger and they order 1 Togo and you can't get it for that price Togo, you should probably say something.  So because of the parking situation, the overcooked burger, and the waitress I don't think we will be back again.",

I have actually never eaten IN this restaurant, I've gotten it delivered twice via postmates (which I hate using because my order is never right) and both times the orders were prepared with love and consideration and were exactly right (even thought I special order almost everything). From a high maintenance eater, who was expecting subpar bar food that wasn't crispy or correct due to postmating, I'm beyond impressed and surprised by the food quality. This place must be operating with a legitimate chef who cares about the product and the customer. Bravo! I will absolutely be a regular customer moving forward.",

We stayed longer than I had thought we would. We were planning on bar hopping..but Around 9 I noticed that it looked like a band was setting up to play. The bartender informed me that they have live music every Friday and Saturday night... I don't know very much about quality of bands, but they were great! Within an hour or so I realized the vibe had changed and there was a long line out the door.. (get there before 10pm). I will absolutely be back! Gotta do a girls night there.. oh and they had roof top bar too, with a view of the city.. I totally took a selfie...",
