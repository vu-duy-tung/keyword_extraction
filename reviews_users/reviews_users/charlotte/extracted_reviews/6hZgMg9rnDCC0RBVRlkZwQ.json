Ordered Seaweed Salad, vegetable tempura, rainbow roll, 2 Tuna Sushi, spicy tuna and Crazy roll. I was most impressed with the tuna Sushi because it was not a thin slice of tuna on top of sushi rice. It was a nice thick piece. The vegetable tempura was great. Nice and hot and very crispy. Seaweed salad was delicious and was on top of a bed of julienned cucumbers. The other rolls were just a delicious but one item I didn't get was the Spicy tuna roll but instead got a California roll. That didn't bother me as much. For the price, it was well worth the food and service received. I would highly recommend trying this place.",

    "text": "Let's see, where to begin...  For starters, I have been to this restaurant more times in the last year than anywhere else. Why? They are an all you can eat, made to order sushi restaurant that is serving up some seriously good rolls, hibachi, and appetizers at a seriously good price. The staff is always friendly and quick and did I mention it is all you can eat? I believe I've subconsciously been avoiding writing this review to try and keep this spot quiet, however I'm pretty sure the word is out.  Previously, my only gluttonous experiences with sushi were related to Rusans, which is certainly a different atmosphere. Here you get a check card when you sit down and they will make your sushi/apps/hibachi to order. A few pro tips:  - Order everything you want at once. The place is always busy so it will take a bit to get to you.  - Don't order solely with your stomach. It's a lot of food and they can charge you for what you don't finish.  - Personal preference here, but don't order too many fried rolls. They really sit heavy. Some of my favorite rolls include the White Tiger, Rainbow, and Carolina.  - If with a large group, get them to put all the sushi rolls on one plate for impressive presentations and optimal sharing   I personally think you get more bang for your buck at lunch ($12) as you still get an expansive menu. It will take more than an hour to do (depending on the drive) and you will want to get there early. Dinner is also good ($17) and includes more items and sushi than what you will find at lunch. While I'm still scratching my head at how they make a profit, I look forward to continuing to work through their menu!",

    "text": "I needed to start working on my \"restaurants I still need to try\" bucket list for 2016, and since I was in Pineville checking out a car off craigslist, I figured no better time to try #1 on my list, Mr. Tokyo. I was fully aware of the AYCE offering and I was more than ready for the challenge. You sit down to a check list and some golf pencils to make your selections. I ordered agedashi tofu, miso soup, avocado salad, 1 piece of salmon nigiri, vegetable tempura, and the snow white roll. I thought I had accidentally ordered too much but I guess I was hungry because I managed to finish it all without any problem.    Anywho, on to the food. The agedashi tofu came out with a nice small amount but it could have been a bit crispier and served with a little more of the dashi. The miso was the sweet shiro miso variety and was alright, but I probably won't get this next time, it was the only thing I didn't finish. The avocado salad was great, and came topped with a slightly sweet carrot ginger dressing, my favorite. The salmon was wonderfully fresh, I will order more things with salmon on my next visit. I ordered the vegetable tempura, craving a little something fried, forgetting that I had already ordered the age tofu but I sure am glad I did. It came out piping hot with a superbly crispy and thin batter. Super good but the serving was a bit too generous and took up a little too much precious stomach real estate. Finally, there was the snow white roll. I struggled to decide between this one and a spicy one, but the cute little waitress said this was her favorite so I decided to try it. I will say she did warn me that it was sweet, and indeed it did turn out to be a little sweeter than I would have liked, and definitely too heavily sauced, but the ingredient all tasted super fresh so I can't judge too harshly. I just wish it was a half sized roll instead a full size so that I could have tried more than one.    As far as the service it was super attentive, if not a bit too much so. The table next to me might have craved a little more attention from our waitress but we got to chatting about Japan, Korean dramas, and Taipei (where the waitress was from) after she noticed I pronounced \"age\" in the age tofu correctly....you know, it happens. Everyone was very friendly and the food came out quickly and hot when necessary. Next time I will bring a friend along so that I can try more things on the menu. Note that the price for the lunch has gone up to 11.99 for adults. Still a steal if you ask me. Please mow down RuSans and put a Mr. Tokyo in its place so that its closer to me....a girl can dream.",

They also have other things than sushi in case someone in your group would rather eat chicken. The ambiance is nice and there are plenty of seats and parking up front.   I highly recommend this place and will always return here to eat AYCE sushi.",

I ordered a few diff types of nigiri (squid, octopus, and tamago), the agedashi tofu, crab rangoon, BBQ squid, and 2 rolls (Mr Tokyo and Snow White roll). My favorite roll was the Snow White by far. I didn't realize they used chopped fish for the spicy tuna/spicy salmon mixes and I don't care for the texture personally. Other than that everything I ordered was amazing! I'll certainly be going back even though I live 30 min away. One word of advice is that they charge for wasting food if you don't finish it. We didn't have a problem with this since we all did the \"all you can eat\" option and helped each other finish any leftovers, but it's good to know while ordering.",

Menu selection - there were so many choices from basic to specialty rolls. Several soup and appetizer options as well as hibachi dishes for the non-sushi lovers.

Who does that? The manager was very unprofessional, rude, and couldn't even say anything to us.  We still ended up waiting an additional 15 minutes for our table. Those who decide to go there, just make sure that they have your \"name\" down CORRECTLY to avoid this issue especially when you're driving about 30-40 minutes just to get screwed over on seatings.",

This isn't like some of the other places that just do AYCE sushi for lunch with small skimpy rolls, this my friends is the real deal. Please BRING YOUR APPETITE!     I never thought an AYCE place would have some of the best sushi in Charlotte but it does. I feel like I just ghosted New Zealand cafe and Umai.....   If you are a sushi lover put this on your must try list. You will never find a better deal, AYCE for the price of one or two rolls anywhere else. The rolls are fresh, made to order and are regular size. They don't hold back, they have regular rolls (I'm never dissapointed with their spicy tuna), but they offer a variety of specialty rolls as well. The Phoenix Maki is a favorite of mine that you can get any time of the day. But the best rolls are on the dinner menu that is priced at 16.99 and you can't go wrong. Do yourself a favor and try the Sweet Heat roll and the Charlotte roll.... sooo good!  Now I'm hungry.....",

Usually his appetite would mean a $100 sushi bill- and we are trying to ball on a budget with a new baby.  We were sat right away in the perfect location- the corner- away from the hoopla of a busy restaurant.  The server came right away, and we put in our drink orders.  There is a strip of booths and a ton of tables in the middle of the room.  It's tight in there, and it's not a large place.  We soon after put in our appetizer and sushi order.  Then we waited.....and waited.....and waited.  One of our appetizers was seaweed salad.  That was not brought out until I asked for it.  It took over 30 minutes to get out sushi.  Pretty sure it was closer to 45.  We were both getting very impatient- and the server never even apologized until the food actually came out.  The stars are because the sushi was good.  The 3 missing is because my hanger was real that night.  Once we got the sushi, we liked it- but it was such a slow and bad experience, I'm not sure we will be back.  Lunch price is $10.95, dinner $17.95 just FYI.",

TIP: The Mr. Tokyo Bowl is an appetizer limited to one per person. Get one for every person in your party and filch from your friends. It's excellent.",

    "text": "Lunch on a Thursday you would think they would have their service together a bit more.  The place was pretty empty yet we stood at the door for a few minutes waiting to be acknowledged by the staff. Once we were seated the lady instantly went into describing how to order, maybe this is my Type-A coming out, but I don't care to be bombarded with information when I first sit down. The concept seemed self explanatory and the paper menu you handed me has directions written. When I was a teacher my pet-peeve was explaining stuff that was clearly written, so maybe that is why I was annoyed, but not a good start.   We ordered a few rolls, salads, and hibachi. The timing of the oder was completely off, one salad came out. I watched my dining partner eat, I also watched my salad sit on the sushi bar for a good 10 minutes. I finally asked if I could get my salad and my waiter told me that they lost the ticket. There was a huge wait for the rest of the food and once they delivered the sushi we didn't have napkins, chopsticks, soy sauce, or ramekins for the sauce. - Seriously bad service at this point.   The sushi was ok for what it was, $12 for ACYE sushi....you can't expect something too high end. I will say one of my rolls had tuna or salmon that was not deboned properly, there were several bones in the roll and one actually got stuck in my throat for a few hours. Oh and one roll was so smothered in some mayo based sauce it was completely inedible.   Meh - better ACYE sushi places with better service.",

Our food came out quickly I had the crab Rangoon's , spring rolls, salmon roll, tuna roll and The Miami roll and Teriyaki shrimp which came with rice and veggies! I ate during lunch and the price is $12.99.  The servers were friendly. Unless you are seated at a booth you will have to share a table with other people which wasn't a problem to me. I wish that there was a more diverse menu for the chef special rolls. I don't like imitation crab in my sushi rolls and almost all of the special rolls have imitation crab.  Also I'm not a big fan of sushi rolls with cream cheese most of the chef special rolls have either or both. So I just got Miami roll because there was no crab and I just pushed the majority of the cream cheese out with my chopstick. This is more of a preference. I would definitely come back again. All in all I had a great experience I will be back",

Chef got both of those requests wrong!  One was an allergy, so had to get the chef to remake.  It was hard to get the food down this time so that we weren't charged additional fees.

We both did the AYCE sushi, which really is the best value, because signature rolls were $12 each, and it was all freshly prepared as we ordered. Be prepared for a short wait (10 min.), they move everyone along, never rushing, but it's a popular spot.   We started with the crab rangoons and spring rolls, which were both just OK. The Rangoon filling was sweet, and the spring roll didn't have much filling to it at all. The rolls were delicious and they definitely didn't skimp on the size or filling. We ordered the sweet potato roll, angel hair roll, sweet heat roll and sweet tornado roll. All four were equally amazing, but the angel hair and sweet heat were my two favorites. We also ordered the squid, which definitely is meant for a sharing table of 4, and that was decent. A little rubbery, but not bad, it was more the BBQ smoke was over powering.",

    "text": "Good price, all you can eat. Rolls are pretty good. Cooked food is all pretty good. Definitely above par for an AYCE sushi place. And unlike most AYCE sushi/Japanese, they make everything on demand, so yes you wait a little longer, but it's ALWAYS fresh.   Everything on the cooked side is decent to good. Highlights on the cooked side are the hibachi style udon, fried gyoza, pickled octopus salad, and fried spring rolls. They're good enough to actually eat just that.   The fish is good, on par with most of the better places in Charlotte, and certainly well above the median. Rolls are inventive, and again, most importantly, FRESHLY MADE.   Does tend to get crowded, and their success is definitely deserved.",

We ordered 1 roll at a time yo make sure not to waste any. I only got through 2 rolls & 2 appetizers.  The spring rolls were delicious- BUT very little filling. It's mostly wrapper Gyoza - although the were delicious it was VERY oily/greasy Panther roll is SPICY. Oh my !! Come with several hungry people & everyone order something different & share, because the rolls are cut 8-9 pieces. This way you get to try more items before you're full!  You can order off regular menu- but no sharing of the AYCE items others get.  Would love to come back & try more items.",

Lots of appetizers, rolls, soups, etc. My main complaint is that there are not a lot of nigiri or sashimi options on the AYCE menu. I realize I may be alone in this, but I do really enjoy having some plain nigiri when I do all you can eat. Anyway:  The fish has been fresh at both experiences. The food comes out relatively quickly. The wait time is minimal! I mean, it is crowded and busy, but I've been sat pretty quickly both times.   I really recommend you looking at the menu and if you see a few things (or a dozen) that you'd like to try, do it!",

    "text": "Fried cheesecake was delicious . We ordered 2 of them after we ate the unlimited hibachi/sushi dinner. It was $18.99 for adults and $10.99 for kids under 10. We got the steak hibachi (tender and juicy) and A LOT of the shrimp tempura. We had least 10 orders of them (3 per order). The rice has vinegar in it, so don't expect regular white rice. They don't offer it. The udon takes FOREVER, but its decent and very chunky. The gyozas are a little on the almost burnt side, but still good. The dipping sauce was kind of spicy. I had ordered the vegetables tempura and asked for the sweet potato only. When I got the order, they just gave me two pieces. You will have to be very specific since they go by what is written on the sheet of paper you filll out to order. Your food comes out as soon as they are done cooking it, which I love. Come here hungry because you will be charged if there are any leftovers and you can't take it home. Service is okay, just depends on who is serving you. Plenty of parking, cushy seats, and a cute sushi statue to take pics of while you wait to be seated.",

They need to let you share appetizers in my opinion but hey thats just me.  The seaweed salad is some of the best I've ever had.  The nigiri is good but I wished they had some of the fish options from dinner on the menu including sashimi.    The tuna is some of the best in town.  They need to work on the nigiri as the rice is either not sticky enough or it is not prssed well. It's hard enough to pick up with chopsticks in this state let along dip into a soy sauce/wasabi sludge.  The red shore clam and flying fish egg roe nigiri is absolute fire. Their roe is super fresh and full of flavor, and crunchy.  Sometimes the wait is long and seating waits are outside the door during peak luncb times so get there early.  The talent serving you is pretty good. Make sure you tip they work hard.  Every appetizer is fire. Especially the tofu.  Never left here disappointed and hopefully when I go for dinner one day this will become a 5 star.  Actually it is a 5 star. If you door dash you can order off menu and request dinner options.",

    "text": "I came here again, but I brought with me my entire family this time (4 people total), and we were all ravenous. We came for dinner, and I think they raised the price to $17.99 per person. I recommend ordering on one slip of paper first and then throughout the meal adding more as necessary on the other sheets.   We tried some appetizers, including the seaweed salad (good, pretty standard), the avocado salad (sliced avocado on top of iceberg lettuce with some ginger(?) dressing), and the age tofu (hot, deep fried cubes of silken tofu- would recommend). We also tried the Mr. Tokyo bowl, which was a way tinier portion than expected but definitely get it if you like salmon (but it's limited to one per person).  Next, we tried the hibachi with beef, shrimp, and vegetables with a side of rice. I'd say this was pretty standard as well; I'd probably save room for the sushi if you were planning to order sushi. We also tried the udon, which isn't in a soup and was just okay.  Finally, the sushi!! We ordered the Mr. Tokyo roll, crazy roll, dynamite roll, phoenix maki roll, lemon salmon roll, snow white roll, and the volcano roll. With the exception of the lemon salmon roll, they were all either fried and/or drenched in some sort of sauce. They do offer the more traditional rolls and nigri/sashimi as well. I would definitely recommend the Phoenix maki roll and the Mr. Tokyo roll - they had the best flavor. Overall, the rolls didn't have super thick cuts of fish, but it was enough, and they didn't try to stuff the rolls with rice, which was a relief.   Service was great, our glasses were never empty and food was brought to our table promptly after being made.",

Pros: AYCE sushi includes specialty rolls, appetizers, hibachi, kids menu, and classic/hand rolls. They have the most options I've ever seen for AYCE. The quality of the food was great too! Service was friendly and helpful.   Cons: The poor waitress seemed to be working all the tables by herself, but she did a great job at keeping up. The sanitation score is 92, which is pretty low for my standards, but I enjoyed the food regardless.   I will definitely be taking the 30 minute drive to return! Just be sure not to order more than you can eat, or you will hate yourself for shoving sushi down your throat to avoid additional charges.",

This popped up with great reviews and thought I would give it a try. They actually offer all-you-can-eat sushi, appetizers, dessert, fried rice, and so much more I can't even list. The food was delicious. And the staff was so attentive and my food came out within a few minutes. I think this is probably the best sushi value in Charlotte. I will definitely be back with my wife. Highly recommended.",

The price is so right (honestly, I think they should raise their prices!) and the quality is phenomenal. It's an AYCE style restaurant but you can also order a la carte. It really doesn't make sense not to do the AYCE option. Sushi lovers will be able to indulge in specialty rolls and sushi, while people who prefer their food cooked will have plenty of options too.   The service is friendly and attentive. Just remember to eat all the food you order. They will charge you for any waste.   Beware: The restaurant can get very busy but it is worth the wait!",

There was a man sitting at the table next to us who told his server he couldn't eat one of the rolls because he didn't like the sauce. He said he tried to make himself eat it but just couldn't do it. He asked not to be charged for not eating it. (He was extremely nice about it) The female manager came over and insisted he would be charged but offered him a box (he didn't like it). They started to argue and she threatened to call the police, all because he didn't want to be charged for something he didn't like. If we had not had put our order in already we would have left. I worked in restaurants for over 12 years, and have never seen anything like it. I'm boycotting this place.",

    "text": "This place was SO good.   The only problem we had was that my husband ordered 4 pieces of sashimi (an extra .50 each) and he only received 2. We thought the other 2 pieces would come out after, since everything seemed staggered, and we mentioned that we didn't get some of our order and our server told us that he did get sashimi because of the garnish on the plate. We weren't saying we didn't get it, we just didn't 2 pieces of the squid sashimi, yet we were still charged for it. Since it was only $1 we didn't push it, but if you order sashimi, make sure you get it before you start eating.    However, with that small issue aside, the food was great. The rolls were very big and very fresh. The quality was excellent. The service was also great and our server removed dishes and filled our water glasses frequently. The BBQ squid was a bit overcooked for my taste, but my husband liked it.   Overall, we will definitely come back. You can't beat $17 for the selection and quality of food they have.",

Arriving at the venue you enter into a wide room with a sushi bar to your right and a series of tables and booths, nicely decorated and very clean, we were sat at a table where out waiter explained the menu to us, basically you have a wide selection of Sushi, nigiri, sashimi, rolls salads and some BBQ.  For our first round we ordered some tempura shrimp, aged tofu, yellowtail and jalapeno and BBQ Squid, I won't review the squid more than saying it was delicious and really a jaw dropper.  Everything was delicious.  We ordered some rolls next and same nigiri, the nigiri was the quality of other places in charlotte that charge premium price, there is a up charge for sashimi that may seem odd but the slices of fish are much larger than would be expected.  The rolls were great, we sampled a few and except for a slightly overcooked Dynamite roll there were well made, well flavoured and beautiful to look at.  The only thing i don't understand is how this place is not absolutely packed all the time.",

The miso soup I ordered had a chlorine/tap water aftertaste, and the portions were full-sized so you can only order a few items during your visit. There was nothing special about the fish nor the sushi. Do not order the BBQ squid appetizer unless you are sharing amongst many people because they give you a giant whole squid. I have been to similar places that are cheaper, do not charge as much for leftovers, and have smaller portions with better quality. I felt like I was being punished having to eat the food with my family. We were excited to try this place, but we will not be returning.",

My boyfriend hates fish, so he orders the hibachi and appetizers. This is not your typical buffet where the menu items have been sitting out for who knows how long!

    "text": "I found Mr. Tokyo on yelp and being a fan of Japanese, I decided to take my lunch partner there for lunch today.  We had a little trouble finding the place because it's in a tight corner of a busy shopping center on Pineville Matthews Road.  It's the shopping center with the new Walmart neighborhood market and the Staples in it.  We were honestly giving up on locating it but found it at the last minute.  Once inside I was happily surprised to find that it was crowded.  The decor is soothing, I liked their choice of chair, above average.  They have an odd business model:  it's all you care to eat - but not a buffet at all.  You order your food (habachi or sushi) and they'll continue bringing you refills of what you ordered.  But if you leave food on your plate, they upcharge a nominal fee for the waste.  It's an odd way to do business, but I appreciate the thought behind it so we embraced it.  I ordered teriyaki chicken for my first visit, usually a safe bet.  My lunch partner ordered the same with a cucumber salad and an order of spring rolls.  The \"Cucumber\" salad is the basic iceberg lettuce salad with cucumbers and ginger dressing that you're used to getting at Japanese places.  I wasn't expecting it to be called cucumber salad, so didn't order any salad at all.  (To me, in the south when you say cucumber salad, you're ordering marinated cucumbers, tomatoes and onions served cold as a side dish)    The food arrived quickly and it was both visually appealing and tasty.  The rice wasn't dry and the chicken was actual chicken.  I was full after one plate so didn't need to order more of anything.  The lunch price is $10.99 which I thought was reasonable for what they offered.  The sushi looked good, but I'm not a huge sushi gal, and certainly not on the first visit, but I think I'll try it next time  :-)",

I've been back a few times since on weekdays and it's never busy and service is always perfect.   Every server that I've had has been very courteous and always keeps drinks filled and food coming. I never have to wait long when ordering, even for multiple rolls.  I am picky about the rolls I eat, and I have found several here that I found l definitely like. Also I like that I can get salads, appetizers, habachi, noodles, etc in addition to a great selection of sushi. I love also that's it's all made to order and I don't have to wait in a line to pick old food off a buffet.   This place has become one of my favorite sushi places in Charlotte.",

Waitress was nice and helpful, they also have a  buffet and a  regular menu. The one catch is if you order stuff from the buffet menu, and you don't finish it, the charges you extra for it, that's the only bad thing I can say about it. Beside that I would definitely recommend this place to eat.",

Our server was attentive and helpful.  This was our first time and she patiently explained it to us.  I also ordered the crab Rangoon which had good flavor as well, but I'd skip it next time to enjoy more sushi.  I also appreciate the civic mindedness of this restaurant and will continue to dine there.  Our favorites were Deep Blue, Crazy Girl - which had some heat- and crazy Tiger.  Really every roll was delicious.",

In the previous times we had the option to be added to the waiting list OR the bar which is a first come first serve. Well that was not the case tonight. It was an hour to be sat so I told my wife let's just go and sit at the bar since it's a first come first serve bases. Well as I sit the hots comes to me and tells me I can not sit since the bar was requested.. I looked at her and told her to my understanding the bar is a first come first serve. She agreed with me it is but we couldn't sit there since they were requested by someone who was ahead of me already. I looked at her and question how this works because to my understanding any other restaurant the rule applies but not in Mr.Tokyo?? We spoke with the manager and of course we got the same response. A horrible way to end my dine out with my wife and sadly to say we will no longer go back to Mr.Tokyo. All we ask of you is please get your seating policies clear!",

I've given this place chances after chances . First off,  servers are nice  for the most part but they tend to forget to put in our orders and would put it in towards then end knowing we would be full by then . I would not mind if you forget, but don't wait towards the end of our meal. We wouldn't have ordered more if they had  not forgot. They expect  u to literally finish everything including what they never put in the first place. We asked if we can bring it home , but they refused to let us . I understand they been having the policy of charging leftovers, but it should not be on us if it's the  employees fault.  And secondly, I can't stand the little Asian lady in the front, every single time I'm here I never had a pleasant talk with her. She's supposedly the manager but she talks to me like I owe her something but everyone else is always nice . That is 100% the reason why I hate coming to this spot . Hate it!",

    "text": "I forgot to tell you that I ordered off the dinner menu.   And it was wonderful.   If you go in for lunch on the weekends, they give you the dinner menu. Dinner is priced at $16.99 for all you can eat, fresh, made to order sushi and various items - there is still hibachi for the ones that don't love sushi, don't fret. Whenever special things are saved for a dinner menu, I try to order those so that I don't miss out on anything. On this menu, among other things, you'll find the Charlotte roll, Sweet Heat roll and the TOKYO BOWL (this one is in the sushi appetizer section). The Tokyo Bowl should definitely be the one that you kick your meal off with - it's fresh, large slices of salmon wrapped around crab salad and tobiko. Its amazing. And I really think that you should do it in one bite - just do it. Report back. Don't choke. (Safety first). The Charlotte Roll and Sweet Heat Rolls are probably two of my favorites - Phoenix Maki is very good too, but available on the lunch menu. I usually get the spring rolls though, available on the lunch menu - they're really good. The nigiri list is much longer on the dinner menu too - definitely get the tuna and salmon.   I'm going to stick with my warning in the first review too - these are all very large rolls, do not over order. Order one at a time if you have to, take your time. They will charge you for wasted food. DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS RULE. You are warned when you sit down, Yelp has warned you, get it together. This is a glorious rule, I wish more restaurants would use it. Wasted food is not a good thing, don't do it. If you ignore all of the above warnings, then take your leftovers home and graciously pay the extra. You weren't raised in a barn.   I love this place. I will continue to come here, far more often then one actually should. Dating Tip: If you really want to test out a new date, take her here - if she says that she loves sushi and only orders one roll, she is not the one. I'm sorry, I know its a tough rule - but I feel like I'm helping you out. This place is amazing. The end.",

I find this system to be super democratic and American, not to mention very entertaining.    The sushi is really just okay, but the fact that you pay less than $20 and eat like 6 rolls and some dumplings is really quite amazing.  I only come here with my cousin, and it's a good time.    If your thinking about eating there, do get there early, because I've had to wait about 15-20 minutes the few times I've gone.  Its a busy establishment and because it's an all you can eat system, tables don't turn over quickly.    I'm giving Mr. Tokyo's 5 stars on the basis that people should try it out and play the game of \"how much can I really eat?\"",

Everything went well and it is all you can eat sushi. Make sure you finish all your sushi or else they will charge you for extras (read the fine print).    Try the salmon, Mr.  Tokyo Bowl and appetizers.  This is the number 1 spot close to Pineville to have the best and fresh sushis.  (I hope their workers get paid over time for making so many sushi ;) )   For vegans/vegetarians they have other options as well.  Tofu, edamame, fish and miso soup. Also, Hibachi rice with vegetables.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Mr. Tokyo... I have been hearing good things!  Usually when I hear \"all you can eat sushi\" I sort of cringe and remember bad experiences of buffet style sushi that is not very good and really just betting on volume more than quality.  So this place is actually LEGIT.... they ask you to finish your orders before ordering more (so no wasting is allowed... neither is sharing).  Everything is made to order.  As soon as you walk in, you see the army of sushi chefs behind the counter furiously filling orders.  Note:  They won't seat you until your entire party is present.  There was six of us and there were plenty of seats (large tables available).  I thought it was a little awkward to wait, but I get the policy.  I'm usually the person that gets to the place first and sits at the table while everyone else trickles in.  There is a very tiny waiting area.... our entire party of six filled up the one bench they had in front of the hostess stand.  Once we got seated the magical paper menu appeared and we were given a quick run-through on how everything works.  Our server, Nick, was super nice and he was always back checking with us if we wanted to order more and take away our plates.  I'm definitely a fan.  Their specialty rolls were very tasty and beautiful to look at... and their standard fare is great as well.  I usually judge a place by their spicy tuna roll... and it is excellent here.    So this place is tucked away in a shopping center.  Maybe it's because I went to high school just down the road, but it does feel weird making the trip to Pineville and seeing this same shopping center, but with just different business tenants.  At one point there was a Dairy Queen where I used to hang out here.... but it's long gone.  If you aren't a fan of driving...con your friend into carpooling and enjoying some sushi.",

The service is fast and the sushi is fresh. If you're not familiar with Mr. Tokyo it's an AYCE hibachi and sushi restaurant. I can't vouch for the hibachi as I've never had it, but their sushi is pretty bomb. And the best part is that it's NOT a buffet. The sushi is made fresh and made to order. And for $18 a person for dinner you really can't beat it.  For starters I always get a spring roll and the Mr. Tokyo bowl, which is limited one per person. The Mr. Tokya bowl is spicy crab goodness wrapped in salmon and it's dynamite! It's a must order every time.   My husband and I usually split 5 speciality rolls (woof I know) here and our favorites are the Panther roll (which I didn't see on the menu last time- sadness) and the Snow White roll. The Sweet Heat roll is also a personal favorite with avocado and spicy tuna.   Since the release of the Charlotte Agenda article on this place they have been packed so make sure you come ready to wait on the weekends. However, their bar (sits 4) is open on a first come- first served basis. We sat up there once and it was fine- better than waiting an hour.",

The restaurant is in a strip mall, but we have had many yummy sushi dinners in strip malls, so we didn't care about that.   We did have to wait 40 minutes to get a table, so I was really excited about the rolls. Once we were seated, our waitress was very attentive and sweet. We ordered 4 rolls since they do All-You-Can-Eat for one price. This is great if you can eat a lot of sushi, but if you only want one or two rolls, it's not worth it. It was decent sushi, but not the greatest I've ever had. I wouldn't make the trip down to Pineville just to go here again.",

They have a more limited selection of sushi for the dinner buffet, which is strange because you pay more for dinner. So we just make sure to get there for lunch, so we can get our favorite rolls! Angel hair and the Miami roll are our favorites. But they also have delicious spring rolls and teriyaki chicken so there is a good selection for the whole family! Service is mostly good but you have to ask for your check, otherwise they won't give it to you. We recently waited 40 minutes after eating for our check, we found out our waiter had gone to break and didn't have anyone cover him. I won't take a point off because their food is so delicious and worth the wait! ButWill definitely continue to come back!",

When I visited the restaurant and settled down on the table, they refused to follow their own advertised price stating that the advertised price is not applicable on weekend. If that's the case, they should have clarified it (that the price not valid on weekends) at least somewhere on the full A4 size paper advertisement. Other stand they took is that the price menu is provided prior to ordering the food and have choice to go somewhere else. Seems to be unfair to give that option to customers when they travel from long distance with family based on the misleading advertisement. Hope the management stop misleading advertisement.",

If you are looking for quantity to fill your stomach and not the experience of quality food, you will do well. Its not just the size of the sushi pieces that was disappointing, it was the tasteless mushy, consistent with low grade, old or frozen (too long) fish. Everything tastes the same, moosh requiring soy sauce to add flavor.  The tempura shrimp was a frozen breaded shrimp or breaded mystery fish coated with overdone crusty breading (no flavor), gyoza dumplings were right out of the bag and into the fryer (signs of freezer burn) , agedashi tofu was gummy, sauces were watered down and tasteless, even the wasabi.

Two weeks ago came and my boyfriend didn't even get his meal til after I had my full meal and the check came out. Came tonight the hostess wrote our name down and said it would be twenty minutes and told her we would wait at the bar. Twenty minutes later saw she gave a two top table to customers who just walked in. Called her out on it and got blank stares. Talked to manager. No empathy nor did he offer any sort of compensation. Very disappointed in the staff and customer service for a place that does have great food and drinks. Please look into a better system for waiting customers.",

    "text": "I have been to Mr. Tokyo twice now and really love this place! All You Can Eat sushi for both lunch and dinner. I feel like the lunch AYCE is such an amazing deal as its like $11!   On my most recent trip, a group of us went for lunch. I ordered dumplings and 3 specialty rolls. Yes, 3.....I wanted to die after but I finished them all! Next time I may just skip the appetizers and go straight to the rolls. My favorite roll was the Snow White roll. I also ordered a Dragon Roll. Forgot the last one but all 3 rolls were delish! They do have alot of deep fried rolls. Those aren't really my jam but if you are into deep fried rolls, they got em!  In addition to AYCE sushi, they do AYCE hibachi. I have had the hibachi on my first visit and thought it was super tasty and filling. I would say if you are just doing hibachi, order 2 as they are a smaller sized portion.   Note: They do charge you for uneaten food and the rolls are definitely not small. So, order wisely!",

They have some great rolls, just make sure to read all the description on what's included in the rolls to make sure you are ordering what you want.   Definitely get the house apps (salmon and yellowtail) that are only 1 order per person. They are 1 order per person for a reason! You can also get sashimi for extra .50 per piece - well worth it in my opinion.The apps are excellent - I always get the seaweed and calamari salad. Great choices.   Service speed is really slow - they don't have enough people making the rolls, and with the increase in popularity, demand far outpaces their speed. But when you do get the food, the quality is great.   Dessert selection is lacking, but if they have the mochi ice cream, i would recommend those as well.",

My co-worker and boss are a ton, so they thought it was the greatest thing ever. The only bad thing is the lack of a place to wait to be seated, even outside, and it's so loud that the servers are a bit hard to understand.",

They are different than a sushi buffet in that you sit down and put your order on little slips of paper that have all the sushi offerings. The waitress then takes the slip and the chefs make it for you fresh. I feel like this definitely results in better qualty sushi and they are very fast even though my boyfriend and I always order like three giant plates...haha...   There are appetizers, entrees, rolls, and nigiri you can choose from. Appetizers are pretty standard asian restaurant ones like edamame and crab rangoons. Entrees include hibachi. For rolls there are basic rolls and more elaborate rolls. You can ask for the basic rolls to be hand rolls, which is what I do! The nigiri is great and they have a wide selection. You can choose for any of the nigiri to be sashimi but it is an extra 25 cents.   Total is it $13/person for lunch and $18/person for dinner. They will charge you if you have leftovers.",

We were immediately seated, and given an explanation of how the menu work. It's all you can eat hibachi and sushi (yum). Adults $18.99 kids 6 years and under $7.99. Because I have a kid that's random with his appetite I don't think that was a good deal. However they also have a regular menu, but the prices would push you over to the all you can eat menu. To avoid being wasteful they have a policy if you don't eat the extra food you ordered you would be charged extra, but you can take it with you. The food was really good especially the sushi. I can't rave enough on how good it was. I would definitely recommend this restaurant but remember to go hungry. I wasn't that hungry so I was full offer eating sushi rolls.",

Mr. Tokyo, when guests walk into your door you need to have a hostess that greets them timely, not wait 5 minutes and have to speak up to even be acknowledged. Also, maybe recognize regulars, we come at least once a week and every time we are still asked if we have been there before. It's not that hard to recognize a weekly customer.",

With the AYCE sushi deal ($17.99 for dinner) you are able to indicate via paper and pencil which rolls, appetizers, nigiri, or even non-sushi dishes you want, as many times as you want. With their rolls being $12, it's a great deal! My boyfriend is not a sushi fan and there is plenty of variety with noodle bowls, appetizers, teriyaki, and hibachi (also all you can eat.)  The service is great- quick and friendly. They do a good job of checking in with you along the way to see if you want to order any additional food.  The food was very high quality as well, which is something that you don't often get at a AYCE or buffet place. I had the Miso Soup, Avocado Salad (the only thing that was slightly underwhelming), Yellowtail Appetizer, Salmon and Tuna Nigiri, and then split 6 rolls with a friend. My favorite roll was the Sweet Heat, but you really can't go wrong with any of the options.  This is my vote for the best sushi in Charlotte at the best value!",

    "text": "I've already went to this place three times in a month! It is pretty awesome for the price and selections. ($11.99 lunch and $17.99 dinner) It is an order off the menu, all you can eat Japanese Restaurant. You can also opt out of the buffet and just order off the menu. The good thing about this place is that all items are made fresh for you. We typically start out with appetizers. (Their crab ragoon is pretty good) then you will feel tempted to get a hibachi plate which is delicious! Try to share a plate. But just be warned to not ordered alot of sushi because you will be so full! My best advice is skip the hibachi or order only 2-3 sushi rolls if you are going to have it. They have a disclosure that you cannot waste food and they will charge .50 cents a pc for wasted sushi. The sushi is pretty good for the price you pay. Since they make the rolls fresh for you, you will not have to worry about the the being hard and stale from sitting out too long. I've already gotten my family, friends and co-workers addicted to this place!",

    "text": "Terrible!!! Against my better judgement, we tried out mr. Tokyo based on the glowing reviews. I normally stay away from buffets and all you can eat deals because the food is usually mediocre or terrible, but somehow we found ourselves here hoping for some good food...not looking for a deal. First warning sign was that it is not Japanese run or operated. Yes, they're East Asian, but not Japanese...not the same! I guess it's better than the sushi place uptown that was run and operated by Indians!?! Needless to say, it went out of business.   They didn't have sparkling water so we settled for club soda (they charged us for club soda, now that's a first). We ordered lemonade for my 4yo and asked for an extra cup to split the drink with our 19 month old. They wouldn't allow it - she can't drink a whole cup and we never intended for a refill. Fine, order another lemonade. Neither of my girls drank more than a quarter of their drinks. Then as we ordered, asked about sashimi pieces and the waitress repeated several times how there's a .50 surcharge for sashimi. OK, it's written there plain as day and we still want it. Then I asked the difference between a classic vs. hand roll, stating I want the kind with rice on the outside. Response: if you don't want rice, it's an extra dollar. Ummm I want rice but thanks for reminding how you nickel and dime your customers anyway you can. Also, if you're removing an ingredient and it's all made on request, why would you charge extra?? So strange.  Re: food, we started with miso soups that tasted like tap water and almost raw seaweed. I ordered fried rice for the kids, shrimp tempura, gyoza dumplings, spring rolls and cali roll. I've never seen a shrimp tempura look like that...it was also mainly batter and very little shrimp. Spring rolls were bland and Costco has better dumplings. My mother and husband eat sashimi and sushi often so they ordered the volcano roll, a few pieces of salmon and yellowtail. They were extremely disappointed by the lack of freshness with the sashimi. The volcano roll was DRENCHED in mayo and sauce - my husband felt like he drank a bottle of mayo. After our initial plates, we were still hungry but didn't want to subject ourselves to more terrible food. We regretted not going to musashi (Japanese family run) or Baku. I would GLADLY pay double or triple the amount to eat quality Japanese food and also not be reminded constantly about how much you are paying for the food. It was such a bizarre and kind of annoying experience. My husband apologized profusely for even suggesting it.   If you like sashimi, head over to clean catch fish market and request their sashimi grade faro island salmon or tuna. Pair it with some soy sauce, wasabi and ginger, and you'll have a delicious sashimi experience in Charlotte, in your home! If that's too much work, try musashi or Baku - much more expensive, but you get what you're paying for.",

After trying several places and being disappointed every time, Mr. Tokyo was a very pleasant surprise, especially for all you can eat. I was expecting the quality to be low, but that was not at all the case. Each roll was fresh, vibrant, and well constructed. The fish was incredibly fresh. I love yellowtail and the yellowtail sushi appetizer was the best I've had... ever. The service was very friendly and professional. My single complaint was that it was very, very slow. We waited for a table for 30 minutes, began eating at 7pm, and didn't finish until 9pm!! That was an exceptionally long time for people who can usually eat a meal in 15 minutes . Seriously though, super super slow but I thought it was fabulous quality sushi and friendly staff. Plus, $17.99 for all you can eat sushi included hibachi, some entrees, appetizers, soups, and sides. It was an incredible selection. I will be going back for sure.",

Basically for that price you can order anything on the menu, but you have to eat it all.  I got 4 specialty rolls and then a few pieces of nigiri and squid salad later on.  I think I got my moneys worth.  I would have easily paid $9.00 per specialty roll plus the other items.  I got out of there, for 2 people, $40 plus tip.  That was for a total of 6 specialty rolls, 6 pieces of nigiri, squid salad, 2 drinks, tax.  Anywhere else in town that $70 all day long.  The sushi was as good as anywhere else in town.  I was a bit turned off by the \"lettuce\" in the softshell crab roll, but whatever.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be coming back here, especially during lunch when its even cheaper.  This is a great alternative to Ru-Sans but the seating is somewhat limited.",

BUT what do you expect at a place that is all you can eat? This last time they added a gratuity to our party of 5 so watch out for that on your bill.  The sushi is solid, but basic very similar to what you find in the local grocery stores. The sashimi is NOT worth the .50 per piece up charge so my suggestion is stay away from that. Also when you are ordering on their sheets make sure you check the correct column S for sashimi and N nigiri.  The place is small and if you can go when they are not busy that would be my suggestion. It is worth the $18.99 especially if you are going for sushi.  Enjoy and go hungry!",

I was by myself, and I didn't want to sit at the bar so I was definitely prepared to wait the whole time. I came back into the restaurant 40 minutes later and I was actually surprised at how many people were in there! It must be a popular spot.  The waitress sat me down and let me choose from a menu of sushi and other items, which I gladly accepted. I got all of the spicy options and they were extremely delicious! The sushi was well prepared, and I like the fact that they gave me a huge plate with all the sushi instead of several smaller plates like Sushi King does. No problems with my food, it came relatively quickly, and I left feeling full and satisfied! I brought some spicy mayo sauce to dip the sushi in because I knew they didn't have any there ;-)  That trip ended my search for the best sushi restaurant in Charlotte, I felt like it couldn't get better than that. Each shallow breath of mine was rewarding because I knew, due to me eating too much, that the food was good and had attacked my brain with an overload of flavor and deliciousness. Thank you guys!!",

    "text": "3.5 Stars!  Mr Tokyo is a Japanese restaurant located in Charlotte, NC.  I was there for a business trip, and my boss / manager picked this place to eat for dinner after we got off the plane.  They are known for their AYCE (All You Can Eat) / unlimited Sushi & Hibachi ($18.99 per person for adults).  Be careful as they do charge for leftovers!!    I rated it 3.5 stars because it's not exactly authentic, but for the $18.99 AYCE price, it's really worth the value and the quality of the fish.  I came with my boss and another colleague - all of us agreed that their salmon was really fresh (at the time).  Good variety and selection for the price.    ENJOY!!",

If sushi isn't your thing, there are other options available. Why go anywhere else, when you can have AYCE sushi and hibachi for $18.99 (dinner price)! The only downside is not taking home the leftovers. Otherwise, you'd be insane to pass up this deal! Each roll is packed with high-quality ingredients. I've eaten here twice for dinner within the past two weeks--with no wait time during each visit. Not. sure what the lunch crowd is like.   I'm highly impressed with the size and quality of the Chef Special Rolls! You should definitely come hungry, and wear your stretch pants. My first visit, I walked out waddling!  I prefer the specialty rolls because I'm obsessed with the plating!!! Definitely, picture worthy!   Here are my personal favorites! I would highly recommend ordering these:  I've ordered the Mr. Tokyo & Snow White Roll twice already. So what does that tell you? Hahaha!   Dragon & White Dragon Roll  Lobster Salad Roll - This will open your sinus's for sure. I've never had a lobster salad but this was pretty amazing.   I'll be coming back for my third visit this week. I plan to enjoy hibachi this time.",

Jesus... this is my favorite sushi/hibachi spot in Charlotte. I could legit eat here every day of my life. UNLIMITED sushi AND hibachi. No buffet. All hot, fresh, and delicious.   I was first introduced to this place by someone I was dating who completely wasted my time, but in the words of Fantasia Barrino, \"sometimes you gotta lose to win again\" and every time I eat here, I feel like I'm winning and winning and winning. The food has been varying levels of exceptional each and every time. ONLY ONCE was my hibachi slightly less than warm, but out of the 20+ times I have eaten here in the second half of 2018 ALONE, that is the first and only time it has happened. Another time, there was one waiter who was absolutely terrible, but I haven't seen him since that day. If you go, ask for Paige or Nancy. Paige is super cool, funny, and a great waitress and Nancy makes sure you're taken care of. Keep it up ladies!  Favorite things to order: Nigiri - Masago, Surf Red Clam, and Shrimp Hibachi - Shrimp/Chicken + extra shrimp sauce Sushi - Anything not deep fried Dessert - Fried Ice Cream  I legit eat here once a week and I always leave with a little pep in my step, a little wiggle in my jiggle, and a dip in my hip! Easily my favorite restaurant of 2018.",

With their \"Unlimited\", All-You-Can-Eat Lunch Special, you can order anything on the menu (minus desserts and drinks?), and have as many plates/bowls as you want for just $12.99!  How can you beat that?? I have to say that their Miso Soup didn't taste quite right, but loved their fresh Crabmeat Salad...and their Maki Rolls (I ordered Dynamite and TNT) were the Bomb! I also had to try their Green Tea Mochi Ball for dessert (for a very small charge...less than $2?).  This small, lone Mochi Ice Cream Ball is topped with Whipped Cream...and was pretty good (nothing too special, but good).  Actually perfectly sized treat to come after an \"unlimited\" feast!  The place itself is quite small, but very cozy with a generous number of dark wooden chairs and booths.  As typical with most Asian restaurants, the service was quick and accommodating, though fairly stiff (due to possible language barrier?).  Overall, I found Mr. Tokyo VERY attractive (SO generous!)...and I definitely plan on revisiting \"him\" in the future.",

Where is the taste of the fish? The rice portion is huge.  Speaking of the rice, it is not very well cooked.

You can't get 2 rolls at a regular sushi joint; you can't get 2 small plates at a tapas restaurant; you can get 1 pizza but not an appetizer -- let's be real; $16.99 doesn't get you much, rarely the opportunity to gorge yourself to the brink of calling a state of digestive emergency.  Mr. Tokyo gets 4.5 stars -- rounding up to 5 for: (1) good service; (2) good food; and (3) superb value.    THE CAVEATS: 1)  If you want sashimi, there's a $.50/piece upcharge -- reasonable since you're getting twice the sushi with half the ability to fill up because you're not consuming any carbs or fillers 2)  No waste policy.  If you have 4+ pieces leftover (that's half a roll), then you will be charged for the roll but you can take it home with you  Location and ambience. It's located in a strip mall and the restaurant is relatively small, which explains the wait time.  The decor tries to be modern with backlighting but otherwise nothing remarkable and is your typical Japanese or sushi restaurant.    Good service. We came around 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon and were seated right away (the restaurant was 25% full).  Our server was extremely attentive and prompt, gave us the rundown on the restaurant rules, and seamlessly served or cleared away everything we needed and didn't need, respectively.   Good food.  All things considered, the food here is solid, especially given that you're meant to eat in bulk -- the Costco of sushi dining, so to speak.  You're not going to get Toro or any other premium grade sushi because that's not what you're paying for; if that's what you're seeking, be prepared to shell out 3 or 4 times more for your meal (if this is your expectation, then I'm calling you out for being one of those whiners who expects champagne on a beer budget).  There are quite a few AYCE sushi joints in S Cal with this exact premise; Mr. Tokyo is right on par with the 4.5-star S Cal counterparts.    TIP: you can ask for substitutions or modifications to your order so you get exactly what you want.  For example, I only wanted the sweet potato in the vegetable tempura and that's exactly what they brought me.  I've had: +++  miso soup.  The broth is a perfect blend of the miso stuff and tofu; I've been to places where it's super watered down before +++  squid salad.  The squid salad is superb (ask for lemon to squeeze over it for a little tangy kick; this is how it's usually served at other sushi restaurants) and usually is $9 just for the salad +++  yellowtail.  We've had yellowtail all over Charlotte: BLT Steakhouse, Baku, Cowfish, and Hibiscus and the yellowtail here is better than Cowfish and Hibiscus (you're limited to one order per customer) +++  shrimp tempura.  Crispy and the ponzu sauce is great (sweet with just a little tangy lemon kick); my BF liked it with the spicy mayo.  +++  sweet potato tempura.  A teeny bit on the greasy side but it's tempura, after all.  Clearly wasn't way too greasy because I asked for two orders. +++  ika (squid) sushi.  The freshness, consistency and sweetness of the squid is great; I had 4 orders (you order them 1 piece at a time).  I added masago to my second order. +++  philly roll.  I like the cream cheese and usually order this sans avocado.  Next time, I'll stick with the Panther roll because it tastes better and has the cream cheese in it +++ Panther roll.  Delicious.  It has shrimp tempura, cream cheese, crab, jalapeno and sriracha.  It was splendid.    Room for improvement.  They will only make you a full roll so you really have to commit to 7-10 pieces; I'd prefer to have the flexibility to try more items and order half rolls but I get it, it's more work for them.  Value.  First and foremost, for eating at an establishment that serves bulk raw fish, it passes the digestive test (after your meal, are you counting the minutes until you get home and taking an inventory of the number of people in your car vs the number of bathrooms you have?; would this be a safe first date venue? -- the epitome of diner's remorse).  Second, the overall dining experience was commensurate to the price; in fact, given there are few places where you can stuff your face and still get pretty good quality food, it feels like a steal (the table adjacent to us served two people 4 sushi rolls each; they were in it to win it!).  When it comes to consuming raw fish, especially considering that you know that you're not being served premium grade sushi, you have to be cognizant that you're taking a calculated digestive risk; there's a delicate balance between quality vs. quantity.  However, the risk here is small, the food is solid, and the value is tremendous.  Kudos to Mr. Tokyo for finding that equilibrium and delivering on a great dining experience that is worth every penny.",

    "text": "This is an \"all you can eat\" sushi/hibachi place. However, if you waste any food you'll get charged some $ for not finishing them. I think it's .50 per piece. We live about an hour away but this has become our go to spot for sushi. It is the BEST and freshest sushi that we've ever had and so we do make the drive whenever we're in the mood for sushi. We've had the clear soup, cream cheese Rangoon, spring rolls,  pork dumplings, and tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables off the appetizer menu before and we loved it! For sushi, you'll have to mark on the piece of paper what you want and they'll make it fresh for you. Keep in mind, it's not like going to the Chinese buffet and picking it off the bar. We haven't had anything here that we didn't like. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi and can eat a lot!!! Price for adult during lunch is 12.99 and for dinner it's 18.99. Yes, it may seem pricey but for the quality and quantity of the food here you will not be disappointed. It's always so busy that sometimes we have to get on the waitlist to be seated but it's worth it!",

We also had three different type of sushi rolls and my favorite was the Mr. Tokio one, which was full of flavor.   I want to go back to try other specialty sushis. What I don't think I've ever seen before is that they will charge you for every piece of roll you don't eat, so it's better to start with something small and after you finish you can order more. This is the only reason I give it four stars.  We'll come back again for sure.",

    "text": "If the Carolinas lack anything, it's good Asian food. There is literally zero good Chinese food. Mr. Tokyo almost makes up for it with their Japanese offering. This has become our favorite place to eat in the Charlotte area. The value is incredible - $14 for lunch and $19(?) for dinner.   The nigiri quality is what you'd expect. You definitely get what you pay for. I wish they had the white tuna (escolar) at lunch.   They change their roll offerings almost too much that I don't remember which ones I liked and if they were removed. I will say the rolls are really the best value here. Having moved from out of state, some of their rolls easily can go toe-to-toe with rolls we've seen go for $14 at regular price (which we got at half-price #ladies night).   What I love is they also have hibachi and [at dinner] noodle dishes - great for people who don't like sushi (they have a bunch of other non-sushi items).   Their cheese rangoons (now crab?)...I think they're imported from heaven and are delivered on a golden cloud of hope and joy.   The service is great. Never had a problem. The hosts will often pitch in to help deliver the food. And they are surprisingly very accommodating - I was near full and wanted fried rice and they said they'd do a small plate vs regular size for me. Awesome people.   So overall, heck yes. The quality is better than you'd expect and the rolls are better than we deserve.",

Don't like something or can't finish it? $1.00 per roll! Their massive rolls average 8 big pieces per roll, which makes it very hard to do any real sampling unless you're just absolutely pigging out or with a large group.  The good: The rolls are pretty creative and quite tasty. The sushi is the quality that you'd expect at this type of restaurant: not great but pretty good. It's nice that they have some appetizers and cooked items as part of the AYCE menu.  Overall not sure if I'll go back or not. A good coupon would probably be enough to sway me.",

Not sure if other locations have the same menu.   Photo from previous posts for all-you-can-eat dinner menu have the correct information when I went to visit.   Food quality was so-so/average compared to cheaper to mid-ranged pricing. What was disappointing was extra charge for sashimi, which I suppose is more common than not in this region.   More than that, the special rolls are full rolls which can pretty much fill you up with one or two rolls. the hibachi/teriyaki dishes are full sized dishes as well. If you're only going for dinner with a friend, it's not worth it.  their version of squid was a full sized plate as well, not very well seasoned, and rubbery. Shrimp tempura was also heavily battered and probably fried in old oil, again, texture also consistent with sushi restaurants this region.  Over all, I was more disappointed with portion sizes of their rolls and grill dishes on the AYCE menu as I wasn't able to try a lot of their food.",

You are also given the choice of not having vegetables or rice. If you choose shrimp tempura, without veggies and rice, you are given three fairly large shrimp. But if you order the hibachi shrimp you get a small serving of popcorn shrimp. She made the discovery trying to eat all of the entree without having to pay the uneaten charge.  The proteins by themselves are cooked well and are accompanied by a good tasting dipping sauce. I try to eat something that I haven't had before every time I eat there. This time I tried the mackerel nigiri. Wow! Talk about a fishy tasting fish! The taste and smell brought back memories of growing up in a New England seaport. It really livened up my palate as well. My wife's only comment was that only I and the dog enjoy mackerel.  The hostesses seemed glad to see me again. They kept asking me where I'd been and that I had to come by more often.",

They provide decent variety (not great but not bad), but they definitely give a good helping for each specialty roll, so you can't really try a lot of different ones in a single sitting. The best way is to share with a larger group to get a few bites of each.  The service is fine and there's always a little bit of a wait during peak dinner time. Don't expect fine dining here though.",

They provide table service and the sushi is freshly prepared to order! Lunch for an adult is $12.99 and dinner is $18.99. They don't serve the lunch menu on Saturday and Sunday. All of the food that I have had from them has been very good except the miso soup which tastes like chlorine. They seriously need to use filtered water or something. I'm still giving it five stars because everything else I've had from them has been great and the value is there as well. They offer standard sushi (nigiri, sashimi, maki) and specialty rolls. All of the specialty rolls that I have tried have been top notch! The hibachi is really tasty too so don't overlook that. One warning, don't over order as you may be charged if you are not able to eat it all. All in all this is a great place and a welcome addition to the Pineville area!",

They provide you with a pencil and paper of things to check you would like to try but be careful if you get too much you have to pay for what you don't eat on your plate but the good thing of it all is the money goes towards a good cause. One thing i also noticed is the drink menu , theirs pretty much not much of one they offer saki, and wines that's pretty much it far as an alcoholic beverage goes.

This visit made me feel as though I was at a cheap buffet and with the current price they have for all you can eat sushi I would rather eat at nice sushi restaurant because i don't even eat enough to make the all you can eat worth it. The price isnt horrible for all you can eat and the sushi is above average but not amazing. However I was unimpressed by the service and restaurant itself.  Firstly, my waitress didn't bring out the appetizers before the sushi rolls. And then she forgot two of my orders as well and I had to remind her what we ordered. No apology was given after her mistake either.   Secondly, beware of what they give you. If they think you don't know what you're ordering they will cheat you and stuff your rolls with crabmeat or skip out on the fish you ordered. I knew that two of my rolls had a combo of two different raw fish in them and when I brought it up to the waitress she just brushed it over and said oh must have been a mistake in the kitchen. (Again, no apology) This is also is unlikely because how do you forget the main ingredients for two rolls. So I'm guessing they were trying to save money or something. Either way totally unprofessional.  Thirdly, I'm a server myself so I understand getting hungry on a shift. However, sitting down at a table across from us and eating a full meal while on the job is unprofessional.  I believe this restaurant had the potential to be a huge hit but there are two main things that make me want to go back to a restaurant: excellent service and good quality. Both of which was lacking.",

    "text": "I went to this location with my daughter and it was quite a disappointment. We went to the restaurant and were seated at a table right away.  The waitress came over to take our initial order as this is an all you can eat buffet.  While I was placing my order I advised her that I was allergic to shellfish.  The waitress was quite confused and said that she would check with her manager.  When she returned she said that the restaurant could not accommodate me. She said \"the manager suggests you eat somewhere else.\"  I was highly offended and very disappointed as I left and they added insult to injury when they took my $5 for the two sodas that we ordered.    In 2019 for any food establishment NOT to be able to serve menu items to it's patrons safely is simply UNACCEPTABLE.  If you sell Salmon and I come in and say I want an order of Salmon there is simply no reason why my salmon should get cross contaminated with anything else.  There should be an area where someone who wants fish can still safely get their food prepared.  Thank you for the honesty Mr Tokyo but you really need to fix the situation and do better.  People should not just have to \"go somewhere else.\"  If you have any allergy (shellfish, gluten, peanut, etc.) DO NOT GO HERE. . . all food is prepared in the same small space and using the same knives, grills and mats so you may get sick or could die if the reaction is serious enough.",

It wasn't until after we began eating unfortunately when both my boyfriend and I were completely discussed at what we witnessed by a young lady (in a white blouse) standing at the computer system right next to the sushi bar (about 3 feet from the actually food and sushi was being made at the time!!!!)  She was FLOSSING HER TEETH!!! Popping her floss from her teeth right towards the food, now I'm in the dental industry and not only is you mouth full of bacteria but what you pull from teeth with floss has an absolutely horrible smell no matter who you are or how well you take care of your teeth! Not only was she flossing right next to the food but she NEVER washed her hands as she continued to work and touch things all around the restaurant!  Needless to say we got our check and got the hell out there, both unsatisfied with what we had just witnessed but also still hungry, we proceeded to come home and order pizza! So sad because ya'll have a great concept but we will NEVER be back, it has to be one of the grosses things I have ever seen take place in a restaurant and I worked F&B for over 10 years! SMH get it under control Mr. Tokyo!!",

There was a 50 minute wait and we ended up sitting at the sushi bar sooner than 50 minutes. We had: 2 octopus nigirl 3 eel nigirl Rainbow roll Snow white roll Deep blue roll Pepper tuna roll Spicy girl roll Sweet heat roll And last but not least hibachi beef I can't believe we ate the whole thing !!! But we did.....and at $19/person this was a crazy great value. Our favorite was the eel nigiri and the pepper tuna roll. Least favorite was the octopus nigiri. It wasn't bad, just not our favorite. Once we sat down and ordered our sushi it arrived very quickly. Honestly I liked everything about this experience. Can't wait to go back. The value was amazing. I have paid a lot more for lesser quality tasting sushi. Five stars from me.",

This place probably has one of the most efficient and attentive service I've experience so far around the area.  Someone is always coming back to check and take orders since this is an ALL YOU CAN EAT JAPANESE RESTAURANT and the best thing about it is that it's COOK TO ORDER. It's $16.99 per person during dinner time but it's so worth the price cause I'm use to paying around $30-40 per person for decent sushi at regular Japanese restaurants.  Mr. Tokyo offers sushi, sashimi, sushi rolls, hibachi entrees, soup and salads, and sushi appetizers. You name it, they probably have it.   We love love LOVE the Mr. Tokyo Roll, it's so good we had to keep ordering it. Oh, and the yellowtail jalapeno is a must try also.",

Never go around noon, unless you enjoy waiting 30+ minutes.  FOOD There's not much to say here. There is an abundance of sushi choices on the menu, and I would rate the quality being just a hair over what you might get at a grocery store. I enjoyed it. Pro tip: they have ice cream that is included in your all-you-can-eat price. Don't forget it!  SERVICE Service is decent. The issue is that Mr. Tokyo never has more than two or three guys making sushi, which of course slows everything down. Just make sure to order two or three rolls at once and you should be good.  PRICES $12 for lunch, $18 for dinner. I would say those are fair. If you eat three rolls, the all-you-can-eat prices have paid for themselves.  If you're coming here for world class sushi, you'll be disappointing, but if you just want some decent sushi for fair prices, this is your place. I love it.",

    "text": "This place was phenomenal when it opened but I went there with my fiance last month and overall the place has slipped a bit.  The quality of the sushi has dipped since opening month, which is understandable I suppose. I will say that their eel is not very good at all; even opening month I tried their eel roll and it was probably the worst I've had in Charlotte.  Their specialty rolls are pretty good, anything fried is a good choice, and their crazy roll was great. Not nearly as good as opening month but it's all-you-can-eat sushi so I suppose there's a tradeoff in quality.  I'll say it again the crazy roll is fantastic.  The real deal breaker for me is not the food quality.   Last time I visited was probably the first time in quite a while and they did something I'd never noticed before. Probably around round 3 of sushi the rolls started getting bigger and stuffed with noticeably more rice and fillers (celery etc) than they had in previous rounds. This continued until we stopped ordering. This is a deal breaker for me and trumps anything else since the premise of the restaurant is all-you-can-eat and since they charge you if you don't finish your plate which is clearly marked on the menu. I won't be returning to Mr. Tokyo for this reason, and the decline in quality since the restaurant opened.",

Sushi excellent - as good as Sushi 101 with some cool choices. Everything we ate was just darn good. Would have loved to have a drink but they don't sell alcohol - which is fine and likely reason cost is so low. PRICE - Excellent. For the food and everything, it is incredible. Really. SERVICE - Good. People very friendly and nice. Tried to be helpful but servers forgot some of our order 2x and actually never came back with one of them after being told. Nothing rude - just not great service. Wait for food was, at times, pretty darn long...especially when you have 2 kids under 7 years old. AMBIANCE - Pretty good. Very nice interior, clean, open, not too loud. Seating was bit crowded but nothing bad. Bathroom was pretty nice but it was a bit \"dirty\" (overfilled trash baskets and stuff on floor). No biggie with a big rush but not great.  Can't wait to go back. Really enjoyed it. Thanks!",

We finished our sushi, and wanted to order a fried ice cream for dessert, and a glass of white wine. As the time went by, we asked another waitress for another menu to order from. No one ever brought another menu over. Eventually, 30 minutes after finishing our food, we just asked another waitress to get our check for us, as our waitress was in the corner talking and laughing with her friends. We paid, and left without having received everything we wanted to get. I give four stars because the food was amazing, just don't expect good service.",

Being from LA, it was probably the best decision since we didn't feel welcomed to the establishment and the since the service lacked class, assumed the food would follow suit. :(",

The Sushi is fresh and well prepared.  It is not at all like buffet Sushi.  One of my favorites is the Salmon and Lemon...very refreshing.  I don't care for crispy, crunchy or saucy Sushi. They do have choices for those who don't want Sashimi or Nigiri style.  My kids are always looking for a special occasion to go here.  Almost forgot to mention they've got several types of Saki available as well.",

    "text": "The fish tasted very fresh.  A little more than the ideal amount of sushi rice with the nigiri.  At just $10.99 for AYCE lunch, it's amazing value.  (Consider that at most sushi restaurants, that wouldn't even buy you two rolls.)  Age tofu is 3 pieces per order; gyoza is 6 pieces per order.  There's also soups and salads.  Nigiri is 1 piece per order; rolls are 8 pieces per order.  I was pleased to see the selection of specialty rolls, which to me are more interesting than nigiri.  There's a wide variety even off the lunch menu, with some rolls featuring shrimp tempura or avocado or cream cheese or multiple kinds of tobiko (roe).  They are artfully crafted by the sushi chefs at the bar.  Friendly service, but order turnaround is slow when it's busy.  Makes sense since there's only three sushi chefs.  As a result, it's a little time-consuming to do multiple rounds, unless you order the next round before you empty the current plate.  If they can keep the AYCE price this low, I would definitely come back.  Food:  4 stars Value:  5 stars Service:  3.5 stars Overall:  4.5 stars",

    "text": "Came here for dinner. It's a small place, and with people ordering non-stop, it's no wonder our wait time was 1 hour for TWO people. For the price of $19.99 (basically $20, let's be honest), you can order as many menu items as you desire, with the exception of sashimi (extra $0.50 per piece) and desserts (extra charge). Also, any leftovers will be an additional charge as well, so make sure that you only order what you can finish. There is no limit as to how many orders you can request at one time. However, it took a good while for our sushi to arrive, so order a bunch of appetizers to satisfy your hunger in the meantime.  Miso Soup - Tasty but would have loved some tofu in it. Avocado Salad - Literally a bowl of avocado slices on top of lettuce. Aged Tofu - 3 pieces - Crispy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside. Crab Rangoon - 2 pieces - These are folded envelope style. The skin is nice and crispy, and there is a good amount of filling. Wish the sweet and spicy dipped sauce was provided in a bigger container for better dipping though. Edamame - Salted on the outside, nothing to complain about. Gyoza - 3 pieces - The skin is done well. Spring Roll - 2 pieces - Perfectly crispy skin, but not so impressive filling Mostly cabbage in the filling. Shumai - 2 pieces - The pieces are incredibly small, bite-sized. They remind me of the frozen shumai, nothing special. Shrimp Tempura - 3 pieces - Perfectly flaky, but again, I wish the dipping sauce was contained in a bigger dish, especially considering how long the shrimp are. Salmon Lover - salmon, cucumber, avocado with slices of salmon on top, 8 pieces Snow White Roll - sweet crabmeat, avocado with salmon, tuna, escolar, and crunchy shavings on top, 8 pieces Deep Blue Roll - tempura crabmeat, mango, avocado with lobster chunks on top, 8 pieces  I enjoyed the Snow White Roll the most, and then the Deep Blue Roll, and then the Salmon Lover. The fish is fresh and delicious. The sushi come out all at one time, beautifully displayed on a platter. I hate that the sashimi is charged extra per piece. However, there are plenty of other items on the menu to select.",

    "text": "Rude Manager/Overpriced/Forced gratuity for family of 5 We ate at the Pineville store after some recommendations from others. We had a party of 5 (family). 3 chose the all you could eat and 2 ate off the ala carte menu. The ala carte menu was $6 cheaper but had 3 times more food than the all you can eat portion for the same items. We waited over 45 min to get our food the first time and reordered immediately when we saw the portion on the all you can eat. We waited another 45 min to receive the second plate, after everyone else was finished eating. Even with the first and second plates combined, there was still less food on the all you could eat compared to the amount of food given on the ala carte plate. We had a family of 5. We were charged an 18% gratuity. We had not complained or even asked why our food was taking so long. We were there not quite 2 hours. Luckily we didn't have little ones.  I asked the manager to take it off the automatic gratuity so I could tip the server in cash (and more than 18% and the manager was rude and refused). Since the law now gives automatic gratuity to the store, it is very possible the server will not receive any of the gratuity I was forced to pay. There were only 5 of us...not a group of random people but a family and I was paying the entire bill (not split in anyway). This incident will keep us from ever going back. My 22 year old felt her chicken was slimy and didn't like the taste of her hibachi chicken. There was not an option for plain rice...you had to have fried rice. Miso soup came with the meal but clear soup was an extra charge. The all you can eat was definitely not worth the money when you have to wait that long for a simple teriyaki chicken and plain fried rice dish. It took so long, we didn't want to wait for another order, and I would question if this was intentional. Mind you, the restaurant was not packed (not empty either) and there were plenty of open tables. We had to sit one person at the end of a booth in a chair in a main walkway - but there were plenty of other open tables. There were plenty of servers. Ours was sweet but she couldn't bring food that wasn't ready. It appeared she had 2 tables (including ours). This is why I was planning on tipping her more than 18%. I prefer to tip In cash so servers can take home the cash the same day they make it. But the manager refused to take it off, even with me showing her the cash and telling her I was planning on tipping her well.  One of our all you could eat diners, ordered 2 sushi rolls (only) and was charged $2 more for each one because they were on the list for all you could eat. Deserts were also an additional cost from the all you could eat. Ala carte was definitely the better way to go. However, less than a mile away is a major Japanese restaurant that you can eat to the side and the cost is much less or even costs less to watch the \"the show\" with much better quality food. Regardless, I will not return ever to this restaurant. Managers should do what they can to help their servers. I question how many times parties of 4 or more are being charged a service fee and the tip Is not making it to the actual server. Show less Date of visit: July 2019",

I understand if we'd walked in at 10PM or after - but close to an hour before closing??!!  REALLY.    Needless to say we will not be back here or any Mr. Tokyo from now on.  You lost a customer.

I wasn't expecting full size sushi with the all you can eat but to my surprise they were ! I was blown away with the hibachi . My meat was seasoned so well which exceeded my expectations. Most hibachi places the meat is usually bland. I'm never going anywhere else for hibachi. The lunch deal is pretty solid at 12.99 for all you can eat . I ordered spring rolls, a salad, a roll and chicken and shrimp hibachi. That could have easily been $20 somewhere else. It's definitely worth it but be careful, you will get charged for what you don't eat . My friend was charged about $2 for each sushi piece she didn't consume.",

    "text": "Wow. All you can eat sushi/Japanese buffet anytime of day, just different prices at different times, as well as, minor changes to the menu. It's a very popular restaurant so be prepared for some kind of wait time. Some times you might even get into shared table seating which isn't so bad, it'll be a social event - depending on your mood (lol). Once you're seated each person gets a paper menu and you can put the quantity of each dish that you want. It is all you can eat, so you can get as many papers as you want. To make it easier, we put both of our orders onto one paper so that our rolls come out on one dish instead of two plates. Be careful some items are one order per person because of limited amount (like the yellowtail jalapeno or the Mr. Tokyo bowl). Other items might be a slight extra charge (sashimi was 0.50 cents per piece).   Overall ALL the sushi rolls were great and fresh. My favorites were the Tiger Roll and the Charlotte Roll. My favorite appetizer is the clear soup. There's also edamame, mid soup, crab Rangoon, seaweed salad, classic rolls. I was surprised that they had a spicy California roll, by the time I saw that I was already full and couldn't dare try it. We also had the hibachi with shrimp and veggies only. You can have it with steak, chicken, or rice, or all of the above - you can circle what you'd like.",

The location is not fancy or large but it gets the job done.   So basically, its an all you can eat that's brought to your table for a flat fee of $18.99/adult dinner prices.    I really like that they charge you for pieces left over, as a result it causes one to be cognizant of what you order, not ordering too much/only ordering what you will eat.  Our last visit was at 7pm on a Sunday night.  They were busy and we had to wait for about 25 minutes, buuuut it was SOOOO worth it! If you're not seated in one of the booths, you may have to share a table with the other patrons.  I welcome this as its a good chance to see other types of sushi that I may not be aware of.   They also offer appetizers, such as 2 triangle shaped crab rangoons (soo delish!), veggie tempura, awesome shrimp tempura.  Be sure to try the Mr. Tokyo Bowl (limit one per person!)   They also offer hibachi, fried rice etc.   There are some items that aren't included under the $18.99, such as ice cream and desserts such as fried cheesecake. The fried cheesecake is super rich and perhaps a little weird bec of the texture.  Regardless, great place to catch up with friends and family with a bonus of good sushi. This place has quickly become one of our favorite places for dinner!",

On the lunch menu you miss out on the Salmon Lover Roll, Mr Tokyo Bowl and many more types of Nigiri including my personal favorite Eel Nigiri. Don't get me wrong, for 12.99 the options are still amazing and the quality of the sushi is also good but for $20 you get a more whole experience. We ordered the salmon nigiri, dragon roll, and another roll with crab and mango in it (forgot the name), along with the KFC roll. All the rolls are fantastic as usual but the KFC roll is something different. Very unique chicken sushi with a hint of spice. I would try it if you still for room in your stomach and like fried chicken. It has a very unique taste. I think next time I would still come for lunch (even with a smaller menu) if I'm craving sushi... but if you want to FEAST, I would I invest $7 more dollars for the $20 dinner/weekend menu.",

    "text": "Maybe I caught them on a bad day.  Rolled up and saw about 10 - 15 people waiting outside and I got excited.  I figured this many people waiting, it must be good.  It was OK.  Just OK.    I saddled up to the bar and didn't have to wait which was good.  Those guys rolling sushi were straight up hustling.  There was like 4 of them and they didn't stop.  Service was lacking.  The servers that I dealt with didn't talk much and didn't speak or seem to understand much English.  With this type of place with the all you can eat, and the rules on the menu it'd be nice if the servers could answer questions.  This all could be forgiven for amazing sushi.  It was good, nothing to write home about and frankly the bar is set low in the Queen City for amazing sushi imo.  Rolls were good, but uninspiring.  The fish was fresh and tasty which was a good thing.  The value for what you get is good also.  For $12.95 I got an order of gyoza, and 2 rolls.  I could have squeaked out another roll and really gotten my money's worth but didn't want to be miserable the rest of the day.  All this to say.  I doubt I'll be back.....if you're looking for quantity and above the normal quality in this area.....Mr Tokyo fits the bill",

Starting with the service, the waitstaff all were disinterested in being at work and were all congregated to the right of the sushi bar up front, talking, looking at their cell phones, not paying attention to diners.  The server we had didn't welcome us, just stood by the table and didn't offer assistance or converse while we were looking at the menu.  The \"sushi\" was the worst quality of \"fish\" that I ever had.  DO NOT ORDER SASHIMI TUNA.  It was so poor and I'm not sure it was even legit.  The hibachi steak was the worst cut pieces of meat I've had, tough, grisly and looked unappetizing.  Disgusting really.  Don't waste your $$ buying the all you can eat concept.  It's a joke and marketing ploy.  WAY OVERPRICED FOR THE LACK OF SERVICE AND QUALITY OF FOOD.  Spend your money elsewhere.  Anywhere but here. I'm warning you!",

As someone who has lived with high metabolism, I can feel in the restaurant if something is not fresh and there is definitely a sanitation issue.  1. The whole time there was water dripping from the ceiling right next to my table. 2. The food literally made me feel sick to my stomach.  3. I don't mind paying for the excess but it was literally making me feel sick, and inexcusable. Usually I have no problem eating that amount of sushi but between diarrhea and paying extra, I prefer my well-being. The manager was also pretty rude when addressing this issue I had. She insisted that her \"health insurance\" can pay if I get a health complication. And no matter my experience she has to follow \"policy\". Not a way a good manager would've handled things.  I don't think I will be returning.",

    "text": "Well, somehow I have not written a review yet, which is odd because this is my favorite restaurant. I frequent both locations and have spent 2 birthdays here. I live in the middle of both locations, so it's really a matter of which one am I closer to at the time or what time/day of the week it is.  I have never ordered anything off of the regular menu as I always get the all you can eat special for $18.99. But, let me say this, it is well worth it! You pay the one price and you get unlimited food. You have an order sheet and you fill out what you want, then they go back and make it fresh. I am at the point where I get the same thing each time.   On my first order, I always get an order of Shrimp Tempura, Crab Rangoon, Angel Hair Roll (Tempura Shrimp, Cucumber, Crab meat and mas ago on top), and a Spiderman Roll (Tempura Soft Shell Crab, Tempura Shrimp, Avocado, and Lettuce). My favorite being the Angel Hair Roll. It has a little kick to it, but I love it!  On my second order, I normally switch over to Steak HIbachi. Then, if I have any space left, I order more sushi or just get another order of Crab Rangoon. Honestly, I don't think anyone that loves Japanese food will have a problem finding something to eat here. I remember when I didn't like sushi that much and now I can't get enough of it.   Just go, you won't be disappointed at all!",

A little background of my food experience to begin with, I am from California and had plenty of authentic japanese food in Japan. That being said, there is a huge difference between American and japanese sushi but this restaurant neither tasted like japanese or American sushi; it just tasted cheap.   I ordered an edamame to start with, but took close to 15 mins. for it to come out. I understand if it was due to the business but then I discover a strand of pubic hair on top of the beans. Disgusted, I ask the waitress to get me a new one. Took another 15 mins and by that time we were already in the middle of our meal.  Handrolls were okay, probably the best things I could eat on the menu at the time. All the raw fish tasted very artificial, lacking the distinct flavor of each fish and tasted as if I was biting into a bland piece of fish.  Probably will not come here again and hope this review is helpful for first timers.",

With chopsticks she put it back on the plate and off to the guest... the american girl at the register saw all this and though she was clearly disgusted, she didn't do a thing to stop the waiter and change the order. Then the cheffs throw the ticket into the plate and it gets soaked, ink and paper touching the food. The waiters have to take it away with their fingers...not good.

    "text": "God forbid you ask to move from a table to a booth. Came in on a Saturday early afternoon to an empty restaurant. Was placed at a table and ordered our appetizers. We were placed next to some loud noisy diners and asked to be moved to one of the 4 empty booths for a quiet place to eat. Was told by the waiter flat out no.   Asked to speak to the manager who was just as rude. He said no, tough luck, we won't know where to deliver the food. I told him there were 15 people in the entire restaurant. It won't be hard to know our faces. He said but if someone sees you move then they all will want to move. I told him that was unlikely. I told him we won't be back and he said I don't care, that's no problem. Asking to move to be more comfortable when you're already spending an outrageous price on food shouldn't be made in to a big deal and a spectacle. The entire restaurant stopped and stared while he rudely rebuffed my request.  .  I guess they don't believe the customer is right here. I will spend my money where I'm treated right and not with such disrespect. I guess when a place is popular, the guest is unappreciated.  They've lost a customer for good.",

    "text": "Second visit since their grand opening. I went last night 9/19/17 with my well behaved 6 month old and his father, John, who is severely allergic to avocados and that's where things slid down the awkward slope.   I'm a friendly somewhat sushi snob so coming for all you can eat sushi is both exciting but a little unsure, because I've been told by sushi chefs else where that it's not the \"freshest\" quality. But a star because I feel fine, I'm not dead, not even a tummy ache so I believe they must have done good. I did semi-wolf down the food because I wanted to be mindful of getting out on time. We arrived around the 8:30 window (give or take), ordered by 8:42 ish and they close by 9:30.   So back to the death trap ingredient. We tell our young male server of this, and he kindly took extra care and notice of it and informs the chefs, then returns to say they'd like us to check off our card all at once so it's a one shot thing. We get that they don't want to have to clean their knives every time baby daddy orders something. It's a little time consuming and we're aware avocado is apart of half the sushi menu or it's well requested. But we were scared to over do it & wanted to abide by their \"no waste\" policy, but thankfully one take was good enough & that wasn't the problem. We're good with 8 pieces of nigiri, 4 spring rolls, 1 green salad, 1 chk+shr hibachi entree, 4 sushi rolls.  Then it seemed like that set the tone for the rest of the bad bad night aka 45 min.  Our food comes out oddly slow. His salad comes out first, cool, then he notices the sushi chefs are gone at the same time and no one is making anything for awhile, maybe they're all eating and we're just waiting... Then Nigiri comes out, couldn't find our guy so kindly asked young girl server close by for spicy mayo. I can do without so I'm happily eating and then 5 minutes later the girl is sitting at the employee's table, for their worker's group dinner together of  4+ along with who looks like a manager and is 2 tables away from us, close enough to see us trying to get someone's attention because, well, no sauce. John is confused and wants to eat but prefers the mayo and I'm awkwardly chomping in front of him.Then our only roll we replaced the avoc for cuke comes (White something roll) and we kindly ask our guy for spicy mayo only to find him 2 minutes later to be at the bar showing a guest something on his phone & talking and doesn't come back ever with the sauce. Now John after waiting and tolerating doesn't care to stay or pay any longer but I try to convince him it might get better. He's in this industry so he notices a lot but is very reasonable. The spring rolls comes by a third person, different young girl & John apologizes to her for having to ask for this golden sauce that her other 2 overly glorified co workers couldn't manage. I believe they must have thought we expected them to go dig a golden nugget and melt it down for us to dip but we're the thankful the 3rd girl gets it. Our original server decides to appear for a tea refill and John lets him know don't worry someone else got the sauce but server disregards and again asks for the tea only to come back and thud it back on the table and walk away, coward petty move young boy. John was only putting off eating while patiently waiting for what he asked for three times. That's what I get for making us stay when we should've walked out because obviously that was the last attitude we needed. But now we're in the \"we've been here this long, we're stuck now but would love to not be\" part of the night. The hibachi comes back partially burnt but it finally came so not bothering them to do it again and wait forever after the mood that already set in. The rest of the sushi finally makes it which were Charlotte Roll, Crazy Roll and Dynamite. Not in favor of the fried batter of the Crazy and Dynamite, not bad but if that's your type of roll then go for it, it was more to get down then we expected and left some. Server comes quickly to ask if we're good and inform that 9:15 is last call for orders, which was fine because we're stuffed. He comes by quickly again but doesn't stay for an answer,  just zooms. I'm very fed up at this point and hate to waste time and get no where because the whole place seemed very disorganized and careless and I just wanted to get out of there.   Summarized Cons: The strange order of food after the salad. We would think the hot food is easier to come out first but didn't. It was jumbled up in the mix of our sushi that took even longer to come out. The constant ignoring and forgetting of your guests. I have been in customer service for 14 years, and there's no way I would be so careless of my customers or unapologetic. Atmosphere wasn't professional. It doesn't take a lot to make right but they didn't care.",

I've been there twice now, once for dinner and once for lunch, and have yet to be disappointed. The sushi is just way above what you would expect for the AYCE price. My boyfriend had the hibachi and though its not quite up to authentic hibachi quality, it's still exceptionally good for being an AYCE item. They do charge for wasted food, but that's what helps keep the costs so affordable for customers. My advice is to order in small increments so you don't accidentally overload yourself! Just an FYI, lunch time on the weekends is VERY busy, so be prepared to wait!",

The dinner menu includes more than the lunch menu, but I thought the price was reasonable compared to other all-you-can-eat sushi places for both lunch and dinner.  For the price of some grocery store sushi rolls, you can order anything you want, including soup, salad, or hibachi.  The only catch is you have to eat whatever you order, or you may have to pay a little extra.",

I started with the Phoenix Maki Roll and our daughter had the noodles and beef.  It was all sooo good.  We each ordered a second round of food as well. It was good quality sushi and my husband was happy with the taste of his as well.  He said he would like to go back (always a good sign).  You definitely need to go hungry!!!!!",

As we enter the place we were welcomed by a magnificent setting and very friendly atmosphere. There was a wide range of exotic selections of rolls. I had their house special \"Mr Tokyo Rolls\". I'm usually a very picky sushi person but this place did not fail me. Their sushi was perfectly rolled and best of all, the fish meat was extremely fresh! For the most part,  I think everything was on point  with the exception of serving their food a little too slow or maybe I was a tap impatient since I was too hungry.   Overall, good and fresh food. Reasonable price and very hospitality atmosphere. I will be back for more the next time I visit Charlotte again. Definitely recommend and encourage friends and family in their area to try this place.",

Think all you can eat, but delivered fresh, made to order right to your table and with friendly faces all along the way!  I believe Mr. Tokyo has only been opened for a few months, but I finally had the chance to stop by last night. I posted pictures of the menu, but dinner is $16.99 per person and again, all you can eat! The entire menu is included in the AYCE, but if you want sashimi instead of nigiri, there is a $.50 upcharge per piece. We ordered 33 pieces of nigiri between the two of us (2 red snapper, 4 escolar tuna, 10 salmon, 8 yellowtail, 5 tuna, 2 mackerel and 2 tofu skins), jalapeno yellowtail, Mr. Tokyo bowl (salmon with spicy crab meat and tobiko), edamame, agedashi tofu, gyoza, crab salad, seaweed salad, squid salad, miso soup, crab rangoon, chicken and shrimp teriyaki, red bean and green tea ice cream. To say the least, we got our money's worth.   I was most impressed with the quality and size of the nigiri! I highly recommend the salmon and escolar tuna. We would have paid at least $50 for the nigiri alone anywhere else. What a great deal! Of the apps that we tried, the agedashi tofu and Mr. Tokyo bowl were my favorite. I don't recommend the gyoza or the crab rangoon, but there were enough deliciousness in between to keep me satisfied. I posted pictures of the menu in case you're curious. Definitively give this place a try!   Can I come back now?!",

    "text": "My family decided to eat here last night (a Friday night, mind you) and the wait was SUPER long... an hour and a half! It was definitely too long for my fiance and I to wait, but since we were joining my family we were stuck. I do not know if they take reservations or not, I never really got the chance to ask. There is one bench inside the building (at the entrance) to sit at, but outside there are no chairs or benches at all. There is a brick lining of the building that sticks out that you can sit on, but who really wants to sit on brick for an hour? After waiting about half the time, my fiance and I decided to get a beverage. They serve wine, sake, and beer (no liquor). We never had sake so we decided to get a fruity one! I cannot remember the exact name but it was definitely white peach - and delicious!  After waiting what seemed like FOREVER, we were told our table was ready. We walked inside and the table was not ready yet... We actually saw them still cleaning the table off and rearranging the chairs. I already waited an hour and a half and now I cannot even sit when my table was \"ready\". Maybe I'm being crazy, or hangry, or maybe even both...  Once seated, we were given a piece of paper where you select which food items you would like from the AYCE. Their rule is to order as much as you can eat, because they charge for the food that you do not finish - so order a few things, and if you are still hungry you can order again. I got the miso soup, spring rolls, and a Charlotte sushi roll with a glass of water. While everyone else already received their drinks, we were still waiting for our waters... It was busy, and the dining room was packed, so it wasn't a huge deal - until we heard our server talking to another server behind us saying \"why didn't you finish the drinks?\" \"I thought you were going to finish them\"... miscommunication.   The soups and salad came rather quickly. The miso soup was pretty refreshing. It took quite a while for the appetizers (shrimp tempura and spring rolls). You get two mini spring rolls with a sweet sauce to dip in. I do not like super crispy spring rolls, so these were perfect! They were lightly fried, but still had a little crunch to them. The sushi took a while to come as well, but with the whole table basically ordering 1-2 rolls each, that makes a lot! Once the rolls came it was amazing. The Charlotte roll was very delicious, and tasted fresh. I tried one of my fiance's roll (I forget the name, but it had avocados with jalapenos on top) and it was yummy too. I thought it would be too hot for me, but the avocados kind of mask the hotness and actually make it a bit more creamy.   Overall, the price of the AYCE is good if you plan to eat a light meal for lunch! You definitely want to go here when you are starving. I suggest maybe not going on a Friday night, way too long of a wait. The service was eh, but again they were busy so I really do not know if that was accurate. The food was delicious. I will be back, but for lunch during the week. The price is a little cheaper (since it is lunch) and I do not think there were be nearly as many people waiting.",

Maybe because it's down in Pineville and not 'The City', but I'll take it!   Pretty simple here. It's an AYCE (all you can eat) establishment with a twist. Instead of your standard buffet style AYCE, everything is actually made to order, just as a regular sushi restaurant would. As of this review, it's up to $18.99/pp for dinner ($12.99 for lunch).   Appetizers: Mr. Tokyo Bowl (a must try), spring roll, & gyoza (dumplings). I'd skip the tempura and save room for the good good.   Sushi rolls: my favorites are: Sweet Heat, Carolina, Snow White & Charlotte rolls.   Pro Tip: While the hibachi is good (v. good, even) I'd recommend skipping this unless you're splitting with several people. Don't make the rookie mistake and fill up on the basic stuff.",

    "text": "This is a very interesting concept-All you can eat appetizers, salads, hibachi, fried rice, udon noodles and sushi! It's not a buffet! It's made to order! For lunch it's $10.99 and for dinner its 16.99 which is really not bad. We came before 5/1 and got 15% off our check.   We came at a later lunch on a friday and there was a small wait. The staff all helps each other out so you have more than 1 server. The restaurant is very updated and modern. Very stylish and sleek.  We started off with the shrimp tempura, gyozas and seaweed salad. They were all good! I like that it's smaller portions so there is no waste and gives you more of a chance to try other things. We ordered 1 shrimp tempura appetizer and they brought us out two by accident.   We also got a few rolls and sashimi. All the rolls were very good and large. Very fresh too. Only complaint is that a few things were missing in our roll. We ordered the panther roll and it was supposed to have fresh jalapenos on it and there wasn't any. We also ordered another roll and they forgot to bring it. It did come out a little while later.The rolls took a while but we didn't mind since we were eating our appetizers. We got a total of 6 rolls and 3 pieces of sashimi. For everything we got it was definitely worth it. If we would of ordered the stuff we got at another sushi place we would of spent well over $70.   The service was fine. They were all very nice and friendly. I saw someone make a comment about how they didn't understand English well but that's so not True. They all spoke great English and understood everything we asked for. Since it's a new restaurant they are going to make mistakes. The mistakes they made for us were very minor and we are already planning on coming back.",

Normally we are going there when it is not too busy 3/4 pm on the weekends and we always get a table without wait time.The waitress are very friendly. When we went there the first time we got a a card with sushi pictures this was really helpful to decide what you want. What we like is , that you have to pay for the sushi when you can't eat it. So it is not a waste of food and you only eat what you really can eat.",

Considering the specialty rolls are $12ish, 2 rolls and you've already gone over $19. We both decided to go with AYCE since we couldn't share unless we did. You get to order from the entire menu and the only catch is if you leave anything behind you are charged for it. We each ordered an app - miso soup and spring rolls then ordered 5 rolls and I tried the udon noodles with chicken. It was so much food! Definitely come hungry. Everything was very fresh and I would come back again. This may not be high end fancy sushi but it's good. It's not quite 4 star but it's much better than 3.",

They have unlimited sushi and hibachi options which is something that you don't see too often(besides on those disgusting buffets) so to have a Mr. Tokyo offer that is awesome. This is a really good place to try some sushi rolls that you may not have tried otherwise and the price is reasonable. The restaurant is on the smaller side and was clean when I visited. The staff was fine as well. The quality of the dishes are good. I'll be going back to try more dishes!",

Of course there's an actual sushi bar, though on the smaller size, and comfy booths and plenty of large tables.   After you're seated, you're given (the old school) check list menu, which I happen to like- and it's got a nice amount of variety.   My favorite is the hand rolled sushi that reminds me of a mini-bouquet of surreal flowers. The avocado is my usual choice.   There's more than just sushi, here. You can have hibachi or teriyaki beef, chicken, or shrimp with rice and vegetables.   No wrong choices, though, especially at around 20 bucks a head for all you care to eat, but don't waste it, they'll possibly charge you, according to the menu.",

You can order as much as you want, they only ask for you to be able to finish what you order. They will charge for extra. No problem for me, soup and a couple of rolls will work just fine.   The wait staff was very nice and attentive.  Overall, great experience for a sushi joint. I was a little bummed that sashimi isn't on the lunch menu, this is probably because there isn't any rice to fill you up.   Do it for lunch, and yes, show early because they get busy at 12:00.",

(During weekdays lunch it may be the cheapest and best @ $13)  The fish is fresh, the selection is diverse and generous, and everyone here just looks so satisfied! Being from DC where we don't have anything like this and having visited tampa which has Koizi (which is similar but not as good), I can tell you all that you are very lucky to have this Mr Tokyo.  Comparing it to Rusan's and Pisces, it seems much better even on the weekends where you have to pay a few more $. Rusan's only offers rolls and a very limited selection of nigiri (sushi) and Pisces was subpar overall.   There's usually a wait for this place but I highly highly recommend it. Service can be a bit hectic.   Taste: 5/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5 (A bit hectic and crazy but it's not hard to catch a waiter/waitress) Value: 5/5",

We got the Spiderman Roll, Charlotte Roll, and another one with spicy salmon and mango in it - the last 2 tasted mostly the same to me, maybe because they were doused in similar sauces. Spiderman roll was definitely not as good as spider rolls we've had at other sushi places... the lettuce inside may be to blame. The cheese rangoon was awful, tasted like icing inside. My favorite thing we ordered was actually the stir fried udon! The nigiri was good too, nice vinegary rice and fresh-textured fish.   We definitely ordered more than $20 worth of food for our buffet price, so gotta be happy about that. But I think the actual food is just alright.",

For all you can eat place the quality sushi is essentially similar to any specialized sushi place in Charlotte.  12.99 for lunch and 18.99 for dinner and weekends, you cannot beat this place.  Also all sushi and normal menu food is all you can eat and made to order instead of pre made under a heat lamp or on ice. Always fresh and hot off the wok/fryer!!   Let's just hope this place eventually does not jack up the price even higher and go down on quality and menus choices just like what most successful Asian restaurants in Charlotte likes to do...

    "text": "Mr. Tokyo has a decent selection of items for the all-you-can-eat, and most of their fish is very fresh and delicious.  I like that you can do AYCE at lunch or dinner and the price is particularly reasonable for dinner time.  One of the few downsides is that their specialty rolls have something fried and covered in a lot of sauce, so  it's hard to find some that are not overly rich.  However, they have a decent variety of items you can order and some items for people who are not a fan of sushi.  I've never tried the hibachi because I am always in the mood for sushi, so I can't speak to those items.  As for sushi, their fish is generally fresh and tasty.  Their salmon, in particular, has always been spot-on when we've been there in terms of freshness and flavor.  I always order multiple pieces of nigiri with salmon.  The BBQ eel nigiri is tasty as well, with tender eel that is not chewy and a balanced sauce.  The mackeral, escolar, and yellowtail are always good as well.    The classic rolls are well done and tasty, but some of the specialty rolls are a little disappointing.  Most of them are covered in a lot of sauce.  A lot of them are deep fried, contain tempura items, or have added crunch to them, which is a little disappointing if you are looking for something a little lighter.  The Philadelphia Roll is a personal favorite, as is the Rainbow Roll.    In addition to nigiri and rolls, they have appetizers, soup, salad, and hibachi.  It's nice to have a little something for everyone, and for $18.99 for dinner you can get a great variety of food.  Sashimi is not included in the AYCE, but you can order pieces of sashimi for $.50 each piece and they are quite large pieces if you decide to add some.  All of the dishes are made to order and come out in a pretty reasonable time.  Some items take longer than others, so if you order several things they will bring them out as they finish (although they usually bring rolls out together, nigiri out together, and then cooked items as they finish).  Service is generally pretty good here and the place is almost always packed.  Make sure you don't order more than you can eat, as there is a charge if you don't finish.    Overall, there is a lot of love about My. Toyko because the food is good, the AYCE price is reasonable, and the service is good.",

This place is different from every Japanese restaurant that I have been in town. You write your name on the menu then you make your choices, it doesn't matter how much you order you will always pay $18,99 and they also have ice cream for free. (It is not on the menu though you have to ask for it) As you can see in my picture they have all kinds of options, from salad to hibachi and everything is delicious!  I always order squid salad, it is one of the best squids that I've ever had in my life.  Everything is made per order and it's fresh as it could be. The service is great, the place is clean and the food does not take long to be served. I have been going to this place for a year now and every time I want to have a blast with Japanese food  this is the place that I go to.  Besides the squid salad my favorites are cheese rangoon, shrimp tempura, steak hibachi with veggies, octopus, shrimp and salmon nigiri and the misso soup. They also have their regular menu in case your are not in the mood for the all you can eat menu. They do not take reservations and they are always packed so if you want to go on the weekends specially for dinner you need to get there early. But even if you have to wait it won't be for long and it is totally worth it!",

I didn't try the hibachi, I decided to load up and eat as much sushi as I could. The sushi was amazing. The fish tasted super fresh and the salmon had an brilliant buttery aftertaste. It was phenomenal! Our server did seem to disappear and wasn't around much, but the amount of delicious sushi I ate compared to the cost was unreal, so it honestly hardly bother me. This place is incredible, I highly recommend it and will be dining here often!",

Very comfortable. Greeted right away. Just check off what you'd like from the menu. Questions, just ask. My next surprise was when I saw how generous the servings were. Not all rice, to fill you up. Good selection of rolls. Now the service, it was outstanding also. I wish the name of our server was on the recipient,but it's not. She was great. Got there at noon and the place was busy but still didn't have long wait to get our food coming. It's not a very large place so be prepared for a possible wait. But we'll worth it. Can't wait to return.",

The sushi here is better than almost anywhere else in charlotte in the price range. For the price of 2 rolls(one and a half if go during lunch) at most places, you get all you can eat and it will be at least as good as, if not better than, wherever else you could go. I honestly dont know how they manage to provide so much high quality food while charging so (relatively) little.   Like I said, it's not the best sushi in town. If I want to spend 12 to 15 dollars on three pieces of amazing, mind blowing sushi, I go to futo buta or yamazaru. But, if I want a real meal that will fill me up and still make my taste buds happy, this is where I go. Every time. And that's not even mentioning their amazing wait staff.",

    "text": "I love sushi, and I can put down a lot of food.  So this place was made for me.  Went with my dad and brother on a Sunday.  All day buffet for $17.  Walked in, and the staff was very nice and welcoming.  They cleared a space for us immediately when we wanted a booth.  Very attentive, I always had a full glass of water.  No complaints about the service at all.  Now... the food. Sashimi you have to pay $0.50 extra per piece, but you don't have to for the Nigiri.  So we got a lot of that.  My favorite is the mackerel, and it was good.  Eel was good too.  I've gotta say, these guys have presentation on point.  Depending on how many pieces of nigiri you have, they lay them out on the plate nicely.  Good artistic use of space.  The appetizers:  BBQ squid was on point, nice and spicy, I wish I took a picture of it.  Agedashi tofu good.  Tempura was alright.  My dad got more tofu afterwards.  The rolls:  Standard, 8 pieces per order.  Spicy tuna, spicy crab, spicy salmon, sweet potato tempura, yellowtail, eel rolls all pretty good.  Above average buffet sushi.  You can order special rolls from their buffet sushi as well, and that's where they shined.  I only got the Mr. Tokyo roll.  It has black tobiko and MANGO on/in it.  I flipped out.  Really nice looking, delicious pieces of sushi.  My only regret is not ordering those from the start.  Next time I go, I'll definitely make up for my mistake.  Overall, a great experience.  My dad honestly isn't that big a fan of Japanese food, and he was like, \"Let's do this again before you leave for school.\"  I leave in two weeks.  I would've given this a 4 out of 5, because I've had a better sushi buffet in Raleigh.  But this place also overlaps a PokeStop.  And it got lured.  TWICE.  5 out of 5.",

    "text": "Okay. As much as I like sushi, I'm really upset no one has ever mentioned this place. Granted it's an hour+ away, but it is an hour I might actually drive for this place on occasion.  First off, let's just get this out of the way. This Sushi is an amazing quality! I've had sushi this good before, but never at an all-you-can-eat type place. The sushi melted in your mouth. I was amazed! Even the fried rolls felt delicate and perfectly fluffy. I'm not even sure how they achieved it! The fish all tasted extremely fresh. And the flavor combinations were excellent with so many options.  And speaking of options, I think it's time to discuss the all-you-can-eat aspect. At only $19 for the evening, it's already a steal if the sushi is at all good. But I already attested to how good it was Beyond expectations. But then you throw in the fact that it has so many options and it's unbelievable. Tons of normal cooked food options and appetizers including a really special Sushi appetizer you can only order one of per person at a time. It was layered fish and looked like a flower. Several different kinds of salads including seaweed salad. And the variety of roles in particular was remarkable.  To top it off our waiter was a lot of fun and helpful when discussing different types of sushi and their specialties. He was very friendly and engaging and made it even better. I'm not surprised this place is as well-reviewed as it is.",

    "text": "I've never been to an AYCE spot that includes the entire menu. Mr. Tokyo has an extensive menu of appetizers, soups, salads, entrees and sushi and it's ALL included in the price. On Saturday and Sunday, they run their dinner menu all day -- $16.99 AYCE. Their weekday lunch is a little cheaper ($10.99, I think) but a more limited menu.   We tried the seaweed salad, gyoza, spring rolls, shrimp tempura, chicken fried rice and 4 specialty rolls. We would have spent well over $40 just on the rolls alone anywhere else. Such a great deal! And, everything we tried was very good. My favorite, hands down, was the Charlotte roll. Next time we visit, my order will be 5 Charlotte rolls pleaseandthankyou. ;)   We arrived at 11:30am on a Saturday and the place was almost empty. While we ate, tables quickly filled up though. So, you might hit a short wait if you arrive in the prime lunch hour, between noon and 1pm. Service was friendly and attentive. All the food came out pretty quickly! We ordered in stages so as not to waste -- they do charge for excessive waste (we didn't get hit with anything because we cleared our plates) but are very upfront and honest about it. If you get an up charge, it's really no one's fault but your own.",

SERVICE: 2 stars - We ordered the all-you-can-eat dinner for four. Ordered 2 rounds and each round, there was something missing. Additionally, our waitress didn't speak English very well, so we'd start with asking her, then eventually always have to ask the main guy who spoke better English. Lastly, we had several dishes, but as they were finished, the waitress would come by and fill up our drinks but wouldn't think to take our dirty dishes, so they stacked up several times.  FOOD: 3 stars - at first, maybe it was bc we were hungry, it was good/ok. But by the 2nd round, the food seemed to be pretty bland and flavor range seemed limited, the food was either 1. COVERED in eel sauce 2. covered in avocado or rice   With that said, $17-18 pp is SUPER cheap for all you can eat, so I'm willing to give this place another chance when I come back to Charlotte!  Best of luck to you guys! Recommend offering all you can drink and eat option (beer + Sake for sake bombs) at the higher price!",

It's a poor concept and had I known that before going I would not have gone.  I don't ever take more than what can eat from buffets but at this place you have to order what you want...and they will not let you order only what you want to eat.  For example, they would not let me order nigiri without rice...and then charged extra because I didn't eat the rice.  Really stupid idea, and not a good way to make customers happy.  They should just charge whatever they need to charge and get rid of the fine print.  At a minimum they should allow any modifications so that people can get exactly what they want.  It's not even a great price, plenty of places in Charlotte offer BOGO sushi at least once a week where you can get full for less money and not deal with someone counting your leftovers.",

It took us about 10 minutes of questions with the excellent waitress to understand which parts of the menu were included in the all you can eat and how many pieces of sushi came with each roll- the rolls they cut come with 6-8 but the hand rolls and nigiri you just order how many you want. This is the best quality sushi we've ever eaten, but we both HATED the crunchy roll, a hand roll of seaweed and something crunchy and dry and something fishy in skinny squiggles- we ordered two pieces and they were giant and it was hard to make it through them but worth it not to pay extra! We added up what we ordered would have cost us and came out about $5 on top. This experience is definitely not for people new to sushi because you might order several things you don't like and end up in trouble. But we had a great time and can't wait to go back, next time with bigger appetites!",

It's less than a mile from my house. And don't judge a book by its cover. The location is not flashy but the inside decor is exquisite. Extremely clean. Better than surrounding restaurants like Nakato etc. And when they say all you can eat they really mean it. This means everything!! The soup, salad, appetizers, special rolls, you name it! Right now they charge an extra 50 cents for sashimi per order. I hope they change that in the future. If you live anywhere close to south Charlotte do yourself a favor and checkout Mr. Tokyo.",

    "text": "I have a lot of good and bad things to say about this place. Very disappointed at the customer service and the biased way the staff there treat their Asian customers. My first time there I left disappointed in the service. The sushi isn't bad and for the price who could complain, right? Well that's what I thought, the next weekend I come back again with a party of 5, being there before we all knew what we wanted to order. So we put in our order which was a pretty big order. About 120 sushi pieces all together including rolls. The waitress comes back asking if we are sure we will finish. We say yes. 30 secs later she comes back and says the party before us ordered pretty big too it will take a while are we okay with that? We tell her kindly, \"that's okay we can wait\". The workers start bringing out our appetizers and the sushi that is ready first. So we didn't complain even though we would've liked to get everything at once but oh well. We were all really disappointed because the salmon portion to the rice was ridiculously small. I will include a picture. Maybe the staff there thought to fill us up on rice so we will be charged extra since maybe we won't finish. (We finished everything we got the first round) we wanted to order a second because five adults do eat a lot of sushi. I wanted the mr Tokyo bowl, the boys ordered about 3 more rolls and another appetizer. I guess we ate too much of their food so the waitress comes back and tells me there's no more salmon for the Tokyo bowl. So I'm like okay that's fine. My party had been there for a while more than an hour and it was starting to be their busy hour but how is it the customers fault for staying there longer than usual when other parties order before you and you have to wait your turn for your sushi, get it? A waitress comes over to ask if we were done yet. We tell her yeah we are, we just have ice cream and then can someone bring us the check. I don't know about you guys but I hate being rushed. I just felt like it was so rude of the staff to feel the need to rush people out because we were there too long when we can't control how fast they make their sushi. Again, feeling mistreated because we were Asian. Once again, I will say the sushi is good and for the price and the way the business is set up it is so worth it if you are a sushi lover. But beware because sometimes the rice portion to the nigiri will disappoint you.",

Drinks left completely empty, order sheets waiting to be taken. You're better off sitting at the bar so at least you can hand the order sheet to the sushi chef.",

You won't find another sushi restaurant in South Charlotte on par with Mr Tokyo and that can beat its pricing and quality. We have revisited this restaurant numerous times and have yet to be displeased. Some might call us addicted",

This is the first one of its kind here in Charlotte  (I'm originally from here). The food was yummy and the service was great. I don't know if he was the owner, but the young gentleman with the glasses came over to talk to us after we finished. Very nice guy. Try the crabmeat salad! Great price for all you can eat!",
