They give you tons of pepperoni and it's crispy.  The crust is perfect.  It has a light crisp on the outside and is doughy on the inside, exactly what I expect from a sicilian.  This is my first order from here, and I will be back...but not like Arnold, more like a NY Italian transplant.  They factor in tips for delivery into the pricing, which I like, because it is something that a company that respects its employees would do.",

My husband raves about the deep dish pizza with \"turbo\" crust but I prefer the thin crust pizza because you get more of the toppings in each bite. Ordering is a snap, they have good specials and delivery is always prompt/friendly. I knocked off one star because at times, they are frugal with the cheese/toppings and the cheesy bread is tasteless. As for their pizza and salads- top notch; in our rotation when we need our monthly pizza fix!",

    "text": "As I may have mentioned before, I am forever on a quest here in Charlotte for a great pizza pie.  Knowing that Jet's has a deep dish pizza, I was quite excited to try it (especially since I had a Groupon to do so cheaply).  However, Jet's wasn't quite my cup of tea, so I will continue my quest.  My partner and I decided to try the Jet 10 pizza in deep dish and the Jet's Bread.  The bread used the same dough as the deep dish pizza, I am relatively certain.  However, the bread just didn't have enough garlic on it for my taste, so it was mostly just dough and cheese.  I really did not care for the marinara sauce there at all, as it was a very sweet marinara.  I am not at all a fan of sweet marinara sauces, so if you like them on the sweet side, this one is probably pretty good.  The bread itself was mildly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, so it had a good texture.  The portion size on the bread was pretty generous for the money, so that was good.  Not very often do you find places that have a square deep dish pizza.  You can't really see the outside crust, as the toppings go all the way out to the corners.  I was pretty excited about that.  I liked the variety of toppings on the Jet 10.  However, Jet's suffers from the same downfall of pizza chain deep dish in that it was mostly dough and easy on the toppings.  Again, their pizza sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, but if you like the sweet sauce at Pizza Hut (think big New Yorker or the stuffed crust), you will probably love the sauce.  I know that you can normally pick a flavor for the crust, but my impression was that you could not get that on the deep dish.  I am honestly not sure about that.  Now, dining in here is pretty great, I will say.  Our bread sticks came out in about 10 minutes, and they served them on a metal platter on a stand.  It was all very nice looking.  Our pizza came about 5 minutes later, also on a platter and stand.  The dining area was clean and not terribly cluttered at this location.  The employees were friendly and quick.  If you like a sweeter sauce on your pizza, I am guessing that you might appreciate this place a little more than I did.  Our pizza was hot and fresh, but very mediocre otherwise.  However, I am still holding out for a more perfect pizza place in the Queen City.",

It's also nice to drop in on a late evening or for lunch or anytime and grab the 2 slices for $5.00 with a fountain drink!  The Calzones are wonderfully delicious as well. I really think it is the crust with some sort of addictive chemical in it that makes you crave it nightly!! What ever it is it makes both the pizza and the calzone memorable in my book.",

We've had the meat lovers and also some veggie combo pizza, along with Jet's Bread and the hot wings. Everything was good and worth getting again.

    "text": "The ubiquitous pizza parlor in any given city under the sun doesn't have to shove into the long line of familiar menus, toppings and standard pizza accoutrement when you have the right variety. I am very pleased to say that Jet's does an exceptional job and makes for a great experience to be had.   Met a friend here for lunch and was excited to see their quick service set up for dine-in lunchers. Very clean spot with ample seating, a generously sized soda/silverware station and huge windows for plenty of natural lighting. The interior is very clean and simple. Just the way any quick service joint should be!  The pizza was fantastic. I'm not one for going with \"old reliable,\" but pepperoni was a great choice. The aspects that really make their pie choices are the different crusts. Deep dish with \"turbo\" crust comes highly recommended. Cool thing about it is that you don't have to pay any extra for special types of crust! The deep dish is so crispy on the bottom and entire exterior, the cheese is perfectly melted and even pooled together around the crust and the pepperoni was slightly crispy and flavorful. Each bite was a well-balanced mix of textures and flavor. The two of us killed a large no problem!   Family friendly and I mean...come on. Pizza is always good when you can get it to go! Excited to come back to Jet's and sample some of their other crusts and topping options. Great job!",

It reminded me of my favorite pizza place in SF. You can also get pizza by the slice. Great fast service and quality pizza. Take me back please!",

    "text": "Finally a pizza joint with excellent Sicilian Pizza (square)  pizza or as Jets calls it \"Deep Dish\". I usually request the bottom be cooked well done as I find their deep dish can sometimes be soggy in the middle. I was not a fan of the NY style pizza or their salads but they still get 5 stars because the deep dish makes up for it all.   You can pick up or have your order delivered and the staff always seems to find me a coupon that they can apply to my current order. How awesome is that? Jets you keep this type of service up and I may just have to dine with you more than once a week :)",

    "text": "I certainly don't mind the floppy, thin-crust-style NY pizza. But nothing beats a great deep dish, and Jet's has some GREAT deep dish pizza. Very fresh, vibrant flavors and incredible prices. The turbo stick are good too - with varieties in cheese, cheese and bacon, and cheese and pepperoni.  The salads are pretty good, too. I've not yet tried their sandwiches, but am eager to - the delicious thick crust pizza dough serves in place of bread.  Best part - their lunch combos. Killer food for $5.  Now, I'm feeling some confusion over whether or not they deliver to the area (I see the cars, but the employees say they don't).  Hopefully that gets resolved soon.  Very glad to see Jet's in town!",

It was SOOOOO GOOD - crunchy ends, enough cheese - just wonderful! It was like a flashback of Charlotte in the 1970's for me, of going to La Srada Pizza on Central Avenue - back when it used to be GOOD!  Back to my Jet's review, I may have to branch out and get their full size deep dish pizza.  I'm telling you, that crust was amazing!  That being said, I also can't wait to try their thin crust pizza - looks like they have a great selection.  I also ordered a Greek salad. Wasn't especially impressed with it and did not care for their Greek dressing at all; I've had worse - but also have had much better.  I will def be trying their wings the next time I go.",

It was a little oily but the flavor was DELISH. I ordered delivery, (we all feel a little lazy sometimes) and when it arrived the carrier apologized for being late. I hadn't even noticed! But he was kind and polite and assured me the pizza was still hot.  I opened the box to a scrumptious looking deep dish pizza and honey BBQ wings. Everything was yummy. The meat to cheese ratio was acceptable and the crust was crunchy, buttery, awesomeness.   Guess what!  I will try them again! Go on, everyone. Have no fear.
