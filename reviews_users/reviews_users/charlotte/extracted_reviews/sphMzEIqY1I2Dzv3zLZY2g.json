I mentioned it to Shannon a co-owner, she seemed not to care.  But they sure like selling drinks while you wait for no service.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu, we had no other choice.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  We were offered cocktails 3 times, we still had cocktails yet they still tried to sell us more.",

Amy wife had the duck and it was very good also and cooked perfectly. Verh nice savory yet sweet taste that she loved. Definitely a spot for people thag enjoy creative dishes.

Always very accommodating, I have hosted two corporate dinners at Global and everyone in attendance has praised the service, food and experience.",

So, I had no choice but to heck this place out.  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience! Aside from being in a business park, the ambiance was nice and the inside was well decorated. The food was good and I couldn't have eaten much more after an appetizer and main course. The prices weren't too bad as well.  My only complaints: The waiter obviously didn't know too much about the food, he kept stumbling over his words while describing the dishes. Also, one of the employees had brought there kid as he kept running around. It was quite annoying but I am not a big fan of kids.",

    "text": "I had the esteemed honor of working for Chef Bernard during the opening of his new location, and I can safely say I have not met anyone more entitled and arrogant in my adult life. I worked for two weeks without pay, after being promised compensation, putting together the tables you sit at during your foray into what may be the most banal dining experience in all of Charlotte. The man, and his wife, scare away talented and well meaning people as if it is very rapidly going out of style. The grill chef Corey is one of the most bush league cooks in fine dining I will have the displeasure of working with, don't be surprised if your entree is overcooked. The playlist will play advertisements during service, so perk up your ears, as no one seems to notice, over the modern drivel. I think an establishment such as this must only attract the tone deaf and senseless, seeking any place which doesn't serve biscuits. The cost of food is atrocious, for a 3 dollar portion of ribeye or duck you will be charged 30 dollars, a brazen display the infinite nerve and sense of grandiose delusional entitlement of this place and owner. Speaking of place, it is oddly situated by some rail road tracks in a row of mind numbing antique stores, which actually is perfect, nevermind. The decor is sickeningly modern in a turn of the century building. Clueless people completely out of touch with anything than acquiring your money. I don't think there is much of a love of anything else. While employed there frequently we would be scolded for ruining their dream, which in all reality is a nightmare. It has two floors and the service staff has to truck your food and dirty dishes up and down all night, because, who doesn't love a sweaty faced server when you are paying 30 dollars a plate. And a dumb waiter was out of the question, because the owner was swindled out of a large portion of the building costs by someone who maybe dealt the blow which was coming to these utterly draconian owners/usurious crooks. Notice the plywood which was painted dark grey to hide the fact that it's cheap plywood at the bar. This place is all show, and it doesn't take more than a visit to recognize the fact it's vacuous and hollow at its core. I will never work for someone again who has such utter contempt for those who toil for him, and as he approached me to work for him, and never gave any respect to the fact that I worked for him for nothing to make this nightmare come True, it was a tumultuous bitter life lesson. Oh, and there are cockroaches. Bon appetit!",

Now we just know what to order next time:  Appetizers: The portions are perfectly sized (not as small as Good Food, but not like something from Maggiano's either).   Quail: I really like quail and the menu indicated that this was their \"signature dish\" so I figured it would be outstanding. This was the only app we didn't finish. It was not very good at all (again, coming from someone who generally loves quail)  Berkshire Pork Belly: Described by our waiter as a \"big piece of bacon\" it was pretty flavorful, but definitely on the fatty side.  I know that is the definition of pork belly but I can see how it would be off-putting to some. I really enjoyed the bed of lentils it came on. We finished it but wouldn't order it again.  Eggplant and Greek Olive Spring roll: THIS is what I am talking about.  This was by far our favorite dish of the night. It comes with a goat cheese and honey sauce that is good enough to drink. I'm going to try to replicate it for sure.   We also shared the sea bass entree which was very good. They put the Sriracha on the side since my husband doesn't really care much for spicy.   Split the nougat glace dessert which was incredible. It reminded me of a dessert I had in St. Barth's on our honeymoon. Not too heavy or sweet, but just enough to hit the spot!   The restaurant was slammed, so the service was a little slow, but still very friendly. A quaint, cozy and delicious restaurant that was not at all stuffy.  Definitely a nice change of atmosphere!",

It's one thing to make people wait more than an hour (2 hours in our case) for a meal but it's another not to recognize that your customers were upset. We literally left our desert uneaten and left our appetizer on the plate because it was served cold. Our waitress seemed extremely shy and not attentive. The chef did come out and speak with us and said they would work on the issues in the future but really did not apologize or offer to remove the plates from our bills. I really wanted this restaurant to be good. I like the atmosphere and location but I cannot stand poor customer service. Every restaurant makes mistakes, the key is to recognize them and to keep your customer coming back. In my case, this restaurant do not meet our expectations.",

We came here with a group of 10 for my birthday last weekend after I had suggested it to my friends after coming once before. I expected the food to be overpriced and small portions but from my last experience it was good. Last weekend was awful and I have never been treated so terribly by any employee at a restaurant. My friend found a hair in her shrimp crudette and after mentioning it to the server she took the plate away and didn't offer to bring something else. At the end of the night we asked if we could speak to the manager/owner because the server insisted we would have to pay $3 dollar per person for a cake cutting fee to eat my birthday cake even though we had brought plates and utensils and a cake cutter and said we would cut it ourselves. After spending hundreds this didn't seem like it was too much to ask. The owner came out with a very bad attitude and spoke down to me with no respect and basically told me off and blamed my friend for the hair in her food. I was so humiliated and will definitely not be returning or recommending this place to anyone.",

Last evening we decided to give it another go as we were looking for some place to visit prior to watching Thursday night NFL game. One of our neighbors mentioned 1/2 price drafts and NFL chicken wing specials. Beer was fantastic, but wings were under cooked, tasteless, so terrible I wouldn't feed these to my dogs! Price for (4) wings was $8.00 per person...if not mistaken, this averages out to $2.00 per wing!  Price paid for two drafts, 8 wings with gratuity $29.00.  If a restaurant is going to survive in Pineville they should take another look at their menu and provide good food at sensible prices. There are many other establishments in this area like Harper's which have better offerings.",

She Crab soup was outstanding, with delicious chunks of crab and the cream added was just the right amount. Pork belly....I mean it's PORK BELLY! Thick bacon cut with lentils so it was YUMMY!  My date got the Scallops and I got the Paella. Both were really good. Her scallops were better than my Paella, but don't get me wrong, the Paella was really good! It's just that I'm spoiled when it comes to Paella. Cafe Ba Ba Reba in my hometown of Chicago and Segovia's in Toronto really ruined it for me when juding Paella! Nonetheless, Global's Paella was good.  The dessert. OMG! Their Nougat Glace was phenomenal! Very classic French presentation and preparation. It's basically a very light ice cream, but so much better! I'd highly recommend this if you come here!  Overall a wonderful meal!",

    "text": "Tucked off the beaten path in Ballentyne is this little gem. Would never have known about it had it not been for the Charlotte Citipass coupon...this little book has been a harbinger to many a great dining experience.   One of the few fine dining restaurants in Charlotte that attempts to step outside the boundaries of normal gastronomy. The words \"safe, unambitious\" will not appear as adjectives to describe any of the three dishes I consumed during my wife's birthday dinner. I began the adventure with the chefs soup Du jour, Braised Boar and Rice Soup. Fantastic starter, if a bit on the salty side. I've never been afraid of a little sodium, so I consumed every last drop.   For a main course, I again chose one of the chefs specials; Duck Breast, with a cauliflower puree, bean puree, broccoli rabe, finished with a honey gelee (read: honey jello). Now, I'm not usually one to fall all over themselves for kitchen gimmickry (i.e. honey jello squares garnishing the plate, purees of this and that, finished with an emulsion of blah blah, etc.); I prefer to let the locally grown ingredients (which this place boasts) speak for themselves. However, in this instance, I was pleasantly surprised at how all the flavors played off one another. The insanely bitter-but-delicious Broccoli rabe, paired with the sweet honey and savory fatty duck, was sublime. My only critique would be the two purees on the plate (albeit very delicious purees). Fortunately, the crunch of the lightly sauteed broccoli and crispy skin of the duck breast swooped to the rescue with just enough texture to save the dish from becoming a plate of baby food accoutrement.   For desert, I always play it safe. If a menu declares creme brulee, then creme brulee I do order. I don't know what it is about this simple, delicious vanilla custard that commands my attention. Being a purist, I prefer the vanilla bean creme brulee over other variations, but Global forced me outside of my traditional boundaries (just as they had with the two previous courses) by serving me a trio of brulees; a mocha and a chocolate brulee accompanied my vanilla go-to. And I was happy to have the experience! Chef Bernard came out at the conclusion of the meal to make sure everything was to our liking.  This little touch is lost in today's culinary world, but greatly appreciated by myself and my fellow diners.  I hope this place makes it; an odd location in a seemingly abandoned business park, coupled with the menu being prohibitively expensive for many a dining budget, will make it challenging. Fortunately, I believe that Chef Bernard (executive chef) and his wife Shannon (front of the house) are up to the challenge!",

Not only was the experience a memorable one for our mid-week anniversary, but it was possibly the best restaurant experience I have had in Charlotte.  We took some special out of town guests downtown a few years ago to a well-recognized old traditional Charlotte restaurant, and spent (with tip) over twice the amount spent tonight per person (without discount) for a nice dinner, wine, dessert, etc. in a dining room that was way too dark to see our entrees.  It was fine, but based on comparisons to other US large city dining experiences we have had, not really that special.  Next time we want to show off Charlotte to our out of town guests, we will definitely come to Bernard.  We had a wonderful appetizer tower with 3 exceptional choices, with our favorite being a tossup between the steak tartare and the spring roll.  We ordered the duck and the beef tenderloin as our entrees, and although the beef was very good, the duck was truly superb.  We shared the nougat dessert and had brandy and coffee to finish out our evening.  I have no criticism to offer, just a hearty recommendation.  I cannot imagine that you would be disappointed.  Bernard lets his food be the star of his show - he does not need anything else to make your evening truly exceptional.",

Some colleagues and I did an initial \"site visit\" or \"test run\" as a group of four.  We all agreed it was definitely the place to return for the larger business dinner!  One of my colleagues, who is a real \"foodie\", proclaimed that it was the best meal he had eaten in Charlotte!  Others, who live in Charlotte, said they did not know about The Global, but would be coming back now that they knew.  Bernard, the owner/chef, worked with me on the larger dinner party to determine a pre-set menu with my choice of wine.  The wine menu, btw, is top of the line!  Not the run of the mill, same old stuff.  Excellent explanations of a variety of bottles you don't see everywhere else. Bernard obviously works with wholesalers who carry something different.  The food and service at The Global are top notch.  Bernard is charming.  See the other reviews for more on the food. The location is truly a bit different, in an office park. It is in a nice area, so don't let that deter you.  If you are tired of chain restaurants, and desire a nice ambience, with interesting, well thought out, excellent food and wine - make reservations for a table at The Global.  Everyone that has been there with me, now has it on their list. You get what you pay for, and the value for what you pay here is well worth it.",

We shared the Moroccan Delight for an appetizer, then had the Paella and Pork Tenderloin.  We ended dinner with the Nougat Glace, which was well worth the calories!  The chef even came out and spoke to every table to ensure everybody's dinner was perfect.  Service was outstanding.",

I ordered an appetizer from the menu for the entire table BEFORE the last three in my party arrived.  45minutes AFTER my party of six was seated the appetizers arrived.  We were already on our second round of cocktails.   The food I rate \"so-so\".  I go to a lot of fine dining restaurants,  So I believe I know fine food.  The presentation was very nice, but the taste and quality left a lot to be desired.  This restaurant is not on my recommended list, and it will be a long time before I even think about returning to this restaurant.",

My husband however was very disappointed with his boneless short ribs.  Minus the pickled carrots there was no flavor and it left him hungry.  Lastly, the service wasn't anything to write home about.  We noticed a much better camaraderie from the servers with the locals and felt like they honestly couldn't have cared less about us.",

    "text": "I am giving Global 5 Stars- yet the Restaurant Week performance was a tough 3.5-4.  With that I will be back- often. The smaller closeness in size and ambience sets a quaint comfortable mood with its is low lights, makes you want to stay all night long! Unfortunately they just weren't staffed adequately or prepared for the bombardment of Restaurant Week. The Food was amazing, truly inventive & tasteful (fine dining at its best!), Bernard the owner was so gracious and appreciative, and bless our waiter, he was well-professionally-trained and tended to us as best he could, but the rest of the establishment was working against him.   Read below for Restaurant Week experience:  Upon arrival (7:45) our table was not ready (rsvp'd for 8, which is fine, we were early) so we went to the bar for a drink while we waited. While we saw plenty of people working and fluttering behind the bar, apparently only one lady was a bar tender(?), a wine, another wine, a beer and the 4th in our group ordered a Dark & Stormy...she snapped with a horrible attitude \"we can't make that\" and took off to go get the drinks she could get - didn't ask him if he wanted anything else, or offer what she could make him- her attitude was that of Frazzled and frustrated and unhappy to have a job and be working. She was like this to everyone, shitty & snappy to co-workers (we felt bad for them!) and to guests. She should not be at this kind of establishment, she belongs at an Applebee's.  She got the rest of us or drinks and our table was ready upstairs. 3 of us with drinks, 1 nothing. We sat for 10-15 min (the drinkless member pretty pissed) and our over worked waiter arrived. He was calm, patient and could feel our discomfort. He took new drink orders and gave us menu highlights and did his best.  He was over-seated, too many tables with no support for drink, bread or water runners, and a slow bar with a pissy bar tender and slow kitchen were not his fault - and he handled like a freaking champ! I applaud his attitude and ability, it isn't easy to walk into a storm!  With the bar down stairs, drinks were slow to arrive, and they ran out of the beer the guys were drinking - so they had to switch -- but when the food did come, it was so amazing, the food was so flavorful and unique, it went miles to help us forget our judgments of the flaws in the evening.  I am 100% confident the inconsistencies we experienced were due to Restaurant Week, and that any other normal night, Global kills it.  I plan to come back, at a slower paced night (hopefully the bar tender has her attitude adjusted- especially for this caliber of a restaurant) for a much more fun evening!!",

Everything we order was out.  The restaurant didn't seem really busy at all.  My wife had the ribeye steak and it was okay.  You can't really mess that up.  I had the lamb pave which was really disappointing.  The meat was very chewy and the cut of the meat was more of like prime ribs but tasted like lamb.  The rice or grains that came with it was hard and the sauce was bland.  The dessert was okay but once again what we wanted was out.  The chocolate dessert I felt like it was old and tasted like it came from sams club.    I thought a 4 star restaurant would be better than this but really was disappointed.  Maybe we went on the wrong day because yelp has always been right.  When I go to a 4 star restaurant I would expect the food to be more tasteful.  Our bill was about $120 which included a bottle of wine.  Even the wine we ordered, it was 2012 on the menu but they brought a 2013.    The only good experience I had was at the end of dinner the chef came out and greet us.  He's from France and my wife spoke French being from Montreal, they had a quick conversation.  I love good service but I wish the food was better.  The service was ok.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my friends and would not come back myself but if you want to try it yourself I would recommend not getting the lamb.",

This also was my first time dining in Charlotte, and we picked the place due to the rating and nice reviews. To make a long story short they had only 2 options for entries out of the whole menu, and they don't bother to tell that to people who call to make a reservation and then wait for a table. We had to wait for an hour to get the food. The food was not what we've expected and was cold too. A couple at the table close to us started talking to us and share that they've been waiting way too long to get the food and now they have it cold. But they ate up, didn't say a word and left. We said we don't want the food, and want to be out of here. I didn't even care what they charge us. They charged only for the food we ate. But then their Chef came out and started furiously at me with a question of how dear I to order a well-done duck and then not eat it. Then he referred to what he thought my cultural background was which I found highly inappropriate and rude. Then we waited for another 10 minutes to pay the bill and get out. I would rate it less than 1 star if I could.",

We also had a complaint about a hair in our food and were charged to serve cake we brought. Now, what makes this a 1 star review is how the owner responded to our questions. Instead of apologizing or trying to make things right, he was incredibly hostile and argumentative right from the start. Through thinly veiled aggression, he reluctantly agreed to let us eat our own cake free of charge, but he was so sarcastic and dismissive about it none of us felt comfortable staying in his restaurant. At that price point you expect great food and excellent customer service, neither of which this restaurant had. The most unfortunate part for the owner was that we were by far his biggest table at the time and the place was dead silent on a Friday evening. It won't be long until they're out of business and Its not the food to blame.",

    "text": "I had always driven by this place and wanted to stop in.  I finally did last Friday evening.  I was alone and sat at the bar to have some drinks and dinner.  It took a while before anyone acknowledged me.  The lady behind the bar was busy chit chatting with another couple.  After I was finally acknowledged i asked for a drink/wine list and ordered a glass of wine.  Looking at the menu, as usual in a lot of places, there are not many vegetarian choices.  I ordered the cheese plate which I was very excited about (until i received it) and what i thought was BEET tartar.   When my food came the cheese plate was little to be desired.  There were 4 kinds of cheeses, but not enough of each to even put on a saltine cracker.  While it was delicious, way too small portions for the $15 price.  and the BEET tartar i was excited about turned out to be BEEF instead.  I looked at it, thinking \"this doesn't look like Beets\" and looked on the menu to see if maybe the bartender misunderstood me but there was no other dish on the menu called Beef tartar that i saw... so I stupidly took a bite.  It was Beef!  I just ate a poor dead cow! I finished my smidgen of cheeses before anyone ever came back to check on me and asked the bartender what i was served.  I told her the menu said BEET.  She showed me the menu and the one i had was printed badly and the letters of the BEEF/BEET were cut off, making it look like BEET... Then she showed me the other menus and said \"See, it is BEEF!\"  Which was much more legible on the other menus.   She offered to give me some fried avacado instead, which I accepted because I was still quite hungry after my $15 cheese plate.  But rather than arguing with me and proving  her point to me by showing me other menus ... she had no idea what it was like for a vegetarian of 20 years to eat beef.  She was not understanding or compassionate of the situation whatsoever and made it into my fault.   After finishing my wine I asked for my bill and left.  That is not a place i will ever go to again - and reading other negative comments from other customers reinforces my opinion even more.",

    "text": "On Thursday nights we go to Kit's Trackside Crafts for music bingo in downtown Pineville. We usually eat dinner first at the Corner Grind. Unfortunately a couple of weeks ago a drunk driver drove through their front window so they are closed for repairs right now. The only other restaurant that was available on main street was Global Restaurant. We decided to walk down and get food to go to take back to the bar with us for music bingo. We walked in and no one greeted us. The hostess stand was empty. There was a bartender behind the bar but he didn't really acknowledge us. Eventually we wandered over to the bar and sat down and told them that we would like to order food to go. They were mildly friendly which was a plus after having no one greeted us when we walked in the door. The prices were out of this world outrageous! So we ordered just a few appetizers to go because really it was the only thing we could afford compared to what we usually eat on Thursday nights.  My husband eats low-carb so there were not very many options for him. He ended up ordering wings because that was basically all he could get.  I ordered a cheese plate and spinach artichoke dip with wonton chips. Our friends placed their own order which was just two cups of soup. We proceeded to wait an ungodly amount of time for our food to be ready. I'm pretty sure it took about 45 minutes to get our meager order cooked and bagged up and ready to go. It seems preposterous because there was hardly anyone even in the restaurant. I don't know why it took so long. The whole reason why we went to Global was because we were too hungry to wait for food to be delivered by door dash. We would have been better off doing that in the end. We took our food and went back to Kit's. When we unboxed our food, we were beyond disappointed. None of the containers were full. The dip barely filled half the cup and the wonton chips were extremely greasy. My husband's 8 wings didn't even come with celery. But, the kicker was the cheese platter. It cost $15 and it was the saddest cheese platter I have ever seen in my life. It looked like leftovers from a cheese platter that a previous group had already demolished. The Corner Grind also has a cheese platter and it only costs $12 and has 3 times as much food on it. I will attach the saaaad photo. These meager offerings ended up costing us $40!!  And, we were still hungry!!  Don't bother with Global Restaurant.",

We celebrated my wife's birthday upstairs and it was wonderful. We each (3 of us) had 4 courses and everyone loved their dishes. The waiter was excellent, was engaging, knowledgeable about the menu, personable but not to much. We came back a week later and sat outside, and along with the rest of the appetizers that we enjoyed, we had the best burger we have ever had.   We love good food, I am not one for over the top presentations. The food may look good but does it taste good? And it did INDEED! Well done!",

Pineville will no longer be compressed with chain restaurants if the community continues to open restaurants such as the Global Restaurant.   I ordered the She Crab Soup, Beef Tartare and Mac n Cheese. PHENOMENAL FLAVORS!   The soup was a beautiful blend of crab, sherry and cream. It's silky with chunks of sweet crab in every bite. The tartare was definitely my favorite, as it had a slight smokiness that married well with the vinaigrette and pickled veggies served with it.  The mac n cheese was creamy with hints of several cheeses blended together. Although bacon and I have a troubled history, I felt the risk was worth it as it wasn't overcooked nor did it overpower the dish.  I am urging everyone to venture into downtown Pineville and travel the Global's menu (no passport needed). From the elegant wallpaper upon entering to the superb service rendered, you will not be disappointed.",

The She Crab soup was fantastic. Had the entree with scallops, potatoes and spaghetti squash. The combination of the flavors with the sriracha sauce on the side was a home run. I prefer my scallops more on the well done side, but they were great. The wine selection was more than adequate, with a nice selection across price ranges. We chose the Sea Pearl Sauvignon Blanc, and it went well with our selections. After reading, you may be wondering why I am giving Global three stars. Simple: I don't agree with a separate charge for two people splitting an entree. My girlfriend and I are conscious about what and how much we eat. We split entrees routinely, for this very reason. It was disheartening to see a $5 split entree charge added to a bill that was over $100. Seems a little \"chincy\" to me, and not appreciated. We did enjoy an after meal cocktail at the bar before leaving. Overall a good experience, and I may go back.",

    "text": "Located in a quaint, little strip in Pineville, this restaurant offers upscaled menu and a warm, inviting dining experience.  Bottom level of this restaurant is catered toward a more casual crowd, and the top level serves a more formal crowd (but not much in terms of upscaled ambiance).  Initially, I was disappointed with the sparse menu selection...as there are literally less than half a dozen items on the main menu.  Since not too thrilled with the skimpy main selection (with surprisingly snobby pricing), I ordered their specialty soup and two appetizers (and dessert) in its place.  The appetizers, Beef Tartare and Mac 'n Cheese, were good...but not great.  However, I was very impressed with the She Crab soup and the Creme Brulee, which came in a cute, TRI-medley presentation.  I came with a group, and some of the entrees that others ordered looked quite delicious, so I might have written off their entrees too soon.  Also, the service was very friendly and down-to-earth...just what you'd expect in a restaurant situated in this quaint, little area of town.  For these reasons, I would definitely consider returning at a future date.  However, if I'm craving a truly upscaled dining experience in this price category ($30 and up), I would probably opt for several other restaurant choices in its place.",

I arrived early and was pleasantly greeted by Jamie, the bartender. She was very attentive and friendly.  I asked her to make my own \"special\" drink and she did so with a smile. Shannon, the owner-I hope I got her name right, was very approachable and friendly as well. She even mentioned my drink Jackson Sunshine may be on the menu this summer!   My friends & I were promptly seated upstairs where Jessica was our server. She was very pleasant and answered all of our questions with a smile. The food was amazing! Everything was cooked  well and beautifully presented! I've heard of some upscale restaurants have attitudes with Restaurant Week diners. This is something I've  never understood because they could be your next regular customer. I am happy to say I will definitely be returning to Global not only because of the delicious food but because of the excellent service!",

    "text": "Global is like two restaurants in one.  Downstairs is casual and open and upstairs is more classy and elegant.  On the night our trip through the Charlotte area, there was a wine tasting event downstairs so we were given a lovely table upstairs near a window.    We began the evening with some local craft beer and the Beef Tartare from the starter menu.  The beef was properly chilled and the extras were good.  Our only complaint is the description says it comes with local pickled vegatables but we only recieved two small pieces of cauliflower :(  Moving on, we enjoyed a delicious bottle of red wine with Carolina Shrimp small plate.  Everything on the plate was tasty, though a bit too room temp...  Next, Schweety had the Baby Lettuce Salad with had a nice mix to it and I had the Mussels, which I will say was some of the best that I've ever had.    Service was friendly and knowledgeable with the the right amount of attentiveness!",

I ordered the duck, I even asked the people working their if it was any good, they said Yes, very good!!    First it came in a card board to go box and nothing on the bottom to stop wetness from coming through the card board  Second it had a horrible smell like old garbage, but since I just spent about 34$ on a meal the size of an appetizer I figured I might as well try it.  Third the duck was barely even warm, more like room temperature and it wouldn't chew, it was so chewy had to be spit out and was about impossible to eat.  Tasted like unseasoned pig feet.  Forth It had some sort of peach medly under the duck that was cold like it just came out the refrigerator.  The peaches and what ever else that mess was looked cooked but were very cold with no flavor to them.    Most disgusting meal I think I've ever tried.  I don't see how this establishment will stay in business or how they managed to have such good reviews.   Tried 3 bites to much, thank God Outback's open till 10",

    "text": "Downtown Pineville is a small quaint place that offered me a recent surprise in the form of THIS restaurant.   There was a team dinner being hosted here and I can admit that I didn't initially understand why, of all places, our company would want to bring visiting colleagues here... but I ALSO was not prepared for the ambiance that I walked into. Walking into this place, there was upscale decor, beautiful bar and southern hospitality which made me excited about the four course meal that were about to indulge. Since I had some time to spare, while others arrived, I enjoyed an Autumn Mule at the bar...try it and thank me later.   Once everyone arrived, we followed the hostess upstairs to a private dining area and it was setup so beautifully. I literally walked in and made a mental note of this place being an option for a future event. Since we were enjoying a private dinner, our menu was custom and offered our company logo at the top. There was a slight change to the selections, different than what were initially told, so the chef came to our table to personally let us know why the changes were made. I appreciated that touch because the waitress could have just said \"we don't have it\" and left it at that; again, the southern hospitality was well appreciated. Once the wine selections were poured, everything else from orders being taken to our dessert was brought out seamlessly.   I don't recall all the names of the our menu items, but I do know that if you're there... please try their Berkshire Pork Belly to start off your meal. After first bite, I immediately thought about having another with grits (I wasn't the only one at the table with this thought) it was so tender and tasteful. For my main course, I enjoyed their Maple Leaf Farm Duck.. it was also tender and seasoned to the heavens.   I'm glad I was able to try this place out and I cannot wait to go back to enjoy dinner with them again. Oh, and there is a public parking lot just at the end of the block so it's not a far walk (if you cannot find street parking)...You'll also be thankful for the short walk when you're leaving with a full belly. Hope to see you there!",

We had a drink at the bar and then were seated by the front window at a cozy table on a Friday night (March 15, 2019). So far, so good.   We tried the cheese plate and the mussels as appetizers. Both were fairly pricey and extremely small portions. The mussels did not have much flavor at all, and the cheese plate was completely unremarkable.   After that, I had the she crab soup. That's the one standout on the menu, and I've added a star to the review for that alone.   Then, we waited half an hour for the entrees to emerge. The wait was fine - better than that than rushed - but could be annoying to some and did not suggest a well run restaurant.   The entrees were the biggest disappointment. I paid over thirty dollars for a plate of fettuccine and two scallops. Definitely could have been, and often is, cooked much better at my house. And I'm no great chef.   My wife had the lamb (also over $30), and received an anemic portion. If there was more than three ounces of lamb on her plate, I would be shocked. Preparation was just ok. Again, I've done better cooking lamb at home.   The complete menu itself is very limited. I appreciate the thought behind having a small menu and doing it well, but for that to work you have to do it well. Global serves a similar offering to many of the better restaurants in CLT and comes out bottom of the heap.   Overall, with wine, we left with a bill over $200. If the food had been, in portion size or quality, anywhere near the top twenty restaurants in CLT, that price may be understandable. But it just wasn't good (except for the soup!).   The ambiance is just odd. They've done a great thing by using an early twentieth century Main Street space, and I like the exposed brick and wood. But the music was abysmal (this space needs a jazz soundtrack, not a Chick-Fil-A soundtrack). But the bathrooms seem to dominate the space, the chairs look flimsy and like they were donated by Target, and the lighting is odd. On our visit, the place was festooned with cheap St. Patrick's decorations, which seemed inconsistent with any kind of style or cohesive high end vibe.   Over the two plus hours we were there, the restaurant never got particularly busy. This is not dispositive but suggests that others feel as we did about this restaurant. Won't be back.",

Our server took his time to explain the menu and gave us amazing recommendations on what food we might prefer.  During our meal the chef came out and spoke to us and he was the sweetest person I have ever spoken to!  I would honestly make a trip back to Rock Hill specifically to eat at this restaurant a million times over. If you're looking for a great evening, with great food and a great selection of alcohol, this is THE place to experience all of that and then some. Thank you Global for making my six year anniversary unforgettable",

No fighting over prime parking spots.  Oh and the food!!! Squash blossoms stuffed to perfection with pimento cheese. The best pork belly I've ever had with a mouthwatering blackberry jam. Steak Pave that was so tender, we didn't need steak knives... and seasoned just right. Then the desserts. Oh the desserts!! Lemon curd with lavender biscuits tasted just like Mom's when she pulled fresh lemons off our tree. And the Nougat Glace was devoured in seconds.  This little gem in Pineville is changing the food scene!!! Do yourself a favor and make a reservation before they book up this weekend. Wow! Just wow!!!",

The menu was awesome with lots of great choices. Our waiter was phenomenal but the wait for the food was a bit long. The appetizers were not great. The mussels were passed their prime so to speak and the pork belly was good but not enough punch in the sauce to counteract the fatty meat. The scallops were the best I've ever had. I love scallops and these were cooked to perfection. The pork chop was also amazing and cooked to perfection as well. I would add a little more of the tomato sauce smear as it was very tasty. Overall it's a great place to have a romantic dinner.",

You never know how these sort of things will go but I must say the wine distributor was knowledgeable and charismatic.  So was chef Bernard and his wife.  Thank you for hosting.  You made me look like a real hero for finding this.

Downstairs has a bar with a more casual setting and different menu then upstairs.  We dined upstairs, one of only two tables that night. After reviewing the menu I was a little disappointed with the limited options and how high the prices were. Several of us started with appetizers, from the She Crab Soup to Octopus. I had the She Crab Soup, smelled a little fishy at first but was good. Not the best I've ever had. Bread was served which was a little stale. For my entree, I actually chose two appetizers (as I was not th with the entree options). I had the Beef Tartare and Prosciutto Macaroni & Cheese. Both good, but nothing great. The Macaroni & Cheese was somewhat dry and seemed day old. Others had the Lamb, Duck and Scallops. Everyone seemed to enjoy their Entrees.  Overall, the service and food was good, but I had higher hopes.",

Good things come to those who wait -- our experience was fabulous.  The restaurant was not too crowded on a weeknight, so we were seated in the more casual downstairs venue.  It still felt like a nice night out.  My husband ordered the Sweet Potato Gnocchi and gave me a taste.  It had a very nice taste and texture that was brightened by the orange in the mascarpone crema. I ordered the Diver Scallops and was not disappointed! The kohlrabi slaw provided a nice counterbalance to the creamy scallops and the house siracha gave a nice punctuation to the plate without being overly spicy.  As others have mentioned, Chef Bernard did make an appearance at our table to ensure that we were enjoying our meal.  All in all -- it was a delicious treat!",

The food is just okay, and the prices are too high for what you get. On our most recent trip, the service was pretty abysmal with no one saying a word to us when we sat down at the bar, even though a bartender was literally right in front of us.

Nice location in downtown Pineville since it was on the main street it was easy to find and plenty of close parking. We stepped in and the place was pretty full.  Nice bar and seating area, but they also had a setup upstairs where we went.  I felt bad for the waitresses walking up and down but once I tasted the delicious offerings my lack of empathy kicked in.  On to the food! Sweetie and I split a She Crab Soup and once it came we were immediately sorry we didn't get our own bowls.  It was delightful and rivaled any She Crab that I've had in the \"big\" seafood areas like Charleston.  It was creamy, well seasoned, and quite honestly soul saving.  You can tell the person that made it knew what they were doing. I ordered the Diver Scallops and Sweetie had the Sea Bass.  Scallops were big and Gordon Ramsey would have been proud at the preparation.  Bouncy, yet firm and covered with a pickled something or other and a house made sriracha rounded it out.  OMG, the sriracha was perfect and added a nice kick to the dish.  Sweetie is a virtual Sea Bass Connoisseur and said it was the best she's ever had.....a statement not to be taken lightly!  We shared a chocolate torte for dessert and called it a night. Global is priced well, had many good menu offerings and we will definitely be back.  Well done!!!",

My entree, sea bass was overcooked and tasted bland and not very fresh.  The only part of the meal that we liked was the dessert.  This was our first time here for my birthday and was very disappointed considering all the great reviews.  Was this any off night, maybe but will probably not go back. One positive was our waiter-very knowledgable and friendly.",

    "text": "Okay this was my second trip to Global --the first being 3 years ago and the last tonight. We were greeted by a uppity hostess ..who acted like we could not be seated or taken care of..I understand --we DID NOT have a reservation, but it was a Tuesday Night and it was 6 PM and No one was there....no one other than myself and the waiters. She did say she would try and I went to the restroom and came back out and she ..said..POSSIBLY we could sit at the bar...So we took it..a party of three...and we were happy to be there--it just sets the mood when the people that own the restaurant where YOU are going to spend YOUR MONEY and they act indifferent to you.. We started out with a bottle of BOOM BOOM Sirah..it was good. We ordered 3 appetizers...the Mediterranean Lamb, the Berkshire Pork Belly, and Butternut Squash  Soup.   Soup was good..Pork Belly can do no wrong..EVER and the Lamb...not quite good and way to tough and well done. We then ordered the Sea Bass and the Open Raviolio. The Open Raviolio had way to much canned tomatoes, zucchini and wet veggies...not really there. The Sea Bass looked beautiful..the top 1/2 inch was edible the rest..was a tough gelatinous piece of sea carcass. NOT able to cut or eat. They did take it off the menu.. The waiter ( Chris) was very good ...he was the bright light of the restaurant... The restaurant..was ALMOST GOOD..Not quite..not worth another trip back..Oh yea and it was very high priced for a Not Great place....",

Having worked at a large fish market throughout high school and college I have a pretty good idea of what is prepared correctly and what is not.  I ordered the seared sea bass, And have to say it was one of the best seafood dishes I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Highly recommend that and would definitely order again.  My wife had the sweet potato ravioli which was also good.  We both had the lobster bisque which although had a nice flavor  had not a morsel of lobster in there. Overall the meal was excellent and will def be back.",

    "text": "We thought we would try Global after all of the positive reviews. We had tickets to a show and thought this would add to it nicely and make it a great evening out. It is a small restaurant tucked away in an office complex. We had early reservations so that we could get uptown for our show and were the first diners. It felt a bit odd to be in the only ones in a small restaurant, a bit like goldfish in a bowl, but we were well attended by our server and soon there were others diners.   We started with the cheese platter, which was wonderful. Hard to mess up sliced cheese I suppose. For our main entrees, we ordered a tilefish special and the lamb. I love lamb and theirs is a duo of loin and belly, so I was quite excited to try it. I love pork belly, and am familiar with the cut, and the server explained that the belly was braised for over 24 hours. Yummy, right? I wish I had enjoyed it.. I can only describe my dinner as disappointing. They cover the meat with this gravy like sauce. Since we were the first in the restaurant, I can only assume that the chef was still prepping or had just finished prepping his kitchen for service because my sauce was refrigerator cold. I don't like to send things back, and didn't want my meat reheated past my requested medium rare temperature, so I scraped the sauce off the meat and ate my cooled loin and vegetables. I turned to the belly and realized they had given me the cap. I couldn't find a trace of meat in all of the solid fat. Again, I am familiar with belly. I understand it is a fatty cut, but this was white solid fat. I asked the server if the cut looked unusually fatty and he went to speak to the chef. The chef responded that the belly is basically like a solid piece of bacon, it is supposed to be fatty. If he were to slice me a new piece, it would look the same. Then the server adds.. \"it is edible\". Hmm. No thank you. If it had any meat, or if the fat were somewhat liquified or caramelized, it would have agreed with the \"edible\" comment, but this was disgusting. The chef doesn't even want to see the slices to gauge my complaint? I left the two slices on my plate, disappointed that I was still hungry. I ate a bit of my boyfriend's fish and wished I had ordered something, anything, else. I don't really like dessert, but I was hoping to fill my stomach a bit more. We both got dessert. I got this marscapone strawberry thing, which was really sweet.. but I was hungry. He got the trio of brulees, which he was happy with.   When we were presented with the bill, the server asked how everything was. I again expressed my disappointment. I had only eaten half my dinner. He again let me know what the chef had said. He returned with the credit card and let me know the manager had taken a dessert off the check. I was disappointed that at no point, after complaining twice about the quality of the cut, did I see the manager, or did the chef see my cut.   Thanks for the dessert, but way too little effort. A bad situation can e turned around by simply acknowledging a guest's complaint. Rather I felt condescended to regarding my knowledge of the belly cut and unimportant to the senior management to bother stopping to talk to me.   I really wanted to like this place, but there are other restaurants in Charlotte and we won't be back.  VISITED JUNE 8, 2013",

At that time there were only a few other diners, so it was quiet and we received plenty of attention and enjoyable conversation with the waiters.  The food we were served was quite good by any standards but especially by Charlotte's.  We had a cheese plate, cured beef, scallops,  mushroom ravioli, and finished with mouse.  The food was all very flavorful, well presented, fresh, some local, and creative.  The bar menu is also very good with a pretty good selection of wine by the bottle and glass, and there are a few unique beer options if that's your preference.  I had some of both.  The only thing lacking was our dessert course, which was a bit thick and rich for what we expected of a mouse.    The major downside to this restaurant is the location and the atmosphere.  It's located in an office park, which has a very deserted feeling in the evening. It's also buried pretty deeply as was evidenced by the abundance of signage directing you to the restaurant, and not that easy to find.  Inside the restaurant, it seemed to be trying so desperately to make you think you aren't in a space intended to be an office.  The industrial carpeting and drop ceiling were ever present.  The art, music, and other decorations make you feel like you are in the star trek cafeteria.  The food is great, but this place would be so much better in a more authentic location.",

The food is very creative - I believe the name comes from the fact the chef works in all kinds of cuisines, hence the greek appetizers, southern style pork, french-style roast chicken, etc. It is a little frenetic on the menu, but the kitchen is able to turn out lovely renditions of classic items. In particular the duck with french lentils and fig sauce is sublime.   Desserts are good, but nothing outstanding. I would go over to Salara and finish the evening there instead (or go across the street to Vintage!)",

As a disclaimer everyone should expect delays during restaurant week. A restaurant can go from 5 reservations on Tuesday to 30 during restaurant week. It is an adjustment. We were a party of 4. The bartender was good, be sure to ask for the liquid sunshine :). We met the owner and she was very pleasant. I enjoyed the saffron papperdelle pasta which was seasoned very well and the collard greens added extra texture.  We were able to sample each others food and the steak medallions were cooked properly but I wish there was more coffee crust on them. The carrot-ginger soup was not heavy on the ginger, which I liked. The macaroni and cheese could have used more cheese sauce, it was not as creamy as I would like. But it had a good flavor.

It was very well composed which is nice in a dish that can get by on it's decadence. The belly, itself, was perfectly prepared. Pickled vegetables added an excellent acidic and textural component. The spicy mustard topping added an interesting bite.  The Entree was a pork chop with root vegetables and herb potato gnocchi with a fig reduction sauce. The pork was well cooked and seasoned. The root vegetables were out of this world. They conveyed a sense of warmth (but not spicy) and home. The gnocchi was great with a little char that added flavor and texture but no bitterness.  The Smore dessert was rich and lovely. Capturing the childhood flavors and refining it to the adult pallette.   Definitely worth trying.",

I love the Shrimp \"Ooo La La!!!\" which is flash fried & tossed in a sweet & sour Papaya vinaigrette. And, we also love the Diver Scallops as well as the Sea Bass. Since we both love Creme Brulee, we usually go for the Trio of Creme Brulee  - delish!!   The restaurant is a little pricey but worth the splurge. Also, we have been when they have participated in Restaurant Week -- or  when they have offered fixed price specials.

We said something to the waiter and he basicly lifted his shoulders made a face and said he was sorry. We alluded to it again hoping he would offer another piece but he ignored us? For a special meal way over $25.00 save your money! Order something else or go someplace else! I went to culinary school and owned a catering business.

Fresh Bread/Cheese:  6/10  You might think this is weird to add this in the review but I thought it was pretty cool that they made fresh butter/cheese every night with their own twist.  It just so happen that cream cheese and dill was below average to my pallet.  Pork Tenderloin:  9/10  Succulent! Delicious tender pieces of pork laid over a risotto to die for... Worth a 2nd, 3rd, possibly 4th order in a row.    Additionally, they have a wide selection of local micro brews which always pushes you up on my list.  Great job, guys.  Only problem....

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited Global during Restaurant Week-and oh boy, were we delighted with the food and service!  Ah, how I love Restaurant Week-especially at a restaurant I've never tried before! Up front I was impressed with their offerings for the tailored menu, and we went HUNGRY.  I will tell you-they are all by themselves in the office park, tucked away in the back corner in their own little world. They have been in business for 7 years, so your GPS is probably right instead of wrong as it leads you away from civilization.  I ordered the: *Ooo La La Shrimp-Shrimp flash fried (no batter!) and tossed in a DELICIOUSly complex papaya vinaigrette and served with micro greens. The four shrimp were quite large, and had a very subtle heat I thought, with very Indian/Asian flavors. *Mouclade Fourasine Style-mussels, shrimp and clams served with a creamy curry fennel risotto and focaccia. I literally scraped my bowl clean with the bread and would have licked the plate if I thought I wouldn't be judged toooo harshly by diners close to me... SO TASTY! This was Indian meets Italian with this incredible dish. *Mascarpone Strawberry Verrine-so light and fresh, layers of mascarpone and strawberries topped with coconut crunchy    My boyfriend ordered the:  *Spring Mix Salad with pork belly-little pork belly explosions in the lettuces, carmelized pecans, manchego cheese and apple vinaigrette.  *Sea Bass-wilted greens, braised shallots, Sriracha, & cauliflower goat cheese sauce. The flavor factor was HUGE! The fish was cooked perfectly, so moist and flavorful, with a delicate flavor that married excellently with the cauliflower goat cheese sauce. I think he DID lick his plate. :-) French meets Asian, I wish I was having this for dinner tonight! *Nougat Glace-served frozen, roasted hazelnuts, pecans & maple creme Anglaise (I almost licked his plate). BEAUTIFUL presentation, with a foot-long puffed pastry that looked almost like a quill stuck in the frozen cream.  They served complimentary bread with a fennel butter-which amazingly paired well with everything we ate, including the wine. They had a special Restaurant Week Wine Menu, with three $30/bottle wines to choose from .We had the Malbec, which went well with everything we ate.  The chef, Bernard, came out to meet us after we were finished. His wife greeted us when we came in initially. They were SO FRIENDLY and hospitable, we will definitely go back and enjoy some more of their menu selections! Highly recommended-this restaurant truly has \"global\" flair, beautiful presentation, cozy atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Tucked away in a non-descript office complex, betwixt some unsightly concrete parking structures in a part of town long-abandoned after normal business hours, you will find Global Retaurant. So unlikely is this location, that I swore my GPS had to be wrong as I was pulling up for dinner with a large work group. If you happen to be fleeing the authorities and want to grab a solid meal in the Charlotte area, this would be a good choice. Indeed, it would likely be one of the last places they'd look for you.  Global delivers outstanding, complex cuisine. Its brand of New American borders features some French accents, including some contributions from the former colonies.   We were a large group and ordered off a set menu. - appetizer tower: a little bit of the highlights: spring rolls (nondescript), tartare (good if you're into that) and pork belly (which was the star) - endive salad - diver scallops: this was outstanding. A difficult protein to get right, this was seared to perfection and served with a risotto cake, mizuna and a glaze. Great balance of flavors. I didn't try the duck, but apparently that was the hit.  Service was really good. We were 20+ people, and they got all the coordination right. Staff was knowledgeable about all the dishes and were attentive at all the right times. I really like how they explain all the dishes at the time of service.  My only knock about this place is the ambience. While I've always believed it's all the about the food, this location would seem to push that saying to the stress limit. Mentally, I just can't associate fine dining with desolate office parks... It works for a corporate group, but probably less for a date.  If I lived around here, I'd go back with a significant other but make this strictly a weeknight spot.",

    "text": "I have dined with Chef Bernard over 10 times and it never fails to be like a new first time.  What makes it so special are several things:  1) the food is just fantastic, 2) the wait staff have been there for a long time and know the food and wine/cocktail offerings like a best friend, and 3) Chef comes out of the kitchen to visit the tables and see how you are enjoying everything - and actually deeply cares what you think.    I've taken friends and clients 4 times this spring and have had most of the appetizers and many of the main courses.  I personally enjoyed the Butternut Squash Ravioli with shrimp, the Veal Tenderloin, the Divers Scallops, and the Paella, and have had tastes of the Sea Bass, Duck, and the Mahi.  My favorite appetizers are the Shrimp Ooh La La and the Pork Belly (to die for!), and the She Crab Soup is a must (being from Charleston I did not believe it could be as good as it is...but it is).  Let the wait staff make wine recommendations.  You will not be disappointed.",

Everyone in our group loved their entrees including the special Mahi which came with an creamy artichoke and chorizo sauce. She crab soup was also excellent and the apple berry tart was my favorite dessert.  The entire menu is done with an excellent flair.   The wine list is especially interesting with some unusual choices and good value.    Our server was was attentive but allowed us a very comfortable, relaxed pace.",

Our waiter was friendly but the service was horrible.   We ordered our food and it literally took an hour and half for it to come and that wasn't even the main course, it was the soup and salad. There is no reason that should have taken that long. In addition the waiter never came over to apologize unless we called him over. The restaurant wasn't incredibly busy either.  When our entrees came they were cold, over cooked, and tasted bad. Unfortunately we won't be going back.",

When we arrived for our 5:00 (Sat) reservation and was escorted to our table it was right next to someone.  As there were several open tables we asked to be seated at another table.  The chairs are very small & uncomfortable.  (And we're thin people)  Then we realized that people were being brought upstairs.  I went up to check it out and that's the dining experience that we are used to at Global.  Not sure why we were seated downstairs but realized how much the ambiance affects the meal/dining experience. In the future I will call to make my reservations rather than on-line.",

One good entree, but the wahoo special was overly salty, the baby eggplant too tough to cut and the mini pumpkin had hard pieces of shell that fell into the soft filling. I told the server when she cleared the plate, but clearly she never told the chef or he would have come by. DISAPPOINTING AT BEST.  Service was absolutely horrible. There were only 6 tables occupied...and servers were non existent. Waited for wine, bread, the check. It was such a let down. We were so excited for the new concept...please go back to what worked.",

    "text": "One of the best restaurants in Charlotte and a True \"hidden gem.\"    Global is an ideal place for a special occasion, romantic night out, or a business dinner.  We were just there for our 10th anniversary and had a fabulous experience,  When we sat down we were given complimentary champagne to help us celebrate.  Every course was delicious.  We had a cheese plate and shrimp for appetizers.  Our main entrees were sea bass and lamb.  Both perfectly cooked and plated very nicely.  The desserts were excellent, too.  While the food is high-end, Global is very reasonably priced with no entree more than $30.  If you live in the Ballantyne area or are staying at one of the area hotels you need to put this great restaurant on your list of places to try.  By the way, it is really hidden.  It is behind the Earth Fare/Red Robin shopping plaza in the Torringdon Way business area just North of 485 off of Johnston.",

    "text": "Went here for a business dinner. Do not recommend. Food was okay but uninspired and unimpressive. Wine list is extremely limited and narrow is scope...they had one Pinot Noir.   The decor was equally uninspired, it felt somewhat run-down. Tinny piped music, worn tablecloths and chairs could all be overlooked if the food was better.   The chef spoke to our table, unfortunately. While clearly knowledgeable about his menu, he did not have a very good tableside manner, and the server was clearly uncomfortable when he spoke to our table.   On the positive side, the martini was very good, and service was excellent.  Overall mediocre in terms of food, wine, and atmosphere. Unless you are stranded in Ballantyne or a hotel within walking distance, there are far better places in Charlotte to experience this type of cuisine.",
