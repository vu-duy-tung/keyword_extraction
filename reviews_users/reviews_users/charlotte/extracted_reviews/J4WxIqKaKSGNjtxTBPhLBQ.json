First of all the music that played throughout dinner was horrible. Terrible karaoke versions of songs by bands like America, The Eagles, and Melanie. (Melanie? Really?)   The mussels were not good at all, too much everything piled on top except mussels. The pumpkin ravioli was greasy, the ahi tuna drowning in sauce.  In a restaurant that had 190 people capacity there were only 6 of us in there and service was slow.  Anyway, I don't think we'll be back. I like Bonefish but I guess I'll wait until I get back to Nashville to eat there again.  Well, the bread was good.",

    "text": "I am not a fan of chain restaurants.  As a matter of fact there are only 3 that I will \"choose\" to go to.  Bonefish has been one of those places for me.  Over the 10+ years that I have been going to Bonefish. I have come to rely on them to 'consistently' provide a great meal...until last night.  Service was slow, our waiter seemed a bit distracted, and the worst part...the food was just \"ok\".  Unfortunately, \"ok\"  isn't acceptable to me when I'm spending $100+ for a meal.    - They either changed their bread recipe or it was an off night.  Either way, the bread had no flavor whatsoever....we were thankful for the flavored dipping oil!  - Bang Bang Shrimp was barely battered, arrived to the table \"warm\", and the sauce was lacking.  -  Calamari was also \"warm\" when it arrived and was seriously under-seasoned. - My husband had his favorite, Fontina Chop.  We almost laughed out loud when the waiter put the plate down and saw the \"tiny\" bit of mashed potatoes and the (6) little cubes of zuchinni that were his sides with the pork.  The chop was tasty and the sauce was delicious as ever, but the chop was a tad overdone. - The soda fountain was off in it's mixture...again.  My son and husband had to send their drinks back for new ones.  The waiter said that he was going to get it from another spot in the restaurant since they sometimes have issues where he got it from originally.  So...if they know it's an issue shouldn't they get it fixed?  BTW...my son reminded us that the same thing happened last time...and he was right. - Kobe beef burger was slightly overdone and wasn't hot when it arrived, but the housemade chips were excellent.  My son ate every one of them and hated to share with the rest of us who wanted a taste.   - Fish & Chips were good, but a bit greasy...and they hadn't been that way in the past. - I had the Bonefish Salad and that was excellent and my guys had Caesar salads and they loved them. - Pomegranate Mango Sangria was delish!  Highlight of the meal....how sad is that?!?  So...it wasn't a terrible meal, but it wasn't what we have come to love about Bonefish.  I seriously hope it was just a bad night, but I am hesitant to go back again.  With so many good restaurant options, I don't know if I'm willing to take the chance on another \"ok\" meal.  It's a shame and I hate to give up on a place that I really love.",

Also some of the \"patrons\" seem a bit low class; better suited for a Denny's than a nice mid-range restaurant.  Not sure where they are coming in from since this is an upper middle class neighborhood.",

My sister and I decided to check this location out for lunch. It's located in Carmel Village on Pineville-Matthews Road. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. Food was amazing! We started with the Oysters Rockefeller's that was served on a bed of rock salt which I thought was pretty cool. Be careful as of some of the rock salt may get in your oysters...just in case you're watching out for your salt intake. I got a huge chunk of salt that slipped in the oyster. For my entree, I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos with a side of jasmine rice. We had to ask for the bread. I'm sure it had something to do to the fact that the bartender was serving us. Kudos to her for making an exceptional mix of drinks. I ordered the Pomegranate Martini which was served with red grapes on a small skewer. My sister ordered the Apple martini which was out of bounds delicious! I took a sip when she went to the restroom...guess she didn't notice a portion missing from her martini cup. Will definitely order my own at the next Bonefish I visit. Nothing spectacular about this location as it seemed to line up with the other chain restaurants. Food was great, service was great, and atmosphere was awesome.",

I ordered grouper with colossal shrimp and hubby had fish n fries. I'm noticing food coming out consistently to tables except ours...it took too long so of course I mention this to our server who says \" everything is being made fresh\", well I sure hope so! Our food comes out and so does the manager who comes over to ask if everything is ok. I mention the wait and he pretty much says the same thing (Listen, I expect my fish to be fresh, smh). That put a damper on the dinner and I was just ready to leave. Took my food home and put it in the fridge. The next morning, the smell was so fishy I couldn't stand it! I immediately through the food out! Scratching this place off of my list! If my fish wasn't blackened I may have known I was served fish that \"wasn't so fresh\".",

Without a reservation you could be looking at \"an hour and 15 minute wait\" no lie. People come and wait though. Order the \"bang bang shrimp\". Just do it. You will not be disappointed. Salads are tasty and well composed. Wait staff is attentive, if a bit stretched. Food comes promptly and is always good. This place is not inexpensive, but they have their act together, so it is worth it. If this is your first try, you night want to go on a weeknight so that you aren't distracted by the huge crowd. Also, ask for a booth when you place your reservation. They are much more comfortable, and you don't have to listen to the conversation at the neighboring table of \"expressive diners\".",

I do have one problem with them though, for some reason, probably because of my speed and precision in eating them, they disappeared way too fast, compelling me to order a second order of them.  YES, I know, that was greedy of me, but, If I don't treat me good sometimes, who will, LOL.  I must try the coconut shrimp next time.  I indulged in a Fontana pork chop, deeply covered in with Fontina cheese, garlic, prosciutto & mushroom marsala wine sauce, so says the menus, and it is delicious. While I tend to watch my pork intake, I can only say that I watched this as it disappeared from the plate and nearly licked the plate clean, it was some kinda good.

The bread and olive oil with herbs was good.  However, I like Basalmic Vinegar.  Nate brought me some! We had the Bang Bang Shrimp which was plenty for two dinners. He said the Shrimp was a 7oz. serving about 12 to 15 shrimp.  We also ordered the app of two crab cakes.  We didn't care for the dip because after having the Bang Bang Shrimp it was too spicy.  The crab cakes tasted fine with just a squeeze of lemon.  My husband really like them because the amount of breading was very light. We decided to order the Cobb Salad with grilled Tuna.  A mistake.  So we sent it back and had Salmon grilled.  The small part of the piece was over cooked.  However the larger part was fine and flaky.  All during this Nate had a smile on his face and understood what needed to be done. We took home a Strawberry Shortcake.  It was real Shortcake and real Whipped Cream. Heaven. He went the extra mile.  Thank you Nate for making our dinner great!",

The bartenders do a great job of remembering your name AND drink choice even if you have only been in a couple of times. Of my favorites, The steak is great here and always cooked just the way I ask. The fontina chop is wonderful and the gravy is rich .The fish and chips is another favorite with its light and crispy batter (the fries are pretty darn good too! ) Wednesday is bang bang shrimp night, a little to busy for my liking so come early!",

I don't know what was more insulting; the hotdog bun or the $18 + I paid. How dare you serve it on a soggy hot dog bun. Rude. The lobster part...flavorless and disappointing. The fries, salt-less, not as disappointing, however I probably had like a total of 11 fries. COME ON! 11 freaking fries.  The coleslaw was ok, it needed more or less of something but I can't quite put my finger on it. It was served with some bread and pesto(?) it was so warm and good.  All in all the decor was beautiful but I didn't go there to eat fancy chairs and flat screen tv's....  Service was good.",

It normally takes a lot to get us out for Sunday brunch because lines are long, and due to crowds food can be mediocre.  We make a mean breakfast meal so we usually opt to stay in and cook at home.  We decided to change it up this morning and bike to brunch.  To our surprise, no big lines and an overall enjoyable brunch.  My husband had the western omelette and I had the bang bang shrimp eggs Benedict.  We also had $5 mimosas.  They still have a full lunch menu for those who may want something different.

    "text": "What can I say this place will always be a favorite in my book.  Seafood done at its best.  Your experience here will wow you in every aspect from the food to the drinks and the service, its an all around amazing experience.  When you come make sure to have room for all three courses. While I agree with everyone yes the bang bang shrimp is a staple if not THE staple for Bonefish Grill please kindly open your options to some of the other amazing items on the menu because if you haven't branched out you're doing yourself a disservice.  For starters the tuna sashimi appetizer is THE BEST one I have ever had in charlotte and believe me if I go out to eat and its offered I'm eating it no exceptions.  Its always perfectly seared and served with wasabi ginger soy sriracha and a perfect white sashimi sauce. Also if youre a fan of mussels this is always a win here also.   Now on to the main course, they have an amazing selection of fish which is not limited to your average tilapia, salmon and trout. While they have these on the menu and they are some of the best sellers as they are delicious of course don't be afraid to go above and beyond with something like the seabass or the even branch out from the seafood category and try the fontina porkchop. Its to die for. This place perfected seafood but they also have landfood down pat too, from the fontina chop to the lilys chicken.  They also have specialty toppings that will take your entree to the next level like you wouldn't believe, now these aren't always on the menu so be sure to ask for them. For example try the Imperial style topping that usually comes on the tilapia on the seabass. Basically its a seabass stuffed with shrimp scallops crabmeat gruyere and parmesean cheese then topped with a lemon butter caper sauce.... uh yes please!!  OR if your wanting something lighter try any fish Rheas style, its best on seabass and salmon but honestly compliments fish or steak perfectly its sauteed spinach lump crab meat and a lime tomato garlic sauce.  These are only examples of SOME of the toppings they have,,,,, can you tell I eat here too much? Just ask they have so many options to customize your order and make a delicious meal, that much more outstanding.  Also don't forget to pair your meal with the perfect glass (or bottle) of wine or cocktail they have one of the best wine menus I have seen in a chain restaurant and its ever changing with so many options to choose from.  Also save room for dessert as they have THE BEST coconut pie you have ever tasted served with freshly made whip cream and rum sauce.  They also always have a seasonal dessert, my favs being the chocolate creme brulee and/or the pumpkin creme brulee they have in the fall and winter.  Service is always amazing from the servers and bartenders to the management. Every experience you have here is always special in some way even beyond the food. I can definitely see why there are so many regulars myself included.",

Once taken to the table it was very noticeable that the table cloth had been replaced by tacky plastic. We ordered the mahi mahi grilled, and two sides. The fish while a very small portion, was warm although a little dry. The sides were cold, and the Mac and cheese was fridge cold. The waitress was extremely nice removed the mac and cheese from the bill and apologized for the dry fish and cold sides.  Not really sure what happened, is this typical of the Pineville NC chain it is this a franchise wide issue? I travel a good bit and Bone Fish is my favorite for fresh and relatively health food. Looks like I will have to reconsider my go-to when on the road.",

The Caesar's salad was perfectly chilled with just just the perfect amount of dressing. The Chilean Sea Bass was outrageous and the Creme Brulee was plentiful and delicious.

Someone else picked Bonefish and I was happy to be able to get the bang bang shrimp.  Our entire party arrived early and was seated; I was five minutes behind but still 15 minutes early. Apparently, this meant I was to be ignored by the server and staff for the rest of the evening.  My drink order was taken late, my drink took longer, my dinner never arrived until I asked, at which point they made up an excuse about the scallops being cooked incorrectly. I opted to cancel my dinner order, but it still showed up 10 minutes later. They tried to offer me a free dessert but at this point I preferred my pot pie at home and ice cream.  Plus, I ordered another drink that took even longer to come. Server was... ineffective and confused.  Of course, they offered to comp my dinner but sure enough, it was on the bill. Tried to explain that to the server but he couldn't comprehend simple logic or math.  Won't be back.",

I received drink approximately 9 minutes after initial order, but didn't get water until I had asked a second time. Very disappointing in a brand that I probably won't be going back to any time soon.

You MUST start with the bang bang shrimp...they are the perfect mix of sweet and spicy! And the size of the order is great! So full of flavor and heat an absolute treat! All the previous reviews are correct...they are a must have if you visit this restaurant!  Also the Pomegranate martini is so yummy...sweet and refreshing topped with frozen grapes...it was just wonderful!   For our meals, my boyfriend chose the Shrimp and scallops and I decided on the crab cakes as a dinner...now you won't find this dinner on the menu but ask for it because they will create it just for you! It comes with two crab cakes and is paired with either a soup or salad.  The shrimp and scallops were delicious, cooked perfectly and paired with one or all of the side sauces they offer. We chose the pan Asian and lemon butter which are both heavenly! The pan asian is sweet and spicy and was great on the scallops and the lemon butter just really enhanced the taste of the shrimp. However, encourage you to try all the sauces!   The crab cakes are filled with so much crab it's absolutely wonderful! They come with a wonderful sauce that adds a bit of \"spicy\" to the cakes! The taste is just to delicious to fully describe...try them! You will not regret it! Yum!  Our server was wonderful! she made sure we had everything we needed, checked to make sure our food was ok and even brought out a dessert box with delicious chocolate with sprinkles and dried strawberries on top!  I absolutely loved the experience, the food and the service!   Everything about this restaurant was wonderful...they did an outstanding job!!!",

We had patronized this location once before and had a very pleasant dining experience, so we were really excited to visit here again.  We arrived there around 4:30 pm. and the restaurant was virtually empty with the exception of a couple sitting at the bar and 3 other families dining at the tables.  We were immediately seated by the hostess and given menus. This is where our service ended. We waited and waited and waited for someone to at least come and take our drink orders. No one ever came. We also noticed that a group of servers were standing in the back chatting and wrapping silverware, but still no one came to get our orders. It was as if we were invisible! We decided to leave. When we got to our car, we decided to call the restaurant and ask to speak to the manager.   The person who answered the phone ask for our name, and other grilling questions before placing us on hold. I personally don't think she ever got the manager because we were holding for about a couple of minutes before we decided to hang up.  Needless to say, won't be back here again! Service appears to be hit or miss.",

Took my friend for her 50th Birthday, so it was a special occasion. I mentioned that in the reservation, and they denoted that when seating us with a \"Happy Birthday!\" Very nice gesture.  Had to start with the Bang Bang Shrimp, which I call \"Shrimp Crack!\" This stuff IS addictive! Be forewarned....it's easy to eat the copious amounts they give you, and if you're not a big eater this dish alone can fill you up!  I also ordered the Corn Chowder with Lump Crab Meat. My GOD was this delicious! Best dish of the night for me. Very creamy, RICH and full of fresh crab and chunks of corn. Highly recommended!  We both got the \"Surf and Turn\" even though it is NOT explicitly on the menu. You have to order the steak of your choice (in our case Filet Mignon) and add a side of Surf (in our case Lobster tail). Not a hugh portion but still yummy for a giant sea cockroach! LOL....Steak was prepared the way I asked for it, and it was decent quality. Not the best Surf and Turf I've ever had but it was delicious nonetheless for a competitive price. Gotta love the butter dip they bring for the Lobster. I should have ordered 2 doses of Lipator with that!  They do have a nice wine list, and I ordered 2 glasses of Sparkling Wine to celebrate my friend's birthday.  The waitstaff is very nice, but our guy was a little inexperienced so I'll give him a \"mulligan\" for bringing our food to the next table, not bringing a cold bath for my wine, and being a little scatter brained. But he WAS very nice and tried hard.   All in all a VERY good dinner and she loved and appreciated this experience.  TIP: I brought my own bottle of Pouilly Fuisse for only a $10 corkage fee! This is VERY reasonable and a relatively inexpensive option for those of us who are real oenophiles!",

They sat us at a six person table in the bar area and said that due to the table location we could not use a sling. If we wanted another table, we would have to wait even longer so we stuck with it. We had to awkwardly place the car seat behind our chairs and hope people walking by didn't trip over him.     Our server was also one of the bartenders, so we were highly neglected.  Drinks went long stretches of time without being refilled and it took forever before we were able to order.    Once we got our food it was really good.  The bang bang shrimp appetizer was delicious. Lots of flavor but not too spicy. I had the fish and chips for my main dish which was amazing.  Given that the food was good, I will likely give this place another chance in the future.",

When we got there, we were greeted and seated right away.  They wait staff were very warm and welcoming. They were very patient with the kids and our large group.  We did not feel rushed to place our order. They were very knowledgeable about how food is prepared. (i'm gluten-free, dairy-free.)  Although food was taking awhile to come out, we were understanding cause the restaurant was crowded due to the holiday. The wait staff was great at checking on is to bring us more bread (which my family loved) and refill our drinks.  I ordered Chilean sea bass, and it was moist and delicious.  The asparagus was crisp and tasty too.  I don't remember what everyone else ordered, but I do remember that everyone loved what they got.  Then when the waiters heard that 2 of the kids were celebrating their birthdays, they brought out treats with a candle for each birthday kid.  Very sweet.  Overall, it was a great experience.... great service, great food, good time with family,",

We went on a Friday night, they were about 85% busy, and we were seated right away.  The restaurant serves bread with oil while you're looking over the menu.  The menu is primarily seafood of course, but there are a few other options for the folks who don't do seafood.  We ordered the watermelon martini, bang bang shrimp, house salad, shrimp & scallop combo and lastly my fiance ordered the waygu beef burger.  The bang bang shrimp are the highlight of the meal.  The watermelon martini was ok, it was not very strong and honestly I wouldn't order it again.  Kinda chunky as it was muddled.  My shrimp and scallops were ok, kind of dry.  My fiance's burger was ordered medium and served well done.  He said he's had better burgers at cookout.  The server and manager addressed the problem and had a new burger made.    We liked how they were nice about the situation and fixed the problem.  A new burger was served and it was so much better.  Also it was comped.    Bonefish was ok. The staff is friendly. The ambiance is nice.  The food is a little below par.  For the prices I had higher expectations.",

I wouldn't get spinach again as much as I love spinach. It was under-seasoned. It was my second attempt with it so I know now it's not for me...even after adding table-side seasonings!

First we arrived to find a sniffling host checking out a \"pick up\" order.  He was rubbing his nose more than he was talking. I was actually grossed out. He took more than 5 min to acknowledge us -- actually he never acknowledge us -- a waiter walked up and acknowledged us while he handled all the food of the \"to go\" order.... sniffles and all.  We were seated and were well taken care of.... but here is where things also change. First we were well handled except our orders (once we got the bill) were not exactly how we ordered. The Bang, Bang Shrimp was almost all lettuce --we with about 8 shrimp on top. $10.90 I expect some shrimp not lettuce. I ordered the 6oz filet Nancy ordered the Shrimp and Scallops with lemon butter. I substituted a salad for one of my sides $2 extra (and I was told not to order the dressing I preferred) but to order the house made citrus dressing the server preferred.  Nancy ordered a side of asparagus we were warned of an up charge .... not a $4 up charge we expected $2. -- our mistake. My steak arrived perfect Nancy loved her dinner. We had a $20 discount so we were surprised by the $61 bill (including 2 draft beers) after discount.  Our bill for this dinner would have been $81+ I did find (after getting home) that I was charged for the \"large\" steak when I ordered the small. The table adjacent to ours had some kind of soup .... the server told her that he didn't know what \"She Crab Soup was\". -- the Manager also told her that he didn't know either.....come on folks ... I don't eat seafood but I know what \"She Crab\" soup is...... this was just not right all the way around. They get three stars for the taste of the food and our server was kind (thus my not complaining) but I'm still taken aback by the bill and how wrong it was. It is too expensive for what you get with out justifying the quality. Runny nose and all.",

The table was not set up yet on time, and we had a select menu to choose from (but they gave us their regular menus). They seemed a little underprepared. But after that everything seemed to go a little smoother. Our servers (we had two) were good and seemed to check on us frequently.  Our select menu was a three course meal that included a salad (house or Caesar), an entree, and a dessert. I opted for the Caesar and it was delicious, not overly dressed.  I got a alcoholic beverage - pomegranate martini. It was fruity, but sweet. I drank three of them!  For the entree I ordered a filet mignon (medium rare) with the whipped potatoes and broccoli.  It seemed to take quite a long time for the food to come out. When it did, my steak was over cooked (it was basically well done) and the broccoli was under-seasoned - or maybe not seasoned at all?   A little after the entrees came out there was a little situation and the medics were called. Everything is fine. But the staff (management) was helpful and responded quickly. This was why I gave them the four stars. After everything they checked up on me and seemed honestly concerned. After the situation, I was able to take my dessert home - brownie with ice cream.   Their food was not bad, it was just a little under-seasoned (but pepper does the trick!) and my steak was a little over done - but I'm sure they would recook it if I had asked. I have been here several times, and I'm sure I'll make my way back here again!",

    "text": "Finally, restaurant staff that works together and a manager that knows how to right a wrong. We're long time fans of the brand, but this was our first time at this location. It was a very busy night, as they had a Father's Day promotion going on. There was a large party in my waiter station, and they seem to be very high maintenance. We sat for what was starting to feel like longer then we should, when another waitress came over, apologized that her colleague was delayed, and offered to take our drink and appetizer order. She brought us water and bread. She proceeded to keep her eye on our table throughout the night, and pitched in whenever necessary. Our waiter seemed rather inexperienced, and it seemed a large party was really throwing him for a loop. He was very rattled when he waited on us, and then screwed up the order. When we told the food runner that what he brought was in order, the manager was at our table with in seconds. She was very apologetic, made no excuses and took full responsibility for the error. Very professional! Katie Fuller, you should give lessons to other restaurant managers in the Charlotte area!!  They got the corrected order out to our table reasonably quick. Katie and our waiter checked back often to ensure everything was OK, and they graciously comp'ed the meal.  Both my husband and I have worked in the restaurant industry, and we know crap happens. It's how you handle the crap that makes the real difference. Katie and the staff turned what would've been a miserable dining experience into a very refreshing example of what good service should look like. We will be back. Bang-Bang!",

    "text": "Stopped in after work on a Wednesday for the Bang Bang shrimp special; it's a small portion. Full disclosure: their HH specials are for the bar customers only but since they were slow (maybe 5 tables occupied in the entire place) we were allowed to sit in a booth in the bar area. Bartender went above and beyond (1.5 stars).  Then it went downhill.  I ordered the mussels (HH special) and fish & chips. Mussels come in a thick sweet sauce which ruined it. As it got cold the sauce only worsened. Fish had a good crispy batter but the taste lacked flavor beyond batter. Now the fries were crispy and good (1/2 star). My friend ordered the ribeye steak - I just cannot give a review on steak at a fish restaurant! Disclosure 2: this was second time at this location; first time was with a business associate.  Both times at this restaurant I've experienced and witnessed the worst service. If this location is new they need to take time a fully train their servers; it's important to be attentive but SLOW down! I've seen servers run into each other, orders dropped food and drinks (one right behind me and a customer got soaked, leaving me concerned for my jacket on the back of the chair). The most recent visit, after receiving our food (our table was full) we had 4 servers try to deliver other patron's food - it's also annoying that we were talking each time to be interrupted.  Now I know this is not a favorable review but I did talk to the manager (Paul) about the distasteful food and poor service, even went so far to tell him that I would write this review. And after all of it he actually asked if I'd come back again... uh no! and there's no free meal worth it either.  I've had Bonefish in other cities and no the quality and food is good but this location is not.",

He suggested the winter white cosmo which was definetly as good as the watermelon cosmo.How can i forget the bread with olive pesto mix they bring out with every meal omg to die for if eating bread was a sin iv'e commited a tons because i that bread is to die for .I took my boyfriend here over the summer for fathers day and may i add the Surf and Turf they only offer on holidays is bomb!!!!

Our son ordered a hamburger medium that was totally rare, cold on the inside and also rubbery. So was the chicken on the salad. The quality of the meat and seafood was an F for sure.

For my entree I ordered the two cold water lobster tails. The tails were tender and sweet. I normally don't associate sweet with lobster. I also had a side of Jasmine rice and sauteed spinach. The sides were good as well. For dessert I had a slice of coconut cream pie with a rum sauce. It was easily the best meal I've had in a long time.",

    "text": "I had confirmed a large reservation on November 6th for a party of up to 25 guests. I called the end of November to give them a final count of 20 which actually ended up to be 16 guests that night. The dinner was on December 16th. This was organized to celebrate my graduation from UNC Charlotte and a chance for my family to meet my boyfriend of three years' family. Myself and mostly my family arrived at 5:45 and the table was not ready, that was fine since we were early. After discussing with the managing partner he explained if it is less than 20 guests we would be able to sit at one large table. So, I was expecting to sit at one large table but to my surprise we were seated at TWO separate tables which singled the families out... This was quite upsetting to me because my family could not mingle with my boyfriends family (whom were meeting for the first time). As we sat down we were given regular menus instead of the set menu I had organized. The menu was not already printed and we had to wait for them to be printed. When it finally was printed, it did not look like the menu from the PDF file I was expecting. We also had to use the regular menu for the side dishes, which should have been printed on the set menu as well. My guests were also not informed there was a salad and dessert included by either of the two servers. The two servers we had were not on the same page and seemed unaware of my party even coming in that night. Everything took forever to get to our table. Appetizers were ordered al a cart; as discussed, and took 30 minutes to get to the table. Entrees took over an hour to reach the table. I would have been fine with some of the guests receiving their meal sooner than others due to timing but that did not happen. At the table I was sitting at three meals were medium rare filet mignon and they were ALL cooked well done and dry. A1 sauce was never delivered to our table after asking, but the other table received theirs. The noodles at my table came out ice cold and after reheating the meal, the guest said it really wasn't that great anyways. At the other table my sister order the same; a medium rare filet mignon, and that also came out well done. My brother ordered the spicy tuna bowl and said the tuna tasted bad and didn't get to eat dinner. The managers on duty that night did compensate for only three of the meals, which was the right thing to do. Half of my guests left early because they were not informed dessert was included, and I wasn't there to inform them... After handing one waitress some money to cover the check, we never received an actual check until I asked for the itemized receipt (which a manager handed to me later). A few of the guests that stayed, wanted dessert but asked for it to go (after my side note situation) and that even took 20 minutes to come out. I am extremely upset and disappointed at how the night went, because I felt forgotten about; even when I made these plans a month prior.. The entire time being there was THREE hours.   On a side note, my sister fell unconscious about 5 - 10 minutes after the entree came out. We had to call 911 to come and check on her, she is doing fine; but it was quite scary. The management handled the situation very well and seemed honestly concerned about her. This part of the night was the only good thing that occurred.",

I loved the food so much that I ate there once more before heading home.  Eating at this chain was long overdue. In Charlotte, I told my friend that I'd like to go to a Bonefish Grill. She was good.  I booked a reservation online for 7:15 pm. The process was easy and straightforward.  We got there a few minutes after said time. We were promptly greeted by a polite woman who seated us in a booth.  I got the following items:  - Diet Coke with free refills - Complimentary bread with delicious garlicky oil dip - Crab cakes - Blackened fish tacos with greens - Chocolate lava cake with strawberries and whipped cream on the side  My friend and I shared everything, except for my Diet Coke and blackened fish tacos with the side greens. The funny thing is that I don't recall what she ate for dinner.  The crab cakes were amazing. There are lumps of crab meat delicately seasoned and made to perfection. The remoulade was so good that we asked for more.  The blackened fish tacos hit the spot. Grill the fish and place the portions in soft tacos, without dunking them in batter and making me figure out where the fish is. The dressing with the green salad was yummy, too.  The chocolate lava cake was incredible! So good. It was one of the best lava cakes that I have had in years. The strawberries were fresh and naturally sweet. My friend ate all the whipped cream. She was good to remember that I don't eat it.  Our server was personable and helpful. He promptly got me drink refills, which was nice.  Meals can get pricey. However, I have yet to have a bad meal here. I don't mind paying a bit more for decent food. Until we meet again, Bonefish Grill!  (121)",

    "text": "We were so excited to see that Bonefish Grill offers a Sunday brunch, and the hubby wanted creme brulee instead of cake for his birthday, so we picked Bonefish for our celebration.  The dining room was practically empty when we got there around 11am, so we had our choice of seating.  Our server was really nice and attentive (It has been my experience that the servers at Bonefish are exceptional.  I'm not sure how they consistently hire friendly people, but it's one of the reasons that I love this chain restaurant!). Our food was delicious.... but here is why I am giving them four stars out of five:  The hubby initially planned to order the Seafood Johnny Cakes and Eggs, but they apparently ran out of the menu item.  He was disappointed (it was his birthday!) but he also had his eye on Cod Fish and Chips, so it wasn't an entire bust.  I ordered the George Banks Scallops and Shrimp, with salad a side of bacon since it's brunch and you know... it's BACON, so YUM!  We enjoyed our meals very much and then it came time for dessert.  And guess which dessert item they were also out of?  If you guessed creme brulee, you would be right. And for that, they almost got 3 stars but I felt that the exceptional, consistent service didn't warrant a lower rating.",

Tried the lobster fritters which were a special and pretty good. Bang bang shrimp was good too, huge portion but I thought they were a bit generous with the mayo! I got the crab crusted cod. I thought it was a bit bland, dry and I couldn't taste the sauce at all! The few lumps of crab on it tasted medicinal :S Hubby got the pecan crusted trout which was so so over cooked it wasn't even funny! Seemed like someone had put it on a pan and forgotten about it! Mum got the sea bass with lime tomato sauce that was pretty good. I had wanted to try the butterfish special but they were out. Not sure if that was a blessing in disguise because I would have been crushed if they ruined another delicious fish by over cooking it!  We did let our server know about the trout and the manager came over, apologized and didn't charge us for it. We would have been happy to pay for a perfectly cooked fish but alas. I don't think I'll be back to this place",

    "text": "Bonefish has always been a huge favorite of mine. It's absolutely my go to spot on Wednesdays. While traveling for work, it's always nice to stick with reliable chain restaurants when searching may be difficult. This location is like other BF locations. Nice bar area with free seating and tables on the opposite side.  Food quality is always top notch here. Everything is consistent with other locations. I have recently started ordering the Salmon superfood salad and it is absolutely splendid. To save on calories, I opted for the dressing in the side.  Service at the bar was friendly and great.   Will return next time I'm in the area!",

I had the 6 oz filet and if my phone battery wouldnt have been on low, I would have taken a pic.  It was about 3/4\" thick (avg filet is usually 1-2\" thick), and so dry.  It was cooked properly at medium but man, that thing needed some juice.  It was flat and dry.  It arrived w about 1/3C (5 TBL) au gratin potatoes which were good AND about 6 asparagus.  This had to be the worst steak Ive had at a nice restaurant in ages.  The bread: very ho hum, not crusty or anything interesting.  Not worth the calories.

The facilities still look great but the food quality has definitely gone down. Used to be that I could expect an excellent meal at bonefish as well as excellent knowledgeable service. Now, the waitstaff is is about as knowledgeable as they might be at Applebee's. The seafood which used to be excellent is now what you expect to get at red lobster (not a compliment bu the way). But of course pricing remains high. Sides are also uninspiring with old tasting mashed potatoes. At the end of our experience I spent over $50 and had severe buyers remorse. There are much better options out there. I definitely won't be returning.",

    "text": "Bonefish Grill on Carmel for early dinner. I was delighted by the greeting from every employee! Our server was quick to the table & knowledgable ... enough so to clearly detail the specials, answer questions and make recommendations based on something specific to the dish. She also brought bread w.a good sized platter of seasoned olive oil. Not those skimpy ones other places give & I always have to ask for more....like 3 more! Unfortunately I forget her name & she was excellent! :-/  Oh! And the servers wore chef's coats! Nice touch!  Wednesday special: Bang Bang shrimp appie for $6. I ordered them GF/grilled, no breading. Just not the same as fried but ok. I didn't order a salad bc the shrimp come on a nice bed of greens. The salads I did see coming out were  generously portioned! Being rather hungry (aka eyes too big for my stomach ) I added al a carte sides of potato au gratin & sauteed spinach ($3 each). The potatoes were chunked like potato salad, not the usual sliced, and had lots of gooey cheese. Very good! The spinach was delicious; not oily & had just the right amount of garlic. One of my pet peeves is when you don't taste the food bc it is overseasoned. Like, what are they covering up when places do that?!  Excellent service, good food & nice atmosphere for just $12.00 Sometimes it's not worth shopping & cooking. An enjoyable visit! There were drink specials, also. But, it was my \"off night\".",

    "text": "I have visited this Bonefish Grill 3 times in the last 2 months.   On 2 of the visits I have had the same waiter (Jonathan).  He is friendly enough but not attentive. On the first visit there were 4 ladies total.  We had to ask for bread.  One of the lady's was on her way - so we asked that he have her drink ready when she got there - which he didn't.  He ended up bringing us 3 different bills when the first one was correct.  The last one he had added someone else's ($5) to my bill.   I told him it was wrong and he took out a five dollar bill from his pocket and told me to take it!! I told him I wasn't going to take his money and he insisted and gave me the money.  After everyone had a fiasco with their bills, we asked for the manager.  Jonathan kept saying he was waiting on his Manager to adjust the bill due to a 10% off coupon which is why we continued getting incorrect bills.  We told the Manager what was going on and she said this was the first she had heard about this. It was truly a comedy of errors - we were saying no one would believe what we had endured that night.  She handled it well and got the bills corrected and gave each of us a $25 gift card for all the trouble.    The next visit was about 2 weeks later and I got sat in Jonathan's section again.  Everything went fine until dessert.  There were 3 of us and 1 lady wanted to eat her dessert there and two of us wanted ours to go.  The to go orders were for pie and the lady that ate hers there got a brownie.  When he brought the to go dessert - it was brownies.  We told him we had ordered pie.  He truly looked at us like we had three heads.  One of the ladies had to remind him of the conversation about the pie.  Then he said that the brownies were for the next table.    The last time I ate there last week, I had a different waiter who was very nice and on the ball.  We had no issues.    I enjoy the food at Bonefish Grill but honestly if I would have gotten in Jonathan's section again - I think I would have left.",

That's because I have been spoiled by high quality steak houses. So when I go other places, I usually don't order steak, because I am normally disappointed. But Bonefish does a good job and represents their price point pretty well, I think. So I don't find ordering a filet mignon from them. Now, their ribeye seems to often have an excessive amount of fat on it. More than it should, but the flavor is good. You just feel like you didn't get the meat you should have.  I did order mine Oscar style, and the crab meat they topped it with tasted good, but they were tiny chocolate chip sized bites of crab. A little disappointing. The sauce added good flavor tho. It's a decent spot. What you would expect from this chain. So in that respect, they are spot on.",

The service was friendly, the food came out quickly, and tasted just as good as you'd expect at a place like this.   My only issues were with the crab toppings. If a restaurant offers crab topped anything, I expect it to be more than two pinch full of pieces. Is this what people who love Chipotle gripe about with their meats? Perhaps. I ordered some crab fried rice. All of the crab was just tossed on top of the dish, not mixed in. Certainly, that's not a huge deal- it's not troublesome to just mix it all in, but I wonder why it couldn't be done that way before getting to the table? My friend's crab topped fish had about 5 pieces for a whole filet.   Maybe the prices of crab went up lately? I admit, I haven't been watching the news very much lately. To save my sanity from the grievances of the new President and his Twitter fingers- maybe I missed out on what's happening in the seafood world.   That aside, the crumbs on the seat had to be dusted off as I sat down, one plate and two forks were dirty with visible food pieces. That's a bit much for a newly opened restaurant. We walked through the doors at 4:00pm. I told my stomach that it'll be a while before it tasted any bang bang shrimp again.",

Place is easy to find at the corner of Carmel and Pineville Matthews Road.  Decor is very pleasant - nothing that stands out as either exceptionally nice or exceptionally horrid.  Food was consistently edible.  Server asks if you want anchovy on the caesar salad which is a nice touch (dad said yes, I declined).  Salad was served a touch too cold for me.  The fish and chips was an acceptable option for us landlubbers.  Enough tempura batter and tartar sauce and I forgot I was eating fish!  Dad's dish seemed to be the best - the diablo shrimp over spinach fettucine.  I would have liked to tried a grilled fresh fish dish (the house specialty) - but they were priced in the $20 per entree range.  Seemed like a lot to pay if you aren't already a stark raving mad seafood devotee.  Which brings us to value.  I thought it was a okay for what we had - $81 before tip for dinner for three including two salads, three glasses of wine and one gin martini.  (BTW, the server seemed surprised that martinis are ordered with anything other than vodka.  Isn't gin the classic martini?)    No dessert - homemade chocolate on chocolate birthday cake was waiting at home!",

Brittany my server she was pleasant and attentive to customer needs.  2.  The ambiance is the standard for the chain.  Cons:1.  location.  2.  When I redeemed my born day reward I was surprised about the portions.  The additional food, Creme Brulee French toast I ordered was okay.  I guess after eating the same dish in the NOLA then this was a disappointment.  Mind you last year this time I was in another state and the portions were great.  Next year I will not go to this location and I know I will not be returning to this location.  I had to give it a try and well now you have it, my review that is.",

With a reservation, we still waited over 45 minutes for a table. Not even an apology was offered. After being seated, our server did not greet us promptly. There was no silverware given to us (or even offered), nor any appetizer or bread plates offered. After we asked for these, we were told \"there aren't any clean plates\" and \"we are out of silverware\". Eventually our server, Sheretta H, brought us two rolls of silverware and said \"these are the last two rolls\"- leaving the other couple at our table without any silverware. The pace of receiving bread was unacceptable ,but we had no plates nor any silverware to enjoy the bread anyway after it finally arrived. By the time we did receive silverware and plates, the bread was cold, and salads were getting stale sitting in front of us. Of course, no apology was offered for this. My wife promptly ordered a glass of wine when we sat down, and it actually arrived one our later. No apology, no acknowledgement by the server or mention of why that would happen. The pace we received the check was unacceptable, the pace we received our copy back to sign was completely unacceptable. No apologies offered. One of the entrees received was incorrect. Our server was quite truly the worst I believe I have ever experienced during a dining experience. We were beyond disappointed. Be prepared if you do decide to visit, and make sure you request a server other than Sheretta H.",

    "text": "Summary: great food, good service, snug but eloquent atmosphere.  First, is the food - to start,  I ordered a Caesar salad.  It was excellent.  The dressing was perfect and the croutons were yummy.  There was seriously nothing left on my plate.  For my entree, I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos.  This dinner item is under $10 and is definitely Bang Bang for your buck.  You also get to choose from a few sides.  I opted for the homemade chips.  They were very tasty but they didn't come with a dipping sauce so we requested a side of ranch.  Just the salad and the tacos filled me up - but of course, we munched on some amazing bread with a side of even better pesto & olive oil.  The waiter was patient (we had a group of 6) and knowledgeable about the menu and specials.  My only complaint was the timing between the salads/apps and our entrees.  My guess is close to a 25-30 minute wait.  About 20 minutes in, the waiter did come over and apologize and said that the kitchen got backed up.    We did have one birthday girl and she was given a small box of chocolate cookies to take with her.  It was a nice treat!  I'd definitely go back to Bonefish Grill and would recommend this restaurant to others who may not have tried it yet.  The locations can be somewhat inconvenient if you are in central Charlotte but I think it's worth a trip.",

My wife had the grilled trout and I had the Sir Will Fish and Chips; both were of an excellent quality and served in an attractive manner. The chocolate creme brulee for dessert was to die-for. Bonefish also has an extensive Martini menu. I had the raspberry martini which was both light and flavorful.  Our seater, server, and manager were all highly professional, courteous, and friendly, and genuinely made us feel that they were happy we were there. I am definitely recommending Bonefish Grill to my company as a venue for entertaining our visiting RVP's and clients. Thank you Bonefish for being a fantastic restaurant!",

    "text": "I've been to Bonefish Grill in Orlando (and had exceptional experiences) but hadn't tried either one yet in Charlotte.  We weren't disappointed.  I booked a reservation for a Saturday evening and, for being crowded, we were seated pretty quickly upon arrival.    The service was fantastic.  Our server was quick, attentive, and very knowledgeable.   Our food came one item after the other with little to no waiting.  To start, the complimentary bread with olive oil/pesto sauce was delicious.  Then came the superbly prepared calamari appetizer.  It was truly one of the best calamari dishes I've ever eaten.  It was very full of flavor with just a touch of spiciness.  Order extra dipping sauce, though!  It's so flavorful that you're going to want more for the big pile of calamari they serve!  Next came our unnecessary house salads.  I say unnecessary because with so much other food, we could have skipped the salad, but it was refreshing after the fried calamari.  Plus, it was more than just lettuce greens.  It contained some pricey items like kalamata olives, hearts of palm, and pine nuts so you definitely got your money's worth for only $2.80 to add to an entree.    Lastly was the entree.  I ordered the tuna steak -- rare -- with a chimichurri sauce (you can pick one of four sauces/flavors for your grilled fish).  It was so full of flavor.  We had made good choices all around.  Even the wine went down easy (although when doesn't it?).  Speaking of wine...they have a great, very reasonably priced wine list.  All in all, it was a great night out.  Bonefish offers a \"special night out\" feel, but not at the prices that you'd find at other seafood restaurants.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because Bonefish is a chain it's not good or not someplace to take a date or family visiting from out-of-town. It's truly worth it...and very affordable.  Although the atmosphere and decor wasn't as \"modern\" as the Bonefish I had been to in Orlando, it was still steps above other seafood chains like Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack.  And for the amount of food and its taste, as well as the exceptional service, you'll feel like you got a bargain!  In today's economy, that's a good thing!",

I've had a much better version of this at another chain restaurant.  I ordered the Talapia Imperial with garlic whipped potatoes and french green beans.

I found that to be very rude and for that reason I will not be visit this location anymore. Im a big bonefish fan and I alway recommend this place, i will recommend other locations except this one.",

    "text": "I'm updating this review because I ate here again and wanted to comment. It was my birthday and I made reservations for 7:15. Got there a little early they didn't even ask if I had reservations.  My husband asked the hostess if they did anything for birthdays. She told him to tell the server that they didn't have anything set up but she would do something special. That was not the case at all. I ordered the ribeye & lobster sauce with potatoes. My husband got a different kind of stake. When our meals came my steak was full of fat. But our server didn't come to check on us until my husband was finished with his meal. I was never offered a drink refill either. I asked for the manager, who said he was sorry and they would comp my meal. It did appear that my husband may have gotten the ribeye. He said his was great. I was so disappointed with the whole experience. This makes the second time that I ordered the ribeye that came loaded with fat. Needless to say I won't be wasting my money on their steak again. After contacting the management online they sent me gift cards. I haven't been back. Now I'm trying to find a friend to give them to. It will be a long time if ever that I go back.",

    "text": "From the very beginning we had issues. I called to place a reservation and was told at 3pm that there was about an hour wait. When I got to the restaurant and told them my name I was told I didn't have a reservation and could put my name on the list and wait another hour. The hostess had this tone as if it was our issue. I told them that was acceptable. They scrambled to put together tables (which included folding chairs)that could not accommodate our large party. We told them that would not work. So after another 30-40 minutes they managed to move tables around to seat us. Needless to say it took over an hour for our food to come out and almost everyone's food was cold. The waiter was very nice but was hard to find when you needed something. This was my first time here and last. You would think the manager would come over and apologize for everything that happened but she didn't. We didn't finish dinner until 6:45 when our checks were given to us. The majority of our time was spent waiting.",
