Brisket is great, collards are perfect, and mac n cheese is ridiculous. Management also gave us a piece of the pecan cobbler on the house. I'd never tried it before but I'm so glad they laid it on the table. My wife and I destroyed it. Thank you!",

Stuffed bacon wrapped jalapenos - 2 out of 3 not stuffed.  Told by server that side salad could be substituted for a side.  Was unexpectedly up charged.  Also side salad had corn and black beans tossed into salad, no option to remove because of staff tossing salad for you..  top it off with having told the server that I didn't care for the salad and receiving an \"oh\".  Later questioned up charge and received a \"would you like a refill to go?\"  It was as if I hadn't said anything.  Only refill given was the one to go...   at central location managers come by to ask how your meal was, the two men who appeared to be managers stood over by bar talking.  May have ruined my support for Millwood in future...",

Our waitress was helpful to explain the different BBQ sauces. My wife had a salad, and macaroni and cheese (and shared some of my sides). There was also a good selection of draft beer. There was an issue with the taste of her salad, and our waitress changed it out to a regular salad. The manager came over twice to ask if we needed anything, and he wanted to make sure we were okay. Great service; makes you feel taken cared of! We enjoyed our visit, and will return.",

    "text": "I know they JUST opened like yesterday, and I know they just literally got their liquor license today before they opened, but this was a meh experience. I ordered a Moscow Mule and there's no way there was any alcohol in it. I watched the bartender search for a pour spout, not find one, leave the unopened bottle at the end of the bar, pull down two more brand new unopened bottles of vodka and just leave them. I didn't watch the actual preparation of my drink but I definitely didn't taste the alcohol and all three bottles of vodka remained unopened, without pour spouts, and were clearly full bottles. I was also half way done with my entree before the second half of my companion's meal appeared. Guess the kitchen forgot? Pros though are that it's spacious and has a good layout, my food and half of my companion's appeared quickly, food was good, and their SC mustard sauce is pretty good, coming from a SC girl. I realize new openings and probably new staff come with hiccups, and this is right by me so of course I'll be back, next time I'll say something about my $9 cocktail though.",

I am no stranger to this restaurant usually eating at the Plaza Midwood location. I usually get a BBQ plate but opted for a sandwich and fries this time. First of all, this particular location is way nicer than the PM location but each fit the area and clientele they cater to. They weren't very crowded so we were seated right away. Service was excellent but the best part was the BBQ sandwich. Mouth watering delicious!! My only little issue is with the fries. I love the mini crinkle-cut fries but they don't brown them enough. They were limp. I noticed the PM location was the same with their fries too. This wasn't always the case. Back when they first opened, the fries were cooked to perfection. Then suddenly, they decided that crispy fries weren't as important. This won't keep me from returning but I will opt for a different side now instead of the limp fries.",

    "text": "Midwood Smokehouse is one of the newest additions to the Backlot of the Park Road Shopping Center and that is a yippee for me, as I live in the area.  Having been to other Midwood locations I was definitely looking forward to checking out their newest spot.  The weather was nice so we opted for waiting for a table on the outside patio, which was less than 10 minutes.  While we waited we ordered some drinks at the bar, and eyed every dish that went by, as well as smelled the amazing goodness. After arriving to our table we were greeted by our waitress who was great! She had a smile on her face and definitely gave us and every table around us the attention customers deserve. We decided to order a Combination Platter, which comes with 4 meats and two sides, and added a few additional sides. From the platter selections we chose the Chopped Pork, Brisket, St. Louis Style Pork Ribs and the Hickory Smoked Sausage with Macaroni & Cheese, Smoked Veggies, Crinkle Fries and an extra side of Hushpuppies. The food arrived and boy did it look good. By far the chopped pork and brisket were the winners, with the hushpuppies and fries shining for the sides.   Dinner did not disappoint and overall I think Midwood will be a definite hit in this location. With the service, atmosphere and food as good as it is anyone should check it.  And, go hungry, it's a lot of food!",

    "text": "Finally a BBQ restaurant so good that it deserves five stars. Of course it has to be in Charlotte NC.  I say that because right now I live in Salt Lake City and they struggle when it comes to good BBQ.  Those in Salt Lake City trying to build a restaurant and try to sell BBQ need to get out and go to the BBQ regions this country has to offer before attempting to sell their version of BBQ. While visiting Charlotte, NC with my wife while she had a layover, the main thing I wanted to do was spend a nice day with my her and have authentic BBQ. I searched on Yelp and came across a number of BBQ joints and the one with the most ratings was Midwood Smokehouse. I asked a couple of locals and we were assured that we couldn't go wrong here. The Midwood on Brandywine is one of four restaurant that they own and closest to our hotel. I like that the restaurant didn't go for the BBQ dive look like most do and although it is a newer restaurant it was very clean. Our server was very nice and helpful. I want to try a local beer and she gave me a few samples to try and I went with the Sugar Creek Pale Ale. Slightly sweet and yeasty flavor but doesn't over power the taste of the food your inhaling.  As for the food we decided to share a platter where you pick four proteins. Now my wife isn't a big fan of BBQ but she does like brisket so she let me pick; we had chopped pork, brisket, St. Louis style ribs and my favorite.. burnt ends.  The platter arrived in a nice presentation with hush puppies, a dollop of coleslaw along with our sides of baked beans and Mac n' cheese. My wife tried a burnt in and asked me what it was so I explained the process of making a burnt end and she it was incredible. I have had many burnt ends over the years but these were incredible. I like how Midwood sauces them and caramelizes them at the end. I had no complaints with anything that that I ate. Hickory is one of my favorite woods to smoke with and I like that it gives such great color and if you do it like these guys you get a nice light smokiness to the meat. Our next favorite was the brisket and then ribs and chopped pork. When she came up for air my wife said it was so good the food didn't need BBQ sauce and she was right but the sauces are good too, just not necessary.  So when it comes to BBQ Midwood is the real deal. I'm looking forward to returning to Charlotte and go to their first restaurant.",

I regularly go to the Plaza Midwood location but this location is closer to my house and I was overjoyed to get some smokehouse a little closer to home.   A good friend of mine told me the Smokehouse had opened and I sprinted over... I am not sure if this location has recently opened or if they're smoker just wasn't up to par completely yet... but something was definitely different about this experience.   Don't get me wrong- the service was amazing as usual, the decor was local and lively... everything was basically great... except the Beef Brisket... now I am a beef girl and I like my beef brisket to have some fat and some char on it. But these particular slices of brisket were so smoky in flavor - my mouth literally tasted like I had ash inside my mouth. Again - don't get me wrong... the meat was tender and even juicy in spaces.. but the overwhelming char, fire, smoke taste over powered my ability to enjoy this meal.   I'm convinced this experience was some type of insane weird flawed evening - so I will return and update my review with hopefully better news about the smokehouse brisket.   Now - as for the other sides.... awesome and amazing... per my usual - mach and cheese and the hush puppies that created my love for hush puppies were amazing.",

Business travel happened to have found me in the Charlotte area and I knew it was time to get my meat sweats goin' on!  I checked around and this place had great reviews and was kinda tucked away. I headed over there, easily found parking, and waddled up to the front desk. A young sweetheart greeted me and said it was fine to have a seat at the bar, which I did. The barkeep was a very nice young fella who greeted me straightaway with a menu and a glass of water. I mean seriously, how's that for southern hospitality? I asked for a cocktail and a dinner suggestion, both of which he kindly obliged with solid suggestions. I took his advice and was soon met with a cold drink and a plate of hot food. Super fast, but after all, barbecue has been cooking for hours, it doesn't take long to whip up a plate. They have two kinds of sauce: tomato-based barbecue sauce, and that vinegar-based stuff some folks like. I had the brisket and sausage combo with mixed coleslaw and hush puppies (although I didn't eat the hush puppies because I'm living the low carb life... well I had one-half of one and it was damn good son!). Anyway it was a good, solid meal with nice conversation, which is just what the doctor ordered for a long day on the road.  If you're in the Charlotte vicinity, hit this place. You'll thank me later.",

    "text": "We ate here for my fiance's birthday dinner. He loves barbeque and I wanted to come to this location instead of the original in Plaza Midwood so that our family and friends joining us wouldn't have such a dreadful parking experience. The parking lot was actually pretty busy, but it was restaurant week so I'm sure that contributed to it.   The service we received when I called to make our reservation was absolutely above and beyond. Normally you call a restaurant they ask for how many people are attending and what time and that's it. Midwood Smokehouse asked if we would like to use their private dining room for the birthday gathering, if we had any and all accommodations for elders, babies,  allergies, and if we would be bringing a birthday cake.   The services we received when we arrived matched the host to a T. They were so attentive with every question we asked and the services that we needed.   Of course, I cannot leave out the best part, the FOOD! I ordered the brisket and when the waiter put my food down in front of me I asked if I could have a knife and different waitress said \"Oh you shouldn't need a knife and if you do our kitchen staff will be fired.\" SHE WAS RIGHT! The brisket was so tender and beyond delicious. I had the hush puppies and baked beans, they were both absolutely perfect.   We will definitely be back for both the lovely staff and great food.",

We tried all the sauces loved the sweet habernero one. Then my friend ordered the rib/chicken combo with his puppies and macaroni and I ordered the brisket sandwich on Texas toast with collard greens. Oh lawwdd! When I say the food was delicious...we had our server bring the cook out! So good and I wrapped it up with banana pudding which was amazing! This is going to be my go to place when in North Carolina. I really was that awesome!",

Today I was blown away with all the new items!! I must confess I don't eat beef or pork so I expected to have limited choices but I was delighted to see salmon, tacos, salads with tons of add ons & lots of side options. I chose the Midwood grilled which had Cheddar & Gruyere cheese, smoked onions and a creamy tomato spread on Texas Toast. It was the best grilled cheese I have ever had! I loved the added flavor of the onions & the tomato jam and the Texas Toast gave the perfect crispness to stand up to the generous amount of cheese. For a side I chose the side salad which had avocado, black beans, romaine, cheese, etc. with ranch & avocado green goddess dressings on the side. Yummy! When I eat out I really enjoyed having unexpected & unique food combinations and I definitely had that today. I will be coming back to try more!",

My husband had the chicken and ribs plate so of course I tried the ribs....sooooo damn good! Plus they give different bbq sauce options and my fav was the one with the hint of jalapeno or habanero(I can't remember which pepper hint it was)anyways that was good.  The customer service was amazing! Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Our waiter was knowledgeable and very attentive.  He even surprised us with banana pudding dessert! That was to die for! I can't wait to visit Midwood again",

However, the outside seating looks like a place you could definitely bring your dog one day.   They have drink specials as well. They are:  Monday - $3 off signature drinks Tuesday - $3 NC drafts & $2 off cans over 12 oz Wednesday - 20 oz for the price of 16 oz Thursday - 1/2 price bottles of wine Friday - $2 off bourbon Flights  Sunday - $3 off bloody good choices   We ordered the Queso with chopped up brisket. The brisket was very tender but the cheese could use a little more flavor.                      We ordered a large plate which is more than enough food for two people! The Carolina Pork is what we ordered with a side of bacon wrapped jalapeno's and sweet potato fries. It comes with pickled onions and hush puppies which were excellent complements to the dish! This was such a great deal for only $13!   Overall the experience was delicious and had a homey vibe. *Side Note - bring a coat, it was chilly inside!",

Speaking of location- it's a great location! We had a fantastic server and kind hostess. Good beer. Bad news is... the food was just not good. We did go around 8pm. I just loved their chicken and i was so disappointed because it was very dry. The ribs were not a hot temperature but more Luke warm. The bacon wrapped jalepenos were soggy and the corn pudding needed some salt. Perhaps this was an off night... but I'm willing to try again based off of what I know the plaza Midwood location to be!",

My son and his girlfriend are savvy when it comes to finding which places we should tryout and see.   Midwood Smokehouse was definitely a winner.  It is located in behind Park Road Shopping Center in a very nice building with an outdoor dining area.   We chose to be seated on the patio.  Our server was welcoming and attentive.  They offer \"small plate\" that includes one side, hush puppies and pickled onions and \"large plate\" that gives 2 sides, as well as the hush puppies and pickled onions.   I chose the small plate split 1/2 chicken  Midwood style along with fries and hush puppies.  Husband can never pass up the chance to try ribs.  He said the ribs were very good and he would positively order them again.  The four of us enjoyed our food and the different beverages offered.  My first time here but hopefully not the last.",

Midwood knows smoked meats and absolutely slams side dishes!  Having visited more than this location, I can attest to the fact that they're consistent at any location.  Their smoked wings are just incredible, and without a doubt, are just the best I've ever had anywhere!  The smoked pulled pork and beef brisket or just as tender as can be and so full of flavor that I personally do not even have to add their house made sauce! The beef brisket salad is out of this world, and when combined with their avocado cream dressing, is just heavenly! From their Mack and cheese, to their barbecue baked beans, and their bacon wrapped jalapenos, their sides are a winner no matter what you decide to choose! I have to also add that the staff at this location was just as friendly and helpful as it's been at other locations!  Midwood is the place for smoked meats!",

    "text": "I very rarely give out a 5 Star review. Coming from Colorado, our BBQ options are limited. As a NC native, I know what good BBQ is. On our recent trip back to NC, we had it in our plans to find a really good BBQ place and I think we did. While this restaurant may not be approved of by the purists who think good BBQ only comes from a busted old building with linoleum floors, plastic trays and a ceiling fan, it's approved of by me and my family. Nice decor and televisions to watch various sporting events are a bonus. The prices were very competitive. We tried the brisket, pulled pork, ribs, burnt ends and sausage along with sides of bacon wrapped jalapenos, collard greens and hushpuppies. Everything we had was excellent. The brisket and ribs were up there with the best I have ever had. The sausage had killer flavor. The side items were solid, with the collard greens being the best I've hand, bar none. If I lived locally, I'm afraid of how often I would go to Midwood. Thank you for fulfilling our family's goal of getting good, wood smoked BBQ on our trip.",

I was recently there on a week day for lunch and tried one of their special burgers. The burger is called the Ron Burgandy and it literally changed my life. Although I cannot eat something like that regularly, I will eat it when I can. They were nice enough to make it for me last time I was there and it did not disappoint. The burger has pico de Gallo, guacamole, cheese, French fries and their special ground patty. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Great place for the whole family.",

We are also a family who loves heat and well seasoned food so this took us back to experience all this pepper.  The best thing we ate was the pork and beef burnt ends. Also, our server Heidi provided excellent service!  We first started with the nachos added beef brisket - it had way too much bbq sauce. Dinner consisted of - plate of 4 meats combo dinner for my husband and I (beef burnt ends, chopped pork, and double ribs) with 2 sides (mac-n-cheese and collard greens). Burnt ends amazing, chopped pork full of pepper, ribs not tender... the sides were nothing to talk about at all. Our teen boys chose Pork Burnt Ends with cream corn - Burnt ends were wonderful but the cream corn was full of black pepper which takes away the taste of the corn. The other meal was the TX Brisket sandwich - it was more bread than meat.  Maybe our BBQ standards are too high from having some of the best bbq in Kansas City but this was just average at best.",

I was the only one who complained because I'm not paying that much for a hockey puck. They apologized and remade the burger,  but my poor friends had to drench their burgers in various sauces to make it somewhat palatable. The burger was alright, nothing special 7/10. Their customer service is top notch, but I'm not sure what is going on in the kitchen back there. My friends are now only willing to go back to the original location.",

I dined on the Brisket (they give you an option for lean, fatty, or mixed; I had the lean brisket with the Midwood BBQ sauce. The beef was fine and the sauce was a good compliment. The mac and cheese was A+ and worth every calorie. The plates come with hushpuppies, which were fried crisp. We didn't get dessert but it sure was tempting. The indoor atmosphere looked very appealing, the staff was present, and the food was tasty. It definitely worth the stop if you are in the Park Road Shopping Center and looking for some good ole Southern BBQ.",

    "text": "So I went here today for my Anniversary and 1st let me state the waitress Molly C was rude. The tried to sit us a little table but my husband is 6\"5 and the chairs are to small. We requested a booth and the hosted said they keep the booths open for guest with a party of 8. But when we look over at the booths,  there is guest of 2 sitting in several of the booths. The hostess walks up back up front and tell us we would have to wait until someone get up from the booths closest to the door to be seated, but than changed her mind and seat us in the same booths she told us we could not sit in. After we was seated, I notice the waiter Molly walk over and asked why she put us there and the hostess said I just sat them there, I'm sorry,  \"I am still looking for you a big party.\" So this immediately mad me mad and I knew it was all about the tip. The waitress Molly came and was at 1st rude, it was written all over her face. Later she tried to relax, but kept running to the hostess station, to complain and the hostess kept assuring her that she is sure I big party was going to come in. Molly kept coming to our table to check if we were anything, hoping we were done for she want miss out on a big party if they came in. I asked for a to go box and left her an $11 tip, when our food was only $24, to make her aware that you have to watch how you treat people,  your actions and what you say could have affected your tip and the restaurants business. But I will never go back here again the baked beans was spicy hot, who in they mind serve hot baked beans, I suffer from a medical condition and cannot have spicy food. The cream corn was the only thing edible. The mac and cheese had a cheap taste, and why bring out a handful of onions with hush puppies?  Who in their right mind just going to eat raw sliced onions? The smoked chicken was dry and you could not pull it apart. I was expected garlic bread, but got sour dough toasted bread. Word for the owners please reconsider your ingredients for dishes, you don't know who could have a health condition or could be allergic to something and the waitress is not warning the food is spicy or have onions in it. They can never get my business again, besides feeling discriminated against the food was nasty.",

I didn't have a reservation but just walked up at 6pm on Sat night which is risky but the host was very gracious to offer a spot at the bar where I could stash my bulky guitar case from my unexpected purchase (it happens) and still keep an eye on it.  Sat next to a guy who was from upstate NC who come to Midwood every time he's in town and he recommended the 1/2 chicken with SC mustard sauce. I got the fries and coleslaw as sides and it came with a generous portion of hush puppies. Very tasty!  Fries crisp and coleslaw had the delicious tang of North Carolina. The bartender was very attentive.  I got a good chance to just look around and enjoy the atmosphere being there by myself and I saw a lot of good times, good service and good food. Folks, this is a can't miss place if you are looking for good barbeque. I will be back!",

I did it!  Sydney was our waitress and she was awesome!  Super friendly and took the time to educate my coworker and myself on North Carolina BBQ.  We even met Jenn, one of the managers there who was kind enough to show us the Smoker and explained how all the magic works.  That was awesome!   Lastly, I ordered the following: Carolina Shredded Pork & BBQ Chicken, Brisket, and St. Louis Style ribs, ALL were fantastic and my coworker and I would definitely order ALL of them again.  A must have, is there creamed corn, so good!  Midwood Smokehouse is right up there with ALL the GREAT BBQ smokehouses in the country!!

My girlfriend got the brisket small plate  and it came with hush puppies and pickled onions with a side door of mac and cheese and they ask if you want fat, lean, or both for the brisket. The mac and cheese was very cheesy. I got the 1/2 chicken and it also came with hush puppies and the pickled onions and I received two sides with my plate. I ordered the BBQ baked beans and jalapeno wrapped bacon and they were very delicious. I could've ate a whole plate of them. The waitress we had was very friendly and asked a couple of times how we were doing. If it's a nice day make sure to ask to sit outside. They do run the ac a little low so it does get cold inside.  The patio is a very big area. The BBQ sauce was okay for me. There ice is the best! It's the little chunks that last long. It was to sweet for me but my girlfriend loved it. They have 2 other locations. If your around for BBQ this a place to go!",

The service here is pretty good, nothing to rant about, but not much to compliment either. My sister does not eat pork and their are always chicken options available. Overall a good place, it is is the barbecue that make it worthy of five stars.",

Just arrived from Charlottesville from tasting bbq and this was just so much better. It's been the best bbq I've ever had, but I'm no expert. The hickory sausage is amazing with a sauce inside which explodes in your mouth with all the flavour. The brisket has an out of the ball park Smokey flavour that without any sauce takes you to the forest and back. The ribs are not melting deboning them so they have still some grip to them and finally the pulled chicken reminds me a bit of the Peruvian recipe and is delicious, maybe lacks a bit of smokiness flavour. The decor is nice, with TVs with sports and a nice bar. This is now my excellence standard for bbq. Also got the chance to visit the kitchen and talk to the pit master, incredible artisan!!! And great guy. I'll be back. All for 28$ with unlimited refills of coke and 2 side orders. A joke.",

The food; was over cooked, small (in comparison to the meat we normally receive), and it just wasn't Midwood quality that we had grown to love.   We ordered the Well-Fed, where you can pick 4 proteins. For the $30+ we paid for the meat, we received a small amount, that could barely feed one person. And again, it was over cooked! We are disappointed, and it did not reflect the high esteem we held for this brand.",

    "text": "Ordered takeout from Midwood Smokehouse using Doordash. Here's a breakdown of what was done:  *Small Carolina Pork BBQ plate. It comes with one side(I got Mac and cheese!) and hush puppies-$11.75  *A side of collards greens( Yes!)-$4.00  *Small BBQ Queso-$4.75  *Banana pudding-$3.00  The Carolina BBQ plate was impressive. The small is really large so very happy about it. The BBQ pork is Carolina style with a vinegar based sauce hence the name. Mac and cheese is decent but not earth shattering. My biggest thing is that the smokiness in the meat was a bit overwhelming at times. I'll attempt I dont have a doctorate in BBQing. It's probably just a personal preference but the meat was very smokey. Not that it was a bad meal,the contrary.  I love love love the collards greens. I'm a southern girl and I know my collards. They have vinegar and pork in them! Very yummy if that's how you take your greens.  BBQ queso was different. In a good way. The flavors between the smokey meat and cheddar are complimentary. Comes with tortillas.  Get the banana pudding!! That's all I have to say about the banana pudding.  In conclusion, the food is really nice. I didn't dine in so I can't speak on the service. I'll probably return but wouldn't go out of my way to do so.",

I happened to be in Charlotte for work and knew I had to stop by one of the Midwood locations. They are a brisket house by far, meaning they are a Texas style bbq.  I ordered the four meat combination platter to try everything. I selected the brisket, chopped pork, pulled chicken, and the pork ribs. By far the brisket was the best of the bunch, even though everything was quite tasty. The brisket was melt in your mouth. I selected half lean and half fatty for the brisket. Paired with Mac n cheese and cole slaw, I enjoyed every bite! Come hungry! Definitely will make another trip here.",

    "text": "Oh Midwood, how I love thee. This was the first place my husband and I ate in Charlotte when we decided to move here a few months ago. We had sat at the bar, ordered way too much food, and left happy and stuffed. We ended up moving very close by, so now it's a place we've been visiting about once a week. The staff is so friendly here and the service is great. Whether you sit at the bar, in the dining room, or on the nice patio, it's a relaxing place to have a meal.   We love their nachos with brisket on top, and also the cheese fries with brisket on top. Really, just give me brisket on top of anything and I'm good to go. We often split the pork plate. The pork melts in your mouth and has great flavor, and they also have a lot of great BBQ sauces to put on it. I love their hushpuppies, which are always fresh, and we're also big fans of the mac and cheese, collard greens, and baked beans. The pork plate is so huge we often have leftovers that we heat up with breakfast the next morning, and it's just as good. In general their portions are very large for the price. We always have leftovers, even when we try not to order too much.   Midwood also does take out really well. We ordered their smoked wings, a brisket quesadilla, and pork plate to go, and it was all packed so nicely. The brisket quesadilla is so, so good, so I'd highly recommend that whether you want it as a meal or need a snack to share.   Their banana pudding is also delicious, and they have a lot of great beers on tap including a \"big size\" that my husband beelines for whenever we dine in. They also have great cocktails, which I really didn't expect. I recently had a bourbon/mint/thyme drink that was delicious. There's so many other delicious things on the menu that we have to come back for, especially the ribs. If you're looking for a casual but nice dining experience and great BBQ, check out Midwood.",

The waitress was friendly and the food and drinks were decent. Husband had the Hot Mess Burger (he said it was awesome) and I had the burnt ends with mac n' cheese and hush puppies. I wish I got the brisket instead, as my plate was just alright - hush puppies were super dry, mac n cheese was room temp, plus the appetizer queso dip also came out room temp (a dish I really expect to burn my tongue on). But maybe that's just how things are here. Overall, we ate and were satisfied and got an awesome albeit pricey t-shirt out of it (the \"Praise the Lard\" shirt). If we ever visit Charlotte again I could come back to try something else or visit a different branch.",

This place was amazing.  Awesome customer service!   Brisket 1/2 lean 1/2 fatty- and it was glistening! I did not want to switch or share it with my husband. Next time I want all lean but my husbands prefers it 50/50. ( this is also his goto dish)   Burnt tips cooked with cheerwine- it Friday's special and it was good too. Not as fatty as I expected and its better then I believed.   Kiddos- ordered cheese dip and chips. No one enjoyed the dip but the chips were enjoyed by the kids.    Mac and cheese- kids did not like it but husband enjoyed it.   Grilled veggie- cup size for a size order and I wished there were more vegetables available.   Sweet potatoes- were typical   Hushpuppies- crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. I had to push them away they were so good!   Pickled onions- came with the meal and I had to order a cup full. I loved these and I can't believe I forgot the onions!",

Being a Packer fan i frequent Angry Ale's so decided to try some restaurants in the area.   Original idea was to visit another spot but how can you see BBQ and not want some.  The service was great, food was great and everyone was very personable and attentive. We were talked into trying the Massive Beef Ribs and when i say it's Massive that is an understatement. The beef basically melted right off the bone and cooked to perfection. Also had the lean Beef Brisket with Mac & Cheese which was also excellent. I'll definitely be getting this again but as a sandwich something about bread and Brisket that just sounds right .   Overall, excellent visit and we'll come back again. Just hopping this wasn't a fluke and the service is 5 Star next time. We arrived around noon so I would be interested to see how it is during the evening hours.",

Midwood is perfect if you are craving a great barbecue meal, but want something a little nicer than paper plates and napkins, like some places. This location takes online reservations, which is a huge plus, but it's rare we wait too long for a table. Once there, the servers and bartenders are extremely friendly and it has a really great laid back environment. The drinks are also really yummy! The NC Ginger is one of my favorite drinks in town.  As far as food, so far we haven't gone wrong with anything we have ordered. Of course, the pulled pork and brisket are both phenomenal. All of their sauces are delicious too. However, don't sleep on the smoked salmon and smoked chicken! Both were AWESOME! If you are trying to eat something decently healthy, try a salad with the salmon. So good. The smoked 1/2 chicken is a large portion and soo tender. I could never replicate it at home, even in a smoker. As far as sides, I've enjoyed them all. I love the mac n' cheese. Plus, what's a BBQ meal without mac and cheese?   I always leave full, always wish I had room for the banana pudding. I would definitely recommend coming here for a nice, but no frills date night or dinner with friends! Definitely very family friendly as well!",

Midwood came up on several lists, and I was glad to find a location not too far from the hotel we were staying at (near the airport). This place is not totally what I expected - I commented to my coworker I was traveling with, when we pulled up, I really thought a place like this would look more like a little hole in the wall. From the outside, this place looks suuuuper corporate and boring, the sort of place you'd expect to phone it in, but they do not do that. Service was friendly and quick from start to finish, and the food, while not cheap, is pretty reasonably priced. I went with the \"large\" pork burnt ends for $15, and my only complaint is that it's kinda disingenuous to call it \"large\". I thought I'd leave with left-overs - I did not. I'd call it a \"normal\" size. It was about one proper serving of food, unless you're a tiny middle-aged woman or just not very hungry ;). That's a pretty small complaint, though - I left solidly full.   The two sides I had - mac & cheese and collard greens - were both good but not exceptional. They are, after all, sides, though - the meat is the star, and their pork was sooooo good. Some of the tastiest pork I've had. Their bbq sauces are also delicious. And I also lucked out and happened to be there on Tuesday, when (I didn't know this until I got there) they also have a special running all day, a full pour of all their local craft beers (they had about 8) for just $3.50 - yes please! They even let me taste a couple first before picking one, which I love at breweries but don't usually see at sit-down restaurants if you're not at the bar, but was very helpful, since the one I ended up loving was not the one I was expecting to.",

My husband and I split a combo platter...the ribs were so over cooked you couldn't even pull them apart, the shredded pork was cold, and the brisket was all fat. The Mac and cheese had obviously been sitting for quite some time...the cheese on top was hard while the noodles were complete mush. Our waitress seemed to be incredibly inconvenienced by us so it wasn't worth sending any of it back. We absolutely will not be back. Terrible experience and absolutely not worth the money unless you're willing to pay for overpriced food that tastes like 2 day old leftovers.",

We asked to be moved but there were no other seats available inside. We then asked the parents to get control, but that did not meet with any response except hate stares. The manager said only, \"well, it's a family restaurant.\" The food is good here, but lately the brisket, the \"lean\" version, is too fatty to eat. Used to be edible. We might visit the Central Ave. location again, but with so many other good choices around town, probably not.",

A hotel employee recommend this restaurant to us and I can tell you we are glad they did. 6 of us enjoyed a lot of meat that evenings the brisket was juicy and rich , burnt ends saucy and  flavourful and smoked chicken and ribs amazing.  We didn't have one complaint about this place.  So if your in Charlotte and want smoked meat check this place out , I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

I have been a few times and to both the original location, ballantyne, and now so excited to have this location in my back yard.   I burnt ends are amazing and will certainly get them again but my go to item here is the TexasStyleBrisket Sandwich. This sandwich is loaded with smoked shredded brisket, smoked red onions, and your choice of of cheese. I get the blue cheese and that to me my friends completes it. Well almost completes it because you need the mid wood sauce ( that of a spicy varietal is my choice) but will also use multiple sauces to  get a different flavor each bite.   Sides you can go with a few different options and yep you know I went with the mac and cheese which is a solid choice for sure.  Another side I would recommend is the hickory smoked bacon wrapped jalapenos with jack cheese. Dip these in ranch and  can you say out of bounds:",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I came here after an 8hr lay over at MLB airport and brought an appetite. We arrived 30 min before closing and were welcomed by Robert (GM) and Mary (waitress). We felt bad for coming in last minute but we were REALLY looking forward on trying this place out after our fellow Lyft driver insisted on trying this place out. Mary was an awesome host for walking us through the menu and offering us her suggestions on the go-to choices and giving us such a welcoming vibe.  We ordered the pimento cheese fries and entree shared the the combo platter (brisket, pulled pork/chicken, and jalapeno cheddar sausage) w/ bbq beans, hush puppies, and bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers. Unfortunately, they were out of the pork ribs and low on brisket because those two are what they're most known for. Luckily we managed to try the remaining brisket and wow. It was nothing I've had back in LA. My favorites were the brisket, bbq beans, and pimento fries. Something about those three just sparked my saliva to just just out uncontrollably..  Matter of fact, everything on our table was remarkable. The mustard and spicy bbq sauce: FIRE.  It could've been because it was our first actual meal of the day but holy fuck. Words can't do the savory deliciousness my taste palate endured. I feel like I'm exaggerating real hard but I'm not.   Towards the end we had the privilege having a talk with Robert about the amount of thought and work he and the crew puts into the restaurant and it compelled me enough to leave this review. Really wish Midwood came to la but it wouldn't be the same. It's True what folk say about North/South Carolina being known for their bbqs cause this place right here left a mark for us. And will definitely hit this place up again. Okay, gonna eat my left overs now lol.",

    "text": "Went with friend Peter M.  I had earlier reviewed the Ballantyne location of Midwood, which he read, where I was critical of how crowded and loud that location can be.  Peter suggested that I meet with him over lunch to try his location in south Charlotte.  First, it is a hard place to find.  It is tucked into a shopping area and I do not know Charlotte well, so it took be awhile to find it.  Good news is that there is a large parking lot so it is easy to park.  The dining area is more open and inviting.  There is a step-down level where we ate and had the positive experience of Jennifer as our server.  She was super, taking me through the menu options, which were different from the other Midwood location.  On Peter's recommendation we each had the Hot Mess Hotter Mess.  Was that super great.  It is a chuck & brisket burger patty (Oh, so good!) with creamy bacon jalapeno spread, Monterey Jack & caramelized onions on a bun.  Life does not get much better.  Add the jalapeno poppers for an appetizer and a beer (they have lots of on-tap choices) and you have a meal that is an experience.  Of course, Midwood had the standard array of BBQ ribs, brisket, chicken, sausage, etc.  Those have always been good, regardless of location.  I especially like that they have beef brisket and it is offered fatty, no low fat and in combination.  Nice options.  It seemed that this location had a greater selection of salads and unusual sandwiches such as the Hot Mess that we had.  I might be wrong.  Service was great, conversation with my Yelp! friend Peter M. was interesting and we will most likely try out some other locations together.  Midwood is a solid A-OK.  Worth your visit.",

However, was an underwhelming experience both times I have taken my guests to try North Carolina BBQ.  It was never a problem with service as the staff was always kind and accommodating but the food in my two experiences always came out lukewarm and seemed it was sitting a while before serving.  Also, I have ordered the baked beans each time and it has tasted differently all three times and has been consistently inconsistent.  Also their Carolina vinegar sauce is watery and needs immediate fixes.  I'll probably be back but in no rush.",

You get 2 half pans of meat and 2 half pans of sides. We got chicken and pork as our meats (I personally would have done brisket over chicken but we have non-red meat eaters). We got mac and cheese and baked beans as our sides and got an additional half pan of coleslaw. We also added a half pan of banana pudding for dessert.   Almost everything was delicious. The only complaint I heard was about the chicken. People didn't like that they put a mustard sauce on it. I also thought it was kind of dry. The pork and all of the sides were very good. It was a ton of food. We had 20 people and there were a lot of leftovers. I think you could order a size smaller than they recommended.   They also give you slider buns, barbeque sauce, plates, and utensils. Unfortunately, they don't provide any serving utensils which was inconvenient.   The food was ready at the time I ordered it. They were really helpful and helped me carry it all to my car.   I've eaten here many times, but this was my first group take out order. I would definitely recommend both experiences!",

    "text": "We started our Saturday on a leisurely, lazy pace. We hit Starbucks to start off our day right with various beverages. I parked as we tried to figure out where we wanted to go. One of my friends needed to use the washroom.  After about forty minutes being undecided, I suggested that we have lunch. I had no problem taking a recommendation from my friend's friend. We headed to Midwood Smokehouse.  Getting there was a bit tricky. I missed the odd turn and had to reroute. It's in a plaza that is ridiculously busy. However, when I was closer to the smokehouse, parking was a breeze.  We were immediately seated in a booth. One of my friends had no hesitation in ordering the well-fed combo platter with me. It consists of Carolina chopped pork, beef brisket, St. Louis style pork ribs, hickory smoked sausage, hushpuppies, and mac and cheese.  My other friend does not eat pork. She ordered the barbequed chicken, with onions, hushpuppies, coleslaw, and veggies.  I also got a Diet Coke. You get unlimited refills. I got three drinks in total and got down to 2.5 glasses.  As far as barbeque goes, this place is amazing! The smoked sausage has cheese with some kick to it. It was awesome! The ribs fell off the bone and were so flavourful. My friend and I were nodding in agreement that they were the best ribs that we have ever had. The beef brisket was equally as tender and flavourful.   My friend knew that I have a weakness for mac and cheese. I got more of it. She was so generous. It was perfect.  Before coming to North Carolina, I was doing research on what foods are local to the state. I didn't get much information on it. I learned far more at this restaurant. It offers two types of barbeque sauce: a tomato-based one and a Carolina vinegar-based one. I loved the latter more. It was delicious.  This place also serves hushpuppies. They are deep-fried cornmeal goodness that is a Carolina thing. It tends to accompany barbeque. As a cornmeal lover, the huspuppies were so good and highly addictive!  Even though we were all pretty stuffed, we kicked it up a notch on the food coma scale and shared the chocolate cake. It was incredible! The crunchy chocolate crumble on top was unexpected and worked nicely with the moist, rich chocolate cake. Such a wonderful surprise!  Our server was wonderful. He moved to the States from Spain and was wonderful to chat with. He was attentive to our needs. This place is lucky to have him as an employee.  If you want delicious barbeque with great service, come here. You will not be disappointed.  (133)",

    "text": "I came in here with some rolling papers and a lighter but quickly found out it was NOT that kind of smokehouse. After I got over my brief disappointment I discovered it was my second favorite kind of smokehouse... the barbecue kind!   The set up is really nice and spacious. We went for lunch and were sat immediately and got our food pretty quickly. We tried these bacon wrapped stuff jalapeno peppers that were to die for.   Midwood believes that those who stay ready don't have to get ready. They keep the BBQ sauces on deck on each table and they have wet naps on hand. You'd be surprised how many restaurants serve sticky food items and no wet naps.   The manager came over and checked on our table a couple of time as well. That was pretty dope. Not the kind of dope I expected in a place called Smokehouse but still dope. At least it wasn't named Midwood Traphouse. Although I guess they do move a lot of birds.   While we're here... Lebron James should win the NBA MVP every single year he's in the league. I mean what else does this guy have to do. I think he could take a pick up team from the local YMCA to the NBA finals. We really don't appreciate the greats while they are playing.   He never gets injured, he is an outspoken social critic and he doesn't cheat on his wife. We can't say that about Jordan, Kobe or anyone else you'd consider to be the king of the NBA.  The biggest knock on him is that he moved from Cleveland to Miami when he was 20 something years old. Yeah like YOU wouldn't do that if you could. It's time for people to let the Lebron James hate go and give him his flowers while he can still smell him.",

    "text": "We came to this location a month or so ago because we normally go to the Ballantyne location, but they were still setting up their patio.  We called to reserve a spot since it was nice outside and we had our dog with us.  We were hungry after a day hiking in the mountains so we wanted order a number of appetizers and then also the platter, which we more than likely knew we would take home for leftovers.  We first ordered the fries with pimento cheese, wings, and cornbread (special for that day).  We only received the pimento cheese and cornbread.  We thought the wings would just come with the meal, but they never came.  So either the server wasn't paying attention or just forgot to put them in with the order, and we didn't question her since we had more than enough food, but we would have loved to have tried them since we have actually not had Midwood's wings as much as we've been to multiple locations.  The fries were average to me, would have preferred a thicker fry, then it probably would have been excellent - would be willing to try it with pulled pork next time!  Cornbread was awesome and also made awesome leftovers!  They need to make this a permanent item on the menu.  The platter is normally what we order - we got it with pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and chicken, along with mac and cheese and veggies.  We normally get it with sausage instead of the pulled chicken, but for some reason I wanted to go with the chicken.  Now I understand why I avoid the chicken, it's not that great, it is chewy and just doused in mustard.  Just not my thing.  Pulled pork is the best, brisket is great, as are the ribs.  You know it is great bbq when you don't need to add sauce.  Fantastic meats as is.  Mac and cheese and veggies were good as usual.  Sometimes we get the bacon jalapenos as a side too.  All make for great leftovers as well.  Midwood is by far my favorite bbq place in the Charlotte area.  Food is usually great, but service is always a hit or miss at each location.",

On a recent trip to the (Southern) Queen City, we stopped in Midwood Smokehouse on a recommendation from an acquaintance that previously recommended a national chain restaurant for \"local\" taste and flavor. I was giving Midwood a shot because I researched on Yelp prior to getting into the car and then being disappointed.   The smells made my mouth water as I sat there going over the menu. I was happy to get some local beers, but from what I recall, the menu only lists the breweries (not the actual beer) and the taps rotate from time to time. That's ok, I ended up with a good one.   I ordered brisket and pulled pork. For my sides, I went with baked beans and Mac and cheese. The combo platter also came with hush puppies.   Everything was absolutely delicious and I moaned almost each time I took a bite. The meat was tender, full of flavor and I could've eaten this every day of my life. It was amazing. I believe the baked beans I had were probably the best damn baked beans I've ever had. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the Mac and cheese, but it wasn't horrible, just not good enough to take room in my tummy with all the other goodness going on.   I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner, or maybe even for a drink and snack after work. I'm happy to say that I'm Full Wood for Midwood!",

The only annoying thing was that you were a few steps down and I could see waiters/waitresses passing by and they kept peeping down at our dining area, very distracting given that I was sitting at the table right below them.   It took awhile for our anyone to come over to greet us which was also annoying but once she got there she apologized and we didn't really have a problem with her service afterwards.   The massive rib, if it's available, is a MUST try! It is sooo tender and flavorful (the inside of the rib can be a little salty), you can cut it with a butter knife. THAT's how good it is! I'm salivating just thinking about it.   The smoked wings had a good smoke flavor but to be honest, it was a little dry. I've had better. So basically my 4 stars is on the ribs and their sides! I can't wait to go back and try other BBQ items on their menu.",

    "text": "Midwood Smokehouse has several locations around Charlotte and its surrounding areas.  This one is in the Park Road Shopping area and is quite busy.  The parking is plentiful, as it is located behind the main shopping area.  There are a few handicapped spaces up front.  When we visited, near lunch time, we had to wait a few moments to be seated.  We were quickly served when we were seated in a nice spacious booth near the front windows.  Our waitress was busy, but still attentive.  The food was a disappointment for me, as I'd been to the one on Central and had such a great experience.  We ordered the queso dip which was merely Velveeta heated with Rotel and served with chips (stale!) from a bag.    I have to tell you, if you have a non-barbecue lover in your party, this is not the place for you.  I thought for sure there would be some options for my barbecue hater, but I was wrong.  Luckily, I found chicken tenders as a salad topper and asked could we have an order of those.  We were kindly accommodated.  My son got the smoked beef brisket with a side of macaroni and cheese.  He loved it all, and the meat was perfectly smoked.  I thought the macaroni portion looked a little skimpy, but the flavor was good.  I got the smoked chicken salad and it was just too much.  The balance of actual lettuce to salad toppings was very off, with each mouthful consisting of mostly corn and black beans.  I would definitely not get that again, and left most of it uneaten.  Honestly, I doubt we'll be back, but full disclosure: I am NOT a barbecue fan.  This was my son's choice for his birthday :)  The barbecue lover did love this place.",

He was also easy on the eyes and a southern charmer/flirt. I settled on the brisket  (fatty of course) and the house made jalapeno pepper sausage. The food arrived quickly. The bartender explained the four different types of sauces to me (i.e. house, vinegar-based, mustard-based). He said he wasn't a fan of the mustard sauce (I appreciate honesty) but it compliments the sausage well.   The food: the brisket was great. Not too fatty, and seasoned well. The sausage was spicy but good. As the bartender stated, the mustard sauce a a perfect compliment for the sausage. Two of the three remaining sausages were also tasty. There was one I didn't care for at all. The greens were good. Mac and cheese was not grandma's but a good try. They also offer ginger beer. Thanks to all you Moscow mule drinkers out there, a non drinker like myself can finally find ginger beer widely available! Overall, I would definitely return!",

Crispy meaty chicken bits on an iron platter are a fine 'Howdy do!' followed by tacos and more chicken... $13 taco trio comes with cornslaw and choice of side: el fuego was a nice take on the classic chicken-bacon-ranch taco; stockyard does tex-mex right with brisket, avocado, and pico; red neck brings zippy redsalsa and pulled pork together deliciously. And mac & cheese... Crisped outside, tender smoked 1/2-chicken plus sweet potato fries, smoked veggies, and hush puppies. Wing and leg are good for now, breast and thigh will become someone's lunch.

We had a large group and we ordered 2 pig outs, drinks, bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers and dessert (banana bread pudding and pecan pie). For the pig outs, we tried all the different types of meat: pulled pork, smoked chicken, sausage, ribs, and brisket with mac and cheese, coleslaw and corn bread. Everything was delicious but the highlight had to be the brisket, corn bread and sauces. The brisket was so tender and flavorful! Our waitress was very nice and we even got a semi-private room on the side. If you're looking for NC bbq, you can't go wrong with Midwood! The prices were also very reasonable and the portions were generous.",

Their brisket is perfect with the option of fatty,lean, or a mixed portion. Their bbq is perfect eastern style vinegar based even with the delicious sauces they offer. The burnt ends, the ribs, the chicken; it's hard to choose just one item here! (Go with the \"well fed\" or \"pig out\" for a great sampling) However don't let the yummy plates steer you away from the sandwiches. My favorite is the Texas style brisket sandwich! Get it with pimento cheese and you'll be sure to leave extremely full and satisfied.  As far as side the bbq backed beans are my favorite. This aren't some bushes baked beans heated up and served to you, these beans are packed with flavor and pieces of meat that really deserve its own special name ...midwood's special beans! The Mac and cheese is also a favorite made home style and perfect!  They offer a good drink selection and the atmosphere is good here. Less crowded than the central location but still just as popular. This is by far my favorite place to bring out of town guess looking for great NC food!",

I had the chopped pork, my husband had the ribs, and our son had the chicken tenders; no complaints, everything was great.  We did start with the BBQ queso with brisket and it was average at best, not a do-over.  The banana pudding was also not a do-over, all whipped cream and no pudding.  Overall, an excellent place for dinner and we'll be back!!",

We live in Chantilly and eat here often and have never had a bad experience until this week. That's why I'm not giving one star, which is what I feel like doing.   On Wednesday, my husband took our kids to eat. I was going to come from work to meet them. My husband texted me right after they got there that I might want to rethink meeting them because the server seemed very impaired (\"like she's doing drugs in the bathroom\" were his exact words) and didn't seem like she even heard his order. What followed next was just crazy. She came twice more to ask what they ordered, when she brought the drinks she had to open the kids' drinks at the table and look inside (I have TWO kids, two drinks only) to see which was the water and which was the milk, and when the food finally came out almost an hour later, 3 out of 4 orders were completely wrong. Another server came over and asked if everything was ok. My husband explained to him that everyone's food was wrong- like really wrong and that he had already put in his order 3 times. The other server got a manager who took the order again. The right food did finally come out. When the original server brought the check, we put our card in and she ran it and brought it back. My husband signed it, and then she came over AGAIN and said, \"I'll run this for you and be right back.\" My husband then said, \"you just ran it a minute ago, thanks\" and left.   Nothing comped off the check.",

Started with the smoked wings. Very tender and tasty. Main course was the hickory salmon with a pico salsa. Again very delicious.  Earlier in the week we had the pecan cobbler with ice cream.  Decedent and delicious.  Highly recommend",

My Chicken and Mac and cheese deserve a 3 !  Let me explain why: the chicken breast was like rubber to cut and chew! The manager did inquire and offer another piece (which is why I am giving a 4 star instead of three) I declined as I had eaten most of it, just disappointed . The Mac and cheese had no soul! It was cold and bland, like it had been sitting in a giant pan waiting to end its life :)  Love having this place in the hood and will walk over again and try other dishes. Warning they are new and run out of Ribs early so go early and order right away :)",

I made Leslie aware that I had a very large group (25+) who in turn, made the General Manager Richard Chrestin aware. She informed me that they wouldn't be able to seat the group all at one table, but could have us at a few tables in the same area together. That worked for us and I told Leslie let's book it. She confirmed and I coordinated with my crew to meet there.. I arrive early to let them know I was there and everyone would be pulling up. The host, non friendly and quite sure of himself, told me he had nothing on the list.. I pulled my back and forth with Leslie up for him and confirmed I had the right location in case I screwed up -- right place. I show where Richard was made aware in the messages. They go get him. When he gets to me, he confirms he was aware of my group, but told Leslie they couldn't do it.. I show him all of our messages and what we worked out and he says he doesn't know why she said that..  He wasn't slightly apologetic and lackluster with concern. He said he can scatter us around and we'd have to wait for each table and however many they could seat at that time.. so, his proposal was for us to have our company dinner in batches.. I just walked out to an equally disappointed group.. we had to now try and find somewhere else to go.. Food is always good at Midwood, but don't try to reserve a large group outing here. Take you $1000+ elsewhere.",

Other people (and dogs) came and went, with no problems at all.  In fact the wait staff was so kind to my dog.  Then I think he was a manager because he didn't look like the waiters sat a family behind me. Apparently my dog who was on a leash and tied to my table got in his way (because She's friendly) he told me to reign in my dog or he would ask us to leave.  I have never been threatened with being kicked out of a restaurant before and we were not bothering anybody so I will never return to that restaurant again.

    "text": "So being from out of town, I told myself that I definitely had to get BBQ before I left. Unfortunately, when you're participating in a wedding and staying about 35 minutes from the venue, time runs a bit short. Found this place on Yelp, and we were a little skeptical since it was out in the burbs, but being that we were so short on time, we figured burbs BBQ was better than nothing. Upon first walking in, it was a nice sized space, clean, and pretty modern in terms of decor. My first thought was, well, guess I'm at a chain. Boy could I not have been more wrong. We were seated quickly, and the service was fantastic. The server gave us a rundown on the history and the well known dishes (i.e. the brisket). We got a combination platter of ribs, burnt tips, brisket, and pulled pork. Sides of mac and cheese, beans, and greens. In terms of the sauces, they had a standard BBQ, Carolina vinegar based sauce, a Carolina mustard, and a habanero BBQ.   The brisket was all it was cracked up to be. There was a nice pink ring from the smoking. There was a nice juiciness to it from the fat. Great smoke flavor that did not need sauce at all. Adding the vinegar sauce to the pulled pork definitely enhanced its flavor. The pork was already so tender. The burnt ends though, wow. So tender, smoky, and filled with flavor. The ribs had a nice dry rub to them and were fall off the bone tender. The greens were tender but not completely fall apart, perfect for my liking. Mac and cheese wasn't mind blowing but good. The beans had some chunks of pork in them that enhanced the flavor. I was completely wrong with my assumptions. I would definitely visit again if down in Charlotte.",

Service was super efficient and friendly, I loved the beers on tap and drank many of them. The food was kind of just luke warm when we got it, but I definitely want to try again and see how they are doing now that they've been up and running for awhile.

Their enormous rotating smoker in the back can handle to quantities that they have to produce for how good their 'q' is. The pork is soft and pulls easily without being baby food.

    "text": "Extremely disappointing.  We picked up our take order of ribs and wings at 5:45 p.m. Both items were completely dried out. They obviously had been cooked hours ago. No excuse to give customers food that should have been removed and scraped. Clearly they have no quality control or management just doesn't care.  We have had food before and it was fine. Suggest you look at your food before driving away. The manager obviously does not look or care.",
