Hidden in the Specialty Shops of Southpark off Morrison near Bricktops, William Sonoma, etc. These are the same owners Coco Osteria and Luce. Used to own Il Posto near Phillips Place, but that place closed. Good news is that most of the staff ended up here including the host.   Nice intimate setting with a great outdoor patio that is quiet. White bean dip is given at every table and is sooo tasty. I usually go with a fish (halibut or sole) or pasta dish...can't go wrong with mixing it up each time I go. They always have 2-3 specials that are hard to resist as well. Nice wine list filled with Italian options. I'd recommend Toscana for a relaxing date night...not stuffy or expensive with a great atmosphere.",

I think this is probably one of the best (authentic) Italian places in Charlotte, even though it comes at a price ($150 per couple incl wine).

He was \"in and out\" of our table, had to take several of our orders again, we had to ask for drinks, salads and appetizers repeatedly.  The wait staff was running around endlessly, dinner was not relaxing and on top of all this the food was below standards.",

The food we all had was unanimously considered to be tasty and Great - from the complimentary bean dip starter, to the Seafood Risotto, and that day's special - Pasta di Giorno and its beef ragu sauce.  However, we all felt the service was gruff and surly from our two male waiters who spoke little broken English and apparently forgot how to smile.    The restaurant is small, intimate, cozy and attractive by Chicago standards (where several of us were visiting from).  Unfortunately we were seated at tables near the entrance door, so it felt cold and chilly just like Chicago's weather and our wait staff's service throughout the meal.  I'd certainly rate Toscano much higher. like other Yelp Reviewers, if we had gotten Toscano's better servers and a less drafty table.  Maybe next time...",

I am not a fish person so i can speak for that but the pasta and chicken dishes are very tasty and al dente. The tiramisu is homemade and delicious. If you like chardonnay try the Tormaresca.

    "text": "Toscana looks like you are in Italy from the way the outdoor area is setup to how the inside gives the vibe a small Italian restaurant.  There aren't many items on the menu which made it easier to decide and what to get.  They serve bread and bean butter at each table upon sitting down.  The bread was a little over cooked but still tasted really good.  I like spreading regular butter on my bread so this threw me for a loop.  I actually like the beans and it added an extra flavor to the bread than normal butter would. Next I decided to try the bruschetta.  Bruschetta is a staple of Italian dishes and you can tell a lot about a restaurant on how they make their bruschetta.  The bruschetta tasted good.  It had good flavor and the mozzarella tasted fresh. For the main dish I ordered buttera without the Italian sausage.  Buttera is made up of tubular pasta, sweet peas, tomato cream sauce and Italian sausage.  This dish wasn't that good.  It lacked the flavor that a traditional pasta dish would have.  The reason I was expecting the food to taste more authentic is because that is how they present themselves.  I added crushed red pepper for extra flavor and spice.  Plus the dish was overpriced and the portion was small. Overall it was ok, the service was ok and the food was ok.  I will not be going back.",

The first to take our order, second to bring our food,  third when we requested our check, and lastly to deliver our check (15 minutes after we asked for it). The food was expensive, they offer small portions, and the taste is lacking. I had a pasta dish that was so salty, I could not even taste the noodles. My husband had the Veal Marsala. It tasted more like burnt brown sauce than Marsala.  To top it off the portions were very small. When the bill came and it was $60 we were very shocked. I have no problem spending money on great food, but to spend $60 and to still be hungry is a shame. I wanted to give one star, but I felt bad, so two it is.  Save yourself time and money.

My fiance didn't care for her dish either.  The food was mediocre, high priced and the service was sub par (I had to go ask for my check because I sat for so long without anyone stopping by).

Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed with the outdoor seating courtyard by the water fountain.  It immediately appeared to have a lot of atmosphere.  We entered the restaurant to check in and I was again impressed by the quaint atmosphere indoors.  The hostess was very accommodating and got us a great table outside by the water fountain.    We had read here on Yelp about the complimentary bread and bean dip, so we were surprised that we hadn't gotten any after ordering.  We finally received some (as did other tables) right before our meals came.  Perhaps there was a bread back-up?  The bread was delicious, but the bean dip wasn't actually a \"dip.\"  It was more like whole white beans in oil with seasoning.  Still good, though, but a little messy on the bread.    The food was excellent, although a little pricier and smaller portioned than your Italian restaurant chains, but the pasta is all made fresh in-house.  It was the \"just right\" size so as to fill you up but not leave you overstuffed.  For hearty eaters, though, it probably won't be enough.  Sides are available for an additional charge.  I liked that Toscana had a variety of pasta options; not just the traditional ones.  I tried the Carbonara.  It was very flavorful and creamy.    Our table by the water fountain was perfect for the beautiful evening we were there, and we had a great experience.  Would we come back, though?  Most likely not.  Not for anything that the restaurant did.  The clientele just felt too snooty and \"plastic\" for us.  Fortunately, the servers and hostess with which we came into contact weren't.",

The waitress, can't remember her name was instantly drawn towards the affection we had to each other and fed us accordingly. We started with a lovely bruschetta, and one of my best dishes Caprese- which I normally make fresh at home. For the entree we had a delicious Buttera whilst he had Polo Medici.

This is an EXCELLENT date spot, and has way more character than one might expect.  I highly recommend the salumi and formaggi as an appetizer.  The tartufo is my most favorite cheese in the world.  Creamy and truffle-y.  It's perfect.  The calamari is crispy and delicious as well. Perfectly crunchy.    I sampled the Osso Bucco which was so tender and flavorful.  It had the consistency of a short rib.  I had the snapper special which was lemony and bursting with bright flavors.  I loved every bite!    Tiramisu, one of my favorite desserts, which seems easy to screw up, was outstanding.  Just the right amount of liqueur.    Split a bottle of wine with your date and enjoy a romantic evening out at Toscana!",

    "text": "My husband has been wanting to eat here for months ... his colleagues at work claim that this is \"the best restaurant in Charlotte\" and yet it's never quite made it to the top of our list. Finally, the stars aligned, we got a babysitter with a limited schedule and needed to eat close by and early ... so I grabbed a same-day Friday reservation on Open Table for Toscana. I was excited. I kind of got dressed up. I even wore heels. And then ... mehhh. I'm not sure that I will rush back. The hostess was nice, the ambience was pleasant, the white bean dip was incredibly delicious. But the actual meal ... not so amazing.   We split the calamari and an arugula salad. The salad was delicious. The calamari had to be salted - it was light and crispy but no taste. My husband and I both ordered fish - I had salmon, he had a trout special. His trout was very good and well seasoned. My salmon was too thick and not well seasoned. Again with the salt shaker. Hoping to have better success with dessert we both ordered dessert. Silly, silly us. The desserts were decent but they were huge. Of all the times we decide not to split the dessert... of course. My husband ordered the tiramisu and I ordered the creme brulee. Both desserts were simply too heavy.   Strangely enough, while we were there ... we see my husband's boss and he says, \"This is the best restaurant in Charlotte.\" - in kind of a secretive, hush-hush tone. As I looked around the room, I noticed that we were just about the youngest people in the restaurant by 20 years. So... if you are over 50 and have lived in Charlotte for many, many years, this might be the place for you. I, however, prefer to explore the endless array of inventive eating options that Charlotte continues to serve up and save this place for the regulars.",

    "text": "I recently read a study about how people are much more likely to enjoy a place and write a favorable review if there are already favorable reviews out there, and that's the only way I can account for the good reviews of this place. If I had an elderly aunt who was used to the Olive Garden and had more money than sense, this might be a good place to take her. The food was a step up from the OG (the salads not even that) but nowhere near the quality you'd find in a decent Italian restaurant in Italy, New York or London. The menu is unimaginative and its execution mediocre, and the waiter had the personality of a flounder--I would have called him surly had he actually spoken more than the bare minimum. The patio was pleasant, but hardly a magical place.   I'm happy to pay high prices for great food, drinks, and service, but we left Toscana feeling as if we'd just been mugged. $10.50 for a house gin and tonic. Seriously?",

Started with the beef carpacchio - the beef was room temp and they ran out of truffle oil?! No flavor at all.  For the entree, I had the shrimp rosotto and my friend has the sole. Her fish was so salty, you couldn't eat it (and she loves salt!). My dish had butternut squash in it, but you couldn't taste anything. No shrimp, no squash. Nothing. Not to mention that they served it to me in a dish that was the size of a small salad plate (it took me 6 bites to eat the whole thing!). I'm not saying you have to give me 4 servings of something, but I am saying that if you provide a small portion it better knock me on my ass with flavor.  The desert I chose the torta with chocolate, and it was ok. Left me wishing for a cookie.... a Snickers bar... SOMETHING good and of substanance.   The whole meal was not only small in portions (my friend had 11 bites total, I took 13 over the 3 courses), but they were out of the 2 bottles of wine we asked for. Perhaps they cut corners because it was Restaurant Week, but shouldn't that be a reason to step your game up since so many new people will be trying you for the first time?  One positive: they did bring out a candle in our friend's dessert - it was her birthday :)",

    "text": "We went last night (Wednesday) for our anniversary.  We were planning on Brio, but after reading reviews, thought why not try something different, it's close by.  The atmosphere was nice.  The presentation of all the food was nice.  We had a cocktail while we were looking over the menu, and they were very tasty, and seemed to be stronger than most restaurants server, which we liked.  The service was good.  They had maybe three or four other tables seated, and a lot of staff on hand.  Now why a rating of 2? We were not impressed at all with the food.  The pasta my wife ordered was supposed to have rib-eye beef tips.  The two I saw looked like the tips of fat and gristle that you'd cut off a ribeye while you eat the rest.  The pasta was ok and had good flavor, but not too hard to mess up pasta.  I had the sea bass.  I nice little four ounce portion, with bones through half of it.  I mentioned it to the waiter who explained that to find a bone is very rare and lucky.  Well, it was kind of annoying I thought to have to chew it up into baby food consistency, and then wait until my wife turned her head so I could get the bones out of my mouth and hide them, so as not to ruin the dinner.  Don't know if I'm right or wrong, but knowing it's more on the expensive end, I don't mind paying 25 for a piece of fish or some pasta, but it had better blow me away, instead of wishing I'd gone somewhere else.  The complimentary bean dip was ok.  I'm not an afficionado of it or anything, but I could take it or leave it.  The creme brulee was good.",

I'm not sure if that was a one night thing or if something changed.    What I will caution diners on is the wine list.  I'm not sure I've ever seen such high markups.  The bottles aren't necessarily bad and there's a nice variety, but instead of passing along the pricing on good bottles that cost them $10-15, they're charging $45-$65 for such things.   That strikes me as a little over the top.",

    "text": "We were looking for new places in Charlotte to try for Restaurant Week, and settled on Toscana. I would have given this restaurant 3.5 stars, if not for the awful experience.  For starters, our waiter had the personality of a thumbtack. Didn't smile once, was unfriendly and the minute we said we would be ordering from the Restaurant Week menu, he basically treated us like we were slumming it. Now, I get it. Waitstaff are faced with lower tips sometimes from people ordering off the fixed menu, and that can be frustrating. But we're not those people. I was planning on tipping for the price of the food. That is, until he decided to treat us a second-rate customers.   The food was okay. I had a delicious salad, but was relegated to the only vegetarian option on the main menu. Thankfully, it was a tasty pasta dish. My husband had the crabcake appetizer, which he loved. However, the risotto that was on the menu was not what was served. It was in the menu as lobster and artichoke risotto, and arrived as scallops with some sort of cheese. He said it tasted good, but it wasn't what he ordered.  At this point, the BUSBOY comes over to clear our dishes. He was literally the friendliest person in the entire place. Case in point: he asked if we would like a \"delicious coffee or cappuccino.\" We said no, thank you. Two minutes later our WAITER comes over and grunts \"Coffee?\" at us and when I repeated \"No thank you\" to him, he just walked away. Horrifying. And solidified his tip at the fixed menu price.  If a restaurant doesn't want to use Restaurant Week as a way to secure new customers/business, then don't do it. I would have rather dropped $100.00 at a place that was sincerely interested in retaining me as a regular customer. Very disappointing experience.",

This restaurant is a hidden little gem in the Specialty Shops at the Park (gag, what a lame name for shops.)  I ordered linguini with shrimp, calamari, clams, mussels & cherry tomatoes.  Pretty tasty and for $13, not a bad deal for a pasta dish enough for two and loaded with seafood.  My lunch partner in crime had rigatoni with sausage & peas in a tomato cream sauce. You can't go wrong with anything with heavy cream added!  They have a small express lunch menu for $13, including soup or salad, lunch special and a tea/soda. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon.",

    "text": "ICK! STAY AWAY!!  Went with our dinner group and we were ALL fairly disappointed. First off, we had a party of 10 outside, but they failed to tell us they can't truly seat large parties outside because they only have small round tables. So a few of us were forced to sit between tables, and eat our food off of two different place settings. It was strange.  Then...the service was...adequate. Our hostess was terribly rude and confused. Literally looked us up and down, looked at our reservation, and pointed as she commanded: \"Go sit at the bar.\" No explanation. Just go. Sat down, ordered a ($12 short G&T) drink and watched her seat other members in our party as soon as they walked in. (The table had been set since before we got there). When we went back to the hostess stand, she looked at us and said \"they're outside\" and nothing else, so we just sat ourselves.   And our server? One really can't complain. He kept our waters full. He marked the tables well. He presented us with specials well...but he just seemed,...terribly annoyed. For a ten top of perfection (drinks, apps, salads, entrees AND desserts) we should have at least gotten a smile. And without asking, he brought us one check, and then was quite visibly annoyed when we asked to separate it. Look, I know separating checks is a True pain in the, uh, neck - but sometimes, no MOST of the time, large parties are going to do that. If you have an issue with this - do not seat large parties.  Aaaaand the food? Yelp reviewers really threw me off on this one. I want the food that the other four/five star folks had, because I'm sincerely confused. Maybe Monday night is the 2nd string kitchen staff because...ugh...So very very ICK. Watered down Carbonara that was dripping (which it NEVER should). Squishy mealy\"fresh\" mozzerella w/bland tomatoes. (It's summer in the south people! Tomatoes you can get right!!) Rubbery lobster that you literally could not CUT - let alone chew. And I had a pork ravioli special that had chewy (not al dente - just chewy) pasta filled with something that had the consistency of (I'm sorry, but it's True) cat food and though I've never really dared to dine on that feline canned delicacy, I would imagine it would taste pretty darned close to what I ate at Toscana's.  (Oh...and it is NOT the best tiramasu in town as our server boasted. By FAR!!)  I'm used to eating bad food, but for those prices??? For frozen crap?!?!? And utter rudeness??? Ah Southpark - you striketh again. Make sure you're super snobby and it won't matter what you put on the plates.   It's my SUPER pet peeve. I'll pay almost anything for good food. But hundreds of dollars for food we can't finish and you couldn't pay us to take home - and outright snobbery (for whatevr reason)...really gets my goat!   Unless someone tells me that they've VASTLY improved, we will NOT be going back. And I wouldn't suggest anyone else go either!!",

    "text": "Went for date night with my wife last night.  Had to catch an early movie so we made 5:45 reservations at Toscana.  It was a perfect fall day yesterday so we were greeted promptly and decided to sit on their awesome patio.  This restaurant is tucked away by Williams - Sonoma across from Southpark and could easily, but shouldn't be missed.  It was early so there wasn't many people there but got steadily busier as the nigth progressed. The patio area was for the most part quiet except for the occasional passer by or some skuttle could be overheard from nearby Bricktops.  The fountain added to the ambience nicely.  The service was prompt and attentive without being overbearing.  The specials were well explained and I ordered the Caprese (Tomato, Mozz, Basil) salad which was wonderful with ripe, flavorful tomatoes and fresh tasty mozzarella.  The balsamic was drizzled sparingly so we ordered an extra side.  I chose the grouper as my entree which was nicely pan seared and served on top of potato stacks and accompanied by a nice lobster ragu.  It was well put together and the flavors meshed nicely on the pallette.  My wife had a simple penne pasta with shrimp and zucchini.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  The value of the meal was great and with us sharing a dessert of Tira Misu it cost us $88.00 which is what we expected.    I like Toscana, and have been there before.  Good, consistent flavorful regional Italian dining that should be celebrated in this world of \"never ending pasta bowls\" and \"Family Style Italian\"",

    "text": "Brought my wife here to celebrate her birthday - everything was wonderful and we were both very pleased.  The food was excellent and seemed to be \"authentic\" yet on par with today's standards.  The service was excellent, we wanted to for nothing despite the place being packed.  There was a large table next to us where the patrons were....gregarious, (read: loud) but I guess that's just how it goes.  They too were celebrating a birthday and they outnumbered us (and outvolumned us).  So, I would have preferred a quieter ambiance but at least it was lively.  Made reservations in advance and noted we were celebrating a birthday - they surprise-comped two desserts. I thought that was pretty classy.  All in all I cannot express how pleased we were with the quality of the food.  We will definitely be back sooner than later.  Also looking forward to trying the other related restaurants now.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and his family chose to eat here as a celebration after graduation, so we were expecting a fun and easy going night. We made the reservation at 6:30 for 8 people so we would have plenty of time to get there, but about midway through the graduation ceremony they called and told us they moved our reservation to 6 without any explanation.   We arrived at 6:10 (we got there as quickly as we could) and the first thing the hostess says to us, after we tell her the name of the party, is that we're late and we need to be out by 8 for another large party coming in. We should have left then, but finding a place to eat at 6:30 on a Saturday is not easy.   We sat down and nobody greeted us, spoke to us, or asked if we had any questions about the wine or menu. They simply asked if we were ready to order. We ordered and the food came out approximately 45 minutes later. The food was the only saving grace to this place, but still mediocre in portion size to price. The waiter and hostess was beyond rude and ruined the night for something was supposed to be very joyful. I think the waiter realized how rude he had been and ordered us deserts, but I would hardly call it a favor and more of a pity service since he knew he was already getting an 18% tip included in the check.   There are plenty of other places for authentic Italian and way better service than this place. We will never be going back.",

    "text": "I use the word adore alot.. so i will say J'adore Toscana! Seriously, some of the best lunches and dinners I have had in Charlotte have not been at Del Frisco, Ruth's Chris, Morton's (though I have enjoyed them also) but at this quaint little hard to find spot...  I see someone said the service isn't good, this can be seen both ways, I love the staff there. They speak italian for the most part and struggle a little with communicating, but let me tell you, every time we came in, they knew i took sparkling water instead of flat and the little girl who never said a word to me EVER in all the time I had been going there never failed to automatically brine me my cappuccino at the end of my meal, as if she was reading my mind..  the menu is small, but the risotto and frittata change daily...  my fave is the Rigatoni Buttera and the Bow Tie Pasta dish...  the frittata when I am trying to be good about protein and the caprese is TDF!  The hostess there actually recognized me when she was working over at M5 and was happy to see me there too :)  It is a tiny dining room, but on sunny days you can sit in the courtyard.. the frito misto is yummy to start and share and the bean/oil dip for the bread that they provide is SO YUMMMY!  As a foodie, I really adore this little gem.. it reminds me very much of Europe, even the staff being a little scattered now and then doesn't bother me because that is SO truly italian. in italy they just close the restaurant when they feel like going home or having their own lunch or dinner.. lol..  i guess it is all part of the experience to me..   and they really are nice people...  don't be put off by the language barrier, flash a nice smile, you will get one in return..",

But several things just don't let me do that:  1) Toscana is small and when full, it's so loud you can barely hear others in your party talking. That's not my idea of a nice dinner out. 2) The menu is too similar to Positano (closed for over a year), and Luce. But the prices are higher. Why don't you set your nicest restaurant in the group apart by offering a truly different menu? And two items our group ordered were nothing special (snapper and lasagna). Only my hubby's mare (a high-end version of seafood linguini) was worth getting again. 3) Service was extremely slow, and our server was not very attentive to our group. Again, it wasn't what you would have expected from a high-end restaurant.   I much prefer Luce over Toscana, and will likely never return here for the reasons I mentioned above. If you decide to go, definitely go early to beat the crowd. And try the mare if you like seafood.",

    "text": "Toscano has been serving up wonderful and authentic Italian food for over 10 years and I love authentic Italian food!  I have enjoyed many great meals here at lunch time and at dinner time as well.   Toscano is an excellent escape for lunch if you want to get away from the loud & obnoxious crowds. And, at dinner time, the ambivance is intimate and somewhat romantic.  When the weather is not blazing hot & humid, they have a wonderful little patio tucked in the middle of the Specialty shops which I think should qualify as one the best patios in Charlotte.   This place is nothing like the big chain restaurants.  It is not Americanized-Italian food served in ginormous, family-friendly portions.  If that is what you are looking for, skip Toscano and head over to Maggianos instead.   It is not inexpensive at dinner but for me, it has always been well worth the splurge.  It is a small restaurant and I cannot imagine going here with a  group of more than 4 people. To me, it is at it's best when the restaurant is not too busy (i.e., not during restaurant week) and for smaller, more intimate dinners.   Lunch entrees are typically in the $10 - $12 range with selections of various appetizers, salads, paninis, pastas (including some freshly made in-house), and chicken or fish with fresh vegetables.  Dinner entrees range from $16 - $26 and offer a wide variety of pastas, meats, seafood, and chicken dishes. Of course, at dinner you'll want to start with one or more of the wonderful appetizers as well.   They have a nice selection of wines by the glass or by the bottle - even if you are not an Italian wine afficienado, ask your server for suggestions for they have some really nice Italian wines.  I like to start with a glass of Prosecco before dinner and then switch to something that complements my meal.  After dinner check out the dessert  menu for the after-dinner drinks such as Moscato.",

The inside is nice but not too stuffy.  We had reservations and were immediately seated.  We mentioned to the hostess as we were seated that we just returned from Italy and she asked if we spoke Italian...why yes, yes we do, a little bit anyways.  So when our server arrived to the table, he greeted us in Italian and continued to speak Italian to us the entire evening.  We ordered our meals \"Italian style\"  ordering a primo then secondo and always ending a fabulous meal with a cafe/espresso.  We had another event to attend, so we skipped the antipasta but will certain make our way back for more.  The Chianti wine of the day was fantastic!  We had the pasta della giorno which was a wonderful cetellini noodle with the most tender beef brisket and pecorino to garnish.  Then we enjoyed the sea bass with spinach, fingerling potatoes and the most delicious salami slices.  Not too much of anything!  We then had the tiramisu (may be one of my favorites) and the vinsanto with cantucci (biscotti).  I thought the vinsanto was quite weak, almost a watered down flavor.  The biscotti was very good.  We ended with an espresso.  I would recommend this restaurant for a nice intimate dinner but also for a small gathering of friends.  It would also be a great place to enjoy drinks and share several antipasta dishes.  Everything looked so wonderful and it's nice to know such a great place exists in Charlotte.  Buon apetito!",

The big three, pricing, service and seating is a start.The Christmas menu, while identical to the website, differed in that Christmas pricing had been raised, in some cases $4+ per item. To paraphrase a previous reviewer regarding service issues; they never established a rapport. Our gal never connected, the bus folks never smiled and the Managers (2) wandered around, probably wishing that they were anywhere but there. A pleasant greeting would have been nice, especially given that it was Christmas Eve. I had to ask for bread after the appetizer had arrived and it was stale, hmmmm. Olive oil and parmigiana would have been nice. Coupled with the inflated pricing was seating.There were areas you couldn't walk thru because the rooms had been packed AND chairs were stacked in aisles and by the bathrooms.The entries were served by reaching over and under everyone. The noise level is about a seven on a scale of one to ten. A pet peeve, don't bluff your way through a wine question. Find someone who knows wine and get a legitimate description, especially at $19.50 a glass! All and all, disappointment doesn't cover it. We passed on desserts...",

The price to portion size is definitely not worth it.

I often felt ignored and had to ask multiple times to have my water refilled.

We ordered their calamari (perfection) and a couple salads to start. We then ordered their scallop risotto and fish specials - all delicious. However, we preferred the halibut over the branding because it had more flavor in comparison, but both very good and light. Historically, we've ordered their buttera and seafood mare pastas for takeout - also great but wanted to try something new. The girls had white clam linguine and they finished it off. We concluded with the cheesecake and chocolate marscapone dessert - amazing! Their coffee is also top notch. We had trouble finding a wine that suited our palate, but the staff were extremely patient and determined to find one we preferred.  The setting is an old Italian feel with a lot of warmth and sophistication. We sat in the private events room, but next time I would like to try the main room.  Note: Takeout is sometimes hit or miss when it comes to portions, fresh bread, ample bean dip, but overall, tasty!",

Carpaccio and the mozzarella and tomato appetizers were fantastic. The pasta gnocchi and the scallop entrees were delicious. Easily the best Northern Italian cuisine in Charlotte.  The bad news: The service was atrocious. Our waiter was arrogant, unfriendly, inattentive, unknowledgable and lacking the desire, or perhaps the ability, to engage and establish a rapport with us. It was like he was doing us a big favor by gracing us with his presence.  Its always amazing to me when people who exhibit those attributes find themselves employed in a fine dining establishment, where service is as important as the meal itself. I just don't know how people can survive when they earn a 3% gratuity.  I don't see myself returning to the restaurant again to dine. Perhaps I'll pick up something to go next time.",

Had we not made a reservation, we would've given up. The temperature in the restaurant was wayyyy to hot! The four of us literally had sweat running down our cheeks!  My glasses actually fogged up when I put them on!  The waitress said it was from the entrance door being opened and closed? We weren't anywhere near the doors!  The service was confusing. Too much staff coming to our table. Over handling of our water/wine glasses, often being touched near the rim. All 4 entrees were carried to the table by one server who needed to use his chest/stomach to assist in balancing them. Would've preferred being served separately. Presentation was boring. Food tasted okay which is why I gave the 2 stars.",

    "text": "We had such a wonderful meal and experience at Toscana - I really look forward to returning!  I was with a group of 7 people and we started at the bar for drinks and they served homemade chips. These chips were great! Light, crispy and not at all oily.  Once our entire party was there, we were seated in a backroom which was private and allowed us to enjoy our evening together.   Everyone ordered drinks (with the exception of me ... I'm pregnant!)  Fresh italian bread and a white bean tapenade were brought to the table.  Our waitress was so kind and kept drinks flowing all night. She was really patient going over the specials and gave us plenty of time to pour over the menu to decide what to order.   Everyone split appetizers, we ordered the following: -Calamari (large) -Bruschetta -Carpaccio (can't comment, but the table seemed to enjoy it) -Proscuitto e Burrata (again, couldn't eat this either, but it looked amazing)  The calamari was light, not at all oily and so fresh! The bruschetta was fresh and flavorful. Everything was presented beautifully.  The waitress let us know that we could choose any two of their pastas as well as a meal if we couldn't make a choice on just one.   I had already decided I would be getting pasta because when it is homemade it is my favorite. I ordered the ravioli and the buttera.   Unfortunately, I wasn't in love with the ravioli - I thought the filling was a little granular. But the buttera- mmm - it was fantastic! So creamy and the Italian sausage was cooked to perfection.   For dessert - espressos and aperitifs were had around the table over dessert. At this point I was so full, but I managed to take a bite of the chocolate torte. It was very creamy and almost mousse like.  I look forward to many wonderful meals here in the future!",

The atmosphere was more fine dining than casual but it had a full bar which the bartender attended to me.  She was very attentive and a good conversationalist.    I started my meal with a drink from the full bar and was given breath with a bean and olive oil dip.  I have never eaten anything like it but it was yummy.  I finished the whole starter.  As for the entree, I the got Mare which is my favorite Italian dish.  The dish did not disappoint.  It was full of seafood, half lobster, clam, muscles, shrimp, calamari, and plenty of scallops.  You get a choice of red or white wine sauce.  I chose red.  Once of the best Mare I had.  Highly recommend.",

This is simply the best rigatoni in town, with an unbeatable vodka sauce!  Their service is also top notch...as I've never had any issues with any member of their wait staff.  I haven't been to this old favorite in a long time, but I recently dropped in for a late lunch...and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The food is mediocre  at best! Prices are very high especially for pasta. And tonight it was extremely hot (93 degrees) and they had almost zero air conditioning on! Many people complained and it never turned on. I'm usually the type who wants to sit around after the meal but I was the first person done eating and the first out the door. Seriously, if you want to charge those prices? Pretend you are a fancy restaurant? Etc. You need better staff who actually wants to be there and you nerd air conditioning!",

Needless to say Toscana did not disappoint and again deserved 4 stars...why not 5? Unfortunately we had a new waitress and service/amount of time in between courses and are bill definitely could have been better.  With that said, let me tell you about the restaurant and food.  Toscana is a beautiful restaurant with attention to quality and service!  We had 7:00 reservations and were seated immediately.  The restaurant and bar were packed, which is always a good sign!   As I mentioned above this dinner was during the 2017 Summer Restaurant Week so we had a limited, but a unique menu for this event.  Note: Toscana does allow customers to order from the full menu as well if you are not interested in the Restaurant Week options.  Several restaurants do not offer this.  We started with the mussels and mista and panzanella salads.  I loved the Panzanella, fresh tomatoes and cucumber with a light dressing and basil was my favorite. Others loved the mussels. For the entrees, most stuck with the Risotto of the day, a garlic risotto with lobster, shrimp and fresh peas, it was amazing. I had the Parmesan Crusted Halibut, the fish special of the day, which might have been one of the best cooked fish I have ever had.  The entrees truly did not disappoint. And, finally we ended the evening with Tiramisu, Cheesecake and a Chocolate Torte, all delicious as well.  After this experience I will not go as long as I did before returning to Toscana. I actually want to go back tonight and order from the regular menu, everything was that good!",

And discover it you must, because the restaurant's classy, dimly lit interior may just be one of the most romantic dinner spots in the Queen City -- with food that's as wonderful as the setting. My wife and I dropped in recently during Queen's Feast, and were thoroughly impressed by the wine selection, the service, and just about every aspect of the meal itself.   We started slow, with a pair of salads that paired perfectly with the warm bread and bean dip we just couldn't get enough of. For our entrees, we split the Eggplant Ravioli and the Pollo Farcito, which were both absolutely wonderful. The ravioli were busting with flavor, and the chicken tender and delicious. My only complaint was that both were gone too quickly. But paired with an amazing bottle of Barolo, it all added up to one of the most memorable meals I've had in a while.  For dessert, I tried the outstanding Tiramisu, while my wife enjoyed the Chocolate Torte. If I could give Toscana four-and-a-half stars, I absolutely would -- the disappointing portion sizes were the drawback. But we'll definitely be back for another go.",

My friends ordered the Buttera and the lasagna and both dinners made for the perfect birthday meal! To quote my friend, and fellow yelper, Katherine, the Buttera was \"fresh, delicious meal, and It added a unique spin on the classic dish\"! At the end of our meal, our magnificent waiter, Genevieve, presented my dear friend, Margaux, with a complimentary tiramisu! All in all I was presently surprised by my delicious meal, and I would love to return for more!! I would recommend Toscana for all those who relish in the simplicity of a classic sit down meal and enjoy the exotic tastes that make you feel like you have teleported to Italy!  UPDATE!! Just returned from my dinner about an hour and a half ago, and I have since been sick. I believe It has to do with the food I was served at Toscano's and at the moment It feels like food poisoning. I take back all my kind words and I will never be returning to this god forsaken place. 0/10 recommend. Would give 0 starts but its not an option.",

    "text": "Toscana is a great Italian upscale restaurant. It's a little pricy; however, everything is delicious and fresh (pasta is made in house every day!). We got the gnocchi, buttera, lasagna, and the calamari to start.  The gnocchi was in huge fresh pieces with real mozzarella and basil. It was the best gnocchi I've ever had! The lasagna was fresh and hot. Again, house made pasta. I didn't try much but my friend who got it LOVED it! Finally, the buttera. It was SO GOOD! Penne with tomato cream sauce (so thick and fresh) and Italian sausage. This was my favorite of our three pastas; it was also our server's favorite! Also, our table loved the calamari. I myself can't eat seafood, but the zucchini sticks and tomato dip were delicious! Another nice touch was the bread and bean dip at the beginning! Both so good. And upon hearing it was my friend's birthday, our server brought out a little slice of tiramisu! Overall, Toscana was an excellent choice for a celebratory dinner with a few friends. I could also see it working for date night or even a party! I will definitely be returning.",

I would wait to be seated at an outside table before I sat inside again.   The ladies Bathroom was disgusting. I attached pictures that show the lack of attention to detail.   Bread - Is dry and unappealing! (Get the chips instead) My friend said the bread is the Italian kind you find in Italy. The kind that crumbles. They served it with beans. You can request real butter, which only semi helped. I would order the zucchini appetizer. Never a disappointment!   The pasta was incredible!! Best so far in Charlotte. The sauce is delicious! They put just the right amount. The pasta itself was a little all dente. I will be back just for the pasta!!! I highly recommend Toscana for this reason alone!!!   The drinks were made nicely! Hendrick, Gin-a-tonic and the Pinot Gregio.   Recently my friend ordered the Scallops with couscous. She said if she wasn't starving, she would have left it on the plate. Not tasteful.   Clams with Angel hair pasta - My friend said it's get new favorite dish!!  - She said she might start ordering this from now on. It was that good!!  Our pasta order:  Buttera tubular pasta- italian sausage and sweet peas in a tomato cream sauce $19.95      *minus sausage & peas + buffalo mozzarella cheese  Positano penne pasta- sauteed shrimp, zucchini and cherry tomatoes in a garlic and white wine sauce with pecorino cheese $21.95      *minus shrimp & tomatoes",

    "text": "Second time to this restaurant-again, one of the first places I went to when moving to the area.  The place is small and intimate, but the noise level is high, so can be difficult to have a conversation.  Our first experience was very good, and this was our second visit in about two years.  Made a reservation, and based on the time available, I was really expecting a full restaurant, but when we arrived, there were certainly plenty of tables.  The first person who came to our table was great, but when it came time to order  drinks/wine and food we had a different server, not so great--seemed pompous. My meal was very good--Caesar Salad  and then had the Spaghetti Carbonara.  My dining companion went with the Rock Shrimp Risotto.  The Risotto was good and the arborio rice was cooked well, but they did a poor job of preparing the shrimp.  My taste, very first bite, I had shells on the shrimp, and my dining companion had several bites that contained shells--not good.  At first we brought it up to our server, who was somewhat unresponsive, not sure if he just didn't know how to handle the situation. Eventually asked for a manger, who at first wasn't helpful--I told him we will pay for meal but tell their chef about the shells.  He did apologize, not charge us and gave us a piece of tiramisu with two forks -- wow, but that was never the point.  For the price, they need to make sure every dish they serve is prepared correctly.  Three stars for the experience and price.  If you look at my profile, and I'm in customer service, service is Wauwatosa important as the food.  Not sure if I would rush back to Toscana too fast.",

    "text": "Mare! sums up my description of Toscana. Upon entering the restaurant the atmosphere is quaint ,cozy and charming. The bar boasts a wide selection of Italian wines and other libations if wine is not the drink of choice. There are several bowls of mixed olives to try while waiting for a table. I really love the bright green olives! Once seated for dinner and the food arrived the mare boasted a plethora of shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops I almost forgot pasta was part of the dish. I walked out with leftovers and a well satisfied palate. It is one of those rare seafood pasta dishes that is actually worth the 26.00 dollar price tag. I really wish the service was as good as the food so I could bump the stars up to 4 but I could not justify giving a rating of 4 based on lack of attention. The wait staff needs a makeover.This is especially the case I have observed if you are a party of 2 and not a large group. Large groups seem to get more service and attention than smaller parties. I might add that bad service was observed not one, twice but three times I have visited Toscana. I really wish there were two separate rating scales on Yelp one for food and one for service.",

We went around 6pm so it was not crowded but as we were leaving around 7pm, they started to get a little crowded. They have outside seating and they are a nice, clean little place. The Bass is amazing and my husband enjoyed his pasta. The wine list is great. The desert was bigger than i thought it would be, i could barely finish, but it was awesome. I noticed that other reviewers mentioned that it gets loud when crowded and that the service is slow. I felt that the service was perfect. they let me know that the Bass would take awhile and the waitress gave me plenty of time to enjoy my food and wine. It is a small place but that is part of the charm. it probably does get noisy when they are crowded but the food is amazing and worth the money. The gave us the perfect date before he had to leave for 6 months for work, so we will be coming back to our new favorite Italian place again soon.",

I have been a HUGE fan of Augusto Conte's restaurants for many years, celebrating birthdays, special occasions etc. First, start by asking for the canneli bean dip with the wonderfully crusty Italian bread...it is on the house! Then, if you are a couple split the Portobello salad over greens with Tuscan Fries...unbelievable. Then comes the masterpiece entrees. Whether it is the fresh pastas like the Buttera, the fabulous Osso Bucco or my favorite, Mare. As a former Charllotte restauraurant owner, the Mare is the BEST dish in Charlotte for the price! Excellent fresh shell fish prepared with white wine over linguine...off the charts! This has been one of the top rated restaurants in Charlotte for years. I personally rate it #1. Celebrities abound at this Southpark hotspot, Panthers and Bobcats players and coaches, Rick Flair ( whooo!) Darius Rucker (Hootie and the Blowfish), future Governor Pat McCrory, Mayor Anthony Fox etc. This is the BEST gourmet meal you can have in Charlotte for the price!",

They called my cellphone at 6pm to tell me the 7:30 reservation would be pushed back to 8pm... and when we got there, we waited until 8:45pm only to realize they would be seating 9 girls at a table that looked like it could only hold 6. We cancelled our spot/reservation and the host/owner chased us out the door to see why we were leaving.  When we told him (very politely) that we were hungry and didn't  want to wait any longer, he told us that any other place would take at least 20 mins to be seated...  instead of apologizing and offering any sort of comp....
