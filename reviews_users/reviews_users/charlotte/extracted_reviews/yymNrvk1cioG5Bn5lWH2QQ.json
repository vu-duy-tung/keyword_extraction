    "text": "Second time I've come here, this time with coworkers.   The atmosphere is the usual sports bar/rustic hooters vibe. Nothing special, except for a big stage in the middle of the place. Apparently they host bands on weekends. . .   Service was ok - we had a large group so it wasn't very fast, but the refills were done well and there wasn't a crazy lag between when we ordered and when the food came. In retrospect, that should have been a tip - no way you can make high-quality product for 20 people in 10 minutes unless the fryolator is in overdrive!   Regarding the food - very average. The signature items (wings) are ok, but I've had much better at places like Buffalo Wild Wing, Hooters and Even the ol' Cheeze Moz' pizza place (I miss their coal-fired wings!). The buffalo sauces are very mild, even if you get the very hot ones. . .It's a personal pet peeve, but if it says 'hot' it should be HOT, not less mild. Some friends had the pulled pork sandwich and declared it mediocre at best. I had a salad too (trying to stay healthy) and it was about as vanilla as you can get.   Overall, the only advantage of this place is location (EpiCentre). Even then there are better options around - 5 guys for Burgers, Jason's Deli for salad, Blackfinn for wings, etc.",

Five of us all agreed some wings would do just fine for our late-night appetite, and I've always found Wild Wing Cafe's wings to be consistently delicious.  The service was quick and friendly and yes, the sampler platter with Medium, Red Hot & Bleu, Jalapeno Cheddar, Red Dragon and, my new favorite, Island Jerk were, again, all delicious.  The loaded skins we shared beforehand were amazing!  Perfectly crispy on the outside, and light fluffy on the inside.  My mouth is watering all over again!",

Anyways, so we were seated and no one came to ask us for drinks for another fifteen minutes.   Finally, a server came to ask us for drink and she told us that they ran out of food. All they have is fries. So we just got up since my friends wanted wings.

The flavors were pathetic, and the service was extremely poor. The manager did try to make things right, but it was too late as far as we were concerned.  They should stop trying to create chicken wing flavors that nobody has heard of and go to a much simpler model. Mild, hot, and BBQ, and plenty of them.

About a year ago the place closed down for a bit and went through an overhaul and corporate bought the place up. I, for one, have never had a bad experience here either way... before or after corporate had bought it.   The food is tasty but you need to know what to order. Some items, like the queso and the buffalo dip, are a bit lackluster, nothing great and I'd say save the money and just get something else. I love the little pups here... they are mini hot dogs with chili on them. Simple enough but the chili has a little spice kick (not hot spice but flavorful). And I tend to get the buffalo chicken salad quite often. The salad is huge and will definitely fill you up. The wings give you plenty of options with over 30 flavors - most of the flavors seemed baked on or maybe rubbed on, but if you are expecting hot wings dripping in sauce, you won't get them here.   The location is great, except for paying for parking but hey, that's Uptown's thing, not Wild Wing... plus the light rail runs right behind it so you can always jump on that. Live music on the weekends which makes for great energy in the bar. And a good drink selection, plenty of taps and always a drink on special. I don't make Wild Wing my usual jaunt but if I'm around Trade St, I have no problems stopping in for a bite or sip.",

    "text": "Not epicly bad (pun intended), but I rate this the worst place in the Epicenter that serves food and booze.  Food- Nothing special.  That's True for both the wings and the other food.  Just having an array of flavors isn't a big deal as most places have those now.  None of the flavors I tried were particular bold and the pieces not particularly meaty.  Atmosphere- This place has a feel of some friend of a friend's basement you go to a party at.  Not particular homey or fancy.  The times I've gone they've had some good musicians but the music they played seemed better suited for a coffeehouse than a sports bar.    Service- Can't speak for waiter/waitresses but bar staff is slow.  I try to be somewhat sympathetic here as I know bartending can be a tough job.  But on multiple I've sat at the bar at times where it hasn't been that crowded and I've seen the bartenders moving in slow motion.  One time I asked for a menu but the bartender didn't come back for over 10 minutes.  Usually when people ask for a menu that means they're hungry and want to order something.  When you see how hard some bartenders work at other establishments, particularly on weekends, I think it's fair to call out the WW bartenders as lazy.    Bottomline- If you're at Epicenter and craving food you might have an okay experience here.  But your best bet- and this is True for the entire Epicenter- is too eat before you come here and stick to drinking and having fun elsewhere.  There are a lot better options around Charlotte than having to be stuck with a middle of the road place like this.",

So I get seated and spend the next fifteen minutes waiting for service. No luck so I left. I would of complained to someone but that would of meant someone there actually acknowledging that I was there.This is by far the worst customer service in the epicenter. I hope they go out of business.",

    "text": "Wish I had read the reviews first on Yelp!  The location of the this place is great... but unfortunately that's the only thing I can say that is truly GREAT.  Pros:   Location.  Very good beer prices for what's on tap.  $1.50 draft special.   Pretty good deal.   The appetizers were good, but I'd be surprised if a sports bar/pub could mess up nachos and cheese fries.  They were decent.  Cons:   The food itself is lackluster at best.   With a name like \"Wild Wing Cafe\" you'd think they were wing experts.  This place does NOT do wings well.   They don't compare to Buffalo Wild Wings.   Wings were under-sauced and cooked to a questionable degree of done-ness.    I was looking forward to the homemade blue cheese, which seemed to have a mix of poppy seed and vinegar in there.   It was truly disappointing, as I found no chunks of blue cheese and it tasted like it was 90% mayo.   Not impressed.  Of the 4 of us at dinner, no one left impressed.   We left a lot of food on the table, which is surprising for the group I had with me.   We usually eat and drink a lot.    Sweet Tea was so sweet, I could have sworn it was just guzzling sugar.  I can't say I'm well versed in the sweet tea, but I do drink soda on occasion.  I find Regular coke or pepsi to be fine, but this sweet tea tasted like it had been mixed with 10 giant scoops of sugar per glass.  I took two sips and ordered a beer instead.  Service was ok.  It wasn't terrible, but we found our server missing when we needed attention.   Everyone was pretty friendly.  Overall:   There are tons of great food places in Charlotte.  Go to Buffalo Wild Wings to get your wing fix.   I'd avoid Wild Wing Cafe unless you're desperate.",

    "text": "I have previously had a number of bad wing experiences.  They have been under cooked, many times near raw, and just tossed is bottled hot sauce.  Yuck!  So I was more than a bit hesitant when our two grandchildren and wife opted to have dinner at the Wild Wing.  The menu will knock your socks off, so make sure you are wearing socks as I don't know the potential consequences rising from their menu.  Many, many options ranging from wraps, sandwiches, kabobs, ribs, steak, hamburgers, pizza and...drum roll...WINGS.  Not only wings, but an entire page of sauces with an easy to read color scale of heat intensities.  And which sauces would be good on ribs.  Many were very clever and intriguing.  The choices were difficult with the sauces, but then to determine what to order further burdened, although pleasantly, the diner.  I opted for the ribs and wing combo, choosing a sauce for each item.  Wife had chicken strips with a hot sauce.  Grandchildren, stuck to corn dog bites with smiley-faced fries (really!)  and pizza with mac-cheese, so their lives remained stable, full of unhealthy high calorie food and unchanged.  I quaffed a local draft lager, chosen from a beer menu with at least a dozen drafts and many more bottled brews, along with lots of wine and custom cocktail offerings.  My wings were simply great.  Fried crispy they were perfect...no sogginess at all and the sauce, that I only remember in my mouth,  was yummy.  The ribs were also excellent rivaling ribs served at rib houses.  The unnamed sauce complimented the ribs making a good combo.  The fries were wedges and were also fried perfectly.  Must get the name of their deep fat fryer, type of oil and/or name of the fryer person.  Wife's thick, large hunks of chicken were quite a meal.  Those three pieces were at least double the standard chicken fingers.  Her hot sauce lit her fire, but she did not break out in any sweat.  She simply lost all feeling of her lips and had to pause occasionally to catch her breath and eat pieces of my celery with ranch, made in-house, to cool her pie hole.  The kids consumed great quantities of ketchup as part of their gourmet meals and had no complaints.  In fact, none of us had any complaints at all.",

The food here at the Epicentre location was also good. I enjoyed my Drew's Delicious Chicken Sandwich. The fries were really good too.  One thing I'd like to mention is that it was really cold. I know it's a really cold day around 10 degrees but still. And we were seated at the first table by the door. And the door being what it is, kept opening and we were all shaking and shivering. You should do something about that. Not all places are cold inside because it's cold outside. Other than that, it was a nice place for lunch with colleagues on a weekday.",

We went around 5:15pm on a Friday it was dead inside. Should have been hint number 1. Then we get seated and our waiter seemed very new and possibly just got off training. He was nice enough though. Took our drink orders which took forever to get. Then as he was writing down what we wanted my friend noticed he wrote wings instead of boneless nuggets. She corrected him on my order and we watched him cross it out and write in the correct order. So shocked and surprised was I when my order comes out as wings. UGHHH. I let the waitress no that I actually ordered nuggets and that is when it became even worse. It took 20 minutes for new nuggets to come out. 20 MINUTES! And they were the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever seen and I ordered the mini order of just 6!!!!!!! I didn't say anything at the time but when the waiter came back and asked me how they were I said ok, but it took soooooo long to get them out after the mistake that was made by YOUR TEAM and he just chuckled lightly and said yeah. No apology and nothing. The minute he brought them out too he just sat them in front of me with no apology for the wait or anything and zoomed over to talk to his friend. Poor Customer services guys. I will make sure to tell my friends to steer clear.",

The buffet had a good selection of wings, tater tots, fries, and salad. However, the first plate I picked up had food on it.  So I grab another plate.  After eating my wings and drinking about a quarter of my soft drink, I discovered a nasty toothpick in the bottom of the glass. I showed the soft drink to our waitress, who kind of just shrugged it off as if it was nothing and simply offered another drink.  Who knows how it got in there and who's mouth it was used in.  That's just really disgusting. Considering the toothpick in my drink and the dirty plate at the buffet all during the same trip, I doubt I'll eat there again.",

Went today around 2:30-3pm and it was a ghost town, with the exception of a couple picking up a to go order and a guy that walked in before us. We ended up there because we were catching a movie at SMG and since my bf has never been, we gave it a go. I should have known it was going to be some mess once we walked in and there was not a waiter in sight. We ended up having to just go pick a table, and then one of the waitresses came out of no where. A mess!! She was waiting on us in what seem to be her chill clothes (and a purse on her shoulder. I looked past that and we ordered drinks. She returned 2-4 mins later with our waters and no menus!! When we asked for them she said, \"y'all didn't pick them up at the front\"? Excuse me, what?!?  After she bought them she then went over to the other side of the restaurant to talk to I'm guessing the other waitress about what time they were leaving. When she came to take out order, there was still no other customers that had come in since us and it had been 10 mins at the most when she came to take out orders. The guy that came in before us ending up leaving. So now, we were the only customers in the restaurant. 20 mins later, our food comes and the order is allll wrong. At this point, neither of us want anything to be fixed because we were tired of waiting and had a movie to catch. Question is, how can you mess up the ONLY two orders y'all had?!?! My bf was upset, and asked for the manager. The waitress had a major attitude when we told her we didn't want the food and were going to leave and wanted to speak with the manager to discus then I'll. Here's the funny part. The manager comes out with his arms crossed in a major defensive mode like he's ready to fight. My bf explained to him that both of our orders were wrong and since we didn't eat the food, he wasn't going to pay for it unless that would cause a problem for the restaurant.The manger then tells us he made what we ordered (which was a lie) and that if it was wrong, he have it made over. My bf told him that we were good and told him he shouldn't have to pay because we didn't eat anything.The manager then got very disrespectful along with the waitress and basically told us to leave. NEVER AGAIN! I will be contacting the GM for this location and making sure that some type of reprimanding be done for their behavior today! I've alerted all my friends and family to never go here again and hope they spread the word!!",

The problem though was the fact that we walked by several open tables that suited our group size. We just wrote it off to maybe being down a server. That was until they sat us forty minutes later at one of those very tables that was open when we walked in.  The bartender was good. He moved quickly and was on top of things. He also worked with our server to transfer our tab to our table. A simple thing that many places will not do so it was appreciated.  Our server at the table was also good. He came by often and was friendly. His visits got a little too space out toward the end, but overall it was good.  There are plenty of televisions to catch the game, or many games for that matter. There is a large bar area and a lot of regular seating as well. They had a live band in later in the evening. I am normally ok with this at a bar, but it confuses me at a sports bar. Especially with so many great 8pm games on. Also for whatever reason it was very warm inside. It was slightly crowded at times, but not enough to justify the excessive heat.  The food was ok. I ordered 8 boneless wings in the flaming Parmesan sauce. The sauce had decent flavor, but was certainly not flaming. The wings were large, but slightly over cooked. Not burnt, but overly crisp.  I also ordered the Steel Town Spuds with tater tots. You get a good sized portion. The tots come topped with ranch dressing, bacon, scallions and melted cheese. The flavor was ok. They brought out some buffalo sauce to dip it in and that made it much better.",

Food took an hour to come and still got our food orders wrong. So rude!!!",

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with tots and my boyfriend ordered the turkey GTL. Our server was a little awkward, as in she would pretty much stand there until we addressed her first. She was attentive enough though, and tried to suggest a way for my burger to be cheaper. As for the food itself, my burger was very good and the customizations I asked for were correct, but the tater tots were just as you could make at home or get at a Sonic. My boyfriend said that his wrap was way too small and the chips were \"still potatoes.\" When we paid in cash, we did not receive the coins with our change. We should've gotten $63.33, but we only got $63 even. Given, losing 33 cents is not a huge deal to us. But if the business were to be doing this on purpose, they could rack up a lot of extra money quick and that very much made us uneasy. We probably won't be returning to another Wild Wings Cafe.",

Our waitress was sweet and our order came pretty quickly. We ordered half hot and half atomic hot. We couldn't tell the difference, both were good and hot, just like we like. For some reason though my beers seemed to take a while to get to me, which i didn't like. I think she simply kept forgetting about them. The place had a a big bar area with a small stage for music entertainment during the evening weekend hours I'm assuming, since nothing was goin on while we were there. Lots of Tv's which pleased my son and I as we like to watch football while enjoying yummy wings.  If I'm ever in the epicenter in Charlotte again I wouldn't mind stopping there again.",

But I knew what we were getting into when we walked in & I knew it would be a challenge to eat here & my coworkers actually CHOSE to take me here after & told them multiple times I was veggie so can't really fault the restaurant..... and the fact you offered anything veggie at all, earns you a happy 3-Stars  Veggie options consist of:  Fried Mozz Sticks  House Salad - but I had to ask they HOLD the bacon bits  Baked Potato   Coworkers [all nasty carnivores :-) ] are regulars here; they have the frequent diners card; & they looooooove this place   Chicken Wraps, Shrimp Skewers & Burgers were the day's choices & they all raved about how delish their lunches were - clean plates abound  Also passed by a buffet, filled w/ different wing flavors - people all around w/ plates piled-high w/ wings so I can def vouch for the popularity of this meaty cafe  My plain house salad was plain, plain, plain iceberg lettuce but *lots* of cheese so there were def points for that....but maybe a carrot or tomato would have been nice too  But NO bottled water?!?! What's up w/ THAT?!?!   So overall this is good for the \"regular\" folk who like meat & drink soda or sweet tea but if you're veggie who likes bottled water & are hankering for a sandwich or something other than a plain salad or potato, try elsewhere  We SF people are SO spoiled & picky!",

From the beginning, our service was terrible and everyone in our group thought so. We waited a long time just to receive our drinks we ordered, and in fact, some went to the bar to order drinks instead. We had to ask our server for things that we had already ordered but never received. Our server acted uninterested most of the time. In the restroom, other people who didn't know each other were asking if anyone else had really bad service. Apparently this was the opinion of the majority of the customers there. Also, it wasn't crowded, so they were not overly busy. I have never had a problem with the service at the Ayrsley location and will continue to go there. But the next time I am around EpiCentre, I will go to one of the other restaurants in that area instead.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here for lunch on Monday. We were expecting the usual average food and atmosphere but it seemed like the adults had called in sick and left the place to the kids for the day.  I will start with the hostess who was running around the whole time with waitresses and the kitchen staff instead of greeting guests. When we were seated we were right next to the landshark surf board. I specifically remember the exact seat because there were dust balls attached to the wall that were flowing in the air. It looked kind of like seaweed flowing in the ocean. The table and floor was dirty too with napkins and french fries under the chairs. It wasn't busy so I cant imaging the staff was so overwhelmed with guests they couldn't clean up when people left. The dust thing on the wall had to have been there for a while to get that big. If the part of the restaurant the guests see is dirty what do you think is happening in the kitchen near the food you are about to eat?  After a while our waitress seemed surprised when she stopped over and mentioned we hadn't gotten our food yet. A few minutes later it came out and my wings were dry. If they soak the wings in hot sauce before serving them how long to they have to sit around to dry out? The whole situation was gross but we were hungry and the food was at least hot (maybe they warmed it up in the microwave and that dried the sauce out).  The whole thing was really disappointing because we both love wings, but at least there are other options around.",

We sat at the bar to get faster service and were well taken care of. Our waitress disappeared for a few minute before we ordered, but the other staffed picked up for her. The server spilled some ranch when he brought our order out, but he was quick to apologize and bring more.  My wife had a flatbread and salad, but wasn't a huge fan of the first. She did enjoy the salad though. She did steal a few wings and liked those.  Not a bad place to eat if you are in the epicentre area and looking for a casual,affordable and tasty meal.",

While I'm not a fry-gal, please grill, bake or fry my wings so I am not reminded that it once had skin on it. Well I took my work team here before a Checkers' game since we had some picky kids with us who apparently love Hooters (and I refused to take a work group to Hooters) so I thought this was a good choice. Uck. The wings were so soft that you can see where each feather is plucked out. Blech. The sauces tasted good, but the wings seemed really under done and the meat in the middle was oddly chewy. I definitely prefer wings at Quaker Steak and Lube, Lebowski's or even Burger Co.  Odd.  As for the rest of the crew, DH went for the healthy option and got a grilled chicken breast on rice and that poor thing got the most anemic looking meal ever and it was tiny. As soon as I saw it I knew he would be hungry.  Luckily the dad in the group who brought his Hooters-loving sons got a massive platter of wings, grilled \"feathers\" and tenders so there was lots leftover DH could munch on. Apparently the breaded  tenders were a massive hit and were quite good (and why it wasn't a 1-star review).  As for service, we had to ask if we could place an order and when the server came back to do so, he literally said \"Whaddya want?\"  I think he was irritated that he was wearing coveralls and a cowboy hat for country weekend. Anyway he warmed up very slightly during the meal, but it was definitely evident he did not want to be there, which made us not want to either.",

I recommend trying the LA Toaster sandwich at least once.  The wing bar is hit or miss--more often than not the wing bar is out of wings and you have to wait several minutes for a refill (which usually is short lived as the people waiting swoop in to grab the wings).  Service has gotten better.  I don't know if they got rid of the some of the problem employees or they quit, but I've noticed the servers that seem to have been the worst are now gone.  That's not to say there aren't bad servers there--but it's ALOT better than it was a few months ago.  During the lunch rush there does seem to be too much socializing at the host station--but whatever--overall service is decent.  Complaints: I have really revolve around the constant self-promotion over the muzak.  I'm already here, I don't need to hear the commerical every 5 minutes.  Second, there could be better training at the host station.  There is no reason that people should be waiting to be seated when it is obvious there are numerous tables open.  Bottom line: Definately a great place to eat.  Just don't expect quick service or something spectacular.  Of course, if you go to WWC expecting a Blackfinn enviroment--then you are the problem...not the resturant.",

I went a couple of weeks ago and honestly cannot remember what I ate (which tells how memorable it was). I do however, remember how incredibly slow the service was at this location. I went on a weekday evening with some friends, and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table when there were several empty tables open. After that, we waited at least another 20 minutes before a server even came to take our drink order (this is the point I generally exit, but given that I was with 5 other people, we stayed). Our drinks took over 10 minutes for water and beers came out much later. The food service was also slow and the waiter was not particularly friendly (he wasn't mean, but there was no apology for the extremely slow service even after we mentioned that we had waited almost an hour before our food order was taken). I am pretty big on good service (or at least an attempt to correct poor service) when I go out to eat, so I probably wouldn't recommend this location. I would have likely given this place 1 star if the food wasn't decent.",

So we go elsewhere for a drink and return. The bar is now open and the problem is suppose to be fixed soon.  By the time we finish our beers the problem is fixed and the kitchen is open. Apparently the printers in the kitchen were on the fritz and that's a show stopper for them.  We decided to just stay at the bar and it was great.  Our spunky little bartender was a real treat and had some great beer recommendations.  I ordered the Steel City Spuds and some wings.  The spuds were awesome... plenty of melted cheese and bacon on top and a layer of Ranch below. The fries were cooked perfectly.  The wings were also great... I ordered the Atomic Meltdown flavor which is the 4th down from the hottest.  They were not unbearable at all and I could handle hotter.  Great service and great food... I will return!",

    "text": "So first let me say that I love Wild Wing Cafe. We came here around 9:30 pm and the restaurant was not full AT ALL. The hostess immediately informed that there was a 20 minute wait. We started to leave but then asked if we could order at the bar. We stood at the bar and were literally never acknowledged. The folks at the bar were already complaining that they had never received refills and that the service was horrible. We literally had to flag down 1 of 2 waitresses at the bar who took our order but never made eye contact. We ordered the Wing Sampler with three flavors and Wild Fries. When she was inputting our order into the system she yelled across the bar to confirm our order. Very impersonal. I don't know if they were short staffed or what but that is no excuse for poor customer service.  We waited almost an hour for 1 order of winds ONLY because we 1. Already paid for them and 2. Were genuinely curious at how long it would take.   They appeared to be more focused on pouring drinks than anything else. I saw the most diligence from the busboys.  At least the wings and fries were hot (we had been sitting there so long we decided to eat there.) but we only had 1 ranch and 1 blue cheese, no napkins or silverware, and no sour cream that's supposed to come with the fries. People were leaving and going to other much busier restaurants and eating before us. Apparently this is a regular issue at this location. Save yourself some time, hunger pangs, and frustration and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "This review is in regards to my experience on Saturday April 6th at the uptown location. I had two friends in from out of town for a concert. We decided to go to Wild Wing Cafe prior to. We arrived shortly after 7. Although there were plenty open tables, their seemed to be confusion as to where we would be seated. Once seated, we sat for about 5-10 minutes, when our waitress came up and said she would get our drink order \"in a few minutes.\" That in itself is ridiculous, so we weren't off to a good start. Roughly 10 minutes or so passes by and she finally comes to our table and takes our drink orders, as well as our app and meal orders (since we had plenty of time to look). This was approximately 7:30p. There was some type of discrepancy with another one of her tables, and we could overhear the conflict. Apparently they felt they shouldn't have been charged for an item. A manager was called over, he handled it, and our waitress avoided that area and our table until they left. The entire time we were sitting with no drinks, no appetizers, no food. We watched as she walked by multiple times never even acknowledging her. And I mentioned to my friends that she had never even walked to the bar, so there's no way she could know if our drinks were ready. At around 8pm, she came to our table and advised \"he\" (the guy in the kitchen I guess) lost our ticket. So she had to come over and retake ALL of our orders, both drink and food. I was completely pissed. #1, doesn't she put our order in the computer, so how would someone else lose the piece of per SHE wrote out her orders on. #2 I was pregnant and starving. The entire hour we were there was unacceptable. While our waitress was struggling, we saw multiple waitresses standing around, talking, hugging security, drinking a soda, and all of them looked over at our empty table on multiple occasions. If I could give 0 stars, I would. I will never return to this location.",

    "text": "Fun fact - Epicenter is DEAD when the panthers play at home. Which makes it a perfect place to go. The Lady and I walked in about halfway into the first quarter and were greeted and seated immediately.   They had good drink specials so we had a few to get us to second quarter, and then we ordered food. I got 12 wings, split into two flavors (one was a spicy garlic and the other was like a hot teryaki). The lady got a trio of appetizers that included Mozz sticks, potato skins, and spinach dip. She had previously come here for a yelp event and knew that those items were safe bets. Food came out promptly and piping hot. Wings were good!! I kind of expected them to be dinky, but they're good IMO. The spinach dip and mozz sticks were my favorite out of the Lady's apps, but we kind of picked on these throughout the whole meal.  By the time we asked for the check, I saw that one of the beer specials was incorrectly priced, so I asked it to change. Our waitress returned with a manager and basically explained that something incorrect had happened in the system, and that they can't change it. In exchange though, the manager brought over a BUNCH of coupons to use for next time. I really appreciated both of them taking charge and owning up to mistakes, that definitely made me enjoy my experience here more.   Overall, this will never be my first choice of places to go, but I had to share the positive experience here, especially since Wild Wing usually gets dismissed as a chain and just totally forgotten about.",

It wasn't overly packed and there was plenty of stuff working but they all were running from one side of the restaurant to the next. The hostess was very rude to the customer in front of us. We were seated and out waiter took our drink order and food order at the same time. We waited 30 minutes just to get our drink order that I walked to the bar to get. My beer by this time was hot along with the other drinks that our group ordered. Our waiter didn't even apologize for not getting our drinks to us. When we got our food we were missing an order of fries and my salad had a bug in it. We were never given silverware and had to ask for them. It took almost 10 minutes just got get some along with napkins. Once we got our silverware we asked for our bill right away as we didn't know when then next time our waiter would be back or how long it would take. Once we received our bills they over charged us on our drinks. To top everything else the floor, table, and menus were so sticky. You couldn't even put your arms on the table without pulling them off. It was disgusting! The staff was also talking back about the other customers as they were walking by to where we could over hear them! I can honestly say we will not be back! It was one of the worst experience I've every had! Dirty, rude, and our food was terrible! I never saw a manager in duty or come by to apologize! Please do not give this place your time or money! Stay away from this please!",

There was no wait and great seating with every game on. That was a crowd pleaser. They also had a DJ. The food was okay, I got the chicken feathers with grilled veggie skewers. It was close to $13. My fiance had wings, fries, and a beer. We paid $30. Kind of pricey but again if your a sports fan its well worth it.",

No sports last night, but bought some apps and some beers after hearing about the battle of the bands.  Great music, cool vibe, friendly service, and a wide variety of bar type snacks.

It was a home midday game, so the place wasn't crowded at all. We found a high top right near the bar with no problem and started with some beers on special. I had a Sam Adams Octoberfest for $4.  For food we ordered the app trio with potato skins, spinach dip, and mozzarella sticks all of which were very good. I particularly liked the spinach dip and it comes with tri-colored chips. My fiance also ordered wings and claimed they were very good.  Most impressive here was the service. We were checked on regularly first of all, but then when we went to pay and use a coupon, the register wouldn't let the register ring both that discount and the beer discount ($1 off the Sam Adams from $5), so the manager came over and spoke with us directly and we told her \"no big deal, it's just a dollar, we'd rather save the $5 from the coupon\" or something similar. She was super nice about it and also wound up giving us 4 more coupons. Very pleased with my experience here.  Only gave it 4 stars because it's bar food and nothing quite out of the ordinary.",

Understaffed, under-cleaned and under-managed. I would've assumed - you know what they say when you assume - that with an area like this you would strive to be the best as possible with all the competition around plus all the bodies that show up to the e-center. I guess I'm wrong.  It's a huge place, but I've rarely seen a lot of people there. Sometimes it can take awhile to get seated - especially when it's empty. The staff always seems overwhelmed, which takes you back to my point about understaffage.  Several draft beers to pick from, some locals - Charlotte restaurants should be proud to carry local beer. There are so many great choices in the area!  The food is marginal. It's edible, but certainly not over the top in any way. It definitely needs a pick me up.",

All was forgiven when the food did come out. Very fresh, flavorful, and piping hot! Everything I expect from Wild Wings Cafe. The waitress was apologetic for the wait which I appreciated.

The server stated she had put the order in correctly. Our server took the burger back and we waited for 15 minutes. She returned with a Jalapeno burger WITH Mayo AGAIN.  The server was very apologetic and didn't charge him for the incorrect burger or his ginger ale. We never at any point saw a manager.  Our overall impression was that this restaurant was very unprofessional. We left with my husband still hungry and having to find something to eat after midnight.  Pros: My Mushroom Swiss burger was perfect.  Con: I had to eat it in front of my starving husband. Couldn't even share because of my Mayo",

(The three girls had to finish their conversation)   When we were seated, we needed a chance to look at the menu. The waitress gave us literally 1 minute and stood in the corner... um ok?? So we ordered two 12 count wings; Hot, Chipotle Jolt, Old Yeller & Red Dragon.  We also ordered sweet potato fries... unfortunately the waitress misheard and we got regular fries.   The wings were hot but definitely over cooked. All of the sauces were pretty good but you can't really mess up hot sauce on a wing. Old Yeller was gross & tasted like old mustard. The wings were also SO SMALL. The pic attached doesn't do justice to the size of the wing :(   A couple more things to add... when the waitress & (presumably) a food runner brought the wings to us, they didn't know which wings were which. Ok, no big deal. Except that the food runner made a comment \"they'll figure it out.\" I don't get upset easily but that was just rude. The waitress also never took our menus and never refilled our drinks... just terrible. And it was NOT busy. (Yelp said this place had a waitlist   Throughout the entire meal, staff were at the front of the restaurant chit chatting and on their phone... clearly there is a lot to be done here so maybe they should focus on that. Glad they were having a blast tho! Work should be fun but not when there are customers waiting to speak with someone.   This establishment would be an ok restaurant for someone who is visiting Charlotte & wants to check out the EpiCentre. However, if this place didn't luck out and get this prime real estate, it would've & should've closed down already.   Overpriced. Below average. Spotty service. Will never come here again.",

You would think since the name has wing in it, then maybe, just maybe would be decent but these were probably the worst wings I've ever had. Our food was cole, the wings we're prepared wrong and the taste was just horrible.

Place was pretty empty on a Tuesday night so that was to our benefit since we had a group of 15 all ordering wings separately.  It took a little bit for our wings to come out and not all orders came out right but the majority were pleased.  Our waitress was very accommodating and quick to resolve any issues, too. Without having to ask, she also got us all individual checks.  My wings were tasty and I was able to get all flats which I prefer.  Wings come in options of 6 pieces with one flavor, 12 pieces with 2 flavors and so on.  You can also get a combo of half bone-in wings and half boneless.  The music was good too... with Lauryn Hill and old school playing.  It sounded like they were streaming music as there were some ads in between.  Overall, Wild Wings Cafe hit the spot!",

There were only TWO tables and not one person to greet us at the door. We went to the bar to speak with a manager and 2 employees did not even acknowledge us. Spoke with manager who is not apologetic and acted like she did not care. Overall, I've been to several Wild Wing Cafes through out the East Coast and this is by far the worst Wild Wing on the East Coast.",

I wish I could extrapolate on others in chain because the Wild Wind down in Steele Creek but I can not make that assumption that one in the chain equals all.  Nice Sports Bar atmosphere although bit noisey Service in general was good.  Otherwise, noe descript  Physical tacitly was good abeait a bit noisy  Overall observation: Nice location and remodel is good.,  Can not evaluate food quality since this was not a normal flow and nvere did get a chance to try the local offerings and that is the mail reason I came. I enjoy some of their locations but don't know now this one stacks up.  Bottom line is try at your own risk.  Can not evaluate food since I never inexpert that.  Service was average for an event but does not reflect a normal dining experience.  Comes down to I can not evaluate the food sense  ever had a chance to try any.. Can not evaluate the service since we were special event and attention was diverted elsewhere.  While this was a special event and thing are normally different, suggest you wait till a couple more reviews come in to show that everything  ahs improved.   Otherwise, can not recommet",

ESPECIALLY AFTER A GAME and your restaurant is located downtown the same downtown where the Pathners play. Also with the a wing special. That's like a ice cream shop running out of ice cream. I'm highly upset. I  noticed when guest was coming in no was telling them they was out of wings. The manager \"claimed\" they just had frozen wing.",

The waitress moves super slow (no sense of urgency) I was just informed the kitchen has a wait. Not happy at all! The manager is on the line cooking and can't come out to talk. I'm leaving!

Once our waiter came over, she took our orders to include a glass of water and we didn't see her for another 45 mins. Once she finally came back over, she told us she lost the order sheet and needed to retake our entire order because she never put it in. She never even gave us waters as we waited neither did she tell us that she was busy and that it would be awhile.",

    "text": "Probably the worst one of them all. I work nearby and have had lunch there at least 10 times. The prices are decent but the food quality is hit or miss. The service is normally good, but the reason for my low score is due to the slowness and wait times to get your food. On a few occasions, I've had to get my food to go, after waiting over 40-50 minutes for my food. Also take in mind, this place isn't that busy around 12-1pm for lunch. You'd think it would be, but it's not.   This week, I had another terrible experience. I went to the bar to place a to go order, it went normal. The bartender was nice and attentive, but leave it up to the kitchen to mess things up, as usual. 45 minutes went by and nothing. The bartender went to check on my food and came back and told me they gave my food to someone else. She asked if I wanted to wait for another one, but at that point my lunch break was almost over. Who knew how long I'd have to wait. So, I told her no. She asked if I wanted a coupon and was actually trying to right the wrong, but I declined and told her I wouldn't be back to use it.   When I call my food in, it isn't that big of an issue as I know I can just leave work later to make up for the slowness. But on a few occasions I'd get back to my office and the food just didn't taste right. Which is why I prefer to order the food in person. It's safe to say at this point that I won't be back ever. I never see the same staff there so that tells me the turnover is pretty high, it's no wonder they can't get any consistency.",

The hostess was very rude to the patron in front of us. At one point saying she needed to sit down and get out of her face. When we were seated our waiter took our drink order and our food order at the same time since we were in a hurry to get to our concert. Our drinks took 30 minutes, during that time our waiter never came by our table to update us. We had to go to the bar ourselves to get our drinks. My drink wasn't there and when our waiter finally came back and I asked him about it he said he forgot to let me know they didn't have it. When our food came we were missing an order of fries, one of the salads had a bug in it and we never received silverware to eat our meals. We had to wait another 7 to 8 minutes for that to arrive as well. We asked for the bill right away because we didn't know the next time our waiter would come around. On the bill they overcharged us for our drinks and it had to be corrected. I can honestly say, this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had! There was nothing positive I can say about this place. Rude staff, horrible food, and wait times for everything!! Never saw a manager once the entire time I was there. I could've eaten stadium food and had a better time. Stay away from this place!!!",

It was fine when we first got there but one of our people was in a wheelchair and thus made the night worse. First they wouldn't out a short 4 top in the section by the long high top(where we were). Then the manager refused to put enough tables together as we needed to keep them for other guests.  We were all eating and drinking.  No one was just sitting drinking water. So it was horribly awkward. The waitress was slow and inefficient. We got drinks one at a time and food was so slow some people finished before the others had their wings. No one knew where ye food went though the server wrote in order what we wanted. Meals were messed up. But worst of all we had to go to the bar to refill our water and sweet tea because NO ONE would come refill our glasses. The manager made us unwelcome though we spent hundreds of dollars. It was my first and last trip to this place. No thank you.",

Was expecting there to be more people and a better atmosphere for football, but it was okay.

Their Gold Rush is my favorite flavor (honey bbq with a little spice) and I want to try others but always feel the need to stick with old faithful. I got the Buffarella wrap today and it was fresh, spicy and filling and the name left me feeling extra girly. And they have steak fries, which just rocks. Reasonable prices for lunch but my only gripe was having to flag down our server for our check---being lunch with limited time we had to get back to cubicle land!",

It's the place I always think of when I'm in the mood for wings (even moreso now that NC no longer allows indoor smoking). Yes, they are in EpiCentre so you will likely have to wait during prime time hours, but I think the wait is worth it.    I have never tried the buffet, but I'm not usually a fan of buffets, anyway. I love the fact that you can get your wings with two different sauces. I usually get the eight piece with jalapeno cheddar (my favorite).  And sometimes, I mix it up with The Boss.  Both are dry so your fingers don't get messy - nice!  Service is usually pretty efficient.  We never have to wait for any refills, and food is always delivered in a snap - even during busy times.  I have not been to Buffalo Wild Wings so I have no comparison, but I just prefer the location of WWC instead.  And, with everything so good, why would I want to go anywhere else?",

The woman sweeping the floor had her purse on her shoulder, the hostess barely said two words and we waited for over 15 minutes with not a server in sight. Everyone decided we should go somewhere else and a woman at a table whom had been on her phone with HER purse on the table the entire time told us good bye have a great day. I can only think she worked there for making that comment. The hostess did not say a word as we left. Thanks wild wings. We ended up spending over $400 at Fleming's. Good job",

We sat at our table for 20 minutes trying multiple times to flag down a server, manager, leprechaun, or anyone who would get us food and drink. After 20 minutes of no success we left saying how bad that was to the girl at the hostess stand, we were shrugged off. The next day I sent wild wings an email.... It's now Thursday, no response thus I assume you don't care about your customers.",

Then I finally sit down at the table and asked about what flavored vodkas they had. They said they had none which was surprising since I had them before. So just to prove a point, I went to the main bar and asked for my drink. They magically had it which was phenomenal. I came back to my table and asked to speak to a manager in which he responded he didn't care etc",

Very conveniently located in the upstairs portion of the EpiCenter, the interior layout of this uptown location is pretty snazzy. I've been out to the Wild Wing in the university area and was surprised to see (what seemed like) a little more square footage at this location. The food and service are pretty good here for what few times I've been. The atmosphere is very much like any other low-lighted bar. The crowd varies throughout the week and weekend, especially on the weekends when live bands are booked.  In addition to food, I am always pleased with a late-night restaurant that carries over drink specials into a Friday and Saturday. This is kind of a big deal if I have a DD and want to get a few.   Overall, a great restaurant for late night, but also any time of day really. Pretty sure they validate parking also.",

Someone needs to explain to the hostest that her position it to greet people, let them know how long the wait will be and then take note of the parties' name. Unfortunately, she believes her position is to very rudely tell us she has no idea how long the wait will be and that tables will open up when the football game was over. We stated the game was in the first quarter and she then explained very slowly as if we were idiots that yes a table would open up when the game was over. Her counterpart then said the kitchen was really backed up so it would be way longer than 20 minutes. Guess Wild Wing Cafe doesn't want business from new people living in the area. Happily eaiting at Piedmont Social....they thank you for the business! #worstfirstimpressionever #wildwingcafe #piedmontsocial",

No host at the hostess stand had to wait forever to be seated then on top of that the waiter acted like he was too good for everyone and totally messed up our order and took zero steps to fix the errors!! Then we ordered margaritas and those tasted like 100% mix with no alcohol so we asked for that to be fixed and he laughed with the bartender then added water to it to fix it! No no no that is not okay. Service is a zero here with no management it's so sad to see a waste of a great location. Won't return and will be going to Buffalo Wild Wings from here on!!!",

The ambiance seems good but I did notice that they could give their ceiling fans a cleaning...there were chunks of dust hanging off of a few.   Ok the food... This place is not allergy friendly. My friend ordered the char grilled chicken salad. Apparently everything cooked on the grill here uses butter. They did not offer to cook the chicken or anything in a pan, so sans chicken was her salad. And they charged her full price for it. I ordered the chicken feathers, and they tasted like gas or fuel used to light the grill. I tried to cover it up with blue cheese but that didn't help. My fault for not sending it back. On a positive note, our other friend enjoyed the buffarella chicken wrap and my husband really enjoyed the wings. And it's always a plus when there are wet-naps and soft napkins.",
