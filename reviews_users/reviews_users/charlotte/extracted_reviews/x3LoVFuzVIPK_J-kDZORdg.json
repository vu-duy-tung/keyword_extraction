    "text": "Hello fellow Charlotte community , I came to la unica on taco Tuesday expecting to have a rather decent taco . I knew I was going to have a rather unpleasant experience when I noticed all the gringos.They are lucky that Yelp has allowed me to only do a minimum of a star rating . The service was horrible had raw meat in my tacos. My friend Canelo was with me (a regular) and he was also flabbergasted. Then a service had the audacity to serve my iced tea without ice. I guess trump will make America great again .",

    "text": "This was probably the absolute worst service experience I have ever witnessed! I work in the service industry and am a forgiving person that's gets you may be busy or having an off day but my experience tonight was so bad all we could do was laugh.  If I could give multiple ratings I'd give the food a 3, it was actually pretty tasty.  The drinks, a 2, for an authentic restaurant the obvious lack of fresh juices in a margarita is a bit beneath you, yea?  Service a ZERO! We sat and weren't greeted for about 5 minutes, that's forgivable. The server then took our drink orders and appetizers. We then sat without drinks, alcohol and water included, for at least 15 minutes. No exaggeration required. Our food was then brought out, nothing of which we had ordered, so the food runner went back to the kitchen and minutes later our server brought the correct dishes. After the drop she NEVER came back. Literally. NEVER. My boyfriend, beer empty, finally went to the bar to get another round. About 10 to 15 minutes later, meal finished, still no sign of her. What appeared to be a manager came by and picked up a plate. We asked for our check, he said ok he'd be right back. That NEVER happened.... About 10 minutes later I finally went to the bar and asked the bartender for our check. He went looking for the waitress and he couldn't even find her... He finally came and sat down at the table and wrote down what we had ordered then re rang it under his name at the bar.   What makes this story even crazier, I ran into a friend on the way out and before I could even speak he said that was the absolute worst dining experience he'd ever had. Not sure if we had the same waitress...  We will not be back.",

After having a friend mention it, I gave it a try. I mean it's Mexican right by my house with outdoor seating. It doesn't get much better than that.  This place is your standard Mexican it's no Pacos or Cantina, but it's good! If you're looking for a quick and affordable meal give this place a try. Starting out, the salsa is fresh and they give you mild and spicy- can't complain with that. The queso is simple, but does the trick. I've had the tacos- Al pastor, and a few others, always really fresh. More like street tacos. Last week, I split the 'No name' meal and it was enough food for both of us.  The wait staff is speedy and friendly and I've always been able to get a table outside. I'm glad I gave this place a try. Simple Mexican- I'm a fan. I just hope the word doesn't spread too much about this place, but they deserve more business, so I'll do my Yelp duty and give them a deserved review.",

Steak was good and not chewy/fatty (typical for most places like this). Chicken was cooked perfectly and the tortillas were really good too. Enchiladas were great, simple red sauce with cheese and not greasy. We both had Jalapeno Margaritas, which were a complete win. Overall, we liked it for a night where cooking was not an option.",

I told her I wanted the large can and she said they didn't have it and walked away. I didn't complain.   Fast forward two months- decided to give it another try. I ordered the chicken soup ($10). On the menu above the dish, it said the items come with salad, fries and rice. Mine did not, and when I brought it to my servers attention she said it did not come with that. I argued, pointing out it said in the menu the dish came with sides. She did not concede. After graciously accepting the check, I told her we would never come back. She spoke to her manager about it and he offered to give me 10% on my next visit. I declined their offer and will not return.  Overall the food is pretty good, but portions are nothing to brag about and service is abysmal. There's too many other very good taquerias nearby to waste your time with this one.",

As a matter of fact, he tells my server he's not going to change it and I don't have to pay for my food!! It's mind boggling!! I sat there for at least 30 minutes waiting for this damn manager!

In fact, they were nearly tripping all over each other to serve us.  Two women attempted to take our drink and dinner order.  A nice man  came by to ask if everything was good.  We also liked that the restaurant was playing authentic Mexican music in the background.  It doesn't have the same effect when an ethnic establishment plays American pop music.   Tortilla chips and salsa was brought to our table.  We were given two salsas, one which was described as mild and the other labeled hot.  I immediately went fir the hot one and found it to be mildly spicy.  The mild salsa tasted like canned tomato sauce, We both ordered the number two vegetarian.  It came with a bean burrito, chalupa and quesadilla.  The quesadilla was like the best Mexican grilled cheese ever, and I appreciated the crunch and flavor of the chalupa.  The burrito left me flat.  The sauce tasted like an Italian topping, and the cheese was minimal. The prices were great,  it was nice to get two meals and two drinks for under $30.00.  And I definitely will return for more chalupas and quesadillas!",

Second time I order from this place, my coworker was going to go and I forgot my lunch at home so i had no choice. I called and they said to bring it back and ill get a refund.. well it is now completely out of my way and the whole reason my coworker went was because I obviously couldn't!

    "text": "I've been here for a few Taco Tuesdays, and I kind of think they need to get it together. The first time we arrived early in the evening and they were somehow already out of all salsa other than the hot stuff. Service otherwise was decent at best that visit. Second and third time not so much. Took a while for our server to approach us. There was a lot of confusion between whoever took our drink order and who our server was, thus delaying it even more. Chips came out before any plates or drinks were on the table, noticed this was a pattern across the restaurant. Maybe having a simple water and chip runner when the table is seated would be a good idea. The server forgot to put our appetizer in... I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt being that I have worked in the industry, but the queso app (it's queso, it doesn't take that long) came out after our entrees and when she brought the check she told us that she hadn't added the app to the check yet (I'm assuming she remembered it, told the kitchen to make it, but never put it on the check), took our check back, and added it. Oh and they took our entrees to the wrong table too. The food is good but under-staffing on a popular night is a no-go for me.",

I actually ate more chips at the end just to fill up.  My chimi was understuffed, came with almost no toppings except the bottom quarter-sized tomato slice that most people throw out, a laughable amount of beans, and some  lettuce shreds on the side that had a distinct chemical-flavor ...maybe cleaning solution from a counter? and no rice.   My co-workers Lunch-sized Quesadilla did come with rice...and was a normal portion-size. I was just the lucky one who ordered poorly.  Service was very quiet. We did receive our meals quickly however there wasn't a whole lot of follow up on how anything was.  I did like the salsa and I thought the place itself seemed clean/comfortable.",

Went on a Monday night....very few diners present.  The decor has changed some.  Its casual and comfortable....but the lighting is a bit bright.  Tolerable, but bright.  They serve 2 types of salsa with their chips.  I liked the spicy one best.  It was quite tasty.  The chips weren't bad....but they weren't hot and fresh like at some other places.  My friend had the Nachos.  They looked pretty good and he had no trouble polishing off his plate.  I had the Shrimp Diabla.  It was Shrimp, Onions and mushrooms (which i added) in a spicy red sauce.  I couldnt believe how many shrimp they have me in this dish.  For $11....they had to lose $.   Either that or ive been getting ripped off at every other restaurant i eat shrimp at.  Anyway, it was loaded with shrimp.  The res saice was really really spicy....but not over done.  I really enjoyed my dish.    Be very clear when you decide to do separate checks.  Otherwise, they will split the bill down the middle and run your card.  When we tried to have them correct it, it was explained to us that it would take a few days for the bank to adjust it on our accounts.  My friend got pissed over this, so i doubt we will be back...due to that fact only.  I liked the food....i would dine there again.  Not quite sure why other Yelpers have been giving it such bad press.",

    "text": "My BFF and I have come here multiple times a month for the last several months, admittedly usually on Tuesdays. But even if I celebrate a Taco Tuesday every now and again, I always make sure to add other things to my order, because hogging a table for $4 isn't great. I also tip at least 20%, and if I'm getting tacos, that's based on the original price, not the $1 Tuesday price.  Anyway, on Tuesdays it can be pretty busy, but it's real slow during the week, and that's a shame. I'm always telling people how good it is in the Plaza Midwood Facebook group, but they always want to list other places. IDK man.   They always give us extra chips and salsa too and that's good because we are fatties. I always get some queso. The hot salsa is too hot for me, but I'm a whimp. Even people I know who aren't whimps, like my BFF, need to mix it sometimes. Don't feel bad if you can't do it by itself. Or do, I can't tell you how to live your life.  Also a medium margarita is giant and wonderful.   Today we had Ron and he was super attentive and nice. He kept us all filled up on our food and was always there right before we needed him. He's got a great personality, like most of the wonderful people who work there.   Anyway, go to La Unica.",

We arrived on Monday night and realized we were the only ones in the restaurant (never a good sign). We were greeted and asked immediately if we wanted drinks, so we ordered a Jalapeno Margarita and a house margarita, which were on special. We were also given some chips and salsa. Let me break down our experience:  Margaritas: The Jalapeno did not have much kick to it, but it was drinkable. Unfortunately, as mine (house margarita) was being made I noticed that our waitress and another waitress were sampling different combinations and looked very confused about how to mix the ingredients. Needless to say it tasted like coconut water, so they definitely did not get it right.   Food: Chips were extremely greasy, salsa was sub par. We ordered the cheese dip, which was pretty good but again could not take down anymore of the extremely greased-up chips. We ordered the steak quesadilla and no lie, within 2 minutes we received it from the kitchen. I have to say we make better quesadillas at home. The cheese wasn't even melted inside and it was extremely small (was also not cut).  Service- our waitress was really nice, but it was interesting to note that the other waitresses were sitting at the bar, chatting and on their phones.   We will never be back here. Azteca brings much more to the table and it's worth the drive. I hate to be a pessimist, but I can't imagine this place will stay open very long.",

The parking lot is a little scary with massive potholes, but considering how some other restaurants nearby have such little parking I'll take the washed out gravel pit.  If you have a low rider you may want to be careful though.  They bring out 2 bottles of salsa, 1 hot and 1 mild.  The hot is too hot and the mild is too mild but when I mix them together (75% mild, 25% hot) I get a salsa that has a kick but is still edible.  I'm not a heat seeker so I'm sure some would find the hot salsa to be fairly mild.  The chips are thick and have good flavor.  I've had a few things on the menu and I have been happy. Never too salty or too bland which seems to be how some Mexican restaurants are.  I will be back many more times.",

They seat you with a mild and a hot (and I mean hot) salsa, but you can ask for a creamy, spicy green salsa as well. The staff is always super friendly and make it enjoyable to eat there.

    "text": "Cinco de Mayo at La Unica-Plaza Midwood was, hands down, the WORST dining experience of my life.  We were going with a fairly large group (10 people), so my friend called and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Whoever she talked to said \"no problem\" and gave her the impression that a reservation was scheduled. She later emailed La Unica to confirm the reservation and received no response. Therefore, she went to the restaurant in person to confirm the reservation and was told no reservations would be taken for Cinco de Mayo. I don't know if the original person she talked to had a language barrier or a policy was not set in a timely manner, but that should not have occurred. She asked what we should do to get seating and they told her just arrive 15-20 minutes early.  Our group arrived at the restaurant at 6:15 and were not seated until 7:45. By that point, we were starving and in bad moods. We were also annoyed that our original reservation was not honored. The reason it took so long to get seated is because there were only specific booths that would accommodate our group (which ended up being 7 people) and other customers were lingering. Restaurant staff should have politely explained the situation to those guests to motivate them to stand up or leave. We also presented alternate options to get seated faster such as pushing other tables together or splitting our group up and our suggestions were brushed off by the hostesses.  Once we got a table, some of us had to stand and wait while they scrounged up some chairs for us. Our table was also slanted and only stayed straight if I leaned on it.  Once we were seated, it took 45 minutes to get our drinks after asking about them 2-3 times. We asked the waitress approximately 3 times to please take our food order and she kept saying \"in a minute\" or \"please wait.\" So, we did not get to put our orders in until about 8:45 p.m. People who were seated after us got their food before us. By 9:45, we had not received our food and just asked for our food to be boxed and for our checks to be brought.  At one point, I presented the above facts to a manager. She did not seem particularly concerned and did not do anything to remedy the situation. Talking to us or comping some of our food would have been nice. Instead, the overworked waitress muttered some half-hearted apology.  After waiting an obscene amount of time for food and checks, we eventually got up and left the restaurant. We did not want to just walk out like that, but we felt we had no choice, having lives and jobs to attend to.  So, in sum, we were at La Unica nearly four hours and were seated for over two hours with NO FOOD. I understand it was busy and a holiday, but it was beyond ridiculous! It left a bad taste in my mouth.   We left extremely disappointed, woozy, and hangry. We would have been better off with some lime-a-ritas and Taco Bell in a parking lot.",

Most of the burritos come with nacho cheese on them but I asked to get quest instead since I like it more. It was not a problem! Our waitress was very nice and attentive and food was delicious! Great and similar to any other Mexican restaurant! Only thing I wasn't fond of was my margarita. I usually like the frozen lime ones that most have but this was made in a blender and one of those ice at top liquid at bottom type of frozen margarita. Would get it on ice next time to solve this problem because other than that it was fantastic! Also has a large parking lot in the back so no worries about finding a spot!",

There are about 8 different tacos to pick from, but I always go for the chicken and veggie tacos - they never disappoint.   However, this place is hit or miss on Tuesday- you either get seated right away or will have to wait 15/20 minutes. Service too, but I've had more better experiences with service than worse.  PRO TIP- Ask for the green salsa with your chips. It's free, but you must ask. It's a mix of guac, lime and jalapeno. Great on it's own, or on your tacos. YUMMY!",

They still will bust their rears to get you in and seated, it just might take a bit getting through the 12 people in front of your first.  Full disclosure: I've only been here for Taco Tuesdays ($1). Parking here can be tricky -- several time's I've had to wait for cars to leave. Be patient, it's worth the wait.   Tacos: Al pastor is probably my favorite, followed by the barbacoa & the regular pollo. Chorizo is also decent, but not as good as the others. Serving size is pretty solid -- you'll get a heaping pile of meat, cilantro & onion severed on two corn tortillas. Queso is as to be expected, and the chips & salsas are pretty top notch.  Pro Tip: ask for the green salsa. it's like a cilantro-y avocado blend, maybe? Spicy & delicious.",

The ambience is very cool, they have a nice patio area and the inside is spacious but still intimate. Unfortunately the service was not as fast or attentive as what I am used to and didn't know much about the menu. Again the food was the worst I've had while in Charlotte. The only thing that was worth any time was the spicy salsa and chips which you could buy at Walmart. The area that the restaurant is in is in a growing neighborhood of Plaza Midwood which is great but this place does not hold a. Andre to other restaurants in the area. Just go to Azteca on Woodlawn.",

    "text": "I was very excited about a new place to try on Taco Tuesday.  I found their FB page and a beautiful flyer featuring their 3 options for the $1 Taco Tuesday deal.  At the bottom of the flyer, it lists take out as an option.  This made La Unica my choice for the day over the other taco spot I go to.  Unfortunately, when I arrived, I was told that the tacos were dine-in only.  Since I'd found the flyer on line, I had already made plans to just grab tacos and meet up with someone else after, so we couldn't dine-in this particular day.  That being said, we often do dine-in at places around town, and we love patio seating. We would definitely have come-back to La Unica in the future to sit down and eat, had they handled this differently.   The waitress looked at the flyer I was showing her, and called her manager. The manager agreed that the flyer I was looking at was very confusing as it did list take out on the fire. She went to speak with the owner, and returned briefly after. She agreed that it was a confusing flyer, but restated that the tacos were in fact only dine-in for $1.  I decided to just go back-to my usual taco spot where I can get them take out for $1 only.  This threw a wrench in my plans and set me behind, timewise, for the rest of my night.  I am disappointed in the way that they handled the situation, being in marketing and the service industry, myself. I know it isn't always great to have to discount something, but if they would have handled the situation differently, they could have made a patron for life out of my friends and I.",

So we called the restaurant to let them know of the missing items. The staff member who answered the phone said that they can fix and properly fulfill our order. To do so, we would have to come by the restaurant to pick it up which doesn't make any sense since we ordered for delivery for a reason. In response, the staff member then tried to blame the error of not fulfilling the order on the delivery service. So, instead of trying to fix the problem, the staff member thought it would be better to not fulfill what we ordered and tried the blame game on somebody else. Denying accountability when it is clear that the error lies with you, is not what I would call even decent customer service. We will be ordering from here again.",

It seems there are very few Mexican restaurants close to Uptown that aren't like gourmet taco shops or upscale Mexican food or something else different. Sometimes you just need the classic unlimited chips and salsa place. Speaking of which, they bring you out hot and mild salsa with your chips.  They have a nice covered patio area in the back. Thats where I always sit. Our server most recently was great! She was really on top of things.  They have great lunch specials and if you want one of the lunch specials on a weekend it is only $1extra. Lunch fajitas for the win. My only complaint is that the guacamole is almost flavorless, had to add my own salt and lime.",

They have tons to order but I do like the fact that they have lunch combos every day of the week, only difference is that they're $1 more on weekends. They also offer margarita pitchers for about $12 or $13, can you say BARGAIN?  I went with an enchilada combo that came with rice and beans and it hit the spot. My friend and I also ordered the 'Mexican' guac which was really good and a great sharing portion.  The jalapeno marg I ordered was massive for it's $7 price but it went down quite easily.

The price was good. The service was good.  It's across the street from my friends office so we went there for lunch.   It was good.  So yes I feel confident you could enjoy a Mexican meal here.    I've had better food at other places but for a meal on the cheap on Central Avenue... this is definitely an available option.",

Ordered a margarita which was actually ok. Asked for menu. Asked for waiter to take order. Noticed everyone else had chips and salsa. Looked for waiter, Eli, to come back. Asked for chips. Asked to order again. Waited easily 20 minutes for food. Restaurant was not at all busy. There is a reason for this. Went to restroom. Oh lord, will post pictures and be contacting the health department tomorrow. Food finally gets delivered. No napkins. No silverware. Flagged down waiter again. Waited so I'd have something to eat with. Finally get to get mediocre, room temperature food. Meh. Save your money and go anywhere else on Central Avenue for Mexican food.  Begged for check, like three times.  Please take a looksie at the condition of the restrooms in a very slow restaurant that will be out of business soon. Need to use my own clean bathroom at home after eating here...",

    "text": "Just makes me want to say no no no no no La Unica was a big disappointment unfortunately. I was expecting a lot more from their $1 taco Tuesday night. The only thing that was actually decent was the chicken taco with lettuce, tomato and sour cream for a slight up-charge.  The meat was subpar to what I was expecting with flavorless taste. I would not recommend this place to eat on Taco Tuesday or just in general if the quality of the food that I received that night is any indication of what this restaurant has to offer.  I've been to many Mexican restaurants because it's one of my favorite categories of food to eat and this is by far one of the worst. They are the bad generic brand of Mexican food. Pay a little extra for something better.   If you like plain food and bare minimum service than come to this place. The only thing that was better than the chicken taco was the free chips and salsa. It was actually really good.  This place honestly feels like they are a barely making it by and trying to pass off quality food with cheap prices but it doesn't work. You pay for what you get here in terms of quality.   I am not rush to come back but if daring to go give it a try at least get the chips and salsa with drinks.",

    "text": "No frills here, just some cheap Mexican food that hits the spot. This place is 5 minutes from my house, so it often wins during my hungover, queso craving recovery days.   They bring you both a mild and spicy salsa with your chips. Pro tip: ask for the green salsa as well. Spicy and delicious. When asking for queso, make sure to specify dip or else you'll end up with a side of shredded cheese.   Tuesdays can get pretty busy here for dollar authentic tacos. I like that they have a long list of options for this (chicken, steak, chorizo, veggies, beef tongue, shredded beef, chunky or roast pork). Most places skimp on $1 nights and only give you a couple choices. Aside from dollar taco night, the entire menu (especially for lunch) is pretty cheap.   Nice covered patio. The bathrooms are located in the space between La Unica and Kickstand. The parking lot is kind of rough, so make sure to just pay attention and drive carefully.",

We were flipping through the menu looking for the drinks and then I asked what page the drink menu is on and she says oh let me go grab it for you. Then we finally order drinks. My boyfriend gets a Miller Lite. The rim of the bottle had a white paper/ paste looking residue on it so he shows her and she brings him a new one - great! We order our food and it comes out in a reasonable amount of time. I order a quesadilla and my boyfriend ordered the ACP. Every other restaurant we have been to has an ACP that has queso or cheese dip drizzled over the chicken and rice. Not here! A pile of shredded cheese on top. He was very disappointed. He asks for a side of queso and the tortillas that were supposed to come with it that he didn't get. She says okay I will bring those out. 5 minutes go by. 10 minutes go by and nothing! He starts eating his dry food because it's getting cold. We finally see her to stop her to ask where it is and she said the kitchen is backed up...?!?! Tortillas don't need to be handcrafted and the cheese dip is probably in a container in the back. After that we had enough and asked for our check. She says I'm sorry it's just the kitchen. Keep in mind there were only 5 other occupied tables in the whole place. No other compensation or explanation. Think twice before going here! We will not be back.",

Upon sitting you get your usually chips and salsa but they give you both a mild & a hot salsa. They have about 8 different $1 authentic tacos that come with cilantro & onions but you can add cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream for .30 cent more which is still good. I got the barbacoa, chorizo, and asada they were all really good but the barbacoa was hands down my favorite so I ordered two more. I will definitely be coming back.",

First let me say the entrance to this place is not clear at all. Having parked on the side road next door, I assumed the entrance was in the front. I walked around and straight into their kitchen. Ok note to self not the entrance. The told me the next door over, at this point the only other door I see is for a burger place, confused as all get out, I walk in. Awkward and confused, I think ok maybe it is some weird fusion concept. Finally I am directed through their shared entry way to la unica. I'm sorry, but there is no reason for such confusion with the entry way! Put up a sign or something! I had avoided the parking lot behind the place because of other reviews stating how precarious the driving situation could be back there, so I didn't see the patios til after the fact.   Ordered a frozen margarita and made it a point to ask for it to be less sweet and with salt. Came out tasting like diabetes and with sugar on the rim. To make matters worse, the tacos were atrocious. Ordered two barbacoa, one carnitas, and one lengua. Specifically inquired how the lengua was cut before hand was told it was thinly sliced and of course it came out diced -.-. Barbacoa had no flavor other than oil it definitely needed seasoning. The carnitas was flavourful, but the neat to tortilla ratio was off. Waited almost an hour for our credit card to be returned because they were out of receipt paper? Entered at 6:30 and was waiting to leave til 9:00. Kinda crazy for 4 tacos and a drink!   Overall there are better places in the area with better food. Skip La Unica and head up Central towards Albamarle Rd for authentic tacos at a better price and higher quality.",

It's a little strange to get into this location. From Central Ave, there isn't really a \"front\". The door which looks like a front door is actually a door that goes to their kitchen. So, you need to enter though Kickstand or the back. There's an awesome outdoor patio and the best part is the mega margs. I was hoping for a jalapeno marg, but it didn't come in the mega size, but our server was great enough to provide me with that one!

    "text": "The margarita tasted like lime juice and sugar. It was terrible. Our server was very nice but seemed to get flustered very quickly when asked any questions. We kept trying to get someone's attention to get our check and when we finally did we had our money out to pay she just dropped the check and didn't come back for ten minutes.  It was about 8:30 on a Tuesday and it didn't seem like they were very busy so I'm not sure why it took so long. The food was pretty good. Aside from the fact one menu item was described as 'spicy' and wasn't even mildly spicy. I know that they are still in their early stages of opening so I may give them another chance in a few months but I won't be returning any time soon.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. I use to go to another Mexican Restaurant in the plaza midwood area and it was the only place I went for almost a year. Well the service started getting slack and the food fell off a little bit. My fiance and I decided to try La Unica and it was just ok the first couple  times but good enough for us to keep trying. And I am so glad we did keep coming back because it seems like they've done a complete 360. The food has always been on point but now the service is great too. I work in the industry and service is a make it or break it for me. You can have the best food in town but if you can't it right or hot or in a timely manner then I'll go find someone who will get me mediocre food like I want it. I feel like we literally see every server in the restaurant; whether it's bringing out chips or bringing our drinks or taking our order. That's what I call awesome; every server in the place should be just as focused on the other servers tables as they are on theirs to ensure everyone is always taken care of. I truly appreciate a Mexican restaurant with food that's always right, hot and timely and service that is quick, efficient and attentive. It's hard to find!",

    "text": "The only reason why I'm giving the restaurant a 3 star is because of the long wait for us to get our food & the check. The food was absolutely delicious, the menu is extensive with chocked available & the prices are decent. My only complain is with the server and the service provided.",

    "text": "I hate to give a one star review. The servers were very nice; unfortunately they were very inattentive. They got an order wrong and barely checked on us; I was parched all through our Wednesday night dinner. I got the arroz con pollo, and it was more than disappointing. After searching for the chicken and rice in my meal, I was left with an actual half a plate of just onion. I won't be going back.",
