We shared a variety of small plates and vegetable paella.  Overall the food was good and our server was very friendly.  We just went to a tapas place in Las Vegas a couple of days ago and this place was not quite there, but close enough.  Olive oil cake needs whipped cream to counter the dry cake in my opinion.  Overall a solid 4 star.",

The location is perfect being right next to Superica, Jeni's, and being right off the East/West light rail stop. The GM was great with us as well as our servers. Very professional and knew their dishes and wines well. The ambiance is amazing. The red sangria was excellent and we tried three other red wines that we all loved. We had paella, lamb, a potato tart, just to name a few. We tried a few cheeses (Drunken Goat was everyone's favorite). We also got to try the chocolate cake, olive oil cake, and flan. I was close to tears of joy as every dish came out. Barcelona, I love you and will be back often.",

    "text": "Having spent some time enjoying tapas in Spain and in the US, we were excited to dive in to Barcelona Wine Bar's food and wine selection.  Like most folks I look at atmosphere/up-fit, service/staff, wait time, and dining experience/food quality and presentation.  The atmosphere did not disappoint and the restaurant, with 200+ seats, was packed and buzzing.    Mostly professional Millennial's eating there, and mostly tatoo'd and trendy young staff.    Wait time was 20 minutes beyond our reservation time.  Staff were \"OK\", and somewhat cross trained, although our female server kept barging in when we were talking rather than waiting a second...and needed to be reminded several times as we initially sat without drinks and then later with empty wine glasses for 10 minutes after our first glass of wine.    We ordered calamari and prawns a-la-plancha as well as Paella Marisos (for 2)  as our entree. The calamari was lightly battered, not too heavy, but on the chewy side (I like it crispy) - not sure if it was fresh or had been frozen - and it came with a very nice remoulade sauce. Prawns were good sized but also chewy.  The Paella came out and it was so burned that it was really not palatable.  The waitress said \"this is the way Paella is cooked\".  While some may serve Paella with a very slight char on the sides of the pan, I can you that this is NOT how Paella is made or served.  We ate around all of the burned portions about a 1/4 of the Paella (around the severely burned portions), and left the rest.  I was in disbelief that a Chef would ever send an entree like this to a table - but I guess he was slammed and more focused on volume than quality. In my estimation, especially when dealing with  first time customers, it is better to send the customer a comp tapas or a glass of comped wine and the customer have a slightly longer wait than to send out a bad entree.  Very bad first impression and it will stick with us.    Wine at Barcelona Wine Bar is served 100% by the glass pricing with no bottle price discount, unusual and focused on profit maximization rather than market convention.    Bathrooms are unisex with \"WC\"  for Water Closet on doors (a British nomenclature in a Spanish restaurant - should I have ordered a Black and Tan to drink?).    The Spanish wine selection of the wine list is \"ok\" but not what you would expect for a Tapas joint.    Overall, I would not go back in the near future for dinner...perhaps if it were strictly for a glass of wine and a quick tapas after work.    The Paella needs a lot of work and the chef needs to pay more attention to entree's and not just tapas (small plates).  Maybe in 6 months to a year the chef will find his groove...we may check it out again after enjoying some more established chef's offerings at other Charlotte restaurants.",

We were expecting a wait so didn't mind being quoted 45 minutes for the patio because it was a really nice evening and a holiday weekend. The host let us know we were welcome to get a drink at the bar and there was some standing room if we wanted to wait outside. As soon as we found a small gap in people at the bar a bartender was waiting to take out order so that was really nice to not have to flag someone down. After being seated we ordered a red sangria pitcher -amazing. A charcuterie board, oysters, artichoke, and potato tortilla -all delicious. We also ended up getting the pork belly and meatballs which were so good we ordered extra bread so we could savor the sauce both came in. Because it was my friends birthday they brought complimentary olive oil cake and crepes and they were so amazing. I seriously can't wait to come back here. Loved the people who worked here, the rustic atmosphere and decor and delicious food and wine.",

Dishes are supposed to come out slowly giving you time to enjoy each tapa without them getting cold. At this place, everything felt rushed and pushy.  We sat at the 4 top inside near the exit door by the back patio. We sat down at 5:15 on a Thurs. All the waitors who weren't busy, would huddle around our table and watch us eat. I felt like I was being babysat for the amount of times people came over to the table asking to order more. I felt rushed. After the restaurant started getting busier, the noise increased tremendously, I couldn't hear the convo at my table. The place was packed and it was crazy how loud the music was being played.   I think this place is extremely overrated. It was so crowded by the bar area, it was stressful finding the restrooms. This whole experience made me not want to come back anytime soon.",

The bartenders and wait staff are fantastic, very nice and knowledgeable!   Having just returned from 3 months abroad in Argentina and Spain,  I was impressed with the wine list. A ton of options from these 2 countries!   Now, on to the food - the disappointing part. In True European fashion, they brought delicious bread and olive oil to start. For the tapas: Patatas bravas: the only redeeming dish we had Jamon serrano: terrible! This is what Spain is known for and they did it wrong. Pimientos: undercooked! This is one of my favorite Spanish dishes but these were not done well. Albondigas: flavorless. Skip! Oysters: horrible! Was there even an oyster hiding in there under all of the bread crumbs?! Pork belly: overcooked & also flavorless (they tried to make it better but failed with too much salt) Croquetas: meh. I can make these better myself.  For $160 without tip and this restaurant being the new \"rave\" in town, I expected better. To top it all off, we all had stomach issues during the night. Overall, I'd recommend this place for the wine, bread, and atmosphere...not the food!",

She canceled her order by that time she didn't want to eat at 8:45pm. The manager came to apologized and explained that they were missing the main ingredient and had to make a trip to the store. You would think that they would be more prepared as the night went on. I'm sure the dish wasn't the first to be ordered at 8pm. Regardless, the manager packed the dinner to go for my friend and gave the three of us Tapas tokens for the next dining outing.   The manager was the saving grace of how he handled the situation.",

I've been to the DC location, which I think is the first, and while they are different in many ways the core components that make them successful are all here.   Barcelona is at it's heart a tapas restaurant and bar all set up in a way that allows for the guests to socialize both indoors and outside.   The menus vary by location since each local Chef can change up to 60% of the menu. The bar is full service even though it is called a Wine bar. They have plenty of specialty drinks you will want to try.   Now about the food, it is outstanding. Make sure you try a little bit of everything including things you may not normally eat. It's a place where being adventurous will pay off.",

We purposely went early for dinner and drinks because we knew it gets crowded starting about 6pm. The restaurant has an old rustic feel and has a great back patio. We asked our server for recommendations on drinks and tapas and her picks were great! We had a charcuterie board, meatballs, shrimp, and empanadas. The wines are available in 3 oz or 6 oz pours. We weren't sure about the wine flights, so she picked three 3 oz pours for a \"make your own flight\" based on our preference.  I'm glad there's another great wine bar in Charlotte!",

At first, I was reluctant to come here because I read a bad review about it on Facebook but shortly after I decided I want to try it out on my own.  Our server Dawn was outstanding. I can't say enough good things about her. She spent quality time with my guest and I. She explained the menu, offered many great tapas and helped me chose things I was scared to try. My drink was always full and she was very informative. She made the experience.  Second, the food was DIVINE! I mean everything I ate was delicious. Calamari, crisp, with a good aioli. Patatas were seasoned to perfection, and crisp. The bread was warm and accompanied by olive oil. The olives were.. well you can't mess up olives. The shrimp was GREAT! Spicy and warm. Charcuterie board was great. Brussels sprouts were crisp and seasoned well and lastly... the desserts.  The Olive oil cake sounds weird but is like a cornbread that melts in your mouth. The flan is AMAZING. Overall, I would recommend this place a hundred times and please do yourself a favor and ask for Dawn.  Another plus: the manager came and introduced himself to us and made sure everything was good. I love when placers take the time to do this. A+ for Barcelona!",

This place is beautifully designed with reclaimed wood, hanging plants, and pretty lighting fixtures. When you walk in, there's a beautiful buffet table that serves as the hostess stand. A group of 5 of us came on a Monday night and only waited a few minutes before being seated at a hightop booth. Our server came around right away to bring waters and ask what we would like to drink. Being indecisive with SO many wine options, she sent over the sommelier (fancy!). We ultimately decided against a bottle so that we could try glasses of multiple things, but the wine list was inclusive of bottles everywhere from $30-$200 per bottle. Glasses were $7-14ish. I ordered two glasses during my meal, both different tempranillo wines and both recommendations from the waitress actually and I very much enjoyed both!  For food, our group ordered the charcuterie to start with the Jamon Serrano (super yummy thinly sliced ham), Cana de Cabra (very soft goat cheese, like brie), and the manchego (my fav spanish cheese! nutty). We then had the Patatas Bravas (roasted potatoes with tangy sauce), roasted brussels (perfectly crisped), and then shared the Jamon & Manchego Croquetas which are basically fried balls of ham and cheese. Everything was excellent! We then got an amazing dessert that was basically a crepe with a very light fluffy cream and hazelnut chocolate drizzle. It was a helluva meal!  Shout out to our waitress, Erin, who was training and still did great!!!!",

I highly recommend going between 4-6 on a weekday so that you don't have to wait or just take the afternoon off from work and plan an afternoon around it :) Sit back and enjoy some tapas and wine and really saver the moment. Our wait staff was exceptional, even though it was a rotation since they are still training. If they didn't know something they asked instead of acting like they did. My friend and I ordered some meat and cheese to start and some olives. If you enjoy olives, I highly recommend that you get a side because they are well worth it. It also came with bread and delicious olive oil. That in itself was plenty of food. Thankfully we didn't order all of the tapas that we had originally thought we could eat because we were beyond stuffed. We did end up trying the croquettes which were very tasty. They also provided us with some \"love\" which happened to be an order of grilled hanger steak with truffle oil vinaigrette. We felt the love! I can't wait to come back and enjoy all the things that my eyes thought that I could fit in my stomach!!",

We got there (make sure you leave a lot of time to find parking) and we're seated. The first thing either of us remarked was, \"wow this place is loud.\" Even at 7pm on a Tuesday night the music and overall atmosphere were so loud that I couldn't even hear our server as she was talking to us. The charcuterie boards are amazing. I'd recommend the chorizo and Romero cheese. Our tapas were the hanger steak (really incredible), grilled yellow squash, and pulpo (octopus). We really loved the food-- it was all incredible. Really, the only thing that makes me not want to return is just the noise level. It is impossible to hear even the person sitting right across from you at the table. If noise doesn't bother you in that way, though, you'll have a 5-star experience for sure.",

We tried a lot of dishes but still didn't really make a dent in their menu-you have a ton of options! Everything, and I mean everything, was delicious. I will say the mussels were a *major* standout along with the olive oil cake and the patatas bravas. The service was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is dim and cozy. Some may find the restaurant to be a bit loud, but we were still able to carry on a conversation comfortably and the environment felt lively and fun. Can't wait to come back!",

The place is a great Wine Bar, I wasn't too impressed by the food and desert though. At wine bars you're going to have a large selection of wines, and in Barcelona's case...Spanish wines. At the time we visited it was so loud with music and crowds of people, our waitress didn't explain much about the wine list, either because she actually didn't know much about the list or it was too loud.   I think it's neat you can get two different pour amounts ( great for tasting). I also find the ambiance great , great decor, great hangout, great set-up for romantic date if you're into that,  or are  trying to impress someone. It's the bougie spot for when you're feeling bougie. No judgement, just saying :-)",

    "text": "Me and my dude went for the first time on a Friday night, and we'll definitely be back to try more items.  There was about a 20 min wait when we arrived around 6 pm. Not bad at all for a Friday evening. We walked around the neighborhood while we waited. There are lots of shops and other restaurants to walk by while you wait for them to text.  We both like the atmosphere and attention to details with the decor. It's got nice vibes.  Our servers were attentive and really helpful. The only thing I'll say that didn't go perfectly was that we waited a while for my glass of wine while my partner's beer came out first even though I ordered the wine a few minutes before he ordered his beer. Then when his beer came they got mixed up and gave us two beers. We said we ordered one but then they offered us the second as they would just pour it out anyway. When we got the check, we were charged for the second beer even though we didn't order it. That seemed a little unfair to me, but hey we did drink it so... there ya go.  The food was all great. They went above and beyond for me specifically.  I saw here on yelp that it said they had vegan options. When I got there I was hoping the menu would be marked in some way but it wasn't. So I asked our server what vegan options they had and a little while later one of the owners came out with a menu he marked personally with what options were vegan (I'll post a picture for those who want to know). I thought that was really accommodating. If I had a suggestion for them, I would say to go ahead and add a symbol for those dishes on the next menus they print.  My partner ordered:  *Gambas - 7/10 (he said he would like if the shrimp were bigger, but the sauce was really good)  *Beef empanadas - 6/10 (nothing special, but not bad)  *Potato tortilla - 8/10 (didn't expect it to look the way it did... this was really good, just get it)  We shared:  *Squash hummus - 8/10 (if you like hummus, you'll like this; super smooth and a unique flavor)  *Vegetable paella - 7/10 (I thought it was a tad too salty but still really good and worth the wait)  *Broccolini - 8/10 (the sauce they put on it is *great*)  *Spinach-chickpea cazuela - 6/10 (not bad, not outstanding)  ***a 10/10 would be like one of the best things we have ever eaten... for reference.  Overall, for a first experience it was good! I don't mind waiting for things, I understand how it is. And to be fair to the servers, they never left us in the dark. They said a few times, \"We didn't forget about it!\" which makes all the difference to me.  I'm excited to go back and try more tapas and a cocktail! Thanks specifically to Patrick (and wow I'm so sorry if that's not your name, I think it was...?) for marking that menu for me! Very kind.",

Their wine list has such a good mix and it was hard to narrow down the wines I might want. I was interested in either a Pino Noir or Malbec...he suggested a few wine and let me try them! Great start of service!  1st course- We ordered some meats & cheeses from their list along with the truffle bikini which was like a fabulously crafted adult grilled cheese w/ham! HIGHLY RECOMMEND that tapa.  Next up was the grilled broccolini and spiced beef empanadas. Both had nice spice to them and were tasty & great portion sizes.  Last was our main entree.. the chicken pimientos! Now this was recommended by Friday and he said it was the best thing on the menu... Now when service industry people say that it's still either hit or miss but I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE with his suggestion! The chicken was absolutely fire! The inside was moist and super flavorful, the outside was crispy and the sauce was phenomenal. Our mind blown we're blown.   We will 100% be coming back! And hope to link up with Friday again!

Barcelona is great for all types of groups: couples looking for a night out, groups or even solo individuals. The staff is so warm and takes the time to ensure you feel welcome.  The first time we came, we sat at the bar. They have a nice selection of cocktails and huge wine list (it's basically a book). The bartender made a few recommendations based on what I usually drink and provided samples. This was great for someone who doesn't know a ton about wine, especially not enough to navigate a huge wine list.  The second time we went all out with the tapas. They start you off with complimentary bread and oil and we chose six tapas for the two of us. Honestly this was too much; we probably could have gotten away with 4 but wanted to try everything.  The portions are very generous small plates. I've been to some places where the small plate arrived and it is shockingly small. This is NOT the case for Barcelona. I highly recommend the Albondigas (juicy meatballs with red sauce), Brussels sprouts and Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp almost like scampi style) but honestly I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.",

Just when I thought I'd give up and head out, the hostess cane around with a tray of yummy apps for everyone who was still waiting to be seated.  Finally the manager came and got us and after apologizing for the long wait, which was obviously on us, he told our waitress the first drink was on him. We did not hear him say that but found out when we questioned the bill which did not include the drinks we ordered at the table.   Anyway, we ordered the mussels, broccolini, a wonderful piece of fish, and white bean dish and finally a stuffed pepper.  I can't tell you which was my favorite because they were all amazing.  To top it off the bread was crazy delicious.    The vibe is great and definitely on the younger side but that suits these two baby boomers just fine.    Looking forward to bringing friends the next time we go but will be sure to book Barcelona in South End!",

The host told us we could go to the bar and grab a drink while we waited but unfortunately the bar was overcrowded and no option for a drink.  We headed over to the Mexican spot right beside it while we waited for a drink until the host texted us that our table was ready 45 mins later.   Once we got seated our experience went off without a hitch. Our server was fast and friendly, super helpful in explaining the menu since it was our first time.   We both started with wine! So much to chose from! I got a glass of Riesling and my boyfriend got the spicy wine flight. We both enjoyed the wine. We then ordered a bunch of items to share. Albondigas, squash hummus, spiced beef empanadas and grilled hanger steak. I loved the albongias, empanadas and hummus. While my boyfriend was obsessed with the hanger steak.   The atmosphere was very inviting, a little dark but in a good way, comfortable and relaxing. Their bathrooms and waiting area for bathrooms was super rustic and chic.   Afterwards, we decided it will now be one of our top date night places! Highly recommend.",

I feel they fell short, however, as far as the quality/quantity of food you receive for the price. The food was good, but average at best and you would need to order a lot to leave truly satisfied.

Drink service was a little slow to start, not sure really what was going on but not a huge deal as the place is new, and they were already super busy. We ordered a couple different tapas to share. The mussels with the saffron broth---mussels were good but the broth was oh so good. They bring bread to the table. You'll want the bread to dip in the broth. We also had the Cauliflower, the scallops, the Albonidgas (spiced meatballs) and the  Patatas Bravas.  There were probably at least 6 or so more dishes I'd like to also try next time plus they have a really expansive charcuterie and cheese selection. The decor is noteworthy - love the wooden tables. There is also an outdoor patio that I am sure will be popular in the spring and summer.",

I can never say everything taste amazing, but Barcelona knocked it out the park! I want to compliment the service first and foremost, Warren was attentive and had the sweetest gesture. The servers who helped brought the food in a timely manner. I was pleased with the promptness. Lastly I want to compliment the chef and say that every Tapa and dessert was on the MONEY! Definitely worth the 45 min to 1hr wait!  Buen provecho!",

Food and service were AMAZING!! we were told 2-2.5 hour wait but Elizabeth was able to get us seated us early!  Thank you - you made sure we had a great experience and were able To have ample time to enjoy our meal.  Patrick made me the most amazing off the menu cocktail -  DAP Queen.  One of the best cocktails I've had in Charlotte hands down. And Meredith was a great server with really good recommendations according to our dietary restrictions (even with one off the menu item!). Joshua came by twice to see how we were doing and enjoying our meal.  Honestly, even with how packed the place was and it being opening weekend, everything seemed seamless.  They were so attentive, we never had to look or call for service for questions, and the delicious food was soooo worth the wait.  We can't wait to come back with a group of friends to try everything on the menu. Thank you Barcelona for a great date night without our little one.   Olive oil cake and chicken pimento are a must!",

We tried probably 7 or 8 dishes, it's hard to pick a favorite as all of them were amazing.  If I had to pick, I would probably say the bacon wrapped dates and shrimp were stand-outs.  And the empanadas.  And the octopus... Service was amazing - I was worried because there are usually kinks in the first few weeks (or months), but our waiters were very attentive.

I'm a huge foodie, and I was drooling. The crudo was a crowd favorite. That drunken goat cheese was incredible. I highly recommend this place.

    "text": "This review was a long time coming! I went to Barcelona Wine Bar during one of their first weeks open. Of course, it was very busy and long waits, which is expected! I was assured seating after about 1.5 hour wait, which wasn't too bad. However, it took much longer than that to the point where my friends and I decided to go elsewhere. As we were leaving to our Uber, the manager ran after us and asked us to stay. As we had made plans elsewhere, we politely declined, and she told us that next time we try Barcelona, they would have a treat for us. A couple weeks later we decide to give it another try and Barcelona went above and beyond! They had a table ready for us as we walked in - no wait. We asked our server for some vegetarian recommendations and she told us what we could eat. We order some good wine and tried some of the AMAZING tapas. As far as the treat goes - we were served pretty much every single vegetarian dish on the house. On top of that, our wine and drinks too. We were not expecting them to give us all of this (maybe just a dessert or something). I commend a restaurant or bar that goes out of its way to make sure every customer is taken care of. They did not have to give us anything, especially on a busy opening weekend where there are hundreds of patrons. Not only do they have exceptional service, but their wine selection and tapas menu is delicious and well worth it. I've been back every few weeks and it has been consistently great! Well done!",

She seemed busy and a bit flustered trying to keep up.  The ambiance and the energy was fun, the music combined with the open space and number of tables makes for a louder conversation than normal, but nothing to extreme.

I love tapas-style food because you get to try so many options. They did some of the Spanish classics really well, such as the tortilla, the croquetas, and the drool-worthy patatas bravas. The menu also changes with unique dishes, which is fun!  I also thought they had a good wine menu, and I admit to drinking their delicious sangria on the porch one warm afternoon. Speaking of, I really do enjoy their outdoor patio! Definitely a hidden gem that you wouldn't know was there from the outside.",

They have a large bar where you can get drinks and food. They also have a beautiful patio. The kitchen is open, so you can watch the action, depending on where you're seated.   They have a small selection of beer and cocktails, many wines by the glass, and maaaany more wines by the bottle available. They can, of course, work with you to help you figure out what you want.   They have a decent number of options for vegetarians (not really vegans). Their patatas bravas are DELICIOUS and my favorite dish. They always have a roasted veggie option and things like hummus and other dips. And lots and lots of cheese.  The service can be slow because they're so busy but they seem to genuinely care about feedback and service so they're open to feedback!",

    "text": "My experience of this place was very good, however, I knocked off a star because it wasn't what I was expecting.   Atmosphere and decor is fantastic! I think it can get WAY too crowded at nights to where it's not comfortable for a chill wine place but still bearable. We ordered two tapas (empanadas and croquettes) that were excellent and the complimentary bread was delicious! The service was excellent but here's why I'm not rushing to go back:  - I ordered a cheese plate, really not that familiar with cheeses and did not get a normal charcuterie board, but instead just a block of cheese. It's not like going to some of the other wine spots in South End where my $10 can get me some cheese, meats crackers etc. it's a little more upscale cheese and that just wasn't what I was looking for but they happily sent it back and replaced it with something else . If you're into fancy cheeses, you would enjoy it.   -You can order 3oz or 6oz wine glasses and I was shocked. I for sure wasn't only getting 3oz for $6 but I feel like 6oz is pretty standard and the prices were a little high just for 3oz. I did enjoy my wine so no complaints there.  Overall if I'm going out casually to have some wine I wouldn't pick this place but for a more upscale experience, I would recommend!",

We headed next door to superica for a drink and almost immediately got a call that our table was ready. This (and another) call/text from the restaurant were in error, but 45 mins later we were seated and given two free apps by the host for our rouge texts/calls! Additionally, the manager put in two tapas and stopped by our table (super nice)!   We split the squash hummus, artichokes, empanadas, cauliflower, Brussels, and spinach/chickpea dish and enjoyed everything! The wine selections were awesome as well, but I do wish our waitress had been more knowledgeable about the menu for a wine bar.  When we got the check, they had charged us for the apps from the manager and hadn't taken off the other two apps, but they corrected it immediately. Overall really enjoyed the food and wine and want to go back, but service definitely has some kinks to work out. Would I wait 3 hours? (the weekend wait time), no way! I'll probably wait to go again until they take reservations, but overall a great neighborhood spot",

The vibe at Barcelona is both urban and rustic and it's a great location to hang out for a series of small plates and drinks!  The service from Jonathan was great and the food is extremely affordable for what it is. We got the Brussels Sprouts (great char on them), pan tomate, Albondigas (our favorite dish we got - ask for some warm bread to soak up that sauce!), Patatas Bravas (they're lighter than the traditional Spanish dish, which is actually nice!), Ham and Cheese Croquettes, and Bacon Wrapped Dates (the flavor in the bacon is mouth watering). Pairing all of that with a sangria pitcher that poured about 6 glasses around and the check was still only around $80! We were also given a plate of scallops and an extra one of Brussels sprouts that were probably mistakes from the kitchen.  The wine bottle list is also relatively affordable and includes an extensive list of Spanish wines that you probably won't find at many other restaurants in Charlotte. Overall, a great experience that we'll be heading back to in the future to explore more tapas and drinks!",

    "text": "We tried Barcelona wine bar last night, about a week or so after opening. Here were our thoughts:  Service - we had a really great experience here. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We did go at 4:30pm so I can't say how it would be when it was packed.  Mussels - we loved these. I liked the broth especially, and my husband thought they were the best tasting/quality mussels we have had in Charlotte.  Calamari - the breading was light and crisp  Cheese options - loved them!  Brussels - these were delicious. I also loved that they were vegetarian/vegan as most Brussels sprout dishes in restaurants are cooked in some sort of pork.   Cauliflower - I loved the unique sauce on these. My husband felt so so.   Hanger steak - this was our only disappointing part of the meal. The presentation was subpar and the portion size was smaller than we expected. It was delicious but we probably would not order this again.  Beverages - we each tried a cocktail and a wine flight. We loved the idea of a wine flight and enjoyed trying different types of wine. My husband got the gin and tonic cocktail. He was not a fan of it, although a gin and tonic is also his drink of choice and I think he was expecting it to taste differently. I forgot the name of my cocktail (it was the one with grapefruit) and I thought it was delicious.  Overall thoughts of this restaurant - Barcelona is a great addition to South End. The bar looked fun, the food was great, and we had good service. Our only complaint or suggestion to the restaurant is that the 2-seater tables in the back beside the kitchen are super close together to the point where we felt uncomfortable once people were seated on both sides of us. Maybe they should consider removing one of the small tables and spacing the rest out a little bit more. Otherwise we thought it was great!",

I dislike the ridiculous wait times, but I guess that's the price you pay if you want to enjoy an evening of food and drinks in a lively poppin' spot.  Be warned that their food is on the saltier side (or at least that has been my experience with at least 8 of the 10 dishes I've tried there) they have a good menu with a great variety of dishes - everything from charcuterie & gambas to salads and paella, and while I would not say the food is authentic Spanish by any means, it's still decent. The highlight for me however, is the dessert menu! from the olive oil cake to the crepes, everything on there is good.   Definitely a place worth checking out. Put your name on the list, go grab a drink somewhere close by to kill the 2 hours you're going to have to wait (especially if it's a weekend night), and then come back and enjoy a late dinner :)",

A very light, refreshing beverage. We ordered tapas- oysters, scallops and the potato tortilla. The potato tortilla is like a quiche and it's divine. The scallops were perfect with a cauliflower puree. The oysters had bone marrow crumbles on top and we felt that it muted the flavor too much. We also ordered the olive oil cake. I want to have a cake shipped to me weekly. This is like a sweet and salty cornbread cake. You need to eat this cake! Highly recommend this place.

    "text": "Great wine, great tapas and great concept!   First off, I am a  sucker for a place that has good ambiance and decor. This place has it down to the littlest details. It is dimly lit and cozy! Perfect for a wine night to catch up with the girls or a romantic date night.  Second, the wine and food is reasonably priced and good! They also offer wine by smaller ounces so you can try something adventurous without having to commit to a full glass of something less than desirable. We ordered the calamari and scallops to share with a friend and it was delicious. Especially the creamy dipping sauce that came with the calamari! I was even dipping my bread in it!  The only down side, which is I guess a testament to how good the place is, is how busy it is and how long we had to wait! It is good and I definitely plan on coming back but I am hoping that the popularity will die down a little bit so the restaurant is not packed like sardines. I recommend coming at an off time!",

He had a smile on his fave the whole time and I could tell he impacted all of his other customers the same way he did me. I will definitely come back. Thank you so much Sean you are THE BEST.",

    "text": "I love their DC location, so having this gem in Charlotte is giving me all the feels! If you need me this Summer you will probably find me feasting and drinking a bottle of wine on their patio, along with the rest of Charlotte. This place stays packed, so just keep that in mind when making plans. But honestly the people watching here is everything, so the wait may be worth it in ogling lol.  Let's get to the menu, it's a wine bar so their staff is very knowledgeable and can guide you if need be, so don't feel intimidated. The food is designed to share, so don't bring your picky friends, j/k you can bring them. Since no dish is left unflavored, everyone should have something they can't get enough of. And the waiters are pretty savvy about what those dishes are and will recommend you may want two of a certain plate.  Scallops, meatballs and brussel sprouts were all I could fit this visit but I'll be back for more....",

    "text": "Start to finish, decor to dining, everything about Barcelona is intentional and incredible. We arrived around 4:45p on Friday and did not need a reservation. By the time we left around 6:30p, the restaurant was packed. My mom and I ordered a variety of tapas, charcuterie and cheese, paella to share, a pitcher of sangria and flan with coffee to finish. Total with tip came to $140 and we left full to the brim! Our waitress, Elaine, was helpful and gave great suggestions since w where first timers.   I would strongly recommend upgrading to the pitcher of sangria is you plan to drink more than two glasses each. It's a very generous sized pitcher. The calamari are so good you'll want multiple portions if you're sharing with more than two people, the smoky Marcona almonds would be awesome as a snack to go with a beer. We also had the croquettes. - cheesy, crunchy, meaty, potato nuggets with lemon aioli? Yes, please! The more you drink the better these would get! The paella comes with plenty of seafood and could definitely use a bit more rice. The only downside of our whole meal was that it was a bit well done. I like that it had the crust traditionally associated with properly made paella, it just needed a 1/2 cup more soft rice on top. I can't really call this a complaint as I was already so full of delicious and flavorful food at that point in our meal. For dessert we ordered the flan and two espresso drinks. The flan is small and thick with a creme brulee type creaminess. Perfect portion after such a filling meal. Heads up! If you order a cortado, it comes in an espresso sized mug.",

Even luckier, two seats opened at the bar and we grabbed those.  The bartender greeted us right away and got a pitcher of red sangria started.  The sangria was very, very tasty.  We ordered the flank steak, scallops, cauliflower, gambas, albondigas, fabada and redfish a la plancha.  The steak, scallops, gambas and fabada were absolutely outstanding.    The fresh, warm bread was amazing.  The cauliflower was the only thing that was a bit mediocre.    By the time we left, it was standing room only and probably a 2-hour wait.  Get there early or be okay with a wait - it will be worth it!",

The food was also VERY good.  It was late at night so we didn't try a whole lot but we did get the empanadas, Brussels sprouts and the calamari .    There was a TWO HOUR wait at 7pm which was understandable.  we put our name down and then walked over to Common Market and had some \"pre game\" snacks.  I would definitely go earlier than later and would also uber if you don't live in south end.   Sooooo can't wait to go back.  This place is already exploding and it's only been a week!",

We wanted to try everything but we were stuffed! Both of our favorite tapa was the scallop dish. I cannot rant and rave about it enough. The perfectly peppered crunchy searing and how it was cooked to perfection. I'll be back for that alone! We also had the white beans (amazing flavor), the salmon (So, so fresh and delicious) and the croquetas (OMG TO DIE FOR!).  We started with the shishito peppers (I personally like them more on the charred side but these were still a tasty snack) and some meat and cheese. The spicy spreadable salami, sobresata and aged manchego were a phenomenal start to the meal. Even the bread and olive oil they set out for the table is packed full of flavor and executed without flaw.    I honestly can't wait to spend many more evenings on the patio enjoying this culinary jewel. They have a wonderful wine list and I intend to try as many as possible. I can't wait for them to start serving brunch!  As a side note:: they have the most beautiful and clean bathrooms I've seen at a restaurant. They are gorgeous.",

Thank God we called in ahead of time to put down a reservation because if we hadn't, who knows how long we would've had to wait.   Anyways, once we were seated, the service was amazing. Our waitress came over and asked us if we had any dietary restrictions, and since I had a few (allergic to all nuts & vegetarian), she took my menu and crossed out the food items that I wouldn't be able to eat. That was amazing! While she crossed out the items that I wasn't able to eat, it was still tough to find vegetarian items that would fill me up properly. We opted for a few small plates that did eventually fill us up.  For the tapas, we ordered broccoli, asparagus, and one other thing that I just can't remember. Our waiter brought out bread and olive oil for us - this was delicious. I probably enjoyed the bread more than I did the tapas. But, the wines we ordered were insanely delicious as well. We ordered a glass of Cabernet Blend and a glass of Garnacha Blend.   I definitely will come back for wine & cheese, and definitely some warm bread!",

The experience is in line and even better than what I've had at their other location in DC.   If the name didn't give it away, this is a Spanish wine bar/restaurant, so you can find many popular Spanish dishes with a modern twist and a great Spanish wine menu. There are so many sharables to choose from with reasonable prices, and all come out at a good time and spread out enough that you don't feel like you're overwhelmed. If you're going for dinner, 3 tapas is enough to fill up one person, but they're at a good price point and a decent size that you don't break the bank and don't feel over stuffed. They also have entree style dishes, like whole fish and paella! And who doesn't love delicious complimentary bread and oil to start a night off?!  Being in South End, it's a little difficult to find parking and the restaurant can get super crowded pretty quickly at peak times, so make reservations if you can or come a little early.",

    "text": "We'd been wanting to try Barcelona since they opened a couple of months ago, but weren't able to get in on previous tries, as they don't accept reservations (yet), and are very popular.  The Design Center area is hopping now, due to the openings of Superica, Barcelona, Hawker's Street Fare, and Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream.  We finally ventured over early one Saturday evening for dinner, and were able to get seated immediately.  They have an outdoor patio, but it appeared to be mostly uncovered.  Since the sun was very bright, we didn't ask to sit outside.  We were seated near the open kitchen, and enjoyed watching the hustle and efficiency of their staff.  We ordered the artichokes, grilled scallops, octopus, and hanger steak.  We were lucky that the plates were spaced nicely apart in their delivery, as we had a small table with little room for more than one plate.  But since this is a tapas restaurant, you can expect to get the food as soon as it's ready.  They'll give you a delicious basket of bread while you wait with crusty, warm sourdough and olive oil for dipping.  The artichokes were nicely grilled, but I wasn't fond of the sweet sauce that accompanied them, and just ate them without.  They were still seasoned and very good!  Next came the octopus.  It was served coated and deep fried, with a couple of small potatoes.  The seasoning was delicious (although just a tad salty), and the octopus was cooked perfectly.  The scallops came next.  They were cooked through but still fork tender.  They were served on top of a pea puree that had mint in it and was very refreshing.  Finally, the hanger steak was delivered with five small slices, topped with a truffle vinaigrette.  It was cooked rare, so my husband loved it.  I'll bet they would cook it more of you like, but he said it was cooked perfectly for that cut of meat, and it was his favorite dish of the night.  I think I preferred the octopus, but the scallops were a close second.  For our beverages, I had a vodka grapefruit beverage, and my husband had a gimlet.  Both were very good.  Service was exceptional.  There was always someone keeping an eye on our table and clearing off plates when we were done to make room for the next one.   Even with the area's popularity, don't fret about the parking.  Parking is available on the street (if you arrive early), in a lot across from the restaurant, or in the Design Center parking garage just off Worthington.  The garage is $5 on evenings and weekends, and we prefer to park here.   We will most definitely be back!",

I came here last Wednesday night (March 6th '19) with two girlfriends for \"dinner\" (more commonly called tapas & wine here)!   We were seated at a wonderful table JUST next to the open kitchen and ended up with two waitresses (one a trainee)... Everyone seemed to know the menu and wine list quite well!  Almost immediately, a plate of grilled hanger steak with truffle vinaigrette was sat in front of us... we didn't order it... it was complimentary... the chef called it \"kitchen love\"... I'm a fan! :)  We ordered wine and a wine flight for tasting (very clever), and proceeded to order two trays... one with three cheeses, the other with three meats... fresh bread and delicious olive oil was put on the table, and we started to chow...  We realized quickly that the cheeses, meats, and bread were filling us up FAST!  (A rookie mistake, maybe, but I regret NOTHING!).  We ordered croquettes as well (because we had to get ONE other tapa) and some more bread and wine..   I cannot tell you how amazing the food was... just delightful.  But it was more than that.  The experience at Barcelona was a joy.  From seating to wait staff to food to drink and on... we were overjoyed!  To say \"I'll be back\" is an understatement... I CAN'T WAIT to go back! :)",

    "text": "My friends invited me here for an early dinner. Barcelona is difficult to spot from the street unless you're paying close attention.  Everything was delicious. The chef even sent us out extra calamari, which was perfect. My drink was interesting. The Brussels sprouts weren't too charred. Our scallops tasted good, but the portion was small with three medium sized scallops. 5 would be appropriate. Papas had a great sauce. Almost everything comes with an aioli.   Service was great, and everyone was so nice. The food came out quickly. Considering it's a new restaurant, they skipped the growing pains and are running smoothly. On my way out, I saw a fish entree that looked great. I'll be back to go beyond tapas and have a full dinner.",

    "text": "OK - it's taken me wayyyyy to long to write this review, but I was here opening week and it didn't disappoint! Even opening week the service was impeccable. I sat at the bar and had the most phenomenal service. The bartenders were brought in from other Barcelona restaurants to assist with opening week (genius idea) and this was obvious because they knew what they were doing / recommending! Since then, I've been back four times and haven't been disappointed!   The only downside is the wait/bar seats. It's always a long wait and 3-4 people deep at the bar. TIP: If you come here, don't be upset with people who stand behind you at the bar. I had some women upset with me for standing behind them.....when the line was 4-5 people deep. Seriously?? Enjoy life and just drink your wine, at least you're seated! :)   Definitely come here for a date night or girls night out if you haven't been. Cheers!",

    "text": "Welcome to Charlotte, Barcelona! I originally went to Barcelona when visiting DC and was completely blown away! Had the pleasure of dining with the Southend location twice now since it's opening, and both times were with a group of 10+ foodies! I have to say the first time was a bit underwhelming, but tonight is swaying me a bit closer to the dark side! With a table of 11, the attentiveness of the staff was absolutely incredible! It was so great that I really wish I caught the name of our sweet waitress!   This is really a 3.5 star review and it's not because Barcelona isn't great, it's because I've had some amazing tapas in my lifetime. At this point, I'm pretty sure I've tried 90% of the dishes so below are a list of the best, the good and the not so great:  Best - Lamb Pintxos (perfect flavor and texture)  - Scallops (just melts in your mouth!) - Patatas Bravas (that sauceee! I could live in this!) - Oysters (perfect blend of textures and subtle flavors. Dish came with 3 and I so wanted more!) - Potato Tortilla (light, fluffy perfection) - Jamon y Manchego Coqueta (can you really go wrong with croquettes?) - Sangria (I've tried both the red and white and you really can't go wrong!)  Good - Littleneck clams - Mussels  - Mushrooms a la Plancha (seriously, how do you make mushrooms taste so delicious?!) - Albondigas (meatballs.. not my favorite but def a table favorite!) - Cauliflower a la Plancha (that sauceeee) - Paella (for a place named after Barcelona, the paella should be out of this world.. and it's not, but it's decent)  Not so great - Red Snapper Crudo (extremely fishy and not very original compared to the other dishes.  - Eggplant Caponata (not terrible, not great. We had lots of this dish left over)  Dessert Our waitress was kind enough to let us try all of the desserts in honor of the birthday girl! We ordered most of the menu and as you can imagine, was completely stuffed! Let's just say we made room for all of the below and would probably eat another round if it landed in front of us. Loved everything! - Flan (literally the best flan I've ever had. Would count this as a fooe group if I could)  - Olive Oil Cake (surprisingly amazing! - Cheesecake (devineeee)  Thank you for such a memorable experience, Barcelona.",

The restaurant was so full of people.   No matter what part of the restaurant you were in, people were coming out of the woodwork.  We were seated in the back and it was so loud that the server had a difficult time making herself heard.  We started with the sangria. I had the red because I was intrigued that it had guava juice in it.  I will admit, it went down fast!  The tapas started coming fairly quickly.  We had the spinach and chick peas, okra and corn, Mahon cheese and bread, veggie paella, and a chicken dish served in a yummy sauce with some thinly sliced potatoes.  It was all very good.  The atmosphere was electric.  Maybe a bit too electric for my digestion!  This is a place suited so well for millennials. We felt OLD, as the twenty and thirties crowd dominated the space.  Did I mention there were lots of them?  Good food, though I am not a fan of small plates. I prefer having a big plate of food in a quiet atmosphere.  I guess that's just the old in me.",

We grabbed some cocktails from the bar and went outside to sit at a community table while we waited. Our cocktails were incredible and we were even brought some bread to munch on! The patio area is BEAUTIFUL and before we knew it our table was ready.  The food here is out of this world. The friends I ate here with studied abroad in Spain in college and they were freaking out because they said this is the first time they've found a restaurant in America that compared to what they ate when they were there. We shared a bunch of tapas including the patatas bravas, brussles sprouts, and mushrooms a la plancha. I was full after sharing two small plates with the table and two small plates with my boyfriend.   There is a sommelier that walks around the restaurant and helps you pair drinks with your food (which is incredibly helpful when the wine list has nearly 400 wines). He suggested a dessert wine pairing with the flan that we can't stop talking about. I can't explain why but it was one of the best things I've ever had. This restaurant is an incredible South End addition, we are already planning our next trip back!",

Checked BWB and they had an open table! The vibe is chill, the hostesses were super friendly, our waitress Aeverie was over the top awesome.  We ordered some Spanish and Portuguese wines and a variety of tapas plates. The hangar steak w truffle was out of this world and our favorite dish for sure. Meatballs were juicy, the Brussels had just the right amount of char but still tender.  We mentioned it was our anniversary and they ended our meal with a complimentary champagne and sorbet treat. We weren't expecting that at all. The Crunkleton didn't even acknowledge the special occasion and it was noted on our reservation. Barcelona is hands down our new date night spot. Can't wait to go back and try the rest!",

    "text": "Just opened and already a new favorite!  I tend to not visit places right when they open to allow them to get out the opening jitters. However, I really wanted to check this place out. We were blown away!!!   The location is excellent. We can walk here from our house, which I'm pretty pumped about. But also, the atmosphere is beautiful. I love all the woodwork in the bar.   We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted and helped. I decided to try the red sangria, which is made in house, and I loved it. Definitely one of the top ones I've had in town. My husband got a glass of wine, and we enjoyed the wine selection as well. I was hesitant to try a cocktail as this is a wine bar, but I did and loved my drink. It was the spice rack.   They provide you with bread that is made in house and olive oil. It's delicious. We began to order tapas. It comes out when it's done, which I love. We had the albondigas (meatballs), croquettes, brussel sprouts, hangar steak with truffle aioli, and oysters from what they call \"the box.\" They've got a wood fired oven they use for a few dishes, and they call it \"the box.\"  We enjoyed all of our dishes, and they didn't feel too overpriced.   They also had a very nice selection of meats and cheeses. A bit expensive if you want a full board, but still a good option.   They also have more substantial meals, like paella, that can be shared between two. We didn't try this, but I'd be curious to in the future. Costs more, but it seems like it'd be a nice portion.   We took the olive oil cake home. It was a large piece. I loved it, but my husband felt it was a bit savory with the salt.   The best part was the service! We asked a lot of questions, and Josh answered all of our questions with confidence. He could describe every wine, every meat, every cheese, and every cocktail. He was very attentive and so pleasant. He's here from Boston assisting with the opening. I'm sad he won't be here permanently, but if he's training the staff, we have great things to look forward to.",

You can request to sit on the patio for outside dining.  Cocktails are amazing and probably my favorite part of my dining experience. They let us sample the white and red sangria which was a tad too sweet for me. However, my friend ordered the Guns and Roses sangria and it was fantastic! Only complaint on the seasonal cocktail I tried were the amount of seeds from the jalapenos. There were so many I contemplated getting a spoon to scoop them out. The bourbon cocktail was light and refreshing. My friend doesn't enjoy bourbon and actually ordered it after trying mine.  As for food, the best thing I tried was the scallops! They had a little heat to them but were good all the same.",

We waited about 1.5-2hours for a table but it went by super quickly as we grabbed drinks from the bar and weren't in a huge rush. The Gm Josh told us that they will have a reservation system in a few wee. The bar was well staffed to handle the influx of people that were waiting for a table.  We got a great variety from the meat and cheese plate and I've tried something different each time I've gone and haven't been disappointed. Huge fan of the lomo and 9-Month Aged Manchego.  On the tapas side, I highly recommend the grilled flank steak, patatas bravas, and Albondigas (meatballs).  Lastly, get the olive oil cake with vanilla ice cream! Absolutely delicious.  All in all, this was an amazing experience and I am happy Charlotte has a place with this atmosphere, drinks, and food. I now understand why the wait was so long because not only are the foods & drink delicious, but you don't want to leave because you are having so much fun.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place out and finally made it on Sunday for a girls night.  Luckily at 6 pm on Sunday we got seated almost right away.  I was nervous because I had heard of 2 hour waits on Friday.   Here's my thoughts on the overall experience: Ambiance - the restaurant has a cool vibe and I liked the decor, my only comment is the music seemed just a tab loud. I can appreciate some music, but I like to hold a conversation at a normal level.   Drinks - they had a decent list of cocktails to choose from but our waitress wasn't too up to speed on these.  I did love how you can make your own wine flight, that is a plus although a tad pricey.  Overall great selection of wines.  Food - was decent overall. I was surprised by the cheese & charcuterie, as it wasn't served with any crackers or anything else, just cheese and meat. Also it appeared none of our dishes were served with serving utensils. Had to cut through the thicker cheese with a butter knife and used our forks to serve all of our other dishes.  We also tried the Brussels which were good and well cooked, the bacon wrapped dates which were also pretty good.  The croquettes were decent and the beats were pretty good as well.  Nothing stood out as being amazing however.   Overall a decent experience, but if you have more than a glass of wine, the bill can add up quickly without realizing it!",

I came here to celebrate an engagement recently and it was the perfect night. We were seated outside, and while the lights and decor are cute, it is August in the south. The heat (no fans outside) was the only downfall.   We were with a group and did the $35 deal.. which is a steal! TONS of food and the server picked which saved us the whole discussion of what everyone wanted and didn't want. It made the entire evening stressless and everything we had was incredible.   The food was to die for, but the service was what really brought it home. Asha -- I know im butchering the spelling-- you made all of our dreams come True. And Jaime, couldn't forget you, Jaime. Friendly, attentive, personable, accommodating and helpful. They knew the menu forward and backwards, brought out the most amazing things and made the whole evening amazing. I requested to add jalapenos to the Paloma (delicious by the way) and the first was perfect. the 2nd drink came with 1 million jalapeno seeds which made it so, so spicy. I wasn't planning on saying anything, especially because I asked to add jalapenos, but as soon as Asha saw the drink sitting on the table (someone else brought it out) she immediately apologized, got me a new drink and the bartender even brought it out herself. The remade drink was perfect. It was obvious it was a simple oversight and their recovery was amazing.   I can't stress enough how accommodating the entire staff was. It made the night filled with good drinks, and amazing food that much better.",

    "text": "Id say 3.5 to 4 honestly. First the place has a nice feel to it, and the service was REALLY good! Our server took extra time to explain things to anyone who had questions and even helped my mother in law pick out a wine that suited her tastes (which she ended up loving and ordering a second glass). And she even comp'd us a dessert (the olive oil cake which was really yummy!) As far as food we got the following: bacon wrapped dates, drunken goat cheese, red snapper crudo, calamari, scallops, octopus, potato tortilla, albondigas, croquetas, patatas bravas, pork pintxos. Nothing was bad at all, but not much stood out either. I would say the two things that stood out to me the most ( had the most flavor) were the pork pintxos and the octopus. The two things i thought were skippable were the drunken goat cheese and the crudo, neither had any real flavor. The rest of everything was yummy but nothing id rush back for. Overall it was a fun outing with a group because tapas are always fun imo.",

    "text": "Came with family for an early Saturday dinner. I'll start with the reservation process, which I have to say was a little odd and annoying. First of all, they're not on Open Table and didn't answer the first time I called. Secondly, even though I called 5 days ahead of time, there were no reservations available between 5:00 and 9:45. Thirdly (and strangest of all), I got a confirmation phone call the day before and then 2 different confirmation texts the day of. I clearly indicated over the phone and on the first text that we would be keeping the reservation. Anyway, not a big deal but definitely the most over-the-top reservation confirmation process I've ever experienced.  Now on to the food. The 6 of us shared about a dozen different tapas and although there were some standouts, there were too many mediocre dishes to warrant 5 stars. My favorites were the Pork Pintxos, Patatas Bravas, Croquetas, and Bacon-Wrapped Dates. The pork had the perfect char and heat level. It was universally loved at our table. I'm not usually a big fan of potatoes, but I kept going back for more of the Patatas Bravas. So much so that I had to skip the last couple dishes altogether. The biggest disappointments were the Drunken Goat Cheese, Potato Tortilla, and Red Snapper Crudo.  The ambiance and service were both top notch. The waitress humored my father with his dad jokes and even brought us a complimentary slice of olive oil cake for dessert. Overall a pretty solid restaurant but not quite as good as I hoped.",

Their cocktails are amazing - a pitcher of sangria is perfect for sharing and so reasonably priced. My favorite of their tapas are the meatballs, the whipped cheese, the ham and truffle sandwich, the croquets, the bacon wrapped dates, and so many more!   This place is intimate - think small tables and close proximity to other guests. It's also fairly noisy, so keep this in mind if you're wanting to have a private, quiet conversation.   Your going to want to make a reservation if you don't want to wait. This place is awesome and I'm so glad it's in my neighborhood!!",

    "text": "Okay guys some friends of ours brought us here for anniversary and i have to say this place is worth the wait, on the weekends be ready to wait for at least one hour until there is a table ready for you BUT its worth it. From the host to the team of Barcelona they are great at what they do.   Kasey was our server and she was on it, the food we had was amazing and she made great suggestions, the ladies had a Rose sangria that it was amazing, our choices that night was the following: tapas, TWO orders of empanadas, the asparagus and the mussels for the entre we had the seafood paella. Everything was amazing. One tip keep the mussels broth and dip the bread in it. Kasey will keep filling up that bread basket  They offer you still and sparkling water which to my opinion is awesome. My wife and i were celebrating our 19th year anniversary and the whole staff presented my wife with a Barcelona book with everyone's signature and we got a special note from Kasey our server. Honestly this was a great surprise to us and we loved it. They also gave us a dessert sample which included the following: Olive oil cake, flourless chocolate cake and a flan.   I have to say this has been one of the best experiences i have had in a restaurant, you can tell everyone in this restaurant loves what they do. I will definitely be coming back to this place.   Thanks guys!!",

I read the place can get busy, so I recommend making reservations. Our server was very friendly and helpful. I just wish the restaurant wasn't so loud. One of my friends could barely hear our server when she spoke.   We were given the blowfish as compliments from the chef.  We also ordered the seafood paella, patates braves, calamari, and truffle bikini.  The seafood paella was slightly bland and a little overcooked.  The rest of the food was good, especially the potatoes!  I wish the menu was more descriptive. Each tapas simply lists the ingredients. For example, I didn't know a bikini was a sandwich, I simply knew it contained truffle, jamon, garlic aoli in the dish. It would be nice if the menu was a little more detailed in that regard.",

Our server and her assistant server were awesome.   We ordered two drinks and 3 tapas and our bill was about $50 so it wasn't unreasonable. We ordered meatballs, hanger steak and croquettes which were all really yummy.

I made a 7:45pm reservation on a Wed. and still had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table - mid-week. We got a delicious cocktail at the bar while we waited. A word on those cocktails, wine felt like a better value here. The cocktail pours were in a small glass and the glass was 1/2 to 3/4 full for both cocktails we ordered.  Once seated we were brought warm bread and complimentary sparkling water. Jamie was our waiter and he had timing, charm, everything. He made me a custom wine flight based on my taste and ordered it from lightest to most complex. We ordered and our initial food came right out. Then a thunderstorm hit and we waited and waited and waited. I saw the manager on duty carrying tables into the dining room from the courtyard and holding umbrellas for guests in her business clothes, with a smile.  Jamie lept into action bringing us complimentary items and dessert. He salvaged what could have been a night spent listening to my husband's stomach growl and instead we left very happy. The food here is great and there are vegetarian options. Come with people you like as you have to get close to hear them. Next time we'll sit in the courtyard.",

It's impossible to have a real conversation in these kinds of places that try too hard to make it a nightclub environment.  87db according to a typical iPhone app (db Level Pro).  People at tables on either side of us were literally screaming in order to be heard by their own table.    Service was excellent.  Outstanding, actually.  Food is good.  The fancier the house water, which is allegedly triple distilled, the cleaner the glasses should be.  Menu items need more detail like what has onions or what kind of cheese.  Wish they wouldn't put the garlic aoli under every dish, especially the croquettes and sandwiches.  It's like they just put it there as glue to keep food stuck to the plates for the food runners.  It doesn't serve any other purpose for dishes that are supposed to be crispy.  Bathrooms are single use which is ridiculous in a place this busy.  In 30 seconds in bathroom 3 people rattled the door handle.  I'm sure they couldn't even hear me shout, \"Be right out!\"    Bartenders pouring shots directly from the bottle into people's mouths in the middle of the tables?  Really?  At a restaurant at 9pm.  Reminds me of Ru San's which is also a tacky clubby nightmare.  But you don't find that out until you actually get here.  Not for me...",

I went for a friend's birthday dinner, and they sat the 5 of us at a table on the small outdoor patio. Fair warning, we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table on a Friday night, but it was well worth it! Per other reviews, the outside area is noisy and the music is pretty loud, but it didn't detract from the experience in my opinion.   The servers were super nice, and they were very helpful in explaining the Spanish tapas style! We ordered the patas bravas, the asparagus, and the fish. The food comes out on a rolling basis (in True tapas style), so feel free to order throughout the course of your meal.   Pro tip, they gave us a free dessert for my friend's birthday. If you do pick a dessert, I highly recommend the olive oil cake. It was absolutely delicious!",

The staff passed a few appetizers which was really appreciated since the food smelled fantastic. My friend checked on the wait after tow and half hours and was told it would be 15 minutes. At three hours she checked again with the same answer. Three and a half hours later... and hour and a half after we were initially told two hours we were sat. Had we been initially told three and a half we could have easily gone for a walk since the entire restaurant was jam packed and loud. Had we been told another hour after our first ask we also could have gotten another drink; we both waiting assuming we could just order at the table.   The food was fantastic!

From the drinks to dessert everything was AAAAMMMAAAZZZIINNNGGG. We had a charcuterie board that was fabulous. It had so much variety and hadn't had such good cheese and charcuterie in Charlotte that it took me back to Madrid.   My favorite small plate by far is the patatas bravas. They are so good I wanted to lick the plate lol. The spiced beef empanadas are fabulous too. If you want to add some veggies to your meal get the grilled asparagus, broccollini, and the shishito peppers. These were some of my favorite greens. Don't hesitate in ordering the pork belly it was SO GOODDD. The mussels are fantastic. Save  some one the bread that they bring at the beginning and dip it in the mussel sauce. It is fabulous.   Their drinks are really good and reasonable prices. The wine list is really nice and they have a good variety of different wines depending on your preference. I normally get a glass of the Grenache and it pairs really well with the food taste.   The interior decoration is gorgeous. I love how they decorated the place. It's a little loud since it's always packed, so you might need to speak a little louder.   The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star review is because it takes a while to get a table. We waited 2 hours for this meal, so hopefully they get this reduced.",

    "text": "Mood: Date night, romantic, outdoor dining, AND great patio with a pup. The yelp page says no dogs but they are allowed on the outside patio!  What to order: as odd as this is, I have to start with dessert because they were literally our favorite dishes. Olive oil cake is probably one of my favorite desserts I have had in recent memory. So moist, so good!!! Also we had the chocolate cake, very delicious too. On the other dishes - we liked the trout and the jamon. Shrimp were good but not spicy enough. Meatballs were good but not amazing. Tomato salad is not good enough to order again. Pulpo or octopus was great! Drinks were very good too but a little small. We got the two whiskey / bourbon drinks and a glass of wine each.   Other considerations: the service was slow and there were some spots where we had no idea what was happening. It was Friday night at 7 but just an FYI. We were there for 2+ hours.   Price point: somewhat expensive. We got a fair amount of food and the bill was around 140 with tip.  UPDATE: so the above still stands BUT my husband and I both woke up in the middle of the night, sick to our stomachs. Ek! We may only be going back for drinks and dessert :( feels like it could have been food poisoning!",

    "text": "One may assume Barcelona Wine Bar is yet another average Spanish tapas restaurant but that would be a terrible mistake!  My wife and I wandered in with our co-workers and friends early on a Friday, and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff and the rustic wooden interior. The restaurant was - surprisingly - already occupied by several patrons by 4:00pm.  We ordered the mussels, the truffle bikini, the crispy calamari, the gambas al ajillo, the dotted snapper crudo, the roasted baba ganoush, the albondigas, and the jamon & manchego croquettas. While nearly everything was excellent - I would pass on the calamari - there was one dish that stood out among the rest.   The truffle bikini was quiet the juxtaposition of familiar and new experiences. On one hand, it reminded me of a grilled cheese sandwhich my parents would fix for me. On the other, it included the robust flavor of ham, truffle and cheeses with which I am not familiar.  The prices are appropriate, the menu is diverse. I would recommend this as a great restaurant for groups or a casual date night.",

We were seated right away, but unfortunately no one came to help us for like 15 minutes. They were very apologetic about it though and brought us a complementary charcuterie board to make up for it!   Overall our service was great after that little mishap. They were all incredibly friendly and offered great recommendations.   We ordered a bunch of tapas and shared them. We tried the mussels, the truffle bikini, the crispy calamari, the gambas al ajillo, the dotted snapper crudo, the roasted baba ganoush, the albondigas, and the jamon & manchego croquettas.  Everything was really good. My favorites were probably the truffle bikini, shrimp (gambas), and the croquettas, but it was all delicious. The calamari was really the only thing that didn't stand out to me.   Their complementary bread was delicious and they will bring you as much as you want to use with the extra sauce from what you order.   I would definitely come back to try more! They also give you a free tapa token if you fill out their survey card at the end!",

    "text": "Always a great experience! I cannot rave about this place enough. We have been about 5 times now and it is the perfect place to have a girls night or date night.   From the moment you walk in to the moment you pay, the service is top notch. I love tapa style restaurants because you can order as you go and they understand that you just want to take your time, eating and drinking.   When ordering, here are some must haves: Albondigas  (meatballs -best thing on the menu), potatoes braves(they remind me of home fry style potatoes), Gambia's Al Ajillo (Shrimp Dish), Hanger Steak, Potato Tortilla, Red Snapper Crudo (ceviche), and the Spiced Beef Empanadas. I also suggest getting the Sangria Pitcher, it's great to share with friends or a date. One thing I love about their menu is that they change the menu every month with new specials from the chef so you can always get something new.   A couple of tips: if you are ordering for one, order 2 or 3 tapas. If you are ordering for 2, order about 4 to 5 tapas to share. All of the sauces that come on the tapas/plates are great when you dunk their beer into. The items lower on the menu take longer to prepare so they will come out slower than the items closer to the top of the menu. All plates come out at different times depending on when they are ready. They do take reservations so I highly suggest calling so you don't have to wait long.  Eat, Drink, & Relax!",

However, I love Barcelona for the service! The service is superb and the servers are always accommodating. On our most recent visit, we had to wait a bit longer than normal for an 8:30 pm reservation. We were meeting for a friend's celebration. To accommodate our inconvenience and enhance the celebration, they provided complimentary tapas and champagne.   If that wasn't enough, they also provided us with our favorite server, Elaine, who is a badass in her own right! It was absolutely superb.   A number of the guests in our party were first timers...now they will become repeat customers because Barcelona is everything you desire and more.",

    "text": "Spoiler alert: I wasn't that impressed.  Visited during the Art & Soul Southend street festival a little after 5 p.m. on a Saturday and was able to walk in and get a table. We were told that there was a long wait for the patio but, after spending most of the day outside, we were okay with an inside table.  The one and only shining part of the Barcelona experience was our waiter, Farmer. He was funny, took time to go over the menu and wine list, and was just a good time.  I came in craving a spicy margarita. I took the time to look over their menu and saw margaritas are not on their list but I asked because they have a bar and I figured why not? I was told they could do it and looked forward to my spicy marg. Unfortunately, it was not spicy at all. I took a whiff and it smelled spicy but there was not one ounce of heat from the jalapenos floating around in the drink. I guess that's what I get for ordering a margarita at a wine bar. As for the alcoholic options actually present on the menu, they do provide wine and champagne flights.  Okay, so the food. We ordered: The albondigas (meatballs) Calamari Patatas bravas Baba ghanoush  Out of the four, my favorite was the calamari with the albondigas a close second. The calamari was light and would pair very well with a crisp sauvignon blanc. Overall, personally, the food just wasn't up there for a tapas bar. I've had a lot better at other places.  This is definitely a place to people watch and be seen. Keep your expectations low when it comes to the food.",

One of the managers David followed us outside to let us know he could get us drinks and a spot on the patio to wait so we thought about it and headed back in. He grabbed Brian the bartender who got us awesome drinks immediately and then treated us as soon as we walked out to the table with some snacks on the house for choosing to come back in. What spectacular service!! Scott the bar manager stopped by to thank us and let us know it was their 8th day open. They are killing it!! As a restaurant manager myself the display of hospitality was outstanding and only enhanced the entire experience when we had some of the food alongside. Thank you for making our first night in Charlotte a great one guys!!",

We waited  two and a half hours for a table but enjoyed drinks from a server and the atmosphere while we waited. Very friendly staff who were all working to make a good impression on guests. When we got our table we ordered some tapas, octopus, hummus, and some other things I don't remember exactly what they were and for the main course we ordered paella. This place has the best paella I have ever had! It was so tasty and delicious. The food came out quickly and it was all warm and fresh. We loved the European feel of the restaurant and will definitely be back! My only complaint is that wine is expensive here, it was $12 for a 6oz Riesling which is pricey compared to other places. (Mickey & Mooch gives 8oz glasses of Riesling for $6 and it is a high end restaurant) Not a place to go for a drink alone but definitely worth the food!   The manager also stopped over a couple of times to check on us, seemed like a great guy who really cared about our experience!  We will be back!",

I struggled a little bit at first with the menu items; however, a quick Google search will tell you what you need to know about the selection.  The restaurant is cozy, a little tight with table space, but nothing that I couldn't get over.  The ambiance was nice and the dinner experience was just very satisfying.  I would definitely visit this restaurant again.",

Shoutout to Patrick!! Potentially front of house manager? He approached us when we first walked in and we were clearly waiting to get a drink. He made a point of asking us if we needed any recommendations and went around the bar himself to get our samples. He continued to serve us while the restaurant was extremely busy!   Ah-mazing.

    "text": "These guys are killing it. My wife and I popped in on a Thursday night visit to Charlotte, and they were slammed busy. My wife and I both manage restaurants in Asheville, so we were understanding of the 1.5 hour wait time for a table, but just thought maybe we'd come back another time. Noticing us leave, David ran outside to stop us. He let us know there was an outdoor patio with a little more seating space, and it was all self service so we could casually have a drink out there. He was so nice to do that for just a random couple in a sea of paying customers, we were impressed.   But it didn't stop there. Not only did David get us back in the door, but with just a look, he got one of his bartenders, Brian, to come out from around the bar of customers 2-deep, and take our drink order personally with a hand shake and an introduction. Brian then proceeded to make our drinks and get our tab started and closed in record time. I had the Whiskey Root cocktail and my wife had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, both delicious. We went from impressed to wowed.   But it still wasn't over. We made our way to the outdoor patio with our drinks, and David was already out there clearing off a table for us. After sitting down he brought us a complimentary snack of bread, olive oil (sooooo good), whole olives, spiced nuts, and eggplant. This had really done it. At this point it had seriously been less than 10 minutes since we had decided to pass and move on to another place, and now we were sitting at a table, with drinks and food, feeling like royalty.   Let me be clear, the drinks, food, and atmosphere were all top notch... but the service was out of this world! Like I said, my wife and I are both restaurant managers in Asheville, and we were really blown away. Barcelona Wine Bar was an incredible piece of our night and our visit to Charlotte. We will definitely be back, and all of our friends will be hearing about this place from us for sure!",

I arrive promptly at 6:55 to check in for our 7pm reservation . The hostess mentioned that when the majority of my party arrived we would be seated . I would say everyone was there no later then 7:15 ..we didn't get seated till 7:34, granted the health inspector dropped a surprise visit to the restaurant and was using our table to hook his laptop up and do what he needed to do . (Understood ....I assume that's why we received on the house a basket of calamari for the wait..much appreciated). The food was good , everything I had from beef empanadas (my fav...also the oysters were  ) to blowfish with salsa verde was quite tasty and cooked right . I will be honest and say the food is not filling though. I would say don't go there expecting to leave stuff unless you purchase their paella. My drink Lucy B was decent, I didn't finish it but it wasn't terrible . Maybe my palette with the food I was eating and drink just didn't mix right to me. The ambience of the place is beautiful , from the structure to the decor ...very rustic and new age",

Very cool vibe and service was fast (we walked in without reservations at 5 on a Saturday, but it seemed to fill up quickly after that ... service deteriorated a bit as they got busy).  I would say the food was adequate. The hanger steak was a bit off (it's hard to describe, but I felt it should be less work to chew); I'm also not a fan of the truffle vinaigrette that accompanied it. It sounds like these should go together, but after trying it, I would have preferred something else. In general, the pairings didn't seem to compliment each other. The potato tortilla was a bit bland, but had some nuanced flavors. I would have liked a sauce that brought out these flavors. Instead the chive sour cream brought out the blandness (the taste of sour cream overwhelmed any other flavor). We also tried the Spinach-Chickpea Cazuela and the Trumpet a la Plancha (at the suggestion of the waitress). The chickpea dish was bland in my opinion and the Trumpet (i.e. mushroom) dish was underwhelming and smaller than I would have expected (it was by far the smallest of the dishes we ordered). Also, I totally understand the tapas style menu - but felt that there just wasn't enough on the plate to constitute a meal.   The Guns & Roses sangria was great. The menu rotates and there are many other dished to try, so we will certainly give it another shot (plus I'd love another glass of the sangria).",

    "text": "BEYOND disappointed in the service. Came here for my boyfriends birthday with a large party. They wouldn't seat us until everyone was there (understandable) once our party was there we waited AN HOUR to get an answer of when we will be seated. I get your busy but we made reservations a month prior. Not that it's acceptable for the staff to be rude but for the manager, omg this is why I will never go back. The manager was a flat out asshole- he had attitude, was rude and didn't care to make the situation better. He actually told us we could leave if we wanted  SMH",

I often dine at tapas style restaurants so I can taste a little of everything but not really impressed here. Only three protein choices and the cane out cold which was kind of annoying. The hostesses and servers were great though, very polite and quick.",

    "text": "One of the best tapas restaurants I've been to - in the US or elsewhere. In fairness, I've never had tapas in Spain, so that might be an issue for some.   The Brussels sprouts were incredible. Perfectly crispy and tasty. The artichokes were tender and perfectly seasoned.  The mussels were also really tender (even though I don't like mussels, usually). And the hangar steak?  It was as though God himself cut those pieces of meat, seasoned them, and placed them upon my tongue.   Have I mentioned the paella?  Probably not, because it was so good I was put into some kind of trance.    Our server was amazing. It was an incredible experience. Thank you!!!",

    "text": "Amazing food! All our selections were awesome, definitely better with a group so you can all take a bite of each tapas. The wine menu was also reasonable - varieties of wines and prices. The service was by far excellent. The waitress Elaine was friendly, helpful and efficient. You definitely need a reservation, wait times for people without was about 2-3 hours on Saturday peak. They take reservations on their website. Super easy to do! So happy and can't wait to go back!!",
