I asked for cheese dip (queso) when we sat down and ordered our drinks. It never showed up. I think the waitress forgot because it wasn't on the bill either.  The inside dining room is SMALL. As you can see from pictures that others have posted, there is also an outside portico for dining outside when the weather is nice.  Tonight it was windy and threatening rain so we didn't have that as a choice.  The location is nothing to write home about but the kitchen turns out very edible food.  Having lived in the southwest for 5 years, it doesn't measure up to what I got out in TX, AZ, etc. but by Charlotte standards, it's fantastic.  I had the Chicken Coco Loco. It was tasty!  My dining mate had stuffed pablano peppers. He cleaned his plate.  I wish I had seen the Thursday special before I ordered! I would have enjoyed that too... \"Special Burritos\".  For families, remember the space is constrained. I would not bring a rambunctious kid here. Your neighboring diners will be ready to strangle you and the kid.",

The place is not much bigger than a double wide trailer (not counting the large covered patio) but what they lack in size and decor they more than make up in food and drinks. The food is plentiful and tasty and their lunch menu is just the right size. Speaking of lunch, if you get there right as they are opening (11am-ish) you can get in, eat, and get out in under 30 minutes. Not a lot of places can say that. Oh, and did I mention the margaritas are huge and outstanding!!",

    "text": "I remember the first time I ate here. It was near my best friend's home, and a huge group of us went one day. I wasn't an adventurous eater then, so I ordered something that looked pretty tame. I had the nacho cheese burritos, with chicken. That was in 2001 and for the past 12 years I have ordered the same thing every time I visit.   There is a short list of \"must visit\" places every time we go home, and Miguel's is #1 on that list. When you pull into their gravel parking lot, look past the outside of the building and it's location. When you get inside, look past the decor & the cracked, red vinyl booths. Take a seat (there is no host/hostess, just sit where you want), dive in to the chips and salsa (I could eat their salsa with a spoon!) and get ready to enjoy a truly delicious meal.   This visit Graham & I both began our meal with a margarita. We were heading to a movie after dinner, so I got a small one. If you're not going to sit through a three hour, really depressing musical (Les Miserables... really good, though) order a pitcher. They had them on special that night and it the pitcher was cheaper than what we spent on the drinks we ordered. Graham thought his was weak, and ordered an extra shot of tequila, I thought mine was perfect.   We devoured two baskets of chips and salsa while waiting for our meal. Finally, it arrived. We were starving, and of course this was the one time that the service was slow. But our food came out and it was worth the wait. I know the burritos don't look like much... but oh baby.  The cheese sauce is absolutely delicious, and the inside of the burrito is stuffed with huge chunks of chicken, bell peppers, tomatoes & onions. Every single bite is delicious. I was craving some black beans too, so I ordered a dish on the side. Black beans are usually pretty bland at most restaurants, and these were too. But a spoonful of the delicious salsa and some salt worked wonders.   Graham is a little more diverse in his meal selections than I am. I find something I like, and I tend to stick with it. He typically gets something different each time. This time he ordered the Enchiladas De Chorizo. This was excellent. The chorizo was perfectly cooked and really flavorful.   Miguel's is truly on my list of my favorite restaurants of all time. The food is delicious, the service is quick and the staff is always pleasant. The same people have worked there forever, and back when I still lived in Charlotte and ate there every week, my server would bring me a sweet tea without even asking. And the price absolutely can not be beat. Dinner, margaritas & tip cost us about $42.   Three enchiladas filled with Mexican sausage, covered with shredded cheddar cheese & green sauce. Served with rice, lettuce & pico de gallo.",

To my disappointment that melted blob was my \"chili relleno\".  By most definitions (and the fact that I worked as a prep cook in A Mexican restaurant), a chili relleno is a pepper stuffed with cheese and various other things.  The gent on the phone said the recipe varies in Mexico, but I disagree because of the word CHILE on the menu!  The gent told me he would make it right and I appreciate that, but please take the word \"chile\" off the menu description. Extra star for them offering to make it right.",

So when we drove up and saw Miguel's was nestled in the shadow of an interstate entrance ramp and was attached to a run down motel, I was like, \"I bet this food is about to be awesome.\" Now it's *possible* this is a more enjoyable dining experience when the weather is nice and you can sit at one of the tables beneath the patio breezeway. However, since it was cold and rainy, we had to sit inside, where the dining room is smaller than my living room and kitchen. The tables were so crammed together, our chairs were literally up against the chairs of the people behind us. As you can imagine, there was also no space in the room for the sound of voices to travel, so we spent the duration of our dinner yelling across the table. The service was slow, though the people at our table who ordered margaritas got them almost immediately while everyone who ordered waters had to wait almost 15 minutes to receive them. Always rubs me wrong when waiters are more than happy to deliver drinks you'll have to pay for, but not the free water. Even in spite of all that, I still would've left in good spirits had the food been satisfactory. I am not exaggerating when I say, I would've preferred Taco Bell. The standard items were fine and about what you get anywhere (rice, refried beans, queso). But the ground beef was disgusting, the sauces tasted like grocery store brand, and the generous quantity of food we received (for reasonable prices) could not save the poor quality.  We went here because it seemed to be a good halfway meeting point for dinner with the in laws. We will never return, even if it means one of us driving an extra 20 minutes to eat somewhere decent. Maybe even Taco Bell.",

And the portions were a good enough size to get you full. The menu prices were affordable and the dessert is super cheap yet so good. It's a small place but don't let it fool you the food was authentic Mexican. I had the \"Tequeno Dorados\" I believe",

As a self proclaimed Mexican fanatic I was excited to see just what this place had to offer.   We started with the chips and salsa and they were classic. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of kick!   My friends and I ordered a little bit of everything...fajitas, shrimp quesadillas, tacos, rice and beans.   Everything was delicious...and the portion sizes were perfect! Add to that good service and super reasonable prices! I'm absolutely coming back.",

    "text": "I'm so sad to say that we had a terrible experience at our first trips to Miguel's. Firstly, I will admit that we went on Cinco de Mayo, so I understand that it was crowded and crazy. However, it was so disappointing that a Mexican restaurant could be so incredibly underprepared on a night when they know lots of customers would be coming.   Firstly, we were not greeted at all. In fact, when we walked in, it was so crowded and there was nowhere to stand, but there was no one to direct us or let us know how to get a table. Eventually, we decided to sit outside, and I believe we sat ourselves. A waitress came to get our drink orders, and those came out fine. Our waiter then switched. We ordered some queso and our entrees, while we ate chips. Eventually the chips ran out and we asked for more. The chips never came and neither did our queso appetizer.   Finally (after a VERY long time -- meanwhile, no drink refills or anything), our entrees come out. The food was mediocre. It was clearly cooked in a rushed manner...unfortunately, it was just like blobs on a plate.   Our waiter was so inattentive and everything felt so chaotic. We did not feel welcomed.  When the waiter came to give us our checks, we asked him if he could remove the queso since we never received it. All he said was \"I already took it off\" with no apology. We are fairly certain that, had we not mentioned it, he never would have acknowledged that we did not receive it.   Needless to say, we will not be returning. Even if there is hope for a less crowded experience. The hunt for a great Mexican restaurant continues.",

    "text": "Really delicious Mexican food! Granted the building looks sketchy from the outside, but the inside is clean and inviting. They have a great outdoor covered space which would be great to enjoy margaritas.   The shredded beef tacos were great. Usually tacos are smothered with sour cream, lettuce, and other filler that takes away from the meat, but not this place. The shredded beef was cooked to perfection and topped with the right amount of lettuce and shredded cheese. Not that gross yellow cheese, but the delicious white cheese that they use for quesadillas. Yum. However I do suggest if you order these for take-out you ask them to put the items separately so you can build-your-own when you get home. It was only a 5 minute drive from the restaurant back to my hotel room, and in that short amount of time, the hard taco shells had become soggy from the beef juices. Kind of a bummer.  I also got the shrimp fajitas. Lots of shrimp and brightly colored veggies, which they didn't cook to death like most Mexican places. It was also a nice surprise to see some zucchini mixed in there along with traditional fajita vegetables. Bummer though that they forgot to give me the tortillias, so they weren't really eaten as fajitas. The rice and beans side was okay, I wish the Mexican rice would have been a bit more interesting. It was definitely an afterthought. Their guacamole isn't fresh, but instead an overly smooth dip. Maybe I'm spoiled from recently visiting Mexico, but I didn't care for it.  Overall I would absolutely recommend going here especially if you have an overnight layover. If I could give it 4.5 stars I would, but I stuck with 4 stars because it's not quite 5.",

The refried beans are almost puree. The chips come out warm and the salsa is fresh but once again, almost seems pureed (a chunkier, more homestyle would be better).    The tacos were really good. But the enchiladas seemed odd. The sauce was brown instead of reddish like I'd expected and there was no cheese on top at all. The tortilla seemed like it had  been fixed for awhile. The soapapilla dessert was tasty.    Overall, the meal was a mixed bag. Blackened anything (fish, etc.) here is excellent though.",

We were worried that Yelpers may have lead us a stray. As ramshackle as the bldg. is,  the location is only 3-4 minutes from the airport's car rental return & near gas stations for you to refill. Now on to the food:  We were immediately served with warm tortilla chips and delicious house salsa. Pureed salsa that was mild with a hint of heat. Very good. Ordered a side of guac. It did have real avocado but it seemed mixed with something & was a little runny. Not the way I like quac but it might be good to others.    The chix. enchilada was fantastic. Tender tasty chix & lots of it along with a couple of onions & bell peppers. It wasn't slathered in sauce either and the sauce was yummy. Highly recommend.   The ground beef taco was good but paled in comparison to the enchilada (in our order we had 2).  Also had the chili relleno. Very unusual. Almost a Con Queso dip. The chili was chopped and mixed in with a  meet & cheese mixture. It was served next to the beens & it was almost the same color & consistency. Once we figured out it was the chili relleno, we devoured it. I ate it on a chip with some house salsa. yum. I would definitely recommend it but would ask them to use less cheese if I ordered it again.   Also had a beef tamale. There was a little shredded beef inside, but mostly it was the tamale breading with a ground beef & sauce mixture pored over it. My husband enjoyed it, but for me it wasn't as good as the relleno or enchilada so I only had a bite.  As a San Diegan who has access to excellent Mexican food on a daily basis, I would say the food here could go head to head with some of San Diego's Mexican restaurants.    Our bill was $22 with tip for all that food plus a soda- much better price, value and taste than anything you'll eat in the airport. If you have time, highly recommend pulling over here instead of a quick bite at the airport.  I am writing this review in the airport about an hour after finishing our meal & I still have a very very full stomach.",

Pricing is very reasonable and the food is good.  The service, although not the friendliest, was solid and my server checked on me often.  I was in and out in about 35 minutes, but didn't feel rushed.  Overall, I would recommend Miguel's for someone looking for a Mexican food alternative to the national chains.",

HOWEVER, just because they don't spend their hard earned cash on decorum, doesn't mean that they don't keep this place clean.  I am not a neat freak, but I was pleasently surprised/satisfied with the cleanliness of this place.  So don't worry about coming hear for sanitary reasons.  As for the most important part - the food.  The food is delicious - classic authentic mexican - can't go wrong here.  It's also outrageously cheap.  I was hear on my company's dime so it didn't matter.  I went all out and the bill still came to under $10 for lunch.  Enjoy!",

The service is just fine and attentive, I've not experienced any customer service issues here.  They have combos and affordable food if you want something cheap; otherwise there big entrees are good and still not a wallet buster.  I'd recommend this place to anyone on the west side or anyone making the trip South on I-85.",

I have never had anything like this, and there have been bad ones. Maybe it's an east coast thing. We were referred by many people claiming this place was great. I'm convinced those people have no taste buds, and have never had authentic Mexican food. Very disappointed!!!

I ordered the chicken soup with was delicious. The broth had wonderful flavor and the ingredients were all fresh and flavorful. It was a nice lite lunch (there was a menu full of more filling options). Everything on the menu looked delicious. I'll be adding Miguel's to my list whenever I am making a lunchtime airport trip!  There is easy parking but it is a bit of a loop around the major roads so I'd recommend using GPS the first time you go.",

Besides the retried beans that were filled inside the tacos, I didn't get any extra in the side like I'm accustomed to with he other Mexican restaurant I frequent. I honestly wish I could've had another taco instead of two made it three with some extra re fried beans on the side. I also ordered some guacamole, the consistency wasn't to my liking, almost a little thin. Like it wasn't prepared fresh. Anyway because the shrimp tacos were good, I would definitely order from them with postmates again.

Miguel's is comparable to most in Lone Star State. Had the Mango margarita and husband had regular on rocks. Mango was very good.  Meal began with chips and salsa. Did not have the heat but was okay. Shrimp fajitas were good with zucchini, mushroom, squash, bell peppers.  The rice was good but wish there had been more guacamole. Husband had enchiladas Verdes. There was a heaping amount of chicken in the three. We took two sopaipilla back to hotel.  Thank goodness we had refrigerator with freezer. Yum two large containers of vanilla ice cream. Half time ball game deserts!",

    "text": "Not sure why this place is so highly rated. Stopped here for a quick dinner on the way to the airport and got burritos tipicos and enchiladas supreme. Food was straightforward and not much thought given to presentation, which is usually ok by me if the flavor wows. But the flavors were just ok, mostly salty.   The burritos were piping hot and cheesy and satisfying without being overly complex. They came with a pool of salty refried beaks and a side of shredded iceberg with a dollop of overly salty guac billed together as \"guacamole salad.\" The enchiladas were barely warm and covered not with gooey cheesy sauce as usual, but with shredded lettuce and sour cream, which made everything soggy and cold.   The menu is huge so perhaps other items are much tastier but what's the point of a huge menu if you can't do all the items well? In sum, I've had much better Mexican even at this price point but I guess if you have to grab a bite in this area you could do worse than this place. The open breezeway seating is a bonus, as you can watch planes come in for landing close overhead.",

Since it was a mexican place i did order 1 taco, I had to and glad i did. The people I was with had a pitcher of margarita also which they said was strong but good. For dinner I had the shrimp in garlic sauce which was delicious, a must try. One person though in my party did order the steak and cheese burrito which is not what she got.  We did not complain though, the waitress seemed like she really didnt want to be working that night.

I don't know if it was the owner or not but saw him refill someone's chip basket with his bare hands.  While the other ladies wore gloves while filling the chip basket. That was a no no on his part.

I'm all for dive bars and restaurants but this place, located on what looks like a forgotten access road, had me saying, \"no no no...\" as I pulled in; I couldn't decide which was worse - the restaurant or the derelict motel next to it.  I was just about to pull out and figure out a plan B when I decided to throw in the park and take another look at the reviews; the restaurant received four out of five stars from nearly 100 diners, many of whom acknowledged that potential customers shouldn't let the aesthetics scare them off.  So glad I trusted these 100 strangers...what an amazing, flavorful meal! If I lived in Charlotte, I would be a regular.   My only bit of criticism is that I thought the staff could've been a little warmer but, hey, when your food is this good, you know people are going to come back.",

Though the outdoor patio-esque area looked fun...However for a snowy NC dat, we sat inside.   We were immediately presented with menus and chips and salsa. We ordered the Speedy Gonzalez (special for the day for $4.50), Chili Relleno, and the chicken soup. Also got two dos equis drafts....Excellent price at $2.50!   The ranchero sauce on the enchilada was perfection. I also loved the refried beans. However the chicken soup was the winner for me. Great broth flavor and loaded down with chicken and rice. Exactly what I needed on a cold day.   I think our bill ended up being around $20 for everything. This place is the real deal and quite possibly jumped to my second favorite Mexican joint in the city!",

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that the service is not great at all. Barely even good.

Needless to say, the price was right and the food lived up to the expectations.  We got here early for lunch on a Saturday. We started off with $2.50 dos equis draft, speedy gonzales, chili relleno, and chicken soup. The whole meal capped out around $20 and was more than enough food for the two of us. The big winner for me was the chicken soup on this particularly cold day. It was loaded down with a ton of fresh ingredients and the flavor was awesome. I would certainly venture back out here again for lunch.  We got there right when they opened, but I have heard this place can get busy. Also they have a neat outdoor space that I would like to try when it is warmer sometime!",

    "text": "I don't know why I never reviewed Miguel's until now. A True hole in the wall Mexican restaurant and I mean that in a good way 'cause the wife and I love places like this. Went Tuesday 1-22 to celebrate the wife's b-day with the daughter and granddaughter. This was the daughters first ever visit and she said she could not wait to come again. This is some of the best and most authentic Mexican food around and is worth a 30 minute drive from our house. One suggestion anything that comes with ground beef such as tacos, burritos ect, pay the 75 cents up charge and get them with shredded beef instead it will make them soooo much better. Everyone enjoyed their meals and service was very good. They brought extra chips with the cheese dip, checked on us often and promptly cleared empty plates.  Tried the flan on this visit even though we were stuffed and it was very good. Prices are reasonable with most combos running $8-9.  For the 4 of us including our meals, cheese dip, flan, drinks, tax and tip we got out for $38 which I thought was a great deal. One tip be careful because its on the I-85 service road. You turn off of Little Rock road between 2 gas stations onto the service road and you can easily miss it and if you do you will end up on I-85 south. At that point you will have to go all the way to next exit which could be in bumper to bumper traffic and make your way back to Little Rock road again which could add another 30 minutes to your trip especially if you get caught in rush hour traffic. This place is not fancy and like I said its a hole in the wall or dive, but that's generally were you can find some really good food and that's what you will find here at Miguel's",

If you haven't come here for lunch...you probably won't...but it is worth noting that two people can get in and out for under $10 total (with chips and salsa) by getting the daily special.

I like Miguel's, the service is quick...no banter...just order, eat, get up and pay...leave. I've never been here outside of lunch since I'm not driving 30 minutes to grab Mexican.

No warm smiles. We were pointed, not taken, to a table. Their horchata is really good. The complimentary salsa and chips were also very good, with a bit of a kick. The waiter took our order which was a fajita taco salad and a regular taco salad. Both were good, but the fajita one was better. The only problem was I didn't realize that it came with guacamole. I usually ask about it, but I didn't see it mentioned on the menu so I forgot. Avocado gives me a gag reflex so I had to eat around it.   Not sure if we'll ever come back, only because of the location...but if we find ourselves on that side of town, I wouldn't object to a visit.",

Covered booths with open air windows.   My suggestion for this place would be the fajitas, something difficult to screw up. The re fried beans leave much to be desired, they are soupy and bland. I have only had a few different entrees here, usually opting for the tacos or burritos when looking for a quick cheap lunch.   Miguel's was hard to find on my first trip there, you see it through the woods driving down Little Rock Rd. but the entrance is no where in site, not to mention once you do find it it's a little confusing being attached to a hole-in-the-wall motel next door.",

The taquitos (flautas, really) I had were simple, full of meat, and delicious. If your idea of Mexican is fajitas in Dallas, you won't like the place.",

First off...I really should have gps'ed the address because this place off the beaten path...or maybe too beaten. It's actually on an I-85 service road nestled between a chain hotel and an old motel. I must say I was a wee bit concerned when I got out of the car. But it was all good when I got inside.  I ordered the Quesadilla Rellino (sp) and a side order of guacamole. Of course the guac came out first and maybe its because I make a mean guacamole but this was a watered down avocado mousse with very little seasoning. I had to ask for a lime and shake some s&p before I could convince myself to eat it. Not okay!! My quesadilla however was awesome!! The chicken was seasoned so perfectly, I really could have eaten buckets of it. Overall, I will definitely try this place again san guacamole.",

    "text": "As other Yelpers have mentioned, ambience is not a priority here. In fact, the outside felt a little like the Bates Motel!   However, the food is quite tasty and not expensive. I enjoy the taco combo with pulled beef, rice and beans.  My companion has tried the chicken taco salad, fajitas, burritos and enchiladas.  We have always found our food to be very yummy.  I've been here a dozen times and always see the same people working. They are also very generous with the chips and salsa, and they pour a biiiig ol' soda, which I appreciate-I hate to have to continually wave down a server for a refill when the soda comes in small glasses.  It can get busy, and I love to see all the different kinds of people willing to jam into this little space to eat some good Mexican food!",

    "text": "My experience is not a reflection of the whole place.   I visited this place with my wife on a whim. I had heard about this place from a customer of mine and decided while we were in the neighborhood to try it out.  I knew this place was a hole in the wall type place which my wife and I enjoy. They have a small diner like interior with optional seating outside. My wife and I decided to sit outside.   We both went inside first to make sure we were doing the right thing and I spoke with a waitress and she asked us how many and then told us to have a seat anywhere. I said we would be outside.  We sat outside and was soon brought out chips and salsa. A minute later two Hispanic construction workers sat next to us outside, one of them went inside while the other sat down. Two minutes later a white couple did the same thing we did(go inside and then sit outside).   The couple who arrived after both pairs were brought chips and salsa, menus and was asked what they would like to drink. Meanwhile my wife and I and the construction workers had just chips and salsa.  Then a waiter came out and asked for drinks from the construction workers. At this point my wife was quite upset as we sat before both of the other tables. When the other tables waiter came we asked for at least menus and he said \"oh your waiter is coming\". Both my wife and I have worked in food services and my wife was a waitress and expressed concern that if a customer ask for a menu, no matter your section or not, you bring a menu.  Then one of the construction workers noticed that he hadn't seen anyone visit our table and asked if we had ordered already. We stated that we hadn't. And he said to us \"that's wrong, they are getting waited on before both of us(pointing to the white couple).  At this point my wife was ready to go. I said let's wait one more minute. At this point a waitress went to the construction workers table and we decided to leave.   We didn't get to experience any of the food outside of the chips and salsa which was good/average.   It was a horrible experience but one that is not uncommon for AA restaurant patrons.",

As soon as we  set down a woman flew by dropped chips and salsa on the table so fast that chips came flying out of the basket.  Are waiter came over and took our order. Meals came out fast and arrived well below my expectations!  My friend had  chimichanga  and I had the lunch stir-fry, as I don't eat meat I asked for mushrooms there was not a mushroom to be found.  I've visited this establishment twice before it was three years ago and I am 99% sure that I had a different experience because after this one I will not be back.  Next time I decide to have Mexican I will take the  seven minutes drive to Taxco  Mexican Grill!",

Atmosphere offers off the beaten path food experience melding old school diner and Bordertown Mexican.   Grab a chrome stool at the counter/bar or slip into a red leather booth and dig your way through authentic south of the border cuisine while checking out the wall decor. The building is interestingly quirky- open-air outside dining room roofed but likely too hot unless there is a nice breeze. Inside for the dining room or full bar. I went ala carte with a beef taco, chicken quesadilla, and chicken tostada (so hard to find good tostadas; the chicken was perfect blend of chunks and pulled - no gristle).   Great service coupled with great location adjacent Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Oh, and the prices are ridiculously low. Try something different and check it out!!!

We fed our family of 3 a big lunch for what it costs to buy a meal ar McDonald's.  Will definitely remember this place on our next trip through the Queen City.  If only we could've had one of their margaritas!!",

It is definitely my husband's and my favorite \"dive\" Mexican spot. It's absolutely no frills, but the food is cheap (and tasty) and the beer is cold!   There are combination platters to try a little of everything, which is what I did, but there's also specialities and deals of the day. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but I definitely recommend starting with either the guacamole or the scream cheese! It's definitely a gem in the rough in the charlotte food scene that's worth a nibble or two!",

The very first time I was brought here, by my best friend, I expected to be disappointed. Simply for the fact that it is so run down. It is a very small building with limited seating. They also have tables outside. But I'm a loyal customer now. They staff is friendly. The food comes out hot AND delicious (EVERY SINGLE TIME). They make a bomb mango margarita. My best friend and I call this \"our spot\". About a month ago, the boo was in town and he pulled up Miguels without my suggestion. He asked me about the place and without hesitation I said, \"Let's go!\" He was also impressed by this place. You definitely CANNOT go wrong here. Much love to all the wonderful people who work here and create such great food!! And of course, I'll be back!!",

I would not come here if you are looking for good authentic Mexican food and a friendly atmosphere. Go to Pacos Tacos instead, better food & service for the same price.

I ordered fajitas, supposedly a signature dish.  Brought the beans, rice, and fixings one minute, 10 minutes later the tortillas, and 15 minutes later the fajitas.  Tortillas and fixings were cold by then.  The fajitas didn't even have fajita seasoning on them so I dumped my salsa on top to add something to give them flavor.

From the outside, at a quick glance, it does not seem to be a restaurant, although it does have a covered outdoor seating area. We walked in, looked around, seemed like the place could seat around 50 people inside. They do serve beer wine and liquor. Without looking at the menu, I asked our waiter (as he was serving us chips and salsa), if they had pork burritos. He said they did offer \"Serrana Burritos dinner.\" I ordered it. The chips and salsa are fairly standard in taste, not a lot of spice in the salsa. The burritos came with Mexican Rice. The pork was really flavorful, and also inside was sauteed green peppers and onions . And the sauce on top, though I cannot describe it, was a nice bonus. This place had a lot of character.

Miguel's is quite small but it does boast a nice-sized outdoor enclosed patio. The inside does not have A/C, at least it didn't on the day I visited which was a warm day. A basket of chips and salsa are provided - for free - while you take the time to go through their large menu. I decided to go with chicken fajitas and a glass of white sangria.  The white sangria legitimately tasted like Moscato. There were no fruit pieces in the glass. Again, no frills and it was $3.75. The chicken fajitas were served the typical way on a sizzling skillet, with mushrooms and squash in addition to the normal peppers and onions. Tortillas served on the side along with a scoop of pico and rice and beans.  The waitress didn't seem particularly thrilled or interested in to be providing service but it is what it is. I can't say I'd rush back here but it was decent food at a low cost.",

The sign isn't very vibrant, so be careful you don't miss it and don't judge a book by it's somewhat off-putting cover. There is nothing fancy about the appearance of Miguel's, but they do offer outside seating in a covered area which is great in sunny weather.  Complimentary chips and salsa were good - I'm a salt feign, so I was craving more, but really these were good as is.   We both ordered the Sunday drink special: Half Pitchers of Margarita for $8.99. What a great deal! Drinks came out quickly and tasted great.   Miguel's offers a large menu with plenty of options, I chose the dinner special - Chicken fajita's with rice and beans for $8.99. Again, the food came out quickly. It was served on a sizzling skillet with warm tortillas on the side. Chicken was cooked well, the veggies (onions, green pepper, mushroom and tomato) were grilled and seasoned well. Service overall was okay and food was great.",

I'm from the Texas area and use to a certain kind of Mexican food that I have not found in the Charlotte area and the way they described the food sounded exactly like what I love, was use to, and was looking for.   The restaurant is in a bit of a strange location and is quite rough around the edges. The staff is generally annoyed with everything. BUT the food is amazing and a great price. First, chips and salsa are included which is for some reason, so rare in charlotte. The salsa is perfect and not too spicy. It's what I grew up eating and I was so happy to taste it here! The rice and beans were perfect, creamy regrows beans with Mexican, orange rice. The tacos were so good, with that finely ground beef with cogito cheese sprinkled heavily on top. The beef burrito was so satisfying, it's ground beef, rolled in a tortilla with cogito cheese on top with red sauce. RED SAUCE. For some reason read sauce doesn't make an appearance at charlotte Mexican restaurants and it breaks my heart. But Miguel's knows what they're doing and has the perfect recipe for it.   I had a margarita as well, it wasn't amazing, definitely not fresh lime juice, but it was cheap and worth it.",

The digs are not fancy, so don't get too excited. They are fast, friendly, and inexpensive.   I'd like to see fresh chips - that's the secret sauce, err, salsa of the best Mexican joints. That would be a great upgrade. The large beer is no joke... be ready to drink. Also, the hard shell tacos would be far better if the corn tortillas were fried up, but so it goes.",

This delay was a little odd, but I got over it.  I ordered from the specials board, an arroz con pollo. It didn't take long and it was brought to me. A very good portion, plenty of grilled onions and peppers and chicken and, for some reason, mushrooms. It worked though, especially the sliced avocado.  Inexpensive meal, even with a Corona. I'd go back here for sure.  Miguel's is really, really close to the entrance to the Charlotte airport. It's not fancy.",

You should definitely know what to expect before coming here. It's not fancy and it's definitely a hope in the wall. There were a few people there when we got there, but we were seated right away.   They start you off with complimentary chips and salsa. They weren't there best I've had, but after a long day outside, they hit the spot.   I got the enchiladas de chorizo. I enjoyed them, but I thought it was missing something. For enchiladas they seemed plain. My two friends got the fajitas special and my husband got the chorripollo. They all loved what they got.   Unfortunately, the service was pretty bad. When we got our food, the fajitas were missing all of the toppings they were supposed to come with. By the time we could get someone's attention and they bright it out, we were almost done eating. Then when we went to the counter to pay, we must have waited 15 minutes for them to help us. It definitely seemed like they were short staffed.   I would come back here again and would recommend checking it out if you're a fan of whole in the wall, authentic, Mexican restaurants.",

When we tried to order our drinks she was inching away while we tried to order, she only came back to give us our food or something, she never once talked to us and the men waiters (2) ran into me and my two young children two times with no sorry or excuse me..   Honestly I have no idea how this place has 4 star or why we were told it was amazing food (by two families)  My husband wishes we just spent the $30 at Taco Bell  we should have gone to on the border instead!  Also I forgot we ordered some margaritas and mine didn't even taste like it had alcohol in it...   -WILL NEVER RETURN-",

It was somewhat crowded on a Tuesday but I got a seat at the bar. Service was sorta slow although I was in no hurry. The salsa had the consistency of ketchup and was not all that great. The michelada was OK, had better. I had a bowl of the Azteca soup that was pretty decent and then got a enchilada/taco combo plate which arrived at the same time as the soup. The enchiladas and taco were uninspiring to me. Sorta bland. Everything had this plain ground beef in it. Was not my favorite Mexican joint.",

Miguel's is definitely off the beaten path: it's about two miles from the airport off Little Rock Road on the service road. It doesn't look like much. It's small random house next to the Wingate Hotel. They have a cool outdoor covered seating area as well.   They have $4.25 lunch specials every day. On Sundays, there's a $4.99 fajitas lunch specials. They also have drinks specials every night as well as dinner specials that start as low as $5.99. Don't mind me, I'm the girl who gets a lunch chimichanga AND a chile relleno on the side (while consuming an entire basket of chips).   Note: Chips and salsa are free if you are dining in, there is a charge for to-go orders. It's worth it, the salsa is homemade and delicious.   They do take credit cards. The place is small, so take that into consideration when making lunch or dinner plans. Tonya and I went yesterday at 11:30am and it was the perfect time.",

The hound beef on the tostada was absolutely delicious. It tasted like it had marinated all day in a broth. Very, very good...and I'm NOT a meat person. I have a feeling I will be craving this place again soon.  One start off for the waitresses was not happy or friendly at all.  Maybe she was busy, I don't know, but I wished she would've been nicer.

The restaurant itself was dirty hot and smelly.  The wait staff was rude and acted like they were pissed that we showed up.  We ended up eating outside and the table was filthy. My order was wrong, I asked for soft tacos and got crunchy.  The shrimp that my wife ordered were so over cooked they were almost black and completely dry, not to mention they weren't deveined, gross. We had six people in our party and everyone's dinner came out in rounds, about five minutes apart and the kids got theirs last. When we finally had enough we  asked for the check. About five minutes after that the drinks that we had ordered halfway through dinner finally showed up, but we decided not to drink them.  We had to chase down the rudest server on the planet to pay for our horrible dinner and I've never been so glad to leave a restaurant my entire life. Everything about it was terrible. Do not go there. Even if the hotel that you're staying at recommends them, don't fall for it.",

When you drive up it looks condemned, it's on 85 Interstate Service Rd, (exit 32 Little Rock Rd) that right there, sounds sketchy.  It's beside a closed motel, (Bates Motel reference).  This alone makes me LOVE this restaurant.  It is everything you want it to be in that off the beaten path kind of way.  They don't serve the best food, the margarita is average, service is functional, but all of it wrapped up it's like heaven.",

The beef is always cooked to perfection: a little bite and firmness, then falls apart in slow-cooked strings in the mouth. The chimichanga is always golden brown and not oily at all. Classic white cheese sauce on top,and flavorful beans and \"guacamole salad\" on the side.  Arroz Con Pollo and Chicken soup are very flavorful and satisfying as well. Green chile chicken is delicious too.Nice gravel parking lot, scenic views of 85 and the Tuckaseegee/Little Rock intersection. What more could you ask for?",

I speak Spanish and even speaking in Spanish didn't help.   The chimichangas were average and the chicken soft tacos were so salty, I couldn't taste anything else.   Come on Miguel, salt is a flavor enhancer that should bring out and enhance the flavors, not completely over power them.   The out door seating is in an enclosed space that has no windows, just cut outs.  It was so hot and uncomfortable.   They need fans to get the air moving in there.

This was 5 min from my airport hotel.   The chimichangas had moist, tender chicken with onions and peppers. The tortillas had a nice delicate crunch and savor under a generous helping of guacamole and sour cream. The refried beans were earthy. And the chips and salsa were as everyone says - great.  Nothing I like more than a local hole in the wall with yummy good. Great value too. Service was a bit indifferent for me - otherwise the food is 5 stars.",

And I think that's why we continue to frequent it. In general, the food is just okay. Maybe I haven't found the right thing to order yet but in getting the chicken/shrimp fajitas and a couple of the combos, I've been underwhelmed. The margaritas are cheap but I agree with other reviewers in that they're incredibly light on the alcohol. The food is cheap-ish overall but the portions are much smaller than other Mexican places I have visited (we've left hungry a couple of times even after destroying chips and salsa AND our entrees). The wait staff is incredibly unfriendly but not to the point that it is a major deterrent. The hubs and I like sitting outside to eat but beware: the booths and tables outside are at best disgusting.   I hate to say it but we will probably continue going to Miguel's purely because of the food desert we live in. Not sure I'd recommend it to any of my friends, however.",

We had 6 in our group and we all liked what we had. Started with their special dip, with ground beef and queso, it was yummy and good sized. I ordered the lunch chicken fajitas for $6.95 with a side of sliced avocado for  $1. There wasn't that much chicken but it was actually the perfect amount for 2 good sized tortillas to fill! It came with the usual grilled onions and bell peppers but also grilled squash, zucchini and tomatoes with a side of beans, rice, sour cream and pico. They did serve alcohol but non of us had any. Also you can ask for hot sauces! Overall it was excellent and I'd definitely go again if I'm in town!",

The servers are courteous, but tend to work fast and you tend to have multiple people waiting on you, so you don't really get attached to any particular one... One guy brought us the complimentary chips and salsa (which was delicious! The chips were hot and perfectly salted.  The salsa tasted fresh with a really nice kick to it.).  A lady came to take our drink orders and brought them back to take orders and a different guy brought our food out... All of them were nice, but I have no idea what their names are...   The margaritas are definitely worth a taste, if that's your thing... The medium is the size of a Presidente from Chili's, for comparision's sake...  So the large is an investment... lol    They have a number of specials for lunch and dinner... My favorite is the beef burrito with rice and beans... It's perfect for a light lunch, but still filling...  So, I'ma go ahead and tell you: this place looks sketch as hell, but put that aside... This is one of those things about not judging a book and blah, blah... The inside is clean, the food is super tasty, the specials are great, they sell old school penny candy at the register and the drinks are good... What more do you want?",

I arrived a little before 12 and the place was already crowded and by 12:30 every table was full. The servers were friendly and chips and salsa arrived immediately upon being seated. Although the salsa was a little smooth for my taste it had great flavor and the chips were good too! The fajitas arrived fresh and steaming, they were served with tortillas, sour cream, pico, and rice and beans. I chose the chicken, with included onions, peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini, and a great portion size...especially for the price.   Even though the look of the restaurant is not what you would expect, it is worth a visit..and I know I will be back on Sunday when I have a fajita craving :-).",

Not going to lie, probably the best salsa I have had, certainly in recent memory. Absolutely delicious and the chips were great too. The place looks right out of a 60's diner with bar stools and red vinyl booths but don't let the dated decor fool you. Played it safe with a combo fajita platter. Everything was seasoned to perfection. The steak may have been left on the grill a tad long but it all tasted phenomenal. The portions weren't huge which was actually refreshing. Coming from the guy who eats everything in front of him it was a pleasant surprise. I left fully satisfied but not over stuffed and that was with two helpings of chips and salsa. The service was stellar. Didn't have to ask for refills - or anything for that matter- they just came quickly. The prices are more than reasonable for the food and quality. All in All a great experience!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.",

What they ARE about, however, is excellent non-chain Mexican food at a fantastic price.  Food:  The tortilla chips are mad fresh.  Yum.  Salsa is milder with great flavor and smooth texture.  Double yum.  I had the steak fajitas - it was a tremendous amount of food for one person.  Did I mention the fantastic price?  Paired that with a draft Dos Equis and called it a meal.  Service:  All business.  Seating occurred quickly with minimal interaction - they aren't interested in doling out the feel goods.  They want you to order quickly and accurately - this can be challenging as the menu is quite extensive.  I read the other interviews and didn't even try for a drink refill; just ordered a huge beer to tide me over instead.",

The salsa was also kickin' (mild!), although I think the chips were bland. I also splurged and got a fried ice cream, even though I was stuffed... Big mistake , but it was tasty.   I would give 3.5 stars, but it's not an option.",

Salsa is great, smooth and spicy! Chips were stale, even when we sent our basket back and asked for a fresh batch.   Tacos and nachos featured more stale chips/tortillas & watery queso.   Basically, the star is for the quiet outdoor seating and quick delivery of food to the table. But overall, don't bother with this hole-in-the-wall.",

When you walk in, you feel like you're walking in to someone's home kitchen. There is a choice of indoor or outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is in a little open air structure, so you are still out of the elements if it's raining or if the sun is beating down in the summertime. The menu has a lot to offer, I usually get tacos and rice and beans, while my fella usually gets jalapeno poppers and a veggie quesadilla. There are also American choices on the menu. Portion sizes are generous. The police in the area seem to really like eating here, there is almost always an officer dining when we go there. That tells me 3 things, Miguel's treats our officers right, the food is really good and a good value, and I will be safe eating at this establishment. Service is always friendly. I wish Miguel's would come to Raleigh.",

    "text": "This is another in a long list of  \"Thank the flying spaghetti monster for Yelp!\"  I was flying back from Memphis and got stranded at the airport in Charlotte for the night due to bad weather in NY.  I grabbed a cheap hotel near the airport, took their shuttle bus and ended up  in the middle of some place I knew nothing about.  What to do for dinner?  Well, that's easy, let's open yelp and find something within a reasonable walking distance.  This place pops up as one of the best within a walking distance.  I would have never seen it without Yelp.  It is almost part of a little motel, tucked away in the backside of some parking lot.  I actually walked by it before turning back around and finally finding it.  They have a nice little covered outside seating area. . .and the weather was beautiful down there so I took advantage.  A little noisy because it is almost on the highway, but the weather more than made up for the noise.  The inside looks a lot like a typical American Diner, which was a bit weird, but I don't care much for decor if the food is good.  The menu was a standard and basic Mexican food menu.  I am a big fan of Carnitas and it is always hard to find decent Carnitas in the chex-mex dominated \"mexican\" food places around my place in queens. . . so I was immediately drawn to that dish.  It was absolutely great.  Nothing special or fancy, but the meat was well cooked (and cooked right which isn't always the case).  The guacamole that came with it was fresh and tasty.  The tortillas were perfectly fine and all of the trimmings were fresh and of good quality.  I then ordered a beer, she asked if I wanted a large and I said yes. . .who am I to blow against the wind?  And this thing was monstrous.  We are talking at least 24 ounces.  My bill came to about 14 dollars, which I thought was perfectly reasonable considering the size of the beer, the amount and tastiness of the meal.  Would definitely go again.",

    "text": "Just ate Miguel's for lunch today and got my fill of fast food Mexican for a decent price.  I'm not overly impressed by the place, but it makes for a nice meal if you're in the Paw Creek area (85 and Little Rock Rd.).  There's an open \"veranda\" for dining (read: a dining room with out doors or windows attached on the front) that was a nice touch on a day like today.  Fast, cheap, and loaded with salt, what else could you ask from a local Mexican joint?  They have all the regular dishes you would find on a menu in a down-home Mexican place, plus lunches specials for about $5-$6.  I got the Speedy Gonzales, an enchilada, taco, and rice for a respectable $5.75.  The service was rather impersonal and task-focused, but maybe it was just one of those days.   I agree with Tonya that the sketch factor of  restaurants like these \"raise the stakes\": you'll either discover a hidden treasure or the Bates motel.  Miguel's, however, wasn't either one.  So maybe the \"ho-hum\"-ness of this place was my False expectations.  No hidden treasures here, just decent Mexican food.",

I ordered the Fajitas, which were on special for $8, but these were not like any i've had before.  in addition to the standard peppers and onions, they also put in zuchinni, squash, mushrooms, and other veggies that really set the dish off, making them the best fajitas i have eaten.  They also had drink specials, which I do not recall at this moment.  All in all, I had a beer and a great dinner, with leftovers to take home, for less than $12.",
