They claimed to have bar specials, yet when I asked she mentioned just the one martini. Last I checked, specials= plural.. anyway our drinks were good, not great. Not a lot of variety.  This was our first time, so wished someone would have told us about the portions. We could have easily split a pasta entree&salad. Service was decent and the check-out cashiers could pick up the pace. We liked the vibe and would return--just not a regular spot for us.",

    "text": "First time trying this place with some coworkers.  The concept of the restaurant is a little confusing at first because they don't really explain how it all works when you walk in (and there were no signs either).  Upon entering, you're basically given a Vapiano \"credit card\" and you place it on a little space when you order, and that's how they charge you at the end for your food.  You just walk up to the different stations offering Italian dishes ranging from pasta to pizza to antipasta to calzones, etc. Think Chipotle or Subway, because you can watch the line cooks make your order fresh. It's served cafeteria-style and you take your tray to first come, first serve seating.  There's also a bar area and cute little red couch seating areas, as well.  You get a good amount of food for what you pay.  I didn't even finish my lunch portion and took it home. Other than giving no instructions, the staff is friendly and attentive.  I would go back.",

His cooking skills are great and his humor is the cherry in top. Vapiano has a great ambiance and me and my friends love to visit for drinks and music. I can definitely say as long as I can get Roberts great pastas, ill most definitely return for more than just drinks and music and bring more of my friends to experience the greatness.",

I love that they make the pasta in front of you and that the noodles are made on site. I have had their carbonara, chimichurri and vodka pastas. My favorite is the vodka sauce and my least favorite was the chimichurri which was too salty. The insalate de melone which has lettuce, watermelon, canatloupe and shrimps in it is the absulute best. Very refreshing and light for a lunch. Service here is OK, could definitely be better. I'll keep coming here for lunch during my stay in Charlotte and I'm glad theres a branch in NYC so when I go back I will be able to get my pasta fix on.",

Also, be sure to make sure your bill is right before paying.  During one visit, I had apparently picked up the wrong card and was being charged for 3 meals that weren't mine.",

When you first walk in, the person in the very front will hand you a card, similar to a credit card, then you go around to different stations and can order whatever you want from each. They track your orders on the card you received at the beginning of your visit. Once you order, you are given a pager.  When the chef has finished preparing your food, the pager goes off and you go and get it and bring it to your table.  Once finished you pay back at the front.    Overall, I have had very positive experiences with the food.  The staff have been friendly and the salads are large and delicious.  Overall, the prices are low too.  They also have a lot of fun drink specials on different days of the week which is always fun. It's not the fanciest of places,  but I have always enjoyed the experience!",

They give each adult a card when you walk in that looks like a debit card but is really where they put the price of what you order on and you pay when you leave. They could be a bit more helpful to first timers, but it does not take long to learn their system. The food my family ate was all GREAT! We went in the evening so it was not busy. It is a big place, so I can imagine how busy it might get at lunchtime.  Highly recommended!",

After checking out all the food options, I decided to order a pizza and watched as the staff hand-tossed the dough and made the pizza in front of me. The pizza came out hot, fresh and well cooked. It was just the right amount for one person and tasted very good. My wife ordered a chicken pesto sandwiched and also liked it very much.   Our lunch was served in 10 minutes or less and the beverage station was self serve. I'm glad we decided to stop in.  If you are looking for a quick, fresh lunch, you should give this place a try.",

You then swipe your card, and whatever you ordered gets added to the card. Then when you check out they swipe that card and charge you accordingly.   We went here twice and I tried both the fettucini carbonara and the caesar salad. The pasta was really fresh and had just the right amount of sauce. However the lettuce in my salad had already turned slightly brown and you could tell they dressed the salad hours ago instead of tossing it fresh. Small changes like this can go a long way.   The place is huge and has a ton of seating so a great spot for large groups. They can get really busy but the staff seems to work really hard to churn the orders out as quick as possible. Overall we were really impressed with Vapiano and would return.",

    "text": "I went to this place several times over the summer and each time it got better. I consistently had the pizza but my friends always ordered pasta and they gave rave reviews. The concept of this restaurant might be confusing at first but you get the hang of it quickly. I love the atmosphere and I'm excited to be working just down the street from it in a few short months.   This place was also really good with my allergies and I was able to watch them make my food from start to finish. It's a great place to customize what you want and easily add or remove stuff. You would be a fool to order a salad at vapiano because they make the pasta and pizza from scratch in front of your eyes.  If you are looking for a great quick Italian place in uptown, go here! You won't regret it.",

Interesting concept I've not seen before. Sort of cafeteria style in that you go and get your own food, but it's cooked right in front of you to order. When you order, they scan your RFID card and then when you leave, they tally up from that what you had to eat and drink. I would imagine that this place is a crazy madhouse during the lunch rush, but late in the evening, it was pretty quiet and peaceful.  I let my wife hold down the table while I went and got two plates of pasta for us. Chicken alfredo and a meat-filled ravioli. As mentioned earlier, everything is made right to order and you can watch the guy mixing it up as he does it. You want more garlic, less tomatoes? Done.  Oh, and the pasta? Yeah, they make all of that on site too so it's really fresh and not dried out like the stuff you might get in the store.  It was excellent option for late dinner and we'll absolutely be back.  Tip: Try the olive oil for dipping your bread. They've put red pepper flakes in it for a nice little zing.",

You order from whichever food group choice you want - pizza/calzones, salad, pasta - by laying the card on a small screen and telling the person behind the countert which dish you'd like. Then you get a pager and go select a table.   The food was delicious - I had the Toscana pizza and part of my friend's salad. It would be nice if the salads came in smaller portions, but if sharing worked out for us.   The main drawback I found was that you don't have a server. I got up four times while having lunch - Once to get my order after they paged me, twice to refil my glass (the glasses are small), and another time to get a to-go box. I don't really care to interupt my lunch so many times. To be honest, I'd rather leave a tip for a server so that I don't have to get up (I'm not lazy, I swear!).",

I wish that they would make it easier for first timers but alas they enjoyed a lot and agreed to come back soon. No ones meals were cold which has happened to me many of times at Ink and Ivy's, a restaurant near Vapino's. Plus, I would give 5 stars if the employees were a little more patient with there new customers, I have gone many times with friends that have never gone before and they were very nice and patient. This they weren't I have no idea why, they were also different people. So, in the end Vapino's is delicious and very much so recommend this amazing restaurant! It is a very well done CHAIN. WHAT?!? You would never ever know that if you didn't go to their restaurant, which means they care about their food,reputation,and basically every thing else. They are in 3 different countries so they have a bit of everything to eat. Vapino is delicious!",

    "text": "Vapiano is like a beautiful little European import, (well, it IS a European concept)-- big on style, and big on being fresh and hip.  But like that BMW, you're going to have to contend with a lot of a certain kind of buyer, and pay a premium for those add-ons, like salad...er...I mean heated steering wheel.    Seriously though, this place serves a purpose: to serve the folks working in Uptown, so during lunch, it's like an adult cafeteria.  Long lines should be expected. Parking at peak times can also be a beast.   But the food itself, I think is quite yummy. The pastas for example, are all made to order, and the chefs at each station (like the pizza or salad station) make everything fresh before your eyes.  There's something satisfactory about watching a chef (or, I guess more like line cook) assemble your meal, and add sauces and mix and chop.   The place looks like an upscale cafeteria, and you'll definitely pay upscale cafeteria prices, that rival, let's say a Mama Ricotta's.  (I say MR's because it's Italian.)  To those who aren't thrilled about the despondent looking workers...I'd say not all of them have that dull stare.  It depends on who you get.    So yeah, I like Vapiano.  Never do I crave it...but when in Uptown...for a solid pasta and salad meal, without the hubbub of sitting down, ordering and being served, this is the place.",

We thought it would be a nice Italian place, but as we walked in and were told how to do it, we were hesitant but continued to the counters.  The pastas to choose from were a nice selection, and they do a nice white wine sauce with a lot of garlic, which I love.  The bread was really good too, nice and crisp on the outside and chewy in the inside.  Everyone enjoyed their food, from the calzones to the pastas.  Definitely going back here when I'm back downtown.",

There are different stations that you can go to and pick out what your having and be seated.  The pasta sauce was very bland and not flavorful at all. It was all over the place to me.

I ordered the carbonara and it was delicious! It's probably not a traditional carbonara, but it was perfect for my American tastebuds. The side salads and bbq chicken pizza were also a hit. However, the ravioli and bruschetta were just okay.   What might throw you off, is the concept. You basically do everything yourself, except cook the food- and there is no direction given. I even told the hostess it was my first time, but I was just thrown to the wolves. Everyone gets a card that keeps a tab of the things you order at the various food stations. And you ask the cook to add a drink to your tab. This sounds okay. I mean, I loved not having to tip a waiter. However, things were kind of hectic and unorganized. By the time I got my pasta, other people had already finished theirs.  With that said, it's not brain science! I think w/ a little more organization, this place could be a favorite.",

The wooden tables have neat stone centerpieces built in. The lighting is a bit darker and adds a romantic feel which I didn't mind being that I was on a date.   Vapiano has adopted a different style of service with bar stations depending upon the type of food you want: pizza, pasta, salad, etc. We decided on the pizza station, and the specialty pizza which featured capers, sun-dried tomatoes, Italian sausage, and black and green olives. Pizza only comes in one size but it was still plenty of food.   The service here was great although it is basically self serve at the bar stations. You order, then take a pager and sit down; once your food is ready they place it on top of the bar and you place the beeper inside the basket. It was quite a seamless process and the food was ready in no time. The food was excellent, but I was even more impressed by the layout and design of the restaurant. Vapiano will have no trouble keeping its customers happy.",

The gentleman who took our order at the pasta station was both lifeless and rude. He almost acted bothered to take our order and didn't even make eye contact with me nor did he respond to my questions. As I watched other people come to the counter everyone behind it was unapproachable. Our 2 orders of pasta took over 20 minutes to receive as he went at a tremendously slow pace.

The tables are beautiful and long and adorned with rosemary or basil plants that you can pick off and add to your entree.  It's a card style ordering model and you walk up to each area and order your food. You scan a card and pay at the end. Whatever is accrued on the card will be paid when you're done.  I like spicy, so I went with the arabiatta sauce. They spice it with JALAPENOS! That's...different. I mean, I like jalapenos, but that seemed like anything BUT Italian. It was just okay and not as spicy as I would've liked.  The bruschetta was okay, but the pesto was better. It was probably the best flavor out of everything we ordered.  I couldn't resist a balsamic salad and I consider myself kind of a connoisseur, but it tasted like bottled Kraft dressing! It was thick and syrupy, almost like corn syrup was in it. It was also too sweet.   The tables had chili oil, balsamic and EVOO, but no Parmesan. I would've loved that to dip my bread into.   The lasagna was also just okay. The theme of our visit was just... OKAY.   Other than the awesome ability to host a big group of friends and have it be nice-casual without the awkwardness of bill-splitting, this place gets a pass in my book.",

Today I had Caesar salad with shrimp & coconut curry soup (thin-not chunky). The Caesar dressing is house made with anchovies...perfect. Unimprovable. A fresh squeeze of lemon made it pop.  The soup had just the right amount of coconut and curry. Milder not too spicy.   Staff are all fantastic and ready to help.  The atmosphere is fun and child friendly.

When you walk in the host hands you a card that you will use to swipe after ordering anything you want to eat or drink. All you have to do is walk up to the station you want to order from, place your order and swipe your card. In a few minutes your meal will be ready - and its all delicious!  I ended up ordering pasta (which is all made fresh in the restaurant) I got the Estiva which was cooked in a light sauce - it was good but to me it could have had a little more flavor. The chicken was very plain and the sun dried tomatoes seemed to be over powering for the dish.   The pizzas all looked and smelled amazing, I will probably try one the next time I go. my friend ordered the Strawberry Salad which was absolutely delicious very crisp and fresh!  When you are done eating they have bussers that will come clean your table. You take your card up to the host and she was scan it and that's when you pay.   Don't forget to grab some gummy bears on your way out - they're free!",

Just let people order at ONE central window or area and then bring it to their table or call their name or number. The way you are doing it is making a lot of people mad.

If you have haven't been before, when you walk in, it looks appealing and smells good. They hand you a blank credit card and you walk up to the food stations to order. Pizza station first, then the pasta stations. Then you take a seat and wait to pick up your food. When I went with my friend, she had never been before, she was utterly confused by the place, several people cut in front of her at the food stations, and she had to wait forever for her meal. When she got it, she said it was mediocre at best and she was never coming back with me. I have been during the work week lunch time crowd (go at 11:30am or the lines become unmanageable) and for the 5pm dinner. They do have a small outdoor seating area but don't bother as all you are doing is watching office workers go home!  As for my meal, I got the pizza- it was an undercooked bland mess. Then I got the pasta, there is a difference between al dente and hard. This restaurant needs to spend the extra 3 minutes and make sure the food is cooked thoroughly.   To Vapiano: either do table service or set it up cafeteria style, this in-between business is not working.",

The ambiance is great, big room, lots of tables and bar area and the food is delicious and not expensive. We love coming here because it makes it simple when it comes time to check out and pay for your meal. You pay for what YOU order without having to divide and separate checks.   Its like a Fancy Italian version of Chipotle, except they cook it fresh in front of your face.   My favorite items are: the Shrimp & fennel salad! soooo flavorful and different! Every person Ive recommended this to and has eaten it, all fell in love with it.  Spaghetti Carbonara with chicken. just be careful, its super heavy and i suggest you force yourself to share with someone because, i ate the WHOLE thing even though I knew i was full, but i couldnt help it. it was so creamy and tasty! bacon bits fried and mixed in with the chicken and pasta. topped with cheese. *drool*  Spaghetti and meat sauce. Its simple, but delicious. The meatball is very moist and the sauce isnt too overwhelming with marinara.  Although Ive heard great reviews on their pizza, I personally wasnt raving about it. I like thick crust, more carbs please! Its very fresh here, but too thin in my opinion. The hubby likes it though.  This is a great place for group dinner without the hassle of splitting checks. The foods great, theres live music sometimes, everyones responsible for their own orders, theres fresh herbs you can pick, and the cost is super duper decent. I cant wait to come back!!!   *warning* since they do cook your food fresh right there in front of you... you may come out of the restaurant spelling like pasta and pizza lol.",

His pasta had too much sauce on the bottom it's almost like a noodle soup than a pasta dish,he had to ask for another bowl to drain the sauce. The pasta taste decent,not awesome but not awful. The beef was cooked perfectly tender.  The bartender however was the total opposite of the cook that prepare our food, he was attentive and friendly.  We would've never come back after the bad customer service at the kitchen but the bartender and the food save this place.  Hopefully next time we won't get that rude cook to prepare our food again.

The concept of this restaurant is pretty unique; the drinks were good, the service was fairly fast, and I enjoyed the fact that the food is made fresh to order. Although I wasn't \"wowed\" by anything, it had to be good enough for me to return a second time (with my boyfriend) and a third time (with some co-workers). Each time was enjoyable--I opted for one of the pizza's on each trip and wasn't disappointed. My only gripe would be they should offer some different varieties of the toppings--just something to switch up a little.  Other than, this is a great place to go downtown, although you'll want to get there early if you're going on Saturday; the place is shoulder-to-shoulder and you won't be able to get a seat for an hour or two, maybe longer.",

The trick is to go early before the Banking crowd overruns the place.....so 1130 is ideal.   I had the Americana Pizza, with marinara, fresh mozzerella, pepperoni and italian sausage, and I had them add onions and mushrooms. Neopolitan style, not \"NY\" style (with that cruddy foldable crust - EW) so it was nice and crispy on the edges and soff (mayble a little too soft) in the middle. Overall a nice lunch pizza. Decent size too.  My buddy had their pasta carbonarra. THAT was delicious.....I deliberately did NOT order that because I wanted to avoid this (mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm) on my computer when my chin hit the keyboard!

I would definitely recommend this play if you want Italian food.",

    "text": "What a cool lunch concept!  I'm not understanding the horrible reviews -- if you want fine dining then go get fine dining this is certainly not it.  This is a quick, convenient, and tasty lunch option.  I had pretty much an hour with a client before I had to make the trek up to Mooresville (I'm from Atlanta) and my client suggested this as it's walking distance from her office and we wouldn't have to fetch cars from the parking decks.   When you walk in they give you a card and you can walk up to the pizza, pasta, or salad counters and order what you want.  Once you place your order, you get a buzzer and it will buzz when your food is ready for pick up at the counter.  The fountain drinks are in the back but water is in the front.  When you are ready to leave you pay at the counter.  I'm glad my client knew all of this because it was CROWDED and I would have been a bit confused with out her.   We both ordered the Margherita pizza.  It's huge! Both of us ate about half of ours.  It comes with fresh basil and tomato.  The crust is light and crispy and the sauce isn't too sweet or over powering.  I loved my pizza but the salads did look good as well!  I would definitely try one if i make it back.",

I was underwhelmed at first by the concept and ambience - maybe I was having a bad day or maybe I wasn't quite open to taking in Vapiano for what it is.   What it is: An upscaled a la carte dining experience where efficiency is a priority for a very reasonable price.  And for that, I think Vapiano is great and holds a special place in my hungry-for-Italian heart. I really like that their \"homemade\" noodles have a bit of a chew and are generally always cooked to a consistency that I like. I tried their pappardelle with bolognese sauce once and I've been hooked ever since. You can customize your order by adding basil, mushrooms, jalapenos, etc. according to what you like. I also appreciate that you can come in without reservations on a Friday/Saturday night and know that you will be able to find a seat, even if it is sharing a table with a few other people.   The only downside is you need to be prepared to speak loudly (kind of yell) in order to be heard by the pasta chefs sometimes, since they are in the midst of all the cooking sizzles. Last time, I asked for pappardelle and got tagliatelle instead. SAD FACE.",

I had a salad with shrimp and some  sweet chili type dressing that just was a weird combination of things.  Kind of like a salad you would make at home when you need to go food shopping and don't have a lot things that match.  It wasn't terrible.  More like odd and confusing!  The flatbread(I'm not going to call it pizza... As a New Yorker I just can not) is tasty and made fresh but I'm not that big on flatbreads so again I wasn't impressed.  Three stars because the food is not bad, it's just not my thing, and I love the citrus water but I don't love the cafeteria style of having to get up and get my good and refill my water unless I'm at a fast food place.  It just wasn't my jam.",

You walk in and the friendly hostess gave me a card to use at the different stations to put my order on. It acts almost like a credit card and you pay the balance when you leave.  I went to the soup and salad station and ordered the Greek salad and a cup of the soup of the day which was a cream of asparagus.  You take a pager and can have a seat anywhere you like. This is one fancy cafe and the decor is all very modern. I sat at the bar and ordered a red sangria which they are known for while I waited. Yes it  was tasty and I highly recommend. The wait was not long at all for my food.  The soup was fantastic and had a great flavor. My salad was just ok as I had very large chunks of the lettuce core that you cannot eat in the salad.  The bartender was great and I would like to go back to try some of their pizza and pasta entrees.",

You get a little card instead of a menu.  You wait in line to order your food and find your own seat, but the atmosphere definitely doesn't look like a food court.   Once you figure it out, it's not too bad.  Grab a menu and go wait in the line you're interested in. Order your food and put your card on the little scanner, and boom. You're on your way to a delicious lunch.  The pasta line seemed to be the longest.  The basil pesto with campanelle was tasty but a tad oily. The bread helped get rid of that greasy feeling though. The pasta itself was cooked to perfection, as my campanelle was chewy and soft.  Water cups are at the bar!   Vapiano seems to reserve tables too so if you're thinking of stopping by with a large group during the lunch rush, try to call ahead of time.",

On Saturdays the restaurant closes at 12 midnight, but then it turns into a nightclub with a dj or band. Last night they had a dj. The cover is $10. My gripe was that I stood on line for over 30 minutes and when I got inside... sure the bar and dance floor areas were crowded, but the back was pretty much open.   I don't know how much the drinks were because I'm not much of a drinker and I drove.. like to be responsible and not get myself into questionable situations. I met friends there, which was also frustrating since they got there early for dinner and stayed.. I couldn't find them for the longest and then they pretty much wanted to leave since they were smashed. We stayed about an hour or less after my friend found me. Lol I'm not sure how late the club is open or even if it's every Saturday or sporadic Saturdays. Just used my name!! :-)  The vibe inside is cool, music was on point and it's definitely dress to impress. I came after work and fit in fine. I would definitely return with friends but go together or pre-plan the meeting spot to kill frustrations. Lol",

When you leave, you give the card to the hostess at the front and she uses it to determine what you bought/your bill.  Throughout the restaurant they have various stations (bar, pizza, pasta, ETC.).    We stopped in for a drink before heading to a game a BOA stadium.  The food did look delicious...maybe next time!  I got a sangria (red) and it was good.    I will say the service at the bar was pretty slow.  They only had one bartender on duty and maybe in the future they should have at least two when there is a game on the schedule.  Overall, if I was in the area I would stop by again.",

She Shoved the card and menu in my face, said some things, and then moved on to the next person.   2) The card system- I don't like having to get up to go get my food. But even beyond that, I hand my card to the person behind the counter who swipes it then goes back to cooking. With all my germs and who knows what else from the floor and other people on his hands. Made me not want to eat.  3) The food- I didn't like my food at all.  I had the verdure pizza, and it just wasn't good. There was very little cheese on it and there were too many large, heavy vegetables for the thin flimsy pizza slices.  4) Layout- They had my party in the front of the restaurant, which meant we had to walk to the back for our food, and keep going to the far corner of the restaurant for our drinks. Inconvenient. They also had us at a table with stools, which was extremely inconvenient because the stools were so tall and many of us were so short.  I won't be going back.",

It was a little confusing as a first timer, but I figured it out. I got chicken alfredo and it tasted good, but was not the best. One frustrating thing was after I got in line, there was a bachelorette party of 10 girls or more who came behind me and even though I stood at the counter and place my order, the gentleman that waited on me was apparently slower than the rest because most of the girls that were behind me in line had their meals fixed and set down before I ever receive my food. So I guess if you're wanting something fast this may not be the best place to go. It is neat that they make the food right in front of you though.

Gluten-free risotto is delicious and filling and comes with 2 pieces of bread-- so that's not gluten free.   They have a few mini desserts in a case at the bar to choose from as well, and free gummy bears by check out.   The staff preparing your food are not the friendliest, and the noise can be moderate, especially when there are big groups since it's one big dining area, but overall my experiences have been positive!",

This place is particularly cool because you walk right up to the chef to place your order and they cook it in front of you! Pretty cool to watch your food being made fresh. Only negative is it is a little hard to hear the chef sometimes during the lunch rush. Overall, great place with amazing food. It's definitely a hot spot in uptown for lunch so go early!",

The  broccoli was cooked perfectly, and the tomatoes were fresh, but the bell peppers were overpowering and kinda soggy  We ended up picking out the bell peppers, mixing the two dishes together, and splitting it up.",

Their system can be a little confusing especially if it is busy the first time you come here, or if you have a family or large group that one person is paying for since each person has to have a card that is swiped upon ordering. After placing my order and swiping my card, they somehow misplaced my order and never made it -- I had to go back and order again when everyone else in my group was nearly done eating. Maybe not the most efficient way to manage things. It's a little bit like a food court within a single restaurant.  All the food I've tried has been really good and very fresh tasting. It's nice in warm weather when the front opens up to the street. Pasta, pizza, and salads are all really good!",

The decor is great, they have plants on each table and a tree in the middle of the restaurant-giving it s very fresh, earthy vibe.    The service was good, it's almost like a self service place, so there isn't a lot of interaction with the staff, but when choosing your food, they are exceptionally helpful.  The food was decent.

We walked in at 8:45pm and they were cleaning everything up,  they said they don't close until 11:00pm but the pizza maker had everything put away and busy cleaning up.  What was disgusting to me is that he never washed his hands properly between cleaning and making food and was too busy talking to someone else behind the salad area that he couldn't hear me talking to him so he kept repeating himself asking me to scan my card and I kept telling him I did.  The coke bottle that was given to my wife was covered in whatever he was cleaning with.  The cheese on the pizza had a funny taste to it so only 2 pieces.  The pasta guy was good he had a great attitude, and a lot of energy and the pesto pasta I had tasted good.",

It's a thin crust, freshly made pizza with cheeses, marinated tomatoes, olive oil and arugula. So good. I recommend it. The chicken pesto pizza is good too. Try this place.

I had the BBQ chicken pizza and my significant other had the lasagna. I thought the BBQ chicken was tasty, the sauce was a little on the sweeter side. The lasagna was flavorful and had the right amount of cheese. It's a good choice if you're looking for something mid priced as everything is a la carte. But the ambiance is great for hanging with friends or date night. The bathrooms were an added bonus. Plenty of mirrors in the ladies restroom with a full length mirror between the ladies and gents restrooms.",

The restaurant is located in the heart of uptown Charlotte, so good luck finding reliable street parking -- you might have to save about $10 for parking in the (almost full) lots on some adjacent streets, especially during the lunch rush.  I stood awkwardly outside the restaurant for 15 minutes waiting for my friends to park, and noticed that Vapiano was the ONLY establishment on the entire block to have any foot traffic at all.  Everybody who passed by me either came from the restaurant or were going into it.  It was hyping me up for some delicious, hot Italian food.  And believe me, I was ready.  I didn't realize how big the restaurant was until I walked in.  It's like a classy cafeteria, and you have a ton of chefs in one line ready to make whatever kind of pasta/pizza/other Italian food you want.  You wait for your food up front, put it on a tray, and seat yourself.  Regular water and citrus-infused water is at a station at the bar.  To be honest, I'm not really too big on the Italian food.  But the food was pretty good and flavorful and came out decently quick.  I even wish I had more of it for the price I paid, but it's not unreasonable by any means.  I would definitely go back if I was in the area more often.",

I had been to a different location in DC and really enjoyed it, but that might have been because I had my boyfriend wait in all the lines while I lounged, ha. We recently visited the Charlotte Uptown location using a Groupon.  I really don't mind the concept of cafeteria style and using the swipe card to tally your bill. It's the waiting in line I loathe. So, it was probably a mistake to come here on a Friday night at 8pm... it was PACKED. I waited in line over 10 minutes just to order a salad. Okay, so not too crazy, but my boyfriend was in the pasta line ordering for both of us, it had to have been at least 25 minutes. I was pretty pissed at the restaurant at this point, having to wait by myself at our table.  On a positive note, this atmosphere is super cool. I love the decor, chalk board art, trees, red accents. And even though the wait was extremely too long, the food was delish!  Pasta is made fresh daily. I ordered PESTO E SPINACI, very very good. My favorite however was the STRAWBERRY SPINACH SALAD. I'm all about the FCN salads (fruit, cheese, nut)! I highly recommend this salad to anyone!   We ordered the BRUSCHETTA TRIO as an appetizer, very good. Super hearty bread, fresh tomatoes, and fresh shaved cheese. You definitely get a good deal for the quality of the food.  I will come back here, but ONLY on a weekday. Props for vegetarian friendly food. Parking sucks, but that goes with anywhere uptown I guess.  UPDATE: This place is sooooooo much better on a weekday or very early on the weekend. I love the quality and the freshness of the food. Holla!",

This place is gorgeous - shared tables - so be aware. You can grab fresh herbs from the \"garden\" to add to your meal. I enjoyed the spicy shrimp, fennel and orange salad.

But I can never figure you out and in the end I'm frustrated and down a few dollars.    Ive been in 3 or 4 times in the last 3 or 4 years and each time I'm given a card to do what with now?  Give it to someone and then bring it back?  Nevermind I'll figure it out later.  Then I walk towards the delicious smelling food and am immediately reminded why I haven't been here in a year.  I have no idea how to actually get the food.  There is just a mass of people (business is good!).  Those people are smiling and happy and pleasant but they are just standing around.  Its like I've wandering into a party thats been going on for some time where everyone is cooler and younger than me and I'm lost and confused.  The pizza looks good, do i just muscle infront of everyone, do i just grab a pizza, do i order one?  I honestly still don't know.  So then i move towards the salads, but this is even more people just standing around.  Then i move towards the pasta.  Can't go wrong with pasta.  I study the situation, ask a few people and it appears that you play innie meanie minnie moe and pick a chef.  then you stand behind a few people but directly infront of the chef and hope that sometime soon he or she will make eye contact to give you some hope that you are standing in the correct spot.  They have never made eye contact with me.  Then  i usually see a manager and beg for help.  In the past the manager has spoken with the chef and directed the chef to take my order.  If i make it this far, the food is prepared after too many questions and I do something with the card and have a nice meal.",

Ended up here because we have been eating large, expensive dinners and this place was a lunch choice on another visit and we enjoyed our food.  A bowl of well made potatoe soup and a plate of pasta, shrimp, lemon, and spinach was the choices.  The soup was very good, hot, and pureed vs lumpy, sometime cheesy, potatoe soup.   The pasta fish was very well made.  I was clear to the preparer that less dressing is nearly always better and she deftly made the sauce just to the right proportion.  I am not sure if you can beat the prices in the downtown, make that uptown, area.  Kinda Italian semi fast food that is well prepared.  A good combination!",

    "text": "Came here on a Thursday night. It wasn't too crowded but was pretty loud definitely a more modern establishment. Semi communal tables if you have a small party and a large large seating area. There was no help in how to order or what to do. If I hadn't been with a friend I would have been completely lost and likely left. Staff was very friendly all around but messed up one of our orders. This is an Italian place and she put spaghetti noodles when we asked for fusilli... not very similar. In addition my pasta was completely messed up. My pasta gained mushrooms which and I did not order and did not include spinach also when they put meat in your pasta it means like four pieces  What im confused about is the decor seems to clash between a Asian sir down place and a craft beer establishment. Almost none of it screams Italian. There are literally trees growing out of tables and a full \"tree bar\". I had heard great things so it's easy to be let down but the fact is we were not asked if we had been here before or knew how to order, which is a big deal since this is not a traditional sit down restaurant. Both my girlfriends and I's order was messed up and not once did we see any kind of manager present in the restaurant at peak dinner time. I can't say I won't be back but for 35 bucks it's not worth it honestly olive garden has better trained chefs and service professionals.",

No one came by to apologize or even check on things. I did ask for him at the end of the meal and explained to him what happened. At that time he said this normally doesn't happen, it was the opening manager that didn't set it up properly and apologized. All in all, not a good experience.

It may not be village style or traditional, but in addition to your standard kalamata olives (and plenty of them), feta, cucumbers, and finely diced onion, they have added CAPERS and pretty pretty dill. I believe it's the combination of the capers and the dressing that takes this salad to the next level.  The dressing (which I asked for on the side) must be nectar of the gods. I don't know what's in it, but it took my day from 0 to 10 in the first bite. I can only imagine how french fries would taste dipped in the dressing, stop it just stop it now!  I can't recommend any of the other items as I have not eaten anything else, but I will be back any time I'm craving a Greek salad (averaging once a week).",

The place was packed, so luckily I was with someone who had been and explained the layout. As one other yelper said it is comparable to food court, yet an upscale Italian food court. I chose the pizza/panini isle, still debating which one to go with. When I reached the counter, they suggested the pizza. I ordered the chicken pesto pizza and it was so good. Very large, definitely could have shared, but it had a great crust, fresh chicken and cheese, and the pesto was great!  My friend ordered the Greek salad, which she loved. I will say I saw a few pasta plates that looked great! I will be back.  One thing I will point out, it was packed during the 11:30-1:30 lunch hour which can be tight or difficult for someone trying to grab a nice/quick lunch.  I hope you all give it a try, a delight in uptown in my mind.",

    "text": "Okay so this review is on my experience at the \"lounge\" after hours. I went with some friends who wanted to hang out (there was also a social experiment involved) when this joint turns into a nightclub... OH WAIT! It's a lounge. What is a lounge? Does it involve me screaming at the top of my lungs because the music is so loud when talking to someone? Does is it involve dancing to hip and r&b music on a dance floor? Does it involve a DJ playing music that makes you want to shake your ass on the dance floor?   Now I'm not hating on the experience and I'm not knocking what people refer to this place after 11 PM. But ummmmm... I thought a lounge involved yes music, but not so loud that I'm screaming at the top of my lungs to have a conversation.   Oddly enough there are a good number of people (I asked) who refer to this as a lounge. A lot of people are hanging back watching people walk around, eat, dance, whatever. It's odd. Maybe I'm just out of touch with this scene.   When you go in they give you this card that you use to order food. If you lose it, you have to pay $50. At the end of the night or whenever you leave, you give the card back and pay for whatever you purchased. I like the concept, but that would totally suck if someone steals another person's card. Basically, guard that card with your life.   My friend's pizza was good (bail, mozzarella, sauce). Nothing to brag about. Maybe I'll go back just for some food... when I can actually carry on a conversation.",

You walk in and are handed what feels and looks like a ski pass card with no explanation (which duh, if they had to explain it every single time that would be a pain and create traffic jams at the door). Maybe just a quick description of the process of dining here on the card would help?   However, I used to eat at Vapiano in Germany all the time so I knew what to do. My mom was totally clueless though and said that if I weren't there she would have just handed the card back and left since she felt so lost.   **Anyone reading this that's never been there: Go grab a menu from the main desk at the front, step off to the side, and decide what you want! Then just go to one of the lines for said desired dish, wait your turn, and then order! They make it right there in front of you. Shouldn't take more than 5ish minutes (and if you can't stand and wait that long, you're lazy). There are trays, silverware, and napkins right next to the counter, and salt/pepper, olive oil, and balsamic on the tables. Once you order, lay your card down on the little square (usually they'll prompt you), and the card gets loaded with your balance. Voila! Eat, leave your tray (they'll clean up after you), take your card up to that front desk, and pay. :)  I've never been disappointed with their food in Germany, and this location in Charlotte was just as great (even better - no language barrier!)",

The concept is different and fun and it works.  You get a card that you scan at each station so you can eat at your leisure.  Then pay at the end.  The downside is that it's easy to forget how much you are spending!  We started with bruchetta, which was good, as usual.  You get two slices of bread with a generous portion of bruchetta.  Just enough for one or two people.  My step daughter had chicken fettuccine and thought it was very good.  I'm not a fettuccine fan, but found it to be better than average.  My fiancee had the cheese and spinach ravioli and it was great.  Their sauce is wonderful and of our three dishes, I liked it the best.  I ordered the Italian Thai and found it to be good but not as flavorful as I'd hoped, considering it is one of the most expensive items.  We finished with a very tasty tiramisu that we split three ways.  My step daughter is a picky eater and she really liked the experience.  As for me, Nothing to complain about and I'll definitely return!  Oh yeah...ALWAYS get their house Sangria!   It's the best!",

You then look through the menu and go to the corresponding station to order your meal. You swipe your card at the station, you're given a pager and then you have a seat wherever you'd like. You pick up your own utensils and drinks . The drink station is at the back next to the restrooms and the utensils are near the food stations. When your order is ready, your pager goes off and you go get your food at the station you ordered from. When you're done with your meal, you go to the front (where you got your card) and they swipe it to get the total price of your meal. It's cool because sometimes waiters aren't very attentive and this takes that element right out. Sadly, I couldn't give it 5 stars because, the restaurant was kind of messy with food on a lot of the tables and on the floor. Also, my food was REALLY spicy with jalapenos when my meal didn't even have it listed on the menu . Either way, I liked the whole concept of the restaurant and would probably come back again.",

Both my boyfriend and I finished our plates and we're full, yet not too full. So the portions for each dish are really well thought out.   The pasta is made in house and was absolutely delicious. It made me want to learn how to make my own pasta someday so I can eat that quality in my own home.   Overall, 10/10 experience and I can't want to come back and eat more food!",

    "text": "I walked in and was immediately impressed by the vibe and the set up of the restaurant. I came in to try something new during my lunch break. I hopped in the pasta line and the line did not move for so long that I realized I would be late getting back to work if I stayed in this line. No big deal, I hopped over to the shorter salad and panini line. I'd try the pasta another day. The man who helped me wasn't too friendly. I had forgotten to mention that I needed the food to-go, so I came back up to him and asked if I could get it in a to-go box. He wasn't too happy about that. A while later, now panicking that I'd be late for work, my pager beeped. I came up and asked if that box was mine, received confirmation that it was, and grabbed it. I looked inside and it definitely was not my order. I let them know that it must be someone else's. Again, not a big deal. Finally, after getting my order and bringing it back to the office to eat, my initial thought was that the chicken was dry. I check my pesto panini to find....no sign of pesto. That was the final straw that led me to posting this review. Great potential and great idea for a location but not a great experience in the end, sadly! I'd say only come if you have plenty of time and are able to stay to eat.",

Personally, I find the \"smart card payment system\" to be pretty confusing, given I'm not a regular, but I can see how it is efficient in the madness of downtown Charlotte lunch rush.  The \"smart card payment system\" is a pain when trying to order drinks at the bar when it's crowded.    Again though, all of the food is delicious.  Highly recommend the scampi e spinaci with linguini (you pick your own pasta noodles).  Very nice outdoor patio, with 4-5 small tables.  I will definitely continue to come back here.",

We visited on a thursday night, not busy at all. The shop is both clean and tidy, having plenty seating space, good parking on street after 7pm. Staff members greeted us when we can in/ out when we left. I would give this restaurant another chance in the future.

    "text": "We were not Vapiano Virgins when drawn in by the Breakfast menu out front on a recent Sunday morning. Having enjoyed the one in DC for dinner in the past, and more recently a stop at this Charlotte one on a food tour for a drink and dessert, we already had fond memories of Vapiano.  (me more-so than Husband, as he still debates the \"cafeteria\" style).  Anyway, Sunday morning in Uptown staying at the nearby Omni, we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  (There was one other couple who seemed very happy with their breakfast).  TIP: Get the breakfast pizza!  There are a few to choose from. Husband got one with bacon and sausage and it was way bigger and way yummier than he expected.  Had we known, we would have shared it.  (I still stole bites of his).  My Italian \"Crepe\" was way heavier than I expected. It was quite thick and hearty.  Turkey and Spinach in it were good...tomatoes, not overly fresh as it's off-season for them.  I found myself digging out the insides to eat and leaving the heavy \"crepe\" to be sadly discarded.  (hate wasting food!)  They obviously (wisely) use down-times to do prep work, so staff-wise, they weren't prepared at all for actual guests.  Fortunately we weren't in any hurry.",

Over time, water cups got smaller, dessert portions got smaller, the quality of the pasta is not consistent, not even cooked the same depending on who is your chef. Honestly, I was a bit taken aback when I ordered the creme brulee and the barista poured sugar on top of my cream brulee and toasted it with a torch to make the sugar harden on top to create a crust, ehh...well anyway, I guess this is a very hands on kinda place so you won't find like a legit chef. But seriously, I am disappointed, because Vapianos has always been an all time favorite for me. And their bathrooms, needs serious attention, enough said.   $7.95 is the cheapest option for pasta, panini and pizza, goes up top about $12.95.  $2.95 is the cheapest for dessert, goes up to about $4.95.  $5.50 for sangria.",

I felt more like I was in a modern day cafeteria than a restaurant. I liked it - but perhaps dim the lights a tad in the evening.   I started with a super/fresh delicious strawberry mojito. Since it took a few minutes to serve us, the bartender served us up a complimentary shot -which was a great touch. He was one of the friendliest bartenders I've come across in awhile. I went with pizza  for dinner- the salame, which was good not great. It tasted like regular peperoni  (not a favorite of mine) and needed a little more sauce. My friend had the bruschetta pizza which looked killer, so I'd get that next time. The portion was huge and at a little over $7 it was a steal!   Some people do not like the cards, but I felt like it was great. They definitely passed the savings onto the diner without skimping on quality ingredients. I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Vapiano's is designed and laid out like a stylish European quick service restaurant. As you walk in you are handed a plastic charge card the size of a credit card. When you order the food, the price is added to the card and you pay for everything as you leave.  Since everything is self service, tipping is not required, however, leaving a couple of dollars for the person cleaning tables never hurts.  The food selection ranges from a wide variety of pasta (made fresh in house) with different meat, vegetable and sauce options to pizza, sandwiches and salads. All of the dishes are priced reasonably and the portion sizes are generous.   The overall atmosphere is casual with decor that would not be out of place in a much more upscale restaurant.   There are two reasons why Vapiano's did not receive a 5 star rating from me:  The amount of meat, seafood, etc. that comes with most of the dishes tends to be on the small to miniscule side.  The other proplem is the consistency of the food. Depending on the cook that prepares your order, your food may be over or under seasoned.  The other night we ordered the Pesto E Spinaci and the \"hint\" of basil pesto ended up being a big heaping boat load of pesto.  Overall the is a very good place to go if you are looking for good food at a fair price. As long as you don't mind getting your own food and drink refills you should be able to enjoy Vapiano's.",

The prices are reasonable, nothing over $9.95 on the menu unless you add extras.  I ordered the Verdure which has Roasted Eggplant, Zucchini, Red & Yellow Peppers,  Mozzarella Cheese, Pesto, Spinach.  My coworker ordered Pasta, the Ravioli Ricotta e Spinaci which is Ravioli With Spinach And Ricotta Filling, Tomato Sauce.  His Pasta was made before my Panini, but only by a minute or two.    The Panini seemed a little on the small side, but was enough fill me up.  The house salad was nothing special.  Iceburg lettuce with shredded carrots and some tomatoes.  The didn't ask about dressing, so I am assuming there is only the house dressing which is an Italian.   My Panini tasted OK, but it was not grilled long enough.  There were light brown grill marks on the bread and the veggies inside were cold to luke warm and the mozzarella wasn't melted at all.  I should have taken it back and had them grill it more, but since my coworker already had his meal I decided not to because he would probably be done with his meal by the time I got my sandwich re-grilled.  I probably will give Vapiano's one more try and get the pasta or pizza next time to see it is better.  If you are heading here for a Panini, skip it and try somewhere else.",

The food is decent; I like that they make everything in front of you so you have control over how much of each ingredient goes into your dish. I wasn't ever blown away with the quality though, and my meals haven't been consistent (sometimes they drown my pasta in sauce and other times there hardly any toppings, which is why I started watching them make it and ask for more/less sauce/toppings).

Don't be intimidated by the self service system.  It's not rocket science. Take your card they give you when you come in to the station you prefer;  Pizza or Pasta and order. They have a small menu or you can create your own.  You scan your card as you place your order and take a buzzer which will go off when your food is done.

    "text": "You can't help but want to try this place out... at least for me when I drove by a few weeks ago.  The vast open space in the middle of uptown Charlotte, a spanking new bar in front of an open window.  So yesterday I went to test this place out for a late casual lunch.  I heard of the European Self-Service system, but it's still a bit confusing.  The hostess could have done a better job explaining, that's after I asked them about it (what happened to \"have you been here before... let me explain how this work?\").  Luckily on a late Sunday afternoon this place was virtually empty, so I didn't feel as bad for my cluelessness.  Basically you are given a card, which you swipe (think key card kinda swipe) before you order so they can keep track of your tab.    We decided to split an Americana pizza.  I was interested in a side of soup, which sadly they didn't have any.  What's worse is when I asked the Pizza guy about soup, the response was something similar to \"I don't know, ask her.\"  When I asked \"her\" the salad lady, it took her quite a time to acknowledge my existance, only for her to tell me not only they didn't have soup, but because they didn't have the ingredients to make soup... interesting.  Speaking of missing ingredients.  When we ordered my sangria at the bar, the bartender didn't have the basil... but he was gladly going to look for some in the kitchen.  I told him to just give me the $4 house white, but he forgot to change the order on the tab.  Basically it was quite choatic for a late Sunday afternoon, I can't imagine what it would be like during lunch rush!  (FYI, Captain & Coke is $8.50)  Food was decent.  $9 pizza is big enough to share if no one is starving.  The pizza was definitely fresh, I wish there were more toppings.  I glanced through the pasta menu, and I am wanting to try it next time.    I can see why some people think it's not at all impressive, but I LOVE the space!  The red seating area by the bar, the clean simple lines of the furnitures, the openness, the high ceiling... all so causal yet chic.  For its location, I think this is a great affordable place to grab a quick bite and chit chat.    To sum it up, 2-star for service (very sad for a self-serve place), 3-star for food, 5-star for atmosphere!",

    "text": "Imagine a modern-day spin on your traditional cafeteria and add a decidedly Italian take on the cuisine.  Now then, you've got the concept for Vapiano.    In fairness, the food is cooked or prepared to order and you do pay at the end by basically tabbing out on the credit card you are given upon entry.  But, you do end up standing in line during busier times and everything is basically self-serve- from drinks to re-orders.  As mentioned by others, the space is quite open and expensive with chic modern lines and pops of color- from the red fabrics at the bar to the green herbs growing in small pots at both the tables and a middle display rack.  The high tables are nice, but I found the marble condiment and lamp holders cemented to the middle of the tables quite an impediment to speaking with your companions across the table or trying to share a plate.  My wife did, though, appreciate the purse hooks attached to the table sides.    On a weekend visit, the wife and I shared a roasted garlic pizza and an order of whole wheat spaghetti with arribiata sauce.  We both also had Cesar salads to start.  Salads were appropriately sized and priced for side items.  Lettuce was fresh and the croutons were plenty crunchy.  I'll agree that the Cesar dressing, while good, was a tad bit much for the portion served.  A little less would have been perfect.  Pasta was cooked to perfection and I give them bonus points for the wholewheat offering, especially since it is all made in-house.  The arribiata sauce was spicy and our \"cook\" offered to customize it to our preference.  Maybe it was the season, but a little basil or extra parsley could be used to balance it out a bit more.  Parmesan was available upon request.  One order is enough to feed a single person, but not so large as to be shared by itself.    Pizza was certainly large and likely could have been a meal enough for us both with our side salads.  Crust was thin and had a good tooth, but not wafer crispy- I like that, personally.  Again, the roasted garlic and cheeses were fine, but a bit of basil could have made this guy shine.    Prices were certainly not cafeteria range, but not so high as to shock the conscience.  The pizza seemed perfectly priced at about $9.00.  Almost the same for pasta and sauce seemed a bit out of range.  In all, this would be a fine place for a quick meal without all the formality of table service.  Certainly that has a nitch in uptown.  All the Italian standards are here, but, aside from a few pizzas, there is nothing new or creative here.  As the stars above say, it's A-OK.",

    "text": "Go to happy hour here, $5 pizzas, enough said.  Right when you walk in you get a card, that card is used to purchase any food you want, it is pretty sweet.  This location is legit because when you walk in, you feel like you are going into the lounge area of a club, beautiful wood seating, high chairs, elegant chairs, high ceilings and some shrubbery.  Best part about the ambiance is the high ceilings, makes you feel like you have a lot of open air and space to think your best ideas.    As for the food, definitely think the hh $5 pizza is fantastic.  It is thin crust and flat pizza, so not overloaded on the toppings, and is great for one person.  Got the meat pizza on this occasion, and eating in this atmosphere was great.  Bottom-line, go in with a nice blazer and get the pizza.",

Pasta is made fresh in store and you can watch them make your food. I'm literally scraping the bottom of my bowl for left overs and I still love it. It's the type of place to leave you so full you can't breathe but you still desire more, it's like you were flown straight to Italy, and like everything is picked from a garden.

    "text": "We had a large group in town for a show at the knight theater and stopped here for dinner. This is a seat yourself restaurant and a serve yourself restaurant. It tries to be a little upscale and mostly pulls it off, but you do wait on yourself. We found a large table that worked for our group of 13. Everyone took off the various lines to order the food they want. You line up in a pasta line, a pizza line, etc. The biggest downside's I see, if you have kids, you probably have to stand in line for them, and then go stand in another line for yourself. Want an alcoholic drink? Then go stand in another line at the bar for that. There was only one bartender the night I was there, so that line was a little frustrating. It isn't necessarily easy for you to coordinate yourself on all those things. When it came time to pay, most people pay as they walk out the front door. You have a card they give you when you come in, and your food gets charged to it in the various lines. Then at checkout, you just give them the card. However, if you bought alcohol, you can't stand in that line, you have to go to the bar to pay, and stand in that line. The food we had was very good. Overall, a decent place. If you were on a date with your wife, a pretty good place. If you have a bunch of kids, I'm not feeling it. You'll run yourself crazy serving them. (which is why you wanted to go out to start with so you don't have to do that!)",

    "text": "Good, Bad and disappointed.  If you have never been here before the first thing you need to know is it is complicated. To my knowledge there is not anything posted that explains the process nor have I found the staff friendly enough to explain to you how ordering works.   When you walk in you will get a plastic card like a credit card. No one will tell you this but you need that card to pay later. So don't lose it. You also need it to place your order. You then stand a line for pasta, salad, or pizza. There are signs for each.  You will find menus along the counter. These may be easy to miss if there are a lot of people in each of the lines. When it is your turn you lay your card down on the scanner and you tell the cook what you want.  You will have no idea that you need to do this unless you notice the person in front of you did it or the person taking your order will give you attitude as they tell you to lay your card down because you are obviously dumb and should know what to do.   The next thing you need to know is it is really loud in the restaurant. Sound bounces off the solid floors.  It is really loud when you try to place your order or when you are trying to hear the person tell you what to do. For example, lay your card down on the reader before you place your order.   Eventually you will figure it out and place your order. Now you wait. They used to have pagers so you would know your order was ready and to come pick it up, but on my last experience they did not have the pagers anymore. You just had to look at the top of the counter and see if that was your order that was just set on top. It is not the most efficient process. I would recommend bringing back the pagers.  Here is some good news. The food is pretty good. You can see a room off to the side where they make their own pasta. The food is cooked to order so it is always fresh. There are lots of pasta options and sauces. Overall it is a good meal.  It is cooked to order so be patient. I would not say the cooking process is slow but it takes time to cook some chicken. So it is not going to happen in two minutes.   While I do not eat here often I was very disappointed in my last visit. They got my friends order completely wrong and had to remake it. Hers came out in a decent amount of time, she ordered the chicken alfredo, so the time to remake it was not a big deal. However they did not bump her up in queue to remake it. They made everyone else's in line 1st and then remade hers. We had a show to catch at Blumenthal. So she did not get to eat much of it before we had to leave. They also got my order wrong but my food did not come out timely. I did not have time to let them remake it. There was not a manager available when I asked, but when I spoke to the front desk they were unapologetic or unwilling to do anything about it.   There are lots of options to eat uptown so I would encourage the Va Piano  to work on their customer service.",

I assumed she was putting an order in or something, but I looked over and saw she had been playing a game on her phone. She gave us our cards and directed us to the ordering stations.  My wife enjoyed her pasta and bruschetta, my cobb salad was ok. My biggest issue is that lunch for 2 was $47 and we had no leftovers. We did order 1 glass of wine for $10 and 2 sodas, but wow, $47? And then when I went back up to Candy Crush girl to pay my bill I was given the option to tip? For what? You stand in line to order and then go back up to get your food.  Nice concept, but way overpriced. My salad was $12 plus $3 more for chicken. Probably won't go back.",

For those who have never been to Vapiano, upon arrival each patron receives a plastic card which you use to record all purchases.  When you go to the bar and order a drink, you give them the card and they record the drink on the card.  Later, you will use that same card when ordering your food.  At the end of the night you pay at the door by presenting your plastic card with all of the purchases and then use whatever method of payment you would like.  If you are taking care of someone else's meal or drinks, simply order it on your card or collect their card and present both cards when you are ready to pay.  Although a lot of activities were scheduled in the vicinity, it was raining very hard so that may have had something to do with the emptiness of the restaurant.  Much to our delight as we could sit anywhere we wanted and service was swift and on point.  I ordered Tagliatelle pasta with Alfredo sauce, spinach and mushrooms.  My son ordered Chicken Alfredo with Penne pasta.  Both of our meals were prepared with attention to detail and the server was pleasant and efficient.  The bartender put her special touch on the two drinks that I had and we tipped her well after.    The restrooms were as clean as the dining area and everything was well lit and well stocked.  Four thumbs up for Vapiano on a rain drenched night in Charlotte!",

    "text": "This was my second time visiting here in the past two years. Last year I was less impressed than this time. They seem to be making some improvements as my food tasted a lot better this time than my first visit. The concept of the restaurant is cool but could be improved. Be advised: If you're looking for a restaurant where you'll be waited on... THIS IS NOT IT. You'll be getting everything yourself from food to silverware to fountain drink. I sat next to a lady that complained about this the entire time. -___- Despite having to serve yourself they have made an improvement with the line and changed 5 cramped lines they didn't have space for into one line. I also wouldn't advise going in large groups as you'll probably be getting your food at different times. I gave them 4 stars despite the long wait in line for my food because the food is made to order and the pasta is made fresh in house(they have a pasta manufacturing room). My pasta was delicious, I had the shrimp limone with bell peppers instead of bacon and spaghetti pasta. The restaurant is not expensive so it's worth the try for fresh pasta, just know you'll need some patience.",

Yep that was the start of my night and how I ended up here. A great place might I add and even better people. I ordered chicken penne pasta with a side salad and bread. Snagged a single girl seat at the bar and watched the football game that was on .  I honestly was enjoying EVERY MOMENT solo, side note to my single ladies great place to grab great food and take yourself on a date! When I was leaving a someone tapped me on my shoulder and I giggled because I thought someone I knew had saw me... to my surprise I had no idea who this 6'10 guy was but he was huge and handsome! We spoke a little, chatted some more over the FREE gummy bears , exchanged contact information {I usually don't do this but I was feeling froggy} and we said good night.   So yes take that dinner to Vapianos... YOU'RE WELCOME!",

I wish we had such a concept here in PHX!  So many choices and options even for the most picky of palates. The food was cooked to order--which I love. The salads were fresh and tasty.  But like my hubby--I wish there was beverage service because it is a bit awkward to have to leave the table when dining with associates to refill a drink. This isn't McDonalds....  I do look forward to coming back during my next trip to Charlotte though!",

The atmosphere is light and bristling with a restrained temerity.  First timers will need to pay attention when they're greeted or they'll be lost.  You'll get a card that places all your purchases on it.  You go where you want, get what you want, and pay at the front when you're ready to leave.  You're a big boy...you can do it.  The food here is nice.  I've only had the pizza and salads and haven't been disappointed.  Every employee I've encountered had been more than helpful.  My only advice to Vapiano would be concerning the pizza condiments at the end of the pizza counter.  A spoon and a container of crushed red pepper make for a difficult experience when putting red pepper on your pizza.    Overall, Vapiano is bustling, fragrant, and a comfortable experience.  Give it a try.  I know I'll be back.",

Given that I don't work uptown, and coming uptown and trying to find parking around lunch is as frustrating as it is, Vapiano's, would never be be where I choose to ever go.  Anyways, been here twice. It is cafeteria style like all the other reviews mentioned and has a fun loungey but modern vibe. They, supposedly, and rather publicly, make their own pasta and grow all their herbs. Funny how they always seem to be pressing pasta and rolling herbs in the cart during lunch rush...speaking of lunch rush tables are hard to come by if you come right at noon. You are able to reserve them, though!  The portions are good but it is a little on the expensive side for the quality. I do enjoy the bread (served hot!) and love that they have oil and vinegar on the table for dipping.   I've gotten the caprese pizza and the turkey club panini and have been let me down both times. They just seem to skimp on the toppings and \"extras\" (see picture of turkey club with tiny bit of prosciutto). Lunch mate had maybe 4 olive slices on the whole damn pizza.  They only have a few panini options and no bread choices. The pasta and pizza menus are pretty size able, though. The side salad, which come with the paninis, is iceberg lettuce and they will not ask your dressing option.   Overall, like I said, this would never be somewhere I would choose to go given all the other many wonderful options in the area, but it's quick and they put on a pretty good show.",

The drill is, go to bar, scan your card order what you want and repeat this at each station (soup, salad, entree).  Very easy once you get the hang of it,  and a very fast way to get food.  Once we got our food and went to the table both my husband and I were very surprised at how good it was. I had pumpkin soup followed by pumpkin ravioli in butter sauce (yes, I love pumpkin).  It was excellent!!!  My husband had pesto spinach ravioli with tomato sauce which was also excellent.   The pasta was cooked perfect and the sauces were very tasty.  We enjoyed the meal with a carafe of their red sangria.  The sangria was as good as the sangria we got in Spain earlier this year.  Would highly recommend this place for great pasta.

It is a spacious venue with high ceilings, a variety of tables that are regular and high seating, and a large bar area.    The ordering system is great for groups looking to split checks - they give each person a card which is swiped with each food or drink order and you pay upon exiting.  They have a variety of offerings including pastas, sandwiches, appetizers, soup, salads, pizzas, and desserts.  The pasta portions are really big.  If you are a fan of banana pudding this one is good.    The sangria was kind of gross because it was almost sickeningly sweet.  I also tried a glass of montepulciano but was again disappointed.  While the food prices are reasonable the drinks prices for wines by the glass are a bit steep.  Service was fairly non-existent but that's not a huge issue when you wait for your food at each station and serve yourself drinks (including water and alcohol).",

But anyway, onto what really matters, the food. I went with the Toscana pizza. It was perfectly meh. Hailing from Chicago, I guess I'm spoiled with pizza that makes my brain want to explode with every bite. Vapiano's pizza was pretty okay. As a pizza connoisseur, pretty okay doesn't really cut it for me....so Vapiano's really didn't cut it for me. I suppose it's worth a try though, just because it's so different.",

We started off trying to get a bruschetta trio appetizer and were greeted with \"Hey man what do you want?\" from someone that I think was a manager, as he was dressed differently from the other cooks and wearing a white shirt. After a long wait, while the order taker stood around doing nothing we received the bruschetta and it was mediocre at best, bread not really toasted and soggy tomatoes.  We had pasta, which was good, not great. I do like the bolognese pasta dish and it was ok,The cook had a slightly better attitude, but not by much, at least this one smiled. Had a few drinks from the bar and again, not overwhelmed with hospitality.   Made the mistake of letting a co-worker talk me into going there for lunch today, THE LAST TIME ever. The food and service from everyone were so dismal and it feels like no one cares about being nice to the guest in front of them. Stand in line, wait for mediocre food and rude service, then stand in line again to pay. NO THANKS. Too bad it started out ok.",

You'll need a tray, so it's a cafeteria-style, with a twist. What I liked: They give you an e-card and menu at the door. Then, at the stations where you order your food, the cost is loaded onto your card and you pay at a central register. Speeds up ordering. Easy for separate checks, couples in a party of four or more or easy for one person to pick up the entire tab by grabbing all cards. Food was really good! LOVE the open \"air\" wall to Tryon Street. We sat on the patio in the middle of the Tryon Street sidewalk. Fun! Only minor complaint: I felt pressured to order fast (like on Seinfeld). Advice: hang back and decide what you want before stepping up to the counter to avoid that issue. Lots of stations, so look it all over first.",

Whereas here you do not have to fight for your place in line to get your ready cooked pasta, salad, or pizza, the reward is good, but not always very good. The cook staff is kind and attentive but struggles to prepare consistent dishes  (or know/remember the ingredients). Deserts are great although recently shrunk in size. Still Vapiano is a solid standby when craving fresh pasta, Euro atmosphere, good bread, and rich deserts. Self seating is easy and convenient, especially with larger groups.",

    "text": "recently dropped by the new Vapiano to grab a salad for lunch. Usually, I get the spinach salad with chicken ($9) at D&D across the hall from Vapiano or the the Grilled Tuna Asian salad ($9) from Arthur's. Both are large, hearty lunch salads that include lots of greens and protein. When I received the strawberry spinach salad from the kind person who made it, I opened it up to make sure there was something in there. Upon further inspection, the $3 extra I paid for chicken turned out to be seven dice-sized pieces on a bed of spinach with three strawberries, some pine nuts and four chunks of goat cheese. When checking out, I almost asked if I could return the salad for something less expensive when the total for just the salad was $14.98. Alas, I learned an expensive lesson that I should not return here for a salad. Perhaps I will try the pizza or pasta next time.",

Too bad they put so much thought on the looks and not the functionality.  They give you some crazy card with a magnetic strip on it to track your food and drink purchases, but dont tell you that there is no table service.  After a stressful day of work, the last thing that I want is to have to get up every time I want some water, beer, or food and go wait in some idiotic line that is only being serviced by one bar tender during happy hour.  And good luck trying to get drinks for other people at your table and then trying to remember who's card is whos.  If and when you finally get a drink, then you have to go wait in line again to pay!!  Give me a break with that crap.  Good luck in finding people in Charlotte that want to \"dine\" like Europeans on a regular basis.  At least who ever takes over that spot in a few months when this place tanks won't have too much redecorating to do.",

We tried this place despite some of the negative reviews and found it to be pretty good food, service, and ambience.  The pizza was just ok, but the ravioli did not disappoint.  I like the concept of fresh, made-to-order Italian food in center city CLT.  This is long overdue!  We went later on a Friday evening after a night on the town, so the place was not packed.  The concept of having to order your food/drinks at different serving stations was not bothersome to us at all.  However, I could see where this might be challenging to navigate during really busy times like the lunch rush.  CLT needs some diverse food alternatives downtown, so I hope this place gains traction.",

There was plenty of seating available in an open indoor style courtyard and the food stations were available with view, to watch your meal be prepared before your eyes!  It's a neat concept, where you receive a card upon entry to swipe your orders. The card alleviates the hassle of a waiter or waitress.  We decided to go for the Pasta station.  I was already geared on having the Scampi E Spinaci with Linguine pasta. I must say it was fairly good.  I felt that the Pancetta could have been left out of my dish.  My friend had the Chicken Alfredo which was pretty bland.  Extra Parmesan please! made it suitable.  We did not order pizza because the pasta and homemade bread was very filling.  Overall, Vapiano is great to go out with friends or have a nice date night. The interiors are modern and chic.  I especially liked the olive trees planted at some of the tables. Warning!! if you are a dessert eater please pass up the pre-made desserts, they did not look appetizing. I will definitely return to try the pizza.",

If you are with friends, you go up to lines (Salad, Pizza or Pasta) individually to order. If you want a salad and pizza, then that's two lines. Your guests are in other lines unless you want the same food. This mean the only time you socialize is while you are in line waiting to place an order. Needless to say, all the food does no come ready at the same time. So you and your guests may not eat together. Oh, you want a drink, that's ANOTHER line. You get it, you spend a lot of money to wait in line. This is NOT the american way. People want to be served and have dinner and drinks TOGETHER with friends not in phases. For the price, it's not worth the poor type of service.   AND the workers want tips will you are doing the serving. Hmmm  What gives!!",

On that note, we were told to seat ourselves, and that's about where the attention and service ended (even though we told the hostess this was our first time).  The basic concept is one of cafeteria-type stations: salad, pizza, pasta.  Each diner receives a tracking card to swipe at the chosen station once the order has been placed.  The menu is fairly large, so it's easy to find something to make everyone happy, but the extras and specialties are a bit hidden.  For example, I didn't realize I could add veggies to my marinara & mozzarella pasta until I overheard someone ordering next to me; additionally, only some people at my table were offered complimentary bread when they ordered.  Drinks were self-serve from the fountain machine in the back, but we had to ask one of the servers (who were few and far between) for glasses.  On the whole, the food was pretty good, but the level of service (or lack thereof) and total concept just didn't do anything for me.",

We tried the spicy orange salad, which was fine for a salad, but nothing special. The carbonara and pizza were excellent, and the prices were unexpectedly cheap. Coo. atmosphere too. Deserts are pre-made, at the bar, and we tried the white chocolate mouse, which was very good. Overall a great experience and highly recommended.

Trying to avoid humiliating my dining partner the next time I went, I politely declined the second card when I arrived and was chastised loudly with, \"EVERYONE HAS to have an individual card\". So as we leave... Guess what? \"Ma'am. You have to pay\". I'm done here. The chefs are slow, hard to understand (you're speaking over a counter in a crowded restaurant...stop murmuring), the service clearing tables is slow on busy nights, it's impossible to get help from wait staff to clear tables, and the hostess has accused me of theft for the last time.",

The service, however, makes this location worth missing. I have frequently waited 25+ minutes for a Caesar salad to go, and on two occasions, the man at the salad station forgot to make my food entirely. There was also one occasion where I ordered my dressing on the side, and the man at the counter told me he would not remake my salad (i.e. put lettuce in a different container and add crotons). Worth noting that this has been the same man every time. The food is ok, a bit overpriced for what you get, but if you are in a hurry, or value the correctness of your order, do not come here. I suggest the restaurant find someone new to work the salad counter ASAP!",

The food here is cooked and made to order so it's fresh.  My biggest \"like\" about the place is the interior.  Super chic, trendy and candy for my eyes!  It's got a very large interior that affords larger groups the ability to sit together easily.  Also they have lounge areas where you can really kick back and stay a while with a cold beer and thin pizza.  I'll always prefer eating and drinking in a comfy chair/couch.  Major brownie points here from me :)  The outdoor seating is great too, but a bit small and the bench seating just isn't as appealing to me.",

We were walking by and I snapped a photo when one of the employees came outside and starting talking to us and almost pulled us in - BOLD move!  Already being very skeptical (very picky about food and VERY, VERY when it comes to Italian or Pizza and Pizza)... Though as I've heard it said and agree, \"Fortune Favors the Bold\" - I admire those who will take a chance and be a little pushy or at least assertive to see if they can influence a \"Hard Sell\" like me!  So the guy shows us around and tells us how it works.  We had already been to Ri Ra, though decided to look around and were probably going back to Ri Ra, just wanted to explore more first. The big part of the pitch was \"fresh, fresh, fresh\", prices were right and we stayed - We had a Salami Pizza and bread.  The food and cook service was very good.  Yes we will go back!  The food and price were big pluses for us, though I'm not sure of the overall concept, especially the card swiping card part, it was no problem for us (two on one card and my friend payed for everything - Thanks if you are reading this) I'm not sure how others will accept the concept and self serve part.  The last song was Annie Lennox (Eurythmics) \"Sweet Dreams\" though \"Who's that Girl\" would have been more suited to the situation!",

When we walked in the Hostess informed us about the \"Cards\" that track everything you order, and that we just swipe it at the stations whenever u order something, and then when we are ready to leave we just bring it back to the Hostess to cash it out and pay. I have to say I quite enjoyed this concept. I guess in a way its kind of like a fancy Cafeteria, but I liked the whole concept. I ordered a Chicken Panini with side Salad and it hit the spot. The decor of the restaurant is cool and very zen with the Trees in the middle of the table. Will definitely be back to try it out again.... this place is great for lunch or for a cheap dinner.",

    "text": "Okay, so for ambience-  I gave this place stars.  BUT,  if this were just based on the food-  I would give no starts.  My husband is Italian and his father owned to traditional Italian restaurants in our home town.  That being said,  we still appreciate the modern twist to Italian too; however, this was neither.  They make their own pasta-  but it's is sticky, tastless and chewy.  It was aweful.  My husband and I both got pasta dishes and on both-  they cook forgot things that were supposed to be cooked into the pasta.  My huband got a spinach pasta,  the guy forgot to cook it in-  so his thought-  put the pasta from the plate back in the skillet,  add in the spinach and mix it around a couple of times.  Needless to say,  it was like cold raw spinach leaves with your hot pasta-- didn't really go.  The other thing-  no one is coming around and refilling drinks or taking your plates or bringing you your food-  so why would you have that massive clear box for tip money (right where the hostess is) when you go up to pay.  It just seemed tacky.   You can't have it both ways-  either you are like a deli where you order at the counter and get your food- or have someone come around and at least refill your drinks, bus your tables (which was not done) and making sure everything is okay.   I think this place has potential - but it just totally misses the mark.  The other thing-  if you want a drink-  you've go to go to the bar to order it,  then you have to go to this line for this,  then this line for that-  just doesnt make that much sense to me.",

    "text": "Last night before Alive After Five me and a couple friends went to Vapiano's for the first time. The place has a really cool vibe and was decorated really nicely so I was pretty excited. However, my excitement waned after I waited in the pasta line for about 15 minutes. When it was finally my turn to order, I asked for the Salmon and Dill Pasta Special, the man cooking looked at me and said they were out of salmon and if i had a second choice...I hesitated because I was pretty set on that dish, after seeing my distress he told me he was just kidding, and proceeded to fix my pasta. While he was making it he asked me to swipe my card, which I did. About ten minutes later my pasta was finished and and asked if I had already swiped my card, and i told him I had.Then he tells me that he doesn't bleive me and keeps telling me to swipe. I thought he was joking because he had joked about the salmon earlier and of course i didn't want to get charged twice. I eventually found he was, in fact, not joking so I swiped my card again and it revealed I had already done it like I told him. I was not too fond of being called a liar...  Anyway, the pasta was great! my friends pizza was kind of burnt but that was still good. And their complimentary bread is nothing special.   If you want shorter wait times and a kinder staff I would definitely recommend going elsewhere, I will certainly not be returning.",

Great food most of the time (Chicken Alfredo pasta and pizza are delicious most of the time - look for Pierre as he is the best chef I've had and always consistent), good prices, especially for Uptown Charlotte, large portion sizes.  When you leave, Gummy Bears are handed out - the unfortunate thing is for some reason they do not have gummy bears every day.  On one visit I asked a server why the gummy bears are so inconsistent and he replied \"we just didn't have time to make them\".  In my opinion, such a unique and great ending to a meal should not be overlooked - especially when the quality of food or attitudes of the servers can be so inconsistent.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, the service has declined significantly in the last year. While I still like the food, the chefs are ridiculously slow, sometimes bad tempered and seemingly uncaring about the growing line waiting to order while they slowly stir and chat with each other. I have walked out numerous times after waiting an unreasonable amount of time.   If it takes 10 minutes or more for them to cook your meal after you've ordered, it's really annoying to stand around for 20 minutes just waiting to order. Management needs to keep a closer eye on staffing as well as demeanor of the staff, as I know plenty of business people who won't go here because of these issues.  It doesn't seem reasonable for only one pasta chef station to be open with 5+ people in line waiting to order, and yet there are many other employees cleaning stations and prepping to leave.   Despite those annoyances, the pasta is still amazing when I do decide to wait around for it. My standard order: carbonara with onion, garlic, Serrano peppers, sundried tomatoes and oven roasted tomatoes. It's amazing every time.   I would come more often if management would resolve the problematic staffing or ordering issues.",

It seems like the downtown needs a shot in the arm, and I would suggest Vapiano as a great place to come down to start your evening.  The pasta is build your own or select from the suggestions.  I had the tagliatelle with bolognese and a side caesar salad.  Everything was really tasty but I think I will order a little differently next time.  Not quite Calzone's but a good fast Italian.  They claim the pasta is made on site daily, and you can tell; the taste is much better and the pasta isn't slimy like packaged pasta.  I liked the \"credit card\" style of paying for the meal and being able to go to the stations.  Real plates and flatware, and a very stylish (and large) interior seating area.",

At first, I was a little confused because I didn't really know how it worked, but I went to the bar got a drink and gave them the card.  Inside, it was very decorative and lots of places to sit. I took a picture of one of the neat tables with the tree in the middle. It gave a feeling of zen within the restaurant. The surrounding tables are a little small, but its nothing to worry about because there are big tables as well. I can see how it could be busy during the day, but I went on a Friday night and there wasn't that many people.   I ordered the Pasta Cognac which I believe was a special that night. It was pretty tasty, but I wished the portion was a little bit bigger. I believe that was my fault because I got the Linguini instead of the other style of pasta, and there were cheaper options with more food. They have a wok and they cook it right in front of you. They also give you free bread, so make sure to get some. Swipe your card and you're off to eat!  I didn't get to try the pizza, however I did drink. Nice 3 long islands as well as a couple of shots for the birthday girl. And, major props to the bartender as he made my long islands pretty strong and tasty. They tend to put a lot of ice in them, so for the second and third one I told them not to put so much ice and a little more of the sour mix and coke.  On an off topic, in the bathroom there are some awesome hand drying machines. And they have a schedule of the artists that come in every Thursday and Friday night that play live music. If you come, come on one of those nights to enjoy nice music to go along with your food and drink.",

Food looked appetizing but fell flat. We were all starving and yet we didn't finish anything. Very acidic red sauce and just not tasty at all. Took home all the left overs. Then tossed in the trash this morning after all 3 of us complained of feeling sick all night long. Never going back!!",

After you slide the card, you can basically awkwardly watch them cook your food; this is the time to ask for additional stuff or to make sure to leave out stuff.  I have noticed that certain cooks tend to be more above-and-beyond than others, while some may have an off day and your food could be just better; so its best if you frequent here to get to know the cook a little bit to improve your food.  Generally, the pasta is pretty good, though I wasn't that happy with the calzone I got once (was cold inside, while hot outside).  During lunch time it can get really busy as people wait in line to be served; the bar area is mostly empty at this time, plenty of seating.  Televisions are the bar area usually on sports.  Pay as you leave with the card you used to order your meal; the price tag is higher than average lunch fair, so spend accordingly.  Overall, it's okay... as some failings that can be better, but still worth a go.",

    "text": "Vapiano has an attractive and open seating layout which sparked my interest and led me to try heavier Italian food instead of lighter alternatives for lunch. The menu offers the favorites including pastas, pizzas, salads, and soups. The food is prepared in plane view in-front of you which allows for the option to exclude any ingredients should you prefer it.  There is no Wow factor which would differentiate Vapiano's menu from other Italian eateries. I would describe the taste, creativity, and quality of food as generic. The portions are large but serve little benefit since the lacking taste leaves little appetite to finish it all.  You are provided a card which records your order history. The transaction is completed when you deposit the card to the cashier along with a payment type. I find the process to be unnecessarily cumbersome. Overall Vapiano's is one convenient option in Uptown Charlotte however the quality of food and the complexity of completing a transaction earns Vapiano's at most a third or fourth back up option.",

I have to say at first the whole place was a tad intimidating to say the least!!! That said after a lil intro to how everything worked there it was all good!! Once past the learning curve we found an open table to place our drinks then on to the \"line\" to place food orders. There are many different items offered on the menu as well as the ability to pick and choose items to add or leave off. The portions are huge and very worth the menu prices. The only downside I see is there are no servers or anyone to obtain another drink or any other item once you are away from the food line or bar. It has an upscale cafeteria type feel that you have to tip. That said we will certainly be back and have been twice since our first visit, it's that good!!!!",

    "text": "Working in Uptown Charlotte has its perks of the convenience and endless options for lunch. Still being a newbie to the area, I'm constantly open to suggestions. My colleague suggested Vapiano so I said \"absolutely, I'd love to try it!\"  On a Thursday at 12:30 during the lunch time rush, this place was packed. I don't expect anything less in a city. This cafeteria style Italian eatery has options of paninis, pizza, salad, homemade pasta, risotto and much more. The longest line there was for the pasta/risotto dishes, which I felt took longer then it actually needed to. Given all the pasta is made fresh daily, it had to be worth the wait.   I had ordered the specialty risotto (Risotto De Zucca) which consisted of pumpkin, zucchini, white onion, pumpkin cream sauce with white wine, and other ingredients which really tied the dish together. While there was communication and confusion behind the counter, my food did eventually make its way into my stomach.  This risotto was made to order, gluten free and fan-freaking-tastic! It's rare for me to completely eat a plate clean, but that day it happened.   Prices were very reasonable as well. My number one recommendation would be do not go here during lunch is you are limited on time. It doesn't take longer at the pasta station.",

Vipiano, Olio = oil, try using some.  The dish smelled of garlic but it had no flavor other than spicy.   Additionally, I requested grated cheese, they added it to the dish which only helped to cement the noodles together.  It was very funny to have to cut the dish into squares.   Just cause a meal is delivered doesn't mean you can drop your standards, at least I hope the standards were dropped and this dish isn't the norm.",

Love their new rope system for the pasta line. Keeps the lines flowing and the food comes out relatively fast.  Vapiano's pastas are made daily and kept in their own container. Pastas are cooked al dente. Salads  are fresh and full of flavor. The complementary french baguette in the inside it's moist and it has the perfect crunch on the outside.   I would love for the \"host\" to be friendly. You can tell they don't enjoy their job and sadly it's reflects on the way their interact with the customers.

    "text": "I came here over the weekend with a large group as part of a pizza crawl for a friends birthday. Many of them have never been to a Vapiano's before, but the women working at the front were very helpful in explaining how it works.   If you've never been here's how it works. There are no servers. When you get there someone up front gives you a card. This is how you order. You then go up to the counter for whatever you want to order (pasta, pizza, salad), order, and tap your card on a machine. This adds your food to your tab. If you're getting pasta or salad you wait up there and get your food right away. If you're ordering pizza they typically give you a number and they'll bring your pizza out when it's ready. There's also a full bar that also serves coffee and dessert. You order the same way over there. You can sit wherever you want. Then on your way out stop at the cashier at the front, they'll scan your card, and you pay and tip up there. Pretty easy!  There were a lot of events going on Uptown that day, so it was pretty crowded, but we were able to push together some tables so we could all sit together. We ordered three pizzas to split. We were told it would be about 45 minutes. We weren't in a rush so we went over to the bar. I got a latte and a few other people got beers. Prices were pretty much what you would expect for drinks Uptown.   We hung out for a while - our pizzas definitely took longer than 45 minutes  to come out. When they did one of them was wrong, but the chefs were quick to bring us out the right pizza. For the price I was hoping that the pizza would be a little better. I've been to another Vapiano's location before and got their pasta which is amazing!",

    "text": "Ordered today via Postmates for delivery to my office:  I've always loved Vapiano, but today I just NEEDED pasta... so I got the pesto y spinachi with shrimp and linguini and it was wonderful!  It got to me hot, they included the bread, all the details I ordered were perfectly correct.  The thing is... I love this place... you can get what you like from a caprese salad to a pizza... they make their own pasta (which is delicious), and the concept of the place really does remind me of lunch cafeterias I've been to in Italy... It's \"like\" fast food... but it's NOT fast food... it's a freshly made-to-order delight, and though I don't eat here often (or I'd have to buy bigger pants), I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!",

You basically take the card, go thru a line, and order what you want, and they bill the card for you to pay after you get done. Ok method, I guess, but the workers assume you know what you're doing, and give you a hard time for being a rookie. Frustrating experience.",

The pasta line can get long so go ahead and wait in line and then decide what you want while waiting in line if you know you definitely want pasta! I decided with the shrimp scampi. The pancetta with it added a nice touch. I also added jalapenos to give it a kick. Shrimp was cooked well and the amount of pasta they give you is a good size. I added crushed red peppers to it and it was perfect!! It also comes with some bread. Overall, I was happy with my order. It would be hard to not order something else next time!",

The cards that each customer gets to order are great when you go with a group of friends and you don't have to split the bill because everyone essentially has their own tab.  Over the last few years that I've lived in uptown I've tried a lot of different foods Vapiano offers everything taste great; salads, pasta, pizza, the customer service however is hit or miss. The hostesses are always nice and welcoming but some chefs behind the glass are very rude. Also when you're paying look for the gummy bear container, they have little to go cups if you'd like to take gummy bears with you :)",

    "text": "(2.5/3) For first timers, this 'restaurant' is organized a lot like a high-tech, italian-only food court. Walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert). It's convenient and not too crowded. Apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time.   I ordered the Pasta Vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9.95). It was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies. However, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air. The pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor. LIke past reviewers, I also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup). Serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be). My friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. \"The anchovy flavor was great.\" I also got the trio of bruschetta ($4.50) and white chocolate mousse ($2.75) to go.   Finally, I had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when I went to check out. Fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check. Overall, I would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly. It's also a great alternative to fast food and traditional sit-down restaurants.",

Also, the pizza maker gave me my pizza in an overly sized box, and seeing no servers around I didn't know what to do with it after I'd finished eating since there are no visible trash cans in the establishment. Then, when I had to go to the restroom before I checked out, a server came to ask if there was anyone in the bathroom because his manager asked because they didn't want anyone stiffing on their bill. Being that I was the only adult person in the bathroom at that time, I thought that was really rude and offensive. I proceeded to pay and tipped Ok, but this place is awkward and thankfully as I don't live in Charlotte and was only here for layover, will not be dining here again.",

    "text": "What. a. bummer.  Having ordered the underwhelming panini last time, I was kinda excited to try their pasta.  But that dish, as well, was meh.     I ordered the aglo e olio, which is a basic pasta dish.  Generally, it's spaghetti with garlic and olive oil, and one can dress it up a little with parsley, chili flakes, or whatever.  I rarely put anything else - especially, since I heard that their pasta is all made in-house.  Pure pasta and nothing to hide its integrity - yum... or not.  I thought homeboy had whipped up my dish a little too quick, and that was the case.  The spaghetti was undercooked and clumped together.  There I was trying to talk shop with some folks, and my lunch was difficult to eat.  Instead of normal bites of pasta, or trying to be high-class/fancy/sophisticated and getting nice spoonful portions of spaghetti together, it looked like I was trying to eat golf divots - just massive clumps.  I gave up after awhile as it no longer looked nor tasted particularly appetizing.    Kinda relieved that our monthly lunch meetings are no longer going to be here.  It's for the best - some of us that order paninis get an alert thing so they can sit at the table and retrieve their panini when ready, while some of us have to stand at the pasta station until the food is ready.  Enough lost time that it's inconvenient when ordering different types of dishes.    For those reason, three stars becomes two stars. Vapiano, if you're looking for more stars, they might just be buried in that mess of a spaghetti dish!  dmo out",

    "text": "TASTY PASTA FOR DECENT PRICE AND LARGE SERVING!  My friend and I were on a business trip in Charlotte and without knowing anywhere to go, decided on Vapiano for lunch. The restaurant is an interesting concept - each person is given a plastic card to keep track of their meal purchases and you pay on your way out. It's simple, convenient and you don't have to fuss with divvying up a bill if you are with a large party. I only went here once and here's what I have to say about my experience:  1) FOOD (4/5): I ordered the CHICKEN ALFREDO (Chicken Breast, Cream Sauce, Parmesan) with Rotini noodles. The PASTA IS FRESH - they open up an individual size serving and mix it up with the sauce and chicken in a wok like mixing bowl. The PORTION SIZE WAS HUGE - easily enough for 2 meals. I don't know why I decided to try and eat the whole bowl...I was stuffed for the rest of the day. The sauce was CREAMY and there was enough of it to coat the noodles. I also had 2 slices of bread which were also SOFT and FRESH. There's olive oil and vinegar on the table. My total was less than $9.00 - SO INEXPENSIVE! My only complaint is the toward the end of my dish, the pasta got kind of sticky.  2) SERVICE (3/5): Nice, pleasant work staff. A woman came to clear our trays.  3) ATMOSPHERE (3/5): This is THE PLACE TO GO if you're working in the area. The place was so busy around lunch time, but not sooo busy that we had to wait in line long. My friend and I had to wait in line behind 1 person who was ordering - so really, not bad at all. The inside is like this clean, sleek cafeteria with nice interior and different areas to sit - high table, low table, on a bench or sit on a chair.   BOTTOM LINE: I RECOMMEND this place to anyone in the area who is looking for GOOD, CHEAP FOOD! It's a nice clean restaurant and would definitely go back. After looking at their website, they have a Vapiano is Boston but the prices are more expensive! :(  * check out the food and interior pics I posted *",

    "text": "NOTE TO READERS:  I am now an employee of this location and have added some more detailed information that I will keep up-to-date  After dining at Vapianos a few times, I have settled with four stars.  If you are looking for an Italian style lunch/dinner casual/business casual lounge than look no further.      With an elegant yet modern full service bar and 5-10 minute food service, Vapianos is the perfect hangout spot for a quick bite or for a few hours of conversation.  Here you can find a decent selection of pasta combinations, as well as pizza, soup, salad, a bar, and dessert.  The food is excellent, but what really makes this place is the ambience.  The food is self-service or cafeteria style which is ideal when dining with a group of friends or family.  Each person receives a credit card that allows them to purchases drinks and food as they wish without the need for flagging down a server.  The average meal price ranges from 7.95-15.95, and the bar offers all that you would expect from a slightly upscale bar.    All pasta and dough used in the store is freshly made in the restaurant each day.  Some of the spices used in the dishes are also grown inside Vapiano.  You can find different herbs growing on each table in the restaurant.  This is one of the few places in charlotte you can find authentic Italian pizza and pasta and is going on my list of best places to dine in Charlotte.  Vapianos is a neat place that is worth a try and is practical on any budget.  They even have German gummy bears available to all guests at the host station!  Parking:  -Vapianos does not validate or offer valet -street parking is available for two hours/free on weekends or after six pm  -plenty of garages around the area (avrg. price: $5,00)",

There aren't traditional servers. To order you go to one of the stations to order your selection and then take a pager, which is how they notify you your order is ready. There is also a bar for wine, cocktails and deserts.   On my First visit I had the carbonara pasta which was delicious.   Second visit had the shrimp Alfredo. The Alfredo sauce was made freshly so it took a little longer than my prior pasta experience. I believe my server may have been newly hired. The flavor was as powerful as the carbonara. I was bit disappointed with the tiny shrimp.  Third visit had the salmon Cesar salad. The Cesar dressing is very good and is freshly made in the restaurant. The portion of salmon was small to my surprise. Overall worth having again.   Finally I had the Americana pizza which was the best meal by far. Fresh, fresh, fresh! The sausage were very flavorful, it had a nice sauce and the a nice thin crust.   This place has become a favorite that I frequent at least 2 times a week.",

The pizza was so so, not cooked enough as the middle was very pale and a bit soggy. Lasagna was fine, not a lot of flavor but ok. Carbonara was far from. Authentic but tasty, of all the dishes this is the one I'd choose again.   All and all, a chill vibe, quick easy meal, and decent food, but nothing to write home about.",

When you leave you pay a cashier that is stationed close to the door.   Vapiano's menu has expanded but the flavor has not. I ordered the Crema Di Funghi. It wasn't flavorful at all. It was tolerable. I added some salt and was able to consume most of the dish without complaint. My friends Pasta Bolognese however was not edible. It tasted just like canned tomato pasta. She forced herself to eat a couple bits but unfortunately threw the whole dish away. Since there is no wait staff there was no one to ask her how her meal was and she's not the type to complain or make a stink especially when in a large group.  Overall the whole group concluded that the taste and value of the entrees at Vapiano has greatly decreased. We were a group of about 15 people. I'm pretty sure we won't be back. Charlotte has too many restaurants to come back to ones that aren't flavorful.   Vapiano  201 S Tryon St Charlotte, NC 28202 Friday June 28, 2019 8pm",

I ordered through Postmates tonight and well some of my side sauces were damaged and arrived opened spilling all over the napkins and utensils.  The bread was not cut right for my bruschetta order was cut like you were slicing a loaf of bread not like an open face like it should be for this dish.  It was also not toasted right it was still cheery not really crunchy which it should have been.  You have to put tomato mix and the pesto I ordered on the bread and you can't when cut this way.  Means staff not trained well.  Also the pesto sausage pasta I ordered was very over cooked and gummy along with being dry at same time.  Not a good combo and did. It have much taste.  I added olive oil to it along with salt, pepper it did not help much.  My driver was caught in some traffic but that should not have been an issue if meal was cooked correctly.  The portions were plentiful which is good but in the end I ate the bread dipping my bread in what I could of my tomato mix and I ate a few bites of my pasta and then threw it out! I paid about $15 for the pasta and will not order from them again.  This was not a good experience and quite disappointing when hungry and very tired from a long day.  Postmates did give me a refund for the item that was opened and spilled which I appreciate so thank you Postmates you get a good rating from me but Vapiano sorry you do not.",

You can go to whichever station you want (pizza, pasta, etc.), order the food you want, and pay at the door whenever you leave. The stations have glass screens which allows you to watch the chefs make your food in front of you! They also have devices at each station that vibrates whenever your food is done.   I ordered a side Caesar salad and a prosciutto pizza. The salad came out quickly but the pizza took a while to come out. The chef also didn't seem to pleased to be there, but I appreciated his effort. The Caesar salad was simple, but it BLEW me away! It was fresh, filled with homemade croutons, and the dressing was soooo good. The pizza was good, but I wasn't the biggest fan of how charred it was. I was too full for dessert, but they had a case in the front with cake slices and tiramisu. I'm looking forward to going back to Vapiano! I would go back just for the salad!",

Vapiano provides a lot of food, but one thing to note is that they do not provide a good noodles to protein ratio. You will for sure get full from all of the carbs, but if you are looking for a meat with a decent amount of meat, then you should go somewhere else.",

When you walk in the hostess greets you and gives you a card similar to a debit card.  You stand in line and when you get to the station where you select your food, you give the card to the chef who then takes your order and enters on the card what you ordered.  You pick up your food, dine and then give the card to the hostess who knows how much to charge you.  How neat!!  The meal - yum!  I had chicken Alfredo with penne. The pasta was freshly made, the Alfredo was the right consistency with ample amounts of cheese and the bread was nice and crusty. The portion could easily be for lunch and dinner but it was so good I finished mine!!    Even though it was lunch time I had a great experience. The fresh herb plants and oil and vinegar on each table is a nice touch.  They also have a full bar which I didn't notice until my way out.    Highly recommend. Definitely going again!",

    "text": "We were a little skeptical about trying this place due to the 3.5 star Yelp rating, especially since it was directly contradictory to the word of mouth we had heard.  Everyone we knew who had tried Vapiano loved it!  Raving on and on about the fresh made pasta, well cooked meat and made-to-order counter style service, they would always recommend Vapiano for an Italian place in uptown.    We knew we had to try it.    Upon walking into Vapiano, I was very impressed by the interior.  Very large, modern and incredibly spacious.  Like, seriously.  Rent here must be insane, the kind of table capacity they have is crazy for what I must imagine does a large amount of take-out business.  The tables are beautiful and offer a very comfortable fine-in experience.    I went for the Pasta Marinara and meatballs, while my fiance went for the the All'Arrabiatra with Italian sausage (spice level 4/5).   I was impressed!  The meal starts with delicious crusty sourdough bread, with oil, vinegar and chili oil.  While nothing that is anything new, the pasta is delicious (as it should be made from hand, which you can see them do through the transparent glass), the sauce is excellent and the meat is very well-cooked.  I would definitely go for the All'Arrabiatta with spicy Italian sausage, as the dish is significantly more flavorful than the pasta marinara with meatballs, which sports a very solid tomato sauce but not much else.    The price point is amazing (~$10-12 per entree) and the card-paying system is very convenient; they give you a card when you walk in that you swipe at the various ordering station which accumulates your tab.  Upon leaving, you pay up front, causing minimum hassle during your actual meal.   Vapiano was a very neat experience and somewhere I'll definitely keep in mind.",

It is cafeteria style where you get to customize your own pasta and pizza. I have yet to have a bad experience here or bad food. I really enjoy creating my own dishes and thus having a different experience each time. The inside is very large and they have an outside patio as well, so it is great for big groups and special occasions. The atmosphere is more for a 21+ crowd, but feel free to bring children along as well. It is fast service, so great for lunch, but also gives a normal dining experience unlike fast food places. I would definitely come back.",

The food was good however the operation was not productive for a busy Friday night, on top of that the staff at the front were extremely rude (Kierra). Also they don't accept reservations if you plan to make them the day of.  Food : B+ , I had the Scampi Limone, Bruchetta Beverages : classic bottled beverages, a full bar.  Staff : F, Extremely Rude, Kierra working, at night, 03/09/2018 was extremely rude making several smart and sarcastic remarks, even when I asked for her to spell her name she told me to \"sound it out\", I escalated my concerns to the manager who stated birthday patrons usually get a small desert, however when I told the staff earlier no one eluded to this.  Service & Time : F , I was intrigued by the concept to place your order directly to the cook, however after standing in a line for 20 minutes this it became a hassle. Especially when staff you stand at the front and do nothing have attitude for no reason.  Layout & Design : A , This location has plenty of seating, a great bar area a large TV. Definitely a very relaxing place.",

    "text": "Think fast casual Italian, but it's actually really delicious. It's perfect for when you want to get in and out quickly.   The setup is a little different. When you walk in, you'll get a card. Then there's several stations for pizza, paninis, salad and pasta. You take the card to whichever station you want and they add it to your tab. Same goes for drinks which are in a separate area.   What I like about the stations is you can see everything being cooked in front of you. I've had just about everything here and honestly have liked everything, but the pasta is probably my favorite. There's plenty of sauces and pasta options so you can really customize it.   If you come for lunch which is when I'm most often there, it can get busy. On those days, the pizza and panini lines are a little faster.   Overall it's good quality and most of the time pretty fast.",

When you walk in you are given a card that scans when you order food throughout the restaurant and then pay when you leave with that card.   You can have make your own custom pizza and pasta. They make everything in front of you and you can select from a pre fix menu of recommendations or make your own. They also have a bar with a selection of beers and cocktails.   I personally enjoy their pasta more then their pizza, but everything I have had there is great. Next time I would ask for the pizza to be more well done. They have a very large dining room where I have never had an issue finding seating. Sometimes there may be a wait for your food, but it is worth it! I have never tried their dessert, but it looks good.",

    "text": "Considering this restaurant is located directly below my office, I've never partaken in a meal here until the other day.  Literally, I was a \"kid in a candy store\" and was amazed by their setup here.  Almost cafeteria-esq style, you walk in, get greeted by the hostess/greeter person and he/she will give you a plastic card.  Depending on what you would like to eat for that meal, you walk up to the counter and order.  Place your card on the \"magic\" slot device and the put the item you are about to receive on it and you pay the cashier on the way out.  Kinda genius if you think about it.  Less waiters (they still bus the tables for you) and the tables are first come-first serve.  I think my favorite part of this place is that they make their pasta in-house.  Even have a room dedicated to it.  During my lunch, I totally watched a guy make pasta from scratch and then put it through a machine.  Rotini was being made at that particular time.  I ordered from the pasta station and the chef?/line cook was super nice.  I think he could tell I was a newbie, and was patient with me.  Deciding on the Smoked Salmon Carbonera... the started making my lunch right in front of me.  In about 7-8 min... I had a delicious, steaming bowl of pasta presented before me.  My buddy had a salad which involved a beeper (so will have to try that next time).  And their pizza's look pretty awesome too.  The restaurant space itself is modern with clean lines, but warm woods and decorated with small herb plants.  Each table has its own oil, salt, pepper, balsamic.  I tried to take it easy on the bread, but it was too hard to resist.",

All the guest really enjoyed their food and the concept which made it much easier than splitting checks when in a large group. We all had various things from various stations however my family and I have been back several times and tried different stations and our favorite items (The husband and I ) come from the Salad and Pasta station, however our teenagers like the Pizza bar. The food is extremely FRESH and full of flavor and it's okay to speak with your cook and ask them to add a little more of something or less of something to customize it for your liking. I also look to them for the proper pasta selection when choosing dishes since they know may flow better. I enjoy my time there each visit, I only had one issue when dining that I won't go into because it was rectified which is why this is a 4 star rating.",

I asked for a plastic cup to grab water and I was told go to the bar to get a glass cup right after they gave someone else a plastic cup to get water. The woman told the other guest \"you must get water\" as if she was going to steal. They should have been consistent on what they tell customers when getting water don't offer one person plastic and tell me walk to the bar. The part that bothered me the most was I asked for bread and we were told they were out for the night. Crazy thing is there was bread on the counter behind the cooking station. We had more guest arrive that asked for bread and were told the same thing ...... a guy walks up to a different cook and asks for bread and he gave him bread immediately . My friend goes up to ask for bread AGAIN and was finally given bread after being told there wasn't any. This really upset me, it's just bread but please be consistent with what you tell guest or I will have to assume there was a reason you gave someone else of a different race bread and not us. Lastly, the Birthday boy and his date sat down to eat and their pastas were mixed up. They took it back up there to be made and weren't offered any compensation for the time wasted and issue. They sat down to eat their food again and realized it still wasn't right ! I usually enjoy Vapiano which Is why I suggested we have the birthday dinner there bringing Vapiano business but I'm highly DISAPPOINTED. I would not suggest coming back after this experience.",

    "text": "A friend recommended this place to me. Very cool and yummy place! The ambiance and decor is REALLY nice. This restaurant has a cool concept... its like walking into a school lunch room cafeteria. There are different food stations that offer pastas, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. You go to the station you want and order and scan a plastic card, then you take a buzzer and go sit and wait for your food. The tables are high top wooden benches. They also have a loungey bar and dessert area. After you order and get your meal and eat, as you are leaving you pay at the register at the door. SO COOL! Food was really good too. I had a margherita pie and garden salad. Wasnt really a margerita since it didnt have fresh mozzarella but tasty none-the-less!  Just wish they had more food options! Would definitely come back next time i am in Charlotte.",

    "text": "This place is pretty cool! I have visited the other location in Chicago and I'm in love. After moving to Charlotte, I'm very excited that they have another location here. Vapiano is not a typical Italian restaurant where you can sit and are served, but you walk in and sit and the staffs will hand a contact chip card. I need to admit that the ordering process might be a little confusing if it is your first time. The thing is you go to different stations and order. They have pizzas, salads, pastas, and sandwiches. They've also got a full-service bar, beer on tap and bottled soda. Unfortunately, there are no waitstaff, you just got to get up and do it yourself.   The atmosphere is very relaxing and clean. Very cool place. High ceiling with good decor. Service was fast and the staffs were friendly. I ordered the basil pasta with linguini, yes it was spicy but pretty good. Pasta is a must try. I have had scampi which is great. You can select which kind of pasta and choose the level of spiciness. Pizza has a  very light crust and tastes good.  Highly recommend if you are looking for quick service, inexpensive prices, great atmosphere, and delicious food.",

I expected to notice some differences in the atmosphere and food, but thankfully it was all the same.   The food is made to order right in front of you. Which is great because you customize each dish to your liking. You also know that hot food you are eating is fresh and not some pre-made microwaved dish. The portions are large, so I would suggest sharing a dish if you aren't super hungry or just looking for a small bite in the middle of a work day.",

    "text": "Vapiano's really fell off the cliff in quality between my first visit about a year ago and my visit last week.  The place was \"trendy\" as others have mentioned about a year ago, but on this visit everything looked very cheap or maybe just worn.   The food was the same story.  The two of us ordered a Caprese Salad, an Alfredo dish, and Gorgonzola pizza.    The Caprese was nice except they use sliced cherry tomatoes instead of slicing a nice beefsteak tomato or something similar.  The mozzarella was really good and fresh.    The Alfredo dish took a VERY long time to make.  They also didn't offer a buzzer to come pick it up when it was ready like they did the pizza.  We were forced to stand there for 15 minutes while it was completed, which is excessive.  The pasta was nice, but the sauce had that fresh out of a can that was sitting on the shelve for months taste.  The Gorgonzola pizza was extremely bland.  Again, the crust was nice, but the sauce had zero taste.  That is almost impossible with Gorgonzola cheese - but it happened.  The wine list was extremely cheap - most bottles topped out at $27 total.  There was a reason though, the wine was box quality stuff.  I am all for making it cheap and fun but there wasn't even one \"better\" option.    I don't think I will be going back any time soon.  The total bill wasn't that cheap that I can overlook the flaws in the food/service.",

Upon entering, the host gave us a card and explained how the whole restaurant worked. You take your card up to the station you want (they are labeled) and order. From there, they scan your card and give you a little beeper to tell you when your food is ready. There are two bars, one at the front and one at the back where the same card concept applies. I ordered the bruschetta pizza and antipasti plate while the other people in my party ordered pasta carbonara and a chicken panini (can't remember exactly what kind). With your meal, they give you bread and there is oil and balsamic at the table. Overall, food was very good and I loved the atmosphere. The only issue I saw with the whole thing was that people could walk out without paying for their meal. I even asked the woman checking me out how they dealt with that and she didn't have an answer or solution to it yet. Definitely worth trying because it's pretty good Italian food that's fast!",

The price for the pasta (skipping the meat) is pretty good. It's actually pretty fast.  Things I don't like: The pizza... It takes too long and its not worth the cost or the wait. The card system is a bit irritating. The way they make you wait in line.  I would not recommend this place for dinner - unless its a weeknight and you know what you are buying.  Some facts about me: I can't comment on the salad because I haven't tried it. I have been here 3 times. 1st i tried the Pizza - then I switched to the pasta and haven't looked back. I love home made pasta with any sort of fresh made from scratch sauce.  Cheers!",

I also love the feel of the restaurant- especially the \"fresh herb garden\" in the middle of the seating area.   Like several other reviewers, I also have had experiences with the staff being less than thrilled to take my order- but never to the point where they are rude or intolerable. I think for the size of the restaurant the managers are doing a good job motivating and coaching the line cooks.   Almost every time I've gone to Vapiano I have ordered some type of pasta dish. They have been consistently hot, fresh and tasty. I personally prefer more seasonings on my food and the staff were happy to oblige. Would definitely recommend Vapiano for anyone looking for a unique, modern twist on Italian food.",

The hostess then explained that you go to a personal chef station and he will put your order on the card, which you then bring back when you are done to check out.  Interesting...  The space is huge.  Wide open and very airy with apparently 100 year old olive trees and herb plants in terra cotta pots scattered about.  The furniture is very mod yet natural feeling for the space as well.  There are several lines form at the long kitchen and they are designated with their specialty (pizza, antipasta, salad, pasta) above on the chalkboard mural.  To quote Tom Petty, \"the waiting is the hardest part.\"  If you find yourself behind someone in the pasta line, as I did, you can expect to stand there for at least fifteen minutes.  But in the waiting, you realize that this isn't just someone with a vat of noodles and a big pot of sauce.  You can see into a back room just passed the kitchen that they make all their pasta in house, which they put into serving size containers that they personal chef then cooks.  And you have your choice of pasta.  I chose my sauce, sausage e verdure, to add to penne.  My friend has scampi e spinach with tagliatelle.  I thought it was neat that the pasta was put into an almost timed deep frier (only with boiling water) set up to cook.  We were able to stand and converse as our food cooked, occassionally answering ingredient questions.  A little garlic, throw in some spice, et cetera.  Our personal chefs were personable and quite capable.  This was gourmet pasta at its best.  The vegetables and sausage were delicious and the pasta was perfect.  Jen is a what I would consider a foodie, and we were both thoroughly impressed.  They also give you some delicious bread with oils on each of the tables.  Getting drinks wasn't inherently clear as far as the process.  But they have a full bar at the front which looks well appointed and is surrounded by inviting lounge seating between the bar and kitchen.  I will definitely be back when I have more time.  This would be an awesome spot for dinner before an uptown show or drinks after.",

My thoughts:  Customer Service: I had great service from when I approached the hostess stand to leaving the establishment. Very important in my book! Even the cooks (as you watched them prepare your food) were smiling and friendly.   Food: You do have to pick up a tray and grab food (think cafeteria) but nothing about the food will take you back to your high school days. It's prepared on the spot and the pizza (surprise, surprise) I had was okay. Not the best I have had but not the worse either.   Atmosphere: Great for lunch. It's huge and if the set up was any different it would look almost too big and uninviting. I would love to see what this place looks like at night. It is family friendly during the day--and would be a great place for a birthday celebration--esp. if you can grab one of the huge tables with a tree planted in the middle. I think this would be a nice date spot.   My rating is an overall good one because of the customer service (fab) and atmosphere (not the same ole same ol) but I would like to go back and check out different food options.",

I'm a little confused on whether you actually have a waiter/waitress since everything is basically do it yourself and you take your card to the counter to swipe and pay before leaving. I tried the bolognese on this visit and although it was not as fab as Vivace's version, it was pretty good. The pasta is made on-site but it didn't taste fresh to me....I'm just saying. It was good but I think it was just way too many noodles and not enough sauce and I was only able to eat half and took the other half with me and they have neat tupperware like 'to go' containers that are microwavable.....nice!

    "text": "How very trendy this place is. So basically you walk in and they give you a card to just scan at any station you're ordering from and then you get a pager and wait to be buzzed whenever it's ready. It's a neat if confusing concept.  The problem I have with this place is that it's almost impossible to get the attention of one of the cooks making whatever you want to order. Really my friends and I were the only ones in line standing around for a good 3-4 minutes waiting to order a pizza. Which brings me to another point, the pizza here is nothing special to write home about. I jazzed it up with some of the herbs in the pots which I thought was a great idea(that's what they're there for right?), and a healthy dose of olive oil to liven it up. If I was paying regular prices for the pizza I would have said no sir, especially since you are pretty much doing everything but the cooking yourself! But seeing as they have a $5 special on pizza almost every day, I think it's just fine to pop in for a carb loaded snack before you set off to do something else in uptown.  Cheap, quick, not easy to get rung up. Will come again for cheap pizza to pig out on.",

The food is still quite good.  The European, self-service, cafeteria style is different and fun.  The staff could use a Red Bull or two to step up the energy level, but, maybe Sunday nights are just slow.",

    "text": "Despite other glowing reviews posted about this location, I cannot in good conscience give a good review.  Vapiano is a European concept Italian restaurant with a hybrid operation - somewhere between a sit-down restaurant (but no wait staff), a cafeteria/buffet (lines at various food stations), and a fast foot place (counter service).  Vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology.  Each customer gets a \"credit card\" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving.  Maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups.  And if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc.), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter.  Sort of awkward in my opinion.  Vapiano's concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page.  And while that is all well and good, two True tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment.  Vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average Italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness.  After my food was prepared, I took the tray to a nearby table.  I placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table.  Not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids?  Bugs and food - not a good combination!  So I changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables.  Maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant?  I don't know, but since I already had my food, I chose the \"least buggy\" table and finished my meal as quickly as I could.  Guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic?  The moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem.  The last table I selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material.  The drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows.  Well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals.  While pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn't much of a designer.  A simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way.  Another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!  As I left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was.  I mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this.  Had she heard it before?  Did she not care?  I paid and left.  Insects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success.  This location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes.  I give this Vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but ZERO stars for cleanliness.",

The tables were clean and stocked with plants that bring a refreshing look to patrons. Portions were average but tasted very good. To me, it is more of an upscale cafeteria. I would go back again! I just wish they would expand to the mid-atlantic and northeast regions.",

Not my favorite but also nice if you just want to sit and talk for awhile without feeling obligated to keep spending money.  Our group of three had the shrimp scampi, the roasted garlic pizza and then ricotta and spinach ravioli. All of them were decent but definitely not spectacular. Id probably eat here again if i worked or lived in Uptown but for the few times each month that I'm there, there are other locations I prefer.",

Upon leaving, you present your card where your charges are all stored - and you pay either as a group or per person. Makes check splitting easy. I wasn't pleased with the pace though. I stood and waited for my pasta and salad for a good 10 minutes awkwardly at the 'bar/cooking area.' You order, they make one dish at a time, hand you your plate on the counter, and then the next person orders. Highly inefficient and for such a pretty place, it feels like a cafeteria. The food itself was fresh, but just okay. Not good for a date or business lunch, but good for groups or a casual meal.",

The thing I hate is their \"system\" I'm never standing in the right line. In fact the time I got a salad, I thought I was standing in an order line for pasta, but was in the pasta exit line. I hate having to navigate the tight tables with a tray of food, only to have to add a drink (like I needed more stress) to then have to carry that sliding, spilling mess to TRY to find a table. The funny thing about this is the number of \"hostesses\" standing at the front doing nothing, instead of helping customers figure out lines or seating.  Bottom line, I never crave this food and it's just not worth the hassle.",

They even have a small herb garden growing that you can pick and add to your own dishes.

Pricing is a little bit more then a Just Fresh.  1 restroom all the way in the back getting around a myriad of people at lunch. 1 beverage station in the back so if you are sitting towards the front can feel like a hike.  Can be confusing if it is your 1st time & you don't have a guide as to how it works.  They will give you a card when you 1st enter.  Take the card to the station you'd like to order from. Swipe on the pad in front of the station after you order.  It is now on that card.  Just need to take the card when you go to the cashier & they will swipe it for the total.",

You stand in line order and wait on your food and then find a spot to sit. I like the layout of the spot, but I would rather have a waitstaff person doing the majority of the work (just my preference).   I had a side caesar salad and a salmon pasta dish that wasn't too flavorful. It was more than what I cared to pay for on such a bland meal.",

    "text": "Great place for groups fresh food all homemade pasta lots of variety and a good amount of seating. This place does not have waiters so it is a seat yourself and order based on what you wants type of mentality. You use cards to charge what stations you want to eat from and at the end everything is put together into one bill. The food is good and caters to pretty much everyone's wants and needs I had the surf and turf pasta with a little bit of beef and some shrimp over with a white sauce it was good however I think the traditional pasta dishes are a safe bet and have never treated me wrong. The bar is fully stocked wine is good quality inn does not cost an arm and a leg and they always have heavy pours. This is good for families or four individuals I would recommend this place to most people.",

    "text": "We went to Vapiano's after seeing a show at Blumenthal Performing Arts Center because it was close by and it was open until 11:00pm on a weekday. It was my first time and I was confused with the set up but a couple of the girls with us had been there before. It's a beautiful place. We walked in, got a card from the hostess at the front, found seating, grabbed a menu and then you go to the station of your choice. I went to the pasta station first, they scanned my card and I ordered my pasta with olive oil, chili peppers, garlic and black pepper, hold the cheese. I then went to the salad station where this young lady was cleaning some equipment and didn't seem thrilled that I wanted a salad. I ordered two garden salad all the while getting the, you're bugging me and I want to go back to cleaning so I can get out here look! Oh well! I am a certified servsafe manager which means I took a course on food safety and handling and passed with flying colors. I noticed she didn't wash her hands although she did change her gloves.  Pasta was delicious and I actually ordered more. This time one with a red sauce, extra chilies and again, very good. I never order pasta when I eat out because it so cheap and easy to make at home but I broke tradition and went for it.  My daughter had the shrimp Alfredo pasta, loved it! Her friend had the calzone, huge!! But they put a small tomato in the middle to keep it puffed up so it looks like it's filled with stuff but it's really just a tomato causing the illusion. Ha! Good one.  So everything you order gets scanned on the card and when you are done you go to the checkout with your card and pay. Definitely an honor system kind of set up.  So don't walk out without paying folks! It's stealing! LOL!  This place is definitely worth a visit! Check it out!  That is all!",

Really gave no direction as to what to do , I wasn't impressed.  You decide if you want pizza, pasta or another choice an go stand in that line an you get your drink an serve yourself unless its an adult beverage you go to the bar. They do have a nice ice cold  water station I did like that. I ordered the pizza Hawaiian an bruschetta it was okay. But if your downtown you should try it an they have gummie bears  for when you leave mmmm I did get some they were chewy gummie bears lol",

I got the salon entree which was good however, I asked for medium and it was a little under. The veggies weren't so great. But our waiter Chris was amazing & I will definitely be back.",

Great method of paying and preventing delays. I also had the sangria which was surprisingly strong but at the same time fruity and refreshing. Would definitely recommend.",

It worked out pretty well and I ended up liking it. I thought the sauce was a little too salty but the pasta itself was al dente.   The cool thing about this place is the payment process. So basically you get this card that you lay on the table (while making your order). The order you make gets tied to that card - so that later, you get charged upon returning it. After making your payment, there is also complimentary gummy bears at the front desk. Sweet!",

I went when it was empty late at night and ordered the pasta arrabiatta, which has tomato sauce, chilies, onions and garlic. I got penne noodles and a spice level 4 (out of 5). I love spicy foods and 4 was good for me, could've gone for five. Bf got pollo picante and liked it. I enjoyed mine but didn't love because I make a really awesome pasta arrabiatta at home... the noodles tasted freshly made.   You pick your noodles, selected from prepackaged noodles they say are handmade (seems like it!) I wish they'd say if they were wheat semolina or whatever kind they are, as I'm curious for nutritional purposes. You can observe the chef preparing and cooking the food. Or sit down and head over when they're ready.   I like this for a fast casual, yet more upscale and nicer ambience, Italian meal. The dining space has a nice touch, marble blocks on tables with stools. Some on the walls have back support. Dim lighting.   Before leaving, you take the card u get to scan what u order to the front and pay there. No waiters here.",

When you first enter the restaurant you are given a card and you order food from different stations and at the end you pay off the balance on your card. The stations are pasta, salad, pizza and antipasti. Of course I was pretty confused since its my first time and I didn't know how to order food. But eventually I order the Carbonara Pasta with a side Caesar salad and a small Pana Cotta  The good: The pasta was very fresh, being hand made. Definitely not the store bought dry pasta. The pasta was also perfectly cooked to my taste. The Pana Cotta was the perfect ending to a lovely dinner. I was so stuffed from the pasta. Definitely bang for your bucks here.  The bad: being my first time here at a unique restaurant like this I wish I was given more directions than \"here is a card you order food  over there\". The Carbonara sauce was also a bit salty for my taste.  Overall would come back here again! This place is a go to place if you are craving some fresh pasta!!",

Maybe a little pricey for cafeteria style, but it's upscalish Italian cafeteria and I can't resist the chicken alfredo, the best cream sauce ever. I like to add a little pesto and chilis to the dish. The thai Italy is a good choice if you want to mix it up. Pasta comes with fresh bread (yum) that you can dip in olive oil and balsamic vinegar which are provided at the tables. Don't miss out. The portions are pretty big as well, I have to split with my boyfriend. The best part, in house pasta! It's so fresh! You can see them rolling it out during the day.   I have also tried the pesto pizza which is also pretty good if you aren't feeling the pasta. I love the crunch with the thin crust pizza.   We have also tried the tiramisu which was sadly a disappointment. Olive gardens tiramisu unfortunately tastes better. Vapianos needs to pick up their dessert game.   Finally, who doesn't love gummy bears?! There is super fresh gummy bears at the hostess station where you grab your cards and check.   I'm hoping to try their brunch menu soon, the salmon crepes sound so good!",

I ordered a salad, with only lettuce, tomato, cucumbers and told the person to add chicken to it. The person who took my order for my salad was very nice and polite, I had no problems. They were quick with my salad, however, when my pager buzzed, I looked at the salad they were making and realized it had way more than I asked for. All asked for was lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and add chicken. The salad had all of that + a million other things. They never just give me what I ask for and that is the 3rd or 4th time that has happened. I keep going back because I really like the balsamic dressing. However, yesterday was the last straw. Management should encourage better customer service because it is AWFUL.  While my salad was re-made immediately, when I ordered, I was very specific about what I wanted. It's frustrating for something to be wrong every time I go. Last time I went they ran out of balsamic dressing and gave me a dry salad, customer service was poor. The time before that, my salad was wrong. I have food allergies so I can only eat salads from there but I won't be back. I'm only giving two stars because I enjoy the balsamic dressing that much.",

I like to eat dessert and my entree at the same time, so this setup was awesome for me. I got to have a sweet alongside my meal, which is how I prefer it! It was half priced wine bottles on Sunday night, so we had a bottle to share. My boyfriend got a calzone. I got linguine alfredo with mushrooms and peas. The food is what you would expect, good, but not authentic Italian. Fine by me, it was still yummy.  The service here wasn't great, the bartender and the hostess were the only staff that were friendly. I had never been here so when I approached the pasta station, there were three people behind the counter, I came up and greeted one of the guys with a \"Hello! How are you?\" He looked at me with a confused look on his face and exclaimed \"HUH?!\" It was a really weird interaction, he then sent me to a different guy at the station. Not sure how you're supposed to know what person to \"order\" from when there are several working behind the station? The second guy wasn't very nice either, not sure if it's just because he could barely hear me though. For someone who had never been here and was trying to learn how the system worked, the staff wasn't very helpful in that regard.  We will be returning here because the food was good and because my boyfriend loved eating it in Germany (it's a German franchise!). Also - they had the good balsamic! Next time I do hope the service is better.",

    "text": "I first visited Vapiano's while in Chicago and loved it.  I enjoyed the pasta dish and bread that I had and it was such a large portion that I couldn't even finish it all.  I was upset that I couldn't take the leftovers because I was heading straight to the airport for a flight.  Once back in Charlotte, I looked to see if they had a location here and was so happy when I found that they had one located not too far from me in uptown.  Well a couple of months had passed and I decided that I needed to give the Charlotte location a try.  OK, maybe I shouldn't have went to the one in Chicago and then I wouldn't have one to compare them too.  Overall, the food was very good, seasoned very well and the bread was awesome.  Now the sad part, I had no leftovers.  The portions that you get in Chicago, if you finish it all, you're just greedy or a big eater.  But the portion that you get here in Charlotte is very small and have you wanting for more.  Now, the cost is the same as Chicago but the portions are much smaller. The staff in Chicago was extremely friendly and you felt that they wanted your business.  I didn't get that feel from the Charlotte location.   I mentioned the small portions to the cashier upon leaving, but she could care less.  She only stated that she has heard that before from others that have been to other locations.  You would think that if you've heard this before that you would mention it to your manager.  Guess not.  I enjoyed my lunch, but with all the other eateries with better portions, decent prices and friendly service, I won't be rushing back to Vapiano's.  NOTE:  The Chicago location has workers checking on you to see if your needs have been met, while you're dining.  Superb service!",

I ordered the greek salad and have been dreaming about it ever since. Mmmmmm, it was perfectly dressed and the capers were a nice touch. The bread & oils are a nice addition to round out the meal. Great spot, cant wait to work my way through the menu!",

Like others noted, it is confusing if you have never been here before.  They do not do a good job of explaining how it works.  I figured out how to order my food and scan my card.  But there were no glasses at the soft drink fountain.  Had to ask.  Told to go to the bar to get a glass.  ??  If you want alcohol, it is a separate bill.  The atmosphere is interesting and clean, but loud due to all the hard surfaces.  Now the food.  Only acceptable.  Nothing great.  The Caesar dressing was very bland.  Had to put some balsamic in it to have some taste.  Liked the oil and balsamic at the table for the bread.  A little disappointed there was no toasted garlic bread.  The pasta was a good portion.  I couldn't eat it all.  Average value.  Hate to say it, but I prefer Olive Garden.",

    "text": "I will say this one of my fav places to go when craving pasta and last min. I have a thing for made to order restaurants so this was right up my alley. Technically I ordered the shrimp pesto with fettuccini but substituted the shrimp for smoked salmon. I think next time I will do regular salmon instead of smoked though the taste was a little strong for me and stayed on my breath for a long time(kind of annoying even with gum). The food is very flavorful though and I can never finish it in one sitting. As far as I know every pasta dish comes with complimentary bread, olive oil, and a balsamic vinegar if I'm not mistaken. You do have to account for the fact that there is no server for each table unless maybe if you're at the bar, so to me that kind of took away from the customer service aspect but not a huge deal. The bar area is very nice as well and always serves great drinks; I'm a sucker for their sangrias. I can't wait til it warms up so I can make use of the outside area. This is a place I would recommend if you have any visitors come to town for a visit, the ambiance is perfect",

I like the concept that you use the card to record your orders at each station and don't pay until the end. However, it is dangerous to not know how much you spent until the very end, (especially after a few drinks lol)....but I guess that's no different from a sit down restaurant.

    "text": "I've eaten at Vapiano, oh, roughly twenty or more times since 2011, and I can say that their carbonara with spaghetti or linguine, garlic, onions, extra spicy (serrano pepper) and with extra parmesan is outstanding. This is a bit embarrassing, but let the fact that I've eaten here as often as I have, and have yet to try anything other than this dish, be a testament to their carbonara.  I can't give them a five though because, as other yelpers have noted, the quality of your dish really depends on the quality of the particular chef making your dish. But on the whole, it is generally great. On somewhat rare occasions, the carbonara can be overly oily.   They're worthy of a four based on this one dish alone.  Edited to drop the rating to a three due to service. Placed an order for two carbonara's over the phone at 6pm, was told the food would be ready in 15-20 minutes. When I arrived thirty minutes later, I was told that there were two orders in front of mine (meaning they hadn't even started my order). I suspect they forgot about it, and my arrival reminded them, and they attempted to play it off as they were busy, when in reality they forgot to start my order. This is not the first time they've been massively off on their estimated wait time, but it is the first time I felt like they completely forgot my order until I arrived in the store. Just be honest and offer a complimentary salad or something. Sheesh.",

The cooks were very rude and vulgar with their choice of words, all while my date and I stood for 15 minutes waiting to order and even a greeting ( hello, how are y'all, we will Be With you shortly). We weren't greeted st all just a nod by the cook to come place an order. The food was the worst I ever had and the cooks seemed bothered when I asked for a certain type of side salad. I literally had to scroll the menu to show them what I was talking about and it still was wrong once my food was ready. Also the cook tossed my Salad and side order of chicken on the counter. I must say the manager on duty after I explained my disappointment was very nice and made sure we got at least our money's worth. I can tell he was as disturbed as we were. Over all it was horrible today and I More then likely will not be spending my money with them anymore.",

The pizza was fantastic, although i felt that the pizza maker had an attitude when taking my order (i had several revisions), and when i returned the buzzer she seemed agitated that i didn't know to drop it in the basket. I loved the ambiance and food, the drinks were mediocre (we asked for a Moscow mule...it tasted sweet and was red .,.).   Upon paying for our bill i found the host (guy with locs) to be very unpleasant and rude. His nails were chipped and he did not make eye contact with us or even thank us for coming. He was too busy stapling receipts. Every bit of rapport we tried to build with him was shot down with a condescending remark and/or expression. There were no pleasantries at all especially being that it is the holiday season and the place looked so pretty.   There was also a guy dancing non stop around the restaurant....he seemed to have worked there ...  Great food and ambiance. Service has opportunity.",

What this means is that the food might not be Michelin star-quality, but the portion sizes are generous, service is quick, and there is always seating (helpful for large groups!)  The setup here is an interesting experience for new patrons, as you are handed a \"charge\" card as you walk in. As you walk up to each of the stations to order your food (which is cooked in front of you), your card is swiped and you pay for your meal at the very end of your visit.   Though Vapiano serves pizzas and salads, my go-to has always been the pastas. The portion sizes are HUMONGOUS, and the sauces tend to be extremely heavy and creamy (though theoretically I suppose you could ask for lighter sauce). Nonetheless, certain pastas such as the carbonara are so tasty so I personally feel it is worth the guilty pleasure - just don't forget to tell your cook to add some veggies!",

I ordered the Arrabbiata with Tagliatelle noodles at a level 5 spiciness (the spiciest they had to offer).  First off, the spiciness level of 5 felt more like a 0.  I'm not sure I could taste any spice in it.  Secondly, the noodles clumped together, and therefore I had a few bites of balls of dough instead of individual noodles.  The bites that I had of the actual noodles were good, but the occasional clumps of dough were off-putting.  I also thought the sauce was pretty underwhelming, even not considering the lack of spice.  The ordering process was a bit confusing, but even after I got it down, it took a while for me to order and for me to get my food.  I had to wait by the counter for my food, too - no numbers or calling of names.  The space was nice, and the service was friendly (for a fast-casual restaurant).  The pricing was reasonable, too.  I just don't think they were able to execute the concept well enough, unfortunately, which lead to an underwhelming experience for me.",

I would give Vapiano's 5 stars, last time I was in there, my friend and I ordered from 2 stations next to each other, and the guys who prepared his food gave him really poor service.   I usually go to the same person if he's there (sorry I can't remember his name) and my pasta is perfect every time. I'll tend to agree with others that they're not the most friendly, but since I only have to deal with them to order my food and my food is DELICIOUS, I don't mind as much.   I've never had the non-pasta options, so I'll have to review again when I try them.",

    "text": "After a Segway tour uptown, we needed a place to grab a late lunch. After passing through Dean and Deluca, we saw Vapiano and decided to give it a shot.   We were greeted upon entering by the host with a smile. He explained how the \"card\" system works. You take your Vapiano \"credit card\" to each station and use that every time you order something. On the way out, you pay it all at once. The interior of the restaurant is modern, with light colored wood, plants on each table, and a huge chalkboard with sayings.  I got a chicken pesto panini, and must admit, a was surprised at how delicious it was. Sliced chicken, just the right amount of pesto, and a fantastic bread. It came with a side salad, which was very good as well. Perfectly dressed and yummy huge croutons.  After we were done, an employee approached us, asked if we needed boxes, how our meal was, and if we needed anything else. Thumbs up. While waiting to pay, they have a jar of gummy bears, never seen that before, but what a great idea.   Overall, Vapiano was a huge winner in my books. Friendly staff and delicious, quick food. I'll definitely be back. Kudos Vapiano!",

There is no wait staff, but you can see the cooks at work through the glass counter, bussers clean after you.   Food is wonderful! This is also a great place to grab drink, ad they have a full bar with friendly staff.   Indoor and outdoor seating, with beautiful modern decor.",

    "text": "I don't know why this places gets low ratings, I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Vapiano!  It is formatted just like everyone says- cafeteria style. You walk in to the \"hostess/cashier\" stand and she gives you a hotel key looking card, and you seat yourself. Perhaps around one of the live olive trees, or at a community table with miniature potted herbs. You then take your card with you to any of the stations (antipasti, salad, pasta, pizza, panini)  and tell the guy what you want off the menu. You can customize your meal to your desire, which is cool. With a swipe of your Vapiano card, you're off to your table with a pager to wait for your meal.   They make their pasta and sauces in house, so you can count on the pasta tasting fresh and delicious. They also cook it up right in front of you, made to order.  I got the pasta funghi this time- cream sauce with a mix of various mushrooms, and added chicken and pancetta to it. It was absolutely delcious. Probably some of the best pasta I've eaten in Charlotte, no lie. And the portion is big enough for leftovers (which reheat just as well as they came out the first time). I also decided i would try the Greek salad- also good, I like that they add capers and dill sprigs to the salad. Salads come served with fresh bread, and there are bottles of EVOO and balsamic at your table for dipping.   They have a full bar, featuring daily drink specials- Sunday being 1/2 price bottles of wine, which is just fine by me. You again tell the bartender what you want, swipe your card, and head back to your table with your beverages.   This concept is great- affordable (like under $10 a plate), quick, and delicious. Loved the \"upscale\" ambiance- it fits quite nicely downtown.",

    "text": "I usually do not write reviews about restaurants but my experience at Vapiano in Charlotte tonight was so mediocre that I have to report it.  My only experience at Vapiano was in Chicago for the past 6 years (I would often go and always had a wonderful experience!!!). Having moved to Charlotte I wanted to give this Vapiano a try and was looking forward to my experience there. Bad decision! The cook was very rude. I wanted a Salmon Carbonara and after glancing at his fridge he told me the restaurant was out of salmon (he did not even ask the people next to him if they had any left...) But okay... never mind.  I got a regular carbonara dish.  The cook did not even ask for my preferences when it came to preparing the food.  Usually they ask you if you like it seasonned, spicy, etc. Here nothing! He did not even look at me. And I had to ask him for grated cheese on top of my dish at the end, which your cook usually asks automatically. When I told him it was enough cheese he continued grating the cheese. As a result my food was very dull for lack of seasoning and too cheesy. I have never seen that before at a Vapiano. When I complained to the cashier about the cook she said she knew who I was talking about and that I was the third person tonight to complain about him. This is unacceptable!! I do not know if this man is representative of the kind of services you receive at Vapiano's here but I must say I am highly disappointed and do not feel like setting foot there ever again.",

    "text": "Considering how nicely decorated and *huge* Vapiano is, it has some major potential. I've seen reviews across the board and while I definitely gave Vapiano a fair shot, I was very underwhelmed.   The Good: It really is a beautiful place with a gorgeous bar, low key dining tables with fresh potted herbs and a super convenient location if you live/work Uptown. The host and cooks were friendly and informative overall. I didn't have a problem with the swipe cards, although I kept a close eye on my own!   The Meh: The prices were a tad bit high in my opinion, but I'd be fine with them if the quality matched the price tag. I'm not a huge fan of this concept, in general. If I am going to shell out $30 for pizza and salad, I'd at least like a bit of table service.   The Bad: The food. Sorry. I didn't really enjoy anything that I ordered/tasted - details below. Also, I was a bit peeved when I couldn't get a tiramisu (stationed at the bar) to go. I understand they are made in rocks glasses, but please offer a bit of customer service and check if they can be made in a transportable vessel. I imagine they'd sell a ton more, too.   -Pomodoro e mozzarella pizza: 2/5: Total snoozefest. The pizza was lukewarm, limp, a bit soggy and lacking in flavor. The mozzarella wasn't melted at all and there was zero crisp to the crust. Even the basil looked sad. I had to pile on the crushed red pepper and parmesan to get through it.   -Side house salad: 1/5: Looks like bagged salad mix and the house dressing had a super funky aftertaste to it.  -Side Caesar salad: 3/5: This broke my heart because the dressing, croutons, parm shards, and romaine had major potential. Taste was spot on, if a bit thick. However, my poor lettuce was positively drowning in dressing.   The best part of my meal here? The gummy bears on the way out.",

We were a group of four and hence settled for two pastas and a pizza which we later found to be apt quantity of food. The food was amazingly delicious and the freshness of the veggies could be felt with each bite. The prices are very affordable and it might just surprise you since the restaurant is well located in downtown. A must visit for food lovers.",

I will say that the different cooks that you get will determine how great your pasta is but I mostly have a great experience every visit. At Vapianos, they hand you a card that you can put all your meals, drinks, etc. and then you pay for everything at the very end. An interesting part of this place is that you can get free gummy bears at the register where you check out. Five stars for this restaurant because of the great service that they provide and the great tasting pasta they serve.",

    "text": "A friend and i decided to stop by Vapiano after watching \"The Nutcracker\" ballet. The interior is well designed with modern decor, creating a pretty trendy atmosphere. This is about the only good thing I can say about the place.  The concept seemed interesting. When you walk in, you are greeted by the host that hands you a card (much like a credit card) and a menu. Once you decide what you want, you go to the appropriate station to order. It reminded me of being in elementary all over again, standing in cafeteria lines.  Since the concept is new, I think it would make sense if there were some form of an info-graphic to inform customers on how the restaurant operates. During our visit, two other customers questioned us on how to order. Furthermore, we were not sure if we were suppose to wait for our food or if someone would bring it to us.   Once we got the food (by the way, you go back up to get your food), it was a huge disappoint. It was so BLAND, absolutely flavorless! My friend got the Primavera Specialty Pasta, with added shrimp, and I got the Chicken Pesto Panini. Both dishes were flavorless. The pasta was basically boiled noodles with veggies. No spices. No sauces. No flavor. We had to ask the cook for some sauce (which was basically some form of tomato soup). My chicken was completely dry. We both added balsamic vinegar (A LOT) to our dishes to have.. oh what's it called... flavor! It was probably the worst \"Italian\" \"food\" I have ever had in my life.  The food is very inexpensive for uptown, but it is also of very poor quality for uptown. Sorry, can't say that we will be coming back =/",

    "text": "Nothing quite beats hand-made pasta. That's just a fact of life. And if that isn't enough to convince you of this establishment's legitimacy, then you'll be pleased to know that EVERYthing on the menu is hand-made.   Of course, freshly prepared food at a fast casual restaurant is somewhat of a double-edged sword. Yes, food always tastes better when it's made in front of you and you can customize it any way you want (I'm always adding roasted tomatoes, mushrooms and garlic to all my pastas). However, there are still a few kinks this place needs to figure out before it achieves greatness. If you go at lunch time or the dinner rush, you could be waiting upward of 20 minutes for your order. Tip? Go one hr before or after 12 pm or 6 pm to ensure you get your food in a timely manner.   The system is simple. You receive a nifty little \"credit card\" where every purchase/order you make from any of the line cooks gets electronically added to your line of credit, which is pretty much limitless. At the end of your meal they swipe your card for the total amount and you pay as you exit. Unfortunately that leaves the onous on the customer not to misplace that shizzle. The size 6 font on the back of the card will inform you that it can cost $50 to replace if lost :P  What's particularly superlative about this place though is the FRESHNESS of ingredients. You can see the ripened juicy cherry tomatoes before they're sliced and put into your pomodoro, and the pieces of meat aren't pre-cooked, so they're tender when served. The pizzas are hand-tossed, with fresh basil growing in the back and homemade tomato sauce. Their oven also crisps the edges nicely. They even have other more authentic dishes like beef carpaccio and bruschetta, which are definitely worth ordering.   Interestingly, you don't have to come here just to eat, you can also just chill at the bar, which has great happy hour specials, genuine and kind staff, and a diverse selection of premium liquors. Fresh tiramisu is on display in a glass cabinet :P  I go here everyday and it's great to know a place that can cater to my Italian cravings and carb-heavy diet.   Shout out to Sim and Maurice :)  Don't forget the gummy bears on your way out!  4/5",

When we entered we were given a warm greeting and then instructions on how this restaurant operates.   The hostess/cashier said it was created after a \"German\" model. That was the first thing that struck me odd...if it's created after something German, why are they serving Italian? I'm sure Italian is more popular, but I could see it working with brats and beers just the same.   We walked around with the \"debit\" cards, but found it feeling too cafeteria style for us. Plus, if the chefs/servers are waiting for us to order, there weren't any around when we were checking out desserts to sell us on one. Plus, if it's Italian, the desserts should be overwhelming and beautiful. Instead, they looked like basic pudding you'd find at a Furr's. We also curious about the menu...where was it? I got overwhelmed with the writing above each station, that perhaps that was it and I missed it?   We left feeling like it had potential, but wasn't too customer service oriented. I see how others had the same feeling of a dorm cafeteria or something...that is the impression that has stuck with us. I'll give them stars for the decor, location, and olive tree in the middle, but not sure that we'll go back to try the food though since the prices are high and they make you work for it.",

    "text": "I initially liked the concept at Vapiano - when you walk in the door, you get a nifty credit-like card to record your purchases and a menu to help you decide.  You order at the whichever counter(s) you choose (pizza, pasta, salad), watch your food being prepared in front of you, and pay on your way out.  The problem occurs when you want multiple items, or when you are with a friend. You must wait at separate stations, and the waits are usually long. It took me and a friend 45 minutes one Friday evening to get our food (when they would NOT even be considered busy). I would rather they switched to a concept where you order all of your food at once, then sit down and have them bring it to you (similar to Figo in Atlanta). It's much more customer service friendly, in my opinion.   Being a pasta lover, I usually get the pasta. You choose your pasta and sauce separately. And there are quite a few options, although no angel hair pasta. I tried the pappardelle with funghi (creamy mushroom) sauce on one occasion. I was surprised at the generous portions. What a great value for $7.95! And, most importantly, it was delicious! My favorite so far, though, is the pesto e spinachi - a cream based vegetarian dish with pesto and fresh spinach. It's $8.95, and also a good value.  The food can be somewhat inconsistent and is sometimes bland, however. It really depends on the \"chef\" at your station. On my most recent visit, my pesto needed the basics, like salt and pepper. My friend's pomodoro was so bland that she didn't even get close to finishing it.  But, I have to mention the BREAD. I'm picky about my bread, and theirs is AMAZING -- crispy crust, moist, chewy center. It's included, so don't miss out!  I have been here several times, and have downgraded my initial 4 star rating to a 3 star one for the reasons mentioned above. It's still a good place if you are dining alone, but it wouldn't be my first choice for dining with friends again.",

    "text": "5 stars! Going back! Great place definitely worth checking out! I first went to Vapiano's with my roommate and her mom on her visit here. My first impression was great- a sign outside the place announcing their special of $3.50 OMB drafts.   Upon arrival the hostess greeted us with a big smile, asked if we had been there before and offered an explanation of how to swipe and dine! She gave us each our own cards to use, we grabbed up our own menus and headed to the table of our choice.   Above the food stations there is a huge chalkboard with fun sayings and drawings- nice touch! My roommate loved that each table has its own herbs you can pick off and use to add to your meal. Cases holding the herbs double as decor in this updated interior space.   I've been back several times since that first visit and have not been with anyone who has had a disappointing meal. Vapiano menu ranges in price from $3.95-$9.95! 5 main selections on the menu including: antipasti, insalate, pizza dela casa, pasta, and panini.    3/4 times I have visited, live acoustic guitar with great jams accompanied the already fun, inviting and laid back atmosphere.   Yay Vapiano!",

    "text": "I had actually passed by this place several times without any consideration before going with a group of my gal pals.  A rather large group (there were about 20 of us).  When I walked in the door I was pleasantly surprised.  The place is really contemporary and modern looking.  As a result I thought the prices would be a little on the high side but man I was I wrong.    As you enter you are given a card which keeps track of all that you order.  Instead of having to wait for a server to take your order you simply head over to your station of choice (pizza, pasta or salad) and place your order.  Be amazed as your food is prepared right before your very eyes.  You can order drinks from the bar or the food stations.  Once your food is ready you can take it back to your table and dive in.    I wasn't overwhelmed by the taste of my food but it's definitely some place that I would revisit.  The meal prices ranged from $7-$11 and for the portion size that I received it can't be beat.  This is also a great place for large groups.  Thanks to the order cards you never have to worry about splitting the bill.  Another great thing is that the evening I went there was live music.  A couple of my friends were even asked to join the musician in song and dance.  That made for a pretty entertaining few minutes.  Thankfully they didn't torture the other patrons for too long.  So, if you're looking for a place to eat with a bunch of your friends and you're just looking to relax in an aesthetically cool, chill environment with cheap eats this is the place for you!",

    "text": "This place is super fun. It's like a \"choose-your-own-adventure\" book. The main difference is you're writing the story each time you dine there. You can go there with a big group, a friend you're catching up with, or just by yourself -- it doesn't matter. When you arrive at Vapiano's the hostess/cashier will give you a swipe card. It looks like a credit card or a room key at a hotel.   You use this card to order food, grab a drink at the bar, and pay at the end of your experience. The first time I dined here, my impression of the place from beginning to end was constantly changing. I went from thinking this was a uber hip bar, to a super casual place to meet a friend ... to learning at the end of my experience that Vapiano's is a place where it can be can become a different experience every single time you visit. IT'S REALLY KIND OF COOL!  There's no \"wallet pressure\" if you come with a big group to order a dish within the same price range because you pay for \"ONLY\" what you order.   If you're feeling casual and want an individual margarita pizza with a side salad you can get that. AND, it's made for you right there-and-then on the spot.   If you want a fancy pasta dish they have that as well. The sauces are yummy and the seating is fun. You can sit by the bar and take in the \"hipster\" vibe, or sit outside and soak in the small city skyline, or you can sit inside at a table with fresh herbs as a centerpiece.  It's really just a fun, no pressure atmosphere, with a really great bonus which is --- REALLY GOOD FOOD. You'll actually crave it a few days or weeks later. AND, since you're paying only for what you've ordered, you choose if you break the bank during the meal or not.   I say go to Vapiano's not just for the food, or great drinks at the bar ... but also for the fun experience you'll have each time you go there. I hope you enjoy your experience there as much as I have!   Good luck on your Vapiano's adventure!",

The one in NYC is super chic, always busy, and urban with a downtown vibe.  This one is downtown Charlotte is nice - modern interior & furniture with a patio, large bar and some nice lounge seating.  BUT it's a lot more open than the NYC location - no upstairs location, less tables, and less people - that's for sure.  You don't get the same busy popping vibe as you would in NYC.  But that's Charlotte for you - this location closes at midnight (MIDNIGHT people, the night doesn't even start until then) and the surrounding bars close around 2, so... what can you do.  Also, I ordered the same exact item I ordered from NYC Vapiano at this location - a Bruschetta pizza - but I was severely disappointed with the Charlotte location's.  The chef just handed me a cheese pizza... with 4 pieces of basil on it.  Whaat?  That's not bruschetta.  But I'm keeping an open mind and maybe sometime in the future, I'll drop by again and see if they can do any better.",

It is a classy/casual atmosphere, slightly upscale feel.   Great selection of nice-size personal pizza's and salad's.  I typically get the Insulata Mista and add chicken or steak on it and avocado, drives the price up a few bucks.  Worth it for a grown @ss man, makes for a healthy great meal.  Recently they shorted me big time on the amount of steak, however the cook made up for it.  She knew what she did.   Great place in Uptown for casual food, good variety.",

My sister and I were greeted and given the low down on how the place operates... A meal card gets you what you want from whatever station you go to.   We were mainly there for drinks, service was nice, as were the wine specials. They carried OMB and fat tire, in addition to the usual suspects. My sister got the greek salad, pretty typical but good. We sat outside, which is always nice to have downtown on balmy nights. Nice picnic table style seating, so not tripping over chairs and tables.   The ordering/paying process turned  out to be not as complicated as I thought.   I was also amused to see how casual everyone was considering it was during dinner on Saturday. Like jogging shorts, t-shirt, and flip flops were being sported by both sexes. Definitely not an uptight dining destination.",

    "text": "Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! I don't think I have ever enjoyed pasta this much in my whole life!  The restaurant is spacious with a bar, outside seating, lounge area and food court style dining area. The design and very fresh and new, they have little plants and lamps on each table. My first time there was on a Thursday night around 8:30 and they had a live DJ.   The restaurant has an interesting business model - each person is given a card to keep track of how much you spend and you just swipe your card at each station. Due to this, I thought each plate would be small and you just get multiple dishes and keep track on the card as you go. But it is not the case.   There are many different kinds of pasta on the menu, so I just told the chef I would like a pasta with basil, garlic, tomato, and some chicken. The chef told me that it would be the tomato pasta, which was not the regular spaghetti sauce, but pasta with tomatoes, and he can add whatever ingredient I want, and I can choose one of their many pasta choices.   The chef started cutting the tomatoes, Basil, garlic-- everything was made fresh, and he cooked it right in front of me! I was drooling as I watched him cook.   The food was just amazing! The fresh-cut ingredients with home-made pasta cooked in olive oil, and the taste of basil, garlic and a touch of parmesan cheese on top that just melted your taste buds.   The best part? it was only $7 for such a fine dish! It comes with homemade bread as well! I wasn't that impressed with the bread though.   In the end, I was a happy customer and I would strongly recommend it!",

I had heard that Vapiano was self-serve and had some assumptions that it wouldn't be for me, but the super fantastic daily wine special drew me in (I think $3 glasses until 7pm or something lovely like that).  The space is clean and nicely lit.  It definitely has a nice balance between modern and cozy.  You walk in and the hostess gives you a card, you pick a station (salad, pasta, pizza), tell the friendly people what you want, and it's made for you right there.  You just tap your card on the station and, viola! Good to go!  I've tried the goat cheese pizza and orange and fennel salad...both delicious.  It's a European concept restaurant so no tipping necessary and the prices are very reasonable.  I left a major fan.",

When she graduated.. Tonight we were all back again. It started out out fantastic with the pizza and salad stations and to the men who took care of us. Then I went to the pasta station and things went terribly wrong.. I never like to focus on the bad, as who know what was happening with this man and his life.. He could be having personal issues as he checked his phone a few times as I was waiting.. I have no idea... But this is not what this review is about. It's about the Employees who went Above and Beyond to make me and my family feel Welcomed. 1. The man who came up to me that was cleaning his station. His goal to fix the hiccup that had happened at the pasta station. 2. The Chef who came to our table. He went above and beyond again Listening and making us feel important. 3. The bartender who I have no idea if she knew if she knew what had transpired. However, she was warm and engaging. And 4. To the manager who was supportive and made us feel welcomed. These 4 individuals were Amazing and Exemplify what True Customer Service is about. If you are looking for  individuals who truly care about guest service this is your place!! Thank you all for all you did for me and my family, we truly appreciate it!!!",

Food is served in a high end cafeteria style but tables can be tough to come by since many customers hold tables against the rule of waiting until they have their food.  No policing of tables and bussing is very slow.  Line to pay can be long and slow.  Last time we had to request ice several times since fountain was out.  They also hold numerous tables as reserved causing more congestion.  A nice feature is the live soul music but it does cause difficulty in getting through checkout.    Cooks are generally very pleasant and courteous.   Very hard working.  Good for lunch, avoid at night or during rush periods as the place does not seem well managed.",
