It then took approximately 10 minutes for someone to drop off salsa, and another 5-8 for another server to greet us to get our drinks. After we ordered drinks, it took another 10 minutes to place our order even though our menus were gathered and folded on the table (sure sign to anyone that we were ready to order). I ordered for the girls, 2 quesadilla kids meals, and a taco salad for myself.  My husband  ordered apetizers for us (chicken wings, and guacamolel) and Carne asada as a main course. We specified that the kids food should come first, even before the apetizers.  Well... the kids meals came first, then came my order, then my husbands order...lastly came you guessed it the apetizers. The kids hated their quesadilla said it tasted funny (mozzarella cheese?) Needless to say the other entrees an apetizers followed suite.  It was so ... bland.  I am pregnant and hospital food tastes better than this. Got the check to find out that the kids meal does not include a drink even though I asked the server if I could get orange juice with their meal (he agreed). 2 bucks per drink for some imitation non refillable oj had me at my wits end.  I just told my husband deduct it from his tip. He laughed and said we should have went to chick FIL a.  If you ever get the feeling of going to this restaurant dont.  Take my husbands advice...just go somewhere else.",

We ordered our drinks and food, no issue. After waiting 40 mins,which is crazy for this place, we get 2 of our 4 orders. Wait another 10 minutes we get the third order. She finally ask me my order as she is dropping this entree off. Telling me it was coming she has to go pick it up. Ok. Another 5 minutes passes my family is finished with their plates, she picks their plates up and apologize again. I tell her it's alright, just put it in a box I'll eat it at home we are ready for the check. She returns with the bill still no food and we notice they charged us full price for their mistake. I ask her if some compensation can be made, she replies \"no, is you want the food you have to pay for it\" to that I said \"no worries.\" Great customer service guy! I'll drive a few extra minutes if it means I can actually have the food I order. Will not be back to see you anytime soon.",

It was cheep and tasted very good. We started off the night with a Margarita which was good. Got Guacamole that was tasty as well. You cant go wrong with a 2.50 guac dish. As for as our main dishes it was great!! I think this place is very good.   I have yet to be there for the Lunch or Lunch Buffet, the dinner was great. The plates were huge and tasted wonderful. If you think that \"South of the Border\" is good Mexican then A) you don't know good Food B) this place will blow that crap out of the water!!  In the area you can not beat this place for food and for the price. it is a must go to place here in this part of Charlotte.

Mostly a huge pile of stale lettuce floating atop of sea of greasy and essentially  tasteless soupy gray ground beef.  The tamale was  completely saltless but very peppery shredded meat of indeterminate species sitting atop a generous pile of ever so sticky and tasteless masa.   The taquitos were burned but running with liquid grease.  The salsa was really just canned tomato sauce without the usual seasonings including salt but with a dash of vinegar.  The only thing that could make this meal worse would have been table full of loud foul mouthed aging juvenile delinquents discussing with pride their DUI achievements along with petty crimes and best techniques for lying to law enforcement along with vivid graphic descriptions of the contents of diapers and the method of expressing canine anal glands.  These conversations were provided by several young men wearing blue Horne Heating and Air Conditioning tee shirts and tolerated with no attempt at control by management.  Just aweful.",

I have been here about three times before I started Yelping and each time the food quality seemed to get worse....   First, this is your typical strip mall chain Mexi joint. They come to your table quick with water and chips (that was the only bright spot). The salsa came and it tasted and looked like watered down ketchup with a fleck or two of pepper seeds in it to give it the appearance of salsa - must have came from a large drum of pre-over-processed salsa rejects. My idea of salsa is fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapenos, etc where I can see and know what I am eating. THIS CRAP WAS GROSS!   My food arrived - I think we all have ordered the \"3 enchiladas\" plate from any of our Mexican favorites. Mine was covered, well avalanched with ice burg lettuce, cold runny sour cream and unmelted cheese. I wanted to ask for a small shovel to find my 3 enchiladas covered up on the bottom. Anyway, i got to them and the chicken was ice cold and gross, one bite - done with that one....I thought, hmmm, melted cheese enchilada....wrong - cut into that and all the cheese was still unmelted - WTF! The beef enchilada was ok and it warranted two bites, but had no flavor.   Trying to keep this short - but overall, food SUCKED and I will not go back even on someone else's dime!   see my pics from this trip....",

I went in tonight to buy a bean and cheese burrito and it costed me almost $5 for something that really should of only costed $1.50 at most!

Extremely close, for those eat and sleep situations and 2. The food is good (and the beer is pretty cheap), and lastly 3. The portions on the plates are absolutely huge and plentiful.  I don't understand why they have a low rating on the restaurant, as this is the place I would go to for a quick mexican food fix. I mean I have to say this isn't the place to get a nice gourmet mexican food. It's a place where you go get down and dirty with some mexican food and if you choose to drink, they have a bar and you can lounge.   Overall, I think this place is wonderful. I get my fix for mexican food and well, I come out full. I'll definitely come back to this place when I'm craving for it.",

Our first problem was that the hostess who was going to seat us, didn't seem to know how to seat us properly as she was trying to pull apart tables that she didn't need to pull apart, when there was a table already put together and ready to seat us at. The next problem was that my drink, which was a simple sprite, tasted awful and had no Carbonation at all so I had to switch to a coca cola instead, which after my first refill of coke, the second one had no carbonation either. When we were ordering, the server didn't seem to understand what were we're saying while we were ordering, we finally decided to use google translate to get our order placed. When the order finally got placed and we were given our food, multiple things were wrong with the order, things were missing while other things didn't come until asking several times for the missing items. Eventually after getting everything, we asked for a manager multiple times and finally had to walk up front to get one and talk to them. Must say, this will probably be the first and last time my family and I will be eating here.",

The service wasn't bad, staff is friendly and they are quick to take your order as well as refill water and tea.  When I walked in I was promptly greeted and brought to a table, no menu yet (I'm guessing it's because some people chose the buffet, I did not) While waiting they brought me water because they had no soda for the syrups and they also offered me tea. As I am looking through the menu I notice a fly and then another and then another and then, we'll you get the point.  I didn't think much of it because it was a little warm and there is a buffet, not to say you'd want flies in your food there either but I was finally ready to order.   When I got my food it came correctly and with a fruit fly in the sour cream.  I told my server thigh I wasn't planing on eating the sour cream any way.  I ate the rest of the food, no flies I could see and it was no where near as good as I hoped it would be.  Overall rating out of 5 stars I give them a 3 Food 2 stars Staff 4 stars Cleanliness 1 star  They left a lot to be wanting but there's potential and it was busy so maybe my taste buds just didn't like fly.",

The order came to me without red sauce, but rather buried in the nasty, melted, white velveeta crap.   I ordered a burrito/taco combo for one of my sons and the waitress asked if he wanted hard or soft shell. I said soft. His \"burrito\" was served buried in a red sauce that tasted like spaghetti sauce and came with a hard-shell taco.  My other son ordered 2 chicken and cheese enchiladas. He asked if he could just have cheese and chicken only inside the enchiladas.  Well, these came without any cheese and inside was chicken and huge chunks of green chilis. And of course smotheredin their disgusting version of white \"cheese\" gunk.  Will not be returning ever!!",

Chicken was flavorless and service tried to be friendly but didnt seem like enough people working   Uhhhh no thanks! I'll pass next time...",

So his tacos came out hard and we asked to send them back to get remade and the server couldn't take them back he said he would need to get a manager to come get them since it's a mess up. But I worked in the restaurant business before he could of taken them back to the kitchen.  So as we are waiting for the tacos my husband orders another margarita and he never received it. The server said the kitchen is backed up tonight but it couldn't have been there were 5 tables in there lol.  The food was really good and the drinks but the service was horrible don't know if we will go back ever again maybe for the food but pray we have better service.",

The restaurant also offers a lunch buffet that looked really tempting for 7.99$.",

    "text": "If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Boyfriend and I made the unfortunate decision to pick this place for dinner tonight (spoiler alert, it's awful).   I ordered enchiladas, boyfriend ordered supreme burrito. My enchiladas were hot on the outside, ice cold and watery on the inside (frozen & re-heated, perhaps?). The real kicker is when the boyfriend found a curly hair on top of his burrito; when we pointed it out to the (very rude) waitress, she asked if it was \"under or on top of the melted cheese\".... as if it makes a difference? Is she insinuating that we placed the hair on top ourselves? Super odd and kind of a dumb question. She did, although hesitantly and with an exaggerated eye-roll, replace the burrito with a new order. Never received replacement silverware for his new order, either.  But, hey, if you like loud restaurants where other patrons are openly discussing testicle problems in grotesque detail (YES, testicles...I can't make this up), bratty kids running around, and incompetent wait staff, this might be just for you!",

My husbands food came out first and he was half way done with his meal when my meal finally came out. I ordered shrimp quesadillas and the veggies were raw which was disgusting. To top it off there were flys in the restaurant and one landed on my plate and got stuck in the cheese. I WAS DONE at that point and I won't be going back here again. NASTY NASTY NASTY!",

The restaurant was very clean, and no screaming children lol...that's one of my pet peeves about eating out, although I know that isn't the restaurant's fault. We will definitely be back!
