Every time I try to give them the benefit of the doubt and give them another try but they let me down every time. The frys and never good they are always undercooked and usually barely seasoned if seasoned at all. I am done with second  chances for this location and will not be returning. I recommend for all those craving some bojangles to take the time and little bit of extra distance and drive to the one down 521 right across the border. Maybe a little far but at least you will have good food.",

I pull upto the speaker and wait about 2 more minutes.  before I said hello and got a \"please hold on for a moment \" wait for another 3 or 4 minutes. Finally get to give my order, one 4 pc chicken supremes comb and mac and cheese instead of fries. Then pull up to the window. And waited another 20 or so minutes. While I watched the manager and other employees walk about the store. Some were even trying to avoid eye contact. I only saw one customer inside. Finally the manager brings a box with him to the window. Opens it and ask what my drink was so i remind him it was a sweet tea he goes and gets it and comes back. We finished the transaction. And I went home. I know I should have checked before leaving but to wait one more second, was not a option. No straw, fork for the mac, or dipping sauce.  Even though I asked for one, not even napkins. Food was still good and satisfying. Luckily I took it to my home so i had utilizes and condiments.",

My family and I 'dined in' and we might as well have ordered to go. There was no food ready (there were customers in front of us and behind) when we arrived to the counter to order. You would think there were no customers waiting. The staff was AWFUL. They did not make any effort to speed up the process to make more chicken, biscuits, fries, etc. Everyone was just standing around. None of the staff looked any one (including myself) in the eyes once from what I could see. This was my third time going to this Bojangles (I am from out of town) and all three experiences were a complete waste of time. I told myself after this go-around, I REFUSE to go back there.",

The folks acted like they didn't want to be there and appeared bothered when we asked them for extras such as ketchup and hot sauce.  The guy in front of us left mad because they couldn't seem to get his order right.  As my son said their \"legendary sweet tea\" wasn't very legendary.  It tasted old and not very sweet.  The fries were greasy and not hot (pet peeve of mine with french fries).  To top it off the place looked and smelled dirty.  Pretty unacceptable considering that it was dead in there.

Right?\" He says \"Yea!\"  This was the first sign I knew something wasn't right. I watch as he makes the rest of my boxes and then proceeds to hand them to me through the window. I asked the cashier, \"These are all large right?\" And he replies, \"Yes, of course.\" I take them and drive away because I have to get back to work. I arrive and work and open the boxes and to my amazement, sarcasm obviously, they are all medium. And with random sauces thrown in, not the ones I asked for. I called them back and told them about their mistake and that I would be coming back to get either a refund or the food that I ordered when I got off work. The only thing the manager had to say was, \"Oh wow! That sucks!\" I agreed and later that night I showed up to get my proper order and a whole new manager said no one wrote down any notes and that he couldn't do anything about it. Highly disappointed and will never be going back.",

The only saving grace was the manager (who I believe was latino).

Next we were told to pull up, worst thing you can agree too. There was already a car waiting. We were told to pull around then, which blocked their drive-in line. After 20 minutes we finally got our food. Of course, it was not what we wanted, the club. Go to another bojangles. This one is poorly run.",

First traffic makes getting in and out hard and when you do get inside you see a store that doesn't look like it's had a major cleaning or remodel in years.  I'm the only customer there is I go to the register and service was pretty apathetic with a hint of ghetto attitude for making them work.  I get my order and see that all the tables are dirty and the floor hasn't been cleaned so it's a game of find the least nasty. Sit down and the sandwich is overcooked to the point of being rubber.  The fries were pretty average so I ate quickly and left, no point in trying to get that mess fixed.",

I'm in a bit of a rush and I'm picking this up for a friend (hangover cure all) so I try to find someone to help. She says it will be a minute. She then takes a drive up order (!) although there are two of us now at the counter.   I finally placed my order and the woman who helped me and the other woman who gave me my order were very nice.

Alas, I had made my way to the area for a different restaurant that had turned out to be shut down. Therefore, my craving for a chicken and rice bowl had to be satiated.  Now when I got here, my first sign of what I was in for should've been the condition of the parking lot and the lack of customers dead in the middle of lunch time. Had to have my bowl. Then it should've been the sanitation score of 90. Not horrible. Gotta have my bowl. Then maybe the 5 minute wait at the cash register without another soul in line in front of me. Bojangles...it's bo-wltime.  Finally my order was taken and $5 and change later I had my bowl. It was totally worth it, by the way. But it was about the only thing worth it in here. The tables were messy. I guess all the orders were coming through the drive thru because it was empty inside but they stayed busy in the back. After I had ordered I waited entirely too long to call this fast food. At least one person that came in after me got their food before me. I would literally never come back to this location.",

I stopped and went inside to order 20 assorted biscuits. Immediately I heard the other workers making it known that they weren't happy about my order. It's 6:30am so I also ordered a coffee because it's no big rush on my end. The cashier took my payment and then told me they don't take large orders like this from the counter and from now on I needed to call in advance. I told her I didn't mind the wait and I was given an eye roll and \"hhhhmph! I greatly appreciate the biscuits but from now on I'll call ahead of time. To tell let them I'll go get bagels and donuts.",

    "text": "The worst fast food experience I've ever encountered with Bojangles. And I'm a big fan of their food; however, I wouldn't recommend this location to a starving individual.   I pulled up to the intercom and waited for someone to say, \"Welcome to Bojanles may I take your order please\" but instead only received dead air. I pulled up to the window to see 3 individuals standing there with it open talking to each other. I still was not acknowledged. Finally the young lady at the register proceeded to take my order and asked a young man to prepare it and he said that he wasn't going to do it and laughed and walked away. She continued to ask him and then a young lady at the front counter began putting my order together only to \"dump\" the chicken out of the box. The young lady who took my order asked me to pull up so that the young man could prepare my order and bring it out to me. I was unsure of where to pull up to so I pulled around to the only entrance and exit of the restaurant and waited. I'm assuming that I was at the wrong location that they asked me to pull up to because all 3 of the individuals and the assistant manager, who I later found out was named  Christian stood up front and stared at me. When the young lady at the front counter bought my food out the order was incorrect. I parked my car in a parking space to go inside to explain that they gave me the wrong order only to stand there at the register for 3-5 minutes (which is a long time for the store to be empty) when the front counter lady stared at me, again without saying a word began to put chicken in the box. She was attempting to put 3 pieces of chicken in a small box and became frustrated as she was smashing the chicken down in the box. She yelled out to noone in particular that she needed a bigger box. After she changed boxes she handed me the chicken and I explained that was not my order. She finally found my order and prepared it as I asked for the manager. Christian, the assistant manager walked up front, incredibly unprofessional as I asked was the location a franchise and then I asked for the owners name, in which he did not know! I then asked for the manager's name in which I was given and told that she would not be in until the morning shift. He asked was there a problem and I said yes. He didn't even ask was there something that he could do or inquire about the problem as if this was an every day occurrence. I left and called the number on the door, explained to the representative and she reassured me that someone would be in contact with me. Three (3) weeks later I receive a $10.00 gift card from Bojanles and a card saying thank you!?!? My question is for what?!?",

I call back to hear a busy signal for the next half hour once I return home.  I'm owed the dinner I paid for.  I will update my response if or when anyone cares enough about this to respond since I can't get a hold of anyone otherwise.  I will upload a photo of the receipt alongside our order we received if I can find the upload button. The time and date and what we received is evident in the picture.  UPDATE:  After returning to the store and explaining everything, after a little lip / attitude from the guy at the window, they remade the tenders, biscuits and two mashed potatoes but not my whole order.  Nice of them to at least replace what they did wrong but its kind of foolish for them to act indignant when this is clearly a mistake of the staff.  I won't be back but raised my review to 3 stars for them \"making it right.\"",

It took forever, there wasn't anybody else in line, wasn't busy at all, the same car was at the drive through window when I pulled into the parking lot was there when I left the restaurant. They wasn't waiting on chicken, it was piled high on the bar. The worker who packed up our order never called out our order she just gave us a \"stank face\" look. We got the our food and left, they didn't put the right food in our bag, the chicken was way under cooked and nasty!! What a total waste... very poor management here.
