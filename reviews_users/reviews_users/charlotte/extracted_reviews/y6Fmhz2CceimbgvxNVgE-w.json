A great surprise on my first bite (and last one too)!  REALLY GOOD!!  It was hot, it was fresh, and it was tasty!!  They had a special drink too that I tried, also refreshingly good!  Graciela was our waitress and she had a very witty personality.  Totally enjoyed the evening and will even go out of my way to come back here!   (If I had to say one thing they could improve upon, it would be the salsa needs some work).  Still 5 stars.",

There are premade items like mini chimichangas, taquitos, quesadilla, enchiladas etc, then there are entrees like creamed chicken, pork, shrimp etc. And then the taco bar!!!!!!! With beef, cheese, sour cream, fresh guacamole, pico de gallo and other toppings. They also have fresh fruit and a couple of sweet items like rice pudding and fried plantains. What's not to like? It's so great! This is my new favorite lunch place! It's not gourmet, just really good mexican lunch food and I am in love!  Update: ok it's not as good as I remembered the first time. The food is low quality. After eating here a few times I have had my fill and get sick at the thought of going back.",

I was surprised by the fact that it wasn't that busy inside given that it was a Saturday night but I actually enjoyed it that way. The restaurant was very clean which was also nice. This was just the kind of mexican food we were looking for, nothing fancy about it just your basic kind that you would expect to find at a place like this. Their salsa was good, not too chunky and their cheese sauce was also delicious. My husband and I both ordered two bean burritos with cheese sauce and a side of rice and we were both pleased. The bean burritos are a good size too so one might be enough for most people, we were really hungry!  We will def. be going back here when we get cravings!",

When a co-worker mentioned going over to their newly opened establishment, I figured, ok, why not. Give em another go. Well, I was pretty impressed.   I don't remeber them ever having a lunch buffet before, maybe they did, just not sure. But in any case, it was pretty awesome if I must say so myself. More than just not bad for $7.50. Although I didn't take notice, I'm sure they have the same menu items as before.  The new layout is definitely worth noting. Great atmosphere, and a nice bar set-up which I think I'll be back to hang out around. Gotta figure out the drink specials next.  Great staff also!",

    "text": "We found this place last year when we visited Charlotte for the dirt races and was looking forward to a return trip this year. We opted for the lunch time buffet, and were once again delighted with the offerings provided. I'm not usually a fan of buffets as I find things tend to sit around too long, but that simply isn't the case here as most items are put out in small quantities and replenished often. We opted for the margaritas with an upgrade to 1800 tequilia and were not let down as they were fabulous.  The staff members are absolutely some of the friendliest people you could ask for as there seems to be a family that works there that remembered my friend and I from last year....\"You're from Pheeely, no ?\"  Not sure that we are coming back next year, but if we return to Charlotte, we will definitely make a return trip to Los Arcos.",

The food here is absolutely fantastic! As always I order ACP. Now the interesting thing about their recipe is that they put Monterey Jack Cheese on top of the rice and chicken and baked the cheese rather than pour cheese dip on top. Very interesting ! I have to admit it was very good ! I also ordered queso dip with beef (no charge!). My waitress was very friendly and had a nice chat with her. I was totally full after my meal (NO MAS!). Prices were fair . Overall just a great place , friendly staff, excellent but interesting food , what more can you want? I was a little confused why this place wasn't packed because it was 5pm and there wasn't much people there. Hopefully they get business because I will certainly be back when I'm in Charlotte !'",

I decided to do that on a random Thursday afternoon.  There weren't many people when I got there, but it quickly got busy within 10 minutes.  The food wasn't too bad for what it was.  Lots of different things to try, which is great.  One thing that would have been nice is if they had signs of what some of the items were.  I'm not sure if they switch things out throughout the day, but it would be nice to know if my enchilada had chicken or beef before grabbing it.  Overall it was decent.  I wouldn't mind coming back again during another random day throughout the week, or even try their Sunday buffet.",

    "text": "Charlotte University Location.    Reading the other reviews here on Los Arcos, I'm going to believe that we visited this location on a bad evening. This was the first visit to this location of Los Arcos, and we were not as impressed as with some other local locations of the namesake restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, actually much nicer than any other local Los Arcos location visited previously. Service was acceptable, nothing spectacular but adequate.  We both ordered the same entree, the Arroz Camerones. On the entrees arrival, we found the temperature of it to be lukewarm. It obviously had set several minutes before being picked up to be brought to our table.   I assume their shrimp used in this dish was that of Gulf shrimp. Both orders large shrimp had a very strong iodine taste to it, as typically found in the Gulf of Mexico Brown shrimp variety.   Unfortunately, there was a inordinate, overwhelming large amount of onions mixed in with the remaining ingredients. My companion asked the waitress if this was a normal amount of onions and about the coolness of the plate. The waitress graciously offered to take it back and have the plate remade, which we accepted.  I'm believing that we just visited on an off night and perhaps this location will be better on our next visit.",

All together it's an ok place I will come back and try it again since it's a new place and maybe they will get things fixed.

I ordered the carnitas. We were really excited to see all of their draft beers were $1. When the food arrived, we only had one set of silverware and didn't notice until she left. My carnitas were awful. I could hardly cut them. I ate a small piece and had to tell the waitress that I couldn't eat it. They were over cooked and extremely fatty. Hugh disappointment. I reordered the taco combo which ended up being okay. About half way through my brothers meal, he realized it was wrong. There was no taco, but an unknown item instead. That aside, the three items were weak and small in size.   If I go back, I think the buffet is the way to go. Other reviews say it's only $8!! The family next to us got the buffet and it looked amazing. Between the dollar beers and the buffet, this could be a solid place for a Saturday lunch, but today was not a good experience.",

Then it mysteriously and suddenly closed. Everyone was bummed.  Magically during my last year of undergrad, a new restaurant was being built near the boardwalk...and guess what it was? LOS ARCOS.  The anticipation was real. I drove by about once a month to see when the heck they were going to open!  Finally, I came in for my first meal. The chips and salsa were on par and the drink specials weren't bad either....it didn't feel like the old Los Arcos though.  If fact, in the years Los Arcos vanished from the scene, the other places triumphed over their absence. No longer were they the go-to Mexican place for UNCC students.  I then developed a love-hate relationship with the restaurant. Sometimes it would be good, but many times, I would feel like eating at another place instead.  I don't avoid Los Arcos, but it is definitely not my first choice for Mexican food in the area either.  Tori and I did get sick from eating here last year. It seemed to be mild, nothing that kept us home from work or school, but it wasn't pleasant!  It was probably an isolated experience though.",

The menu itself is very affordable with many different, classic options.  I went with Carnitas and the man went with enchiladas. As far as taste, they were both spot on. My plate was so huge, there was no way I could eat it all. I was able to share my food and still have plenty to take home.   Sadly,we ordered the queso fundo dip with chorizo for an appetizer and it was so disgusting. I have had this previously in other places but I was appalled at the taste. We did not finish it.

As she walked into the kitchen, I remembered and waited for her to come back out before asking for no peppers. When I made the request, she didn't bother to respond or say anything, she simply rolled her eyes and walked off. I asked my husband if I was imagining things and he noticed as well that her body language was rather dismissive from that point on. The food had great flavor but the drinks were way too sweet.

Even with the sauce my wife's enchiladas where very crunchy and not in a good way. They tasted like they were made three days ago and it was just cheese enchiladas. My burrito was even worse. The burrito itself tastes like it had sat at the pass for 15 minutes and then when I tried the beans I found a pebble in them. I wish I was making that part up. Took a spoonful of beans and then bit down on a pebble. Brought it to the attention to our waiter and all he could say was sorry and I will take 20% off the burrito. Since I hate to be the kind of person to demand free meals we just paid so we could leave. He even asked if we wanted the meal to go. Their version of customer service is very lacking. Never saw the manager. Would only go back if it was the last Mexican restaurant left open.",

    "text": "Let's start by saying the food was not stellar.  They had a $7.99 lunch buffet with a decent selection.  I would say that the overall quality of the food is about what you would expect from somewhere that offers a $7.99 lunch buffet.  They had taco fixings, a few different fajita options, dips, chicken wings, fried shrimp... and some fried taquito things that resembled the frozen options from Trader Joe's.    I ordered off the vegetarian menu (the buffet wasn't labeled very well-- no mystery meats for me!), and the cheese enchilada was meh.  The bean tostada was actually surprisingly good.  Their guacamole was not freshly made, and it appeared that someone may have simply mixed pico in with a mix.   As far as drinks are concerned--I started out with a margarita, which tasted nothing like tequila.  It was very sweet, and I'm guessing it was about 99% mixer.  I opted for a draft Miller lite after this.  I like Miller lite, it's a good day drinking option... and what was served in that glass tasted nothing like Miller lite.  It had the distinct taste of a Yuengling, but not the correct color.  It smelled a bit like a Michelin Ultra... but had a small hint of a pilsner smell.  This leads me to believe that Los Arcos does not do a good job cleaning out their lines.  Needless to say I could not finish my 16oz beer.    I give this 3 stars, because the actual amount of food you're able to consume with the lunch buffet makes it a good value... but if you're looking for some quality Mexican cuisine I suggest looking elsewhere.",

    "text": "Two words:  Lunch Buffet!!!  I usually associate buffets with chinese/asian cuisine, but Los Arcos does it up big with their own lunch buffet.    Sadly, I did not partake in the buffet... I ordered off the regular menu which didn't seem overly priced or too big.  Had a Chicken Taco Salad and it was just the right size for my lunch that day.  Have to say, I was a little jealous of the buffet eaters since they seemed to be enjoying each and ever trip back to the buffet.  I believe this site used to be where Max & Erma's was... but they did a complete gut job.  The space is divided with lots of turns and individual booths so no really big open spaces (unless you count the outdoor patio).   The inside still has the \"new paint/construction\" smell and everything has been kept clean and tidy despite the number of people that come in and out on a daily basis.  I'm assuming the buffet is only offered for lunch, but it seems to be quite the popular spot.  One of these days, when I stop running and training for races, I will be a frequent buffet guest here.",

I'm not sure if they built this building specifically for Los Arcos or if it was an existing structure, but if it was already there, they did  a great job renovating. They have a chevron pattern floor - anyone else obsessed with the current chevron craze???   We got the cheese dip to start, which was big for $4.50! I got a combination plate of 2 tacos and rice and beans. Everything has that signature Mexican restaurant flavor. My roommate ended up getting deep fried butterfly shrimp (weird for a Mexican restaurant but that's what she wanted when she saw it on the menu). I think they were frozen out of a box. She enjoyed them though. Overall the food was what we were expecting. Nothing bad but nothing special. It is a great place to hit up when that Mexican craving hits.   While there, I saw that they have a buffet Monday through Saturday for lunch. I will definitely be going back to check it out! I also will have to check out their margaritas and update my review!",

Upon pick up, I realized I didn't receive just a cup of queso; I was charged/given queso & chips. It wasn't a big deal, but to others it may have been. I guess I needed the extra carbs LOL.  It was a Sunday evening (like 30 min before the Series Finale of Game of Thrones), so it wasn't busy. Parking here looks pretty decent.   The super chicken quesadilla isn't anything to brag about.

When we entered, we quickly learned that the buffet is only offered during lunch hours. Having Mexican food on the mind, we decided to stay and left feeling full and happy.   The atmosphere is authentic-ish and the booths were spacious and enclosed enough to offer a private feeling. Our server was adorable and was very attentive to our needs.  The queso was good, nothing spectacular, but I would get it again. The restaurant wasn't busy and the food came out within a few minutes. My date got the chicken and rice. He ate most of his food and said it was very good. It tasted like stir fry with cheese and a mexican kick! I got the shrimp quesadillas. My food was filling but again, nothing spectacular.   Overall, if you are expecting some fancy mexican restaurant, go somewhere else. There is nothing fancy about this place, but there is a homey feel and the food was filling and tasty for the prices.   I would recommend coming for lunch to get the buffet, which I will be coming back to try!   Pro tip- get the 30oz margarita instead of the small pitcher. $2 less and only 2oz less-more bang for your buck!",

    "text": "Found this en route to our hotel while visiting Charlotte. I was in dire need of some Mexican food and glad this popped up on my radar!   We had to order to go since it was a bit late but totally worth the stop. I ordered the burrito and it was everything it said it was on the menu! It was a big ol burrito with Queso and all the fixins!  My husband got the tacos and he scarfed them down like he hadn't eaten in days! The price is reasonable, although they did forget or guacamole we ordered, we ate the beans with our chips so it worked out well!",

I ordered two enchiladas with a taco and rice and my husband got a burrito, enchilada and a tostada. We asked for a hotter salsa and she gave us a squeeze bottle of it which was a huge plus. Both salsas were good but we liked them mixed together.   One thing that I was really impressed was how insanely clean the restaurant was. They had a sanitation rating of 99. The bathroom was spotless and I can see workers cleaning the towels and the buffet.   We want to come here again next time we are in the area and try the buffet!",

Only positive was that the price wasn't high.  Someone could probably pay me to eat here occasionally, but don't expect that's going to happen.",

    "text": "I should have known that when we pulled into the parking lot at 6 on a Saturday and it was almost empty. We should have turned right back around and found someplace else. But we were in a bit of a bind for time and the kids wanted Mexican food so against my better judgement, we trudged ahead. Big mistake. The first thing I noticed was the trash. Napkins and straw wrappers were all over the floor. It was as is no one had swept since the lunch crowd. We asked for a table for four. We were brought to a table that still had the cleaning rag on it. The server assured us it was clean. When an employee leads with that, buyer beware.  The best thing I can say about Los Arcos was the fact that they had Dos Equis amber on draft. However, the bill negated that plus as it was way overpriced.  You know how some places you can really tell that they're really trying? Some might say that they put love into what they make? Not this place. If I had to give this food an emotion, it would be indifference.  As you can see from my picture, my enchiladas supremas was just a big mess. I couldn't tell where one enchilada began and another one ended. It was presented more like a dogs dinner rather than a restaurant quality entree. This theme was carried throughout all of the other meals the family ordered.  I read that they do a good job with the lunch buffet. Maybe that's where they make their money and everything else falls by the wayside. Either way, our experience was awful. Regardless, we will not be back.",

I called to get more information and the lady that answered the phone told me that they had an All-You-Can-Eat Lunch Buffet 7 days a week from 11-3. So I decided to stop by and check them out. I must say that I am impressed. To be able to get authentic Mexican food for a great price ($7.99 Monday -Saturday and $9.99 on Sunday) and as a buffet is right up my alley.   The staff was very friendly from the time that I walked into the restaurant until the time I left (an hour and 15 minutes later). The serving staff did a great job. My cup was always full and one particular server kept coming back to make sure that I was good.   The restaurant appeared to be clean and easy to navigate.   Those of you that know me know that there are very few restaurants that I put my stamp of approval on and recommended to others...but this is definitely one of them.  Keep up the good work guys!!!",

Needless to say we did not stay to order. They did seat us promptly (the parking lot was nearly empty and there was only 2 other tables with guests) and brought us the traditional chips/salsa.  The chips and salsa had me convinced that the food would not be good. The salsa tasted like tomato soup right out of the can. No flavor! No onions, cilantro, green peppers in the dish! I put 2 and 2 together (empty place and nasty salsa) and quickly decided lets go to our regular go-to spot Don Pedro. If you cant make authentic salsa that is an indicator that the food would not be authentic either.",

The staff did a great job replenishing everything and nothing on the buffet seemed \"old.\" It was all very tasty and I would recommend the 7.99 lunch buffet to anyone.
