    "text": "The naan bread and roti are great. But the entrees and appetizers are fabulous. I've so far tried the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala (of course), methi paneer, gobi matar paneer keema (my absolute favorite), paneer phaldari (I like paneer, alright?), panch puran daal tadka and more.   Two standouts for me were the gobi matar paneer and the cholay samosa chaat. And the methi paneer. It's impossible for me to decide on only one because nothing is even close to bad here! Even the rice is fantastic.  The chef always comes out to talk to us. You can tell he really loves cooking and is passionate about sharing his experiences with indian cuisine as well as wanting to hear your thoughts and experiences with indian food. I really like him and the woman who works the front a lot. They are friendly and helpful without being intrusive.   It's our new favorite place to eat!  FYI- Closed Mondays",

The decor is pretty hip and a lot more welcoming than before. The waitress was friendly and had recommendations for us, and the food...THE FOOOOD. I could eat it all day, every day. The portions are pretty big, especially the naan. But it's perfect for leftovers the next day. Considering that, the prices are fair. Highly recommended if you've enjoyed Soma Grill in the past.   Also recommend the mango lassi; it's tasty stuff.",

All the different naans were on point, I'd try the apricot one if you want something different.  We had a spicy chicken app that was excellent and some type of bean salad that was very good as well.    We ate everything as far as main course went.  Goat, lamb, chicken.  The goat was so good(think it was called dhinya gost).  Every sample I tasted was at the level I had expected.  The owner/chef came out and spoke with my family for a good amount of time and told us about him, his background, and what he likes to cook.  Excellent service and even better having the owner come and talk with us.    If the menu looks too small for you, just ask them to make a dish.  They will more than likely accommodate you depending on the dish you want.",

Boy im happy I did...  My favorite Indian place so far! I cant complain!  The level of spiceyness is different from where Im from, being not so spicey so I had to add more spices, but the taste was amazing..  If you love asian, Indian and spicey food, stop by here!  And please try the Garlic Naan.. For $3.0p and 6 slices of bread its so worth it! It has 3 different sauces that come with it that are incredible... I loved all of them...",

For the main course we had dhania lamb and chicken tikka, couldn't even decide which one was better. Just the perfect amount of spice and the perfect amount of heat. It was so refreshing to have Indian food with such a good balance of spices and heat. Also a special shout out to the methi paratha.  The owner was so kind and charming ....he checked on us multiple times....and shared stories about himself and the restaurant. Made the experience even better.  Highly recommended!",

We had samosa chaat, gobi Matar paneer keema and jeera baigan curry and they were all delicious.  The staff was super friendly. I witnessed a waitress send her daughter to the drugstore next door to get a pencil sharpener for the little girl coloring at the table next to us. So thoughtful! The owner, Pim, stopped to talk with us. We got a great history and geography lesson of Nepal, Mongolia and India. It was a great dinner, and we will definitely be back!",

I didn't time it but it was longer than expected. However, the server was very patient with my \"no dairy\" questions!  2. Food was just \"meh\".  We got the Chana Poori, Lamb Curry and Chicken Kali Mirch. And just like others said, it was an odd combination of full of spices yet extremely bland. I don't know how that is possible but it was. It lacked the depth of flavor a lot of other Indian restaurants have.  \"Everyone's a critic\", I know, but we will not be back. Blue Taj, Persis, and Chaupatti easily outrank Tamarind when we get that Indian food craving!  3. Great ambiance and nice servers. Think hipster meets India. It was super cool and felt like we were in the middle of a bustling metropolitan center and not in a strip mall in Matthews.",

We waited close to 30 mins to get a table (even though there were couple of tables free), 15 mins for someone to get our order, about 15 mins more to get the starter. 10 more for main course. We went to this place for my wife's birthday and came out on our wedding anniversary.  You get rice for all the side dishes you order, it's just that it will come 10 mins further late",

Actually, we ended up getting four. Only suggestion is the pricing. $3 per bread is a little on the expensive side, especially since it doesn't come with any meal option. But can't complain too much because it was very flavorful. My girlfriend had never had Indian food before, so we ordered four entrees to sample..the shrimp curry was dynamic. So was the chicken tikki masala. The good thing about this place too is that you can pick your spice level from mild to super hot. They weren't too busy the day we went.but it is a nice place to come and relax. The wait staff is pretty good too.. A great place to try if you never had Indian food before. Will def make you a fan. I went to saffron in Greenville two weeks after eating here and was throughly disappointed.. Saffron lacked seriously in the flavor and seasoning department in comparison to this place,",

Based on my dining experience there (with a party of 6 and over 4 different dishes and appetizers), this place doesn't even deserve one star. With OLD and WATERY recipes, this was the worst Indian food I've ever had.",

Would suggest you bring friends or family so you can sample as many of these delicious dishes as you can.   Be sure to order the \"exploaded\" catfish with mango. We ordered seconds of this dish.     Both curries were so good -we had a red and a green.   And for fun, we sampled two sausage entrees. The Naom Kao was prepared with crispy rice and was a perfect bite. My husband loved the Lao Sausage.  The chef's take on Pad See Ew was the best I've tasted in Charlotte.   The restaurant has changed so you now order at the counter. While excited about our new preferred takeout restaurant, we look forward to spending time with the chef/owner in this local gem. I love \"family dinners\" and this restaurant feels like home.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I LOVE Indian food, and since we live in the area, we wanted to try this place. We initially went at night after work, but we stood there waiting to be seated for a while and were told we'd have to wait a bit for some tables to be cleared off, so we left.  When we tried again, we were the first people in there. I was admiring the decor, but there was dust all over the lighting fixtures. I think it only stuck out to me because I hate dust. The chairs look nice but are uncomfortable. The overall decor of the place gets an A. Super trendy and cute.   The waitress was nice, but it was weird that there was only one waitress/hostess for the restaurant during lunch time. So, if anyone else was ordering, we had to wait a while if we had a question.  The salad was okay. I'm not a huge fan of iceberg lettuce. I ordered my favorite-- Chicken Tikka Masala. It was nice and flavorful, but the gravy was a little thicker than I'm used to. The rice was perfect. The naan was really thin, so hard to pick up the chicken with.  The menu was very simple and easy to understand. I liked that they put them on clipboards instead of handing us a floppy piece of paper.  -- I have to edit my review because the last few times I have been here have been like.. WTF? I don't know how else to describe it, honestly. I waited a long time to edit my review (a whole month) because I wanted to make sure I wasn't over-reacting.   The last few times my boyfriend and I have visited, my chicken tikka masala has been a bright orange color, and super milky looking. I have never seen it this color ever (and I eat chicken tikka masala several times a month)-- and I was told by the chef that he always makes it this way, which is not True because looking at the other photos I've posted and/or taken over the last 5 months, I could clearly see a color difference, and with that difference, I also noticed a taste difference. I am NOT a fan of how it's being made now. I thought I was feeling some sort of way about it, and even my boyfriend said it tasted weird.... To the point that he actually stopped ordering this dish altogether. The naan is still so thin you can't even pick your food up with it. We use the naan to eat instead of utensils, so obviously super thin naan doesn't work.   We usually order to go, and the last time we ordered, I literally had 5 pieces of chicken in my entire order of chicken tikka masala. I literally thought I was going to lose it, especially since I usually give a couple pieces to my 4 year old, which left me with 3 mediocre pieces of chicken. Then, once the chicken was out of the container, more than half of the container was still filled, but with just gravy.   I'm actually so irritated that I can't finish my review.",

Aside of great flavors, it was a lot of food for only 10$ (lunch price).  The levels of spicy they have is 1-4, I went for a 3, hoping for a medium, definitely getting 2 next time.",

    "text": "Akin to my hometown favorite Spice Fine Indian Cuisine back in San Antonio, the owner here, Bhim, has crafted quite the contemporary, upscale-feel Indian eatery that the Matthews area has lacked for some time. Tamarind's head chef as well, the man spares no expense and overlooks not even the smallest detail regarding restaurant operation. Expectedly, this makes for a smooth and polished dining experience, complemented only further by excellently trained staff who are equally passionate about the cuisine, not to mention attentive yet very chill. With comparatively mild prices for consistently solid-quality food offerings all wrapped up in an intimate and minimally stylistic atmosphere, I honestly can no longer justify the extra effort nor expense to dine at my former go-to Charlotte Indian spot, The Blue Taj in the Queen City's Ballantyne neighborhood. Even despite Tamarind's lack of a buffet altogether, Bhim and his team's culinary mastery more than make up for this slight disappointment.  Tamarind's \"Express Lunch\" items (served w/ naan, basmati + soup/salad) range from $9 veg to $12 non-veg. May I suggest ordering one from each; you'll walk away with sizeable leftovers. As for dinner, you'll probably be surprised as I was by how many difficult-to-find-in-Charlotte dishes Tamarind offers - Phaldari Chaat, Bhuna Kaleja, Nizami Naan, Baigan Bhartha, Dhaniya Gosht... to name but a few.  If you're trying to ditch the common \"Chicken Tikka Masala scene\" I highly recommend the following appetizers, naan, veg + non-veg plates, and desserts, respectively: $8 Rasila Gobi (veg app... crispy cauliflower tossed w/ mustard seeds in a tangy tomato sauce), $10 Chicken Kali Mirch (non-veg app... boneless white chicken tossed w/ garam masala, black pepper signature sauce), $4 Apricot Butter Naan, $11 Stuffed Shilma Mirch (veg... roasted bell pepper stuffed w/ spiced potato, topped w/ a tomato curry), $12 Tofu Mango Subzi (veg... tofu w/ mixed veg + fresh mango in a signature sauce), $24 Chaap (non-veg tandoori dish served w/ bhuna mixed veg + in-house tomato-cilantro chutney... gently hammered lamb chop marinated in a cashew & almond spiced yogurt), $8 Dessert Sampler (gulab jamun, kheer, kulfi).  Tamarind's spice scale ranges from 1 to 4, and while 1 and 2 [at least in my opinion] provide no \"kick\" whatsoever, 4 will push it for those who don't frequent Indian food. 3 is where it's at. And Tamarind's where you'll be exactly 30 minutes after reading this review. (Unless it's Mon... only day they're closed!) Namaste.  Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... - Overall recommendation = 4.5 - Food taste and quality = 4.5 - Food variety = 4.25 - Portion size = 4 - Price = 3.5 - Atmosphere = 4.75 (free WiFi too!) - General service = 5+ - Waitstaff = 5+ - Location = 4",

The hostess/waitress was so polite and went out of her way to help us as it was our first time at an Indian restaurant.   My husband picked something right away. A chicken dish in a very yummy curry sauce.  I wasn't able to decide, I told the waitress I was wanting something with coconut curry and tofu, she said the chef could come up with something special for me if I'd like, so of course that was perfect.    We got rosemary Naan, first, it was fantastic. UT was served with 3 sauces..  both my husband and I loved the tamarind and green sauces, but didn't like the white one at all.  We were both so happy when our food came out.  We each tried both of them.  I was so happy with my dish. It was heaven on my plate.  The perfect blend of coconut, curry, heat, tofu and vegetables. It couldn't have been better!!    And the rice.  Oh my gosh, the rice itself was the most fragrant, best tasting rice I've ever had.  To top it all off, after we were done, the chef came out to check how our food was. He was wonderful to speak to, we can't wait to go back.",

On one occasion, the kitchen was slightly backed up. Without a single complaint from us, the owner brought us an appetizer and apologized for the wait. We were seriously impressed. The food is always delicious. My favorite is the methi chicken and my husband loves the paneer dishes. They are having some financial trouble now, so they've had to cut the menu back and change the way you order (now orders are taken at the counter). The ordering doesn't bother me at all, but it's a shame that the menu had to get slashed. The only way to fix that is to get more people to eat there. If you want delicious Indian food, try Tamarind. If you want to see good Indian food stay in Matthews, support Tamarind by eating there and recommending it to friends and family.",

The chicken tikka masala wasn't the best I've had, but it did hit some aromatic notes of saffron and other spices that are signature to a well made tikka masala sauce.   I normally order a garlic naan to wrap little bites of chicken, rice, and sauce in, but their naan was extremely oily. Even after dabbing it with a paper towel, it was still a little too soggy to eat. Luckily the rice was tasty, and the chutney was good!!   Food is a bit pricy, but that seems to be a trend among Indian food establishments. Nothing too out of the ordinary...  (And in the restaurant's defense, I did order about 15 minutes from closing time. The oily naan may have been an attempt at reheating a naan made earlier that day. Will give them the benefit of the doubt and go back for a dine-in experience.)   Looking forward to trying more of their dishes at a future date!!",

I've been all over the country and tastes all sorts of dishes but this specific restaurant brings shame to authentic Indian Cuisine.  I was flying in from Boston this specific day and as soon as I landed, I wanted to get Indian food. I looked for a good restaurant around and was happy to read all the great reviews on yelp about Tamarind. So I decided to grab a bite for me and my friend from there. I ordered a chicken Tikka Masala w. side of Lentil Soup and a Aloo Gobi Matar w. a side of salad for pickup.  I arrived there 15minutes later and was asked to wait a few minutes while the naan bread was being prepared- no problem. I sat outside and the lady at the front happily brought my order out when it was ready. So far so good. I was anxious to go home and try the food.  When I got home. I opened the bag and was disappointed with the serving size. The chicken tikka masala looked like it had been scrapped out from the pot and only halfway full in the plastic container it came in. The lentil soup came in a half- cup container and the salad would literally have fit the palm of my hand. I tried to ignore it and make the best of it regardless of that but, when I opened the rice container I was disgusted to find a piece of hair inside. I threw out the rice and ate the bread and chicken but as hungry as I was, I really need a good meal. I didn't bother to call the restaurant to complain or anything because they were not even worth it. I don't understand how these people have such a high rating on here- I'm sure the people are paid to write good reviews or something.  I wouldn't waste my money and energy on this place if I were you.",

It all felt very zen considering the place is in a strip mall right off Independence Blvd. in Matthews.   Their lunch specials can't be beat! $11 got me a delicious bowl of lentil soup, as much rice and naan as I could eat and a piping hot bowl of chicken tikka masala amazingness. Everything was great but the highlight for me was really the naan. Nothing better than scooping up a spicy (I ordered my tikka masala medium, so I suppose it wasn't even THAT spicy) masala sauce with a soft, warm, buttery piece of naan. Mmmmmmmm!

It is crispy rice, with a cured sausage, cilantro, mint, basil, chilli flakes, peanuts, and lime juice. It had a nice little tingle from the chilli flakes and so many layers of flavor. I highly recommend it. My wife had Panang curry with pork, it is a coconut red curry with lime leaves, basil, red peppers, green beans and bamboo shoots, it had a little more heat than my dish but once again the depth of flavors was amazing.

I would Absolutely be friends with Him on FB (I'm NOT on FB though) but if I were!  This Chaat was Delicious!  Bread BREAD and More Bread AND I could have eaten even MORE Bread!  We Devoured this Bread and though I'm not on the Paleo Diet nor the NeoPaleo Diet I could be, until, Until, well...OK I LOVE Bread!  We had ONE Dish with Meat and we could have easily gone Vegetarian for a Meal or even a week eating here!!!  It was great seeing Bhim and hearing the part of the Story we had not heard after he moved from the Blue Taj to Peresis to then picking a spot for his own Indian Restaurant in a part of town with ZERO Competition and being the First (Geographically) Indian Restaurant you arrive at before hitting Charlotte if you are Traveling from Eastern North Carolina!  POPROCK LOVE and Alejandro and I had Dinner on a Thursday Night 6-8-2017 !  My NEVER on Thursday Rule is GONE!",

    "text": "I love Indian food and had been wanting to try Tamarind for a long time. I was EXTREMELY turned off the minute I walked in. The waitress at the door immediately asked me if we were \"Mark\" I said no and asked for a table for two. We were seated and went to order our drinks. My husband asked the difference between two beers and the very crass waitress told him one was like drinking a 40 of Old English. Ugh!   We ordered Somasas which were great. My husband had Tikki Marsala and I had the Chicken Sorpatel. I thought the food was excellent. The garlic naan was amazing.  The wait staff were AWFUL. Extremely crass and really not suited to this environment. I overhead another diner asking the waitress what something was and she answered \"I have no idea\". I'm sorry but if you are a wait person in a restaurant you need to know what everything on that menu is.   My husband and I both agreed we would definitely do take out from there as the food was excellent but didn't want to deal with that wait staff.",

    "text": "Starting draft...eating in progress.  Samosas best I have ever had.   Tamarind dipping sauce is wonderful and leaves a footprint on the back of your throat and your lips burn...just a bit.  Real beer flutes, somewhat unexpected in so casual of a place.  Very clean and just hard walls.  Nothing fancy.  They have the 22 ounce bottles of Kingfisher beer, a nice lager which goes perfectly with Indian food.  And it is enough for two...or just one if you are that thirsty.  And there are only a few tables.  I think about 24 seats, so not a place for a large group.  In face they only had one six place table, three two tops and the rest in four seats.  I am not crazy about samosa appetizers, but wife is, so we ordered a order which is two.  It seemed to take a long time, but afterward as we were both raving about how good they were, found out that they are made from scratch.  THEY WERE THE BEST SAMOSAS I HAVE EVER HAD.  And I have traveled a great deal to Indianland cities and locales.  They mix the ingredients so it is like a mash, rather than the potato chunks with peas and carrots.  Perfectly deep fried and served mouth burning hot, their goodness makes you wonder why other places don't make them that way.  For certain:  order the samosas.  I do not think you will regret it a bit.  Main courses we ordered Gia/Goan shrimp curry and coconut curry chicken.  Spice levels are 1-4 with 4 = Vindaloo.  We ordered level 3.  The shrimp dish was flavorful, but very simple:  just nice sized shrimp (about 7) in a tomato sauce sprinkled with coconut and garlic.  Served with rice so you can soak up the sauce.  Had plain naan also, so we filled up nicely.  The coconut chicken was very simple.  Just chicken chunks in a creamy sauce.  Was not very coco-nutty.  Wife poured some tamarind sauce which the waitress brought without asking and that brought out more flavor from both her chicken dish and my shrimp.  I guess that is why it is called \"Tamarind.\"   And...the tamarind took the edge off of the level three spice.  I would not want to take on level four.  Three was fine, but if you are the least bit spooked about Indian spice level, start with level two.   We agreed that even though this was our first visit, that they deserved four stars.  We were there before 6pm and there was only one table of two eating.  When we left, we counted 12 people, including we two and there were a number of take-away orders picked up.    This is a hidden gem.",

My wife and I have visited most of the Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area and we were excited to visit one in our backyard of Matthews. When we arrived we were seated immediately and the servers and host were very friendly. The restaurant is very small with maybe 10 tables. We wanted to order a bottle of wine but we found out they didn't have an alcohol license but they had applied for one. No worries. But for those looking to have an alcoholic drink with their meal will be disappointed. We ordered our food. I ordered a Samosa for an appetizer. For our meals my wife ordered a vegetable curry, and I ordered lamb along with Garlic Naan. We specifically asked for both meals to be spicy. The samosa soon arrived and it was very tasty. However when our meals arrived, we were very disappointed. Both meals were very bland and absolutely had no spice at all. The Naan didn't taste good as well. The restaurant was busy. I tried to flag down our server and was unsuccessful. We were so hungry we decided to go ahead and finish our meals. Our server did not visit us at all during our meals. I finally was able to flag her down to get our check.",

    "text": "ATTENTION YELPERS: You HAVE to put Tamarind Fine Cuisine of India on your Go-To list soon! We visited them yesterday (Sunday) evening, based solely upon previous glowing Yelp reviews. The 5-star rating is very well-deserved. Not a single disappointment. Nada! Thanks, my fellow Yelpers! You've done us a solid.  We shared:  - Garlic Naan (light, flavorful, delicious) - Saag Paneer (off-menu, but Chef Bhim made it for us on request - spectacular!) - Chicken Tikka Masala (in a word, awwesomme!!!) - Dhaniya Gosht (an absolutely superb, vibrantly flavored goat stew) - Basmati Rice (cooked to perfection) - Sweet Tea (\"just right\", not too sweet. No beer/wine yet)  Hey, I've eaten Indian food for 40 years. I deem myself well-qualified to say that Tamarind is literally off the charts! Virtually everything was \"best of breed\". When we walked through the door, the subtle aromas of fenugreek, garam masala and tandoor cooking were readily apparent - indeed, a very good sign - foodstuffs were being prepared FRESH! Yes, they do have a genuine tandoor clay oven, and they know how to use it. Just try the Chicken Tikka Masala and you'll know exactly what I mean. The chicken is first cooked in the tandoor oven, then combined with the sauce and hit with a finishing spice mix. Yesss!  I truly respect and appreciate that Chef Bhim, a graduate of one of India's top culinary schools, has chosen to showcase foods from various regions of the country - including Goa, Kashmir, Kerala and Malabar). Plus, he's a very personable young man, taking time out to come chat with us about our experience and share his philosophy of food preparation - \"Don't play around with food. Maintain tradition and consistent quality\", a philosophy he executes beyond reproach, and one to which we ascribe wholeheartedly. His passion and loyalty shines through in every bite.  Tamarind serves both lunch and dinner Tue - Sun. The dinner menu features decidedly more dining options and offers a full compliment of vegetarian options, all clearly delineated, in addition to the many traditional non-vegetarian selections. They use a sliding scale from 1- 4 to dictate spiciness (heat). We chose \"3\", which was right on point for us. Portion sizes were generous (I just finished the leftovers for lunch) and prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity enjoyed.  Service was first rate all the way. Our server, Terry, is a real sweetheart. Wonderfully attentive without being overtly cloying. We look forward to many return visits to Tamarind, and we're sure that you will too after giving them a first try. DO IT!!!",

    "text": "We came to Tamarind based on some friends' high recommendations, and wow did it not disappoint. Super authentic indian flavors with the chefs own twist on traditional dishes. Chef Bhim Thapa does an excellent job of blending flavors from all regions of India, and you can tell from talking with him, that he is extremely passionate about what he does. The food was simply spot on. We ordered the Chicken Tikka and the Chicken Sorpatel, and I highly recommend both dishes...spectacular.  The apricot butter Naan was excellent, and the mango lassis were a perfect pairing with the heat of the curries we ordered.  While the place is small, you definitely get a very intimate experience when it comes to the staff and their care for their guests.  I really can't recommend Tamarind enough...the food is superior to other indian restaurants in and around the Charlotte area, and if you are close by, I would definitely encourage you to stop by and see what Bhim has cooking!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g49330-d8458556-r291923066-Tamarind_Fine_Cuisine_of_India-Matthews_North_Carolina.html&s=da2bff6549e3a4bc5641e51a0b06222d4a3efd6a84dae1c864b2d21024637dcf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

I should have told her that the rice wasn't cooked all the way and that the veggies were still raw in the Mango Tofu Subzi (she said it was her favorite). My husband liked his Rogan Josh, and it was decent, but you couldn't even enjoy it because of the crunchy rice. But I am not super familiar with Indian cuisine so I felt like I probably just should have asked more questions before I ordered. But then, halfway through our meal, the family next to us complained to the chef that the rice was hard and their food was not cooked all the way though. So, it wasn't just me. They had a lousy cook that night. Like i said, I should have been more vocal but I was just so hungry and I knew to wait for more rice to be made would take a while and I just wanted to get out of there. What a waste of a night out.",

I ordered the chicken marsala and samosas.. It came with naan white rice and yellow lentil soup.. The lentil soup was good but lacked salt. The chicken marsala was good.. Chicken was tender. I had a major problem with the naan. It taste like ny pizza bread with oil. Was very greasy not the naan I'm used to.. The samosa was something different as well. They use puff pastry not use to that either.. This place is not authentic Indian food but they tried it!  would I come back?? If I wanted Indian food and I have no other options... Yes because it's clean and safe.",

He goes and talks to all his customers, which is great.   I ordered a Methi Chicken after the manager recommended that to me. It was pretty good! I wanted a little more spices to make it more fragrant but all in all very delicious. The chicken was cooked really well. The food comes in mini pots, which I found adorable so it keeps the food warmer for a little longer. There are tons of vegetarian options as well! The definitely have their own twist in the menu when comparing to other Indian restaurants. ALWAYS get Naan.   The decor is beautiful, but the space is pretty small. It's very modern.",

I was seated immediately and did not wait long to place my order. First, I should not be eating this food due to dietary restrictions...but there are places I frequented in Chicago that I just really miss. An Indian restaurant is one of them. This will be my first time dining at an Indian restaurant in Charlotte and it did not disappoint.   I started with Somosa and Apricot Naan. Amazing! Good portion on both dishes. For my entree I went with the recommendation of Methi Chicken. Similar to Tikki Masala except simmered in a creamy fenugreek sauce. Served with a side of basmati rice. Excellent! Bursting with flavor and perfectly spiced to my liking. It was more than enough food for me. I ended up taking home leftovers and ordered naan to go.  Despite dietary restrictions, this is another place I will sneak meals from. If you know and appreciate real Indian Cuisine, then you will enjoy eating here. I'm sure some may feel the menu is not so large, but it does have the well known dishes that people tend to favor most.   Overall, it was a great dining experience. Food is truly delicious. Servers are attentive. Owner is engaged and checks on each table. He takes pride in this place and it shows.   The place is authentic and that matters most to me!",

Also got Pat Thai which was fine, but I've had better on that one.  Will definitely add this spot to the rotation.  Although it looks like the Naam Kao and Larb are no longer on the online order menu, hopefully that gets sorted out.",

My wife has been talking about bringing me here for a year after she previously visited twice.    I am so glad we tried it.  The salad was small and efficient, just the right size.  The naan was warm and crispy.  I could have just eaten a basket of the naan!  I had the tamarind chicken curry (#3 spicy) and my wife had the shrimp curry (#1).  Both were exceptional.  My curry was spicy enough I had a light sweat but the flavor was amazing.  My rice was cooked perfectly.  The portions were a perfect size.    I am looking forward to more visits as the curry was the best I have had in some time.",

The staff are very nice, going above and beyond to make sure everyone has a good experience. I'd definitely recommend for eat in or take out!",

I love the Gobi Matar Paneer Keema here but, no cubes. It's grown on me. The garlic naan here is a family favorite. My 9 year old loves the Subzi Daal Makhni (lentil stew) and Mango Lassi (me too!). I've never seen my kiddo eat so many vegetables in one sitting. My husband loves the Chicken Tikka Masala and Rogan Josh.   If I win the lottery I'm eating here every day. For now, I'll enjoy it as often as I can.",

Found this little gem by chance, as I was in the CPCC college area for an event, and me and a coworker were looking for a place to grab lunch after. Yelp suggested Tamarind, and we decided to drive down.  Walked in and we were greeted warmly by the hostess/server. We ordered the lamb rogan josh and the chicken tikka masala, and naan to go with it. The chicken tikka masala was probably among the top 5 that I've tasted. Delicately balanced gravy with a hint of tang from the tomato, and the chicken was perfectly cooked. The lamb Rogan Josh was pretty close to what you would find in the dhabas of Old Delhi. Made me reminisce. Enough said.  For dessert we had the kheer and the Gulab jamun. It seemed that they had just cooked the kheer, and it was still hot, and the milk and rice were separating. This was the one item on the menu that did not impress. The gulab jamun was yummy, sweet but not overly so.  After the meal, the chef/owner came out to greet us and I spent a few minutes talking to him. Overall, I had a good time, and Tamarind is another restaurant to add to my list of hole in the wall places with great food.",

Gotta love a place that's not afraid to make something spicy. 2) best naan I've had in a decade. Oh man, I'm coming back for another basket of that before we leave. 3) generous portions, especially rice! You get so much for $10-12!! 4) super fast service. 5) adorable ambiance.

This isn't just a great Indian restaurant....this is the best Indian restaurant I have been to in the U.S. or the UK. In fact they are one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The look, the feel, the personal attention and conversation with the chef are just amazing.  I have been a few times now. Everything I have tried is amazing in both taste and presentation. Even the classic that everyone knows chicken tikka masala, a dish you wouldn't think could be improved, is just somehow better than any I ever tried. All of their favors in all the food are just so vibrant and fresh and alive. You really taste the passion this chef has and the love for what he is trying to do with his restaurant.  I can not think of a single negative thing to say about it. I imagine soon, I may be complaining about wait times :-) I do want to see them succeed so I encourage everyone to try them and hope you also experience the pure dining bliss that I have enjoyed so far.",

I am not a huge fan of the location but hope they thrive and grow here.  Queen City needs Tamarind - world-class Indian food that beats perhaps some of the best in the UK and India too!  Tip: the samosas are made with fresh dough that is prepared on-site - resulting in a flaky, crisp and downright addictive crunch.  Do not miss the samosas - none of the frozen stuff fried in a hurry.  For those who have eaten samosas in 'gullies' of Delhi or Bombay, you will find something very similar right here in our city :-)",

They have some dishes we have never seen anywhere else. I tried the Malai Kofta (croquette potatoes in a creamy nut sauce). It was so good that I brought home the leftover sauce with rice to eat for lunch the next day. The owner/chef came out to talk with us for a few minutes to make sure we were satisfied with our meals. He gave us some background about the dishes and Indian food in general. It was a very enjoyable dining experience overall and we will definitely be going back.",

Downtown Monroe looks like it's undergoing a rebirth, and Thai Tamarind is one of a few good restaurants to move down there.  The menu is different. No more Pad Thai, but more Lao dishes! I got the yellow curry this time and it was fantastic.. my wife got the green curry, which I finished for her, which was also awesome! We also got some spring rolls which were outstanding.

We sat at one of the sidewalk tables, our first time to downtown Monroe and hadn't expected it to be as picturesque. The menu is the same Thai/Laotian street food, but I think with more choices . We tried five different dishes and couldn't agree on which was the best one. One was tastier than the next one and nothing was overspiced or too hot - the leftovers are in our fridge and I think I'll warm them up as soon as I finish this review.  Plus, at $10/12 per main plate, it was also rather inexpensive.   The owner sounded very enthusiastic with the move and we wish him success in his new home. To us, the drive was worth it and we'll certainly go back.",

The space in Monroe is small but they were able to accommodate our group of 14 in the back section of the restaurant. You order at the counter and they give you a number and bring your food to the table. Surprisingly there is no pad Thai on their standard menu. Some of our party \"pre ordered\" pad Thai - they make their sauces by hand daily and as it's not on the menu it does have to be requested before going. I ended up with the pad Thai and was very disappointed.  The chicken. Was very offputting and looked like it had been taken through a bad beating before ending up on my plate. The spring rolls were very good and I would get those again.",

The primary difference is that rather than being a more traditional sit-down restaurant, you instead are presented (somewhat abruptly, it's right as you walk in) with menus and asked to order. This isn't too terribly different than any Chinese fast food place - except here it's just a menu. Nothing in a steam table, no menus on the wall, no pictures of food you aren't likely to get, no open kitchen. Just BAM! (and no Emeril Lagasse either, but you probably didn't need to be told.)  Assuming you get past that, the descriptions on the menu are not bad - simply order what sounds good - and it all sounds good - pay, and a few minutes later you will get your food.   Unlike many Thai places around, you do not get to choose your heat level, but instead get what they serve. However, they will bring out a tray where you can adjust it to your own level. This includes chili flakes, crushed peanuts and sugar. Definitely an interesting touch, but different.  All in all the food was some very tasty stuff and worth a visit.",

I was so excited when I saw nam kao on the menu since their aren't any restaurants serving that dish in the area and it's one of my fav! The nam Kao was one of the main reason I came in when I did too.  This is definitely going to be one of our favorite go-to restaurant when we eat out. Don't forget to stop by if you're in the area and if you're willing to make the trip from the other side of town, you won't regret it!

Most of tandoori chickens I tried before, you don't get moist meat inside usually. guess it is from how cook the tandoori chicken. Methi chicken was quite spicy to me but it was tasty. Nice creamy and spicy taste, will good for spicy food lover. Kairi chicken is a curry with raw mango and I liked it. I forgot to take photo but their garlic nann was good too.

Please help keep this small business in business by ordering at the front desk before sitting down, and not staying for an unreasonably long time. He needs to be able to turn tables in order to make money in this small space.   The GREEN CURRY with vegetables was so well seasoned, spicy and fully of regular and unusual veggies. Home run.   CHICKEN WITH PEANUT SAUCE was my least favorite but my mom (who ordered it and likes peanut sauce) loved it. For me it had a touch too much of either fish or oyster sauce in the peanut sauce for me to appreciate it.   EXPLODING CATFISH was pretty simple, with ultra thin little fillets of fish very heavily breaded and fried to create a crunchy base and then topped with a spicy mango salad. Usually I'm not a fan of sweet + savory. And I definitely don't like fruit in my entrees. But this worked very well together. It felt fresh and decadent at the same time.   I ordered PAD THAI for my 3 yr old, since everything else we ordered was spicy, and it ended up being my favorite. Full of veggies - broccoli, zucchini, carrot, red pepper - with a perfectly balanced sauce to the noodles. It comes with a little heap of sugar, crushed peanuts and a few other things to personalize it if you want. I found it excellent as is.   We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I LOVE THIS PLACE!  I've seen other reviewers slamming this restaurant lately because of the change in service; I think they're crazy.   Tamarind is a TINY (8-12 tables) restaurant tucked away in the Matthews Festival shopping center. It's right beside Miracle Ear and Big Lots. The owner/operator is friendly, chatty, and always there. He's Nepalese and the food at the restaurant is Indian with a Nepalese influence.  The restaurant used to be a straight-forward dine-in set-up, but because of low volume during the work week they've gone to counter service and pared down their menu (think Showmars-like service). They chose their most popular dishes from the longer menu (which really wasn't that much bigger) and the quality is still REALLY good. The prices may have changed, but, honestly they're still really low for quality curry ($11-$15).  My husband and I typically start with somosas and then order from the vegetarian side of the menu (our favorites are Gobi Matar Paneer Keema and Paneer Makhani), along with some naan. Each curry has a spice rating of 1-4 (from mild to Indian spicy). The service is quick and kind and your curries are delivered in their own pots, so that you know they were cooked to order. I've seen other diners slam the rice. I have never had a problem with it, and honestly, rice is the last thing I'm concerned with as long as the curry is good. They have a decent wine menu and a few beers, as well.   We were able to get two curries, an appetizer, naan and wine last night for $47. That is the same that we spend at local pizza places for a large pizza, wings and two beers and this is INFINITELY better.  For folks that are worried about random closings (this is a small family business) - call ahead. Their new set-up has an uptick, as well - takeout is much easier.  Ignore the haters and give this place a chance! It is well worth it!",

Now for the dishes: The green curry was freshly prepared and the meat are very tender. Spicy Lime Pork was very fresh and spicy. Pad Thai was authentic and not too sweet. It would be great if they have the option for shrimp and/or tofu pad Thai. I love that they gave us extra crushed peanut on the side to garnish our pad Thai.",

The food was so delicious that I will be back very soon and bring my kids.  So convenient to Unionville - I highly recommend - exceptional food with comfortable/casual atmosphere.",

The Moo Ma Now is especially refreshing including the fresh chilly made it such an appetizing dish. If you want to find really authentic Pad Thai, then you have come at the right place. Their pad thai doesn't use ketchup, instead they use tamarind. No sugar added, they put sugar on the side, in case you still want to add. The beef in the green curry was perfectly cooked, it's soft but yet having such a rich flavor. We'll definitely come back, there is another dish that the owner think we would love, the Kao Poon, supposed to be the authentic spicy Lao style red curry. Oh, the owner is super nice. too This place is such a gem in Charlotte. Authentic. Fresh. Friendly owner.",

    "text": "Went for the first time yesterday night (in fact pretty late and we were the last customers) and pleasantly surprised.  Of course yelp said it's a pretty good place.  At first, looking at the menu there was a slight disappointment because they do not serve biriyani :) but no you will not regret.  Their menu is unique, not your regular indian restaurant menu, it had some Nepalese influence as well.  anyways, no biriyani, so we ordered chicken tikka masala (thought it would be a safe bet in a new place).  ONE OF THE BEST tasting tikka masala we ever had.  The kind of spice they use is the magic I believe, its like its not too spicy like your mouth is burning but that kind of spicy where you would want to eat more.   Of course I had to tell my feelings over the tikka masala to the chef, lol.   Bheem/Bhim (bear with the spelling) head chef/owner is a great guy, full of passion about cooking and very down to earth person.  Looks like he had great experience in hand working for multiple restaurants and finally opened up his own.  Since we were the last customer he had enough time to talk to us for sometime and explained about his menu, his approach towards his restaurant, how he wants to stand apart from other indian restaurant etc., and you know what, Tamarind does not apart from other Indian restaurants in the area, to start with they don't server buffet lunch here, for one I feel its way classier, trying to not make quantity but wants to retain quality.  They don't serve biriyani (kind of a bummer) but in a way its great coz of the reasons he told us about.  Pretty sure we would want to go again and try those receipes that he personally suggested and are best sellers of his restaurant.  Funny thing is to be honest he said he doesn't care much for chicken tikka masala because its a boring dish LOL. :-|",

We both love Indian food, but don't get it nearly enough since we moved to Charlotte.    Tamarind was incredible from the moment we walked in the door.  The staff was friendly as well as knowledgeable of the menu items.  Without asking, our waitress suggested sauces to compliment our appetizer/nan choices.  She was very attentive and helpful.  Even the chef came out to check on how we were enjoying our meal as well as the service.  Further, the price was spot on for the portions as well!  But most of all, the food, was delicious!  Even though we do not live in this area of Charlotte, we will definitely be returning to Tamarind!",

Excellent, as they arrived very hot, and had a delightful cinnamon flavour to the crust.  Our main dishes were Gobi Matar Peneer Keema, and Chicken Sorpatel. The Gobi Matar Peneer Keema was an amazing vegetarian dish, that now is one of our favorite all-time Indian dishes. And, the Chicken Sorpatel was perfect, as it didn't have too much coconut that sometimes can overpower the dish.  Our waiter was the owner, the Head Chef, which we hadn't realized until we began ordering. He made the evening a more memorable experience, explaining each dish in detail, and where the spices and influences for each dish was from.  We have found our new Indian restaurant!",

Put me out of my comfort zone but I had one of the best meals I've had in a long time. They have a HUGE selection of vegetarian choices too.   Started with a chili garlic naan and a Somosa which were both awesome, if I had room after my entree I would have ordered another round. I think the pastry for the Somosa was made there.   For an entree I opted for lamb tamarind curry. The portion was huge and came with the traditional rice. My one complaint is I wanted it hot and maybe I looked like I couldn't handle the heat but it wasn't hot. They sent out some spice and pepper for me to add and it definitely fired it up.  This place is small and quant and decorated nicely. Service was really on point. One of the things I love is they bring a big decanter of water at the table. I love my food hot and feel awkward sometimes when a server has to constantly full my glass.   This is a place I strongly recommend and I will be back to try some other things on the menu.",

The service is super great, with the owner of the place often being there and checking on your table. The cauliflower appetizer, Dahl, and all the other vegetarian options I've had are great! Lunch was reasonably priced. Dinner is more expensive, but there's plenty to take home. #hopefulregular",

Don't be put off by the location! Tamarind has a great atmosphere that attracts the age 30+ crowd. The menu is interesting -- heavy on lamb dishes and not just the standard Indian fare. The tandoori paneer is a super second dish aside any meat entree. Prices are reasonable.   As of 7/24/15, Tamarind had posted a sanitary grade of 94. That's as low a rating as I'll accept for any restaurant. I checked the inspection report and the small point subtractions were not alarming. Nonetheless, I'd like to see a ServeSafe certification attained by the next time I dine and a rating of 98 or above.",

I ordered take-out once and they forgot my nan. The called me back and apologized and assured me next time I ordered or came in they would give me free nan. They didn't disappoint as the next time around they remembered me and came through on their promise.   I highly recommend this restaurant.",

The owner of the restaurant is charming and delightful to speak with. The service was attentive without being obtrusive. They make you feel like you are part of the family and made my husband's birthday all the more special. The restaurant is intimate and inviting with a very high level of hospitality.  The owner, Bin,  is always on hand to ensure that your wishes and needs are met and he's a wonderful host.

The photos and reviews from other customers were enough to initially entice me, so my husband and I decided to try it out. I'm so thankful we did, because we were blown away with the clean and simple design, the INCREDIBLE, TASTY food, and the overall presentation and atmosphere. The hostess/waitress was very helpful and sweet. The owner/head chef (not sure if he was the head chef, but we think he was) even came and checked on us and let us know/apologized about the deliveries being taken through the front since they don't have a back loading area and the truck arrived earlier than normal. We weren't even upset, but he wanted to make sure we were okay with it - how considerate! We left wondering why in the world we hadn't gone sooner?!?! We are so excited about Tamarind and hope they never leaves Matthews/Charlotte...we will be frequenting for lunch and date nights very often!",

The sweet greetings at the door, the beautiful yet simple table accents and decor, and the savory first bite all gave a sense of homey comfort.   I ordered the Methi Chicken per the waitress' recommendation. It came with a side salad, basmati rice, the curry bursting with aromatic flavors, and the best naan bread I've ever encountered. As I simmered adrift the comfort of the meal, the hostess/waitress consistently came to make sure everything was perfect. At the end of my meal, the owner/chef came out to ask if I enjoyed my experience. He was sweet and accommodating, grabbing boxes for my leftovers (as he saw the waitress was busy), and slowly told me about his dream. He grew up in India and simply wanted to share his love for cooking, making sure to get to know the guest, and in turn provide them with the right dish for their palate. To say I love Tamarind would be an understatement. I felt a sense of home with the love that radiated from both the food and the wonderful people that handled its craft. Can't wait to come back!

    "text": "I really really really really really wanted to love this place.  Trust me.  I was willing to go to great lengths to love it.  The fact that it has all 5 star reviews from a ton of people that have less than 5 reviews total is a little concerning and shady in my opinion.    Nonetheless, I am writing only in hopes that the management will take note so they can improve!  The place is small, awkwardly quiet and not really cozy by any means.    The service was friendly, slow but friendly.  The rice was good, the naan was good.  The chicken however was not cooked through.  We had a couple different curry dishes and I cut into a couple pieces that literally had pink on the inside.  If it was a piece of steak then I wouldn't have minded.  But this was chicken.  Chicken under NO circumstance should be pink in the center.  Ever.  Never.    So, needless to say that pretty much ruined my meal.  I tried a few other pieces that tasted suspicious so I really couldn't enjoy the meal.  The sauce was good and I was hungry but that still didn't make up for the wobbly, chewy, slimy, uncooked chicken.  Please correct this and I will gladly come back.  I would love to have a great indian restaurant in Matthews!",

This place is unique in that since he's revamped the menu they have several Tibetan dishes along with the more typical Northern Indian dishes. Fair sized portions, so-so prices, but really tasty food. The interior is nice and comfortable and staff are A-okay (they certainly tolerated my toddler well (he made a game out of reorganizing the sugar packets). Overall, good place and we look forward to returning, especially if they have a weekend buffet (that could be interesting).",

Refrigerator temperature apricot jelly spread on four pieces of Naan, which were then stacked into a big gooey mess.  Inedible.  But they were kind enough to take it off the bill.  The Tamarind Lamb Curry was good, but lacked the depth of flavor that good Indian food has.",

As vegan eaters, we depend upon someone knowing the menu (and all of the ingredients) to ensure that our meal is prepared correctly (minus any animal products). Tamarind staff are very helpful and have made each of our visits a pleasure.   Excellent value. Small restaurant but cozy. In an \"out of the way\" location but well worth a visit. You will not be disappointed!!",
