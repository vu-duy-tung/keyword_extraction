    "text": "Love Enrico's. This place is probably the most legit pizza place in Charlotte, especially in the steel creek area. I have eaten here a couple times, but normally stick to take out. My family has tried the pizza (pepperoni), Stromboli (regular), and wings (blackened and texmex). We love that their wings are nice and crispy and so flavorful! And the Stromboli is oozing with deliciousness . The pizza is very good as well. They put the right amount of sauce and I like that the pepperoni is made of beef and not pork. If they keep up with the quality that I've seen so far, I'm sure this place will remain/ become a staple for many others.",

    "text": "I had been meaning to dine at Enrico's for some time but finally visited recently.  The restaurant exterior is beautiful, the interior is simple and charming, and the patio is small but attractive.  I dined outside on the patio.  The menu has plenty of selections but none that really jumped out me.  I wanted mussels but it is served with a red sauce, when asked, the kitchen said they could use a garlic and lemon sauce instead which was appealing.  The pizza sizes were too large for a single diner so I opted to forego that.  The calzone and stromboli were appealing but I did not like the price point.  The shrimp scampi appetizer seemed amazing but the entree size had different ingredients that did not appeal to me.  However, the party seated next to me were served spaghetti that looked good and smelled incredible.  Ultimately, I selected the shrimp appetizer but has an entree size with a Caesar salad and cup of hot water.    I had to request silverware and received a black cloth napkin which I liked.  However, when I unraveled the napkin, it had hair and crumbs on it.  The replacement was utensils wrapped in a paper napkin, which was ok but I preferred a clean fresh smelling black cloth napkin.  I received the cup of water, inserted a tea bag but it never steeped.  When I checked the water is was lukewarm and lipstick was on the cup.  When I was finally able to reach my service I asked for very hot water in a clean cup.    I receive the Caesar salad but the dressing had an overwhelming taste of mayo that I did not care for.  Also, it did not have croutons and I really wish they were included.  I received my entree while I was still eating the salad.  I wish many restaurants did a better job of timing the courses.  After finishing the salad, I moved to the entree of shrimp scampi.  When I tell you it was a gorgeous dish, believe me.  The fettucine pasta was light, the sauce was plentiful with lots of flavor, the shrimp were big and beautiful; I could not have asked for more.  Also, the entree was served with warm rolls and butter.  I was in heaven and savored every bite.  Although I loved my entree, I gave the restaurant 4 out of 5 stars because my server.  The server was not attentive, it seemed as though I was a bother to her, at the end of my dinner a different server came to me to say my initial server had an emergency and left which was fine because she wasn't of much help to me.  The deduction of one star is also because of the salad dressing, dirty napkin, unclean cup, and lukewarm water.  Will return to Enrico's, heck yeah.  Do I recommend Enrico's to others, definitely.",

Tiramisu claimed to be homemade but there was a distinct \"old fridge\" taste that may haunt me for awhile....it was not well put together lacking in the lady fingers soaked in coffee (or coffee liquor) and surely no mascapone either.

After some False advertisement on their website of 20% off if ordering online, I was treated very unprofessionally by the management staff. When I went inside the store to try to communicate the issue that I was having with the online ordering system, I was surprised by the disrespectful communication from the management. In lieu of offering some compensation for my inconvenience, I was confronted with yelling and very unprofessional behavior from the staff. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in an attempt to assist this organization with better transparency in advertising and False advertising tactics. I was very disappointed, as their food is absolutely wonderful! I believe that their staff could use some training on professionalism and courteous customer service. If consideration for there patrons were more positive and professional, I would absolutely give them five stars.",

    "text": "I see a lot of 4 and 5 star ratings for this restaurant. While this is a fine place to eat, it doesn't stand out. The first thing I noticed was the interior has some nice design to it, but the floor is tile and that makes the sound level in the restaurant pretty high. I felt like this would be a great brewery or tap room, not a sit down restaurant. The loudness was probably the most distinctive thing about my meal. Since they recently opened, they only had 4 red wine options and 2 beers (no draft). The waitress said they were soon to get 3 local craft beers. Hopefully that happens, because a place without a local craft beer option, is off the list.  We were seated promptly when we arrived. There was no wait line. We had immediate service. That was good. They have a decent selection of appetizers, the waitress recommended Calamari, so we had that. The Calamari was typical, not outstanding, not a lot of flavor, but also not fried to death, so it was A-ok. (3 stars) We had a bottle of wine, selected from the 4 options. It was fine. Next to the menu! They had a large selection of dishes. Lots of pasta options, pizza, Calzones, Stromboli, and other entrees as well. I had Premivera with Broccoli, mushrooms, Spinach in a cream sauce and I added Meatballs. It was fairly priced and tasted A-ok. It wasn't super tasty. It wasn't really memorable. But not terrible either. Now, it was a YUGE portion. It was easily 4x what I could eat. I always hate going to a place, eating my fill, and then realizing, it looks like I barely touched my main dish. I can't imagine anyone eating a full portion. Similar experience from my family. Portions were very large, quality and taste were A-ok, but not outstanding. To Dessert! We got a Tiramishu and a cheese cake. Both, again, A-ok. So, in conclusion. This isn't a bad place, its a fine place, and we need a new place in this area. However, I wouldn't make this a date night location. Its a solid 3 stars.",

We came across a few issues with our order but the waitress did not hesitate on helping us out. - The food was alright. Really would be nice to have fresh veggies and not those from a can.   I was kind of looking forward to eating a more authentic/homemade meal.  I would recommend visiting Enrico's for an appetizer and drinks.   I have been to Papa Sammy's Pizza in Mount Holly, NC and food is way better. The variety of food is not as extensive as the food listed on Enrico's menu but at least many of the food items are homemade and there are many fresh ingredients in their dishes.",

Mama Ricotta's is outstanding, but I have yet to find another Italian restaurant I would say is even above average.   The decor has a nice modern rustic feel to it. There was no wait and only a handful of people there when we went. The service was fast and friendly.   You get a ton of food. You start with bread, which I thought was pretty good. All of the pasta dishes come with a side salad. They used a spring mix which I'm always a fan of and the balsamic vinaigrette was very good. The portions of the pasta dishes are huge. It would definitely make sense to split them between two people. We got the penne vodka and the gnocchi. Both were pretty good. I wouldn't say they were outstanding, but good solid pasta dishes. My friend got the Sorrento and it was very fresh and pretty good as well.  We finished with the seasonal sweet potato maple cheesecake which was delicious!  This isn't a place I would rave about, but it was definitely enjoyable and raises the bar for restaurants in Steele Creek and Italian restaurants in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Great food and service, huge portions  My wife and I went here for dinner tonight.  We like trying new restaurants, and I am so glad we gave this one a shot.  The location is convenient and the ambience is great.  It is a tad loud in there because of the concrete floors and all of the glass, but it is not a big deal.  My family previously owned an Italian restaurant so I am picky when it comes to Italian food.  The meal was EXCELLENT!!  The fried calamari appears to be double dredged before being cooked and they were excellent.  I had the Arrabiata and it had so many flavors going on at once, but they all worked great together.  I am not usually even a red sauce fan but theirs was flavorful with just a great hint of spice, and the prosciutto, olives and mushrooms put it over the edge.  My wife had the linguini and clam sauce.  There had to be 15-20 huge clams in the shell in it still (vs. other restaurants that just used canned clams).  It was flavorful and fresh and she can't wait to eat the leftovers because linguini with clam sauce is always better the next day.  Speaking of leftovers....the portions are huge.  We have a full serving of calamari still left, and over half of each of our dinners (which came with soup or salad).  The meal total for the big app, 2 big dinners with soup/salad, 2 beers and a glass of wine was around $60.  GREAT value.    Can't wait to go back.  A diamond in the rough and the best Italian food we have had in Charlotte (and we have been to many Italian restaurants in town).",

Piccata is terrible has no flavor at all. The pizza not a fan tried both styles and it's too salty and some seasoning on there I don't care for. The only thing that's awesome are the cannoli!

First time my husband and I ordered lasagna and baked ziti; we usually don't eat these dishes so it was hard to gauge how tasty it was...I would say it was good, not bad and not the best. Service was slow however they had just opened that weekend so pass there.   This time i ordered linguine in white clam sauce...LOVED it, could've used more pasta though was my only complaint. The clams and sauce were delicious. Got a Manhattan clam chowder with it...SO good with plentiful clams. (I was feeling clammy). Husband got a pizza; he didn't like it- sauce and dough were not how he likes his pizza. My brother got a Philly cheesesteak with fries, he said it wasn't bad however not the best. service was attentive however got slow at the end when it came to paying/waiting for card back which can be bothersome especially when you're full and ready to go. I will definitely be back to taste other items on the menu...still thinking about the clam sauce!",

Patio is a nice addition although the small lawn allowed patrons to let their kids run and shout- not conducive to a grown up quiet dinner. Server was friendly and attentive and knew the menu. Bread could have been served with a plate for dipping. Both olive oil and salad dressing were served in cheap plastic tubs- it would be classier and more environmentally friendly to use a nicer reusable bowl. Shrimp pasta special was amazing! Veal Saltimbocca was less so. Prosciutto was more like thick Canadian bacon, and the whole thing was covered in a huge gooey wad of bland mozzarella and spinach. Put on a large bed of spaghetti- the whole dish seemed thrown together, and like a tacky version of what could be a tasty Italian favorite. We will go back for sure, but might stick with local favorites like pizza and pasta. I don't think I would risk disappointment by trying the more traditional Italian trattoria fare. With some work this can be a real gem!",

I had the lasagna, which was not made like a traditional one, but was extremely tasty and fresh. My wife had the blackened chicken special and it was done perfectly as well.

I ordered linguine and meatballs and the entire dish lacked flavor. My cousins ordered Shrimp Scampi and Alfredo. With every bite we were adding salt and the only option for cheese to top our dishes was powdered parm. But I will says, the crab and artichoke dip was AMAZING!   Drinks: We orders the special, a Berry Pearl Martini. Oh gosh, it was glorified snow cone syrup with jelly pearls you would find in bubble tea with a splash of alcohol. Not good.   Thankful the service was good! My poor cousin was sick the rest of the night and into the morning with a rolling stomach.   Maybe pass on this restaurant until they decided to just do pizza.",

I got a Sicilian pizza which was incredible and could feed an army, a Caesar salad which was perfect, and The crab dip which came with the most delicious garlic bread. I was also really happy with how the order was packaged because I had everything I needed. I will definitely be ordering from them again the food was great!",

Service was not good...... server did not introduce herself, did not offer a pasta selection, had to ask for things twice for example to go boxes. They started mopping the floors at 9:30 and it is hard to eat with strong clean odors soooo strong as soon as I put my food in the to go box I was outside to breathe. Need a liquor menu why have full bar.but no menu. The server could not find the manager  when we had issues with the bill. The veal parmigiana and Baked ziti was good but the salmon dish my friend had was cold.",

An IPA from Green Man Brewery out of Asheville was on tap and FCA IPA bottled from Railhouse Brewery out of Aberdeen! I liked the Green Man best! We ordered the Crab and Spinach Dip for an appetizer. It came with garlic bread. In my opinion, it was a tad too soupy but the flavor was good. Not much crab or spinach though. I ordered Gnocchi and my daughter ordered Alfredo. Both were excellent with plenty to bring home. We ordered three cannolis to go and they were awesome! We sat at the bar and service could not have been any better! Next time I'm at the Charlotte Premium Outlets, I'll definitely stop by to eat and drink again. I highly recommend this place before or after shopping!",

Thought entree should have been comped.  Served very apologetic.  Owner couldn't be bothered to come apologize.   Despite the decent tasting food, won't give this establishment another nickel.

The cheese bread was lightly melted mozzarella with bites of real garlic on cut up Italian bread and served with a marinara that was made for dipping this. This marinara had a different taste than the baked ziti sauce. This impresses me because that is attention to detail.   Different dishes have different flavor filled sauces. This is important when ordering Italian dishes.   I ordered from UberEats. Thank you for delivery! I'm in my 18-wheeler so unique places other than pizza that deliver is always welcomed because I can't drive to many of these restaurants in that big ol body.",

We were sat and greeted right away.  The service was meh...the waiter seemed a little out of it and slow.  He got a few things on our order wrong, which was slightly annoying, but tolerable.    I ordered eggplant parm and meatballs.  It comes with bread and a side salad.  Also we tried the calamari for an appetizer.  The calamari was good, the marinara for dipping was up to my standards and even had chunks of garlic in it.  I really enjoyed the marinara further on my main dish.  The flavor is perfect.  The eggplant was nice and cheesy, fresh and hot.  The pasta was cooked well.  I am a big fan of the meatballs, they were delish!  The salad and the bread weren't bad.  The bread was a little dry.      Overall a good experience and I liked the food a lot.",

The menu is pretty extensive, most of your common dishes with some surprises.   I started with an order of calamari. They were good. No complaints, but the marinara sauce that comes with it was delicious. It's so good you'll want a bowl of it by itself. They also bring out rolls to start the meal. I wish they would have been warm or another type of bread better for dipping.    For dinner I ordered the chicken parm. It was classic. The chicken was nice a crispy and then topped with sauce an cheese. I also added a side of meatballs - the order comes with three and these were definitely the star of the evening. They packed so much flavor! And they tasted even better on the second day. #winning  Overall, this is a pretty solid place. I look forward to coming back, there were a few dishes that I saw come out the kitchen that I can't wait to try!",

    "text": "Decent little Italian place in the quickly developing area by the outlets, but the atmosphere is too fast-casual for the more extensive menu.   Similar to many other strip mall Italian restaurants where you see pizza options displayed when you walk in, the minimalist decor and lack of sound absorption made this a bit louder and less comfortable than expected.   An $8 10\" vegetarian pizza was chock full of toppings and the crust had a nice crispness on the bottom, so a good value. The pasta dish we ordered was tasty and filling for $13. Bread and salad were run of the mill and unfortunately the service was a bit lacking, as we had to ask three time for our drinks (water), which were finally brought out with the food.   Nothing outstanding about this place good or bad, it just seems to blend into the background when considering the variety and quality of culinary options around the metro area. Could be good for families or groups and the small patio could be nice in the warmer months. Local beers represented on tap.",

My friend and I decided to come for lunch on a Friday. We got there around 12:20pm and the restaurant wasn't too busy. We decided to sit on the outside area that was pretty nice. I chose the gnocchi and my friend the crab dip. Gnocchi is one of my favorites kind of foods so I had  to try theirs. The gnocchi was hard and the sauce was acidity was way too much besides there was a hair in my food. The food my friend ordered she liked it and I tried and it was good too. When I was almost done with my meal the waitress came with my bread that she was supposed to bring with my gnocchi. I didn't even wasted my time complaining about the hair in my meal because wasn't worth it.  As a matter of fact nothing was worth it in this visit. This is one of the few places I will never go back to.",

Food was served fast and hot.  Hands down one of the best white sauces I've ever had.  Fettuccine was perfect as well as the chicken.  Staff was very attentive and I never had to ask for anything.  The inside is a little on the smaller side, but they also have an outside dining area as well.  The atmosphere is causal and fun.  I will definitely visit this location again the next time I'm in Charlotte and would recommend Enrico's to anyone that loves Italian food!",

The food is just always delicious, cooked or baked to perfection, always a generous portion and the service is always friendly and attentive. 10/10 highly recommend! Try the baked ziti, chicken parmigiana, pizza, calzone, or anything really. You won't regret it!!!  Also I want to add that the ambiance and decor is PERFECT. We absolutely appreciate not having the cheap fake vines or grapes or whatever else crap decor you find in an olive garden type place. Enricos is the real deal.",

    "text": "Meh... I'd stop and grab a pizza, they looked pretty good. The menu was pretty big, staff friendly. Stopped in because it's close to home and we got frustrated that we couldn't find parking where we wanted to eat in Southend... we should have kept trying. The inside of Enrico's is very stark, someone has had some overly bright pics of Italy put on canvas at Office Depot and hung them awkwardly - that's the extent of the 'decor'. I realize it's just a simple place, but a few nice pieces of art and live plants would help. And it desperately needs some fabric/textiles - on a window, floor, something - the acoustics are horrible. Hard to hear your dining partner as all conversation around you is bouncing off cement walls and floor. Bathroom needs help in every way - sink too low, looks 20 years old, faucet didn't work correctly, towel dispenser didn't work.  Salad was very good - comes with plastic take out container of dressing, sister shubert rolls come with little butter things like at a diner (only after we asked). Yet they charge what a high end place would for their entrees. They are overpriced for the type of place/atmosphere/food. Fra Diavolo is one of my favorite Italian dishes - I almost always order it when I see it on the menu. Let's start with the positives: the shrimp were delicious and cooked right. The linguine was al dente. However, the mussels were so tiny they were almost nonexistent; not worth the trouble to get a toddler's thumbnail size piece of meat. Evenso, all would have been fine but someone was so heavy handed with the red pepper flakes, I had to constantly drink water and sniff (I wanted to drink my wine and would have ordered more), and no other flavors of the dish came through at all because the red pepper was so overpowering. It was hard to eat and was very oily. I would not try it again; I left most of it and ate cereal when we got home - not worth $17. My fiance had lobster ravioli, and it was pretty good, not spectacular. All in all ok little place, I would def stop in for a pizza but if I got pasta again I think I'd keep it simple. I'd love to see them up their game to match their menu prices - I hate all the chain junk Berewick has installed; we need nice little spots on this side of town!",

The pizza was edible - filling and pretty standard.  It's an option if you are just looking for something filling and relatively inexpensive (pastas are around $10-14).",

My partner had a Caesar salad and Alfredo with grilled chicken.   Sadly I wasn't that impressed again. The buffalo chicken soup was a unique concept and tasted buffalo chicken dip so it wasn't bad. My partner said the caesar salad was great. However, the main dishes just lacked something.   The food is just bland to me. My lasagna was a great portion but it just wasn't amazing. I tasted my partners Alfredo sauce and it needed some salt or some pepper or something. It tasted like it was store bought.   I don't taste any love or authenticity in this food which I want to with it being in such a convenient location. I won't be back and wish I tasted what everyone else was in these reviews!",

The salmon caesar salad (w/o the olives) was the best salad I've had in a long time and I usually dislike going anywhere and paying over $5 for a bowl of lettuce. I also had some type of penne pasta with chicken and broccoli in it (chicken was added) and it was also to die for!

Our server did say it was amazing. Although the flavor wasn't bad, it was super watery and there was hardly anything in it. I didn't see any chicken or anything else in it. Just watery broth.   My friend got the caprese salad and she loved it. I got the lasagna as our meal and my friend got the pasta fagioli soup as her entree. Strange thing was we told the server that she wanted the soup as her entree but the brought the soup out before my lasagna. When my friend asked if they can take it back and wait when they brought out the lasagna, she said the back staff was going to give her a hard to for doing that and that once it's ready, they want it out of the kitchen. Strange. My lasagna was good, very cheesy and it had a lot of sauce. It came with rolls. Nothing special but just served with butter. I was going to get the spaghetti and meatballs as my entree but I asked if the meatballs were homemade (I hate frozen meatballs), she said they were NOT homemade. I was soooo surprised she said that but appreciated her honesty.   Overall, the experience was nice and pleasant.",

Nothing super unique screams out and borders on chain Italian restaurant standards but definitely hit the spot!",

Fetechini Alfredo- light sauce no x cheese on top & side of mozzarella cheese - Incredible! Really good. Huge portions! Enough to have again for dinner.   For lunch, My friend got... Calamari- She loved it! 10 it off 10.   Spaghetti with sauce- She liked it so much she ate it again for left over dinner and she hardly ever eats leftovers. She did say the sauce was a tad sweet.",

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the place smelled like someone's old Italian grandmother was in the kitchen! The aroma was absolutely breathtaking and I couldn't wait to try the food!  The menu is massive! Pizza, pastas, sandwiches, salads... Basically everything you'd expect to see at an Italian restaurant. There were a lot of things that I want to try so I can't wait to go back. I got the chicken cacciatore and my wife got the eggplant parmasen. Both were delicious. The pasta was amazing and seemed hand made. The vegetables and white wine sauce were perfect. I can't wait to go back!   Pros: - Food is extremely authentic - Side salads are HUGE - Entrees are HUGE and after the side salad I couldn't even come close to finishing. Good for at least 2 meals.  - Their DELICIOUS bread is unlimited - You can choose your pasta type with the pasta dishes - Pasta was al dente... Cooked to perfection.   Cons: - A bit small. Three large parties came in and that was it - No cocktail menu (I'm not that creative with my liquor and I need help lol",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch today and was seated back I the corner next to a wine fridge. The layout of the place is odd. It's like it's a pop up restaurant and they just scattered tables around the room. It needs a wall or something separating the dining area. There are a few pictures of Italy but the environment seems quite sterile compared to most Italian places I've been in.  There's full bar in the back as well and a counter where I assume can get take out orders.  The menu is broad and includes Italian specialties, pizza and sandwiches. I was craving a cheesesteak and went with that and added marinara sauce to o it.  When it came out, the sandwich looked promising. The roll was soft and may have been homemade. The meat was cut up well and provolone was melted on top of the meat. Onions on the bottom and marinara on top of the cheese.   The onions could have been cooked longer as they were still raw. I prefer my onions to be carmelized and these were slightly steamed. The meat was lacking something...maybe salt and pepper. Sauce was good but there needed to be more cheese. It was an Ok sandwich but not close to anything you find near Philly.   I'd like to come back and try some of their other options but the sterile environment may keep me away. I think there are better, more comfortable places around Charlotte.",

I would def recommend their chicken parm & cheesy bread. The cheesy bread is so good and warm. The chicken that is served with the parm is big and juicy. I'm glad I opted for this. I wanna try the BBQ chicken pizza next time. Oh! It's also enough for two people. I couldn't finish it.   My bf opted for the chicken Alfredo but that...needs some salt & love. It just wasn't seasoned enough. The chicken tasted boiled. Black pepper and salt will save it though. I wouldn't order it personally.   All in all, I will order from Enrico's again.",

My waiter today was Jesus, he was amazing and very helpful when recommending something to try. In regards to the soup of the day I went with his recommendation for the creamy chicken soup with garlic. The soup was amazing, very flavorful in a nice creamy sauce. As far as the entree, I went with alfredo with chicken. With the entree comes a salad fyi. In regards to the alfredo, initially it came out a bit too soupy for me, but I requested that the sauce be made thicker and when it came back out it was 100% better. They have such a large menu, I will definitely  be back to try other options, I know there is something I will fall in love with. The menu includes, pasta, pizza, calzones, plenty of appetizer choices as well as dessert. There is also a kids menu. They will also have some type of bar, not sure if they have a liquor license but they were stocking bottles of wine while I was there today.",

Our order of large Calzone and two salads was taken. The salads arrived in a few minutes and it was a plate full. All fresh. The Calzone arrived as big as a large pizza! 1/2 went home as lunch for tomorrow.  The sauce and cheese had great flavor. I did not have room for desert. They have a bar and craft beers. So under 35$ and we got 4 meal. Great food and service.",

The portions were enough to share and the pricing was affordable- especially when you can share! Great family and or date night with indoor and outdoor seating. We will drive back from Belmont to enjoy this Italian delight!",

The menu pictured on yelp describes that dish as \"sauteed fresh tomatoes with garlic with our fresh melted mozzarella.\" What I got was a pureed tomato sauce over penne and bland chicken that tasted like it was pre-made hours ago. I wouldn't mind paying 10 bucks for a meal like this in a mall food court or family diner, but to be charged $17 for this and store bought bread is a rip-off. Maybe they focus all their energy on their pizzas.....",

Having just moved out near the lake, there were a number of times when a quick pizza, veal parm, chicken piccata, or the stromboli sounded like a good dinner option.  The food has always been good. Decent portions at the right price. The bread and pizza dough is delicious. The red sauce cane be a little thin, more so just with the pasta. The fettuccini Alfredo is also good, but a little light on the sauce. Regardless, it's my go to for a quick take out dinner and occasionally a quick sit down dinner.  The decor is modern minimalist (lots of grays, lots of wood, lots of gray wood).  The bar area is small but they have excellent bartenders and are well stocked. A small but solid wine and beer list.  This will continue to be a regular pick for midweek take out!",
