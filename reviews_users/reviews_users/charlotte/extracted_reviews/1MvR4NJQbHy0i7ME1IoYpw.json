Personable staff, amazing food, smart-casual attire, -it just oozes comfort and quality.  My wife and I recently celebrated our anniversary here and had the following:  Cocktails to start: -Old Fashioned (made good and strong) -Jack and Coke (also made good and strong)  Appetizers: Shrip Cocktail (We wish we had ordered more!) Frog Legs (These were good sized and good) Escargot (delicious)  Entres: NY Strip with shredded King Crab on top (Huge cut and super tasty) Filet Mignon with crab cake (equally as tasty)  We also shared: Sauteed mushrooms (Order these!!) Creamed Spinach (so rich and creamy) A bottle of Pinot Grigio (crisp and perfect)  In the end we were incredibly stuffed and brought a bunch of food home.  Ahhh... delicious, delicious leftovers!  We cannot wait to go back!",

I know it's supposed to be 'a hole in the wall' local steak house, but we were seated on the back 'patio'... which resembled a sports bar more than a steak house... really loud and disappointing place to be seated since we were celebrating my father's birthday.   Service was just okay... not bad, but she was not very attentive.   Like I said, the steak was excellent (and the only thing saving this review)... The salad was as plain as they come and poorly prepared. (The house made dressings were pretty good though).   The sides were terrible... I mean pretty much inedible. My dad added a king crab leg, and it was half terribly cooked... way over done.   The icing on the cake... our waitress hand wrote \"20% gratuity = $X\" and added it all up on the check A.) I can do math, B.) I always tip 20%, but I don't need to you suggest your tip C.) That's just tacky for supposedly high end restaurant... it's not Olive Garden.   Overall a huge let down... especially considering it was just over $300 for 5 people. (not bad for a steakhouse, but bad for what we got)",

    "text": "So I will acknowledge that I'm in the minority here. It's been around since 1958 so what do I know? That said, we won't be going back. First, the positives: easy parking, seated immediately (although the reservation was for 5pm and the place was mostly empty) and greeted pleasantly by the bus boy and waiter. Our steaks (mine a filet, the wife's a Delmonico) were excellent and the baked potato perfectly baked.  Then the negatives: * both my wife and I noticed a distinctive unpleasant taste to the water poured from a pitcher by the bus boy - sort of like it came out of a hose. We asked for a replacement which was much better but that was an off-putting way to start the evening.  * our waiter never made it clear that my onion soup appetizer could have taken the place of the included salad for a small up charge. * then there's the supposed \"classic salad.\" Really? Iceberg lettuce accompanied by a plate of large cut vegetables (onions, green pepper, radish, cucumber, and cherry tomatoes) that you have to assemble yourself. Tremendously wasteful in my opinion since neither of us are fans of green pepper and I hate cucumbers. Where's grated cheese, croutons, carrots, etc? The dressings were OK but nothing spectacular. It's only a \"classic salad\" cause they call it one.  * No bread was offered - only crackers already at the table. I've since read reviews raving about their bread but we wouldn't know since we never got any.  * a different server delivered our main courses after which no one, including our original waiter, checked back to see if the meals were to our liking. Heck, that's a basic \"waiter 101\" which happens at virtually every other place I've eaten at. Very disappointing not to have it happen at a high dollar restaurant.",

The bread everyone said was amazing, was just toasted bread. How about some garlic?  I ordered the shrimp cocktail. I love spice but man I thought my head would explode.  As spicy as the cocktail sauce was, you would think they would spice up their other food. Nope. The steaks were bland and the mashed potatoes just as bland. I was excited to get an onion ring. Looked good but way to bready.  My husband had to ask for 57 sauce for his steak and a couple we ate with put ketchup on her steak. I think maybe the people who like this place haven't had a really good steak.  Maybe they just have been going here for 30+ years they haven't tried anything else.  I promise there is better out there. I didn't mind it was a dive. Amazed it's been open this long.",

Its got so much charm and the staff is so very nice.  In these days of the cookie cutter chains, its nice to set something unique, something that has nostalgia. When traveling, I always ask the locals where to go, and they said here. Later on, at a different place , I sparked up a conversation with some more locals and their eyes lit up when I told them we went to the Beef & Bottle.  You aren't going to get a cranberry walnut arugula and microgreens salad with a port wine reduction dressing here or a fine selection of cheeses with artisan bread baked today, but you will get some wholesome standard fare that's prepared well.  The seafood player was good size and the crab cakes were excellent. Lots of crab meat and little stuffing.  I'd go back again.",

We shared the ribeye which was nicely cooked and the salmon was not overdone as well.  I liked the fact that the entrees came with the sides, as opposed to having to order sides for $7-8 more each.  Definitely a good value for a steakhouse.  The atmosphere was dimly lit booths with decent service, nothing special, which probably differentiates them with the more expensive steakhouses.  I would come back for good steak that won't break the bank for a special occasion with the significant other.",

    "text": "I debated on the 5th star, but you know what?  The Manager asked me if there I was anything he should change and I told him \"Please don't change a thing, you can only mess it up\".    Concerning the commentary about how it looks from the outside:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Yeah, it has some \"Mafia hideout place to bring your mistress maybe it's really a strip club\" look to it - but if you haven't figured it out by now, that IS part of the charm and the appeal.  One reviewer here thinks none of the clientele are locals.  Perhaps he is clairvoyant, but I don't think it is possible to make such a claim.  Pricey?  Not really.  Making comparisons to Outback?  You should probably stick with Outback.  To start - our waitress (also the bartender) Hillary made me one of the better Old Fashioneds with Dark Rum I've had.  She left out the orange but it was still pretty great.  Now she knows she has Myers on hand, too.   We had \"the cheese\" but with Panini bread instead of crackers.  Sounds silly, I know.  I thought the cheese was to die for, and the danger here is eating too much of it.  Next time I will eat the cheese with a spoon when no one is looking.  The bread is crazy good, too.  There is a reason they bring this out to your table when you are seated - it's tastes really good.  We also had French Onion Soup, Salad with Blue Cheese, Shrimp Scampi (prepared perfectly), Trout (perfect), Ribeye (it was hard to resist licking my plate in public when it was gone), Creamed Spinach (awesome) and Mushrooms.  (I love mushrooms, but these are prepared in a wine sauce, wheras I am more of a garlic butter fan).  We had a hard time choosing a bottle of wine, but we described what we were looking for and another waiter made a recommendation - it was spot on.  I think it may be crowded on Mon and Thurs for half-priced wine nights, so remember you probably need a reservation any night of the week.  When we were leaving a van full of seniors showed up with no reservations.  The Manager was trying to accommodate, and I hope they were able to work it out but...trust me, make a reservation.  We had to skip the dessert this time, but it was tempting.  We thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, and sincerely hope it doesn't change a bit.  We are new fans and cannot wait to go back.  To anyone who didn't like it, you should probably stick with chain restaurants.",

    "text": "We arrived at the Beef and Bottle at 6:25 pm for a 6:30 pm reservation on the December 21st.   There was a lady from behind the register that snorted 'Name?' while she was busy attending to another customer wanting gift certificates.   Nothing more was said.  We waited.  About five minutes later, the lady handed four menus to an elderly gentleman sitting near the counter and gave him a table number.  We found out later that the elderly gentleman was in fact a co-owner.  The elderly gentleman sat us down, looked as his watch and said 'Enjoy the meal.  This table is booked at 8:00 pm. [pause to look at his watch], You should have enough time.'  We all looked at each other in surprise.   First allow me to mention that we booked the table on OpenTable and there is no mention of a time limit.  Second, we are in Charlotte, NC - not some hot restaurant in NYC.  Suffice it to say, for the rest of the meal, we felt like we were running against the clock.  By the time the main meal service was done it was 7:45 pm.  We were asked if we wanted dessert and we declined as our table time was soon to be up.  Around that time the elderly gentleman, who is a co-owner, came back and asked how things were.  We stated our frustration with the 'time limit' and he just shrugged his shoulders, said that 'this was the only way they had figured out how to do things' and then... he walked off!  We did not even have time to tell him about the disappointing food...            Concerned about the time allotment, we skipped appetizers and just went for the mains with their sides.  Three of us ordered the filet and lobster tail combo.    One of us ordered just the filet.  Each entree came with two sides.  For those of us with the lobster tail, they arrived overcooked and barley warm (they were probably sitting under a heat lamp).  The clarified butter was starting to congeal.  My steak was actually fine and medium rare as I had ordered.  However, two of us had ordered the fillets as medium well, yet they clearly arrived as medium rare.  Each of the steaks is served with an onion ring on top.  In each case, the onion rings were cold and basically inedible.   Sides were fine, but baked potatoes and iceberg lettuce salads are hard to mess up.   All of that for 4 people came to $350 with one $60 bottle of wine.             Our server that night was fine.  However, the food issues coupled with the co-owner, his comments and his attitude were all a real let down.   Some will say that Beef and Bottle is 'old school' or 'an institution'.   Don't get sucked in.  At best this place is below average and is clearly in decay.",

When I arrived, the table was set up for us, but it took at least fifteen minutes for the server to greet us. They had half priced wine (hell yeah), but the wine list was not even on the table. The crackers and cheese whiz thing just made me feel insulted. When paying $30 a plate, one shouldn't have to unwrap captain's wafers while waiting for beverages. If they pride themselves on being a local landmark, couldn't they buy a few loaves of bread from Nova's or Suarez?  The oysters Rockefeller were overcooked. They looked like they had sat in the window for twenty minutes (and quite possibly could have). My filet had to be sent back, but did eventually taste great. The salad consisted of iceberg, radishes, (not so fresh) tomatoes, green peppers. Served on warm salad plates. The salad dressing, however,  was pretty good.  A manager/ owner was present, but never stopped by our table. This place is too f*%#$@* small to not have a manager/owner check on the guest satisfaction at tables, especially if a steak had to be recooked.    As we left, the manager/owner turned the inside lights off before we got to the door. Rude . Had the service and food prep been quicker, we would have already been out the door an hour prior to that. I do not recommend this restaurant.",

Oysters Rockefeller were good but sauteed mushrooms were awful.  We won't be back.",

    "text": "OK so I was secretly really excited to go here with what I had been told by a lot of my clients. But alas I have experienced better.  My fiancee and I purchased a deal here through living social and we were both confused and excited to go here. We were told the steaks were to die for and the atmosphere was something to be seen.  It looks bad on the outside and to be 100% honest with you the 5 years I have lived in my house and driven by here I thought it was a biker bar. So I was surprised when I looked up the website and saw the prices of the meals but that aside I was very curious. My Mom had also bought the deal and we were all going to go together.  My fiancee called and the restaurant said if we all wanted to sit together we had to have at least 5 people with us, so we invited my friend as we made reservations at 7. Jerry and I arrived at 6:55 and we went in the back door not knowing it was the back door, but a very nice waitress grabbed us and usher us up front we were sat at a table for 10 even though we only had 5 which was a little odd but oh well. We got water right away but that was it. The rest of our party got there at about 7:05 so  not to bad but still only water.... When the waitress did come she very quickly took our drink order but did not wait 5 min to see if we wanted appetizers. She brought the drinks back and our Brandy Old Fashions were in extremely small glasses, trust me when I say EXTREMELY SMALL.  Still they were quite perfect which is really hard to find.  Again she quickly took our orders and almost seemed annoyed to answer any questions. Salads took about 25-30 min which is funny because you build your own. The ranch dressing though amazing!!  No one took our salads plates away nor did I ever get a chance to order another drink and we had to literally grab the waitress when we need more water at least.  About 35-40 min after the salad we finally get our steak. Now we all ordered rare or med rare so we were surprised that it took so long. The steak I had was very very good I will not down play that the flavor was incredible but my mom's was wrong and over cooked THREE times! Finding the waitress was like finding a needle in a haystack.  Over all great atmosphere, I loved the decor and music it is totally a rat pack hide away. Food was pretty good but really expensive for what you get and service was fair if not bad. They treated us well they comped my moms steak and let her use her living social thing. But the service was so sub-par for the amount we were paying that it really bothered Jerry so I do not think we will be going back .",

Last night we got the frog legs, which I was told were much bigger and meatier than most...There was half a bite worth of meat on each. I feel like this place is hurting from word of mouth OVERselling it. It's like when someone tells you they saw the best movie ever and inevitably the overhyping takes away from something just being good. This is an iconic restaurant from the history it's shared with Charlotte and offers good food. Period.",

WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG????  I have been to all the fancy steak houses in Charlotte...they are great, but for my money, I will come back to Beef and Bottle every time.  I had the filet and lobster tail combo; for $45 I got a salad, a side item, a 6 oz filet that was expertly prepared and a LARGE lobster tail....you just can't get that quantity of food or quality for $45 anywhere else in CLT.  I also loved the atmosphere; so laid back...it was refreshing.  Folks aren't there to been seen (like at Del Friscos); just there for some great steak/seafood.  Also, on Sunday and Thursday night, wine is 1/2 price by the glass or bottle.  I had a glass of excellent Argentinan Malbec for $3.75 and it was the largest pour I have ever received in a restaurant.  My husband and I each had drinks, steak, lobster tail, salad and sides...and the bill totaled $110.  You won't find that anywhere else  Run, don't walk to Beef and Bottle.",

    "text": "I've read the reviews below and feel comfortable giving a 4.75-star review to Beef & Bottle.  Here's why:  I called Rick on Tuesday night at 5:40PM and requested a table for two at 6:00PM.  No, I didn't NEED a reservation but upon arriving, Rick greeted me with a handshake and a personal greeting, used my name, and sat me at my \"reserved table,\" as if I were a regular.  I'm not actually on a first name basis with Rick, and I'm not a regular, though I do go there once every three months or so.  All of this personal attention isn't unique to me, it's just the way Beef & Bottle does business and it is one of the ways that they separate themselves from all other steakhouses in Charlotte.  We were greeted instantaneously by our server, whom was quick to suggest a bottle of wine.  Her mid-priced suggestion was appreciated; I quickly lose respect for a restaurant whose staff automatically suggests the most expensive item on the menu. The wine was exactly as promised.   The French Onion soup was perfectly hot, and served quickly with just enough cheese... 4 stars.  My guest was pleasantly surprised by the salad (each person receives a plate of lettuce, and the table receives trays of fresh vegetables to share).  We both ordered NY Strips medium-rare and they were cooked perfectly.  I can say the same for the ribeye and the filets as well. Well seasoned and accompanied with your choice of potato, sweet potato, fries, etc.  I've never eaten dessert here, as I'm always far too full, but they do look delicious.  The 1950s decor (dimly lit, wood paneling) really does add to the atmosphere.  If you've ever seen Goodfellas, you'll think that it's the perfect place to talk about getting somebody \"Whacked.\"   A great place for a date or a business deal or both.  The staff is responsive, warm and welcoming, the drinks are above average, and the steaks are some of the best in town.  My guest, a buddy in from New York, noted repeatedly that B&B is exactly the type of place that a single guy needs to become a regular at for the benefit of his dating life.",

    "text": "This was a recommendation from the front desk person at the Marriott.  Normally I shy away from recommended restaurants by hotels, but I thought I would check it out given the strength of the recommendation.   It doesn't look like much from the road, you need to drive around back and park and then you walk through a well-lit area with some sort of air hearing/cooling device that is installed close to where the seats are. This must be the overflow seating or a special events area.   You walk though this area and then down a step into the darkness. It's really dark. A hostess cheerfully greets you and directs you to a candle-lit table with red lights in the ceiling. It takes your eyes a while to adjust to the darkness. It must be the darkest restaurant I've ever been in with the exception of the Buddha Bar in Paris. That's so dark that you have to hold the menu to the candle to see what's available.   After a while I got used to the lack of light and had a great waiter walk me through the menu. The food is not really fancy, but it's very tasty. Their emphasis is on steaks and seafood. I had the shrimp scampi with a salad (huge). For dessert try the apple pie with the melted caramel.   The server was very professional and engaging. It seems like most folks here know each other, it must be a community icon having been around for 50+ years.   All in all a positive experience, definitely a throw-back to the past glories of steakhouses. I left a good sized tip and plan to return to Beef & Bottle for another round the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Sure do like this  place.  It does not look like much from the outside other than maybe a one-time restaurant popular in a long past era.  BUT...it is still a popular steak house from the 1950s that has that formal aura that you might have experienced at times eating out with your parents.  At least it was with mine.  When you sit down you are served a relish tray and a nice pimento cheese spread with crackers.  THAT is really old time that I remember was common in the 1950s, dying out through the 1960s.  Always thought the relish tray was a class act.  We are stuck in a beef rut always ordering the filet.  The meat is prime quality, at least it looks, tastes and cuts that way and is a treat.  Served with a loaded (or not) baked potato and a couple of fried onion rings you have a wonderful meal.  Dimly lighted, large menu, linen topped tables and attentive and personable wait staff that have been working there for years.  Certainly a special event kind of restaurant and they do have a separate area for larger parties.  Their menu has a lot of other choices, so maybe I will get brave and venture out from the filet...but maybe not?  Their fresh made apple pie is split-able/shareable as you will be full after your meal.  Get it with ice cream...why not?  Wine bottles and glasses of wine are half-price on Mondays and Thursdays.  Why those days is beyond me other than if you do dine here during the week you might get in without a reservation.  But don't count on it, so please reserve ahead.  Weekends are really a mob scene, but regardless of crowds, the service and food quality does not falter.    Great place.",

    "text": "If you don't like steak and you are forced into a steak dinner for your boyfriends 30th birthday, go to Beef N Bottle!!! Everything from the ambience to the staff to the food was awesome!   The inside of the restaurant is so cute. The minute you walk in you feel like you're transported back to the 60s. There are a ton of old pictures up of stars from then and the decor matches t perfectly. It was a very classic feel.   We started at the bar for a few drinks. The bar area isn't super big but big enough to feel intimate with some space if that makes sense. They have some high too seating and some normal tables as well. Seems like an area for a larger party.   We then went into the dining room for dinner. Again, such a beautiful setup. We sat in a huge, high seat booth. Very comfy! Our waitress was very prompt and very friendly especially for how busy she seemed! Definitely make a reservation, this place is busy no matter the time or day!   We started with the crab dip and French onion soup, both amazing. The dip was just the right amount and not too heavy that it filled us up. The French onion soup was the best I've ever had! The cheese was perfect. I ordered the Delmonico with a salad and cheesy fried potatoes and my boyfriend ordered the NY Strip with broccoli and spinach (I think-can't remember!). My salad was so good, weird for just a salad but the way it's presented is great. You get a plain plate of greens and then all the add-ons on the side, so you make your own. And the blue cheese is to die for!!! A must!   My Delmonico was perfect. Cooked to perfection, seasoned perfectly, and tasted great! If I wasn't so full, I probably would have eaten the whole thing!  Cheesy fried potatoes  My boyfriend didn't like the NY strip, he said it was very chewy and not too tasty. So they took it back and gave home a Delmonico instead at no extra charge. Very accommodating! So in the end, we are both pleased. They brought out a birthday Sunday which was also delicious!   I'm already planning my next visit and I can't wait!!",

Oysters Rockefeller was very good, and the onion rings were outstanding. But when my medium rare delmonico arrived, it was a medium well New York strip instead. Those things are a lot drier and chewier than what I ordered, but since it took over an hour and a half to get the steak, I didn't say anything after the first few bites. After less than half the steak was eaten, I gave up, I just flat didn't like it, it wasn't what I ordered. By then the wait staff was quite scarce. When she finally reappeared to start taking plates, I tried to mention it and she made it quite clear she wasn't concerned at all. I decided not to be an ass in front of everyone, even if it WAS a 34 dollar steak that was substituted for a tougher drier cut and then cooked too long.  On the other hand, they did store a cake we brought (birthday thing for me)  and keep it safe until we wanted it, and they added candles to it when they brought it out for us at the end of the meal. So all in all I liked everything about my birthday dinner legendary steakhouse except the steak. Unfortunately I cannot recommend it to any one any more if they are going to be doing this now.",

    "text": "I made a reservation 4 weeks in advance of our dinner Saturday night at 7pm. The night of our reservation I called to confirm the time and was told they needed the table back by 8:30. Ok? Weird.  We were running a few minutes late for our reservation time so we called to let them know and were told again, they needed the table back at 830. Yes, we understand. We arrived at 7:10.  Once again when we checked in at the restaurant the rude hostess practically shouted at us they need the table back by 8:30.  We almost walked out. The only reason we stayed is we were with a friend for his birthday and he had a gift certificate to use.  I understand it is a small restaurant, but they should know better than to so rudely rush their patrons. The server, John, was excellent and gave us no indication that we needed to hurry. In fact he took long time to take our orders. If you need us to leave at a specific time you might want to communicate that to your staff and not stress your patrons into checking their phones every 10 minutes for the time. John did not rush us through our meal nor did he move with any kind of fire when we asked for the check and waited for our receipts. We left at 8:45. I've never been told what time I needed to leave a restaurant. I will not be back.",

Definitely recommend requesting to sit inside opposed to the patio when making your reservation as it has so much more character.  Dinner here for two will be $100 plus if you have cocktails, appetizer, and your steak. However, its definitely in line with other top steakhouses and you get what you pay for. We've had the shrimp cocktail (soo good and the sauce will open your sunus'), oysters rockerfeller, and cajun crab dip as appetizer and all ahve been really good. The first time I had the filet and scallops combo and my husband had the filet and fried oysters combo. The last time I had the 6oz filet and my husband had the ribeye special. We both decided to skip the salad and get 2 sides each. We're tried the creamed spinach. fried cheesy potato, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. Again, all have been wonderful. Our server ech time was great and fun! You can bring your own wine and pay the corkerage fee which I did the first time, but did not most recently as I knew I wanted a martini and wine by the glass. When we want a great steak, this is where we go now.",

But to me it lost some of intimate feel when it expanded.  There has been a loyal customer base that that came weekly and sat at the same table each time. I am sure this older generation is disappearing and don't know if customers will try it without a past link to going there.  But I recommend giving this restaurant a chance & experience the atmosphere of being at a classic steakhouse that has the feel that Sinatra & gang would have hung out here. There is tons of Charlotte history here.",

While it must be doing well enough to stay open for so long, the culinary scene in Charlotte has evolved immensely over the last several years. The market this type of place appeals to - the market that likes a good (not great) meat and two - is dwindling because there are so many other options and at the same or lower price point for the same/better caliber of food.   I had the filet mignon - good but not great. Ambiance so outdated that it doesn't even have classic charm - it's just dark and loud. Service is fine but not great.   Bottom line - it's cool if you feel like you have to see a Charlotte staple but honestly just go somewhere else. For all the culinary gems this city has to offer you'll be better off.",

We tend to eat out at the newer trendy places but skipped that idea, and so glad we did. Loved the old traditional atmosphere and coziness. Loved sitting with portraits of Clark Gable and Tom Jones over our shoulders and Clint Eastwood across the room! Also, was really nice to hear Billy Holliday singing softly overhead. Our waiter Edwin was perfectly attentive without being overbearing, and even served us a pre-meal bottle of champagne since it was an anniversary reservation we called in.The wife's filet mignon medallions were cooked to perfection, and my filet mignon and salmon in bourbon sauce was supreme! Nice cold beer from the tap and the wife's merlot was outstanding. Get back to the classics, my young friends, and fellow yelpers! You won't regret it!",

When my food came out it was cold on inside told waiter about it my food didn't come back until my party was almost done .

    "text": "Came here for a co workers birthday dinner at the recommendation of some Charlotte locals. Was not disappointed and thoroughly enjoyed a good steak dinner!   Atmosphere: the restaurant is tucked away off a decently busy road out of the Uptown area. From the outside looks like a modest, brown house from the 50's. Upon entering it feels immediately as though you have taken a step back in time to an old school clubhouse. Dark, wood paneled walls, contrasted with stark white table clothes and black and white pictures of icons from past decades adorn the walls. Almost feels like an old New York Italian restaurant. I felt like we should have been wearing bowler hats and puffing on cigars.   Food:  Appetizer: I ordered a cup of clam chowder which was thick and creamy and stock full of potatoes, clams, and some carrots. Only note -- it should have been a bit hotter as it was lukewarm when it was placed in front of me. Tasted homemade.  I didn't order a salad but some others at the table did. All the dressings are made in house with the exception of one (don't remember which) but only heard positive things around the table. Was interesting that additional vegetables for the salad were served on a side platter for everyone to share so you could pick and choose whether you wanted bell peppers or radishes or red onions etc...   Entree: I ordered the filet mignon (6 oz) medium rare with two sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus. I hadn't had steak in a while so this really hit the spot. Perfect medium rare pink inside, very tender and very high quality cut of meat. Each bite was velvety and the steak was well seasoned, letting the flavor of the beef come through well. Nice griddle marks on the outside as well. The onion ring that came with it could have been left off. It didn't taste quite fresh (could have been from the oil) and was very under seasoned. I understand they wanted to include a crunchy garnish but I think it would have been more effective with maybe onion straws or just reworking the batter/ seasoning for the onion ring.  Asparagus was good, nothing spectacular but also not bad. Mashed potatoes had subtle hints of garlic and a was kept slightly chunky which I really enjoyed. Not overly garliced and also not overly salted. A nice creamy complement to the snap of the asparagus and the star that was the filet.   Colleague ordered the surf and turf pictured and I think was silent throughout the whole meal, completely enraptured by the food-- so I assume it was good?   Overall: cool atmosphere, good quality food and a nice and authentic nod to a past time without being over the top or gaudy.",

The waitress said they are known for their blue cheese dressing. I didn't think it was that great. I have had better.  I got the 6 oz fillet and my husband got Fettucini Alfredo. My steak was amazing. Cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. My husband loved his fettucini and it was a very generous portion.   This place is expensive. The food is ok.

Knowing that you can get some fantastic food in some divvy places, we were willing to look past the environment.   The hostess walked us to our two-top, bar-height table where she handed both menus to my husband and walked away. Ok??? I'm in a dress and bar-height was not my idea of the perfect table for our celebration. Additionally, there were way too items on the table to function. Two placemats (dinner napkins folded into triangles), two small plates, crackers, cheese, dinnerware, water glasses, and our drinks.... I started to get concerned where the food would sit.    Next comes the waiter. Proceeds to tell me that I shouldn't order fish in a steak place. Oh how I wish I'd listened to him. It was disgusting. My husband's steak was an overlooked cheap cut of meat, so I'm not sure that was a good choice either.   I could go on, but suffice it to say we will NEVER go back. This may have been the place to go back in the day, but its course has run and you should too.",

Few things were missing, I never received my appetizer and she never asked me if I like a desert. No big deal, but if you recommend a dish, you should make sure I receive my order. The kicker and the main reason I will never step foot into the establishment, while waiting outside for my driver by the front door, a young man in a moron shirt with the restaurant logo starts digging through the ash tray outside, being from a large Metropolitan city I see this all the time by homeless people. After he digging a few bits out, he walks over to another gentleman and asked for a light, takes a few puffs than heads back into the restaurant. Are you kidding me !!!",

It's an old school steakhouse (or at least what I would expect an old school steakhouse to be like as I am not quite that old). Don't let the exterior or the interior scare you off. The food is fantastic!  We started with a shrimp cocktail--the cocktail sauce has a TON of horseradish, the server warned us. Shrimp were large and good. Followed by a salad-they served each of us with a plate of lettuce and then serve the table a plate of various veggies so you can make your own salad. Pretty cool, light and refreshing. They claim to make the dressings in house. Basic offerings for the dressing---ranch, italian, 1000 island, etc. I ordered the NY strip while the others at my table ordered the filet and a NY strip. My steak was cooked as ordered and served with a loaded baked potato. The others at the table were pleased with what they ordered. Dessert was the only thing lacking. Definitely not made in house and not very good. I had the cheesecake with blueberry topping. Definitely a place to check out if you haven't been!",

    "text": "Under NO CIRCUMSTANCE will I EVER eat at Beef 'N Bottle again!!!  First, because I was alone, I was seated in a small room off the main dining room, and when I asked the hostess to re-seat me, she said that if I wanted the main dining room, I would have to specify that when making my reservation!!  She refused to seat me at a table that was indeed available, and said that the table I requested had been reserved weeks in advance!  I doubt that.  Then, my waiter finally came, and after taking my drink order, I saw him only once again the ENTIRE evening.  When I wanted a second glass of wine during dinner, I had to ask another wait person.  My meal was less than enjoyable, and I can't imagine why anyone would recommend this place.  Never again!!  I had dined at the Capital Grille the night before, and I wish I had chosen to dine there again rather than waste my evening......and my money......at Beef 'N Bottle!!",

The complimentary cheddar cheese accompanied by cheap crackers was exceptional ! Between the cup and bowl of onion soup we were served, we actually counted  SEVEN pieces if DICED onions ! A nondescript cheese floating on salad croutons and broth completed the dish. My companion pronounced the filet as the best she had  ever had. My choice of the Delmonico fell short of my expectations but it was served rare as requested and I was willing to give the place a second chance. As the waiter remove the plates, he noticed a pile of gristle and a piece of uneaten meat. He said he would talk to the manager as that was below their standards. Now I as impressed ! The manager came by, announced that Delmonico was actually a small ribeye (Hey Rube !) and that gristle was to be expected, turned tail and walked away. An obvious graduate of restaurant management school !. So ended my plans to give the place a second chance.",

Our drink order was taken and we were asked if we were ready to order and we said no, we were going to look over the appetizers first.  When our drinks arrived we ordered an appetizer.  After 17 minutes of being there 7:17, our waiter came to the table rushing us to order and spilled my wine trying to fill the water glasses while trying to ask us for our dinner order again.  We said we needed a few minutes and he said \"did you read the sign out front\".  My wife said which sign and he said the one that says you have 1 1/2 hours to eat here.  We said we knew that, we have been here several times.  We ordered on his next return, just to get out of there. We experienced the most uncomfortable and rushed dining experience ever.  We were done with the entire meal after 57 minutes, but stayed for the full 1 1/2 hours for spite.  #neverbeefandbottleagain  #worstrestaurantexperienceincharlotte",

I ordered the steak - it was crazy expensive but, I figured - it's going to be awesome for this crazy price. It was awful!!!! Full of fat and gristle, I was in shock. The wait staff didn't seem to care at all. I'm horribly disappointed and every time I pass this place - I make sure to comment to whoever is with me - \"that place is the worst\".  Just because I'm not famous or a football guy, doesn't mean I deserve bad customer service - I can't believe the staff and food were so bad - I paid through the nose and wouldn't dare set foot in this place again. I recommend avoiding it at all cost (and it will cost). Edit 09-25-15 I was talking to a co-worker about worst places to eat in Charlotte - we both came up with this place - just saying - it's not just me.",

I always get the 6oz filet medium rare.  It is salty perfection, tender and never fatty.  The sides are solid with lots to choose from - the boyfriend made me go to Texas Roadhouse recently and they put BACON in the green beens (which were from a CAN!!!) and i am still having horrific flashbacks.    Beef & Bottle always does it right - super fresh veggies, delicious homeade salad dressings.  The salads are 'make your own' which i LOVE because I can control the portions of the things on my plate and not pick through stuff I dont like.  This is an awesome way to serve salad - everyone should do this!!    We had awesome service and made it out in time to see our musical.  Love you Beef & Bottle!!!  :-D",

    "text": "When choosing a restaurant for Valentine's Day dinner we were recommended to go to beef and bottle. We were running a little bit late (13min), but at the time of making the reservation they told me it was an hour and a half table time.  When we arrived at the restaurant it was very disappointing from the outside but had already been warned about that. When we walked inside it was also still very disappointing. It was a very small place with just a bunch of pictures on the walls. Very similar to Bucca de Beppo but less of an ambience. My husband and I heard that the food was amazing so we were still going to give it a try. The hostess said that they gave our table away because we were late. Even though the sign on the door said reservations only. (which means there should've been an open table for the hour and a half.) So we were given a high top table in the bar.  Our waitress was actually the bartender. She was nice but definitely not attentive! The regular dinning table that sat behind us, had a waitress that gave them the list of specials they were offering, what was recommended, etc. (we got non of that!)  Shortly after being sat, the waitress brought a basket of prepackaged crackers  like you would receive on an airplane. No bread or anything. And a dollop of cheese spread. We ordered a bottle of wine and after she poured my glass she took the bottle back behind the bar. Each time I wanted more wine I had to flag her down to bring it back to the table. After the third time I just told her to leave it at the table. My husband and I both ordered salads and were unaware that they would bring us a plate of lettuce and we had to make our own. From the plate of vegetables they also placed on our table.  Our entrees were decent, nothing too exciting but not horrible either. We both ordered the cheesy scalloped potatoes for our sides. When they arrived mine looked pretty good but my husband's were half the size and burnt.  Our waitress did take the burnt ones back and replaced them with ones that looked a little bit better. But there was nothing cheesy about them. It just tasted like a hash brown patty.   Just as others have said, extremely overpriced!  We will NOT be returning!!!",

We were blown away by the steaks.  Perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly to our liking (Medium for me).  Outside of that I was left a little underwhelmed.  The salads where brought out as a \"build your own\" presentation.  Meaning, here's your lettuce, now here is the onions, beets, etc. to put on it.  The girlfriend loved this approach, me on the other hand don't like to work when I'm paying a certain amount.  The side dishes were preseneted in cheap cafeteria style dishes which was another turnoff.  The steak came out directly on a skillet pan which is the old school way to do it and I actually liked that.  I really wish I could get more excited about this place but unfortunately I just can't.  A couple shining stars for me regarding this place is the desert (Carrot Cake).  It was simply perfect.  Great moisture and big enough for two.  The other thing is I do actually like that fact that I don't have to dress up to get a high dollar steak, unlike Capitol Grille, Palm, etc.",

    "text": "I've waited more than 4 years to hit up Beef & Bottle...and I can't give a reason as to why it took me so long. While the exterior definitely looks a bit shady, the interior and overall experience is old school -supper club - Rat Pack - style fun.   Hubs and I serendipitously hit up B&B on a Monday evening...for half price wine night! Yes. The entire wine list, bottles and glasses are half priced on Mondays and Thursdays. And it's most definitely worth noting that the wine list is pretty fab and spans across plenty of taste profiles and price points. Jordan, Cakebread, Mirassou, Cambria, Mondavi, Stags Leap and more.   Let's talk about the meal and the overall experience:  Salad: 4/5: Comes with a steak (or entree). This is appreciated! The dressings are definitely made in house and I like the make-your-own salad option. Veggies were fresh, too.   Filet mignon, 6 oz: 4/5: My filet was cooked as I requested and I enjoyed the nice char on the outside. Mmmm hmmm.   Cocktail shrimp: 2/5: I ordered the special of the evening that came with my choice of a shrimp side. Since I was informed the cocktail sauce was nice and spicy, I went with the shrimp. Sad, small, soggy shrimp. They had no \"snap\" to them at all. The cocktail sauce, however, was pretty snappy and spicy.   Baked sweet potato: 4/5: Also came with the order. I love me a baked sweet tater. Cinnamon butter sugar on the side!   Onion rings: 5/5: Even though my order only came with one (gratis, natch) I was thiefing onion rings from hubs' plate while he was attacking his strip steak.   Ambiance: 3.5/5: I dig the old school decor, but it super, super dim in here. However, it was almost hard to see your dining partner at times. The booths, however, are large and comfortable and there's an addition added on to the back that looks similar to a covered (and I assume air conditioned) patio.   Service: 5/5: Kindly greeted and seated and our server, Nicole, was friendly and very efficient. We never went without full water and wine glasses and she made sure we always had everything we needed.   I'll definitely head back to Beef & Bottle...it was a good meal and a nice change (price and ambiance) from the other big wig steakhouses in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Yeeeeaaaaa.....about that outside. I agree with a yelper who said it looks like a 1970's rural strip joint! Once you go in, it is cozy and warm. I received a very genuine, warm greeting by the hostess.  The restaurant reminded me of when we used to go out to \"fancy\" (kid lingo for fine dining) restaurants as a child in New York.  The drinks were traditional and made well.  One thing that was perplexing and contributed to the 4 and not a 5 was the cheese wiz cheese and packaged crackers they put on the table prior to the meal (not sure why that was happening).  Our meals came and everything looked yummy! I ordered the rib eye (med rare) and salmon (medium) with baked potato and cream spinach.  If you haven't tried putting cream spinach on a baked potato, just know it is FABULOUS!! Steak was flavorful and you can tell they used and open flame.    It was fairly clean on the inside, thought it could be a tad cleaner. Maybe I was biased after seeing the outside, maybe I just felt dirty walking in. lol.  All in All, good food, fair price, quant environment and good service.  Having all of these categories checked is better to me than having excellent service and crappy food or excellent food and horrible service.  I will definitely be back and I will definitely recommend this place.",

I would give it three-and-half stars instead of three if I knew how because it's good -- not the best steakhouse in the world by a long shot, but decent and worth a visit. I had a gin and tonic that could have been mixed a little better. Instead of some warm, fresh bread to start your meal, you're given a basket of Lance crackers and something that resembles cheese whiz. Oh well, you can live with that. I ordered the ribeye medium rare, with sides of rice pilaf and asparagus. The meat was almost (almost) perfect -- a nice, thick cut; well seasoned, perfectly cooked, juicy and tasty. My only quibble was that a decent chunk of this cut had too much gristle in it. The rice pilaf was only average -- too clumpy, not enough flavor (was there anything in there except rice? No onions?). The asparagus was better -- a BIG helping, tasty and not overcooked. The service was good, maybe because I got there fairly late on a weeknight and the place wasn't too packed. Most of the servers were busy vacuuming the floor and setting things up for the next day. My bill came to $50 -- not too bad considering the size of the ribeye and the massive side of asparagus. I would recommend this place as a decent spot to get good food with a very old-school, informal vibe.",

Some how he had a sixth sense to realize it was my birthday and made the day that much more special. Not kidding on the sixth sense he was a little off cause he asked if it was my dated birthday.

The French onion soup was the best we've ever had, perfection. The salad and dressing was fantastic and both our steak dishes were excellent. The ambiance was very 60's dinner club, and the wait staff was extremely friendly and fast. This place is not in the most frequented part of the city for fine dining but do yourself a huge favor and try it!    Can't wait to return.",

    "text": "So. Ive been here before. Steaks are second to none. Menu is great, service is great. But. And this is a BIG BUT. Be prepared  -  you are on a timer to eat. After dinner, for my mother-in-law's 60th birthday, and them kindly serving a chocolate mush with whipped cream and a sparkler for her (at my request, and free, for the record) I  asked for a dessert menu and a coffee. I was asked to wait a minute to see this that was ok. \"What?\" I know that's what you are thinking and is exactly what I was thinking.   Apparently there is an undisclosed policy that there is a 90 minute time limit for your meal. No idea if it scales based on your party size, but be sure to ask and avoid this place like the plague if you are intending on a cozy, relaxing meal.   Maybe in the future they will put an egg timer on your table so you can pace your food inhalation properly.  Really dissapointing when you are averaging 50-60 USD/pp to eat a full course meal.",

    "text": "I don't know whether to give the fifth star to the ghost or to the steak.  The Globe Road Part One  It wasn't having clouds of dirt kicked into my lungs by children, who if I had been able to get up from the dry-ass baseball diamond in the park and IF I could have caught them bicycle riding hooligans, I should have dragged their small fry tyrannical assets around by one foot in that dirt, just to show how it feels.   I had a friend to meet in the park. It's always good to meet people where, if you feel you are on decent footing with a business, you won't be seen. I felt that. All debts were paid, we had some months where we thought it was going to get a bit touchy, but all in all, we were seeing eye to eye and had business to catch up on. I say a friend like, you know a colleague, with whom I have previously done business and we had always gotten along. Pragmatic and easygoing, like most people who have had a drop or two of blood project into the eye from a bit too much fun-loving roughhousing after someone shows up with a lighter load than they should have. The kind of friend with whom when you have to relieve yourselves in a standoff that your girls enter the fray, take the pistolas so you can go, have a few more drams of mescal, and take the slug pushers back to continue the vigil. That kind of friend.  Apparently I need to pick my friends better because before getting dirtwashed by the guy, all I remember was his left hand and a pretty flash of gold make fireworks shoot from my  right eye.  No it wasn't that.  Maybe it was just the time and place.   We went to Beef and Bottle after my head cleared a little and I was able to tell my associates what I'd remembered.   There's two things, no three things about Charlotte, NC.   1. You can find a strip club on most any corner 2. You can barely find a place to drink 3. The service in this city is hands-down amazing across the board  We weren't looking for this place. I'll tell you that up front. We had found a Mexican joint right on the corner, but since the road to turn from the opposite side of the road is pretty odd and we had to take a hard right to u-turn it. No sooner had we laid eyes on the Beef and Bottle building, we were immediately in lovejoy.   This roadhouse shack that looked perfect for listening to Aerosmith and kicking anyone's ass that was stupid enough to look at me and my bruised eyehole in anything but the most obsequious manner.  Our black and chromed snub-nosed machine bumped up the curb and smoothed into the back lot, where I was shocked to see no Dixie flag waving from any tricked out pickemup truck. Here we were in the south for sh**s sake and at a roadhouse at that, and nary a car to tell me who my future bar fighters would be. My associates, very used to standing behind me by a number of feet, as my haymaker is as wide as it is deadly, begged me under their breaths to not start anything, to which I gave my most polite sound I could muster and walked in the door.  We all just stopped short as we adjusted to the low pink light. I wasn't alone when I thought that the place looked a steakhouse stuck in some type of watermelon jolly rancher colored fly trap.  The left eye adjusted a short amount of time before the other, which gave the room strange checkerboard appearance. Equalized, the checkerboard began to come into focus as Hollywood and Rat Pack type portraits and autographs dating to the  black and white portraits hung from the walls.  This change of expectation was almost as sparkly as my brass knuckle sandwich earlier that day. But the smell of Grilled steak and butter soothed my troubled soul like my baby's gentle red lips funneling her warm breath on my neck and onto the back of my ear. A Steak House!  Not just any steak house though. As we drifted in, the ambiance surrounded us. The tuxedo music and the dark wood walls and the pink lighting made everything as 1950's as it was any time. We could have been anywhere, plucked out of orbit, placed on an asteroid, hurtling toward and away from the sun, we could have been in SiriSiri BomBon, we could have been anywhere and this place would have made us feel completely flawlessly anywhere. In the dining room were quite tables of couples polishing off quantities of meat barely squaring a glare at us as would normally happen when a couple suits and a burly do-ragged leather wearing mother f@@ers walk in to most any respectable box. It literally was the rose light that made everything seem no less intense, yet non-threatening.  The waitresses there were all career women, even the cute petite blond who circled around us a few times over our stay. It was getting on in the evening, so none of us were really in the mood to share many improbable pleasantries. In fact the table behind us was filled with polished silver and glass to set the longish table w I ordered the fillet. Tho others ordered other meat cuts and to keep it all sanguine, we also had a house red brought to the table.",

Sat down right at 7.  My first clue should have been how fast our appetizer and salad came out. Our steaks came out pretty fast too.  Long story short we were finishing up our meal just slightly after 8.  Why is that significant?  Because as we contemplated dessert our waiter notified us that our 90 minutes were almost up and we likely wouldn't have time to order dessert unless we did so immediately.  I've never heard of a restaurant keeping a clock on customers but sure enough a manager came over to tell us each table has a 90 minute limit before they refuse to allow the customer to order anything else.  They have enjoyed the last dollar I will ever spend there.",

    "text": "Best steakhouse in Charlotte! Hidden behind the dated facade of a small building on South Blvd, you'll find a packed restaurant of locals who know where to find the best steak, staff, and salad dressing around!   A reservation is recommended, but not required - except you may end up with a very long wait time on a Friday or Saturday evening.   If you enjoy a kick of heat, start with the shrimp cocktail and go easy on the horseradish for your first shrimp. You'll find that the cocktail sauce will light you up - then you can gauge whether you can handle more on the next shrimp. More is better, but beware the nasal cleanse.   They have house-made salad dressings that make the house salad a great choice and you'll share a platter or vegetables to add. They also offer a Caesar salad that is equally delicious. (Not homemade, they'll remind you, but you still can't go wrong with it!)  Main entrees come in a number of varieties, but after the shrimp and salad, I stick with a simple filet, medium rare, and a side of potatoes. The onion rings are great, but each steak comes with an onion ring on top, so you get to enjoy one with an additional side.   Great place for a date or group of friends celebrating a birthday. Check it out!",

Native Charlotteans will swear by this place, but after my first visit, I suspect it's more out of nostalgia than anything else.   The wine list had some outstanding selections at prices to fit every budget, the signature Shrimp Cocktail appetizer was out of this world, and the service was excellent -- our party of 12 never felt like we had to wait for a server to attend to us.   But the steak itself was just OK. My Delmonico was tasty, but a bit overdone, and the filet my wife ordered was decent but forgettable. Yes, Beef 'N Bottle has some great character (although it could use larger restrooms), but with so many great steakhouses to choose from in the Queen City, this divey '50s holdout doesn't quite measure up.",

    "text": "\"I ate so much, my butt hurt\" - \"but in a good way\" - True quote  Yes, we had one of those meals where you consume such massive quantities of food that you gain enough weight to cause your legs and/or butt to fall asleep.   Beef and Bottle is straight up Hoboken New Jersey, Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack pimp. The only things missing are the velvet curtains and the ghost of Sammy Davis Junior.  It was no mistake that we ended up here on  1/2 price bottle of wine night and no mistake that Jon H and I were wearing bow ties so sharp they could cut through glass.  After the first bottle of Chilean Cab, it started raining appetizers. The Gulf oysters were so big and plump compared to their shells, I wondered if they had been evicted from their previous shells; that's what happens when shellfish don't pay their rent. The house cocktail sauce was loaded with fresh horseradish! Feel the burn! To this day I still have a piece of the cheese from the crock of House Made French Onion Soup lodged in my arteries, and I think I like it. Piping hot ooey gooey onion packed goodness! Warm crab dip- mmm. Build your own house salads with some of the chunkiest fresh blue cheese dressing I've had!  Our belly tanks were pretty much full when the main courses came. My Delmonico was cooked a perfect medium rare. If you've never had a Delmonico, you must - it's the heart of the ribeye and is packed with flavor. I ate half of her, until she twisted my arm and I said \"UNCLE!\". Well, that's what doggie bags are for. Tomorrow's breakfast = steak and eggs.  After loosening my pants - I tried the desserts that were passed around the table. The apple pie is so good you will take the Lord's name in vain and the Key Lime Pie will make you do an Olympic backflip (in your mind because you can't move at this point).  Our waiter informed us that the kitchen had recently been remodeled to maintain the quality and consistency of their awesome food. Now that's what I like to hear.   Bring plenty of moolah, plenty of good friends and wear pants with an elastic waistband!!",

    "text": "I know, I know, it's a Charlotte institution. Maybe I just don't get it. For me, Beef 'N Bottle is like reading The Great Gatsby; everyone tells you that it's amazing, but in the end, there are very few likable characters and you're left feeling like you wasted your time.  I'll start with the positives. I had no trouble making a same-day reservation, and we were seated immediately upon entering, even though we rolled in a bit early. Parking was a cinch. Our server was knowledgable and attentive. The menu is easy to navigate, and the kitchen is happy to customize your meal. Everything we ordered came out in a reasonable amount of time, and we left with full bellies.  There were, however, a handful of things that keep me from raving about Beef 'N Bottle like so many others. First, when our hostess seated us, she asked if we were celebrating anything that evening. I mentioned that it was my date's birthday. When our server greeted us a moment later, he came bearing glasses of champagne, declaring \"happy anniversary!\" Close enough.   The two of us were sat at a four-top table in the center of the restaurant. A wooden pillar was between our table and the next, and it's apparently used as storage for that folding table waiters use to support their trays upon serving. This led to servers reaching around us several times during our visit to grab the folding table and tossing it back with a clunk once their tables had been served.   We decided to start with a dozen raw oysters. I'm familiar with gulf oysters and know that their consistency is different from east coasters, but I still feel like you shouldn't *have* to chew your oysters. I could be wrong, but this tells me that those guys weren't at all fresh. Next we had the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were enormous and presented well. Our server mentioned that \"they like to make the cocktail sauce spicy,\" but even his warning didn't prepare us for the horseradish assault we were about to experience. I'll be sure to come back next time I have a cold, because that sauce cleared my sinuses within seconds.    Can we talk about the famous salad? While the bleu cheese dressing was exceptional, I can't understand why we're all so excited about building our own salads. The iceberg lettuce and provided toppings are basic at best, sliced too large for easy eating, and utterly wasteful given that the puny plate you're provided won't hold half of what you're served.   Our entrees came soon after. I had the filet and scallops, and I added crab meat on top. My four large scallops were served in a pool of wine butter sauce, which was easily the highlight of my meal -- my steak, though ordered medium, was quite dry and the butter was necessary. The scallops were tender, however, they still had the \"foot\" muscle attached, and both of us found shells in the crab meat atop our steaks. I can't help but feel that when you pay $50+ per entree, you shouldn't have to pluck inedible pieces out of your mouth.   Overall, Beef 'N Bottle didn't live up to the hype for me. Now that we've crossed it off our list, I can't imagine we'll bother with another visit.",

    "text": "Old School!  This is like no other steakhouse in this city!  What a great special occasion or date spot.  They have a cool setup in here, don't let the exterior ward you off.  Better make a reservation too, place fills up every weekend.  Now to the food!  We went with a group of six to celebrate our upcoming nuptials.  We got the large shrimp cocktail, it was really fresh and comes with homemade cocktail sauce!  That is a theme here as most everything that can be made in house, is. The cocktail sauce is spicy so get ready!  After that we all ordered our entrees which include a side of your choice and a salad.  Not just any salad but a do it yourself salad bar that is brought to your table. I know that you are not following me, let me explain.  You get a plate of lettuce, option to add cheese and bacon, I of course did.  Then they bring a plate of all kinds of salad veggies for yeh table so you can add what you want to your salad.  Then the most exciting part, they bring the homemade salad dressing boat for you to choose your favorite dressing or two :).  The ranch and blue cheese are too thick to pour, I repeat too thick to pour.  You kind of just spoon them on your plate, mix up your salad and fall in love with it.  I don't even normally eat much salad but this is salad plus plus.  After that they bring your steak, ny strip for me, in a plate of warm butter to just push the experience to the stratosphere.  I had a side of asparagus, on a no carb diet.  They were perfect but I want to come back for the giant baked potato!  They have a solid craft beer selection, incredible wine list and a full liquor bar.  All in all, just a wonderful dinning experience.  See you again soon Beef and Bottle!",

Ordered the oysters and shrimp cocktail as appetizers (should have ordered 6 shrimp instead of 20 for just two of us). The cocktail sauce was spicy, but not too much so. Oysters were plump and tasty. I ordered the 10 oz filet and wife ordered 6 oz filet and scallops scampi. Filet was perfectly cooked (medium rare) for both of us, and scallops were equally delicious. Server was very professional and paid us the right amount of attention. Will absolutely be coming back.",

    "text": "VERY GOOD . Very casual and who needs to dress to impress anyways? The food is what matters in my opinion. Step back in time. I have eaten at more steakhouses than most all over the USA. I'm visiting from out of state and working in Charlotte NC this weekend.  My work requires me to travel constantly coast to coast as well as internationally. So I have a lot to compare it to. Was the steaks spectacular ? No but it certainly was a step up from outback and other chains. I had the Filet Mignon (always my favorite) and lobster tail ,clam chowder ,sauteed mushrooms and I also gave the fired oysters a try as I'd never had this dish before. The clam chowder was amazing,the filets and the rest was cooked right. My waitress Crystal was on top of things and made sure I was taken well care of. All in all- I'd come back again. I give 5 stars ONLY to steakhouses where the filet mignon is so tender it can easily be cut with just a fork and no knife is needed. Beef and bottle needed a knife (as most places do) to cut the steak. Very good and I recommend it . Ask for Crystal if u want the best service .",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Beef & Bottle tonight for our anniversary dinner.  It had come recommended to us by co-workers, and we also had a Groupon giving us a discount.  It seemed like as a good a choice as any.  Driving into the parking lot the place looked like a dive.  Seriously - the place has NO curb appeal whatsoever.  I was a bit worried.  We walked in the entrance facing South Blvd. and I was afraid I'd fall - it was SO dark inside that it took me a full minute for my eyes to adjust.  However, once they did finally adjust I was charmed by the interior.  Like it was straight out of the 1960s, this place was all wood - on the walls, the seats, the booths.  I love \"old man\" restaurants, and this one perfectly fit that ambiance bill for me.  Food ordered: Frog legs and shrimp scampi for appetizer. We had never had frog legs before and figured we'd go for it.  They taste just like chicken!  And were delicious.  The shrimp was also good - the butter/garlic was great and I was happy that we had bread on the plate so we could dip and enjoy that garlicy butter even after the shrimp was gone.  We also got salads with the meal.  As other people have said, the salads are done as \"make your own,\" which was perfect for me.  I'm a minimalist with my salads.  I just want lettuce and dressing.  99% of the time when I get salads at restaurants I have to scrape off all the junk (cheese, carrots, tomatoes, cukes, etc.) and then I get to \"enjoy\" two bites of lettuce.  Not so at B&B!  I got to enjoy a full plate of lettuce with some of their home made ranch dressing (which was delicious as well).  Special sirloin steak with fries/baked potato for entrees. I ordered medium rare and it came perfectly cooked.  My husband ordered medium and it, too, was perfectly good.  The presentation was nothing fancy - just a piece of steak on a plate with a large onion ring.  The potato/fries came in bowls on the side.  This is not nouveau cooking.  But then, it's not supposed to be.  It's a steak place.  And my steak was delicious.  Buttery soft and just red enough in the middle to be close to rare - it was fantastic.  Chocolate silk pie for dessert. The slice of pie was huge - but a perfect serving for two people to split.  It had good flavor and was a nice way to finish the meal.  From beginning to end I thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  My husband did as well.    The only negatives were the drinks.  They didn't have the kind of liquor I usually drink, so I opted to have only water.  Their water glasses are very small, so I ended up having 10 refills during the meal.  Bigger water glasses would be better for the staff - our poor waitress ran a mile refilling my glass alone!  The other negative was the size of their beers.  It's a half pint if it's lucky.  But that's literally the only complaint I had.  This place is my new favorite steak place in Charlotte.  I will be telling everyone I know to check it out at their soonest opportunity!",

They were so tough that I had to ask for a steak knife to cut it.  It was sooooo terrible.  The best part was our arrival.  We made a reservation 1 week in advance for 5:30.  We got there at 5:20 and as we were pulling into the parking lot they were calling me on my cell phone asking me were we were.  I explained that we were walking in right now.  As we walked in, the owner yelled at me and told me and my guests that we would have to vacate our table by 7:00, no matter what.  If we were not finished, too bad.  We had to be out the door at 7!  As he walked us to our table the server gave us a sneer,and every time he walked past our table he tried to clear our salad or plate regardless if we were still eating.  He would not bring me a beer after dinner telling me that we did not have time.  Hope they get treated as badly as they treated us.",

This restaurant that has been around since 1958 is right up my alley. It looks like a little hole in the wall but once inside you realize what a hidden gem it is. Our party of four were greater by fantastic, attentive waitress (Diane) who has worked there ten years. Her attitude and service was perfect. We ordered a nice red wine, appetizers, and our meal. The appetizers consisted of the escargot and the two napkin (be ready for the heat!!) shrimp and sauce. Both were amazing. Two filets and two delmonico steaks were ordered with a baked potato, a sweet potato, creamed spinach, and giant \"tater tots\". Everything was cooked to perfection and were some of the best steaks and sides we have had in years.  We were too stuffed for dessert by veiled love to try them!  Thank you for turning a very hard, frustrating, stressful travel day into something memorable. If you are ever in the area please give this place a try!!",

I wouldn't have gotten the greatest steak at Outback, but I wouldn't have felt cheated either. Second visit I went with the kabobs. Haven't had those in ages and I felt the price was right. I liked the old school salad presentation. I didn't order the onion rings this time because they were cold on the first visit. The waitress recommended the home fried potatoes. Meal arrives and the beef on the kabobs had no flavor at all. Salt and pepper didn't even help. The home fried potatoes are nothing more than recycled mashed or baked potatoes formed into a giant tater tot type dish. This was equally bland. Could have easily been a great dish with some salt and pepper and some fresh herbs. Only way I'd come back is if someone else is buying. I'd rather spend my money on a great steak at Ruth Chris or Flemings",

Anyways seated and ready for to chow down I had originally come here because I heard they have a killer French onion soup which I was really craving, and since I was already here I figured let's just splurge and go all the way with it.  This would probably be one of the few times a year I eat beef I planned to gorge on it and have a meat hangover the next day. I selected a NY strip encrusted with bleu cheese, and side salad along with the french onion soup of course. The salad came out first while I was working on the complimentary cheddar and crackers, the presentation for this is kind of lacking, and cutting it up into more edible pieces was quite a challenge with only a butter knife to work with, but the ranch more than made up for it. Creamy dreamy goodness and you can tell that it was made with love. Next came the glorious french onion soup, steaming hot and topped with a nice crust of cheesy goodness! The only fault I could find was bread was a bit too soggy and was in the process of dissolving into the soup, but oh god the broth was incredible! Beefy flavorful goodness that leaves you with a warm comforting feeling, this is the epitome the feelings I think soup should stir in you when eaten. The steak brought out shortly afterwards sizzling on a hot skillet amused me a bit. Because that just meant I'd be waiting the 7-10 minutes for a steak of that size to \"rest\" or risk ending up with a less than satisfactory steak. I think they should have mentioned that because most people would just dig in and that would be a disservice to the excellent quality of steak they offer here. After waiting around and getting stared at by some fellow diners for just sitting around while a steak was in front of me I finally decided to cut in to it and the flavors were right on point. Perfectly developed and seasoned, however I'd say go a bit easier on the butter that you brush onto the steak before serving. I ended up just scraping the bleu cheese off because the steak was done so perfectly that I didn't feel like it needed it.  The service throughout all of this was impeccable. Personable, charming, informative, and attentive without being intrusive at all. I'd say one of the best services I've received in a restaurant so far. I don't really like the way the restaurant is set up but I loved the rest of the experience. Return trips shall have to be planned.",

I had a voucher from Liviing Social which was to expire in September 25th which I was going to use on the day but an emergency came up and I could not use it.  I called Living Social and asked what could be done they advised me to call the restaurant and ask for an extension to the following weekend which I did.  I asked for a manager and told him of my problem the answer was YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO USE YOUR VOUCHER GOODBYE!!!!!  There are so many fine steak houses in Charlotte that want to accommodate customers then why go to one like this.  After reading the other reviews on Living Social about the rudeness of the staff and their service much less there food I tore up the voucher why waste any more money on a 3rd class restaurant~~",

    "text": "I will start this review with the fact that I have had absolutely nothing to eat here.  This is because we made a reservation for 7:30 and upon arrival were snubbed.  We checked in with the host at 7:25.  At 7:32 an older man and his girlfriend walked in.  She immediately began rudely letting the wait staff know that they had a reservation and was concerned that they were not immediately seated.  At 7:34 she let them know again that they had a 7:30 reservation (same as mine).  The hostess then said, \"right this way\" and took them to their table.  As a reminder we were there before they were and had a reservation for the same time.  I inquired if there was a booth available since the couple that was just seated before us was put in a booth.  I was told that I had to request it for my reservation.  They then escorted us to a table that was a full 3 inches from the 4 top next to it.  At that point we started to walk out because we were not interested in eating with another party on our date night and were not happy about the way in which we had been treated.  The host intercepted us on the way out and apologized explaining that the person seated before us had been coming there for 40 years.  So, moral of the story, when making a reservation here first request a booth as part of your reservation and second pray that an extremely rude regular does not show up at the same time as the staff will rally around them and do nothing to secure a future regular!",

    "text": "After conducting an internet search while on a recent business trip for the best steak in Charlotte and wanting to avoid the high-end chains for a little something off the beaten path, I decided to try Beef and Bottle which was included on several Top 10 lists of the best steak in Charlotte. The first point of note is that parking is limited and there is no designated \"overflow\" parking so you have to take your chances parking in neighboring business' lot- I didn't have a problem, just a heads-up. Now to the service and food. After a brief wait for a table, I was seated in a small room with 5 tables with seating for two and one larger table. After being seated I waited at least 10 minutes before someone took my drink order and since I had plenty of time to review the menu I went ahead and ordered the ribeye with sauteed mushrooms and a bowl of she-crab soup. The soup came out quickly and was by far the best part of the entire dining experience- delicious! The service (re-filling water and drink) was average but very polite throughout the meal. The steak was average at best, but because it was $39 I would actually call it below average for the price. The steak, while cooked correctly at medium-rare, had very little flavor and was actually difficult to cut. It was served on a plate that reminded me of the old Western Steer / Sizzlin steak houses and I would actually equate the quality and taste of the steak to Western Steer / Sizzlin at twice the price. The bottom line is in my opinion Beef and Bottle is significantly overrated and overpriced.",

I am glad I ignored the low ratings as we had a wonderful experience.  In fact, it was one of the best evenings I have had in a few years.  The wait staff was attentive to us and did not rush our evening or bother for no reason.  It was a Monday night and not really busy, so would put into context, however the food was wonderful.  A build your own salad from a platter.  I selected the ranch dressing, however the waitress brought out a sample of others, namely the blue cheese which she said was not to be missed.  It was amazing.  We were not sure of wines, was brought a sample of each to try prior to a bottle which was half price that evening.  The food was perfectly prepared and an extra side was provided without charge.  We could not decide between three and only selected two, the cook sent out as not to miss either.  Cream spinach was incredible, usually not a fan.  We wrapped our evening up with a friendly chat and the last glass.  Thanked the staff for a personal and enjoyable evening at our own pace, what a great memory.  It's charm is not just with the caring service but also the building, something doesn't have to be shiny and new to be outstanding.",

    "text": "OH How I wanted to give B&B a better rating! Let me start off by saying that I AM a Big Fan of this restaurant! I've been here several times and each time has been really good. To me, this is \"old school\" steakery.....a Chicago or Vegas style steakhouse....dark, classic, limited menu but really good at what they do.  HOWEVER, this night, hummmm, they were off in a couple important areas. Let's start with.....  THE GOOD: The steaks! I have NEVER had a bad steak here. Seasoned perfectly and cooked exactly to Medium that way I asked. This was the 14oz ribeye. Just succulent flavors. Started off with the French Onion Soup. This was no reinvention of the classic here....great flavor and that yummy Gruyere cheese on top. I would have liked to see mine baked a tad more for that crunchy, slightly burned cheese on the top but that's just me. Their little bread sticks that come pre-buttered are yummy. Crackers and sharp cheddar cheese are more distractions than anything else but they are ok. Finally the Waitstaff. Sherry, who has been my waitress before, is always attentive, friendly and accomodating. Definitely a plus.  THE NOT SO GOOD: The Lobster Tail! This was just not fully cooked! It was rubbery, and next to impossible to eat. Had it not been for my Dad being there, I definitely would have said something to the Waitress. Normally I wouldn't sqwak about paying $19 for a GOOD lobster tail (and it was a good size), but this night it was a complete waste of money. The creamed spinach was cold and completely devoid of flavor. Finally, for some reason, this night must have been Rabblerouser night because my GAWD was everyone like yelling at the top of their lungs. I felt like I was in an English soccer pub watching Man U! Not exactly the quiet evening I was hoping for with my hard-of-hearing soft-spoken 85 year old Father!  THE SO SO: The fries. Not bad, not great. Average. The Caesar Salad. Not bad. Not great. Average.  Final thoughts - I just think Beef and Bottle had an off night. My advise to folks is always to mention items that don't live up to your expectation to the waitstaff or Manager. 9 times out of 10 (at least in this country) they will take care of you. I went with my Dad who unfortunately does NOT have a refined palate as he compares everything to the Golden Corral buffet (UGGGG) and thinks the salad is the best part of the meal. Oh well. Maybe I should have just taken him to Morrisons Cafeteria where he is most comfortable. But hey, my steak was great and I'd like to leave it at that.  I will definitely come back and see how they do next time. B&B you've got your \"mulligan\" from Paul.",

I finally went with my boyfriend for his birthday and we didn't leave as happy as I expected. I knew what to expect-- a run down old school building that serves crackers and a scoop of cheese as soon as you sit down. I can appreciate that. It was fun knowing that the food and experience has stayed the same since the restaurant has been in business. We were sat right away and greeted within a moment or so. We ordered the Cajun Crab Dip and received a thoughtful explanation of how each steak is made. Once we ordered the crab dip, our server did not return to our table for a LONG time. In fact... the table beside us ordered, ate, and received their bill before we placed our order. My boyfriend had to get up and ask another server for help. I understand that it was a busy night and our original server seemed to have another large table, but waiting nearly 25 minutes to order is ridiculous! She was very apologetic and made it up to us with a free dessert (which we were too full to eat by the end of our meal.) For 2 steaks and an app, our bill was $100 which was to be expected. The steaks were great, no complaints there, but they justtttt weren't amazing. I've had better at other restaurants. The mashed potatoes were very thin and almost...shiny? It was weird. The sauteed mushrooms were whole mini mushrooms that seemed to be poured out of a can into a bowl of salted butter. They tasted good, but kind of grossed me out. After we finished, we sat for a while and waited for our server to return. The tables around us cleared and another server cleaned and flipped them all before our server came back to take our plates. It wasn't a bad or good experience. I'm not sure that we will be back for a while.",

To those disappointed by the fact that there aren't any nekkid ladies inside, you can at least take solace in the surprisingly amazing fare that awaits if you score a table. And to secure a table, you'll either need a reservation or the patience to circle the lot for a parking spot and additional patience to wait comfortably on the padded bench in the romantically lit entry area. The prospect of said wait is a heck of a lot more appealing if you happen to be vying for a table on a Thursday night, ie while sipping on a half priced bottle of wine (so long as it's a bottle that's normally sub-$79 - you know, like Stag's Leap or one of the other gems on the menu).  Another aesthetic observation - the interior is dated and cramped... and actually pretty fabulous. I'm not sure how, but it just works. It's intimate and cozy, in a very 1970s kind of way.",

    "text": "Been to a lot of steak places over the years and went with a group of friends (5 of us) and heard quite a bit of build up from my friend who is local.    Visited the Yelp! page for them and felt pretty good going it (4 out of 5 stars and hundreds of reviews - good potential).  The reviews set me up to expect 2 things - 1) an expensive visit and 2) so-so service.    The place was busy on a Wednesday at 9p! pretty impressive!  We were sat without 2 of our party and the waitress came over suffering from allergies and croaked out a greeting.  We said that there would be 2 more and would decide on a wine maybe when they came.  I looked over the wine list as we were seated.  Our other friends came in and were seated right away.  Waitress returned and I said we were talking about the bottle purchase - she insisted that she would take those orders and shut me down from talking to our friends about wine! She was definitely pushing cocktails before the meal! - Strike 1 (I was paying!)  We ate a few of the plastic-wrapped crackers with the pimento spread (unremarkable) and we then placed our orders.  My fiancee and I decided to split a ribeye (my fav cut) & shrimp scampi.  We asked if there was a split charge and if we could have it split in the kitchen - yes to both.  I also ordered the french onion soup to see if it justified the $2 up charge - but when it arrived it was not cut in the kitchen as promised (no big deal - but Strike 2).  The steak was cooked perfect - I got the baked potato loaded and my fiancee got the mushrooms.  Delicious sides.  The scampi was delicious and heavy on the butter - it was in a pool of standing butter... nom, nom.  There was a rim of fat / gristle around the steak though and tender?  no - not really.  I;ve aged beef at home before and the claim of 21 to 30 days wet-aged beef was not represented in the cut I got.  Not tough as shoe leather, but not as tender as a ribeye aged 3 weeks in my opinion. Swing and a foul to the bleachers...   The third strike came when the waitress tried to strongarm me into a 'Mandatory Minimum Tip' of 20% - taking the time to point it out on the bill and making sure I understood it.  Really?  5 people, a bottle of wine (not on the 1/2 price bottle night) and a Mandatory Minimum tip?!   I enjoyed visiting B&B, but go back again?  Really need a reason.  The Rat-Pack decor was fun, but not for the price & quality we got. The help was less than interested in my comfort than her mandatory minimum tip.  Should have left the tip at zero and refused to be strong armed - didn't.",

At this point it was already 9:30 (with an 8pm reservation) so we decided to leave and go to Sullivan's steakhouse down the road. On the way out, the manager did not even so much as stop us or even apologize for the poor service. We watched several others walk out that night too. This place is relaying on their old school reviews and reputation and does not care about their customers at all.",

    "text": "Went back for my second visit and took my wife.  I'd raved about this place since the first time and I wanted her to see it, so we drove up from Columbia and spent the night in Charlotte.  Still love the atmosphere...nice and dimly lit, good place for a romantic atmosphere.  It is a little noisy, but not bad.  I once again ordered the Ribeye, medium rare, salad with buttermilk dressing and a baked potato. My wife ordered the small filet, house salad with blue cheese and asparagus.  We split a cup of French Onion Soup.  My wife took one spoonful and said it was too rich for her. She hated it.  I thought it was good...the beef broth base was a little strong but I still liked it.  She absolutely loved the salad and the blue cheese dressing. She liked how the salad was served with all of the salad items on a plate so you could choose which you wanted to add.  This is a nice touch.  She said it was the best Blue Cheese dressing she'd ever had.  Our steaks took a little longer than expected to come out, and when they did, the waitress said \"Don't touch the inner dish because it is very hot!\".  I took a bite of my Ribeye and the steak was warm, not at all hot.  My wife's Filet was good and hot and now problems.  It had a nice char on the outside and was done to medium as she requested. Her asparagus came very al dente, too much for her, and the stalks were not broken off at the large end, so they still had that hard, woody bottom to them.  Not good.  My steak was done to medium rare but I couldn't believe it was barely warm.  I touched the plate that was supposed to be so hot and it was barely warm itself.  I told another waitress about it and she took it back to have it heated up. She brought it back in about 3 minutes.  I swear they barely did anything to it.  It was still just warm.  I should've sent it back again but I ate it as it was.  I was very disappointed in the steak this time...not sure what happened.  It was my birthday and the waitress brought out a complimentary chocolate brownie with some whip cream and hershey chocolate frizzed over it.  Had a sparkler going in it when she brought it to the table.  Nice little touch so I took a couple of bites but didn't really care for it.   I'll still give this place four stars, but not the five that I gave it the first time.  I will go back and see if this was just a bad evening for them.  Sadly a little disappointed!",

To add insult to injury they had ceiling fans running. My (very yummy) steak was cold before I had finished and people around me were wearing coats during dinner. Wait staff was very polite but slow. Drinks went empty and we never saw the same server twice. I think we got lost in the shuffle of a shift change. The food is great but I really recommend spending your $100 in a place with walls, heat, and organized management. I won't be back.",

Shortly after dessert the host came over and said we had occupied the table for too long and we could either relocate to the bar or leave as another party was waiting. Needless to say, that's beyond rude. Never going back.   If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I realize it's a steakhouse but I went for the marinated chicken with shrimp. Absolutely to die for! Marinated with an Italian seasoning and cooked to perfection. The rice pilaf was amazing and I had some sort of potatoe cake that was out of this world! I found the price to be consisted with the quality of the food. We had several appetizers including the crab dip which was wonderful! I can't wait to go back! Ohh, and make sure you make anreser",

Steaks are very good, above average, fairly priced. Bottles of wine are easy to buy here with many options below 40 dollars but still with the high end options available. Service was decent, no standup bar area to my knowledge. The building could use a little update but I think they pride themselves on the older charm of this place. Worth checking out!",

We made a 6:00 reservation on a Friday night.  Our group was seated immediately.    The waiter brought the cheese spread and crackers out.  This was nice a unique old school approach.  For apps we ordered the shrimp cocktail and the crab dip.  The shrimp cocktail was subpar and the cocktail sauce was super spicy (if you like that kind of thing).  The crab dip was realllyyy good!    My husband and I split the 16 oz New York strip.  We added a salad and got the fried cheesy potatoes as a side.    Steak was pretty good, but the ribeye my father in law got was way better.  (We made a mistake)  The cheesy potatoes weren't what I was expecting.  They almost look like a crab cake.  They were tasty but a small portion.  The salad came out like a salad bar which was different and I liked it.  The homemade blue cheese dressing was on point.  We had excellent service and I'm glad we tried it, but honestly we will probably not come back because it's really expensive.",

The service was the slowest, and our server kept making excuses about being low staffed, etc. The table right behind us had two very loud small children. Why would you bring small children to a high class restaurant? The table next to us had a very inebriated couple, she tripping over her chair, sitting on her boyfriend's lap, spilling drinks and food. It took us 3 hours for 5 people to get through the dinner. I can't recommend this as highly as I used to, even though the steaks were very good.",

This steakhouse has been around for 50+ years and every time it's just as delicious as my last visit!   If it's your first time here you have to go with the filet combo ($40-$65 depending on side options). I always opt for the bourbon salmon. It's a kick of flavor in your mouth and so delicious! The filet cuts like butter- opt for medium rare. Solid. For sides you have to get the house salad. It comes with a platter of veggies so you can BYO. Plus all of their dressings are homemade. PS- Make sure you ask for a side of bread. It's infused with lots of butter. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The loaded baked potato is also a solid side option- ask for bacon and cheese if you're feeling naughty.   They have a nice selection of beer and wine- lots of red options. And the best part- the bartenders aren't light on the pours!   Lastly, I recommend making reservations because this place is always packed! If it's your birthday make sure you tell them- you will get a free brownie dessert. Yummy! Enjoy!",

I was slightly skeptical at first but was assured that the place was going to be well worth it. I was not disappointed. The ambiance of Beef N Bottle is like nothing I have ever experienced in person but only through old school mafia movies. Dim lit with old advertisements and pictures of once shining Hollywood stars hanging everywhere could only bring back nostalgic feelings for the older crowd I'm sure. The whole experience was unique. From the cheese spread and crackers to munch on to the make your own salad at the table idea. We had frog legs and oysters to start. Both were absolutely delicious. Then came the steaks. Ordered medium rare and it was delivered. Absolutely perfect. One of the best steaks I have had the pleasure of enjoying. Service was wonderful. Attentive and extremely professional.

The host came and got us when our table was ready, which was a few minutes before our actual reservation time. Service was good. The waitress indicated she was new and in training, but you wouldn't have known it otherwise. She was obviously experienced. We had Oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer. They were good, but overdone - baked a little too long. We had the filet and scallops and the salmon. Both were excellent. We had peanut butter pie for dessert. The only negative was that they were out of our first two wine bottle choices. We were offered a red blend that wasn't on the wine list, as an alternative.  It was good and did not detract from the meal.  The atmosphere is interesting, as tables are covered in white table cloths, lighting is very dim, but most people are casual and it is pretty loud in general. We enjoyed it and will be back.",

I always thought it looked old and dingy from the outside, but I finally looked it up once and it touted having some of the best steak in town.  Our anniversary ended up on a Monday where bottles are half off, so we figured we should try it!  I enjoyed it much more than I expected it to.  The place is small and dark, but clean and the staff was friendly.  The prices were reasonable for a steak house.  My ribeye was nicely cooked and the two sides that came with my dish were well worth it.  I'm so used to having to pay extra for your sides at a steakhouse, it seemed pretty worth it that they were included with your meal!  For entrees, a shared dessert and a bottle of wine, we spent about $80.  Not bad at all!  We'll definitely be back, probably on a Monday to enjoy their wine special :)",

It's no wonder that the beef n bottle has stood the test of time. We ordered the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and we loved it! The cocktail sauce was the best we've ever had. If your a fan of hit cocktail sauce then this is a must to order. They use extra hot horseradish with Texas Pete, Yes! For dinner they offer a few specials, tonight they had king crab legs and a filet, my wife loved it. I had the New York strip, it had a nice charred flavor and the cut was very generous.

    "text": "Heard many good things about this restaurant and saw a Living Social deal so we decided to give it a try. We made a reservation for Saturday at 5:30 for a party of four. Greeted by the staff and had a great waitress. My husband and friend ordered the French Onion soup suggested by the server who said it was great but \"takes a while.\" Those who ordered it enjoyed it.  All of us had steaks and they were very good as one would expect with prices of $25-$45 for main dishes.The salads are unique with a \"build it yourself\" set up. Dressings are made in-house. The side dishes were nothing special. Mashed potatoes were bland, asparagus looked wilted.  After dinner, we wanted to see the dessert menu and have coffee. The waitress said, 'I'm sorry but this table is reserved so you'll have to move to the bar if you want dessert.\" WHAT??!! I have never experienced this before and was shocked. I told the server that it was extremely rude to expect us to move. She went to ask the manager again to make sure and we were told that we still had to move if we wanted dessert. The manager never came over to explain or offer any concession.  So, will I go to this restaurant again? Probably not. The steaks were good but not good enough to be told we needed to move before our meal was complete...especially when our bill for four totaled $168.00 with the tip. That was with a $20 Living Social deal and only two glasses of wine.  In my opinion, offering a Living Social deal says that you're trying to increase business. Perhaps, if you treat your current customers with the respect they deserve and allow them to finish their meal and savor the experience you would get repeat business and save yourself the cost of additional advertising.  As for dessert? We left and went to Amelie's in NoDa and discovered a True gem in Charlotte...so for that, I owe Beef and Bottle gratitude.",

I'm in town on business and tonight I just wanted a simple meal of a really delicious steak and salad without all the pomp and circumstance that goes along with it at a place like Morton's or Sullivan's.  I had thought of seeking out the more casual Outback or Longhorn, but the food quality there is less than desirable.  Beef & Bottle really fit the bill.  It looks like a dive on the outside, but on the inside it's dark and cozy and a heck of a lot more welcoming than any of the aforementioned chains.  The steak was of very high quality, and I felt it was well worth the price tag for what comes along with your meal.  For $34 I got a fresh, crisp salad with a delicious house-made dressing, a tender, juicy filet mignon cooked to a perfect medium-rare topped with melted blue cheese, and a creamy baked potato on the side.  The service was warm and friendly, and the manager made it a point to make the rounds and be sure that everything was up to par.  So if you're in the mood for high-quality, simple food executed well without a side of attitude, do yourself a favor and check out Beef & Bottle.",

I've eaten here many times over the years and everything (yes everything) is delicious.  Martinis are excellent, wine options go on for days and the steaks are out of this world amazing.  Their shrimp scampi (to me) is a contender for the best item on the dish.  When in doubt, order a steak.  You won't be disappointed.  Be careful, this place is addicting.

I ordered the filet ($42) which came to me rare though I ordered it medium to medium rare. It was a softball shaped thing that would've benefitted from some hand-trimming.  My husband's strip steak was barely edible. Once you removed the fat on the sides and hacked through to the the meat, you realized that this steak was about 6oz.  Everything else was fine but not spectacular. I'm mystified by all the reviews stating how wonderful a place this was for special occasions. It's a pretty dumpy little place that has a weird room at the entrance with a man working alongside computer equipment looking for all the world like a campground check-in hut.   The bill (his strip, my filet,1 glass of wine and 1diet coke) was right at $100.  In that range, you could go to one of the many places Charlotte has to offer.  Every experience is unique. I heard so many wonderful things about this place and really though it might hold a candle to Peter Luger's in NY (best steak in the world, hands down) but no. Maybe it was an off night or all the cows were suddenly chewy.  To each his own and some people might find the laid back atmosphere appealing. For me, a $100 dinner should have crystal and gorgeous ambience, skilled waitstaff and the most mouthwatering, tender cuts from a cow possible.  Here, we felt there was a chance that the Chocolate Silk Pie could be chewy.",

    "text": "Interesting spot.  This place carries off the atmosphere of a 50's supper club.  The wife and I both had steaks and both were delicious.  The sides were great and cocktails were well made.  What's not to like?  Well, you really, really, really need reservations here.  We dropped in on the weekend and managed to get a spot at the bar for dinner.  I'm more than ok with eating at the bar (I actually like it better than a regular table), but when a place is this crowded, it becomes difficult.  If they manage to find a way to do crowd control, this place will move up to 5 stars for me.",

    "text": "We have been to this restaurant many times over the years and had excellent meals.  About 3 years ago, we had such a bad meal, we stayed away.  A couple months ago we thought we'd give it another try.  We had reservations for a booth and arrived 20 minutes ahead of time and were promptly seated.  After we ordered our cocktails, the waitress pushed us to order.  We generally like to enjoy our cocktail before we order our meal.  We were informed that we were only allowed to keep the table for 1 1/2 hours.  My husband asked for an exception because that was ridiculous.  Since they said no, we decided to enjoy our cocktail for 1 1/2 hour and eat elsewhere,   My husband engaged in a friendly conversation with another table. The manager came over and told us we had to leave because of this.  I couldn't believe he insisted we leave for talking to another patron, but said if we didn't leave immediately he would call the police. He was nasty and totally disrespectful.      Many people try this restaurant because it is an institution in Charlotte, however, this was sold 3 years ago and has a new owner.  That explains why the quality of food and the treatment of patrons has gone down hill.  We have eaten at Morton's, Ruth Chris and other fine restaurants and have never been given a time limit at our table.  Actually expensive restaurants expect people to linger.  This new owner charges high dollar for mediocre food.  He wants to turn tables to make money rather than insuring a great experience for the customer.  he is relying on the long reputation of a previously great restaurant.  I give him a couple of years before the place closes.  I have talked to too many people who had poor food there that won't return.  What a shame.",

    "text": "My son and I wanted a place to dine last minute New Years Eve, after calling around, everyone was booked obviously weeks in advance. I remembered a little jewel of a restaurant from the past and looked it up on line. It was still going strong !  Called, and they were booked also, but told me they has some high tops(small 2 person tables) in the bar area that were first come, first serve.  So we headed out, and arrived around 8:00pm.  Place hasn't changed outside, nor inside in thirty years.  Movie stars framed on walls, white linen tables and booths,separate back room with small bar and 2 tv's.  Was greeted at the front door, and welcomed as family.  Led to the high tops and didn't even have to wait to sit ! You could sense the dimly lit atmosphere and old school Sinatra music was foreplay to the food orgasm that was soon to happen. The totally new kitchen addition that was added months prior hidden behind aged walls with so many stories to tell of celebrities that have dined here over the decades.   The wait staff was genuinely friendly and eager to help and even the ones that walked by would recognize others and say hello, sometimes adding to a story or experience, treating everyone as family. I quickly realized this place would be a great addition to my regular dining spots, even though it's located directly across town from where I live and work(45 mins).  Anyway, great steak, fish selection with abundant sides.  Salad is huge if that's one of your side choices(two sides included) I ordered the filet mignon and crabcake combo ($40.00) and this is the only place that can cook it my way every time ! (I prefer medium to med-well, pink inside and no butterfly)Mashed potatoes and asparagus (both in separate dishes as they are plentiful) The wine selection is extensive, as is the beer menu.  They have a corkage service also if you want to bring your own. Guests I have brought have eaten Lobster, and other items and always said the food was great. I tend to stick with the steaks. The friendliness of the entire staff is another reason to return, but the food will keep you coming back.  So, if you like non pretentious cozy atmosphere with great people who will remember your name and treat you like family, and superb food at reasonable prices,then this place need to be on your radar !  Since, I now try to dine here every other week or so.   Thanks Ron, Rick and staff !!   See you next week...",

The cook knocked it out of the part with my medium rare filet mignon and King crab legs! Prepared to perfection. Our server was amazingly attentive and her wine knowledge exceeded my expectations. The owner, Rick, was so hospitable, he even gave us a historical overview of the establishment. Thanks Beef and Bottle for a fantastic evening and a lovely memory of Charlotte. We will be back in November!!! Amy, Robyn and Cristi",

I ordered my steak medium rare, and both times it came out medium well to well. The second time the steak came out gray and cold.... I have no idea how that is even possible. The waiter was very nice and apologetic, and certainly earned a decent tip, but I won't be going back to a steak joint that doesn't know how to prepare a steak.",

My best friend and I went to dinner for a girls night, we loved the way the outside looked- nothing fancy, but clean. That generally bodes well. So we get inside and are asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't, but were seated right away.  Our server was Chip.  Chip was a FANTASTIC server, I've never had someone spend so much time explaining the menu, the specials, and made sure all my questions about the cuts of meat were answered.  It was half priced wine night, we split a bottle of moscato and it was delicious.  My friend ordered the filet with Caesar salad and fried potato bites, she was very pleased.  I ordered the Delmonico with salad and fries. I was completely blown away! It was cooked perfectly medium and was so juicy and tender.  Normally when I order steak out I use sauce and I used none for this steak. I am seriously impressed.  We shared the apple pie for dessert which was also delicious.  Thank you, Chip, for giving us a wonderful dining experience!",

    "text": "My husband and I were celebrating 19 years of marriage and wanted to try something new. Made a reservation same day and was excited as I had heard good things about this place. Got seated right away but in the side room which was interesting. The tables were crammed in there, but I was with my husband and I was ready for a nice dinner. There was cheese and wrapped crackers for us to enjoy on the table. Let me highlight that I love dive diners and am not in any shape or fashion a rich snob. However, the cheese spread reminded me of cheezwiz and although I love me some captain wafers, bread would have been nice. Our waitress comes by and tells us that she guess we are her table and that they got the numbers all messed up. Oh ok, thanks for that info. She then takes our drink order but seems confused. I order a glass of wine and my husband asks if the OMB on tap is the copper. She says that they don't have OMB but they do have Old Mecklenburg and that she does believe they have copper. Ok, not a good sign, but my nice husband said that sounds great and thanked her. We order our food and all throughout the waitress informs us of every upcharge with the dollar amount that is included with our order. I was dressed casual dressy and my husband looked nice. We weren't in black tie outfits but we didn't just roll out of bed. I am in my late thirties and by all means can afford the two dollar upcharge for my husband's loaded baked potato. I don't need to to make sure that is ok. She brings out drinks and my husband's beer is wrong. She of course had already jetted and he couldn't tell her. He was sweet and waited patiently. My wine tasted like rubbing alcohol and was obviously the bottom of last night's bottle but I drank it and didn't say anything. Our soup and salad comes and I tell the waitress that my husband's beer was wrong and she says ok and brings him the right one. When she does she informs us that they had the wrong label on the taps and that is why she brought the wrong one. We were like ok, thanks and no problem.  The salad was a plate of lettuce and a plate of fixings. I thought it was wasteful and a bit of a pain to serve it this way. The fixings were large and I had to cut up everything before mixing it with the lettuce. This was a lot of work and I didn't use majority of what they brought. Our steaks come and again the waitress drops it off and jets. I ordered medium rare and eat a couple of bites from the outer part and notice that it is pretty chewy. I cut in the middle and find that my steak is cooked medium well. I then have to wait over 15 minutes for another server to come by so I can tell them. He says do you want them to take it off your bill or do you want another steak?  I wanted to eat my steak. I told him i would like another steak. I waited another 15 minutes and a different waitress brought me my new steak which was rare, not medium rare, but honestly at this point I didn't care. It was better because I was taking it home anyway and it would be fine when I heated it up. I did tell her that I was disappointed that our waitress didn't stay around to see if my steak was cooked to my liking and that she was no where to be found for the last 30 minutes. She said that she understood and would let the manager know. I didn't care to tell the manager but thought maybe I could spare some other couple this experience if I was honest. Of course the manager never came by. Our waitress did finally come by to give us our check and to box our food. I told her we would box it ourselves. We paid and I did leave her 11%. I normally leave 20-30% but she was awful. I will never be going back to this place. The beef was not cooked right and the bottle stunk.   Was a pricey crappy meal. Pay a little more and get your money's worth at Ruth Chris!  Pay less and get better service at Texas Roadhouse.",

I had no complaints that night.  The food was lovely as was the atmosphere.  Fast forward to tonight.  We had a 5:30 reservation for a birthday celebration.  At 7:09 we were told that we needed to leave as the table was spoken for.  Now granted we were winding down anyways, but A) this was a terrible business practice and B) yes the table was spoken for, BY US.  They knew we were celebrating a birthday and did bring out a very lovely birthday surprise for the birthday girl.  But for 60 bucks a plate I do not expect to be rushed out the door.  So now that we've gotten the service outta the way - onto the food, this is a restaurant after all.  Well, my meal of tenderloin tips was super salty but still pleasant.  The dessert (key lime pie) was really good.  My dining companions had the special - a prime rib/ shrimp combo.  They said the shrimp scampi was really good, but they've had better prime rib.  I'm just flummoxed, why would Beef and Bottle risk alienating customers?  I sure as heck won't be back.  Oh and I got sick from my meal - not sure if it was me or them, but after being rushed out the door I'm gonna say it was them!  I will not be back.",

It was a group of 6 (2 children included)After research we decided on this place.  From the moment we walked in we immediately felt unwelcome because we had children. The hostess was not friendly everyone else was sat before us even though we had reservations....  Customers of the restaurant were even overheard making comments \" wow kids in this place\". From the time we sat down everything seemed to be a problem. The server constantly repeated that we had children.... Almost like as if  if we're a problem that we had children.  Our waitress was not attentive at all from the Start. The service by our waitress was Awful our drinks were constantly empty... We had to  ask the same questions over and over ... We had to ask her over and over for simple things like drinks, bread, or crackers. After 20 minutes after being finished with our dinner....  the bust boy came by (which I add was the nicest gentleman of all the staff). We had to ask him for our check he then told us that our waitress was in the other room.... Whatever that meant.  Also the waitress hand wrote her tip on our ticket ... Which she wrote in 21.00 on our receipt because I guess she felt she deserved 20%. She counted our 2 five year olds that didn't order anything in our group therefore she could add her own tip for a group for 6 or more.   Needless to say we will never be back... For the simple fact of how we were treated.",

Walking into the restaurant is like being in a time warp--back to the early 60s when the Rat Pack ruled Vegas and Hollywood stars were larger than life. The decor is old. The publicity pictures plastering every square inch of the walls are even older. The lighting in the main room is dim. It's all part of the charm of the place.  Kitchen, however, is apparently state of the art after a major renovation. We didn't see it, but the results delivered to the table were delectable. French onion soup--terrific! Black and bleu ribeye--awesome. Server was terrific and very knowledgeable. Gave great advice re selections.   Will be back. With friends next time.",

They give you some pretty decent cheese spread & crackers to start with (always love the little freebies!) and they will give you more if you ask. salad dressings are made fresh there - that's a good thing and they bring out all the salad add-ons family style so you can add as much or as little as you want. Wait staff was excellent! Food was okay - sorry...i really wanted to be over the moon with the food, but it really just okay.  The Ribeye was cooked perfectly at Med Rare but was a super fatty piece of meat and really lacked any discernible flavor.   I would go back though as it was charming little place and I like eating at local mom & pops!  Next time I would try some appetizers & the fish/seafood.",

The server we had, Dave A. tried to charge us for several items that we did not order thinking we would not notice. When we called him out he tried to say other waiters rang it in our tab which was clearly a lie because it was listed out by seat and it was the exact beers we ordered. Doubt I will be back.  ALSO- the waiter told us that gratuity was included with parties of 4 or more. This wasn't done in the system it was manually written out by the waiter.",

Our waiter (David I believe) greeted us quickly and was on the ball with our byob wine. That's right, you can byob with a $15 corkage fee.   We started with the crab dip (spicier than you would expect!) and we all got steaks. Everything came out correct and we were all very happy with our food. I had the 6 oz. filet with baked potato and loved every bite.   I think everyone knows about the ambiance, but just in case - think wood paneling and a major flashback to the 50s/60s. Oh and don't let me forget about the pub cheese & crackers + a plate of veggies for your salad. Oh for the good ol' days.   My only gripe is the prices. It is a little hard for me to spend the same here as Del Frisco's. But as my husband keeps reminding me, they are doing something right if they are booked out weeks in advance - so what do I know! I'll go once in a while for the nostalgia factor, but not every time I'm craving filet.",

    "text": "After 14 years in Charlotte we decided to try it. The reviews were inconsistent so we figured we would judge for ourselves.   In summary it was a sh$& show. 2 stars was generous.   I don't want to go into all the gory details so here is the quick and dirty version.   Ambiance - road motel meets gas station meets bonanza. It was so cheesy that they spray paint their bulbs to a red dim light rather then spending an extra .$15 for a colored bulb.   Service - horrible. I've had much better and attentive service at fast food joints. Water refill asked 5 Times.; Wine-Delivered wrong bottle; clean plates-had to beg other wait staff to address. Pathetic.   Food - meh. Crackers with weird cheese scooped with an ice cream scooper. Onion Soup was a solid 3-stars. The salad was very strange even though the blue cheese dressing was good and the veggies were fresh - it was presented in a weird cafeteria style help yourself mode. However that was probably the highlight of the food. The steaks were a choice cut and were fairly bland. We certainly did not feel they warranted the $45 price even though that included a side and the cafeteria style salad. We opted for the apple pie with ice cream and that was edible but certainly not memorable.  Miscellaneous- you get bread after your meal entree arrives which is the first time in over 35 years of dining that I had seen that. The bread itself isn't traditional rolls or bread but very thin and garlicky toast which we were not fans of. The glassware and stemware was of the cheapest quality. The knives, forks and spoons appeared to almost bend by look alone. Glassware was Walmart.   If you want a cheesy old steakhouse that caters to very \"mature \" patrons, this is your place. If you want a good steak with phenomenal service try Del Frisco's or Sullivan's.   The 5-star reviews boggle the mind. You have been warned...  We will certainly never be back.",

Let me rewind to the wine selection...great selection of wine and we happened to go on half priced wine night.  the cheese and crackers are decent.  Taste but move on.  You seriously want to save your appetite for the steak, wine ,and dessert.    The salad was just okay for me but the dressing was fantastic.  Homemade and so yummy.  Husband got the French onion soup and I got a little starter jealous.  Definitely, go with the French Onion Soup!  It was not too salty, the croutons and cheese were perfection.    I got the loaded potatoes and he got loaded mashed potatoes.  I thought the potato was a waste, because all I wanted was to finish the steak.  I ate it.  Hubs devoured his mashed potatoes.    He got the filet with red wine butter.  I got the filet with the blue cheese crumbles.  Medium rare, is where it is at.  Best temp for this steak and perfectly cooked!  We both loved our choices.    We got the SuperTusxcan wine...perfect with the steak.    We had a bit of an overly cursing neighbor.  They quickly put an end to his evening, in the most subtle way.  No drama in this establishment   Such a great meal and great recommendation from the best yelpers!  Thank you!",

    "text": "Again, I have to make a disclaimer that I don't eat steak.  However, I had a bite of my mother's steak and WOW!  I just might eat steak here!  This was my first visit.  My mother was in town and as a somewhat late Mother's Day dinner, I took here here.  I happened to have made reservations the day prior, and I'm glad I did because there was a sign on the door that night saying the restaurant was working on a reservation-only basis.  I'm not sure if this happens a lot, but knowing this, I highly suggest you make a reservation, even if you think it may not be needed.  The server asked if we had visited before and when we said this was our first visit, the server gave us some basic history, recommended the most popular sides, and gave the night's special.  The ambiance is low lighted with white linens.  Looks upscale inside but I certainly felt comfortable dining in less-than-business casual dress.  I sat in the club area, in the back by the bar.  It was very loud back there.  I can't see that area as being intimate or romantic, as this restaurant suggests on their website.  Crackers of the saltine, Club, and Melba Toast varieties are complementary at the start of the meal and are served with cheese butter.  I ordered the clam chowder and fried flounder with onion rings and rice as sides.  The clam chowder was thick and chock full of clams.  Unlike many clam chowders I've had in the past, this had zero presence of \"sand.\"  In addition, there was a slight smoky flavor from bacon.  The flounder was lightly breaded and fried.  It was fried to a perfect crispness outside and still flaky and moist on the inside.  The tartar sauce, a very simple thing to make, was fantastic!!  I also must add that the tartar sauce was not needed since the fish was so flavorful.  The onion rings were thick and sweet, but I found the breading to not have much flavor.  The rice was just OK.  It looked appetizing and was flavorful, but I was off put by the stickiness like it was leftover from the night before.  The server was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  I broke my take out box for my onion rings.  When I asked for a new box, the server just gave me a fresh order of onion rings.  Hands down the best dining experience I have ever had.",

You have to have the right expectations when you visit this restaurant. The outside of the building is unassuming and you could easily pass it without knowing they have some of the best steaks in town. The inside is very dark and kind of kitschy with the rat pack posters and signed pictures of famous actors at each dimly lit table. Christmas lights are strewn throughout and ceilings are very low. You want intimate, you got it. I previously remembered the service being outstanding. This visit kind of caught me off guard. I Asked my server to tell me about one of the wines by the glass on the menu and was subsequently responded to with a \"well, what do you want me to tell you?\" coupled with a puzzled look. Didn't really set the right expectation off the bat and my Dad and I both looked at each other bewildered. The server later tried to redeem herself after she realized she probably pulled her \"back of the house\" attitude to the \"front of the house\" where it didn't belong. Get the Delmonico steak. It's flavorful and really quite good. Their sides are pretty spot on as well. Bring your own bottle of wine if you want anything decent. Their wine list is lack luster for a steakhouse. I don't want to steer anyone away from this restaurant, just want to set the right expectation.",

The crackers/cheese spread (seriously at this price point?), house salad and side dishes were uninspired, the restaurant is VERY dark and the place hasn't been remodeled or updated since it was built in the 1950's. The median age of clientele the night we were there was over 60, looked like mostly regulars who've been going there for decades.

The creamed spinach is to die for... and the steaks were just as good, if not better than Ruth's Chris-level restaurants.  I had the 12 oz Delmonico and my friend ordered the 16 oz Sirloin.

We only had to wait about 15m for a table which wasn't too bad. We ordered the Cajun crab dip, it was yummy. I love the fact that all the salad dressings are made in house. The presentation for the salad was unique, it's never been presented to me in that fashion. I had the ribeye and loaded mash potato for dinner. Finally an establishment that knows what a medium steak is supposed to be. It was so good, and nice and pink. Or waiter Seth was talkative but I enjoyed it because he was so upbeat and I loved that. My husband ordered the seafood platter fried, and he said he enjoyed it, while I didn't try it everything appeared to be cooked to perfection. He's a picky eater so I was worried he wouldn't enjoy it, but luckily he did. So score!",

The conversation with her is pleasant yet personable but just enough that it's not drag out. I ordered the prime ribeye steak with the lobster tail. It was perfect. Steak was medium done which hit it on the head. The lobster was done right and have a nice sweet taste to it. The potato was just the way I like it. Sour cream and butter, nothing fancy.  My wish is that they can step up their salad a bit. I like that you can make your own with all the fixings. But for a place like this. I was expecting a nice spring mix or some else than just iceberg as the base. However their homemade ranch dressing was to die for. Wish I could've buy a jar to take home.  Everybody should bookmark this place. It's fancy but still have a laid back feel. Not soo stuffy. I would stop by for lunch one day!  Advice: it's best to make reservation!!!",

    "text": "This was the 2nd time we have been.  Both for Birthday Celebrations.  We had a reservation...don't go without one.  Had to wait at bar for a while, but that was no problem.  Waiter was very friendly, but it did take a long time to order between bringing wine...entire meal took 3 hours, so order when you see your waiter.  It's hard to hunt them down because they are busy.  The cheese dip is awesome, ask for an extra one to take home if you have leftovers.  The salad dressings were fantastic.  My 6oz filet was perfect.  Melted in my mouth.  My husband got the black and bleu ribeye.  The steak was great, but not as good as the filet.  Each entree comes with a side, but they are good sized, so plan on sharing with your family.  The waiter brought an ice cream/brownie for my husband's birthday with a sparkler.  That was a nice touch.  We also had the chocolate silk pie...awesome.  Only complaint was that our salads came out about 2 minutes before our steaks came out.  The waiter apologized and just said that he didn't want to bring us cold steaks by having them wait back in the kitchen.  He offered to redo any steak if got cold before we were able to eat it.  I went straight for the filet and put the salad to the side for later.  Glad I did.  Mine was hot.  My husband finished his salad and his steak had cooled too much.  He didn't complain about it though.  Ambiance is old school, but who cares, the food was pretty amazing and you feel like you are in good company with everyone around you.  It's not the least bit pretentious.    Makes for a perfect birthday celebration and it won't break the bank.",

    "text": "I have heard about this place for years and the chefs for a very upscale particular (but will not be named) restaurant Uptown personally labled this as the absolute best place in Charlotte to get a steak.  Thanks to a Living Social deal, I got to experience this myself.  As other reviews have mentioned the exterior does not appear that it has been updated in at least three to six decades. There are no windows outside so the place looks very shady. Or, or just like an old school steak house where the Rat Pack would have dined.  Once you walk in you can tell this place is something special. It is pretty dark, seemingly illuminated by only the candles and single light at the booth tables (there are actually more, you won't trip in the dark). The ambience seems like the perfect place for a special anniversary or to conduct underground business deals. At times I wasn't sure if someone was going to propose or the FBI was going to bust in.  As for the food, I wish I had a bigger budget because even with the Living Social deal, this place was very expensive for two people. My roommate and I had $40 off and still spent $60 combined on our meals and desert and tip (full amount regardless of deal). If I had more I would have been daring on some starters because they serve frog legs, escargot and baked oysters.  However, I loved what I got. I will say it was a gloriously tender ribeye steak served medium to absoulte perfection. I'm pretty handy on grill and have eaten a ton of steaks and I think this is the probably the second best one I have ever had. Truly delicious. I don't know how much more one can say. Seriously top two steaks I've ever eaten (the best was in Knoxville, Tennessee of all places).  The wait staff was a little slow to get us started but once they did, they were fully attentive and if our waitress couldn't make it to our table in time, another passing by would top off out water or clear a plate without hesitation.  Because we could only use one LIving Social deal at a time, my roommate and I will be back. And I CAN NOT WAIT!  (Why a four star and not a five? Price and price alone. I'm typically a penny pincher so it is tough for me to spring that much and give a five star to a place most, including me, can't afford. Still worth every penny if you can.)",

It may seem like the kind of place and the kind of food your grandparents would have enjoyed in a date night in the seventies, but when you get it right the first time... Their creamed spinach is luscious, salad comes with thickly cut everything (even radishes!). There is nowhere to go in town for a better prepared surf & turf & glass of wine.  Keep an eye out for the most enthusiastic, delightful busboy in the SouthEast - Chip. He's always there & always working his tail off with a huge grin.",

A group of friends and I met for dinner and drinks this week and of the 4 of us, 3 of us raved and one was kind of meh.  That's what she gets for ordering fish at a place called Beef and Bottle I guess :)  I went with a cup of French Onion soup to start and had a combo small filet and fried shrimp for the entree with onion rings for the side.  All entrees come with a salad which is a plate of iceberg and then another plate for the table to share with onions, peppers, cherry tomatos, celery, cucumbers....  The dressings are homemade and I went with the blue cheese which was a mighty fine choice.  The soup was good, not too salty and had a crunchy, melty topping of cheese on top.  I was wishing I had gone with a bowl vs. a cup!  My steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare with a decent char and had good but not great flavor.  Next time I'll opt for a NY Strip I think.  The fried shrimp were also good but not great with a decent taste but they were a little dry.  We happened to show up on half-price wine night and it applied to both bottles and glasses which was nice.  They don't have an extensive wine list by any stretch but, it's serviceable.  What we all liked the best was the atmosphere.  Dark, with little candles casting just enough light to read the menu and see your food while still allowing us all to look about 15 years younger.  The service was casual and friendly and fit the place perfectly and the joint was packed almost the entire time we were there and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Not even close to the best steak I've had in Charlotte but, that's not everything in a meal.  No doubt that I will come back.",

Don't expect your typical stuffy steakhouse. This place is straight out of Goodfellas. The walls are decorated with 50s movie stars, there are no windows and the place has most likely not been updated since it opened in 1958. But don't let the exterior fool you, this is one of the best steakhouses in Charlotte.   We started with the oysters and they are huge!! Served with their homemade cocktail sauce that serves quite a kick.   The salad is pretty basic and family style. But the entrees... Holy wow. Best steak I've ever eaten. Ask for yours black and bleu! The creamed spinach was one of the best things I've ever tasted and the baked sweet potato should be served as a dessert!   Our server, Lesley, was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. My fiance's dad even said he doesn't want to go back to Del Frisco's or Sullivan's and only wants to go back here for steak. Needless to say we'll be back!",

As we pulled up the outside of the building certainly didn't represent the overall experience. As our server said once seated you think you are pulling up to an old school strip club. Don't let the outside deter you though.   Our server made the experience one of a kind. Forgot her name but she was spot on and gave some excellent recommendations. Each entree comes with salad and a side. All dressings are homemade, the 1000 island was very tasty. They also bring out crackers with a sharp cheddar cheese ball.   I ordered the snake in the grass, the special of the night that was a 12oz ribeye topped with sauteed spinach, onions and melted Parmesan. THE BOMB!!! ($32)  All cooked perfectly. Server suggested loaded mashed potatoes which were a great addition.   My table of 4 all said they'd definitely come back again. Dropped one star due to dated exterior and interior. Very dark inside but what do you expect for a steakhouse established in 1958...except maybe update some along the way!!",

Management was initially oblivious and uninviting when finding our reservations after giving first and last name. 2. Interior and exterior is outdated and dirty. 3. Unappealing white Christmas lights hung aimlessly around the restaurant as ambiance? LOL  4. Crackers with canned cheese instead of fresh bread and butter? Might as well serve lance crackers out of a vending machine.  5. Tight and cramped seating arrangement.  6. NY Steak was very bland.  7. Cheddar potatoes were FROZEN and not fresh without any Cheddar taste.  8. Vegetables for the salad were separate and not properly cut. (Is it common to have chopped celery on a salad??) The Ranch was awesome!  9. Wait staff was friendly however inattentive with water.  10. I would like to know their health sanitation score because later that night I did not feel well.  I see my opinion is unpopular on yelp but I hope this review was helpful. Thanks for reading.",

The three different areas of the restaurant also provide a great variety of environments for any occasion. We prefer the Atrium since it feels more casual, and has a couple tvs set up. The service is exceptional, and the food is great. The crackers and soft cheese are a unique touch. The price is also pretty reasonable compared to other places, and most entrees come with soup/salad & choice of side. The wine list is solid, but we prefer to bring our own since the corkage fee is only $15. Hands down, Beef 'N Bottle is our favorite place in town for any occasion.",

A steakhouse that welcomes tank tops and cargo shorts (who still even wears those?!) or a fancy dressed up couple is my kind of spot.

Well with it if you're with a group. The staff is attentive and the environment is unique. They kitchen was recently completely remodeled and when we asked about it, the manager let us take a look. Who does that!? I highly recommend Beef and Bottle to anyone and everyone no matter what your wearing or who you're with. Just go get you some steak and let this place impress you!",

We are a group of NATIVE Charlotteans (rare) that have known B&B to be our \"go to\" place for a dependable great meal and ambiance.  We have had many good times and fabulous food in the past years. Maybe the days of \"old\" are over with B&B too.    Reservations were @ 6:30.  A few of us were late.   This is the KICKER......Did not know until we got there when the lady that had made our reservations had been TOLD........we had to leave by 9:00 o'clock ( I think 9:00, it could have been earlier) as they had other reservations coming in after us !!!!   When I arrived and my friend said.........Hurry, we have to hurry.........we are only given until 9:00. (or whatever)  I was flabbergasted, shocked, outraged, & plain Shell-Shocked !    What ?  I (we) have dined at some of the premier restaurants in Charlotte as well as other Cities , and have NEVER been given a TIME LIMIT......(because they have to \"Turn A Table\" ) !!!!! So.........OK.........salad was already served.  I had not been there for maybe 10 minutes, was looking at the menu and they waiter came to take our order........Others had ordered immediately after they sat down knowing we were on a time limit.......... The food arrived quickly...........and because we were seated in the BACK where there is a big screen TV, a group of about 10-12 came in to watch a BALL GAME.    naturally, they were LOUD....to the point that the waiters apologized to us........damage done.   We could not even hear each other talk to try to have a conversation......PLUS.......we were hurrying as fast as we could.   The waiter asked if anyone wanted coffee & dessert, someone said.\"Do we have time\".......he said \"Oh yes, the other party arrived and we seated them in the dining room.\"   GREAT............and here we were in a SPORTS BAR listening to screaming  and eating like we were on our LUNCH HOUR !       As we were leaving.another waiter seeing what we had gone through apologized and said, please come back, etc.     The waiters were great..........speaking for myself, the food mediocre at best,  Other said their food was \"good\".   Disappointed does not even cover the experience.  And the wonderful food and memories of the old B&B in the past are a fading memory. Speaking for myself, I will not go back.    There are PLENTY of SPORTS BARS in Charlotte! No, I knew I was not going to Morton's...........but, I didn't think I was going to a LOUD Sports Bar where we had a TIME LIMIT on how long we could stay !!!!      So INSULTING !",

If you like a dark, classic feeling environment that plays Sinatra type tunes at a low level, has plenty of intimate booths to sit in, stiff pours, and steaks, you probably can't go wrong here.   The outside bar that is still roofed and has a/c is nice and bright if you prefer a little more lighting and they have big tables for a more family/large group parties.  Unfortunately I did not try a steak, but the meal I did have was pretty good, and will definitely be back to try one.",

    "text": "I wanted to find a place that was a little funky/different for my H's birthday so after searching around I came across this place.  I was thrilled at the idea of an old school steakhouse.     It has taken a couple of days for me to get over the urge to gag when thinking about my experience.  Now let me say that first off the service was terrific, the cocktails were on point.  We also brought a bottle of wine, it is really great that you can byob for a $15 corkage fee.  The shrimp cocktail had very fresh shrimp, good size, good value the sauce has huge kick of horseradish.  YUM!  The French onion soup was delicious with just the right amount or cheese and bread with a very rich flavor. I will definitely go back for the soup.  What was not so great was the steak, I am so very bummed because I liked the old worn-in vibe of this place.  The meat was worse than stew meat.  I ordered the 3 medallions, one has horseradish, one has blue cheese and the third has wine butter sauce.  The meat was not good quality, there was no flavor and there was no sear on it to help with flavor/texture.  My husband had the ribeye, this is where my gag reflex kicks in.  I saw him take a fork of meat from the plate to his mouth and a huge, quivering piece of fat was on the fork no meat.  His face went white, he hadn't seen how bad the piece was because it's very dark in the restaurant.  I did see it though, and started gagging.   He had to slyly spit it into his napkin. He tried a second piece, all gristle I gagged again when I saw that piece.  There was not an edible bite of steak there.  In addition to that, he ordered medium, and the meat was cooked to just a bit over rare.  The creamed spinach was not anything special.    Go here, have a cocktail, have some appetizers but do yourself a favor and don't have steak.  Our tab was $135 for two manhattans, two entrees, two soups and one split appetizer plus $15 for corkage fee so very reasonable for a steakhouse as far as price but honestly the meat quality was terrible.  Blech.      If you want a good steak, this is not the place for you.  :(",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by my recent trip here. Going in I had heard a fair amount of mixed reviews from my friends and colleagues, so I was not sure what to expect.   Walking up you can tell that this place has been here for ever - definitely looks every bit of 60yrs old. On the inside it looks about the same, very old with lost of old pictures on the walls. Our group had a reservation for 830 and we were quickly sat as soon as everyone arrived. Our drink orders were taken shortly after we were seated and the waitress also opened up the bottle of wine that we brought for dinner(they have a $15 per bottle corkage fee). We ordered the large shrimp cocktail to start for the table, which comes with a warning on how hot the cocktail sauce is. Personally, I love a very spicy cocktail sauce which this certainly delivered and then some. For my steak I ordered the Ribeye with blue cheese as well as a Caesar salad and a side of asparagus, both of which come with the steak. My steak was cooked perfectly and tasted good. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals as well. Overall the meal was very enjoyable and for the price its a pretty good deal. I do have to point out that the one area that we all felt was lacking were the drinks from the bar, hence the lost star. We ordered 3 cocktails and two had issues, specifically: old fashioned had chunks of honey? floating in it(appears they use honey vs simple syrup) and the martini with blue cheese olives came with hollowed out olives and no blue cheese(never scene that before)",

    "text": "This is a classic Charlotte place whose time has passed. When I moved here decades ago, this was already old and an institution. It still rests on that laurel. Stripped of its history and reputation, this is average steak (for top prices) in a trailer.  I take out of town guests here from time to time for the historical interest. When I got on Open Table recently to do that, I was shocked to see a note from the restaurant indicating that time was limited to something like an hour and a half for meals. I guess I'm getting old, but the notion of paying $200 for a meal and then getting kicked out after an hour and a half is a bit much. Once I saw that, I decided to book somewhere else and doubt I would return.   At any rate, worth checking out as a memento of what a top steak place was like in Charlotte before there were many other good restaurants here. Your basic steak and iceberg lettuce place. Extra point for the old-timey cheese spread. But now it is really an amusement park or roadside attraction, rather than a great restaurant. It is not what it was, but continues to believe it is.",

This was my husbands 1st time here, he loved the old steakhouse feel, the boys club feel...The price was not bad for two with cocktails. Ive had more expensive meals that were not as delicious or enjoyable. Ok now the the bad: OMG the service was so lousy!!! We had a server seat us that i wish would have stayed with us but no, we got Miss. no where to be found, short, curt and obviously did not want to work that night! We actually would've had more drinks and probably gotten dessert but this woman could not even fill up our water glasses....she was MIA for most of the night! The servers around us actually spoke to their tables and were sweet and fun but this lady obviously did not want to have anything to do with us? Very confusing?  Beef N Bottle is a staple in Charlotte, I've been here many times in my 30 years here, however this by far was the worst experience!  Ill still come back and give it another shot, i just hope i don't get Miss. ray of f@$king sunshine again!",

    "text": "My first experience at Beef n'Bottle was almost perfect.  Truly one of the best steaks that I've ever had...  Here are my tips for first timers:  *Don't snooze on the bread, crackers, melba toast served with cheese spread.   Eat it!!  *Order a salad, they will bring you a plate of greens and a platter for the table to select the veggies that you'd like to put on your salad. Try the thinly sliced radishes, even if you don't usually like them, they are so good.  The veggie platter concept is different but a neat concept.  They make all of their dressings in house.  Trust me, they're great!  I tried the Ranch (very creamy) and balsamic vinaigrette (very tasty).  *Talk to your waiter, ask for their opinion.  They are very knowledgeable about the different types and cuts of meat.  Based on our server's recommendation,  I ordered the Delmonico. (Insert heart emojis here)I ordered my steak medium and it came out perfect in my book.  The steak was one of the most flavorful, juiciest steaks that I have probably EVER eaten. I like this place because their entrees do come with sides and a large onion ring, not like the other fancy steak places that have you order a la carte.  I chose sauteed mushrooms as my side: great choice for me and I will order both again and Again and AGAIN!     Service was very good.  Chip, Our server was personable and efficient.  However, he was spread too thin on the night that we were there, not his fault! We enjoyed speaking to him as he's worked there a long time and clearly enjoys his job and is very proud to be part of the BNB family.   This place is not fancy at all on the inside: think old school and dark and don't be scared away by the exterior either! One of few issues here was that it gets very loud and I believe its because of their low ceilings.  It was borderline uncomfortable towards the end of our meal, I couldn't concentrate on our conversation. Hence the loss of one star.   All in all, Im kicking myself for not coming here sooner.  Im glad the best friend and I came here for my birthday celebration and I cant wait to come back!",

It's has an old Chicago, mafia type feel inside. The service is always top notch. I've never had a bad experience.   Your experience starts with a basket of crackers and this cheese-like spread. Don't judge it, eat it. You're welcome in advance. If you like horseradish, you must order an app that involves their homemade cocktail sauce. So damn good. I usually go with oysters. They are monstrous, huge in size.   You've got to get a steak when you come here, but their shrimp scampi is so ridiculously delicious. Solution: get a combo. And if you don't see one on the lost you like, create your own. I always get the delmonico (all steaks come with an onion ring on top) and shrimp scampi, with a loaded baked potato and salad. The salad is a plate of iceberg lettuce. They bring out a plate of veggies and you can top yours however you want. You're probably thinking, why would I want to get a salad then? Well, it's because they make all their dressings. Stupid good. I go with the blue cheese.  For dessert, warm apple pie and cinnamon ice cream. I don't care how full you are. Also of note, half price wine on Mondays. You can also bring in your own wine for a reasonable corkage fee. However, I recommend starting with a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.",

    "text": "BNB has just officially solidified its spot in my mind as one of the best eating experiences in Charlotte. Heaps above sooooo many others. Do notice though that I said EXPERIENCE. If you are looking for modern uptight decor, an inventive menu, or a cheap dinner, then no, this isn't the place for you. However if you can enjoy an old school, \" if it ain't broke don't fix it\" kind of vibe then you will be in pure heaven here.  Sure the outside looks dated, but perhaps it's because this place has been around since the 50s so yeah...it IS old. I appreciate that they have kept it old school outside as well as in instead of giving in to the current treatment of so many great spaces (see: Doubledoor, Tommys Pub, The Steeple, and the majority of Southend) which is mow it down and build something generic.   The menu is the same way, classic upscale dining straight out of your Grandmas first cookbook on how to entertain for guests, complete with melba toasts, oysters rockefeller and one of the best darn martinis I've ever had. The steaks are king here however, perfectly seasoned to the perfect temp and unlike most steakhouses that cost this much for an a la carte steak, the ones at BNB come with a salad AND a side. The salad is served as a plate of lettuce per person and a plate full of veggies to go on top. Everyone can customize their salad to their liking and might leave a few extra veggies for dipping in the delicious homemade dressings. When it comes to the sides don't miss the creamed spinach, it is sooo good.   Not only is the food and atmosphere awesome here, the service is top notch as well. Personable and real without coming across as trying too hard, our waitress was once of the best I have had in a very long time. Just attentive enough without hovering, it was just the kind of service I look for in fine dining. She really went above and beyond and knew her stuff.  As long as you know what you are getting into (and are excited about that) you will adore this place. So throw on your best vintage dress (or suit) and enjoy a meal out like in the good ol' days.",

My family dined at the Beef n Bottle last night to celebrate a birthday. It was everything a revered steakhouse should be: the ambiance was vintage; the wait staff very informed, helpful and efficient; the steaks and seafood entrees were prepared and served perfectly. In observing other diners it was not difficult to surmise that this restaurant was a cherished destination for many others. I cannot wait to go again. Be sure to make a reservation if you want to be certain to be seated.",

I had their 10 oz filet and I can't say it was any better than a outback if not outback was better.  my wife had salmon which she said was not fresh. btw, she was born and raised on an island in the Philippines.  my friend had the sea scallops and shrimp mix. both not fresh at all and half left.  my other friend had the frog leg dinner which they claim to famous for, I tasted it and almost threw up. that one we had taken off the bill.  the deserts are 100% garbage as well, I cannot put my fingers on it but it seems like they buy frozen stuff from someplace.  now here is the part that gets me . we walked in on a Monday and it's packed! why?! it's terrible and expensive to boot. I did notice most people were not from North Carolina, and it seemed to be business trips so perhaps it's near their hotel and they are not paying and don't care? very few locals.   anyway beware it's horrible",

    "text": "This place continues to underwhelm. Yet, I continue to be forced to go here with family (party of 6, 9, and 7 respectively) who like it for some reason. This was my last time. This is a detailed review not for the faint of heart. Continue at your own risk. Overall points of interest are toward the end.  The Ugly Truth about my last THREE visits: Three visits in a row my order has been messed up. The last two I ended taking an undercooked steak home in a box because the kitchen can't manage to cook a medium rare OR a medium steak properly. How hard is that to do? 4 steak in two visits, first two were ordered medium but presented burnt/charred at Well Done level then replaced with RARE ones which I took home and cooked properly later. Each of the last 3 visits I ended up filling up on apps, sides, and a couple bites of desert. I've tried different cuts (Filet and Ribeye) but it made no difference. I always order my steaks from here with seasoning added because they are extremely bland if you do not.  Overall:  APPEARANCE/AMBIANCE - D- Restaurant looks like a hole in the wall from the exterior and the layout of the interior isn't much better. It's always EXTREMELY loud inside because it's a small restaurant. Back patio is a little better than the front. I would NOT take a date here expecting a quiet romantic evening. SERVICE - A -  has always been excellent, friendly, knowledgeable and timely. Table is pre-bussed, food arrives neatly and timely, tempo is always nearly perfect. FOOD QUALITY/TASTE - C Appetizers are good quality and taste great but I believe are overpriced. We love the shrimp cocktail but it's on the expensive side. Salads and dressing are very nominal. I've had better at lesser places. Steaks are good quality but bland unless you order it seasoned... Then pray it's cooked properly. Lobster was overcooked and rubbery Deserts are all excellent. Haven't had one I didn't like. But by the time I've gotten to this point on each of the last 3 visits my meal has been ruined. KITCHEN - F - details are posted above. 3 visits in a row with something on my order not cooked properly. NOT acceptable anywhere. COST- overpriced for what this place is. They should invest some money in kitchen help and COMPLETE renovation.  Personally, I would save your money and go to Longhorn, Texas Roadhouse, etc or spend a little more and go to any one of the big chains (Ruth's Kris, Mortens, etc) Hope this helps someone decide where (or where not) to go for dinner.",

We both spied the building at the same time and just gave each other that look.     That look that married couples give each other that says \"What the Hell  was that?\" and \"Let's turn around\" simultaneously.  Turns out it's an old school surf and turf joint from 1958.  We were 45 mins ahead of dinner hour so we scored a table.  Hey. you know this kind of joint.  Walls covered with black and white prints of  movie stars from the 40's and onward.  Frankie,  Sammy, and Dino right there with Rita Hayworth and  even Liberace.  Lights down low and piped in tunes from the rat pack and anything 50's.  Started with a Manhattan which I have to say was fabulous.  We both opted for seafood platters.  Look, maybe the steaks are great,  I don't know.  The seafood was similar to Calabash style and was very good.  Places like this have been doing it forever and they've got their bread and butter dishes down pat.  Our server Seth .... well Seth abides. nuff said.  Long and short, foodies may find the place lacking.   Seafood was spot on and I'm guessing steaks are too.   No haute cuisine but hey, fuhgetabouttit.  Food is good enough and the atmosphere just  added ten points to my testosterone level just for sitting there.   Didn't see Joe Pesci  in a corner booth but maybe next time.  Bill for two with wine and cocktails $91 before tip.",

Good service.  Nothing earth shattering.  Glad I finally went.  I was hoping it'd be a little classier in terms of the clientele's manner of dress.  We had on coats and ties, and there were old Baby Boomers in shorts at the next table.  (Oh, well.  I don't expect much from that generation except constant disappointment and amazement at their complete lack of regard for the rest of the world, but I digress...)  Bottom line: for this much money, I'd rather go somewhere else.  Been there once and am happy I did, since it's a Charlotte institution (and we don't have a lot of those).

The wait staff was terrific and friendly, they squeezed us in at 9pm, no questions asked, the petite filet was moist and delicious and perfectly cooked, and the stead fries were crispy and fantastic.  The prices were reasonable, and we had a wonderful (and quiet, and better lit) dinner.

The food was incredible for a fine dining restaurant with a set back in time. Black and white photos cover the walls inside the dimly lit atmosphere. The music was a turn off for me and sounded more like a soda shop than a an elegant experience. Service was fantastic. Most importantly is the food. My boyfriend and I ordered the prime rib, mash potatoes, and a salad. Cooked to perfection and leftovers are always a pleasure.

    "text": "Well, here we go, I am going to state my opinion of Beef and Bottle. Who asked you ?? You ask..Me  and if there is any more people out there like me who have been driving by this well know institution on South Blvd for 8 years now. About 5 months ago there was the \"Living Social \" for this very restaurant! I was scared but excited to try this place which looks like an industrial construction building but so many people on Face book had raved about  and said buy  the Living Social  for this treat! We arrived with a reservation tonight, a Tuesday, it was packed! The place is exactly as described in the prior reviews...its a time warp its stuck in the 1960's , not a bad place to be --kind of cross between my Dads old Basement office and a run down previously fancy supper club.  We did sit for quite a while before anyone approached our table. Our waitress was friendly and took our drink orders and informed us of the specials this evening. We had 5 people in our party. We ordered a varied amount of the specialty items (steaks) off the menu. The salad , which is served plain is accompanied by a nice tray of fresh vegetable and very good homemade salad dressing. It was a long stretch of time though between our drinks and our salad. Next the steaks arrived..My husband had the 6 oz filet...medium rare, My daughter the Ribeye, rare, my daughters fiance had the Sirloin well done and our other friend had the Shrimp Scampi. I ordered the 30.00 New York Strip, encrusted with Horseradish sauce.-----RARE. Well ,my steak was medium at least..if not to the well done side. I cut it in half right away, to stop the cooking process..it was about 15-20 minutes until the waitress came back around to ask how everything was when I informed her of the doneness of my steak. She took it back and said she would have a new for me. Everyone continued to eat at my insistence..although I didnt think that a RARE steak would take too long. Well 25 minutes later my steak came out...I immediately cut into it --starving and salivating! Medium----AGAIN...The owner came up behind me and said..how is your steak I was told it was to well done the first time...He looked down and said...Uh Oh ..this is not RARE..And he picked it up and said it would be replaced and I would not be charged. Another 20 minutes went by..the steak that came back was okay ..medium rare and small and very very grisily I ate about a third of it and it had to spit out four mouthfuls because I could not chew it. The creamed spinach that I got with it was not good..it was cold when I received it and the flavor was not creamy or good. The steak was taken off my check..but for a place named \"BEEF AND BOTTLE\" I think this was a Faux Pas! I will not be returning and now when I pass this weird little place on South Blvd I will be glad I am not wondering anymore.....",

    "text": "I went here one night when I was craving a good steak and I didn't feel like going to Sullivan's.  I had passed it for the last 10 years and never been in and now I'm upset I didn't go sooner.  You walk in and you expect to see Cary Grant or Fran Sinatra sitting at a table in the corner.  It's dim lights and great Rat Pack music from the 40's.  Friendly service and a great old school atmosphere.        We started off with a french onion soup.  Not fancy but very tasty.  The food here is the center point of the dining experience.  No frills just good quality food.  The salads came and I loved it.  They serve you a pate of lettuce with the dressings and veggies on the side so you can put on your salad what you like.  Great concept.  Great Blue cheese dressing.      I had the NY Strip rare and it rocked.  Best steak I have had in Charlotte.  The thing I love is when you order rare here it really is rare.  Not Medium or medium-well like some other place that serve you a steak  on a hot sizzling plate and charge high prices for crap food.  Perfectly cooked here at the Beef and Bottle.  My friend got the Prime Rib medium rare.  It just melted in your mouth.  I also had the backed sweet potato that was awesome.  My friend had the onion rings.  They are the bomb.  Most of the steaks come with an onion ring on top.  Thy bread is toasted and buttered french bread.  So good.      Also there is another review on here that talks about the orange butter that is hard and sticky.  To my surprise it's not butter it's cheddar cheese spread.  It's on all the tables with crackers to nibble on while you wait on your food.  I guess some people need to get out more.  Cheese is not butter.  This place serves real butter if you ask for butter.  All ingredients are high quality.  A hidden gem in Charlotte.  I will be back as often.  This place rocks...",

They brought a plate of lettuce with a side of vegetables and a pot of dressing.  This was unnecessarily complex.  I could understand if they brought an array of exotic veggies that people wouldn't like, but it was staples like cucumber, onion and peppers.  The Ribeye steak was well cooked but non nondescript.  Half price wine night was the highlight, and the only reason it got 3 stars. Better than an OutBack, worse than a prime steakhouse.",

From the trashy red haired lady at the host stand, to the highly rude and unprofessional staff I can't decide what was worse. I was rushed out of their so quickly it was unbelievable. The waitress, which was an older blonde lady, what she didn't know could fill a book. To cap it all off, this older guy who I'm led to believe was the manager, an old bald guy basically told me I had to hurry up. Rudeness personified. The salads were rotten and the way it's presented is so redneck trash. Brings out a plate of rotten lettuce and vegetables, the veggies were from another table because it still had dressing on it which means they re-use them which is absolutely disgusting. What if that person was sick?  They don't care at Beef N Bottle. The quality of steak is really low BTW, barely choice. Really tough and full of gristle. Low low quality restaurant. Will never go back.",

    "text": "Truly looks like a strip club from the street. Would never have walked in to the place were it not for Yelp.   The experience is a bit schizoid. You enter through the rear parking lot into an atrium and then pass through down a step in to a dark dining area. Our greeter looked approximately 16 and didn't quite fit in the overall club-y vibe they seem to be going for.  Similarly schiz-y were the customers who were dressed in date nite dinner-out clothes as well as shorts and t-shirts. I am not sure who the target market is as there were small kids around, which seemed out-of-place, as well as middle-aged couples who were clearly regulars.  Food is steakhouse circa 1972. Dishes are straight up what-you-see-is-what-you-get. What they do, they do well but there are absolutely no surprises.  Steak or shrimp, salad, potatoes and some kind of side veggie.  Didn't try the desserts as we were stuffed from the meal.Overall service was pleasant and well-modulated.  Not sure if this is a place to take a date as it is solid, but not stellar.",

Makes you wonder what people are hiding when it is 'that' dark. I think overall the place is hit or miss. The last time we went the food was exceptional. The recent time. Just eh.

The front dining room was completely full so I was seated in the \"atrium.\"  The atrium reminds me of an old windowed-in porch we used to have in my family's lakehouse when I was a kid - it was very casual and luckily air conditioned.  The service was attentive but not overbearing and the food was fantastic.  It wasn't fancy by any stretch of the imagination, but the food was top-notch.  I had the Ribeye, medium-rare and a baked sweet potato on the side, served with a generous dallop of cinnamon-sugar butter.  I could feel my arteries hardening - and it was a fantastic meal.  This place may not be on the caliber of a Mortons or a Ruth's Chris from a service and ambiance perspective, but wow the food was good.  Big thumbs up!",

My waitress barely described the specials let alone tell me something else and I had already ordered the Caesar salad.

Based on the wood paneling and framed, yellowed photos of such greats as Neil Diamond, Frank Sinatra and, who is that? Bert Convy?, the Beef and Bottle was settled and collecting dust when Old School was in kindergarten. Sure, it's not exactly SWANK (the piano bar seems more converted trailer/walled in patio than anything), but I'm not exactly a swank cat. I tend to travel the other side of the tracks. (And by \"other side,\" I mean the underneath.) To wit, I thought the strange rear entrance, the presence of barbed wire and, yes, the wood paneling, actually were POSITIVES rather than negatives.  The food? Tasty. Not too expensive. Actually the steaks were priced around those of Longhorn and Outback rather than a Ruth Chris. However, the sear and crust on my ribeye were superior to those chain joints, so point goes to B&B. The meat was cooked to spec, medium rare. Sure, the most nouvelle the menu gets is the presence of shrimp, but hey, sometimes the occasion calls for a salad of iceberg lettuce and gloppy ranch dressing. That last sentence sounds insulting, but I assure you aspiring Foodie Douches, it is not. I meant it with great sincerity.  In fact, the only thing I found to gripe about was the intensely low lighting made the menu difficult to read though, I'm sure, it makes your date much more attractive. I'll give Beef and Bottle a solid 4 stars. I think I'll be coming back when I return to town.",

    "text": "Unique, and worth visiting.   My suggestion: Make a reservation for the dining room, yet go early to have a drink in the bar.  The bar area is reminiscent of an addition to your grandparents' house. What is this structure? Fascinating. The drinks are stiff, and the bar itself can accommodate perhaps 8 people.  Service was quality. On a busy holiday night, Diane was both acting bartender and acting server. She was calm, professional, and informative. She made no excuses and enhanced my experience.  Appetizers: Crackers and cheese spread are on the table - and not unlike the snack-size cheese & crackers with the red plastic stick you may have had as a child. Shrimp cocktail with the Two Napkin Cocktail Sauce (\"one for your mouth, one for your brow\") is a multi-level experiential item served in a silver holder. It requires some muscle to free your shrimp.   Steaks: I can vouch for both the NY Strip steak and the Filet Mignon. Delicious, cooked to order, and above all, left me feeling great afterwards. Ruth's, the Palm, Del's, etc. all tend to make me want to lie down when I am finished.  Salad: This is a neat experience with a nice touch. All entrees come with a choice of Caesar or Traditional salad.  For the traditional salad (I've never ordered their Caesar), you get lettuce on a plate along with a tray featuring radishes, cucumbers, tomatoes, celery, and onions. You get to build your own salad.   I've not had any sides that surprised me - positive or negative.  Men's Bathroom: The decor is striking and from decades past. Bold uniform tile, in-wall toilet paper holder, mood lighting, and the lack of a sink. Yet there's a color poster of Marilyn Monroe from the 1990's with the \"Marilyn Monroe (TM)\" in cursive. A black & white 8x10 of Ms. Monroe seems more befitting.  When I asked the managerial-looking gentleman in the red shirt about this, he said \"EBay.\"   I am unsure if that answered my question.",

The make your own salad, home made Italian and blue cheese dressing is so good. Its nice to go to a steakhouse where a salad and side is included with entree.  B & B is a little place that reminds you of a scene from Goodfellas. Definitely a old school staple in Charlotte.",

    "text": "This was our forth or fifth time eating at beef and bottle. Our first visit was amazing but with each visit after it has declined. The first time or two we thought it was a bad night and understood because we both had been in the service industry years ago. But tonight took the absolute cake for worst dining experience ever. Let me start by saying we saw a large table that had arrived 15-20 minutes after us get their food before us. We had been sitting there over an hour when our food finally came after we  finally said something to our server. The servers response when we asked her if they had forgotten about us was \"no, you just came at our busiest time.\" It was like she was blaming us for their mistakes. We had reservations. She was just rude. Our salads were served long before the table beside us but their salads were cleared long before ours and it wasn't because we had not finished our salads before them. I ordered my filet med only to get it burnt on the outside. It had such a horrible after taste that I only ate 2 bites and told the server to just take it back. There was no way I was going to have my food ruined again. I ate maybe 4 bites of my baked potato that was very flavorless. I'm not sure if it was the Caesar salad or the blue cheese crumbles that my fiance had tonight but he woke up in the middle of the night sick to his stomach and belching which is an indication of food poisoning. I had lost my appetite and wasn't hungry when we left but later woke up hungry and made myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I'm now waiting to see if my 6 year old wakes up sick to know if it was the Caesar salad or not. Btw they don't normally serve bread but if they do (which they did tonight) then you know that your food has taken extremely too long to serve.",

Back to the review: Don't judge a book by its cover or in this case don't judge a restaurant by it's exterior design - which can be said for Beef 'N Bottle. This restaurants old fashion and traditional building holds inside one of the best tasting steaks I have eaten in a long time.  I can see why it is a Charlottes award winning steak restaurant.   I ordered the NY Strip, medium cooked, along with a side of cheese broccoli. The meal comes with a salad; only the slices of veggie comes on a platter for you to choose from.  The restaurant was slightly dark and tight, which added to the ambiance.  Our waiter was energetic and did an excellent job breaking down the menu.   I enjoyed myself.",

    "text": "I came to Charlotte for the farthest thing from a good time.  My Sister Nancy has 2 BrainTumors and I'm out here to be with her and help my Mom to care for her.  Last Thursday evening I Googled Best Steakhouses in Charlotte and this \" Hole in the Wall\" place called the Beef 'n Bottle came up on top of one of these lists.  I called my Niece Sara and asked her and her Husband Jon if they had heard of it which he had so we decided to check it out.  What a fantastic decision it was.  You can go to Ruth's Chris, Morton's or Flemings for the same experience pretty much every time. It's always good but always the same.  Every once in a while you will find a place like Beef 'n Bottle where time seems to have stood still.  We went on Sunday evening so it wasn't crowded as we needed a break from the stress of my Sister's condition  We were seated immediately upon arrival at The Doris Day Table which is one of there most popular we were told.    Our Server Hilary with one \"L\" was also our Bartender.  She started us off with a rundown on how things worked there and gave us some of the History of the place.  I had a fantastic Makers Mark Manhattan Up and Jon had an Old Fashioned.  Then came the Apps.  I had their Oysters Rockefeller and Jon and Sara had the Scampi and a Spread if some sort that was Delicious.  Sara had the Filet Medium Rare and Jon & I each had their Beautifully Marbled Ribeye cooked to a perfect Medium Rare to Medium which paired up perfectly with a 2011 Hess 19 Block Howell Mountain Cuvee Meritage.  Hilary tended to us and gave this West Coast Yankee a taste of True Southern Hospitality.  Rick Bouman one of the Managing Partners came over near the end of our dining experience for a visit as well.    We ended up taking some leftovers home as the fairly priced large Portions were more than enough for us along with a piece of their Famous Key Lime Pie.  If you want a Memorable Dining Experience that you won't find everywhere, please try out George Fine's Beef 'n Bottle.  Tell them that Bill sent you.  You'll be glad you did.  I know that on my next trip out to be with my Sister again where I'll be having Dinner at least one night.  Thank you for the \"Fine\" (pun intended) evening Hilary, Rick, and I hate to say I'be forgotten our Young Busman's name once again.  See you again soon.  Cheers!   Bill",

We've been several times and it's always a great experience with excellent food and well worth the $50+ per person.  Last night we went for my fathers birthday.  Our party was 9, we were seated at a folding table (yes a literal folding table) with my father sitting in the main aisle of the room we were in.  The restaurant is small and has always been a little tight, which previously was just part of the charm.  But last night was too much.  It was like being in coach on an airplane.  We were packed in so tight with the tables next to us that the waitress couldn't even get to all of us.  My father had people's asses and serving trays right next to and over his head the entire night. It seems like with the seating and the table time limits that they're trying to squeeze more blood from a stone and maybe it's just how things have to be. We'll think twice about our next trip and definitely make sure ahead of time that our seating isn't going to weird.",

The shrimp were massive. I ordered the black and bleu ribeye cooked to perfection and just the right amount of Cajun rub and bleu cheese.

We booked a 6pm reservation and all arrived on time. We ordered many drinks and bottles of wine, several apps and were having fun. Then everyone ordered entrees which were good but clearly coming out of a rushed kitchen (sides were hot, steaks were not). No one complained. At 7:55 we were ordering another round of drinks but were told we could not because the next reservation (8pm) for our table had arrived. We could not order any more drinks nor could we even fathom having dessert. It was time to go, here's your check, please leave. Mind you, the servers were not at fault. The manager (owner?) said a \"2-hour experience\" is a typical reservation for the holidays. End of story. So, several hundreds of dollars later we left and bid Beef & Bottle farewell. Forever.",

    "text": "This place looks kind of like a little hole-in-the-wall when you drive by it ... and you might think to yourself \"how is this one of the best rated steak houses in America?\". Well, I can tell you after last night that it .... it just is. Every single person I've spoken to about Beef n Bottle has done nothing but reassured my anticipation for this meal. My suggest ... make a reservation in advance (Open Table points chicka-chicka-yeah) because this place is TINY inside.   Started off with pinot noir ... the servers here are also the bartenders ... and they have a heavy hand. Huge pours = happy wife = happy life. Now to the food ... my wife got a salad to start, followed by her entree of Filet  + Salmon with the mashed potatoes as a side. Salad was cool, since they bring everything on the side and you essentially build your own ... but it was just that, a salad. Nothing special about it, except the dressing. All of the dressing are homemade, and they're on point! Her filet + salmon was \"amazing, and perfection\" in her words. The salmon has this awesome bourbon glaze to it, and the filet --- well, it cut like butter. The mashed potatoes ... WOWZA were they good. Said the only steak that she's out (at a restaurant) was the original Omaha Steak House in Omaha, because well ... Omaha. I opted for the French Onion in lieu of  the salad (a $2 upcharge) and I would say it was worth all 200 pennies. Not too salty ... just cheesy enough. Pretty darn good. I got the Filet + Scallops with mashed potatoes (added bacon + cheese to mine for $2 upcharge ... again worth all 40 nickels). The scampi style scallops had an incredible garlicy/herby/lemony flavor thanks to the sauce it was surrounded by. I may have dipped a few pieces of my perfectly cooked medium-rare filet in it for an extra flavor boost.  After all there, there was just no room for dessert. BUT, what we saw on other's tables looked very delicious.  Long story long ... this is one of the best damn values of any steakhouse you'll ever find. period. Here, $42 gets you a salad, filet  + salmon, and a side. Try any other big box chain steak house and $42 will get you a piece of meat (if you're lucky) sans any sides. If you just want to come here for a \"normal\" night out ... you can get pasta for $15-$16, salmon by itself (but with salad and sides, of course) for $24 ... nothing that would \"break the bank\" per se. Do yourself a favor and grab your spouse/significant other/bootycall and get yo self over here right now to try this Charlotte landmark.",

    "text": "Oh my goodness! Where do I begin.   We came here last night for my birthday dinner (middle of the week birthdays suck btw lol) and boy was I impressed. Before I even get into details, I've driven past this place numerous times and never realized it was even there. It's truly a little hidden gem. You will miss it if you focus on all the sketchy looking places you're driving past.  Now as we drove down south blvd and away from uptown...my hopes of eating a good steak started to diminish. When we turned into the beef & bottle I almost didn't know what to think or feel. From the outside it looks an old cowboy hang out spot. You walk in and it's like your back in the 1950's. The lighting is dim and the walls are covered with photos of old school artists and musicians.   Fast forward a little bit...to the food. We started with French onion soup - it was delicious. We each ordered our entree - I like how they automatically come with a salad and a side (this will run you $10-$15 in other high end steakhouses). You get a plate of lettuce with all your other salad items on a little side platter. You get to basically build your own salad the way you like it. Oh, easy on the tomatoes? No problem - don't add them in lol.  The STEAK - I had the rib eye. Words cant even begin to descried how perfect it was. Perfect cut of meat, perfectly cooked...just PERFECT! I was very hesitant at first but I also added a lobster tail to my entree for $19. That may sound expensive for a lobster tail but I wouldn't hesitate to order it again the next time. The lobster tail was HUGEEEEE. I hate mentioning other restaurants while writing reviews...however, I ordered some sort of truffle shruffle mumbo jumbo lobster tail at Flemmings when I ate there the other week and the darn thing was around $14, 1/3 of the size and no where as good as the one I had last night. We shared a bottle of wine throughout dinner and a desert after our meal. (The lesson here: GET THE LOBSTER TAIL!)  The Service: We were seated as soon as we got there (reservation) and our server was awesome. Constantly checking in to make sure everything was ok.  Long story LONGGGG, Beef & Bottle gets two thumbs up from me. I'm already planning on when I can go back. Don't let the 3.5 stars or $$$ scare you away. Give it a try, it's worth every penny you spend. I'm certain you will enjoy this place!",

    "text": "Beef and Bottle is fine. The fella and I have been a few times, and we stopped in for our latest visit on a Saturday night around 5:30 p.m. There was a sign on the door saying the only tables available before 9:00 p.m. were for reservation holders, but we took a chance. Thankfully, the high-top tables in the bar were available (there are four 2-tops), along with the seats at the bar. Since we were so early, we had our pick of tables, but they were full by the time we left.  The bartender was our waitress, and she was fairly attentive. The fella wanted some bottled water, but they didn't have any; the waiter said they used to have it, but they don't anymore.   We snacked on the complimentary crackers and cheddar spread til our appetizer arrived. We got the crab dip with pita points, and it was steaming hot and cheesy and gooey. For dinner, I got the chicken breast with rice and broccoli. The chicken had a great seasoning to it, and the broccoli was buttery and tender. The rice was, well, rice. The fella got a Delmonico-cut steak with steak fries and a salad. He thought the steak was really good and definitely had that 1970s feel - a little thinner than steaks these days and not quite as rare as he would have liked, but still good.   I was in the mood for a dessert, so the fella asked about a port... they don't have any. A steakhouse without a port list? Bizarre. So, we (sadly) skipped the dessert and after-dinner drink.  I can't put my finger on what was different about this trip, but Beef & Bottle has lost a little somethin' for me.",

I highly recommend you make one. We had to wait about 15 min even w/a reservation (we totally didn't mind. It was fine). The service is top notch. The servers are extremely knowledgeable about the menu and in making suggestions. My husband ordered a porter house steak and he said it was EXCELLENT. I had a seafood platter and it was PERFECT. We also had an amazing key lime pie for dessert (which we brought home bc we were so stuffed) and it was to die for!!!!   The atmosphere in the restaurant is energizing. from the outside (and even the inside) the restaurant doesn't look like much but man the food here is amazing! I love that you don't have to dress up here but while you're there you feel ilke you're on an intimate date. the lighting is perfect.   The food must be good bc I saw several people dining alone which I think is pretty awesome.  Overall I'd come back in a heartbeat! Cant' wait to bring friends there.",

The \"bread\" is refrigerated pub cheese served with saltines and club crackers. I honestly thought it was a joke. As a party of 8 we had two servers. While the elder one was nice, the younger one was cocky and acted as though he was too good to wait on us. The apps and salads were sub par at best. They royally screwed up every steak we got. Every steak was cooked incorrectly and several of us had to trade plates. I had the new York strip and it was much fattier than expected.   Between the condescending service and the mediocre food, I was extremely let down. Word of advice, go to another steakhouse.",

    "text": "I'll just say - I was not impressed, even a little.  I knew prior to going that it would be a \"hole in the wall\" place, just given the other reviews, but I didn't expect to eat in what appeared to be a \"trailer\" add on addition and pay over 100$ for two people. The steak and shrimp were very tasty, however the fish, and all the veggies were not. Specifically we had the broccoli, and asparagus, neither of which were more delectable than a steam fresh bag from my microwave. No seasoning, just bleh. We ended up dipping both in the shrimp scampi sauce to help a little with the flavor.   The other thing that really raked my nerves is that I put a reservation in over a week in advance, and per a friends suggestions - requested a booth (I mean this is a romantic date after all). Once we got there we were told \"there are no booths available\", and I said, I made this reservation over a week ago and your telling me you couldn't save a booth? The older gentlemen said I would of had to made them weeks if not months in advance to get a booth. OK then. How about you call me, or shoot me an email with this information prior to my arrival? We ended up sitting at a tiny table for two that wasn't even big enough to really hold all of our dinner without shifting other items around.  All in all I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you really want to feel like your paying for high quality food all the while eating at a waffle house. You can get the same quality steak from a number of places in Charlotte, and actually feel like its money well spent.",

    "text": "Great food, horrible service.   Yesterday was my birthday and I was so excited about trying this place out with friends.  There were 12 of us, total.  When we got there, our table was ready (yay!)  From there, everything went downhill.   We had the rudest servers I have EVER had.  First, our orders were delivered to the wrong people.  Being that we all got steak, we didn't realize we had the wrong order until we cut into it and had a bite.  The servers came around maybe once every 7 minutes, so I had to wait quite awhile to tell our server that my steak was rare (it was supposed to be medium well).  When they brought the steak back (and it was still a bloody medium and not a medium well), I asked for a fork (since it was taken from my plate before).  The lady pointed to a dirty fork on a salad plate (not my salad plate), and said, \"there's a fork right there, Hun\".  I wish I was making this up.   Furthermore, since we all got the wrong orders, my friend was holding up some fries and asking if they were anyone's fries.  Our male server actually scolded him and said, \"Don't shout out like that--you're making it more confusing\"  For the final straw, I handed the female waitress my check with my credit card, and she said, \"I can't take that right now\" and walked away.  I heard her say something about neglecting other tables.     I served for EIGHT years, and unbeknownst to these rude servers, I sometimes tip 40%.  I understand being in the weeds and being super busy, but being rude is unacceptable.  It IS acceptable to say, \"Oh gosh!  I'm super busy and I'll pick up your checks on my way back during my next trip out here\".  It WOULD be acceptable to mess up orders...people make mistakes.  What is NOT okay is being blatantly rude about the mistakes you brought upon yourself.  They were actually mean!!!!     I left  with $50 less having only eaten a baked potato.  I will not be coming back.",

    "text": "I think my favorite story about Beef 'n Bottle is a few years back when P Diddy tried to rent out the whole restaurant. The owners wouldn't have it because they don't rent out the entire place as it would be an inconvenience to the regulars who sit at the same booths with the same servers every week.   This place is Old Charlotte at its best.   The steaks are massive and perfectly cooked. Beef 'N Bottle's six-ounce filet mignon ($34) is the most popular steak on the menu. I get the 10-ounce filet ($43) because that's how I roll. It comes with a classic iceberg lettuce salad and a side (I do a baked potato).  The last time I was here, I had half a dozen oysters which were the biggest oysters I have ever seen. The (spicy!) cocktail sauce is house made and I'd like to buy a bottle for my house.   One note: Beef 'n Bottle is an old school steakhouse that in many ways is right out of the 60s. If you're expecting a Del Frisco's experience, you'll be disappointed--but you'd also be missing the point of coming here.",

    "text": "My husband and I came out here on Monday for dinner with a group of fabulous fellow yelpers.  Beef N' Bottle is a bit of a shack looking place off of South Blvd. Many people (including myself) have driven past it many many times without even noticing it. There is a decent parking lot in the back. However, it was fairly full for a Monday night dinner....excellent sign!   There was half off bottles of wine. Yes, please! We ordered the Zinfandel, which was excellent. They have this cheese dip thing with crackers on the table as a little complimentary app. I couldn't stop eating this stuff. Though I also named my goldfish, Queso, so my love for anything cheese runs real deep.   My husband and I split a cup of the French onion soup as a -tizer. Oh my gosh yumminess. The cheese was perfectly melted on top. It was super delish. I also had a bite of the crap dip -tizer that another at the table order. Lots and lots of crab meat in that. A few people in the group got some oysters....those things were ginormous!    All the meals come with a make your own salad (like literally you assemble you own...great concept). I had the ranch dressing on mine and it was perfection. All the dressings are homemade, so you can't go wrong.   I ordered the filet medallions (three of them) with potatoes (add bacon and cheese on top....yes, I did that). My husband got the Delmonico (14 oz ribeye) with onion rings. Note: We found out that all the steaks have an onion ring sitting on top...score! The steaks were absolutely perfect. My filet could have been cut with a fork.  A few at the table ordered desserts. I had a bite of my husbands French silk pie. However, the apple pie with cinnamon ice cream looked like a dessert winner!  Amazing food and company! Excellent night!",

I don't get the high reviews, except that the servers couldn't be nicer. It's totally old school, tacky paper sign on the door saying hats not welcome. I agree to that, but a paper sign explaining dress code? I felt I could be in a fire trap...old plugs, old lights, and more. It was hot and cramped in the tiny, dirty back room where we were seated. Room was dusty, with crackers on floor, old unplugged cords laying on floor, water damaged acoustic ceiling tile with gapping hole and cord going through gap. Decor was probably 60 years old too nd creepy. Weird fake cheese spread with packs of wrapped crackers were served. The \"famous salad\" is gross old cut up iceberg, with a tray of slices of too big radishes, old chopped celery, pepper and onion slices that restaurant is so proud of. Then they bring a rickety multi-container of homemade salad dressing, the only tasty thing. Then the not so great cut of over salted meat came on old dishes with inserts that kept moving/coming apart as you cut.  Watery creamed spinach was over salted as well. Husband had a grisly New York Strip, and cold onion rings. Others had overlooked combo steak dish. I think people who like this place are stuck in the olden days, and have no clue what good food is. I just don't get it.",

    "text": "I hate writing bad reviews, I really do, but this experience definitely is deserving! We planned a surprise 60th  birthday dinner for my mom's and they totally ruined the night.   I had to call a couple times and leave a message to make reservations as they are not on Open Table, heard back from a staff member and was informed there were no available seats in the main dinning room for 5 nor at the time we wanted so we make reservations for earlier.   When we got there, the restaurant was relatively empty and we were promptly seated in the atrium dinning room. We had to wait about 10 minutes before our server even came to our table (umm okay, whatever maybe she wasn't notified she got a table?) So we order our meals, ate our tasty salads with made in house dressings. After a long while we get our meals. My husband medium rare rib eye was way over cooked. We are ones to send back food but when you go to a steak house and pay $40 for a steak.. you expect for it to be right.  So he mentions it to the server, she took it back.  After the rest of us were almost done with our meals, she finally brings back a new rib eye.   This one was cooked better but the cut of meat didn't seem like a rib eye. The server even commented on how the beef looked too lean to be a rib eye. The server later comes back and said she asked the cook and they told her it IS actually a rib eye but just from the leaner part of the beef. So basically they gave him a crappy $40 cut of beef.  He eats about a 1/3 of it as it is tough and not very tasty.   We are really to go home at this point.... after telling the server before we ordered that we would need 2 separate check she brings only one (okay maybe she forgot?) then 10 minutes later she unapologetically comes back and had charged us for something we didn't get, another 15 minutes pass and she finally brings the correct checks back but we notice she has added in a mandatory 20% tip on tables 5 or more (are you kidding me?!?! this was the worse server I have had in a long time.. and I am not one to give bad tips as I worked as a server for many years in college). It takes about 15 minutes or so to get our checks back... remember the restaurant was not busy!   At this point we were REALLY disappointed, we had come here to have a fun, delicious meal and celebrate my mom's birthday but we ended up feeling like we WAY overpaid for bad service and not a good meal. As we were finallllly able to leave we decided to talk to the manager and let him know as this USED to be a \"special occasion\" restaurant for us.  To our surprise the manager was aware of the steak being wrong and made us feel like we were wrong. He said \"it was medium well though right?\" Our response, \"But we ordered it medium rare....\" , and he was aware it was celebratory dinner (not a single happy birthday from the staff). After making us feel like he really didn't care if we were satisfied or not he finally offered to give us a gift card to come back.. we told him no, thanks. We weren't looking to get something for free, just wanted to inform him of our experience as we had been there in the past an had a good dinner.  Needless to say.... we won't be back....",

We did have reservations but had to wait 20 minutes or so anyway but no problem we moseyed on to the bar. They had one local beer but the bartender told us one price then served me the drink and then oops it suddenly was pricier....oh well, anyway she was very nice despite the blunder.  We finally sat down and got to the good stuff. Mass amounts of food. I did not care for the packaged crackers. I say skip the darn things no one want to eat saltines at a steak-house restaurant. The cheese dip was one of my bf's favorite parts of the meal. Salad was good - I liked the fresh veggies and my dressing was homemade and yummy. I had the 9oz filet which was mammoth - but was cooked rare to my liking and served with a plethora of button mushrooms and mashed potatoes. I liked my meal but actually felt that the steak could have been seasoned just a tad bit more (which means a lot coming from me the leader of the anti-salt coalition). I had a nice Malbec which was poured sky high to my pleasant surprise!  My boyfriends rib-eye was so-so and he felt he could have made something even better at home. I agreed and thought the filet was the much better choice of the two.   Our server was extremely smiley and friendly. It was busy in there so bring your appetite and some patience. Reservations are highly recommended.   We were stuffed to the brim , but Charlotte has a lot of steak-houses so I'd explore more of those before I went back again.",

    "text": "I hate giving just average reviews, but I think this really was a 2 star experience.    Our server was awful.  She was nice but, sorry, pretty dumb.  The soup of the day was minestrone and she said \"Don't even ask me what's in it, cause I have no idea.\"  Really??  I think she was trying to be funny, but it was odd.  Would you ever say that as a server?  And don't most people know what's in minestrone anyway?    So then we ordered our meals.  I got the sirloin and my husband the ribeye.  The steaks came and were put in front of us.  I was pretty sure they were switched so I asked the server.  She said \"No, I know this cause of the fat line right here, that means it's a sirloin.\"  REALLY?!?!  Anyone who knows anything about steak knows that sirloin is pretty lean and ribeye is very fatty.  I couldn't believe it.  I also thought I tasted some Old Bay on my steak.  No thanks, I like just salt and pepper.  I was very unimpressed with the salad too.  Iceberg doesn't do it for me.    On the good side, the hostess and I'm guessing the manager were very nice.  Unfortunately, I probably won't be back :(",

The hostess seated us promptly, the waitress could have been a little friendlier you get the vibe that she is trying to push a lot of tables.  In a 5 star dining restaurant or at least if that is what you are going for that is a big no no.  For appetizer we had the crab dip which was on special, it was served with soft toasted bread.  The crab dip was ok a bit to salty!  For entree I ordered the $35 dollar ribeye with blue cheese crumble, which came with a salad and a side.  I was not impressed with how the salad was served which was family style sharing.  The meat was cooked perfectly, although they did forget my horse radish, and for side I had the sauteed mushrooms which were good!   At a restaurant this pricey, I felt they could have done a better job on the sides.  I would eat here again, but would like to see more offering in their combination section of their menu, example frog legs with steak or seafood would be a nice combo!",

    "text": "I really like Beef and Bottle! The first time I went was 3 years ago and just went back recently but i wish I had returned sooner! I remember the food being good, but I don't remember the steak being THAT good. I ordered the filet med-rare topped with a blue cheese crumble crust and it was absolutely delicious. The steak melted in my mouth and I devoured every single little bite.  Beef and Bottle is a very different place on the side of South Boulevard, past Skaleybark. It is (I believe) the second oldest restaurant in Charlotte and still has that old school charm and feel. The restaurant is dimly lit with white linen table cloths, and low ceilings. It is a very small restaurant and resembles a trailer, if you will. (I know that sounds terrible but it actually adds to the ambiance of the place.) There is nothing fancy about Beef and Bottle. It feels nice but you won't get the same experience as you would at Ruth's Chris.   Their menu is simple but their steaks alone are worth it. They also have a decent wine list, but I noticed that most wines are only offered by the bottle. The service was decent but they seemed a little busy when I was there.   I've seen a couple reviews complaining of the atmosphere and I think that these people were probably expecting something more than what they got at Beef and Bottle. I suggest that you visit Beef and Bottle knowing that it is over 50 years old and still doing a great job of what they do best: steak. This is a cool first date spot or a place to gather with your friends to celebrate something in a old school, gangster type way.",

    "text": "I just want to say this place deserves 5 stars more than any other place I have ever been!  Sure the place looks super sketch from the outside, the inside is definitely not your average \"5 star steakhouse restaurant\" feel, and the staff could be a little more on top of it but the food here is without a doubt the best food I've ever had in my life!  I've visited Beef & Bottle twice now and both times were incredible.  The first time was back in October 2013, when my boyfriend parents were in town.  I had the Filet Mignon (medium) with lobster tail and garlic mashed potatoes.  The Filet literally could be cut with a butter knife, it was so tender and had the best flavor I've ever had from a steak (way better than that of Fleming's, Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille, etc. you get the point!)  My boyfriend's father had the Prime Rib which he shared with us and it also was to die for, so tender, so juicy, absolute perfection!  The lobster tail, shrimp scampi, crabcake, and cocktail shrimp that I got to taste were all delicious as well!  The Caesar salad that I ordered with my meal was a typically restaurant Caesar salad, but good as well (for those who have read the review that the dressings are \"crap\"... HUGE LIE... they're amazing!  I got to sample the Ranch & Balsamic Vinaigrette)  The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy as well.  My second visit was just last Friday and once again Beef & Bottle did not disappoint!  I had to have the Filet again as it was so amazing the first time around.  This time I got a loaded baked potato as my side which was also incredible!  For my salad, I got the house which features a bowl of lettuce with an assortment of veggies (celery, radishes, cucumbers, peppers, onions) on the side to add if you like and my choice of dressing was 1000 Island.  Another winner!  I honestly think I will never experience a better steak for the rest of my life than the Filet Mignon at Beef & Bottle!  I highly recommend this place and don't let the other reviews stop you!",

My husband who has is iphone glued to his hand at all time loves looking up reviews of things before we go someplace and suggested we try this.  I was skeptical.  We pulled in and went in the back which is the main entrance.  It's dark, not very fancy, and there's Sinatra music blaring.   We were seated and given a basket of crackers to spread with delicious cheese spread.  Then we were given a lettuce salad and a tray of veggies to sort of \"make your own\" salad.  I ordered steak tips with mushrooms and peppers and had rice pilaf as my side.  My husband had the sirloin with a sweet potato.  Both were amazingly good!  The steak was cooked perfect and had been basted in garlic butter (no calories!)  For our whole dinner it was only like $17 per person including the salad, oh and they have this amazing garlic toast!  You must have some if you go.  I was definitely not psyched about going but the experience and the food will have me coming back again!",

HOWEVER, the atmosphere leaves much to be desired.  We had called ahead for reservations at 6:30 on a Friday.  When we arrived and stumbled through the extremely dark interior, we were seated by the serving door.  There were exactly 2 other couples in the entire room so plenty of empty tables.  The location was ATROCIOUS.  The servers going in and out through that door was annoying.  Not to mention, they did not keep their voices down, and their conversation was less than appropriate for the restaurant guests to overhear.  When we asked to be relocated, we were told the tables were all reserved.  For who? invisible guests?  The food was tasty, certainly not inexpensive, and the atmosphere and our experience left us wondering what all the buzz was about.  Will think twice before heading back there.",

Old school, local steakhouse the sets the mood with dark lighting, carpeted floors and rat pack music in the background. We went on 1/2 price wine night, which is the way to go. Ordered the 14oz New York Strip med-rare and it came out perfect. Flavor was good, though I like a little more char on the outside. Came w/one side and the \"create your own salad\" for $34. Not bad and I appreciate the side included in the price. I ordered the button mushrooms and onion rings on the side, though the steak does come with an onion ring garnish.  The cheese & crackers are old school. Good cheese spread with crackers still in the packet. Reminds me of the supper clubs I grew up going to in the upper Midwest. I also add a chance to taste my wife's shrimp cocktail that she ordered as part of her filet combo special that night...just ok on the shrimp. They were small and had that recent defrosted taste to them, which was a downer. Service was friendly and attentive. It's a casual place where you can save some money and get a really good steak for the money.",

I had never been, but someone mentioned B&B performed in  the style of the old 'Hereford Barn' restaurant, which was a favorite of mine in years past. The food was so-so, not very creative (except for the salad presentation), I ordered a rib-eye, my wife ordered the filet. Both were cooked well, but there was nothing special about the flavor. Overpriced is the nicest thing I can say. Our server was the exception - she was friendly, attentive and informative. She deserves to be in a better venue. After dinner we inquired about dessert & coffee and we were informed that if we wanted dessert we would have to move to the bar, as our table was reserved for someone else. Our server went to inquire with the manager and came back very apologetic to tell us we had to leave now. This seems to me to be a very rude policy, considering what we were paying for. I attempted to speak to the manager/ host on the way out, but he just shrugged me off. On the way to our car, we passed a man in ripped t-shirt and jeans, stringing lights on the outside. His chewing tobacco plug was not as alarming as his ankle monitor. We won't be returning, and I will be telling this story often.",

My husband and I were saving this groupon for a special night out.  We went to celebrate my upcoming birthday since he will be traveling on the actual day.   It was the most disappointing restaurant experience I have had in a very long time. Despite our reservations, we were seated at a rickety table next to the kitchen door. All evening the table shook anytime someone went in or out of the door.  The table was so shaky, we were worried the bottle of wine would fall of the table.  There was also dank mildew odor by our table. The noise level is very high and we found ourselves having to repeat to the server on a few occasions.   It was not a pleasing atmosphere to have a romantic dinner for 2.    The highlight of the evening was they do carry a few local wines,  we choose Childress Vineyard's Pinnacle to compliment our meal.  Although, the wrong bottle was brought the table first.    The salad was a bit sad,  iceberg lettuce, with a separate place with a few old looking cherry tomatoes, onion slices, cucumbers and radishes.  The ranch dressing was great, but the salad as a whole was a wash.    My husband ordered French Onion soup, he said it was good.  But also mentioned it tasted out of a packet, nothing terribly special.  We both had steaks, cooked medium rare.  They were good, but certainly not worth the inflated prices.    In the end our meal was about $90 (plus tip) including the bottle of wine,  its was terribly expensive way to discover the Beef and Bottle is a long-standing tradition that should die soon with all of the amazing dining choices in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Yikes!!! Real wood paneling, yes real wood. Booths with real wood backing. They killed a couple of trees to build this place. Okay they purchased the wood in 1930 and saved it until 1958 when they built the Beef & Bottle which is indicated by a sign on the building. They made a pact to never change it so the past would be preserved for anthropologist to explore.   The entrance is in the back of the building/shack. There are signs warning of twenty four hour security camera surveillance and barbed wire around the windows in the back part of the building. This is to keep out the thugs who want to steel the priceless steaks, similar to security around places like? jewelry stores. Ah yes. I knew that, so I was not afraid.   Really dark inside, Frank Sinatra music filled the air and blew me into the next room. I had been morphed back to the 1940's and decided to run with it. What the hell, you only live once.   The very nice waitress was quick to greet me and get me a glass of red wine. I needed it because the two things I am afraid of are heights and going back in a time machine.   I looked around and thought I saw Elvis but it was really dark so I could not be sure. So, I am thinking this is some kind of neighborhood nostalgia restaurant for everyone who once did and still wants to live in the Sinatra, Dean Martin, Marylin Monroe era. Was the Mafia here tonight for dinner? The music was starting to wear me down when they played \"Lets Make Whoopee\" I was getting really irritated and prayed for soft jazz or classical music. Nope, here comes the Andrews sisters, I think. Then more Frank Sinatra.  I ordered the protected jewel, \"Steak\". A ribeye steak with baked potato and sauteed mushrooms. Mushrooms from a can. That was a big dagger. Maybe they did not have fresh mushrooms back in those days.   The steak was okay, a little salty but not bad. The potato was a potato. The salad was fresh and they let you assemble it yourself. This is a restaurant that has not reinvested in their future. They will sell the property to someone who will build a self storage business here and that will be the end. My rating is somewhat generous. A below average price/value proposition at this restaurant.   I would consider other steak houses in the area for dining unless you want to go back in your time machine for an average meal. Probably a cool bar scene with live music on the weekend.  This is a 2.5 star rated establishment. My apologies to the other reviewers I don't agree with high ratings for this joint.",

    "text": "The shrimp scampi was wonderful.  However, the prime rib was way over seasoned.  Too much salt and pepper and I could not eat.  The mgr came out and offered to replace.  It was to late and my friends were just about through eating.  He kindly took it off my bill.  Now that is  the way it should be and I appreciated it.  On the other hand, my friends had the prime rib as well and liked it.  I guess it is just a matter of taste.  Service was excellent and I will go again and try another beef product.",

    "text": "We have been to the Beef and Bottle several times in the past and always had a good experience.  The food has always been good and the service as well.  Unfortunately, I recently had a very unsettling phone conversation with the manager as I was trying to set up a reservation.  4 couples bought a Living Social with the hopes of having a nice dinner together.  It says in the fine print of the coupon that you can only use one per table.  I was hoping that we might be granted an exception, especially when I explained that it would be the same for them either way - we would come and sit at 4 separate tables and use 4 vouchers OR they could just let us sit together.  Alas, no exception and a very rude manager as I tried to explain how they were not going to be out any more money.  Oh well . . . . . . One of our favorites just became NOT one of our favorites . . . . . . It's not so much that I didn't get the answer I wanted, it was the way I was treated on the phone - definitely not professional and quite rude.",

It's a very funky old building with very low light level, lots of pictures of 40's - 50's celebs, constant rat pack music (I heard \"I Did it My Way\" twice during the evening) and what has always looked to be a crowd of dedicated regulars.  I had  a dozen oysters ( total disaster- more later).  Mashed red skin potatoes.  Medium rare fillet Mignon and shrimp scampi, ice cream and coffee.  I'll start with the best.  My steak was perfectly prepared and very tasty.  The shrimp scampi was cooked properly but the spices were a long way from \"scampi\".  Mostly the shrimp just floated in a very heavy, greasy, butter sauce. The potatoes were acceptable i.e properly cooked. They were bland with no spice and no butter served on the side.  B&B's butter is a hard mysterious, orange, blob that  only vaguely approximates butter.   The salads at B&B have always been a problem for me in that they consist of a plate of Peter Rabbit  lettuce served with a separate plate of radishes , onions, green peppers etc that you can add to the lettuce.  The dressing is touted as being  home made.  My French dressing was so bland that it just seemed like oily tomato flavored ???.  The only ice cream that they had was Cinnamon flavored - very mediocre.  I think they expected you to order this with their Apple pie.  My coffee was good.   Now the oysters.  Twelve oysters ($16) arrived served  OUT OF A BOTTLE on these little BS china Oyster shells on a bed of ice along with - you guessed it- another little tub of very bland sauce.  They were not fresh and were just terrible.  After eating a few I began to worry about the possibility of them making me sick.  When I questioned my waitress about this she said she was sorry but that the Health Dept. did not allow oysters to be served on the half shell.  I asked her if she had ever been to Vinnies up the street and she replied that she didn't think that they served fresh oysters either.  Note after leaving B&B I went by Vinnies and had a great dozen fresh oysters on the half shell.  (Delicious and $10.49).  I must also say that I had to wait for about 4o minutes for my food even though they were far from busy.   I went to B&B remembering some of the quirky aspects of this old fashioned Restaurant.  I was not prepared however for the bad food I received or the cavalier attitude on the part part of the staff when I pointed this out.  I won't be back.",

    "text": "After reading the good and not so good reviews of this restaurant, my husband and I decided to give it a try  We went on a Friday night without reservations. To start off with when we entered your eyes really have to adjust to the very dark dinning room.  There was a couple in front of us with reservations and when we heard the host telling them in not such a friendly manner that they were early we knew this wasn't going to be good...lol.  We were told that the  only seating available was in the bar.  The waitress promptly escorted us to this area that was an enclosed cement floor like patio area.  The table we were offered was this tiny high top that would almost fit two people not very comfortably.  We looked at the rest of the room and there were a BUNCH of table clothed tables empty.  We asked if we could sit at one of those and she just said \"No.\"  We weren't even offered a wait time in which we could have been sat in the dinning room or bar/patio tables. The main dinning room wasn't even full.  My husband and I decided to leave and the hostess showed us a back door out.  Not even a little apologetic.  So we ended up dinning at a wonderful restaurant downtown.  So my rating is not on the food but on how they treat their diners.  We won't even give them a second chance.  Not all the reviews have  been great for their food and the prices are pretty steep for a place that looks horrible on the outside and cold on the inside.  O, there is a $5 coupon on their website.  That will cover cheese and bacon on two baked potatoes.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me by a friend.  After riding by the place, I was a little skeptical, but decided to give it a whirl.  You definitely feel like you've stepped back into the 70's when you enter this place, but I think that's the best part about it.  Waiters are dressed in tuxes and take very good care of you.  They bring you vegetables to build your own salad and they give you enough to make like 4 salads (for just 2 people).  We both got steaks and they were very tender and flavorful.  I got the cheapest steak on the menu and I still have to say that it was a very nice steak.  Steaks run between $20-30 which is not too bad.",
