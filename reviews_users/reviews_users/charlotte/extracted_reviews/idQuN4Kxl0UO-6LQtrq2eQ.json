Came here for dinner couple  more times and unfortunately the food changed . No longer flavorful. Everything greasy and overcooked .. everything tasted the same .. tried couple of pieces and general Ts chicken and it was so overcooked I couldn't swallow it . Too bad, I really had hopes for this place .. their service is pretty good and we sit in booth so I never notice them hovering over us .",

    "text": "Just ate at this place for the first time yesterday, as my family and I walked in we loved the look of the place. Time was clearly spent on making it look nice and the place is huge. We ordered our drinks and went to get our food, everything was well until we noticed one of the employees just staring at us, we blew it off at first but then after a minute or two glance back and she's syrup looking and we decide to finish up and go back to our seat. The food to be honest was not the best, most of it was cold and had no flavor but anyways...Going back a second time the same employee is there and she goes somewhere in the back and does what she was going to do and while my mom was walking by her the employee could've broken her neck by the way she decided to once again stare at us and not in a friendly way. A few minutes later I got up to get sushi which I have to say was personally pretty good and probably my favorite thing I ate there, but when I did go get it and turned around to go back to my table there were legit about 6 employees just standing there staring as if they were trying intimidate me or something. I know it sounds odd but I agree it was, I felt extremely uncomfortable doing anything there because I felt like I was being judged the whole time, and we are definitely never going back.",

I went up to talk to her and her and a worker talking in Asian said I had eat all my plate which I didn't. The server quickly took my food off the table but left my sons plate! How ironic is that right!!! Long story short I had to go back and forth with someone who was not listening and it was not until I asked for the owner where she took off the food and allowed me to pay for what was eaten! Which I asked to do from jump! The food is not fresh and I will NEVER be back!!!",

    "text": "The other reviewers are spot on. First, I've been to the other matthews buffet, not even a mile from this one, multiple times, so, if I happen to say \"in comparison\" - that's what I'm comparing it to. My thoughts: This buffet is beautifully designed, and there are few customers compared to the other local option. We were greeted warmly and allowed to check out the buffet before deciding. Right away I could tell this had as many, or more, options as their competitor, and the sushi looked (and tasted) much more authentic and fresh. They also had custom soup bar which I and my boys enjoyed (exceptions below). Some of the foods were greasy, as said in other reviews, but these are the foods you'd expect to be a little greasy at a buffet. Otherwise, the food was probably 3.5 stars/5.  Negatives: I could not find their prices online, and the other reviewer mentioned a cheaper lunch option. That's True but ONLY on weekdays. Weekend lunches are dinner price (12.99).  Also, they only had soft serve. Their competitor has 6-8 flavors of normal ice cream. The soup bar was great, but the chefs did not speak English, so it was impossible to get the order right. He asked if I wanted spicy or not, I said \"a little\" and he looked as if I'd given him a complicated calculus problem. Neither of my boys wanted meat in their soup, but they got it anyway. ? That's after he said \"no meat\" -repeating my order, multiple times.  Lastly, the other reviewers are right, the wait staff HOVERS over you. They were pleasant, but twice we had to tell them we weren't finished with our plate! Secondly, there was actually TOO many staff. (Maybe if they had less they could lower the price?) Lastly, my boys and I got up to get dessert, when we came back they'd CLEARED our table . Yes, I'd already paid, but that was pretty hasty and inconsiderate. She nicely apologized and asked if we wanted our waters back, I declined. I was ready to head out. Lastly, for the three of us, it cost $9 more than the competitor. So, I guess I'll stick with the other option. (And NO, I don't work for them.)",

We went for our Christmas dine-in and I just fell in love with the options the buffet offered. There was a sushi bar, noodle bar, and pho soup. I got 5 dishes in total and was sooo full. The first plate I got was assorted sushi with salmon and spicy rolls, the second plate I got pho, third plate spicy noodles, fourth plate I got chicken, fifth plate: dessert. However I left room for dessert because I love the lychees. During lunch time adult pricing is $9. It was nice because there was a lot of room and we got a long table. The service was amazing and I would recommend this place. It is really good for big families! I never felt so full but in a good way :)",

They have everything from a salad bar with traditional Chinese buffet items, fresh made sushi, a soup station, making your favorite Vietnamese soup and a Hibachi station, which is what I ate, I got to pick all my favorites and have it grilled right in front on me. I would definitely say as with any buffet go at lunch or dinner busier times so the food will always be fresh and I'm pretty sure you can find whatever you want to feast on. Also don't let the outside fool you, it is very nice inside!",

    "text": "Second time here, first was a week ago for lunch, tonight was for dinner (8:30pm Friday night).  The buffet selection was okay.  Some items were very good, some weren't.  Mushroom chicken was very good, the orange beef was overly candied and hard to find the beef.  The honey chicken was good, the coconut shrimp was too candied and sticky.  The star of the buffet was the noodle soup bar.  Basically you choose what style broth/soup you want and what style noodle and they make it fresh in like 30 seconds piping hot.  I had the curry soup with udon noodles.  Wow....amazing.  I will come back here just for the soup....but during lunch...not dinner.  Dinner was $16.xx for one person and a soda after tax.  Lunch comes in around $10 I believe.  Anyhow, back to the soup, they probably should have opened a noodle bar instead and saved on rent.  This place had the potential to be really good if they can get rid of the overly greasy or candied dishes, it seems a number of the dishes they make don't hold up well on the buffet line with constant heat just sitting there.  On a side note the table staff seem to hover and spy on you like they're overtly waiting for you to finish so they can flip the table.  I know buffet waitstaff sometimes try and over-do the drink refills and dirty plate removal so they can make a case for a tip but.....its a very fine line.  Give em a shot while everything is nice and new.",

The employees here are very courteous and always remember stuff like what I drink and my name. I do love that they have a fresh bocce Grill and that they will make you sushi to order that is a part of the all you can eat. The food here is absolutely delicious and they did not compromise quality for price because they are reasonably priced with amazing food.

Not the best all you eat Chinese buffet I've ever been so far. With this experience, I will suggest that customers should look around the buffet first and inspect the food quality and cleanliness of the restaurant prior to sitting. This will save you disappointment and a lot of money for a bad quality food!!!   Literally all of the food was very old and very dry looking like the life was sucked out of it (probably been sitting there for at least 4+ hours!)! Except one of the shrimp dish. It looks like they stopped putting fresh food out at the buffet stations. Most of the dishes were almost out as well and they were not being replaced nor refilled for the customers that just walked in. Not fair for the people that just came in.   It is pricey, specially for children, who don't eat much compared to the cost. This is not worth $13.99 to be honest.   In all fairness I will give 1 star for restaurant cleanliness ( bathroom/restaurant) and another 1 star for having friendly servers.",

I will try anything, so for me to recognize how unusual it was is a big deal. I'm sure we're going to give it another try, some of the food is really good and unique.

Now my parents have some weird obsession with Chinese buffers. I'm not sure if it's the love of Americanized Chinese food or the ability to eat whatever you want and as much as you want. Me however I'm not a fan of Chinese buffets. I really got my hopes up when I saw all the different options Asian Buffet and Grill had to offer. There is sushi, hibachi, a soup station and several different hot and cold food buffet options. I was most excited for the soup station. Not to many Chinese buffets have these stations and they are my favorite. The station had 6 different soups you could choose from and 4 different noodle options. I chose the curry with the rice vermicelli.  The broth was not very flavorful at all. It had a very faint curry taste. My nephew got the Vietnamese pho soup. This broth seemed to have a little more flavor but was still very bland.   My hibachi dinner was good. I appreciated all of the options they had for this station and the speed of the cook. He was on it! My other hot food was good from the buffet. I also liked how they had a very varied set of dishes for you to choose from. And there wasn't pizza and Mac-a-roni like some other buffets. Someone explain how those got in the mix?   When we arrived the place was very empty but as we finished they were running a wait. They staff was kinda half busing the tables in the beginning of our meal and towards the end they were more on top of it because of their wait.   All in all I think this Chinese buffet is a better option in the charlotte area. I just need them to give those broths some more flavor!

I figured this place would be good for having options to choose from. We came around 7pm to have dinner on Saturday night. Lack of fresh options, noodles and rice were always low. It wasn't even busy. Seemed like a slow restaurant for a Saturday night. Staff was friendly. Never ran low on drinks. We had a child with us and he seemed to love all the fruits and snacks. Even the cotton candy that was there lol. The sushi was ok. Not my go to place to eat but it did it's just for feeding those who wanted sushi. I usually take photos, but for a buffet place... it was too much to try and keep track of.",

    "text": "You'll find a huge variety of foods here! Vast majority is Chinese, with some typical popular entrees and some fave seafood options, including Salmon, Scallops, Shellfish and Crabmeat...though surprisingly, not much Dim Sum. Also, a great variety of Sushi/Maki, Soup and Noodles.  Not a big selection of desserts, but quite a surprising (and almost too random!) dessert option, Cotton Candy! Yes, LOL...just what you'd find in local festivals! Actually made the entire buffet experience a tad more fun.  The restaurant itself was much bigger than anticipated, with divided sections...great for big groups. Again, the buffet selection was huge... with some interesting options, like Udon, Pho, even Kimchee...and again, Cotton Candy! And yes, everything  tasted good on the most part. Now, I must mention a few negatives. I thought the buffet layout was awkward. Some of the buffet selections were spaced so far apart, it was easy to miss an entire section! My biggest complaint is the air conditioning. Despite the huge space, the place felt a bit too warm. If the entire place was better air conditioned, the dining experience itself would have been much nicer. So please, more AC! Overall, a great buffet restaurant...with just a few areas that can be improved.",

It was a little too greasy for my taste, as well as some of the other patrons based off off their facial expressions when they bit into something.   I still believe this place can turn it around though. With a little tweaking this could be a powerhouse.",

The staff was also pretty sweet too and want to make sure the customers are happy.   But the food, the food is really salty!! They offer a lot of seafood, from crab to crawfish. The clams were awful, it was very fishy and not cleaned well. They even had steak (what?) which actually wasn't too bad. The sushi is interesting, a lot of sauce though. I tried one of the soups and got Curry Noodle and it was extremely water, but definitely could be improved! Overall just super salty and I don't want to drive that far for salty food!",

They had a salad station which I did not touch lol. I first went to the noodle bar. I got my soup with udon noodles and was surprised at how much they gave me. It was good but I would definitely ask for half of that portion next time. They had an assortment of asian food and a hibachi station. I didn't get a chance to get hibachi because I was too full. I tried their assortment of asian food and it was all good. Average, but not great. Typical asian buffet. Worth the money because they are generally cheaper that most buffets.",

It's a very large buffet and in the center they have a Noodle Station as well as a Hibachi grill and sushi. It will take several visits to sample all they have available, so I focused on my favorites. Pepper steak, spicy squid, Mei fun, stir fried pepper shrimp. I found some Kimchi on the salad bar and noticed that they had lychee as well as chocolate pudding. I need to bring my wife and son back as they prefer more traditional offerings versus Americanized Asian food.",

    "text": "Exterior: This location used to be a seafood restaurant. The lot is large but from the outside, it looks a bit dingy. They tried to upgrade it by adding on a nice wooden door and some stone work.   Interior: Absolutely stunning once you step through the doors. There is a tiny waterfall pond fountain right by the door. The walls are gorgeous and so is the starry color changing ceiling near the front counter. The hibachi / sushi / noodles bar is in the center of the buffet area. It separates the dessert from the main courses. Very spacious for gatherings or large groups.  For the interior alone, I would give it 5 stars. It would have to be the best looking buffet offered in Charlotte (Yes, I'm even comparing it to Tin's)   Food: Well, I would say the best they have to offer is the hibachi / sushi / noodles bar. My husband is very particular with his beloved pho. He tried the Vietnamese noodle and the broth was surprisingly good. They also offered wonton noodle soup, duck soup and some others. Sushi was fresh and there were a variety.   Besides that area, the rest of the food options are pretty basic. Nothing too special and it's the typical buffet options.   Pricing: It's the most wallet friendly in comparison to the surrounding Asian buffet off Independence Blvd. (in case you're unaware, there are a total of three Asian buffets including this location)   Would I return? Sure. I don't mind it. It's pretty restaurant to look at and grubbing on noodles and sushi would probably be the best thing. Staff are very friendly and don't feel pushy unlike the other buffets in the areas. Would I recommend this location? Yeah. Just as long you're not driving far away. If you're in the area, stop by and try it.",

Hot food, soup, fresh sushi, noodles, fruits, etc. They also have an area to make hibachi and teriyaki dishes right in front of you. Asked the sushi chef for a specific type of sushi & he actually brought it to our table. (Don't worry, we left a tip!) Service was super friendly and wonderful. Definitely going to come here more often! Such an affordable buffet for what they serve. You spend $8 on a combo at a fast food restaurant for a burger, fries, and a drink. You spend $11 here for dinner and GET A HUGE BUFFET WITH SUSHI and everything above. This place does not get enough recognition! 5/5.",

    "text": "This buffet was actually a pleasant surprise! Taking the place of a dilapidated seafood restaurant on busy Independence, they've spruced up the place a lot. Inside, there's a large water feature upon entering and a pagoda in the center that houses a wide selection of sushi (for a buffet), build your own hibachi and made-to-order pho and soup station. Outside, the signage is strange (sounds and looks like they picked the name of the place from a random sign they found) and it looks like it could double as a gentleman's club (I.e. no windows).   Back to the food - there are multiple hot tables with a variety of mostly Asian dishes, though also plenty of American options including french fries and fried corn and some other options like fried plantains. There are also serval cold tables including salad, fresh fruit and pre-made desserts. Big plus, there's also a soft-serve machine! Sadly, there are no toppings to be had. :-(  When you walk in, you're greeted immediately and the service has been generally very friendly, with quick removal of used plates. The real value is it's only $8.99 for lunch, and they offer to-go by the lb. if you're in a rush. Though it costs more if you get seafood or sushi. I'll continue to visit weekly as the sushi is good for the price and the location is convenient!",

I have done this quite a few times at Chinese buffets and they just give you one box to fill until your heart's desire. And their pricing wasn't too generous either . Lunch: $4.99/lb. Dinner: $5.99/lb. Sushi/Seafood: $8.99/lb. Trust me, their seafood is not worth the $8.99/lb price tag. My box of assorted sushi (I went for just the sushi) came out to be 1.9 lbs. I was very disappointed that I would have to pay $20 for some buffet grade sushi. I gently expressed that I had never seen the \"by-the-pound\" concept at Chinese buffets and he said \"how else will we charge ppl for unlimited food?\".... Ummm by the Box!!!  Luckily, the cashier said he would give $2 discount and then charged me even lower price. Which made this trip worthwhile ... But I doubt I will ever do a carry-out again. I mean, had I gone for just Dine-in I would have easily eaten/wasted four times the amount I brought home with me.  All said and done... The food is pretty good for a Asian buffet in Charlotte. Good selection for a weekday. Went on Thursday afternoon. Lunch buffet was $5.99.",
