This place is like eating with family, it is close to the house so we can cruise over on the golf cart and enjoy dine in or carry out. Pizzas a huge with big foldable slices, great fresh dough and toppings every time. Staff is very friendly and they have a good selection of bottle beer.",

We had the garlic knots to start which were great and I had a chicken, bacon & garlic slice, while my fiance had the rigatoni with vodka sauce and added chicken. Both choices came with your typical pizza parlor side salad- fresh but nothing special. However, I was really wow'd at the end with the chocolate dipped canoli we got. So. Fabulous! Service was good, and we will definitely be back!",

Of course the classic pepperoni is also a winner. Definitely call ahead because they're usually packed, especially on a Friday night...my only complaint is that usually they under quote me on wait time and it ends up being more like an hour rather than 45 minutes on a Friday night. I've gone a few times on Sunday and the wait is much shorter. Also, there are not a lot of places to sit so I just pick up my food to go.",

The garlic knots were very good, but the pepperoni pizza was super greasy.  I had to lay two paper towels on top of the pizza slice to soak up the grease before I could eat it. I then wrapped the wadded up greasy paper towel in another paper towel, and the grease soaked through that second paper towel.  After soaking up all the grease, the pizza was pretty good, but why so greasy to begin with?  I would give the pizza another chance, but may stick to plain cheese pizza if the pepperoni is going to be that greasy.  On the plus side, the service and the garlic knots were both excellent.",

I was put on hold for every single question I asked regarding the menu and had to repeat myself several times because the person taking my order over the phone said that she kept \"accidentally forgetting\" what I said.

When I asked where this bill came from, I was told the Mediterranean salad was $11.95, yet the menu says it's priced at $9.50..... when I asked why I was being charged an additional $2.45 extra per salad, I was told \"I'm not sure why the salad is priced differently, but I don't see the menu or really have an explanation\". When the salads arrived they didn't even have the feta or pita bread that is supposed to be included. I was told by friends to order salads from Carmella's pizza and save my time, but figured I would give this place a try, I definitely will not waste my time nor money in this local small business again.",

I should also mention that the pizza was not that great. Actually it was all around bad. Village pizza is right down the street and a lot better and cleaner! Also it's more reasonably priced.",

Danny's pies are New York-style thin crusts with chewy borders and a delightful yeasty aftertaste that a lot of pizzas I've eaten lack. Also, if you're accustomed to ordering small, medium and large pies, Danny's pizza sizes are larger than most other places, with 10, 18, and 24 inch crusts. We ordered the 18\" Extreme Specialty pizza and the Family Special #4, which is a one-topping 18\" pizza (pepperoni), garlic knots, and a dozen wings. Those pies were so delicious, piled thick with fresh toppings and perfectly baked. The wings are not the over-breaded greasy variety that you may have grown to expect from some places, but meaty, flavorful and tossed in your choice of sauce. We opted for mild and they were amazing, tangy, with a crisp skin. Found my go-to pizza place (thanks, Yelp)!",

Then we get a call at 6:18PM, there was a mistake on our part, on the Alfredo. They said they would take care of it. 7:40 PM no food. My wife calls to check and they say that they got slammed and it takes that long and it's on it's way. 7:53 PM they call us back apologizing that they never printed the receipt and it was overlooked. Finally at about 8:10 the food arrives. The delivery guy, who was great by the way, was very polite and apologetic. He wouldn't accept a tip even though he had no part in the problem. Now on to the food. The calzone was cold and oily. My daughter had to throw it in the microwave to make it even remotely hot. None of the other dishes were remotely hot either. My son's Alfredo was cold and had separated, you could tell it had sat around for a while as it was semi-transparent. I would call it lukewarm at best. The Ziti was cold and flavorless unless you count the over use of both thick sliced and chopped garlic. The lasagnas were not even close to warm. There was way too much garlic in this as well. no one ate all of their entree and I had to share my salad with my daughter. The salads were very bland but I will say they were the highlight of the meal. It's kind of hard to screw up bagged salads not that they didn't try though by not giving enough dressing with them. They threw in an order of garlic knots. They should have kept them. They were very. close to being underdone and no flavor at all. We'll never eat there again. I have half a mind to dispute it with the CC company. It's that bad.  Edited 9-5-17 I was contacted by the company and they did in fact refund our purchase price. they took ownership of the issue and took steps to remedy the situation. As I responded to the owner every business has it's off days and everyone has bad luck. The two just seemed to coincide on this occasion. It wasn't personal on either side just the way things worked out. I wish them luck with the new location in Fort Mill.",

    "text": "Definitely not NY pizza. I couldn't taste the sauce..pizza was dried up. Service was great. But Pizza is def not up to par. pizza was dry. Just when you walk in you see the dried up pizzas sitting there. The problem with that is once it goes back in the oven, itdries up the sauce and cheese. So they need to learn to resauce or rewater their pizza before it goes back in the oven. For FORT MILL standards it is good pizza. They also short change the folks on the size of the slice. It is a tad smaller than a regular slice. I am from Brooklyn.  So anyone reading...do not go by reviews from people upstate NY or outside of the boroughs. True NY pizza lives in Brooklyn FYI. Not manhattan, not the bronx, not LI let alot alone upstate. That is a no no.",

It used to be great. To bad it's so awful. Having New York pictures on the wall doesn't mean great pizza.",

We ordered a grilled chicken over salad and a couple slices of pizza.  Salad was just ok, same quality as if I bought it in the pre-made section of the supermarket and the slices must have been old and re-heated.  Nothing here makes me want to come back, so many places to eat here that in my opinion you need to stand out to get business,  this place does not do it for us.  Especially pizza, coming from NY, there is a certain expectation that follows,  it has to be good, quality ingredients,  anything else is unacceptable.",

It will be perfect.  The Sicilian Pizza has a thick crust that my kids loved. The salads are excellent & the Italian dressing is awesome.  I love the cannoli because they are really fresh and not overly sweet.  The beer selection is nice without a draft option.  The wine list is simple but fits the menu.  Jessi was our waitress twice and was very attentive and nice (a rarity in Fort Mill eateries).",

Then she didn't get our drink order for several more minutes. Finally the manager came over to at least get the drinks. When they came, they tasted horrible and the waitress (had to flag her down) made an excuse that the ice machine was in disrepair and making all the sodas taste wrong. Interesting. If that was the case wouldn't you think that they might have told us before taking our drink orders? But oh well.   Ordered an appetizer of garlic knots. They arrived after 10 minutes and tasted old - like they sat out for a while and were re-warmed and they weren't good. We didn't eat them. To their credit, they brought fresh ones without us saying anything and those were much better.   The food was average for a pizza joint in Fort Mill, which isn't saying much. It's ok, not bad but not great either.   Some of the other items on the menu looked good as we saw other tables receiving their orders. Maybe we'll give it another try and order something other than pizza and get recyclable drinks!",

    "text": "Danny's Pizza and Pasta opened a couple of weeks ago in front of the Tega Cay Walmart.  A few people said good things about them, but a lot of people also said that about the recently opened Mama's in Indian Land and it was not too good.  Danny's was slightly better, but not by much.  After receiving a 20% off coupon in the local coupon magazine, I figured it would be worth a try.    The people working were very friendly.  I ordered an 18 cheese pie.  It was decent, but was overdone (what is it with the pizza places around here overcooking the pies?  This was charred on the bottom, like many other local places).  The dough had some flavor to it, the sauce was okay, and oregano was added to the top of the pizza.  If your pizza is good, oregano is not necessary (see Lorenzo's/Junior's).  The dough was slightly thicker than NY style, but not by much.  They don't say they are NY style, but it definitely is.  The menu is also a bit limited.  There are no chicken wings, but they may be good because most places similar to this around here do not make good ones.  The pizza topping choices are also a bit limited.  It is a small place, so it is understandable, but it is always good to have choices.  So, this is again one of those pizza places that just needs a couple of tweaks.  Next time, I will order the pizza light baked and without oregano.  I think it would make it very good.",

Danny's is a nice looking spot at the end of this small strip plaza that is an outparcel of the Walmart Supercenter.  A gelato bar at the left when you enter and then the counter with fresh pizza slices available further back. Of course, they do a lot more than pizza but that's all I felt like having today. So I picked my slice and the gal had it heated up and brought to me a few moments later.  Sicilian-style, meatball and ricotta. Plenty hot, nice and tasty. I loved the crispy crunchy pizza crust underneath and the toppings completely covered it. Very tasty. I'll have to come back here for something more than just a slice.  There's an outside patio, which is nice. If you can ignore the fact that it overlooks a Walmart parking lot.",

Our orders were delivered, and his pizza was COLD.  Our waitress apologized, and took it back.  15-20 minutes later, my husband asked about his pizza, and the girl hurried over and asked cook.  They both look into the warmer part of the oven, and pull out a dried-out, burnt piece of pizza.  She put it on a plate and handed it to my husband!   He handed it right back.  I watched, as she told the manager in the back , but he NEVER EVEN APPROACHED OUR TABLE.  The waitress barely apologized, and said \"I took it off the bill\", like she was doing us a favor.  I found the Chicken to be overly salty and dried out.  Needless to say, we will NOT be back!",

    "text": "Good pizza is hard to find (my family drives 3 hours to the nearest Rosati's). I'd say with confidence that Danny's is good pizza and has become our go-to (though when we want cheap pizza we get Domino's). They have great specials in case you're by yourself or one other person. My wife and I typically get the slice + salad combo (there's just something to be said about a good side salad). I'm usually a pepperoni guy, but their cheese is really good as-is, so I just get that every time. I wish they had a better, cozier space but that won't deter me from coming in. The staff are all really very nice and get things done quick.   One qualm is that their thin crust pizza is too thin and because of it, it easily gets overcooked (i.e. - burnt on the bottom). A touch more cheese would be nice as well.   A minor qualm is that the cannolis seem over priced. My experience is they should be $2-2.50 and freshly made (though I've never had the cannoli here so I don't know if it's freshly made or store-bought).  An easy yes if you're looking for pizza.",

Being originally from upstate New York, I haven't found any places that even compare to that NY Italian.... UNTIL DANNYS! Now I can only comment on the pizza thus far because I hadn't even scoped the whole menu and reviews to see suggestions. But some fellow NYs said the cannoli is fresh and True to home cafes so tonight I will have one, or two ;)  ANYWAYS... THE PIZZA WAS PERFECTION. Tastes identical in every aspect to authentic upstate pizza!! So so delicious!  If I could make a suggestion to the owners... {not sure what you grew up with.... but ...} I would love to see authentic upstate Syracuse/Utica tomato pie, or \"pusties\" (pasticiotti) on the menu... *drool*   Okay time to order tonight's feast!!",

What all of us \"Yankees\" need to realize is that we are not in New York anymore and we have to make due with what is available to us.     That being said, I entered Danny's Pizza and Pasta in Tega Cay, SC with not a lot of expectations. It was right before lunch, so I grabbed a couple of slices to go. The cashier was friendly and the place was clean, so we are off to a good start.      I sat in my car, throw open the box and liked what I saw. Looked just like the stuff I grew up eating. The smell was wonderful. I guess I should mention I was starving. The pizza was delicious. It wasn't spot on NY pizza, but it was really freaking good. If I had any critique, it would be that there was something missing in the sauce and they could have left the slices in the oven a minute longer. That's just being picky. Danny's is definitely a hit in my book. Can't wait to go back.",

Its as if they bought a bunch of frozen dinner rolls from the Walmart behind the store, twisted them and added a little bit of garlic.  Just terrible.

My pizza was ready but not my dough knots. There was no one in the place and like 5 people working. Why wasn't my food ready? So by time I got home my pizza was cold. The dough knots really should have some cheese in them because they are really plain. The pizza dough was really tall and too much. I had a white sauce pizza and the sauce was so plain I couldn't taste it. All I tasted was bread. It was also a 10\" pizza and it seemed really small. Most personal pizzas at other places are 11\" or 12\". The restaurant was clean but the food just wasn't anything special or good.",

Someone from NY when I was in Walmart, said go to Danny's right up the hill.   Well I have to say this is definitely a top pizza on my list!  The sauce was almost as good as my mom's. Liked the meatball and ricotta slice. The meat lover stuffed pie was just as tasty and the dipping sauce was like a wow wow. Liked it was not so acidity as other place I thought were good were.  The zeppoli are definitely not the way mom made them and were not my omg I feel like I am at home with mom again, BUT, the absolutely  passed my I would go for more again.  Loved the staff who I felt like I may have scared them when I said I heard they were authentic NYer and I'm testing out NY places for authenticity.  Take a breath for now you passed this Italianmomma1's tasting, but I will be back for other sampling",

The 45 minute ready time was a bit disappointing, but maybe that meant people love the place so they are busy on a Saturday.   The young girl that took the call seemed a bit confused or flustered when I was trying to explain my order.  I waited the time and went to pick it up. Most everyone working there seemed flustered and necessarily happy to be there. Odd.. for a busy time.  The pizza was huuge! Very delicious and you can definitely tell a difference compared to the national chain pizza brands. So much better. We also ordered two side salads. They were a decent size, with basic iceberg, tomato, cheese in a traditional aluminum round container.  Will certainly be back. Check mailers and the website for coupons!",

I've noticed however the last couple of times, the tomato sauce on the pizzas have been lacking pretty significantly.  I think it's so important to have a good balance between toppings, sauce & crust but it's very little tomato sauce and the tiny bit of sauce that is being put on the pizza has been pushed out to the edge.  Very disappointing when we pay good amount of money for an above average pizza and it's off balance.    Please...please...please look into this and find out what's going on as it seems your quality control is off.",

Danny's is hands-down the best pizza I have had in the Charlotte/Fort Mil/Tega Cay area.  My personal favorite is the Roman pizza + proscuitto, but my co-workers love the Meatalicious pizza.  They do have other entree options (pasta, stromboli, calzones, etc.) that are OK and good for the sake of variety, but you would be an idiot to come here and not eat the pizza.  Come for lunch -- great lunch specials!  I do agree with one of the other reviewers here that their quality has changed a bit over the last year, but I wish he hadn't left a 1-star review, as that is NOT an accurate representation of Danny's.  Their pizza is still one of the best in the area, without question.  They recently opened a second location in Fort Mill, so I am not sure whether this change in quality is just a result of new staff being trained (a problem with any small business expanding), so don't let that deter you from coming!",

I know it's hard to find good pizza in the south and as an Upstate New Yorker I have a hard time finding just that.  I ordered delivery service and was told that I would receive my order in 45 minutes. I got off the phone and the time was 3:23pm When my delivery finally came at 4:55pm, I was greeted by a nice driver that apologized for taking so long. The pizzas were in flimsy boxes and when I opened them the pizza looked horrible. Tasted bland. Cheese was very skimpy, dough was very chewy, and the sauce... Disgusting. No taste at all. The garlic knots were not good either.  Worst experience all around. I will be sure to stick with Village Pizza as they have never displeased me.  Like I said, I only tried Danny's because of the reviews. Sorry, but obviously people have not had good pizza before if they actually think that Danny's is good!!",

The slices are huge, we each ordered 2 slices and ended up taking the second one home for dinner. My boyfriend ordered the meat lover's and says it's great the second time around as well. I ordered a slice of extreme and a slice of the margiano. The extreme was delicious but I wasn't a fan of the margiano. I tasted it fresh and it wasn't bad, but I decided not to eat it reheated. Not much selection of specialty pies, but what they do have all sounds pretty tasty. Seems a little pricey on the pasta side of things, but we are big fans of local restaurants so we will definitely go back to try some of their other offerings.",

I just don't like that you order a slice, they yell the order to the back kitchen ( while the ovens and pizza are in the front) and then you wait ten minutes and they bring the slice out to you at a table or counter. ( only a couple of customers there when I went). They will bring you parm cheese & red pepper but not the garlic. You have to go to the front to retrieve the spice. They need more counter space to sit at and/ or single or double person tables.  It would be just like NY if you could order the slice at the counter and wait a minute or two, they hand you the slice and then go sit wherever you want.  Maybe with practice this will happen. I will go back for the pizza but to hell with the service. PS: I spent a little over $5 for one slice and a small soda. A bit pricey, I think.",

Danny( the owner ) and Danny( the manager ) both clearly realize that their customers make the business go and do what they can to keep you happy . 5 stars for the service you receive and 5 stars ( only because I can't give more ) for the pizza . Absolutely amazing food with just as amazing management running the place . I was considering 2 homes to purchase recently that I was very undecided on . Honestly , the fact that one of them was in Dannys delivery area played into my decision because the properties were so close to the same to me . Outstanding pizza !!!

No one here knows how to do pizza in True NY style (and believe me, we have tried ALL of them in ten years), but Danny certainly does.   Although the service was kind of a mess the first few weeks they were open, we have been taking out since then, and the pizza has been ready as promised each time.  I will say that I was a bit grossed out that none of the food prep help was wearing hair nets, hats, or gloves, but at least they prepare the pizza right in front of you so you can see where those hands are, and I did not see anyone handling food and then handling money--if that had not been the case, I would have been out of there. Danny, invest in a few paper hats, please! This is the only reason I did not give it five stars.  The crust has the right amount of char on the bottom and is exactly the right thickness to fold--crispy edges, soft on the inside...yum. We only order plain cheese, so I can't speak for toppings. However, the cheese is extremely generous and the sauce does not taste like it came out of a can--just a light, delicate tomato flavor. This is not pizza for the health-conscious; it is loaded with melted cheese and cheese has oil, but isn't that the whole idea behind a good pie? Could go a little lighter on the oregano, but overall, this pizza is delicious. I hope they will stay busy and in business for a long time!",

    "text": "Finally!!!  You have to try this place.  Finally a great authentic NY presence in Fort Mil!  My husband is from Long Island and we have tried almost every Italian pizza place in our vicinity.  Danny's Place is one of those.  The pizza is NY style, great sauce and cheese.  We have tried the chicken parm and the eggplant parm (both excellent).  My son got to eat his first zeppole (yum).  Your products speaks for themselves.  Also, an owner who checks in on his customers and really gets to know them.  We would love to try your steamers when you have your first steamer night and a glass of wine for an upcoming date night. (Hint, hint) So glad you are 5 minutes from us.  Keep up the great work and we will see yas soon!  Jim, Amy and Luke Daniels",

BTW- our server was Alexis and she was great! She kept my kids entertained and provided excellent service. Highly recommend!",
