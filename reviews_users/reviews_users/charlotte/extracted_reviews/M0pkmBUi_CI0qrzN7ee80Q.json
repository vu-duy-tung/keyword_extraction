I went back to the bar and basically got called a liar. I went off, because I will not be called a liar. They did not provide me a receipt when I paid, and said that was the reason. I do not care. They finally made the drink just to get me to shut up. Glad for that. 20 minutes after consuming my creme brulee, I had dysentery. I'm am furious. I will never go back; I will discourage other people from going. That was absolutely unacceptable. If I could give a rating less than one, you bet your butt I would put a rating lesson one. You can't just play around with creme brulee, being a raw egg product, you have to make sure that your stuff is super fresh you're going to kill somebody. Absolutely livid. I have not been off the toilet since my visit. And I visited about four hours ago.",

    "text": "What a place!! Conveniently located in Uptown, Amelie's makes me excited to go to work in the morning if only for the coffee breaks. Provisions aside, this converted parking garage has an outrageously cool interior that delivers good vibes on the gloomiest of days. But the food and beverages served here are quite good too, making Amelie's a worthy place for a morning pit stop or afternoon pick-me-up.  Amelie's serves a variety of foods, including make-your-own breakfast sandwiches (highly recommend), quiches, and a variety of treats and pastries. Note that while hot food can sometimes take longer to come out during busier times (you can pick up the pastries and go), the options here are easily healthier and higher-quality than your typical fare from Starbucks and the like - where else can you choose from cheddar, asiago, mozzarella, gruyere, brie, and manchego as the cheese options for your breakfast sandwich?  On the drinks side, Amelie's serves a number of its own espresso creations, ranging from the potent (cafe capuchon, cafe glace) to the indulgent (cafe marcotter, cafe dauphine). I've tried both types and have had pleasant experiences both ways, so there is something for everyone here. Additionally, non-coffee drinkers need not feel excluded either as there is a \"les sans cafe\" and a cold drinks part of the menu that offers creations like french soda, a house-made lemonade, and hot chocolate drinks. It's hard to not find at least one thing you'll like here.  The service here is very pleasant and the store's decor gives you a lot to look at as you're waiting for your order. The prices don't break the bank either, and are definitely reasonable considering the quality. I always look forward to coming here!",

It is a fun bonus when you can watch the bakers baking in their large zoo-like encasement :) I bet they get use to people watching them but it's just funny.   If you go in the fall, get the apple cider!!! It's my favorite and I wish I could have it year round!",

This French bakery has the most amazing desserts and coffee on the planet. I love the French decor and the games and instruments strewn about. The absolute best things are the macaroons. Despite being a tad pricey (they're $2.50 a piece before taxes), they taste like God himself came down from Heaven to whip up a batch of Macaroons. I suggest the Pistachio (my favorite) and the Vanilla Buttercream. As for beverages, I'd suggest the Cafe Fouette. It's a sweet coffee drink that will make you fall in love with this place. All in all, this place is a home run and a must see if you have friends visiting the area.",

I wasn't too excited about it since I was not aware they served lunch but I decided it would be worth it if I could also get a macaroon. The menu is limited to about 6 sandwiches and usually 2 soups of the day. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant, no side. The soup was not appealing to me and I'm not a potato salad fan at all. The croissant was a decent a size and it was filled with a decent amount of chicken salad. The chicken in the chicken salad was big cubes of chicken but the whole thing was very flavorful and on the sweeter side. The croissant was buttery but was a little too flakey for my liking. I ended up eating with a fork because it became a mess. But overall I like the sand which I just wish there were more options for sides like baked chips or fresh fruit. Dessert never disappoints and the new location is great.",

I've had a hit & miss experience at their other locations & this was no different....although there were many more hits  Mushroom & onion quiche with Gruyere- crust was flakey but the quiche was dense & super flavorful. This is a repeat!  Twice baked Almond croissant - super moist & subtly almondy - repeat!  Pecan tart - this is a southern staple & these guys did it right. Tender crust & lots of buttery pecan throughout - repeat!  Macarons - even though most were raw on the inside, I was a fan in concept. Longer in the oven definitely required. Got 1 of each & here's the rundown  Jalapeno- weird flavor that tasted more gelatinous & half raw on inside  Basil-lime - raw but surprisingly nice compliment of flavor  Pistachio- subtle nut flavor  Raspberry little bit raw, real raspberry jam (seeds). Intense raspberry flavor  Salted caramel - this tasted like chocolate. No caramel taste. Wonder if it was mislabeled   Cinnamon ganache - CINNAMON. Just like biting into a cinnamon stick  Bourbon vanilla peach streusel - raw. Peach jam & maybe a slight cinnamon flavor to represent \"streusel\"  Mixed berry - dry with whole strawberry inside  Lemon - raw. No lemon taste  Milk chocolate passion fruit - bit raw but nice compliment of chocolate to passion fruit  Honey - my fav. Lovely honey aftertaste. Light creamy perfect crisp  Orange - very orange w a vanilla cream. Like a dreamsicle  So when traveling back to the Uptown area, you'd best believe there will be another ginormous box of Amelie's goodies!",

My only conclusion is that someone had just cut up a bunch of onions and did not change gloves. Regardless, the meal was ruined. I will be staying away for lunch but will go by if I need some cake or pastry.",

Everyone was sitting doing their own thing just enjoying the moment. I attempted to read the menu items in my French voice in my head, but they came out sounding more like Spanish...wished my son was there.  I ordered the Provence BLT for us to share, two palmiers because I hardly ever share sweets, and an iced coffee with vanilla (not sure of the French name).  I conveniently left the items in the car so that when we hopped in to begin his birthday weekend...\"Well whaddayaknow breakfast for our ride out to the vineyards!\" Needless to say, the BLT still tasted amazing. It hadn't become soggy or anything, he loved it! And those palmiers, the lady who took my order told me something about it being coated over and over in butter and sugar and I was sold. It was flakey and sweet and just plain yummy!  It was a perfect beginning to what was a perfect day and weekend!",

Yes, it's pricy, but yes, you're also paying for the atmosphere and the name. The pastries are delicious and the coffee was very good. I love the layout of the location - there's a section for each part of the store.  The location is wonderful, and there is plenty of parking, but just hope you get lucky to find one!  Grab some dessert and a coffee, take a seat, and watch some of the delicious foods being made.",

It's hard to decide which dessert when there are 3 cases to choose from and you can't see the selection until you are up there and they are waiting for your order! Pressure!  I had the salad with walnuts and I think feta, very good. Palmier, pear tart were yum! My husband had a BLT on a croissant and he liked it as well as his tomato soup. This will be our go to place when we come to Charlotte.",

As for food, their pastries are good but their cake-ier items can be dry and they have hard macarons.",

The hot chocolate and chai tea also delicious.   First and foremost, Arty the manager,  has superb customer service etiquette. I asked for a second slice of their delicious baguette to finish up my delicious soup. He gave me the entire long piece of their bread. It was closing time 10:00 pm and he gave me the entire bread. He didn't tell me, sorry we are closed. Instead, he took care of his customer. Luwan, took my order and she was also great at what she does. She smiled and did not seemed rushed even though it was almost closing time. It shows this place has a great manager.  I never brag about anyone. But, Amelie's deserves 10 stars plus. Great food, superb customer service and spotless bathrooms.   Thank you Arty for the warm experience.",

The fiance had brought me these amazing french macaroons from here for Valentine's Day. So ofcorse when he suggested why don't we go. I happily agreed. First you walk in and the place has several different seating areas/ nooks, each perfect in its own way... The decore is eclectic French-ish  hipster but in a cute way, not at all pretentious.   We went to the bakery case and I started drooling at the options. After much lamenting we settled on the Carmel pineapple macaroon, a mini coconut passion fruit chocolate cup and a jalapeno macaroon. My favorite was the jalapeno, it was this perfection of sweet but almost a hint of tangy.   We sat at the bar and decided why not order a glass of bubbly each too :). We were celebrating cuz he just got a job offer! So with out prosecco and desserts we had quite the festive afternoon.  This place is really great!! I'm glad I don't live here because I'd  probably weigh 500 pounds as I'm sure I'd find an excuse to celebrate something there on a weekly basis lol",

    "text": "Wow! This place definitely leaves an impression. When you walk in here, you will notice all the unique furnishing they have around the cafe (from umbrella lights, upside down tree lights, mona lisa with glasses painting, fake fireplaces, etc.).   You go up to the counter to order. They have a line for pastry but you can also come to this line if you're ordering something other than pastry. I was here two days in a roll because I was at a conference nearby. The first time I tried their bourbon peach and honey macarons (2 for about $5) for desserts. The honey macaron was definitely very delicious! The bourbon peach one was good too, but I liked the creamy filling in the honey macaron better compared to the jelly like filling in the bourbon peach macaron.   I was here again for lunch and tried the croque monsieur, lemon and raspberry mini tart, and coconut ginger cream chai. The croissant of the sandwich was great, very buttery and flaky, but the sandwich was on the salty side. I would recommend getting something else if you're ordering a sandwich. The mini tart is a great size if you don't want to ingest too many calories. I liked the tartness of the lemon filling and the crunchy tart shell. Lastly, the coconut ginger cream chai was a refreshing delicious drink. It sounds a bit weird, but you really don't taste too much of ginger, there is coconut flakes in the drink, and the spices in the chai aren't too overwhelming.   The only downside of this place is that it can be chaotic when they get busy. We waited probably 10 minutes at our table when a waitress came by to tell us they ran out of quiche (hmm, the cashiers at the ordering counter didn't know this?). They're suppose to have these cool table trackers, but this system doesn't seem to be working out too well for them. A lot of the waitresses were walking around yelling out numbers because they couldn't find the table with the order.   Chaos aside, I love the decorations in this place and the desserts are yummy!",

If you want anything from the pastry case + coffee get in the line along the case (furthest from the door). Service is very friendly, food is yummy (ate it too quick to get pictures). I had a blueberry muffin and a breakfast sandwich on a croissant with iced coffee. Everything was delicious! Plus there's TONS of seating so I was able to find a quiet space to do homework.

The decor and overall ambiance of Amelie's is fun and chic! I just couldn't stop looking around at all of the incredible chandeliers and knick knacks. We tried the salted caramel brownies first. Heaven. That's the only way to describe it!!! The caramel is homemade and should be on every single pasty or dessert. I need more of it in my life. We also had a sample of the artichoke leek soup, which was savory and delightful. I tried the giant Napolean pastry, and needed to take half home. The cream was fluffy and lite, with the bits of chocolate and vanilla snuck in there for extra deliciousness. My husband had a breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg, monchego, and Asiago on a croissant. He quickly and happily devoured it! I'm so glad that we found this place and we will definitely be bringing our families and friends here to visit!",

My sister had the bread pudding which was filled with coconut, raisins, and pecans. That was to die for, they serve it warm which it takes a minute to heat up, but still worth  the wait!  Their prices on pastries weren't bad the highest priced items were their bigger items like the muffins for around/close to $5. The decor in the shop was very unique, there wasn't one thing the same.  The shops tables and chairs are vintage and so are the decorations. Overall it's a great place to go to study or have desert.  Plus they are open 24/hrs! Would defiantly go back and try something different!",

    "text": "I chanced upon this delightful bakery and cafe while in Charlotte for a P.E.O. convention. First of all, the decor is eclectic and charming. The first evening, we sat outside at little tables that truly made it feel like you were at a Parisian street cafe. Delightful. I had a soup that was light but filling at the same time. I think it was spinach, leek, and asparagus. So tasty! Dessert was a tough choice as the display cases are loaded with rows of beautifully presented pastries and sweet treats. The peach tart I settled on was fantastic. Flaky and full of peach flavor. Before flying out this morning, my friends and I planned to have breakfast at our hotel - until we saw the uninspired menu and typically jacked up prices. On a hunch, we decided to check to see if Amelie's would be open, though we held out little hope, as we'd been told all of downtown closes on Sundays. Turns out my new favorite place is open twenty four hours a day, every day. Awesome! My friend and I both had different flavors of quiche. Mine was asparagus and manchego cheese - hers bacon and some other kind of cheese. I don't even normally order quiches in restaurants because I hate when they come out in a runny consistency. Not to worry here - the quiches were amazing. The staff is ready to help with any questions or needs. They are friendly and professional. In between eating all the delicious, excellently prepared foods it's just plain fun to look around and see all the whimsical decorating touches. Amelie's, can you branch out to Kansas City???????",

You can watch the bakers in action through the glass. Pretty cool. When it comes to any Amelie's, you really can't go wrong with anything you order. Some of my absolute favorites: pate (I get it without bread), salted caramel brownies, any of the tartines, spinach asparagus leek soup (hell, any of the soups really), macarons. They do a really great job with seasonal menus as well. Unlike the flagship store in NoDa, this one also serves alcoholic bevvies. *pops bottle*  If you work uptown, this is a great place to grab coffee or eats. I like to do meetings here and then stay after for a couple hours to get some work done. If you're not already in the area, be prepared that you will have to pay to park somewhere.

Check out the tree in the corner that's hanging upside down from the ceiling. Coolness.  5 stars - Paris blend iced tea with vanilla syrup added, just lightly sweetened. The tea is brewed on the spot. This tea blend came recommended from one of the staff members. Spot on flavor and the aroma was a terrific balance of floral and bold.   5 stars - Butter croissant. It was so good I came back two days in a row just for that croissant. It's crispy on the outside and flaky soft on the inside. Just what you'd want. And a treat because it was a generous size for a bakery croissant.   Paris tea and a butter croissant please. That'll be what I order when I come back. Then I'll find a seat under that tree to soak in the ambience.",

This place offers French food, amazing pastries, and a large selection of coffees/espresso beverages, and other types of drinks. The drinks I had here were better than any other coffee I had in Charlotte. I truly fell in love with this place and I wish this existed in my hometown because I would be there all the time.

Food was a poor imitation of French food and I was very unimpressed. It seems that they interpret French food as put a ton of butter in everything. 2 stars for food. The woman at cashier was unhelpful and rolled her eyes when I asked questions as it was my first time there.  I got the soup which was bland, salt less and had oil floating on top. I got the fig and Brie open face sandwich. There were no figs-- rather, gobs of extremely sweet jam (couldn't tell if fig or not) and 2 thin slices of Brie on a piece of toast saturated with butter.   The pastries look good, I got a tart, the crust was too hard, the meringue topping overly sweet, and stingy on the lemon filling. Not sure if I just ordered the wrong things but I would not go back unless I just wanted a cute place to sit and have a drink. Would not recommend ordering food here.",

The cotton candy flavor didn't taste like cotton candy, the mix berry was very rich in flavor. I have to give them 5 stars because of the consistency of the texture beneath the crust.  It was the perfect chewy texture but had the crunch factor on the outside.  The filling was proportionate to the cookie.  I have tried a lot of macarons in various places that I have traveled within the US and outside in Europe and UK..this by far was the best macaron I have tried (in the states) that is comparable to the ones I've had in Paris. It was spot on.",

You can't go wrong with the fan-favorite Salted Caramel Brownies, right?! They'll love it that much they'll have to practice some self-control, or you'll be blamed for their addiction. (P.S available in gluten-free!) You'd like the casual, unorthodox and cluttered decor with the untraditional lamps and interesting chandeliers.  Personally, other than the salted caramel brownie, I can barely resist the flaky layers of the Napoleon. On the savory side, I like the Roast Beef Croissant. I'm pretty sure that charming Parisian girl named Amelie would have loved their Cafe au lait as much as I do.  Five Yelps.",

I had a salmon crepe in beurre blanc sauce, a fancy sparkling lemonade, pecan tart and brought home an assortment of macarons.  The salmon crepe was 10 stars of deliciousness and an another 10 stars for presentation.  The salmon was broiled to perfection, giving it a very juicy center along with a slight crunch on the outside  excellent!.

    "text": "What a darling venue.  It is very Fraunshhhh inside.  I like the lighting and the wall decor.  The way they decorated actually kinda makes me think of the movie \"Amalie\" (although maybe I just made that up in my head because of the name).    So I had the \"Marie Antoinette\" which was a cream cheese pastry with a raspberry jam on top.  Rich, but not too sweet.  I also had a ham and gruyere tartine, which was very savory.  Both of these I got to-go, because I had just eaten lunch and I wasn't sure if I'd feel like getting out of my comfy hotel bed later on.  (I was right. Future me was grateful.)    I must have arrived right before the lunch rush.  It got bussssssy fast, like right after I got my food.  Good timing.",

    "text": "From the time you lay eyes on this little French haven you'll feel as if you're in France (literally). Then you walk inside and become completely engulfed in French inspired decor from towers similar to Eiffel, baker's in those tall puffy white hats tossing dough around in the glass window of the pastry kitchen, bonjour paintings, gold furnishings, candelabras and a salivating. The bakery case is filled with all kinds of delicious goodies: eclairs, cakes, muffins, brownie bars and the most beautiful macaroons EVER. I couldn't help but order one of each flavor:  Mixed berry Egg nog Raspberry  Orange  Salted caramel  Vanilla bean Honey butter cream  Pistachio  Lemon Salted caramel brownie  Espresso  I wish I could say any single macaroon was better than another but truth is they were all splendid. In the mood for a light snack I ordered a goat cheese brioche (warmed) along with the latte of the day; Hazelnut Praline. It was so gorgeous I didn't want to drink it in an attempt to preserve its presentation. It was even topped with sweet praline crumbs. The brioche was excellent, just enough goat cheese to compliment to crispy sweet puff pastry. Once my sweet tooth wore off I went back a couple hours later for lunch with a few dining partners. Their orders ranged from croissant sandwich to the Pick 2 option, consisting of 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad, I opted for the Spinach & Mushroom crepe with side salad. All portions were small (typical for a French bakery) but very tasty. If you're looking for a meal that will fill you up this isn't it however, it is definitely worth stopping in for a healthy portion of quality food.    ~Christy",

We chose Amelie's as we have heard nothing short of rave reviews and only had a short time to grab a bite before the show. Everything on the menu sounded delightful and we had a hard time choosing! We finally chose the Croque Monsieur and on of the daily quiches. (broccoli cheddar).   I'll be honest that I was less than impressed when we received our food. Our quiche looked and tasted as though it had been reheated several times and a piece of cheese was laid across the top to make it appear 'fresh'.   The Croque Monsieur was lack luster in that the croissant wasn't up to the standards we have heard of. It tasted stale and almost store bought. The ham inside was nothing extraordinary and honestly was on the bland side. However, the mustard had a great flavor but I highly doubt there is any left in the kitchen. It was ALL on the sandwich.   We are so disappointed in our experience at this location. Totally not expected and for a company that gets rave reviews. I hope that our experience was a fluke and we are willing to try again but it may be a while before that happens.",

Whether stopping in for a meeting and coffee or enjoying a glass of wine after work with a salted caramel brownie, this is the place to be. The place is huge and has tons of seating as well as a great outdoor patio I love to sit in and people watch. The service is always friendly and the desserts make me feel like I've stepped into a European bakery. If stopping in for lunch, this is a great place for a light sandwich and soup, but isn't the best spot if you're looking for big portions. The breakfast sandwiches are delightful. I love the uptown location because you can watch the staff create all of the delicious desserts that you serve. I am telling you NOT to get a window seat if you are on a diet. One look at the salted caramel being swiped over the tin of brownies and I'm DONE. The macaroons are delicious and the perfect amount of chewy and light. The only thing I would call out to the staff is it would be great if the staff could label the kinds of macaroons. It gets old in line hearing the poor staff member recite each flavor over and over. Sure, yellow is easy to imagine would be lemon, but do you know how many potential flavors light brown macaroons could be? Cappuccino? Chocolate? Spicy hot chocolate?   The only reason I gave a four instead of 5 stars is because the bathrooms aren't always the cleanest. Which is shocking! This is the Uptown location of professionals and tourists. It's a bit surprising that it is not kept in top shape for a gorgeous French bakery!",

The design is both Parisian and eclectic, featuring coffee, pastries, cafe food, and even lunch and wine. They've got open seating varying between tables and couches to give you that cozy coffee shop feeling. They've got bar seating, and even give you a view into the bakery with a large window.   I ordered the cafe mocha, fruit Danish pastry, almond cake, raspberry lemon tart, and mixed fruit tart. The pastries were all tasty and fresh, and the cafe mocha had a nice deep chocolate flavor. Although the prices were on the expensive side, I think the location, atmosphere, and quality may warrant it.   If you're in the area in search of your caffeine fix or for a place to relax, maybe pass up that Starbucks or convenience store coffee, and give them a try.",

I had gotten the bag of coffee for my boyfriend who didn't like the taste. He even tried multiple methods of brewing it... Nespresso, French press... but it still came out sour.  Disappointed because I was visiting Charlotte and had heard great things about this bakery!",

The lighting & chandeliers (cue Sia and that creepy little dancer) still managed to convey a sense of intimacy. Found a corner with a view of the kitchen and sipped my beverage watching all the pastry making unfold. The staff joyfully baked and prepped, laughing and joking with each other. They appeared so engaged and delighted in their work! Though I couldn't hear them, for some reason, \"bibbitty bobbitty boo\" played in my head.  I skipped ordering a pastry, while the nice young woman at the counter kept insisting I try one of the many varieties of macarons. I declined, and on another note, they seem to be the darling dessert of the moment. All of a sudden, they're everywhere! They're okay, but I don't get it. What's so great about macarons?",

UPDATE (7/28): The manager here has an amazing story, if you're ever lucky enough to meet Ryan, get him to tell you his story. The employees here are some of the kindest people I've met. After a strange set of circumstances, one employee gave me free macarons and a salted caramel brownie and I was blown away with their kindness.

We just moved to the area a few months ago and decided to start our day date tradition back up again now that we're all settled. Since I'm originally from the area, I knew of Amelie's so we made it the first stop. Huge mistake. The server was rude and couldn't have cared less about customer service. I asked for an iced version of one of their coffees and she refused completely. I asked for the regular version and a cup of ice but no luck so i settled for water. We ordered a creme brulee and they didn't want to torch it so we had to talk them into it and I wish they would've let us do it because it wasn't done right. The other pastries were okay, nothing great but nothing terrible and my wife was satisfied with her coffee.  I've never been in a coffee shop that made me say \"we should've just gone to Starbucks\" until today. At least their staff tries to help you find something close to what you're looking for.",

They literally just melted in my mouth.   I definitely will be back again to try more flavor and cannot wait to try the other food here too.

The lines, unlike the Noda location, travel fast and main hall is very spacious. I ordered multiple macaroons, they were oh so soft and yummy. I have had a problem with the Noda location's macaroons, they can be rock hard for some reason and cold, I suspect they are made a day before and placed in the fridge, bad move. I also ordered a chicken salad croissant, it had good flavor but the chicken chunks were huge.  I was a little disappointed to find the baguettes were smaller than the Noda location, I paid 3.95 for one full baguette, I will only be buying these from the Noda location from now on. The baguette was also not as fresh as I had hoped.   I have only gotten one drink from here and will continue to keep coming back for it, the cafe marcotter (MAR-KO-TAY) is delicious. I like to make it a little lighter with almond milk, they do not have skim.   We will be back for more! Cheers!",

We also got fruit tarted and peach tartes. I'm in town for a week and have been there a few times now to get pastry and lunch. The baguettes are sublime. The honey Dijon sandwich is excellent with the crunchy apple. The soups are made there and they always have a special quiche for the day. There is so much to choose from and i definitely recommend the Paris tea. I enjoy to sit outside. It gets busy for lunch but the line moves. The strawberry salad with goat cheese and carmalized almonds is also a delicious choice with the balsamic dressing. I honestly look forward to going back each day. This place speaks to my soul. There is a panera across the street and i can't understand why people are even eating there as opposed to eating at Amelie's everyday. Go to Amelie's, try all different things and take your time.

It was a Thursday morning at 9:45 AM & there was a line to the door & two people working the register. I just don't feel like there's much efficiency.   Yummy treats, delicious coffee & sandwich offerings make them a popular spot. I ordered a sausage, egg & mozzarella croissant sandwich & a coffee (as I write this on Monday, I've totally forgotten what it was ). I took it back to my office to eat & drink. Everything was delicious. Portion size, taste & temperature was A+.  It's pretty pricey here, but pleased with what you get for what you pay.  The inside is spacious, lots of room to sit & eat, drink, work, visit. It can be pretty loud though.",

Due to the fact there is a line for pastries and food items they definitely direct you accordingly, in addition, for take out or pick up orders they have a designated area for that.

There are comfortable couches throughout the interior that give a very homey and inviting vibe, with interesting and humorous artwork.   There is a bakery line and food line, both of which move quickly and allow for a streamlined check out. I got the soup of the day (tomato fennel) and wild mushroom tartine (open faced sandwich). My one complaint is that the sandwich was a bit cold, but warmed right up when dipped in soup! Also tried one of the salted caramel brownies which was AMAZING. What a great combination of salty and sweet, can definitely see why it's one of their most popular items.   They had samples of their other pastry items out on the counter and after trying those I can definitely say I'll be back for more!",

Fine... i'll change my order, but hard for pregnant woman to change her cravings... just saying. So then I saw the apple tart, but instead it was a pear tart that was in the apple tart's place. So not wanting to be super difficult, I went with the pear tart with the flaky, buttery crust.. It was a delicious dessert - could have been easily shared, but who would want to do that.   You will have to order at the counter  - this place is a bakery/restaurant/cafe. It is decorated so eclectically but the furniture in the restaurant is a little worn.",

I'm not sure I like this one as much as the Rock Hill location (at this point I'd say they're about equal), but I definitely prefer it to the NoDa location. A friend of mine recommended it and I met up with him here to catch up. I had a chocolate dessert which was a bit too dense, but otherwise tasty as hell. Everything else in the glass case looks good so I think I'll give it another go-round to try some other things. It's a cute multi-level cafe with a Parisian theme, which I love. It's also spacious, yet cozy. I'm not too crazy about having to pay for parking as I don't live uptown, although I do enjoy using the light rail to get there from north Charlotte. Overall, my whole take is that it's charming enough to make multiple trips for meeting up with friends. Bon appetit!",

You can tell this is True because of the way their signs are and the way their velvet ropes are lined up to help guide people. They sell food, coffee, and pastries that include fruit tarts, cakes, macarons, etc. I tried a pear tart, a mixed fruit tart with custard, and a few other pastries. They're pretty expensive. You can get similar tarts like that in other places for cheaper (I don't know about other places in Charlotte). This place stands out because of their open bakery (you can see people baking behind glass walls) and their unique decoration and theme. Inside, they have an upside down fake tree that is lit up with Christmas lights, a cardboard cut out of Napoleon, old-century French touches, and a dim atmosphere. The chairs are unique and the overall vibe of this place is very artsy.",

The moment you walk into this cafe - before you even see the food - the whimsy decor will make you fall in love. It's the epitome of a \"cute cafe\"! Perfect for your Instagram! The space is huge, by the way. It's a converted parking garage so it has two levels which are both big with lots of comfy seating (French cafe style tables, soft couches, and big tables for groups). Be warned, though: you may still have trouble finding seating during lunch hours :)  Now for the food. It's so good. Fresh and distinctly French. I usually opt for a sandwich, many of which are served warm. My favorite is turkey and brie, but all of them are good. They're served on baguette, which is crispy crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside (the best way!). And don't miss the bakery/pastry section! The macarons are divine.  Overall, Amelie's is a staple of my Uptown lunch faves. Go check it out if you're looking for some quick French food and decor that will brighten your day!",

Seating is first come, first serve so make sure you scout out a good table as soon as you walk in. As far as food goes, I highly recommend the open faced sandwiches or any of the pastries!",

It's definitely a place where you can catch up with friends and just talk all day or maybe even a dessert place after a date. I went around 7pm on a Friday, so it wasn't crazy at all. They have French pastries and desserts, coffee, alcoholic beverages, and a small food menu. BF and I got two desserts, mines was the chocolate mousse it was delicious. We sat there for an hour just eating our desserts and talking. It was super quiet with students studying around us or playing board games.",

Today my co-worker friend was not here, and I was eating alone at the bakery with my food. I was the only African American in my section (and the bakery as far as I could tell), eating alone, and I was doing nothing but eating and researching stocks on my phone, enjoying my lunch break like everyone else. 25 minutes, I get a tap on my shoulder from some guy telling me that I had to leave because I had food with me. Mind you I eat in here at least twice a week WITH food with my friend (who happens to be Caucasian), and I constantly notice others who do the same thing. I though it was a normal thing to do, I'm not bothering anyone and I am a patron. I was immediately turned off by this pointless discrimination, but I left without raising a fuss, acknowledging the rules of a private establishment, even though most coffee shops serve as a public getaways/meeting place's/Relaxation zones. Safe to say that will be my last time walking through the doors of Amelie's and giving my business to a place that doesn't want any type of African American male filling up it seats without a white counterpart or an expensive, over-toasted, croissant.",

    "text": "This is my 2nd Amelie's venture outside of their original NODA location.  The first (Pineville Matthews Rd) wasn't that great.  This time I visited their \"new\" College St location in Uptown Charlotte.  It, too, had its disappointments.  While the interior was fantasticly designed, the lines to order aren't so fantasticly designed.  I also think they need to hire additional staff (or reassign them during shifts.)    Only two cash registers were open.  We stood in a relatively short (5-6) people line for about 20 minutes just to get a frickin' chocolate croissant. There were two (bored) employees behind the pastry counter because everyone was ordering food and drinks other than pastries. After 10 minutes, I finally got up to the pastry counter and ordered my chocolate croissant from the sparse pastry display case (it was only about noonish).  I then had to wait another 10 minutes -- croissant in hand -- to pay for it.  As we were (finally) walking away with the croissant, one of the cashiers (mind you, there's only two) ran across the room saying she'd be right back.   A lot of tables were empty, yet most of these empty tables were dirty.  (Here's an idea: how about sending one of the bored pastry people out on a quick run to wipe down tables?  Or adding additional staff?)   Where's the management for this establishment?  It doesn't seem like it's managed very well to provide top quality, efficient service.    While the croissant was good, was it worth standing in line for 20 minutes and sitting at a semi-dirty table?  Um...no.",

    "text": "Love this place! They have the most interesting, eclectic decor! It's fun to look around and spot cool stuff. The menu is simple, their soups and quiches of the day haven't changed the 5-6 times that I've been here. The potato leek soup is good, it's different because it's not pureed like I'm used to. Their seasonal tartine is good but couldn't really taste the potato puree but you could taste the truffle. The roast beef and manchego has a good amount of beef in it and is pretty tasty!  Chicken salad croissant isn't the classic chicken salad because it has big chunks of chicken in it but is a good option nonetheless! The chocolat chaud is basically hot chocolate but not sickly sweet and I really enjoyed it!! The chocolate croissants are good, but I've had nicer ones. The salted caramel bar is delicious and the espresso gateaux is superb if you wait for it to warm up to room temperature to enjoy the buttercream!",

They have a huge space with lots of natural light, exposed ductwork, and a cement floor. There is light coloring on the walls and the decor is very funky, a bit of a mix of Alice in Wonderland meets Louis the XIV. The main bakery area sits behind a big glass window, giving you a look into the delicious pastry creation. Their baguette is on point, crusty on the outside, fluffy in the middle, served with sweet cream butter and a little jam, magnifique. A rainbow of macaroons and very chocolatey and dense brownies are also among their specialty. Eat in, take out, either way, falling down this Parisian rabbit hole is worth a trip.",

Today, February 24th at 5:14 PM, Arty or Artie provided the worse customer service I have ever experienced.   I am not sure if it was directed towards my boyfriend and I because we were gay (which I strongly feel it was because this is not my first time being discriminated against) or if he would have acted differently if he was not having a bad day. However, I am in customer service and know that the comment he made with a derogatory connotation is unacceptable. We were simply having a laugh and being playful, as his own co-worker Nathan witnessed. Moreover, even after his demeaning comment, his own co-worker agreed with us that he was not joking and being serious for no reason.   I will not be coming back to this location because of Arty/Artie's actions.",

The coffee torte was not available so I asked the driver to pick up something coffee flavored.   He brought back the first two items and then a beautiful layered cake of sorts that seemed to have some coffee flavored cream in between the layers of sponge.  I have to say, I was kind of disappointed. The Eclair was ok but didn't taste fresh and the coffee \"cake\" definitely wasn't fresh, it had that \"been in the cold case for a couple of days\" flavor. I didn't try the Napoleon but my coworker said it was good.  The sizes of all the sweets were large enough to share between two people but I still find them to be on the pricey side. Those 3 items alone where almost $16 (no I am not including the delivery fee from Favor).   Next time, I will have to go in person to see what moves the most and try something that tastes like it was made that day.",

We were just passing through Charlotte, so it's unlikely I'll be there again, but if I ever am in town, I'm definitely stopping by for a meal, or at least some pastries!",

It's such a delightful French style Bakery with amazing pastries and tasty sandwiches. The  croque monsieur is one of the best I've ever had, and their chicken salad on a fresh croissant I've had many of times for lunch and  It's really enjoyable. However a visit to Amelie's for me always include ending my meal with a salted caramel brownie decadence on another level. The  Amelie's in Noda stays open 24 hours and I have utilized those hours many of times so I suggest that you go and discover what you like. From French coffees, to delicious pastries and sandwiches breakfast and lunch are both great times to go. If it's your first time going it can be overwhelming the pastries of many different assortment that's in the case can be mind-blowing. I suggest you take a deep breath look at all the choices before you start to order the staff is friendly and very accommodating they very knowledgeable about the delicious food that they serve. Don't be shy to ask.",

Walking into Amelie's feels like walking into a (very large) French cafe.  The food is freshly made and delicious, especially the breakfast sandwiches and salted caramel brownies.  And, the espresso drinks were great; in particular, the cafe marcotter was amazing!  The atmosphere is very nice and the place is huge, so you'll always have somewhere to sit.  Definitely worth checking out.",

Everything so far I have tied is out of this world...and they dont stop at desserts, try their soup or sandwiches. I have only had one rude staff person since coming here and well he will not last long . We always bring people there from the airport to make the trip worth making . What to try, its all good, just order away...and dont leave if there is a line. I see so many leave and thing..bad move",

The croissant was just the way it should be, just the right amount of buttery and flaky, loved taking one home. I ordered a cafe au lait, although they call it another name, and that was made just perfectly. My quiche was fantastic, the crust was crisp and tender all at once.   The hubs had a breakfast sandwich, at first they brought him out the wrong thing, then very quickly went back to correct it and he had his sandwich. His sandwich was served on a croissant, yum! It was huge, definitely too much of an indulgence for every day.   This is a great breakfast stop, or drop in and get a few pastries to go from their vast selection in the pastry case.",

This spot is known for their specialty lemonades. So I had to order a lavender lemonade with my vegetable quiche.   The place is quite cute and quirky at the same time. Cute with French decor and cool lighting fixtures but quirky with a modern bar area and lots of interesting seating options. The cafe is quite large not what you would expect when you think French cafe. I picked up my lemonade drink at the bar...it was delicious. Then we sat on some nice arm chairs with a side table between us. It took about 15 minutes to get our food. The quiche was okay. Overall it was a good spot but not too impressed with what I ordered.   I am up for giving this another try for lunch or even try breakfast. The pastries looked very tasty. Next time I will go early for lunch and hope to avoid some of the crowd.",

    "text": "I'm giving this location a two star because the few times I've been there (morning, night, late night, afternoon) I've always gotten mediocre drinks/food. If you've been to the NODA location you expect pricey baked goods and tiny cups of coffee for the same price as a normal human-sized cups of coffee; you expect that. What you don't expect is burned- tasting coffee, hard macaroons, and food that barely deserves the name. I know they have trained staff properly but it sure does not show up in the product.   The staff are normal Amelie's staff; the cashiers are bored, baristas are harried/ rude, bakery counter is goofing around but they're not the issue here. The issue is that every single time I've gone in, the TIMES OF OPERATION are totally different. Whether it's because they've just opened or it's the weekend or some other reason, it's never the same. Continuity, folks, continuity. That's all I want.   The space is great, love the decor especially the light fixtures, and I think they did a wonderful job transforming the space.",

I loved how there was ample seating in the shop for large groups of people to talk and socialize. They have a wide selection of pastries, as well as regular food.   I got an apple tart and peach tart since they looked really good in the case. I paid around $10 for both tarts, and was unfortunately disappointed by their taste. While the apple tart tasted fine, it was slightly hard and stale. I couldn't even eat 1/3 of the peach tart since the flavor was just off, and it was also hard and stale.  I heard their other dishes and pastries were better, so I probably just had bad luck with the apple and peach tarts. Might be back to try their other items!",

The chocolate eclair we got was also perfect! We also ordered the lavender honey soda which was so interesting. You can definitely taste both flavors and it would be refreshing for a hot summer day. It also wasn't like your typical soda and super sweet, so if you like the normal stuff then this might not be the drink for you. The reason I took a star off was because of the amount of single use plastic the store used! You would think for the prices that they could afford to use real spoons/forks/cups. Everything other than the plate with our baked goods was single use plastic- for our \"for here\" order. Not a big difference then between eating there and taking out. I hope they can reduce their plastic use in the future. Otherwise, the food was amazing!",

All the employees were super polite. The restaurant was spotlessly clean. I didn't feel rushed to make a decision at either the drink counter, or the bakery case, like normal bakeries push you along down the line. We spent a total of $15, and it's was the best $15 I've ever spent. So good, we are craving it just one day later! 100% reccomend! A MUST try if you're in the Charlotte Uptown area!",

Most servers/cashiers are knowledgeable about their menus and are willing to tell customers what they have available. Service wise, the first time experience could have been much better. As for the food, it was mediocre at best. Nothing to rave about...including the deserts. First time in the city and last time at this restaurant.",

I have tried birthday cake, wild berry, salted caramel, chocolate and mocha. Not only do they have macaroons but they also have a variety of pastries, sandwiches and soups. I would definitely recommend trying this establishment! There are two locations one in uptown which closes at 12 and the other location stays open 24 hours.",

    "text": "After watching The Most Incredible Thing on two different days, a ballet at the Knight Theater, we headed over to Amelie's Cafe both times. The cafe is a couple of blocks away and is easy to walk to.  The first time was after opening night, so it was likely around 22:00 when we arrived. It was busy. I ended up reserving a table for us by plopping our coats and my purse on our three comfy chairs. I didn't do any ordering, but I wanted the iced lavender drink with honey.  Both my friends came back about fifteen minutes later. The lineup was long. An older man with his date joked that he'd come sit with me. I had a snappy comeback which made them both laugh.  They came back with my beverage. They also got the following: - Petit fours, consisting of chocolate mousse, lemon, chocolate strawberry cups, and pistachio - Strawberry rhubarb almond cake - Vanilla strawberry cheesecake  They joined me at the table. We chatted and shared all the decent, scrumptious desserts. Like the first time at this cafe in Rock Hill, everything I had was divine. They weren't overly sweet. They were perfect.  It was during our stay at this cafe that we booked our tickets to the ballet the following afternoon. My friend did the booking and I offered to charge it to my credit card. Ah, teamwork!  After the matinee show on Sunday, we went for a late lunch first, and then decided to hit this cafe again. We thought of having a movie night at the hotel, and indulge in pastries and more together.  I was fortunate to participate in selecting goodies for us. Collectively, we got the following: - Bread pudding - Napoleon - Two key lime tarts - Dark chocolate raspberry tart  I am not a huge fan of the Napoleon to begin with. One of my friends ordered it, which was huge. I ended up being stuck with the remaining piece after they both headed home. I loved everything else. Nothing was left, except the bread pudding. I actually brought it back to Markham and ate it! It had chocolate mixed in, which was so yummy.  This bakery has a cafe in Rock Hill, SC; and another in Atlanta, GA. The remaining locations are in Charlotte, which is another good reason to return for a future visit.  If you are ever in Charlotte, I recommend coming here to either chat, have a cup of coffee, or get dessert to take with you. It's all good no matter what you do.  (137)",

I've toyed with getting the chicken salad before, but I was told that the secret ingredient is powdered sugar so I thought it might be a tad too sweet for me.

    "text": "A friend really wanted to go here for lunch while we were in town for a conference, and the biggest issue was finding the place.  We ended up going in through an office building, not realizing that the main entrance was around the corner.  I did appreciate the large roped-off area for the lines to order, with bakery and cafe split up, but at prime lunchtime, the cafe line was staffed by one cashier who, while nice, seemed new.  So the line moved veeeery slowly.  We also had some confusion about what to do with the buzzers, since it seemed like we were being told to stack them on some sort of thing on the table -- except that we didn't see anything like that outside.  Overall, very confusing.  I was pleasantly surprised at what seemed like pretty low prices, but as it turns out, the portion sizes are quite small.  My Provence BLT was on a croissant that was crumbling to pieces in my hands (over toasted, maybe) with approximately 2 pieces of bacon on it.  The seasonal truffle and thyme potato salad was decent, but could have used salt (I wasn't about to go look for it...), and all in all, $8 for lunch seemed a bit steep based on what I actually got.  However, the restaurant itself is quite large and very beautiful.  We enjoyed a perfect day to sit outside.  And, most impressively, I happened to be with a genuine Frenchman, who said that the pate was very good and the baguette tasted just like they do in France (rather than our US imitations, apparently).  So while I don't think I would go back for lunch, I have to give Amelie's the benefit of the doubt.  The desserts did look amazing, so maybe someday I'll be able to stop back for a pastry and coffee.",

Amelie's is a smallish bakery located on a quiet corner in Charlotte, near the Convention Center. There is quite a bit of seating space (2 bars, three different rooms and outdoor space) and a few options to order based on your preference.   In a hurry? Try the separate lines for food / coffee / pastries Riding solo? Post up at the bar tops and get access to everything. PRO TIP: skip the lines by ordering at the bar Hot date? There's tables and couches galore, based on your 'angle'... ;)  While there, you definitely need to get their caramel toffee brownie (they have a gluten free variety too!). Coffee is good as well. I had the egg and cheese sandwich which was light yet filling, and with some hot sauce is really good for breakfast.   All in all, I recommend stopping in Amelie's if you're in Charlotte, at a minimum for the caramel brownies.",

The frosting was in a clunk, I poked it to try and it just fell straight off the cake. Seriously for this price, I was expecting much more. I am not sure if all cakes made at Amelie are this dry, because my friend said she tried a piece of the strawberry round cake and it was also very dry.  The blueberry and lavender cold drink was good, but it was just crushed blueberry with sugared water. $3. Free wifi here, a lot of space and the upper floor can be rented out for an event. Outdoor seating.",

More impressive is the sweets case! Gorgeous and delicious! Chocolate eclairs are to die for and the cappuccino is amazing. Service was super friendly and the guy behind the counter was very helpful in aiding me to make up my mind what to get. Don't miss this dog- friendly spot with wonderful baked goods. Coming back for that bread pudding!!!",

The layout of this one is brilliant, you can see the pastries and baked good while waiting in line so you see and think about what you want before you're up to order. There's a second separate line for just ordering coffee and non bakery items.  The food and coffee are excellent. If you're new to Amelie's I recommend (like everybody else) the salted caramel brownie and the macaroons.  There's a reason everybody says that, they're delicious!  I've also had the quiche and loved it.  I'm sipping on an iced salted caramel coffee and loving that as well.  Now make this location 24 hrs and I'll give it 6 stars.",

We arrived here after picking my mom from the airport about a 20 min drive depending on traffic and stop lights. Once we got inside we ordered the famous Carmel brownies,macaroons, almond tea cakes, and several other beautifully crafted petite fours to eat and take with us on the journey back home today. As for the food I ordered the delightful croque massieur forgive me if I spelled that wrong but it's basically a croissant w ham and cheese that's my way of explaining the simplified version of the dish. Very very good make sure you try it as soon as possible. But getting back to the bakery, after ordering are dishes we sat in the back at a large table just enjoying the decor anticipating a great breakfast. We all loved what we had to eat and can't wait to return !",

I walk back and was told they were out of it-I got charged. The cashier was happy to remedy it but with only 30 mins for lunch, no thanks.

My egg sandwich and coffee got cold at my table while I waited in line watching the painfully slow bakery counter clerk fumble expensive pastries into boxes.   Three cashiers with no one in their line stood around watching the bakery line grow.  Finally a cashier gave in and put on some gloves to help out.  The batter in the muffin that caused the confusion had pockets of unmixed ingredients.  The good news is, good management could improve things, but the employees need to step it up, realizing that they are there to help unfamiliar guests.",

Their service is amazing. Such a chill, friendly, and positive environment. Tonight  the cashier sparked conversation since there wasn't anyone waiting in line and in the middle of conversation i noticed I had left my wallet home. Embarrassed, I apologized and asked to suspend my order...he picked up my tab with a smile and my family and I enjoyed our night. So thankful for this place.",

    "text": "As a native of CLT, I can say I've visited multiple Amelie's locations, probably more than I'd care to admit & recommended it to many people over the years. I was ecstatic when they opened right across from my work in Uptown. Unfortunately, I have to say the quality of food & customer service at the this location has significantly declined. This morning was the fourth time in a row I was disappointed. My breakfast sandwich had the bare minimum of ingredients (so little cheese I actually had to check after a few bites) & also cold- it was not busy so not sure why. The other times I've visited lately, the sandwiches I had were subpar at best, one even had bacon that was pretty burnt- had to pick it off to eat. As far as customer service, the baristas are on their own time. After waiting 25 minutes the other night for a quick coffee, I had them change my order to tea & just ate the price difference, so I could just get a hot drink & go, as I had somewhere to be & couldn't continue to wait around. Perhaps they should focus on their job instead of chatting with other employees. This is not the quality I'm used to from Amelie's nor worth the price, which I hate to say. Amelie's, I'll always visit for your sweets but please work on maintaining the high quality of food & service that we've come to expect instead of expanding into new locations!",

Cashiers and coffee makers stand there & chat with each other when customers are standing waiting! Or out if 3 cashier counters only 1 is working! They take their sweet time making coffee too! This is NOT a service oriented business. The management needs to do a better job of training their stuff to do their job in Timely and Friendly manner instead of treating customers as if doing them a favor!   You guys are surrounded by bankers who don't have a lot of time to stand around & waiting till the staff finish their chit chat!",

Both times I visited the Uptown location, I moved in a really slow line. The NoDa location is often busier and the line moves faster there.",

I got the quiche of the day (ham and cheddar) and a cup of the soup of the day (spinach, asparagus and leek). The quiche was not very warm and I couldn't really taste any ham or cheese and the soup was a milk/butter broth with 3 spinach leaves and one carrot floating in it. Boyfriend got the croque monsieur-- which was very tasty-- just not a lot for a $9 sandwich. His summer stew soup was just mediocre as well and none of our meal was very warm.   The salted caramel brownies though.. those are good. We got two of the salted caramel mochas and a creme brulee french soda as well. The soda was delicious and interesting! Must try!   I guess people mainly come for the dessert and coffee-- which is what I will be doing from now on.",

You could spend hours exploring every corner of this place, finding delight in the details.   The ordering process was a little confusing, as there are separate lines depending on what you want to order. I waited in line for close to 20 minutes and I wish that there was a better system in place. I got a half of a chicken salad croissant with a cup of asparagus and leek soup. Heavenly, I tell you. My mouth rejoiced. I also sampled some French Macarons and they were as good as good can be.",

The dessert case is very tempting, yet I avoided it so I can't really review any of the treats, but the macaroons are beautiful and looled fresh. You can see the pastry chefs whipping the work in the back. I ordered a turkey and brie sandwich served on a baguette with raspberry compote, and added bacon. The bread was very crusty, the bacon. I went back for extra compote on the side, which tasted great. The restaurant is in a great corner location, but you have to either park on the street or in the parking garage in the back. We got a perfect spot on the street directly out front, and rode scooters up and down the block after lunch.",

After checking out the 2 large dessert displays I settled on an eclair and a napoleon. Both were good but the cream in the Napoleon appeared to be partially frozen. Not sure if this is from the temperature in the display case or if they freeze their desserts hence the lost star. They also have a full menu if you are looking for something to eat outside of desserts.",

The blackberry tart was outstanding: the dough flaky, the perfect balance of blackberry, meringue,  lemon... really great.

Browny was good but macaroon was so out of world like i will literally make a trip to North Carolina to have it again!

They have literally sold millions of these brownies that's how good they are! I also got a maple bacon macaroon. It wasn't as good as some of their other macaroon flavors I've had, but it was still pretty good.  Despite always being crowded, you can almost always find a spot to sit. The staff is always friendly and is more than happy to talk you through every single menu and baked good option if you asked them. The prices are a little high, but you can taste the quality and care they put into everything on their menu so it's worth it.",

Truthfully it's just because the space is a bit bigger and the ordering process isn't so cluttered and squished, but no matter which location you choose you'll be happy you stopped by!   Amelie's food and drink menu is pretty huge, featuring a large array of sandwiches, salads, soups and an entire MASSIVE cabinet of sweets. While coming in for lunch is the obvious choice to try a bit of everything Amelie's is also perfect for a quaint afternoon tea (which is one of my favorite things to do when I'm in town). For less than $10 you can get a pot of tea for two, all the accompaniments as well as a few small sweets to satisfy your craving. I also really enjoy their coffee drinks and the few specialty lemonades i've had (lavender-honey lemonade is a brilliant combo)!   Service at both locations has always been very good, with the people behind the counters happy to answer any questions we have about the menu. I will say I feel like the Uptown location is a bit quicker, as the process as a whole seems a bit more streamlined and organized to get people who have to get back to work in and out quickly.   If you haven't experienced the magic which is Amelie's there's nothing else to say but GO NOW. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",

I've eaten here several times this week while in town on business and will definitely return. Today's location is across from the convention center and the line has been out the door since 8 am, yet here we are at 1 Pm and the entire team is still smiling and hustling! The line moves fast, the food is served hot and the coffee is great.   The decor is a fresh take on a Parisian coffee house, each location is slightly different but follows the same theme.   Do not miss this place, and be sure to thank your server for caring so much about keeping the food and coffee coming. Great job team! Thank you!!",

When you come in you are greeted by the amazing smell of pastries and soft classic music in the background. This spot is located in the heart of the city making it very convenient. I tried the fresh fruit tart with kiwi and strawberries which honestly wasn't my favorite. I then tried the creeme brulee that was torched to perfection, it's a must have! I ended with a wild berry and chai tea macaroons! Which tasted like heaven. A cozy quiet bakery, that makes you want to do homework or even start reading a book.",

They have wonderful coffee and tea options--the Herbal tea with lavender and chamomile is excellent hot or iced. I also love their mochas when I want caffeine with almond milk.   For this location you have to park uptown, I parked in a parking deck and walked to Amelie's.",

We ordered the breakfast sandwich - sausage with Asiago croissant and bacon, portabella mushroom , manchego cheese , and greens in a baguette ( coz I needed a heavier bread ).  The total was $22.23( with tax), great price for an amazing meal . Was tempted to order macaroons but no sweets this morning . Definitely recommended to have a brunch or quick snack in this place .

The restaurant is quite eclectic with chandeliers, wooden Champagne baskets, pictures of Louis and the Mona Lisa and other French icons all over the place. The line wrapped around the cafe and we had to pick if we were eating or just getting dessert. We opted for lunch and saw the desserts in the case on the right from afar. There is also a bakery with clear glass where you can see all of the action. They make brownies daily and the sign showed how many of the famous brownies were produced to give you an idea of their popularity. We had the coq a van soup and had the chicken salad sandwich on a baguette. This was the BEST chicken salad sandwich I have ever had and wish I knew the secret ingredients to make it at home. Once you order, you find a seat and the food is brought to you. They have real cutlery and it was truly one of the best cafe lunches we have had. When I was in Atlanta recently I also saw an Amelie's there. I will come back to Charlotte or Atlanta just for the chicken sandwich!",

The original location is in NODA, but all are great.   The breakfast sandwich selection is mighty tasty! I personally recommend the croissants, just because they are so tasty and flakey! They are the right size and everything is so fresh on it. You can add cheeses, meats and greens on top.   The coffee and bake goods are so good too! They offer great lunch options as well. Truly a great place for French feels or just a great cup of coffee. This place is amazing!!!",

We went after 2:00 p.m. and had to wait a short while to order at counter (only one cashier); took a bit longer than I anticipated as did the wait for food.  Decor is refreshing and charming.

I was told that they had sold out and that you need to get there early in the morning (was going around 4pm the first three days due to training sessions I was attending) so on the last day I was there, I went during breakfast.  Ended up having the croissant with eggs, sausage and spinach.  Tasty but you can't really do anything different than anyone else making a breakfast sandwich.  I did have their special coffee of the month, which was really good.  I wish I could remember what the cashier called it - something like toasted almond caramel latte.  The first day, I tried their salted caramel layer torte (third from right on the third rack down in the picture).  It was ok, kind of dry but I'm not sure if it was because I ate it there so it came directly from their case.  Maybe it needed to sit a bit so it could reach room temp?",

As a young person I worked every position in a restaurant. There are \"tip\" positions and \"non-tip\" positions. Tips are for providing service at a table.  I suppose it's only a matter of time before Burger King has a tip jar at the drive through window.",

There were so many pastries to choose from and they all looked so delicious.   I got the: - turkey/bacon/cheddar quiche= a bit charred, but very delicious and didn't taste burnt. The crust was crisp and flaky, the egg base fluffy.  - lemon tea cake = chewy and moist with a light lemon flavor, which didn't taste artificial. - pecan pie = wasn't excessively sweet and thick crust.  It was all so good that I returned the following day before my flight.   The decor was so darn cute! Between the chandelier made of pots and pans, mix-matched furniture, striped walls, the large window where you can watch the bakers...it all felt so inviting, fun and like the kind of place I'd want to spend hours in.   This a great place for all ages and for all occasions! Between the tables inside, on the lower level and outside...there's ample seating.",

My most recent three visits were so dismal that I've decided I likely won't continue spending money at this location.   A few things that swayed my opinion: rude staff, multiple incorrect orders, suspiciously long wait times, all out anarchy at the cashier lines and seemingly no interest in helping from the staff, declining quality of food, and, all this considered, overly priced products.   I wish I could pin point the difference here and figure out a way to deal with it. This location is ideal in that it's walking distance from my home and office. I'm willing to admit that I might have a higher # of bad visits simply because I go here a lot (something about percentages, and ratios, and odds, and blah-blah-blah).   In any case, I still support the Amelie's brand. I've visited the other locations and it seems the problems are isolated to this one. The one bright spot to this location, as of late, is the bar staff -- they've been great the few times I've sat at the bar and they have a nice selection of wine and bubbly stuff. The baristas making the coffee bevs are usually great, as well.   According to Yelp, 2 stars is the same as saying \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and that is a perfect way to describe it. Namely, the better experience was at the Uptown location roughly this time last year and/or the NoDa location present day. :\\",

I had asked the cashier and she said it wasn't sweetened, but it definitely was! The croissant was big, but it wasn't flakey enough - definitely not the best croissant. Macaron was good though.

Beautiful atmosphere, great pastries (sweet tooth lovers down fall), open kitchen concept is nice as it's awesome to see the chefs and bakers make magic and the energy is always on point here.   One caveat.....the bar tends to be slow on the trigger pull to take your order, so if your impatient, go to the line, but since I am a \"sit at the bar girl\" I just make sure they see me...couple winks, a little eye contact, a \"friendly\" DC \"yo!\". LOL.  So real talk, I dock a star for the lack of attention the bartenders give as they are more focused on being baristas than anything but still, I observe pretty antsy people. But when you have them, they are personable and friendly.  Turkey Bacon Croissant - get the full sandwich, you'll be pissed if you eat a half because it's sooo dog gone good.   Chai creme latte - awesome, and they serve almond milk for us that can't tolerate a cow.   Explore the menu of wines and beers if you have time.   I always go when I need to read or do homework but want to be in the mix of good energy.   Parking - no recommendations, I live in Uptown so I don't dare jump in my car to come here.",

Plenty of seating and I love that utilized glass walls so you can watch the chefs!  Last night I brought 12 middle school girls here for a bible study. We were able to easily find a table and chairs big enough. Everyone in the group got an assortment of drinks and goodies. I chose the gluten free salted caramel brownie and a hazelnut latte. I convinced a handful of the girls who hadn't had dinner to get the breakfast sandwich. I absolutely love the bacon and egg breakfast sandwich on a croissant. 1. It is the size of your face and 2. The bacon on it is amazing. All the girls agreed that it was spot on delish!  Amelies is a spot we take guests to when they visit and I actually like this location a bit better than Noda due to the size and layout.",

    "text": "Very popular place for baked goods and coffee. I've been coming here for years. This specific location is always busy and service is generally nice service. I came and ordered a Carmel latte as I usually do. I've had over dozens and know how they usually taste. The guy that took my order told me that it would take a minute as I was the only was at the register. My latte was ready after five minutes. The girl that made it called out my name and I went to pick it up. It was luke-warm. When I tried it, it was absolutely undrinkable. It tasted like dirty steamed milk. I took off the lid to look and it barely had any color to it. I'm pretty sure that she ran a used filter basket. I brought it back to the counter and kindly told the guy at the register that it was awful. He called another barista over and Told him \" can you remake her latte apparently it tastes like s****\". At this point I had to leave, I asked for a refund because I didn't want another one. He called the manager over and I explained the situation to him that this was the first latte I've had there that tasted like dirty milk, and not like the usual. Without even an apology, he just told me he would credit my refund this ONE time because I didn't like it due to \"preference of taste\". I would have really loved to see him drink a $6 latte made from a used filter basket. Probably not returning as there are plenty of other coffee options in the area. This place is good for the experience, but lacks customer service, professionalism and customer satisfaction.",

    "text": "Incredible French bakery with a ton of space and a really large menu! I have never seen a cafe like this before. The interior has three different levels of seating, each with an assortment of decorations and bright colors. It was beautiful! I love how everything was mismatched and still worked together perfectly. Also, there was so much space on the different floors to sit! The space was HUGE. Perfect for studying or long conversations, one could spend hours there and feel perfectly at home.  There are so many options on their menu and everything looked absolutely delicious! I ordered a Lemon Raspberry Mini Tart, a Tomato & Pesto Tartine, and a Lavender & Honey Soda. The Lemon Raspberry Mini Tart was so refreshing and light, the perfect way to finish off my meal. The Tomato & Pesto Tartine was so so good! I'm a huge fan of pesto and the open faced sandwich was crispy and warm. I really enjoy it! As for the Lavender & Honey Soda, I was pleasantly surprised. I usually don't go for sodas but the barista recommended this one to me. I'm so glad they did! It wasn't too sweet and was made-to-order. It didn't overpower the rest of my meal and was a refreshing compliment to the Tartine.   Overall, I really loved this beautiful French cafe! It is obvious that they put a lot of attention into the quality and presentation of their food, it does not disappoint! Everything from the friendliness of the staff to the unique interior decorations made this such a great experience. I can't wait to go the next time I'm in the area or in one of their other locations around the country.",

Regardless of the location, they are all consistent and a really fun experience.  Loaded with macaroons and other flavorful pastries Amelie's is a must try with their French inspired decor and tons of wonderful pastries.  Not in the mood for sweets?  Amelie's also has a savory menu full of tartines, salads and sandwiches.  All of which can be complimented with a local draft beer or a glass of vino. I typically go for the wild mushroom tartine and a glass of pino noir however, the salted caramel brownie is a local fav.",

I went by on a Friday morning and it was packed, very long line, except for the line for the sweets.  So I decided to get the macaroons - which I had, had before as someone had brought me some.  When I went to check out, I was in sticker shock.  I guess I had not paid attention to the price, and when you get a couple it adds up quickly.  I suppose they are standard in pricing, maybe slightly higher for macaroons, but still, not worth the price in my opinion when you never know what you will get.  Sure some of them are great, but many lack flavor.  For example, one I got was a cookie dough one, would have never known it was cookie dough, bland and flavorless, as was the strawberry lemonade (lemon was strong, strawberry was where??), but then the chocolate and orange were good.  I would be interested in going back to try other things, but for now, it's just an okay place to me.",

My favorites were lemon, salted caramel, strawberry, and vanilla. Raspberry and coffee were also good, just not as strong as the others (IMO).   Before checking out (the second time I stopped by), the beautiful little salted caramel brownie caught my eye. And I am so glad it did! It's incredible - soft caramel over a beautifully crunchy brownie. So good!   The staff is friendly and wonderful. Both times I stopped in they were friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend!",

Aside from that though, the pastries are so tasty and the tea was delightful as well!  I got the pecan sticky bun and all I can say is wow. It was buttery, flaky, cinnamony, a tad sticky without being overly messy, and the pecans gave it a delicious crunch. The dough tasted like a croissant in a way (except it was sweeter and in the form of a sticky bun). I'll be honest, when I picked it out I expected it to be good, but it ended up really blowing me away. I also got a lemon tea and it looked to me like they filled the teabags themselves with the loose tea leaves. It was really smooth and comforting and did wonders for my sore throat.  Unfortunately I don't live in Charlotte so I can't visit as much as I'd like, but the next time I'm in town visiting family I'll definitely be back!",

Their macaroons are also always delicious and fresh daily.   This location is always busy, but worth the wait in line. The line goes faster then you think and you will not be disappointed when you get your food or drinks. It is a very large space so you will never have a hard time finding a spot to sit. Whenever I am in the area, I make it a point to stop here!",

I was looking for a spot that offered all of the below and Amelie's delivered on all fronts:  -Strong wifi -Cute and cozy ambiance -Coffee -Wine -A delicious snack  There is a huge food menu with a ton of sweet and savory options. The bakery counter has macarons in every color and flavor plus lots of other tasty looking sweets. But it was really hard to turn down savory. In addition to sandwiches and salads they also have a large selection of tartines in full and half size. The half size tartine was the perfect snack. I went with the fig and brie which was smothered with delicious creamy cheese. The sweet fig spread complimented it perfectly.  There is a drink menu for whatever you are craving. Lots of coffee drinks and espressos plus a drink menu with wines, beers and mimosas. I had a glass of pinot noir and an espresso.   This is a great setting to get some work done solo or meet friends. There is plenty of seating and the decor and music is on point. Love me some acoustic Talking Heads + Macy Grey covers. The decor made me feel like I was at a cafe in France.  5 stars and more for a wonderful experience at Amelie's. And bonus points for it being next door to my hotel.",

I came in one night to try just a macaroon (~$2). It was okay. The next night I had a late 11pm snack of a chicken salad croissant half + tomato soup ~$8. The croissant was sort of stale (this is probably my fault as it was at 11pm). The tomato soup was nice and warm. Overall, I would say its a nice place for a quick snack as it is very reasonable, open late, and spacious. Definitely able to accommodate large groups.",

    "text": "What a cool French (and delicious) bakery! I give Amelie's a full five stars without hesitation. This is the first Charlotte restaurant (as a new resident!) I can say has lived up to its hype. The salted caramel brownie was phenomenal (a nice rich brownie base with a yummy caramel-like icing with a slight crunch which I'm assuming was the hint of salt); the salted caramel brownie was not overly salted, which can sometimes happen with salted desserts. The napoleon is another good choice and featured a rich vanilla frosting and creamy layering with puffed pasty... yummy! The two best sandwiches, in my opinion, were the chicken salad sandwich and ham/cheese/manchego croissant sandwich. The salted brownie caramel brownie latte was to die for (cannot imagine the calories count). One thing to note if you're a latte/cappuccino person is that there are only full fat and almond milk options available (ie no skim, 2%, etc.). Also, the macarons are offered in a multiple of flavors but are a little price and $2 and some change.",

The province BLT was soo yummy especially with the fruit salad side. When the sign says they've sold over 110,000 salted caramel brownies- how can you not try one?? I wasn't disappointed! It was awesome. The pastry selection was vast and left me struggling on what to get because everything looks so good!! A friend had a few mini tarts that were really good and my daughter enjoyed her orange macaron. The lemonade classique depends on who makes it- yesterday's was better than today's but I would still get it again. For breakfast, I had egg, cheddar, tomato & spinach on a baguette! Wow! Basically, my favorite breakfast. I wish they would open one in Raleigh so I could enjoy it more often!! If you are at a convention- go here for sure since I know convention center food usually sucks. But if you work in the area- beware you could find yourself here multiple times a week!!! The ample outdoor seating is perfectly shaded to keep you cool on a hot Charlotte day. I can't wait to get back here!!",

Their cafe au lait is definitely one of the best I have tried. I wish we could have spent some more time to hangout there.",

Came here with the plan to eat lunch (turkey brie sandwich was delicious!), drink some French press (yum!) and do some work on my laptop.   Unfortunately, wifi was AWFUL (I came at 1:30 p.m., so maybe the lunch rush was to blame?), and when I did connect, everything moved at a snail's pace. Had to leave because I couldn't get anything done. Be warned if you plan on working from here. (I realize this is not a review of the food/drinks, but part of the appeal of this huge space, I thought, was the ability to camp out for several hours working.)",

I recently moved to the area and have heard nothing but good things about Amelie's French Bakery and Cafe. I knew I had to try it! I went to a Yelp event here, hosted by Amelie's and Pure Intentions Coffee, the coffee that they serve. I learned so much about how Pure Intentions roasts their coffee and how it gets from the harvest to your cup at Amelie's. Matt Yarmey, the company's owner and founder, shared with us his story and all about the fair trade coffee that he is so passionate about. We also got to hear from Mora, a manager at Amelie's, who shared with us a little bit about the company and led us in a delicious coffee tasting. Definitely one of the coolest events I have gone to! A huge thank you to Nikki, who organized the event and has put in so much work to all of the Charlotte Made events! This one was definitely one of my faves!",

On the plus side the cafe is very inviting with French decor and plenty of seating.

Love their chocolate eclairs but I'm not spending my hard earned cash here.  First time: never been to any Amelie's but had tried an eclair someone gave me. I was looking for a menu for the pastries and asked the cashier and in a unfriendly tone she said: \"we don't have menus here!\" So I say: \"how do I know what pastries you have?\" She says: \"look at the case\". Fair enough though she could have withheld the tude. I go to the case and the lady is exasperated due to lunch rush and does not hold back when serving me. I extend some grace due to the lunch rush situation and how that can get on someone's nerves. I go back to the cashier (same lady with the attitude), and I pay. Interestingly enough, she's scoping my receipt to see if I'm going to tip her. Geez... I wonder if I did. Would you? Exactly. Second Visit: staff is different and nice. Pay attention to what I'm about to say because this is what caused issues during my third and final visit ever.  I walk in, go to the cashier to order pastries and the cashier tells me that I don't need to go to him, just to simply WALK STRAIGHT TO THE PASTRY COUNTER IF I'M THERE TO BUY PASTRIES.  I follow instructions so what do you think I do in my third visit? You got it! Third Visit: I walk straight to the pastry counter and ask for an eclair. The lady behind the counter makes some weird face and then proceeds to tell me in a condescending as in \"you're so stupid\" tone: \"You just cut in front of all these people, like...\" I looked at the line and then looked at her and told her I simply did what I'd been instructed to do in my previous visit and that I never meant to cut in line (20 people! -- who does that on purpose?). I was so embarrassed. So I turned around and walked out. Honestly, I think their pastries are good but not great. Being that Charlotte does not have many options at this point, I would have been a customer but I think that Amelie's has gotten too big for her bitches, I mean, her britches and their service is subpar. I won't be a patron to a rude business. It's a matter of principle. Will never return.",

The BLT had one small slice of tomato, one strip of bacon cut in half and lettuce. I do have to say that the croissant was nice and flakey.  The tomato fennel soup was inedible. I LOVE tomato soup (not canned) and was more excited to dig into it than the sandwich but a giant spoonful left me reliving my last, unfortunate childhood experience with Chef Boyardee. It tasted just like canned spaghetti Os. I left the entire cup.   Lavendar lemonade? Pass. I didn't really taste the lavendar.   The 2 stars are for ambiance and the phenomenal pumpkin cream puff I took back to the hotel. I am more than likely to go back for the pastries only before flying out. Good stuff.",

While the ambience is not exactly the same as there is not the cozy living room/den furniture (or, at least, not as much) as the original location on North Davidson, there is a lot to like here besides the delicious food. There are still plenty of nooks and crannies to sit and eat/study or have a meeting with a friend or business associate as the layout is much larger than the original. While parking is not always easily obtained without paying, if you work uptown and are in a rush or live uptown - you now have a great version of Amelie's to call your own. As the business evolves it will find it's own ambience, right now it's a little too clean and neat compared to the original, but the food is still great and although it does not stay open as late as the North Davidson location, it is still a fun place to hang out.",

    "text": "This is simply the best french bakery I've ever had. I am convinced it may be the absolute best in America.  I went to Charlotte for work about two years ago, and someone recommended it to me as a great place for a sweet tooth.  Added bonus: it's also 24 hours!  When I got there at 2:45 am, there was a line going from the counter, around the corner, into another room, along another hall and almost to the restroom in the very back of the building.  20 minutes later, I understood why.  It was magnificent!  The pastries were so light and fluffy, just sweet enough to satisfy, but not so sweet that it unpleasant.  Last year, my fiancee and I were driving back to Pittsburgh from the Florida Keys and a bad accident took us off track, so I convinced my fiancee to take a 20 minute detour to Amelies for pastries for our friends who were dog sitting for us while we were out of town.  We were the heros when we got home to our friends.  Now Amelies is an all time favorite of ours.  It's just...well, it's worth the detour.",

We loved them so much that we bought a half dozen to take back home!  The decor is a bit strange but it definitely made it interesting.  The people were very friendly and very helpful!  Will definitely go back anytime we are in Charlotte again!",

Located in the middle of downtown Charlotte, my friends and I visited this place prior to a Hornets game in order to kill some time and satisfy our sweet tooth. Amelie's did its best job to make the venue a modern, upbeat, French cafe. The walls are littered with surrealistic paintings, fancy clocks, and bookshelves. The store itself is three stories high, so you won't have a hard time finding a place to sit. I got the macarons and these were either a hit or miss. A couple of my macarons were very hard to chew, while others were fine. The macarons were also a little too sweet to my liking, but may attract those who enjoy sweeter taste. I also was able to try to creme brulee there, which came out a little too burnt on the top (the burnt taste was overwhelming). Also, the strawberry pie/tart that one of my friends got wasn't all too great so I don't recommend that. The only reason why I didn't give Amelie's a five star is because the food and pastries that I tried were somewhat subpar to my expectations. However, I will most definitely visit again and give their other stuff a try!",

I ordered the Jambon et Fromage (Thinly sliced ham on buttered baguette, your choice of cheddar, mozzarella or asiago cheese) but I chose to replace the baguette with croissant. To be quite honest, the croissant was the only good thing about that sandwich. The ham and cheese were edible but I've tasted better at a pop up sandwich shop at the corner of an airport. Ambience however? Great! As a french bakery, obviously I had to try their macarons and other pastries. I ended up getting 2 macarons (egg nog & sugar cookie; which are their seasonal flavors), a fruit tart and a few palmier cookies. No, I wasn't expecting Laduree standard macarons but they were way too chewy, too sweet, and was lacking in flavor. The fruit tart and palmier cookies however were fresh, crumbly and absolutely pleasant. I would recommend this cafe to everyone but you might want to do a little bit of research on what to get and what not to get here as it could be a real hit or miss.",

The signature vertical striped walls are still here, but in a much larger space.  There's also the \"aquarium\" view of the bakers/chefs hard at work to bring you all the treats that Amelie's has to offer.  Kind of pulls back the \"curtain\" on where the all the goodness comes from.... right from the kitchen!  Depending on the time you decide to hit the uptown location, it usually tends to be pretty busy.  The lines move fairly quickly.  THERE ARE 3 LINES!   One for the goods in the case (per usual) and then two other lines to order hot food and coffee.  I've recently gotten a breakfast sandwich here and it was awesome.  You pick your bread vessel, eggs are included, choice of meat, and cheese = the best way to start your morning.    The location is so big, there are pagers and locators for the table... after you place your order, you get a pager and you place it on the carrier on the table of your choice.  The nice servers will bring you your stuff when it's ready.  Apparently you can do to-go orders and they will shout your number when your order is ready...  No shortage of quirky-decor here... a great place to relax with a coffee, or just hang out and converse with friends.  There's even an outdoor patio with tables - I have yet to enjoy due to the weather - but I'm sure it will be a must during the nice summer evenings in Charlotte.",

I love that they added computer tables and lots of plug-ins.  I also love the large bar.  You can sit their and order food and drink as well.  They have a great electronic tracking system for them to find you and deliver your food, but you have to hang around and listen for them to yell your name for drinks.  They should get a pa system or electronic board for that.  Parking is horrible and expensive, so unless you have other reasons to be uptown, it's a toss up whether an extra $10-20 to park for a couple of hours is worth it.  Of course, it's a great option and spot for our Queen City employees and visitors so I'm very happy Amelies is there. Bon Appetit!",

    "text": "Ahh, Amelie's.  I haven't been back to an Amelie's in six years, but it never disappoints.  The space is huge at this location and has plenty of space.  This space would be great for work or studying.  Amelie's has a massive, massive case of French macarons, tarts, brownies, creme brulees, cream puffs... the list goes on and on.  The prices are fairly reasonable, too.  They have a tea and coffee bar as well.  I'd recommend this place as a nice breakfast spot, afternoon snack, or after dinner dessert.  It might even be a good place to take a date :)  After a long and hard decision, I decided to get the salted caramel brownie.  It was delicious!  It's much less brownie than it is a salted caramel... bar.  I didn't really taste all that much chocolate, or at least it wasn't overpowering.  I actually prefer this.  The whole thing was probably a billion calories as it was really rich and buttery (but not too much!) - so worth it.  Have these on your cheat day.  I also had a blue and yellow (lavender and chamomile) tea with my little dessert.  Perfect for a relaxing evening dessert.  I will definitely be back to try the other desserts.  Maybe even for breakfast if I want to indulge.",

Everything was on point from the macaroons to the salt caramel brownies to the iced lattes I am sorry I mean \"grand creme.\" Now the decor here is like something out of Alice in Wonderland-seriously stairs here and there. Chandeliers made of French horns and trumps and mirrors embedded in live bushes. It's fun and playful. So enjoy your sweets and don't be startled if the mad hatter joins you for some tea and macaroons :)",

Please stop finishing your tarts with glaze...fresh fruit is fine. Others love it, so try it if u want.   Today, my broccoli and cheddar quiche was \"overheated\"...and burnt. Not sure why they didn't chop the broccoli into smaller pieces. My asparagus, leek soup was fine and its usual watery. I did enjoy my Elderflower Lemonade. Sorry Amelie's Uptown...my meals in Noda and Rock Hill were always fresh. Step it up.",

But they only half solved the problem. I appreciate the tremendous improvement in signage. But it's still far too slow.   Today... I wanted a sandwich and a twice baked croissant. Got in the 'everything' line. Waited about 15 minutes, ordered the twice baked croissant from the pastry desk. Couldn't order my sandwich then. Was told to wait to order the sandwich at the register. 5 minutes later, ordered the sandwich. Was surprised they put together my sandwich as quickly as they did! Then was terribly disappointed when I opened my bag to find a cold, prepared-earlier-in-the-day croissant with chicken salad.   Ugh. If I wanted a cold prepared sandwich from the case, I'd save half my money and get it from the Teeter or get one as good for a few dollars less at Something Classic. And save at least 20 minutes! Instead I waited about 30 minutes for a very mediocre sandwich.   I hate getting fooled over and over. There's way too little consistency for me to 1) recommend or 2) go back.",

It is always busy and I am not surprised by that. The location is large and has ample seating spaces, including outside. It has a comfortable fireplace area downstairs.  Parking is an issue as it is only on-street parking, but totally worth it. The bathrooms are clean, the staff is friendly (despite being super busy) and the decor mind-blowing.   I love how the cooks are working behind the large glass walls, in their chef gear. It gives it a very professional feel. The reason I am not giving it five stars is the overpriced coffee and the lack of parking. But truly both things are not something that should discourage one to go. I just do not like cruising too long to get a spot if I want to get coffee nor do I want to spend more than three dollars on a simple drink. But if you do not mind, the regular coffee is well priced, so this is a good way to avoid paying the \"hipster\" price.",

By this time, late to a morning meeting - I notify one of the managers that I must leave as I am now late for work, he assured me he would refund me. Days go by without my refund.. I've called multiple times and talked to multiple \"managers\" who promise my refund and that the primary manager would contact me. Haven't heard anything. I've been to the Noda location an I can attest that this experience is not exemplary of the original location. Don't visit this location - you'll end up -$10 and no breakfast sandwich.",

And so far, for both locations and I've gone 3 times, still lacks ganache!  This place is simply a WANNABE FRENCH CAFE, NOR IS IT ATLANTA'S CAFE INTERMEZZO.   I swear I've tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, but again to my chagrin it continues to disappoint. 1.  It has too many damn rules to take an oder with white tablecloth prices. 2.  There is nothing exceptional about the pastries.  A matter of fact they're average at best. And lastly, I suggest try to be original. Your decor lacks intimacy, let alone the cheap bar stools from that appear to be from Marshals. I would suggest that you spend the money and put some carpet down to dampen the constant echoing, instead of insulting your customers with some cheap landlord allocated CAM buildout deal. Just saying.....  Handsome (Everyone knows my name) Asheville,  NC",

As a suggestion to management: Put the names of the macaroons on the end of the tray holding each flavor. The amount of time wasted by each customer asking for a recitation (sometimes more than once) slows the line unnecessarily. If you're going to stock a dozen flavors, then make the effort to explain what you're selling.",

We met at 11:45, and the place was already hopping, so we quickly got into one of the two lines for food (there's a separate one for pastries). Unfortunately, although one cashier was working our line, two cashiers were working the other line. It was really inefficient, and we had to wait forever to order.  I got the turkey and brie on a croissant instead of a baguette, and my friend got the turkey and bacon on a croissant. Both were tasty, but both of our croissants were cooked just a little too much and crumbled into a million pieces every time we bit into them. By the end, we were brushing crumbs out of each other's hair.   However, we were able to grab a seat in front of the huge window where you can watch the chefs make all their pastries, so we got lunch and a show. We also saw a ton of movers and shakers, so this isn't the place to go for a quiet meal. As someone else mentioned, the wi fi was non-existent while we were there; I couldn't even execute a simple Google search on my phone. I love Amelie's, so hopefully this was a rare iffy experience... looking forward to giving it another go soon!",

    "text": "I went here for Brinner (breakfast for dinner). I was in Charlotte traveling for work and needed to get some work done so this place provided the perfect spot for me to do that. I got the following:   -Bacon, egg and cheese croissant  -fruit tart  -salted caramel brownie   All were really great. The croissant was a little overdone, but it was still that flaky croissant that you dream about if you are a pastry lover. The salted caramel brownie lived up to the hype--it was great, if you go here you have to get one. Some reviews claim it is overrated, I on the other hand really enjoyed it.   The atmosphere here is great, there are a TON of places to sit down and work. I was here for about 3 hours and enjoyed it. The people watching was great and it wasn't too noisy. The only reason this place gets a 4 instead of 5 stars is the parking situation. I had to pay to park, $6 I believe. Then, where I parked was a garage that was connected to the building--easy to access during business hours, however, when I went to leave the establishment all the doors for easy access were locked. This forced me to walk outside and then have to climb up the ramps to the floor I parked on--this wasn't likely the safest option. Perhaps they should have special access to the garage during off hours...or some sort of a solution here. I would go back and would definitely recommend this place.",

Today, I dined in and ordered the mango, crispy prosciutto and mango salad with chicken and candied orange + lavender cafe soda.   In regard to my beverage, the woman behind the counter had little knowledge about the drink besides that it was strong (had a shot of espresso in it, in addition to lavender simple syrup, orange juice, sparkling water and candied orange peel). As you can tell by the ingredients, I was perplexed as to how this would taste. Surprisingly, it was not too sweet and had a strong coffee taste with a hint of orange. I did not taste lavender, but maybe my taste sense was off today?! Anyway- I do recommend trying this at least once...not sure how long it will be around as it's on the summer drink menu.  The salad did not have the best visual appearance but was quite delicious. I loved the passion fruit vinaigrette and how the different ingredients melded together. Thin strips of mango and jicama, pineapple and crispy prosciutto...made for a delicious salad.   You can never go wrong though with a croissant sandwich or their soups. And as others have noted, the salted caramel brownie is the absolute best dessert here. Do not leave without one in your hand!",

I'm sorry, this is a bakery???? what is wrong with this picture.  My husband ordered apple crisp.  it was HARD ROCK.  couldn't even eat it.  He took it back and they said. 'oh, you should have asked to be warmed up'.  so, we said, ok, warm it up.  sat there with our lattes waiting.  10 min. later, they apologized and said it will be ready in 5 minutes.  they forgot to warm it up??  even after warming up, it still wasn't good.    I hope they improve soon.  we love the lattes there, but being a bakery they need to have better quality pastries too!",

The chai I had was so delicious and the cinnamon around the edge was a nice touch. However, I am docking a star because the strawberry cake I selected could have been better. This is probably due to improper storing and maybe multiple chill and defrosting situations.  The frosting flaked and crumbled, like blue cheese. It tasted like pure sugar with a touch of strawberry. The cake base was too wet, mushy almost. The saving grace would have been the strawberry filling had it not been so cold. Overall, the presentation of the cake was alluring, but the taste was disappointing. I also felt like it was maybe stale/a few days shy of fresh. I didn't get the chance to try any other desserts so, I wouldn't say don't go there. I would just steer clear of any cakes.",

I went three times during one visit in Charlotte. Sometimes people working there were nice; other times, they were not so friendly.   Ambiance: The cutest!  Lots of decorations line the walls; there are chandeliers and fun decor.   The tables have interesting paint jobs.   Food:  Pastries: Most were tasty, some were ok. The apple pie had the most delicious cobbler-kind of crusty that was moist and crumbly. The tarts had a very hard almost - cookie crust, not as good. The brownies were just ok.   The breakfast sandwiches!!! The egg sandwiches on baguettes were delicious. The eggs themselves had great flavor. One can choose meat, vegs and/or cheese for these. Also, a croissant can be the bread option instead of the white baguette. These are so filling and good.   Salads: Are huge. The radish cucumber salad is paired with a tasty peanut type dressing.   Drinks: I had some sort of fancy mimosa that tasted tart and fizzy with a buzz.  I did not order other drinks, but noted that they had numerous options.",

I ask for my bacon extra crispy because i do not like bacon barely cooked and prefer it closet to burnt. Past 2 times either the cashier doesn't ring it in correctly or the line cook ignores directions. I had to,throw the bacon out it was so under cooked. Awful. Cheese was off the sandwich and on the container...the quality had deteriorated from over a year ago when I really enjoyed it. Their desserts are good, pricey but good.",

While this downtown location doesn't have the charming hominess of the NODA location, that's ok with me. It more than makes up for it in the fact that the line moves quicker, there's was more seating, and just tons of space in general! Plus, the location is right downtown, mere steps from the hotel I always stay in while I'm in Charlotte.  We went one evening (great, long hours, by the way!) and got macarons, a salted caramel bar, and an amazing thing called a creme brulee soda. We went back the next morning for yogurt and granola, swoon-worthy breakfast sandwich on a croissant, and an espresso soda drink.   The variety is astounding, the staff is always perky and helpful. I just wish the labeled their macaron flavors so I didn't have to constantly ask their staff to tell me which is which.",

    "text": "Went here while I was visiting Charlotte because it had good reviews and was close by to the church that I went to for Sunday Mass. After the Mass ended, it was around 12:30 and Amelie's seemed like the perfect place to grab lunch.   I walked in and have to say it was somewhat confusing. There's a really big open area when you walk in and my eyes instantly went to a sign that says \"LINE STARTS HERE\" indicating a hard right upon entering the door. Well I took a hard right and the only thing there was seating and eventually the restrooms followed by an exit. Oooookay. So I walked back up to the front and saw other people ordering by the counters straight ahead from the entrance. So I went there to put my order in and it worked out. But seriously why in the world is that arrow telling you to take an immediate right to get in line when the line starts literally right ahead of you?!   Anyways I got in line which was also weird because some people were ordering from the pastry case and others were in line to order actual food (but it was all one line going to two separate things. Just weird.) I knew I wanted a pastry but since I also wanted food I just figured I'd get to the main register and order it all at once. When I got to the register to put my order in, the woman told me that pastries had to be ordered \"over there\" (same line I just waited in to get to her....). I asked if I could just pay for the pastry and show my receipt to the other associate and she said it was fine. She was definitely unapologetic. So I put my order in and she handed me a buzzer, which I figured would go off in 5-10 mins. But as I'm standing there waiting to get my pastry, it starts going off! What do I do?! Get out of the pastry line to grab my food? Wait for my pastry and then find an associate to tell them I missed catching my food when it came out?! Ugh WHAT A MESS! Anyways I got the damn pastry and then heard someone yelling my name and sure enough it was a woman with my sandwich.   So about the actual food. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich on a croissant, a hot chocolate and a salted caramel brownie. I took a seat at the bar once I had all my items. That's a good place to sit if you're solo obviously.   The chicken salad sandwich was good. The best part was the croissant. Very light and flaky. I normally eat chicken salad on regular bread but I really enjoyed having it on a pastry type bread like that. Might have to make that my new thing. The chicken salad had good flavor but was too chunky in my opinion. I would have liked to see the chicken cut up a bit more.   As for the hot chocolate, I should mention that I was standing right there as she made it and I watched her take a ceramic mug and fill it up HALFWAY with hot chocolate and then put whipped cream to fill up the rest of the cup. So you are definitely not getting your money's worth. I'd say I probably got about ten gulps total out if it. Which was kind of okay since it was way too chocolatey (and I LOVE sweet stuff). What I didn't like was that I could tell they used dark chocolate and not milk chocolate which I prefer. It did taste like expensive dark chocolate though, so at least I felt fancy I guess.   As for the salted caramel brownie, that was the star of the show! Not your typical brownie. Much more thin, but great flavor and perfect amount of sweetness. The caramel blanketing the top had the perfect amount of coverage, great caramel consistency with just a hint of salt. It was delicious! I wish I would have gotten a few more to go!   All in all, it's a place to try at least once. But the confusing setup and ordering process with an average sandwich and \"meeeh\" hot chocolate gives it a 3 from me.",

It notably boasts an apparently high-budget attempt at a campy France-themed kitsch that comes off as a bit inauthentic and yet for that same reason authentic to its neighborhood.  A deceptively extensive menu makes this a desirable spot for a late lunch (don't bother during the midday rush). Really all the options I've tried recommend themselves - the soups may be a bit too savory if that is possible.  An array of delicious and well-made coffee, tea, and milk-based beverages are also on offer. Try the marcotter! (It's better iced). These are prepared at an unhurried pace by a staff that seems to enjoy their work. Wine is available as well and a few local beers on draft.  The pastries, on the other hand, which are a sort of focal point, calling out to the helpless sweet-toothed from large display cases, are a consistent disappointment (and overpriced): Icings, fondants, ganaches, and mousses are oddly firm and chalky, tea cakes too yolk-y, crusts too greasy. The salted-caramel brownies, a best-seller, are incredibly, almost unbelievably sweet globs and little more than that. A glass-walled on-site bakery allows us to peer in on their preparation and, ultimately, they are best taken in with the eyes. They too are of the kitschy French-inspired decor that defines Amelie's, for better and worse.",

They are not \"just another brick in the wall\". Breakfast is usually not as crowded as lunch time (a plus) and I love their quiche-of-the day (haven't eaten one that I didn't love) with a cup of coffee. If you want a change from the mundane, give them a go.",

    "text": "After visiting the Bechtler Museum, my family and I decided we wanted a sweet treat and luckily Amelie's is within walking distance. Although we've visited the Noda and Atlanta location several times, we were still impressed with the esthetics of their uptown location. It's spacious with lots of seating and possesses the typical Amelie's signature decor. At almost 4 pm on a Saturday, I was surprised by the line forming at the pastry case. When we reached the front we ogled in amazement at the vast variety, ultimately settling on mini tarts, macarons, and a chocolate croissant. We also ordered the blackberry limonade, key lime French soda, & a vanilla cafe creme. We settled into a cozy couch across from a faux fireplace and savored our treats. Everything was excellent!",

The space downtown is huge and the French theme is eye catching.   I always find something new to look at when I go there. The best desserts to me is everything of course! But if I had to choose three I would go with the Salted Carmel Brownie, The Napoleon, and Small Pecan Pie.   My next favorites are the macaroons !  You really can't go wrong at this place  and that is why the line is usually long but worth the wait. The downtown location is busier during working hours vs late night like the NODA location.",

Not only do I have a huge sweet tooth, but I'm also a fan of eclectic decorations. The shop was everything I thought it would be. The shop was nice and spacious with a decent amount of seating. I liked how when I approached the glass counter, I didn't feel pressure to buy anything right away. There was just too many desserts to look at (and I am usually a very indecisive person). The workers at the shop were very friendly",

Especially when they're offering different free samples every day, you KNOW how good everything tastes and it gets harder and harder to choose.   Everything from the macarons to the eclairs, petit fours to mousse was top notch. It was a definite repeat visit for us on our short three day trip! It was even BF-approved, and he's not a big dessert guy. Mouthwateringly great.  Pro-Tip: DON'T MISS THE SALTED CARAMEL BROWNIE (which also comes in macaron form, too!)",

    "text": "As a lifelong member of the NoDa crowd, I get a big sense of pride watching a local small business grow into a stately community centerpiece. A FANTASTIC option for impressing visitors to Charlotte. Amelie's is great for a quick or small dessert after dinner and within walking distance from some of the best restaurants in Uptown.  The Amelie's brand has had a ton of success in the most recent decade, opening locations in the Caramel Commons and Park Rd neighborhoods. The key is the consistency in their premium treats. You can go to any Amelie's in the area and ask for the Salted Caramel Brownie and know you're about to have one of the best little morsels in the city no matter which location you're at. This location in particular has a LOT of spacious seating, especially for an uptown location. On the right side of the restaurant you can sit and watch pastries being made behind the huge glass window revealing the entire kitchen, and at the same time people-watch the hustle and bustle of College Street.  The decor is as unique as it gets. They got a thing for unusual chandeliers (ex. they made one out of stainless steel kitchen utensils). The interior design really is a must-see. Facilities are always clean from the tables to the floors, and the staff is friendly and very patient (which is a godsend, even as a seasoned Amelie's patron, I'll sometimes zone out just looking at all the delicious options in the display case).  My recommendation? Give the Dark Chocolate Raspberry Tart a try. You get a nice sized pastry with a rich chocolate ganache piping outlining the sweet fruit filling, on a firm yet flaky pastry pie tart. Also ask the counter staff what their seasonal treats are at the time. They typically have 1 or 2 seasonal Macarons in the case, all which have a perfect crispy wafer texture and incredible fillings.  Found this page and they're closed? No worries, their NoDa location (the original) is open 24/7 and just 10 min outside Uptown; just go 3 blocks to S Davidson, and 2.5mi north, you'll see the store right after Free Range Brewing.  Whatever your sweet tooth craves, you'll surely find something here! I really tried to think of something to critique, but couldn't think of anything valid enough to note... maybe offer free all-day parking? Yeah, get on that, then it'll be perfect!",

This location was previously on South Tryon. I never had the opportunity to visit there.   Of course, this new location is fabulous! The people are friendly, and everything is clean. Parking can be a little tricky (pay attention to the street signs). There are parking decks nearby, I would recommend carpooling with friends.  The Food is always hot and fresh. Personally, I love the spinach and leek quiche, lavender lemonade, and French macarons. Be sure to try the wine selection, you won't regret it!   FYI: You can host events here in the upstairs area. I still haven't it. But I know it's available to reserve!",

There's a main level and then splits so you can explore all around. I love the pastries and tarts, but there's also more substantial items like sandwiches and such.

It's a giant space and I don't know how they get by because I could only imagine the rent. However, this helps in making the place never seem crowded even when it is. In addition, the great customer service helps things move along when there are long lines.  I believe most people come for the pastries, which are delicious. I almost always grab at least one, even if I'm only here for lunch or dinner. I especially liked the double baked chocolate almond croissant. The only other place I've found it was at Jean Paul's in Laguna Beach or while traveling in France. They're also know for their sea salt brownies and the even have a sea salt mocha.   To eat I almost always get the roast beef with manchego cheese on a croissant. Manchego is one of my favorite cheeses and you don't see if paired with a sandwich that often. The daily soups are also great and definitely taste homemade and not out of a can or frozen bag.  It's 5 stars for what it is. It's a great French bistro/cafe. It's not a high-end restaurant with snooty folks. It's a great neighborhood like spot that accommodates both locals and visitors alike and that's why I enjoy dropping in once a week.",

The inside was very big (much bigger than expected) with very cute decor. Includes a bakery, wine/beer bar, cappuccino/coffee bar, as well as plenty of tables for sitting. Loved it and would definitely return to any of the 6 locations!!",

This was my second or third time visiting the Uptown location. It is a large space and keeps the same look and feel as the NoDa location. With eclectic art pieces like chandeliers, Mona Lisa and the iconic blue and white striped walls, it feels like you're getting a glimpse of France.    On this trip, we were eating lunch. I got a blueberry and peach salad with a raspberry balsamic vinegrette, a cup of spinach, asparagus and leek soup and a chocolate coconut pecan bread pudding for dessert. The salad was one of the best salads I've had in a long time. The salad was harmoniously balanced with the sweetness of the fruit, the sour of the vinegrette and the saltiness of the blue cheese crumbles. To top it off, the croissant croutons were a special treat. The soup I've had before and it never disappoints. Each of their soups seem like they take the time to build a robust flavor. And the bread pudding was delicious. The bread used were their delicious buttery croissants. And they take about ten minutes to heat up, but when it comes out the chocolate is melted and it really is a special treat.",

A whole 5 people were behind us and after we ordered and payed she apologized and said sorry they took so long under her breath. Terrible customer service.",

I happened to stumble across this place and was glad I did. When you walk in the decor is very creative and inviting. There is an area for coffee, beer and wine, pastries and other baked goods and a place where you can see them baking. I got in line and the first thing that caught my eye was the Chocolate Twice-Baked Croissant. Since I had never had that before I got it. The inside was more cakey than a traditional croissant but the outside was the traditional buttery flakey goodness. To drink I got my usual vanilla late. The size of the drinks here are a little different than a usual place so don't be surprised when you get your coffee from the bar and it's about the size of a little water cooler cup.  I went back the second day and got another croissant and on my last day I came back with my boyfriend and got a cheese Danish with fresh strawberries and blackberries on it. Definitely, a great find!",

Part of the Amelie's appeal is the unique ambiance, but at this location it feels as though they've tried making an exact replica; right down to the stainless steel kitchen utensil chandelier and striped walls.  Resting in the heart of Uptown, the vibe isn't as chill.  Parking, as you can imagine, is a challenge, and the line situation is out of control.  I'm sure this location is more alluring to those that work Uptown, but for a relaxing coffee and pastry pitstop, it just doesn't work.  Serving as the master pastry kitchen for all of their locations, this one is much larger.  At certain times you can see the chefs working their magic behind the glass.  There is an area upstairs that is closed off for private events only.  Seating is still limited, simply due to the undying popularity.  Be careful if you sit at the back bar by the window facing MLK.  You have a view of legs shuffling by and you are positioned right beneath the main blower vents for the HVAC system.    Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the quality of the pastries, sandwiches, and service are less than those in the NoDa location.  Will I continue to visit the Uptown location from time to time?  Sure, but only based on the convenience factor.  If I had my choice I'd always opt for the original.  If it ain't broke...",

Loved the open concept of the bakery kitchen where you can watch all of the delicious baked goods being freshly made from scratch. Excellent service every time- I came here everyday of my convention and was able to try both breakfast & lunch. I love that you can get breakfast all day with the exception of their oatmeal which is only offered until 10:30am. I LOVED the raspberry compote that came with the oatmeal- DELICIOUS! Their soups, salads and sandwiches were also heavenly! Perhaps the most light and flakey croissant I've ever eaten! While I didn't personally eat any of their pastries, I did buy a dozen to take back to the convention center for the Team. I got a variety of honey buns, eclairs, turnovers and cinnamon twists. They were a HIT and everything was eaten in a matter of minutes! Would definitely come back the next time I'm in town. Was a great place to quietly work, have a business luncheon or meet with friends. Was a large space so great for groups especially Team meetings away from the convention hall.",

I asked if they sold chocolate and they said no. Just chocolate croissants which they are out of.   Being open 24/7 and as expensive as they are I would hope for more variety, I'd recommend calling ahead to see what they have left before coming.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Amelie's for a while. I've seen them on Yelp 4 years ago when I first came to Charlotte but I've never been able to make it to one of their locations. It was just my luck that I saw this location open on my way to the convention center and they were open late so I was able to go after my meeting. First impressions, this place is huge. It's the largest french cafe I've seen. The atmosphere is great. The quirky french decor gives it a very charming feel. Everywhere you look, there is something that catches your eye. You can even see the workers preparing the baked goods through the large glass window into their kitchen.   We tried a few small desserts and coffee drinks. First was the salted caramel brownie. It tasted good but was very sweet. Honestly it felt more like southern comfort food than french cafe. Next was the cream puff. It was filled a custard type cream and covered with chocolate. It was a little heavier than I expected but I still enjoyed it. We tried the bite size key lime meringue pie. That was actually my favorite bite. It was perfectly tart and the meringue was wonderfully light. And lastly was a passion fruit jelly topped with dark chocolate. The citrusy taste of the passion fruit went very well with the dark chocolate.   I ordered a the 17 oz. French press dark roast coffee which was $4. It was good for 2 decent sized cups of coffee. They serve it with sugar and milk on the side. It had a perfect rich coffee taste. Made me want to get my own french press.  Overall this is a great place to hang out. Come with a group and share some desserts and drinks. They even have wine and beer.",

Delicious breakfast sandwiches (the croissant is buttery) Very buttery but good.  Time of Visit: Late breakfast Wait: No line, short wait for food. Price: $22 [ 2 breakfast sandwiches + 1 latte + 1 iced coffee] Service: Friendly and respectful (a lot of ma'am and sir greetings)  Items ordered: - Breakfast sandwich ($5.29) croissant, sausage, egg and cheese - The eggs was nicely scrambled and not runny or too hard. Add that to the buttery croissant and I'm a happy little camper.  - Breakfast sandwich ($5.29) baguette, gruyere (+.75), bacon, and egg. He enjoyed the eggs and that little extra crunch on the baguette bread. - Small (dirty) chai latte - Large iced coffee  Would I return: Yes.  Notes: - You order your sandwiches & drinks as the counter. If you'd like a pastry, you pick it up by the pastry showcase and bring it to the counter. - After order they give you one of those \"buzzer\" devices. Keep in mind it doesn't actually buzz. You're to pick a table and place it on the device so someone can bring you your items. - Keep you eyes open when you see a server in your area. Turns out some table devices got mixed up and your table number may not match what they see on their end. Having your server bring food to someone else table or find him/her wondering around annoucing your order number. -As much as I LOVE croissants and buttery goodness, my body sort of opposed and left me feeling a little upset. Don't worry, my body tends to veto unhealthy foods anyway. We've been in an on going fight for years now. Sadly I don't listen.",

The Decor is fun and funky, the coffee was very good too.

    "text": "I don't think I've ever been disappointed by Amelie's...other than soup prices so I don't buy it all the time.  Amelie's offers a variety of foods, sweets, and beverages.  This location is in the heart of uptown so it can get busy but every one there is great so you're not left wondering where your order is. The space is big, with a downstairs (and up) to the left side as you walk in. There was a bridal shower this particular day but you couldn't tell, it wasn't loud at all. You see a lot of people reading, or doing some sort of work on their laptops.   It's a very eclectic place with random decor. Nothing matches. Nothing at all... and I love it. It gives it character and it's a breath of fresh air in Charlotte, NC.  On this visit I skipped sweets (controlling my budget and waistline ), but got a cappuccino and their spinach artichoke soup. This may be my favorite soup of all time (well, one that my mom doesn't make anyways). It's light, full of veggies, and so flavorful. I cook a lot myself and knowing what I can spend to make a huge pot of soup sometimes compared to buying a bowl of this makes me cringe. I believe a bowl is about 5-6 dollars and I can't fathom spending so much on the regular. I'd rather try to make it at home for cheaper... a few trial and errors and I think I'll get close . We were in the area, it was chilly so I couldn't say no to soup and cappuccino .  Cappuccino was great, reasonably priced and not Starbucks. Thank god... I don't think I can take that burnt tasting coffee much longer.   Love this place, love the location, and love the vibe. Food is great, as are drinks. I wouldn't recommend going super hungry because you might buy all the sweets haha.  Definitely go if you're in town, you won't be disappointed.",

Was in the area for a meeting and decided to stop by at this place. I've been to the other location in NoDa, but have never been here. I expected it to be much smaller just because I know it's in the downtown area. So was very surprised to see the huge space and the same cute decor as the other location.   Got the brownies and salted caramel hot mocha to kick start my morning... Both were delicious!!! Decided to come back later that afternoon and brought my colleagues with me. All testified to the deliciousness of the brownies. So when they said they have sold over 100,000 brownies, they were not joking, people!   We also got several cakes. I think they were the vanilla strawberry cake and the berry cake. Not sure what the official name of the second one was. I thought they were just OK. The cream tasted a bit too buttery for me and there wasn't enough sweet/tarty taste that I expected from strawberry/berry cakes.   Loveeee the whimsical, cute decor. If I live in Charlotte, I would definitely make this my go-to bakery!",

I also bought 3 mini cakes and a lemon raspberry tart. These were decorated super cute (visually perfect) and were pretty yummy.

Try their Monte Cristo and if you can't/don't eat ham like me, sub it out for roast turkey and its still delicious. I love their pear tart and their chocolate raspberry tart, but you can't go wrong with any of their pastries. Lines are long but move quickly. Servers are hit or miss in terms of friendliness and helpfulness. And the decor is so cute!",

    "text": "I've wanted to go here so long and finally had the chance to go today.  So disappointing.  I don't know what everyone is raving about.  The decor is very cute, which I'd probably give a 4, but it all seemed dusty and unclean,  which I'll get back to in a moment.  We had the ham and gruyere, which was ok but was missing something like a spread or mustard.  We also had the bacon and brie, which was good, but needed more brie.  I got a latte... frankly I've had better coffee at Starbucks. I expect more from a real coffeehouse.  The flavor was flat plus it was only luke warm.  We also got a Napoleon,  eclair, and 3 macaroons.  The macaroons were decent, although quite large. I prefer smaller. But the flavor was good.  The eclair was fine, but nothing exciting and didn't seem super fresh.  I'm quite a good baker and can do better.  The Napoleon was not good.  I cannot stand when a Napoleon has anything other than pastry cream.  They use a combination of pastry cream and whipped cream for the filling, which is better than the places that just do whipped cream, but it is not a proper Napoleon.  I'm not a super -sweet dessert person anyways, but this filling lacked sugar.  The icing was a good flavor, but it was liquid instead of a thickened hard shell.  For food and atmosphere I'd have given a 3, but the real kicker is I see a barrista use the restroom and not wash her hands. Gross.  I won't be back.",

It was nice that they were open late, as I was staying in a hotel in the area and just wanted to get out for light snack. Desserts themselves were great - the peach tart was delicious, macaroon was perfect, and brownie was good but a little hard. That was the only one I didn't care to finish. Definitely a place I'll stop by again next time I'm in town, hopefully to grab some lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Becoming... NO, is a charlotte staple. I have frequent the original local on many occasions. I have seen bible study, women meeting, and girls hanging out, People with dyed hair, no hair, and wings, pre-med Student studying and groups catching up. This is an inclusive space and more importantly a safe one. I am actually a fan of their pastries although my friends would beg to differ. They love the savory soups and sandwiches. I started my Amelie affection based on the tart (hazelnut was my fav) but have shifted to their palmers, macrons and recently sticky buns. They have an eclectic variety of options made fresh daily and with that being said it can be hit or miss on the available options. Be open-minded while going as the prices are not for the faint of heart. The decor is cute and Parisian inspired which is a cute homage. Now that they have branched out I have found that there are more locations in and around charlotte and can always sneak in for a quite bite, download, coffee or chat with friends. I highly suggest you give it a try. Don't be surprised if you being to plan your next vacay to Paris. Bonjour!",

Apparently it's known for it's salted caramel brownie, which I ordered but found good, but overrated. I also had a chocolate layer cake with ganache, and that was the real star of the show. Yeah... I ate two sweets in one sitting. Don't judge me.  Also, outdoor seating was great-- perfect really. Indoor seating I found a little too loud for my tastes.

My goodness the pasteries were delicious and the sandwiches were great too, but there is one woman who works the front that is on the ball. The male cashier that rang us up was sitting down and very disinterested. Our coffe order left much to be desired too. It would be nice if there was more ecoutrements at the coffee station and raw sugar and nutmeg would be great. It is a great opportunity to see a professional pastry kitchen in full swing, there are giant plate glass windows to the kitchen for people to watch the chefs in action. Loved this! I highly recommend the napoleon for a sweet tooth. They are the best I've had in a very long time! This is a \"must go to\" if your in charlotte! I wonder if they ship to Texas? We don't have any french pastry shops in Central Texas.",

In glad we did.   The ordering can get a bit confusing, they weren't overly friendly, but not bad, and they didn't have crepes, even though it was on the menu board. Those are my reasons for not giving 5 stars.   The pros: the blueberry cream cheese muffin was probably the best one I've ever had! It was perfectly moist and flavorful. I ate more of it than my son did because I couldn't help myself!  I had the quiche which was perfectly flakey and delicious  My husband got a sandwich of some sort, o don't remember what it was but he loved it.

They also have 2 bars with beer and wine, and what seems like a LOT more food and drink options.  I had the salted carmel brownie latte and oh my gosh, best thing I've ever drank! If you're not a fan of sweet latte's obviously pass on this, but it was absolutely incredible! I can't say enough good things about this Amelies.
