So I just arrived from Miami on business and I am starving!  I decide to take a look at the local eateries for something a little different (heck, Im not paying for it!) when I came across this place.  The prices were great, and the way the food was described left me with a need to feed.  needless to say, I was sold! ...But then..I called to place my order...and was met to the sounds of a loud Indian man talking to someone else in a language I was not familiar with... shrugged it off and gave him my details...but when I gave him my order, he simply interrupted me and said something along the lines of...\" check the menu again, and call back...we dont have that..or we dont serve that\"...he wouldnt even wait to see if I would make another choice!!!  He wanted me to hang up and check the friggin menu again!!!  Needless to say I hung up the phone and decided to call Fortune Cookie II,.,,,better customer service over the phone, any day of the week!!!",

I'm not sure where the \"45 item\" came in? i didn't see that many...we had: -panipuri -some salad, and the most awesome red colored onion chutney  -naan -basmati rice -gobi aloo -bhindi masala -butter chicken -chili paneer -dosa -idli -sambar all of it was d-e-l-i-s-h..very authentic and very very good...great service, great food, great price...wknd dinner buffet for 2 for 26 including tax?? damn you can't beat that..  then again i'm used to paying 19.95 per person fora dinner buffet u stand in wait for 45 mins, and end up having to eat south indians trying to cook north indian food..and fudging up every dish.. ok enough venting - eat here, its good.",

First of all the ordering process is absurd; I even called back after ten minutes after placing my initial order as the person taking my order did not even ask for my hotel room number or contact number. I feel as though they need to increase the wait staff as they always seem overwhelmed. The food is okay, but this is my second time ordering and ecah time I ask for spice level very spicy and I get just over moderate. After having waited over one hour for my current order I called back to inquire as to the status and the receptionist said \"we have been busy that's why it's late\" so poor service is a total deal breaker for me. Not my problem you're understaffed.",

    "text": "We have had their Saturday buffet several times, and we think it is terrific in every regard.  It looks like they cater to a mostly Indian clientele, which is a good thing, so they don't hold back on the spices.  There is nothing I hate more than an anemic masala or vindaloo--not even Communism.  Everything is delicately seasoned--the nan bread, the main dishes, the mango lassi and desserts.  I think they have absolutely the best tandoori chicken I've ever eaten.  It was spot on.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here and want to go back soon.  There are mirrors on all the walls, so you get this Palace of Versailles \"Hall of Mirrors\" effect while you're eating.  You can watch yourself eat.  You can watch 12 of yourself eat.  You can watch EVERYONE eat.  Probably not something you want to see if you're dropping acid.  Ghee is lovely, lovely stuff.  They have a large selection of entrees--chicken, seafood, lamb, vegetarian dishes, appetizers, and lots of breads.  We've been here for sit down dinner and for the buffet; I think the buffet is the best bang for the buck.  The buffet desserts are fun, too: galub jamun, rice pudding, and falooda, an ice cream with mango and rose water toppings.  When we ordered dinner off the menu the first time, it was tasty, but they had a party in the back, and we felt sadly neglected by our server; but it's probably not like that every time.  I guess I'm the only one waiting to see a beef tikka masala in an Indian restaurant someday--I haven't given up hope!  I give this establishment 5 Ganesha trunks up.",

Today the order came out completely wrong and had to be redone. The shrimp tikka masala was made of rubbery chewy farmed fish and the medium heat was non existent. There was no spice involved. The tikka masala had no cream consistency to it today. It was very runny and overpoweringly tomato based.   The first experience I had merited 3 stars, the second time I ate there they qualified for 3.5 stars, and this last time they really went down to 1 star. I'm averaging them out at 2 stars after three tries.  I've exhausted my attempts. The inconsistency is too great and for the price they shouldn't be lacking at all. I will not eat here again.",

    "text": "My experience with this restaurant prompted me to join yelp and write my first review.  I just moved to uptown Charlotte and am dealing with some injuries (fractured distal femur and grade 2 ankle sprain) that has me ordering delivery some nights when I don't feel like preparing food or picking up.  With that being said, I don't think any restaurant or delivery driver needs the backstory to justify needing food delivered to your door.  I'm in a highrise uptown, people get delivery here all the time, and the concierge accommodates and sets the elevator for drivers...etc.  For some reason this guy put up the biggest argument about parking his car with hazards on and coming up to my room.  After 4 phone calls back and forth between the delivery driver and I (one hour after I ordered because whoever took my order wasn't able to decipher Pine from Tryon -_-) he was finally feeling assured enough to get out of the car... but not before 1 last call telling me that nobody was at the front desk and that I would need to come down after all.  So I call the concierge desk, and sure enough, somebody picked up...and let the guy in the elevator.  I lied, 1 more call was made when the guy was on my floor - asking the unit number...because my having made mention of the unit number before fell on deaf ears since nobody intended to come up to begin with. lovely.  I'll spare you the exchange.  It was lackluster and almost no words spoke in our ~25 second encounter.  THE FOOD.  I ordered Paneer Tikka Masala (spicy) and a Chicken Tandoori which I ended up having to order to meet the $30 minimum for delivery.  I didn't mind, I considered it a nice meal for the following day.  Paneer was not fresh, spice was adequate, but the overall taste was not something you come to expect after having paneer tikka masala's all around the world.  The Naans were standard, it's hard to mess that up.  The chicken tandoori which I got to the same night because I considered the paneer a wash, was totally lacking in flavor - almost as if it were chicken pieces with a red coating.  I don't expect much in the way of presentation, but you can do a little better than a few onions strips and a lemon wedge.  There seemed to be a huge language barrier when calling to order as well.  Like I had to repeat my phone number about 6 times...and I'm an American born Desi - so I'm very familiar with how to flavor my american accent with some desi tongue so those native to India and not as attune to our language (our language being english) can understand.  Half way through my order he asked me where in India I'm from (I said my father is from gujarat) and then we switched to Hindi for the rest of the call.  I had an advantage and still had trouble...yikes.  Annnyways, not ordering from there again.  Edit: One more thing.  The only other Indian restaurant I've tried in Charlotte in my ~1 month here so far is Copper.    So here's my review for Copper:    I had the Paneer Tikka Masala.  WOW.  ;)",

With classic dishes like Butter Chicken, Daal Makhni, Rogan Josh and Naan, this cuisine has taken the world by storm as it should. And Charlotte is no stranger to this cuisine. So when I saw Jaipur, rated higher than the other indian restaurants in the area, my sister and I decided to order take out. Let me preface this by saying the food was not bad! The butter chicken tasted like butter chicken, the samosas were crispy but not overdone and the biryani was also fine. Best tasting in the area? Definitely not but that's not the issue. The issue is how much they cheap you out of your meal and money. I counted THREE small pieces of lamb in my $17 lamb biryani. I essentially paid to eat a large bowl of yellow rice. Very disappointing. The raita (yogurt) was served in a small dip container. Will not be visiting/ordering again.",

I make my own Indian food at home and know the consistencies and the spices quite well. The lunch was sparse, the waiter friendly and attentive, but the food was meh. I only went there because I noticed that the lunch menu was decent priced, but when I got read y to pay he charged me a different amount than what their website states. I did not question it, but was disappointed as I do not like it if business owners do not update their websites as it feels like it is luring people in for a different price. If you are craving Indian food like me sometimes, do not waste your time and maybe head somewhere else. I wish I could support this place, particularly, because the owner/waiter is such a sweetie, but this place has seen better times and is def. not my favorite.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been going to the Jaipur for years. The food was always good and the service, while not fawning over you was at least civil. We just went again this evening. My wife's treat for my birthday. I always get the Lamb Korma and they do a very good job of keeping it mild, as that's the way I like it. The service was a bit disjointed this evening. We got there about 1/2 hour after they opened in the evening. They weren't really set up. We sat for about ten minutes before any water came. The two brothers that own and run the place were almost totally disconnected from the customers. One brother was complaining about the painful wrist joints he had, to another customer. This customer came in after we did and received priority service. My menu ordered food came and I had to wait for the plate to put it on. Usually the plate arrives 10 minutes before the food. I found that some of the subtler ingredients were missing from the Korma. There were no cashews or raisens in the sauce as is usual  for this Lamb Korma. Can't complain about the lamb though, it was loaded and quite good, considering some of the best ingredients were missing. My wife ate from the buffet and she was a bit disappointed as well. There was no itly; small, white, round things that is almost a staple in Indian restaurants. The daal was very watery, almost like a broth. The Kheer, which is like a rice pudding, was also missing a few of the subtle ingredients such as the cashew bits and the saffron and cardomom. My wife is Indian, so she knows what should be there and it is evident that they are cutting corners these days. The service is lacking, the original Indian dishes are lacking. This is too bad, because this was one of our 'go to' Indian restaurants. There used to be plenty of Indians whenever we went in, and these were lacking as well. Though there were plenty of Americans eating there which leads me to surmise that the are gearing their foods and ingredients toward the American palate. Americans may think they know Indian food but unless they have been exposed to a lot of authentic Indian food, they don't really know what they are getting. My wife cooks Indian food, she grew up in India. I have been to India twice and stayed with Indians and I ate the food they cooked and if we went out to eat, which wasn't very often, it was real, authentic, fire in the belly, Indian food. Sad to see the two brothers aren't as friendly and amiable as they used to be and they don't seem to have anyone working for them on the floor. Maybe they aren't making as much as they used to, but if this continues, I don't see them staying in business much longer. The ambiance is lacking a little but it is passable. The wife and I will have to double think our next visit. Again, it's too bad, to see a restaurant that stood out from the others, going downhill. Also my wife said the condiment bar, near the pani puri, was smelling of rotted food, not a nice accompanyment to a meal. Again, maybe not enough help in the place to clean like they should. I couldn't recommend this place any more, like I used to. After this visit, I had to share with yelp. I really liked this place but time has done it's job.",

Everything was bland and oily, and we had queasy stomachs for hours after.   Dosa was, by far, the best item on the buffet. Chicken Tikka Masala was neither sweet nor spicy enough. Bhaigan Bhurtha was the strangest consistency - baby food puree - with no noticeable smokiness or flavor that I'd typically expect. Mutter Paneer was flavorless. The Pani Puri / chaat bar was nice to have, although each ingredient was not well executed. The green and coconut chutneys were good.   It was interesting to find a dinner buffet, and the price is great. If you've never eaten Indian food and you worry about it being too spicy, this place might be worth a try.",

Service was mediocre, about what I expect from a small indian joint.  Oh - I went thinking that the buffet would be available for dinner, but it was not.  Slow night? Does it not run at night?

The decor/ambiance immediately tell you that you're in an Indian restaurant, specifically the smell of incense and the Indian music which I like as part of the experience.  The menu boasts a wide variety of chicken, lamp, seafood and vegetarian dishes as well as an assortment of Indian breads to go with your meal. I ordered the Bhindi Bhaji which is a spiced sauteed okra with tomatoes and onions. It was perfect with the tandoori roti bread (buttered, of course). All of that with the basmati rice was more than enough. My regret was that I didn't order it spicier (he suggested medium but probably did so assuming that I couldn't handle it - will have to correct that next time) - if you like spicy, be sure to convey that. Glad I came and hope to return soon.",

No spicey!\" He said ok. \"I said neither chicken or soup I don't want it spicy please.\" He said yes. I also ordered a bottle of water. I paid $25 plus tip! I paid like $30! In return my order comes like an hour later. Rice is cold. Both chicken and soup are sooo spicy my mouth burns. I can't eat them. No water! The water I paid for didn't even come. I call and text nobody responds! Finally a guy responds and says well its Indian food it's spicy. I said I was clear I didn't want it spicy he should have told me that earlier. Then as I was saying they also forgot my water bottle, he hung up on me! hUnG up on a client who just got scammed $30 with cold rice, super spicy food and no water. I am still hungry and thirsty now.

It has no windows so I refused to try them until today in hopes of finding an Indian gem near my work...  WOW...  no.  Dark, hot, dirty and old...  and none of which in a \"good\" way - LOL  There are mirrors on all the walls that make it feel \"trippy\" inside... and again- not in a good way.  The sanitation grade was a 90, and the floor actually moves and creaks loudly as you walk on it.  There's what appears to be a storage area directly beside the entrance complete with items piled against each other.?.  If that's what they choose to showcase by the front door, then I'm afraid to ask what they might be showcasing in the kitchen where I can't see.   The buffet was as far from the area we were seated as possible, which I thought as weird since the place wasn't full.  Again- what was the reason (that I don't know) for this?  The selection was miserable complete with mismatched hand written signs that didn't coordinate with what was in the dish.  The Riaita had some sort of round orange colored balls in it that gave it an oddly sweet taste = yuck!  We had to chase the only waiter down to get our drinks half way through our meal and then it was a canned coke?  Really?  When we walk to the register to pay, the same waiter asked how things were and then asked us to please return.  Clearly they're struggling a bit, because successful restaurants don't usually have to beg people to return... the food and ambiance should do that on it's own.  I realize there aren't a ton of Indian places to choose from, but there are certainly enough to bypass this one, which would be my recommendation to everyone.",

The vegetarian dishes that I did try included a kidney bean dish that was a new try for me and tasty, a ground eggplant dish that I also liked, and a slightly bland cauliflower and potato (gobi aloo) dish.  I added some of the near-perfect onion chutney to the latter.  I liked the relatively low salt content of this food.  It was refreshing.  I also endorse the condiment bar.  They even had a dish of raw chilies.  Not perfect, but worth the money.  The man working the front of the house (a part-owner?) was friendly and helpful.",

That being said, I gave Jaipur 3 stars because I can tell they put ready-made flavor powders, instead of a roasted and ground combination of spices that we do at home.  In any case, I am a repeat patron here and will continue to be as long as I crave Indian food outside my home.  I always go for the buffet, just cause I like to have a little bit of everything they have.  We have come to know the owners very well over the past 4 years that Ive lived here.  I also know when the regular chef is off, because I can immediately tell the watered down or off tasting curries.    Good food, good service, very weird seating arrangement and also location is a bit questionable.  Sandwiched between a bi-lo and a sally's beauty supply.",

This was my first Indian food experience and I have came back on many occasions. I always come for the lunch buffet (M-F 11-2:30, S-S 12-3) and they always have a big selection. They boast that they have 45 items which I am sure includes the condiments because there are usually only 10 main dishes (50% vegetarian). The Naan is some of the best I have had.  They have a big menu for lunch or dinner (Tandoor, Chicken, Lamb, Seafood and Vegetarian).  If you have never had Indian food I would highly recommend this place for your first meal.",

He also gave me a sauce I had never tried to accompany the biryani. SO good!   The naan was also amazing, some of the best naan I have had.  Stopping here made my whole work trip worth it!

The Bengali chef is not cutting any corners - everything is spiced to perfection with the right balance of heat, spice, and oil.   The masala chai tasted like something you'd buy off of a chai wallah in the streets of any city in India. Very few people actually make real Indian chai in the US, so, this is pretty special.  The meats were succulent, melt in your mouth texture.  As an added bonus, our buffet came with 2 pieces of fresh of the tandoor naan and 2 potato dosas.  Service and ambiance are fair. The hole-in-the-wall atmosphere was actually charming in it's own way and authentically Indian. Very excited to become a regular at Jaipur.",

    "text": "I went into Jaipur today to get two takeout lunches for myself and my son. When I walked in I was greeted by an older gentleman whom I presumed to be the owner. I told him I would like takeout from the buffet. His demeanor immediately changed and he hemmed and hawed until finally saying \"yes ok\". He disappeared and then came back with a takeout box when he proceeded to tell me he would have to prepare the box for me and it will be $9. I said that is fine and I will need two to go. He looked even more perturbed and begrudgingly got another box. I said I don't want everything on the buffet so he gave me the box and dared to let me pick out my own food. However, he followed me and watched closely, insisting that I \"need more rice\". I layered the bottom of the container with rice and then literally put one scoop each of the four vegetarian dishes and two meat dishes from the buffet. I did not even get any of the tandoori chicken. I closed the box and when I asked him for the second takeout box he said to me \"no, you can only take one\". I then said \"but I need two\" and he again said no. I handed him the box I had previously prepared and said \"keep it then\". I can almost guarantee that he probably emptied that container back into the buffet. I have never been to this restaurant before and have no idea if the food is good or not, but if you have to treat your customers this way then perhaps you're in the wrong business and should go to work for the government instead. I will not be going back and am happy to spread the word.",

Gulab jamoon was very mild, the syrup should be more thick. The rice pudding was very good though, so was nan and dosa that were served hot on table. Biriyanis are more like pulao. I did not taste veg curries, so can't comment on that. Lamb curry was sub par. However, the hospitality was good.",

Jaipur happened to be on my route home that day (thanks Yelp!), so I decided to give it a try. I called my order in and the man who picked up was very polite and very nice, and answered my questions with some good suggestions on their dishes. I know my popular Indian dishes, but I always like to try something new.   The place is super easy to find. It's in one of those big shopping plazas, but their sign is huge and glowing - hard to miss. Bonus is that parking is a total breeze. So I rode that breeze right on in and was greeted immediately. My order was ready right on time, and they were very careful to wrap and place everything so nothing would spill.   On to the food... Naan was awesome. Perfect mix of light and dense with this bread. Nobody likes a super dense naan. It should be fluffy and easy to tear with one hand if you're eating properly!  The dishes were wonderful. The meat was cooked perfectly and fall-off-the-bone tender, in the case of the goat curry that I ordered. I'm not a fan of goat, unless it's cooked Indian-style. Then suddenly goat is the top of my food wants. The sauces were 3/5. I would have liked to see (and taste) more spices in the food, but it was more than acceptable. I think I was most impressed by the abundance of food in the sauce. There are few things more disappointing than a bowl brimming with tikka masala only to have like 5 pieces of meat in it. I was very happy with the portion sizes here. Definitely worth the money!  Besides the spices, the one thing Jaipur could improve on is to have brown rice as an option. I know that's not typical for restaurants, but a few of the other places in Charlotte do offer brown rice. hint hint...  Otherwise, for their dishes alone, I would not hesitate to come back.",

    "text": "Jaipur has long been my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte.  I took my girlfriend there for the first time on Friday for dinner and it blew us away.  I guess on Friday nights they do a buffet which we chose not to get, but it had the one manager/server hopping the entire time we were there.  Despite the fact he was taking care of basically the entire restaurant, he paid amazingly close attention to us and was extremely gracious.  To wit, he started us with a complimentary appetizer of pakora, which was absolutely delicious.  I had the lamb rogan josh, Indian hot.  She had paneer tikka masala.  I got some garlic cheese naan, and she got just some regular naan.  Both of our dishes were outstanding.  I can't help but order lamb every time I eat Indian food so I'd never tried their paneer before, but I stole a bite of hers and it was excellent.  My own dish was fantastic as well - a generous portion of lamb cubes in a delicious sauce.  Of course, the jasmine rice was terrific and perfectly seasoned, and the naan was excellent as usual.  After we were finished, he then came by and gave us a complimentary dessert of what were listed as \"sweet balls\" - and boy, were they.  Basically donut holes in some sort of syrupy glaze (I'm guessing corn syrup was involved), they were intensely sweet...a bit too much so for me, but my girlfriend loved them.  The food was terrific as usual and the service, while never disappointing in the past in any way, simply blew me away this time.  I will absolutely continue to visit Jaipur any time I need to scratch that itch.",

    "text": "I only got one item and it is entirely possible that I ordered the worst thing on the menu.  Keep that in mind when you read my review.  I didn't get the buffet and that is on me - it seems the buffet may have been a better experience.  I ordered off the menu and was disappointed - that is on Jaipur Indian Restaurant.  I changed my mind, not getting the buffet isn't on me.  A restaurant shouldn't offer 2 star options.  I refuse to accept that I am fool who didn't get the buffet, I can order whatever I want and if it is on the menu then Jaipur Indian Restaurant is responsible for making it the best possible meal.  I got the korma and I was disappointed.  I finished it, but that was because the portion was so small.  Small portions here worked because I didn't want to even bother with the leftovers, why not?  The meal was boring and bland.  I enjoy all food, but I didn't enjoy this more than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  I usually get a bit euphoric from a good meal and Indian food tends to get me there.  The visuals weren't appealing, lack of garnish and the serving dishes were bland, none of this was helped by the feel of the plates and silverware.  The neighborhood of this place is one where I wouldn't be found after sunset and before sunrise.  I was eating with a friend of mine and we had a coupon - so we got a reasonably cheap deal.  Had I been eating alone I would have gotten up and left.  I would first make sure to tell the proprietor I didn't want to pay for or even take another bite of the meal.  I would then ask if I had to pay and if I did then I would pay.  I had great company and a disappointing meal.  It wasn't that the meal itself was so bad, it was that there are so many other Indian restaurants that I know of that are so good.  Every bite was a reminder that I wasn't at the right place for me.  I felt foolish for trying something new.",

    "text": "How is this place still in business? This has been by far the worst experience I've ever had at an Indian restaurant.   I came for lunch buffet with a friend since my usual spot decided to start closing on Mondays. The reviews here were hit or miss but for $8, figured I wouldn't lose much.   Soon as we walked in, a man on the phone motioned us to a table with a sweep of his arm. No greeting, no questions, still talking on the phone, just a finger pointing us to a table. He poured us each a glass of water but never asked if we wanted anything else. Guess cause he was too busy on the phone which he stayed on the duration of our visit.   We walked up to the buffet stand and immediately looked back at the man with a \"You've got to be kidding me\" expression on our faces. There was rice, 2 pieces of naan, 4 veggie dishes and 3 chicken dishes. That's it. That's the buffet. The rest of the buffet dish spots were empty. I thought, for $8, I'll just eat my fill. Now on to the food itself.   Veggie curry was mush. No flavor, just a bland sauce with over cooked veggies you couldn't tell apart. The cauliflower dish was also mushy. There was a spinach and mushroom dish I've never seen before. It was not good. Mushrooms were gummy. Now the chicken - there was chicken masala that lacked cream and was watered down. Seriously, it was just orange water. The chicken curry was a weird shade of brownish green, not the vibrant red you'd expect. Then the tandoori chicken - bland. It had a reddish hue but no flavor, not even salt. The meat was dry and you could tell it's leftovers from a previous day. The naan was made fresh but it was thick and gummy. I've had better naan from Walmart. We asked if there was any samosas and he brought us each one. The potatoes were mushy (seems to be a theme) and again, there was no flavor. Even the tamarind and mint sauces were watered down.   Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, we went to pay and was told the total is $21. For water and two $8 plates, it didn't add up right. That's when we were told there's an extra charge for the samosas. We weren't told that it when it was ordered, only when we went to pay. That's crazy. We left feeling unsatisfied and won't ever be back there again.",

The restaurant is in the wedge of a shopping center on South Blvd near Food Lion. It looks like it actually takes up 2 spaces because they are at two different levels. The right side is a step down than the left side.    The menu is quite broad and it was difficult making a decision but service was so slow here that we had plenty of time to decide.   I went with the Curry chicken and I was able to sample some of the other dishes at our table including Chilli Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Once the meals arrived, they were all delicious. The herbs and spices were easily identified and the heat levels were just enough to make your mouth and lips tingle for a few minute - just the way I like it.  One of our group ordered two desserts - the Gulab Jamun and Kheer. Her trick was to mix them together and that was delicious as well.  All of the food was wonderful. The service is what is bringing this down to a 3-star rating. We were a group of 4 and they weren't very busy and it took 2 1/2 hours to get out of there.  So don't go there if you are in a hurry...go there and enjoy the food.",

However we went there for dinner tonight and had an experience worthy of getting the figurative pen and paper out.   We entered shortly after they opened and we were promptly greeted by a very friendly middle aged man. Not sure if he is the owner because I have seen him here every time I visit. After reviewing the menu we decided to splurge and get the Maharajah feast for two.   We started with mixed vegetarian appetizers and it was fun to sample a little bit of everything. I knew I was in trouble during this course - we had just started dinner and I was already getting full. Everything on the vegetable appetizer plate was fried which was good but heavy. The meat appetizer plate came out next and the lamb was my favorite. I am super picky about lamb and it is a testament to how delicious it was.   Next our mains came out - the chicken tikka masala, chicken bhuna and the mixed vegetable curry. The chicken tikka masala was full of wonderful spice with creamy aspect to cut the heat. The man who greeted us served the entire meal and made sure to offer us additional nan and rice. Like we needed any more food at this point!  We ended with a delicious kheer which I could only take a couple bites of since I was so stuffed. There was plenty leftover to take for lunch tomorrow. The service was attentive and the food absolutely delicious. I would recommend this for anyone craving Indian.",

Owner was patient and kind and made sure to have fresh naan delivered after walking in!!! Not mad at 11 bucks for lunch buffet either!",

    "text": "This place was recommend to me by a subscriber from my YouTube channel which I randomly do Food Reviews on. The subscriber stated they wanted to see me eat something different and gave me two Indian Restaurants. So today I made the trip, camera in tow of course and lets say this was a different experience for sure. As I entered The Jaipur Indian Restaurant was pretty chill, Indian music placing in the background and a clean environment . The owner was kind and so helpful, he took the time out to figure out something I would be able to eat without it being too spicy, overall it was a very pleasant experience. While there I ate the Curry chicken and the lamb biryani (fried rice) Roti (flat bread) and a special mango drink the owner made for me. All of the food was flavorful, the fried rice was a tad on the greasy side but it was still decent, the flat bread was simply amazing and the mango drink was smooth and tasty. Overall for this being my first experience I feel it was a pretty decent outing. I may give it another try someday if i'm in the area.    Black_Walter_",

As we went to pay we got charged for drinks we didn't order. Corrected him. He apologized. Still charged us a total with them in there. When I questioned it he abruptly rushed me off that the buffet was that price.   Seriously? Is honesty such a problem? :(  Definitely will not be going back. Charge what you must but this, this is just sad.   Oh and clear tables. Nothing more unwelcoming than dishes pilled up all over. Yuck.   NTS. Don't try a place on a whim. It's not worth it.",

The temperature of the buffet food was luke warm, which if it would have been hot probably would have tasted much better. The white rice and biriyani were not good at all no flavors of authentic biriyani and white rice didn't taste fresh. Just a heads up Indian food is one of my FAVS and have had my fair share of all different kinds of North and South Indian food at homes and in restaurants! It would be a good place for people trying Indian food for 1st time so you can try a couple different dishes. The tandoori chicken was yummy..... On a good note, The chicken in the curry and butter chicken was cooked perfectly and fell apart easily with a fork. Also the samosa were really good but a little small.",

    "text": "My review is slightly biased because I visit this restaurant with one of my business partners, whom frequents so I get VIP treatment each time.  I've only visited two authentic Indian restaurants in Charlotte. However, I've also studied abroad in India for 1 looong month. Jaipur was where we stayed for a period of our visit so I couldn't wait to check this place out. It's authentic Indian food for sure. The buffet options are usually the same with a few different things added here or there.  The food is definitely one of the best I've had in Charlotte so far! The spread is always fresh and has just enough for an indecisive foodie, like myself.   There is plenty of seating space. It is much older decorum and the space is smaller than other locations I've seen; however, it's plenty of room for families. Bonus* They have an awesome Valentine's day special and the space is gets cozy and comfortable.  The service was quick and the server, Owner, was attentive. His attention to detail makes me a loyal customer. I'd drive 20min. + for this. In fact, I'll probably be back sooner than I planned.",

They have a lunch buffet everyday and a dinner buffet on Friday and Saturday nights (maybe Sunday too). I want to come back because for $14 it looked (by the tag names) to be a lot of variety and I'd really like to explore the rest of the menu. In fact, that is the only reason it is not a five star, I found the solo item to be a bit pricey from what I've paid in other places. But the taste did hit right on. And it's convenient to my house. When the craving hits, I'll be back. 100% The guy who was running the place that evening was super conversational and very friendly.",

We ordered one medium spicy and one extra spicy and you could really tell the difference! I appreciated that. I'm a fan of super spicy food and they really deliver here.

Instead of braving the crowds at the newly opened Tandur Indian Kitchen in SouthPark we called in an order of tikka masala, saag paneer, lamb samosa, chicken pakora, and some naan. We called ahead, they said it would be 20 minutes, and I arrived with five minutes to spare, thinking I could pay and be ready to go back home ASAP. It appears there was only one person in the kitchen and one person out front.   Not the worst Indian food I've had, but I was disappointed in the low volume of cheese in our saag paneer. I imagine the experience for a lunch buffet is more positive, but takeout dinner simply didn't make me want to return. The reviews are decidedly split. There are plenty of other options for food in this part of South Blvd - check out Burrito Factory, Crispy Banh Mi, or Jasmine Grill.",

We ordered chicken vindaloo, some chicken tikka masala, samoas an order of the naan bread. Ordered a bit late and they assured us we would have our meal within 40 minutes, and I have to tell you it was definitely worth the wait. The portion size was huge, and the food was hot and flavourful. The vindaloo had the right amount of heat, and the tikka masala, was wonderful, and there was more than enough food for a second meal, although I ate my vindaloo like it was my last meal.   The food came with utensils, and plates, which made it all the better and I will order from here again for sure, the next time I am in Charlotte.",

Almost everything I searched was pointing me to Uptown, going against my instinct I found this little restaurant at the bottom of the review page.  I decided to give it a go.    I am all about Indian food and was willing to try any place, including this one that is located in a shady looking shopping center.  I was surprised, as soon as I walked in I was greeted by every employee and seated.  I went with chicken buryani, chicken tikka, saag paneer, and chicken curry, with a large helping of bread.  I was impressed, I was glad I had chosen a buffet and knew I would be helping myself to seconds.  The service was great, even though they were busy, I never had an empty glass in front of me.  The price was exrtremely reasonable and the quality of food was top notch; its a shame I don't live in Charlotte, otherwise I'd be a regular.",

    "text": "This Indian Restaurant used to be the go-to restaurant for my wife and I. After 8 months we returned and I have to say, we will be looking for a new favorite Indian Restaurant. The two brothers that run this place don't seem to be able to retain wait staff. They used to be a lot friendlier and pleasant. Seems that the years are starting to take their toll. The food is still fairly good. My main entree was spot on and was delicious. The side items are a different matter. I ordered Naan with my meal. It seemed to be just rushed through with only a little dab of butter in the center on top. Most naan is brushed liberally with butter. This seems like they just don't care. When we came in, my wife was told that \"we like people to come in, eat, and then get out, no hanging around.\" REALLY??? This makes people want to come back? The surly attitude and rushed service because they can't keep help, so only one person on the floor to tend the customers, this makes people want  to come back? Questioning why you want a receipt when they noticed that you ate liberally at the buffet? Isn't that the idea of a buffet? And while we are on about the buffet, the choices offered seem to have diminished quite a bit. No idlee??? A staple of Indian meals and they don't have it??? This makes people want to come back? I think Jaipur has had it's better days and is now on the downward slope to obscurity. For a Saturday night, the place used to be packed, now they were struggling to keep four tables full. They only had one dessert choice where they used to have about three or four. The crockery isn't very clean, I had to search to find a clean bowl. Does the Health Dept. visit here any more? No, I think we'll start searching elsewhere as this place has hit the wall for service, choice, friendliness and shortness of staff. Two in the kitchen and one on the floor, that's it! There are a lot of Indian Restaurants in town these days, we'll just have to make the rounds. Aljo Jaipur.",

As a transplant from San Francisco, I was surprised at the prices -- comparable to higher-end SF Indian restaurants and nowhere near the tastiness.  Had two dishes: Chicken Makhani and a saag dish. Nothing knocked me out, but all was fine.  The second time we went there, last week on my birthday, we ended up walking out before they took our order. The waitress was in the weeds with only 2 tables and seemed to be preoccupied with computer problems.   After sitting unacknowledged at our table for 15 minutes we finally left. If she'd made some sort of motion to let us know she'd be over we might have been more understanding, but we were hungry and not in the mood to be ignored.",

I say this for the customer service and atmosphere. It's a family owned establishment and you are treated just like one.   I have tried their weekly buffet lunch and their weekend buffet dinner. I would love to go for a non buffet, but the food, selection, and price for the buffet is so good I just can't pull myself away from it:) The lunch buffet isn't as good as the dinner though, but I think that is because it isn't as busy. At least the times I have gone that's the way it's been.   For the weekend dinner they offer appetizers, soup, 2 different kinds of rice, naan, and multiple dishes, plus desserts. For 2 dinner buffets, large Kingfisher for about $30! Who can beat that??? To say I need a wheel barrel to leave the establishment is an understatement.   We even had our Xmas din din here. It was absolutely packed and it put the biggest smile on my face to know that this wonderful place gets the support and the recognition it deserves. I am proud to write this and to verbally tell people if they are looking for wonderful Indian cuisine this is the place to get it.  Yummers!",

    "text": "Delivery takes a very long time! The food was okay, but nothing special. I was told it would take 45-50 min. An hour later, I called again and was told the food was on the way and would arrive in 5-10 minutes. Finally, an hour and a half after placing my order, the food arrived. But it was not worth the wait. They should really be upfront about the delivery time instead of misleading customers.",

    "text": "I can only attest to the lunch buffet. First of all, the price is right. After tax it is $8.75. Between this and the one on King's Drive, it's pretty much my 2 go-to for Indian lunch buffet. Jaipur has good naan, a tomato soup that goes well with them, and the little fried chickpeas patties that are very tasty. There are typically at least 4 entrees options (vegetarian & chicken mostly) plus the must have tandoori chicken. This is a solid quick lunch spot when you're craving a little Indian.",
