Granted, most restaurants will have some days that are better than others.  That being said, our experience was nothing short of excellence last night. We had no issues getting a parking space but it was a Thursday evening. We sat at the bar area per our request. The dining room had lots of empty tables but on this particular occasion, we wanted to be near the action. There was a guy playing the guitar and singing some of the older songs that was very good.  But on to the service, beer and food. I will start with the service. Our waitress approached our table as soon as we were seated and was very helpful in our selection from the huge list of draft beers. No wait for a cold draft tonight! She was very observant and acknowledged our request to wait to order our food. When the time came, we placed our order for the Fish Taco's with their signature chips and the Chicken Caesar Wrap with French Fries. The food quickly arrived and was all very fresh. The fries were piping hot. The Fish Taco's were very good as was the Chicken Caesar Wrap. I really do not have anything bad to say about our experience at all. We would definitely visit here again if in the area.",

    "text": "I haven't been to this Hickory Tavern in years.  We used to go hit buckets of balls next door and then swing over for some drinks and dinner.  The years have been fine to this location, it was just as I remembered.  Located at the end of Rea Crossing shopping center just past the 485 exits on Providence Rd, if you are heading towards Waxhaw, it will be on your right.  If you are leaving the shopping center during peak drive times, or would rather not cross 4 lanes of Providence Rd, you can drive behind the gas station and hang a left, which will take you to a stoplight for safe crossing.  I was greeted by the hostess and after asking not to sit at a high top (I realize I am alone and will take up a table probably meant for 4, but I typically have on a skirt and no one wants to see that while they are trying to eat) I got a little bit of an eye roll, but that's okay.  Some girls get mad at how pretty I am, so I am used to eye rolls (ha).  Hickory Tavern is FULL of large flat screen TV's and usually have whatever the prime viewing for the time is on a huge projection screen on a rear wall.  When I was in around 6 on a Thursday night, it was SportsCenter (da na na) so I could read the crawl along the bottom of the screen.  I was quickly greeted by my server, Katlyn, and she was fantastic - my drink was kept filled and she checked up on me periodically without helicoptering around me.  As I put in my Tip for this location, I believe she said on Thursdays that shrimp were $.60 and oysters were $.75, bit since I don't eat either, I wasn't exactly tuned in.  The table next to me got oysters and he commented that they were tasty.    The food: Turkey Club w/ Tavern chips ($9.50):  Turkey with melted cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato, served warm.  The bread, if you are a Costco person, is one of their torta rolls that are deee-licious.  The sandwich was good, and I like that it was served warm, but it needed a little more flavor to it.  Maybe next time I will ask for a side of BBQ sauce or the like to punch it up a bit.  The house made chips were thick sliced potato chips, crispy, but not hard and served with a slightly spicy dipping sauce - they were good and not overly salty, which was perfect.   Key Lime Cheesecake ($6.95):  This tasted like another Queen City Pastry dessert and was delicious.  Served with several swirls of whipped cream, this light key lime cheesecake, on a graham cracker crust, with a thin layer of lime sauce on top, was the perfect somewhat light dessert the finish the meal.    Excellent service and the food was slightly above average for this type of restaurant.  As it is close to home, I shall return.",

The oreo cheesecake and the tiramisu cheesecakes are especially good.  They do offer trivia on Wednesday nights where you can win gift certificates (and apply them to your bill that night).

They have recently bumped up their prices on menu items, and it just ruins the value equation of eating here.  I would recommend going on a day when they have specials (you can visit their website, or call in to find out what the specials are).  If you are a chicken person I highly recommend the California Chicken sandwich (I would leave off the mushrooms), and a baked potato.  The break gets a little soggy so you may have to \"Fork n Knife\" it but its only because the chicken is very juicy!  The baked potato is delicious and comes with a salted skin which goes great with a side of sour cream.  Beer/Alcohol can get pricey here if its not on special, but they do have a good selection.  They have TVs everywhere so we enjoy going when there is a game on, the atmosphere is great on these days.",

The crowd here was really young, but that's probably because they were all home from college seeing their high school friends again. The bar has a great TV situation--we were sitting at a table in the dining area but still had a perfect view of UNC losing to UNLV. Womp.  We had 20 oz Blue Moons on special and a half-order of nachos. I love nachos (side note: I have gross eating habits) but these were pretty unimpressive. They should consider using liquid queso as the cheese base so the other ingredients don't get inextricably glued to the chips on top.",

    "text": "So I am a frequent customer at different hickory taverns. I visited the one on providence road since I live near by to watch the Yankees vs Astros then after a NHL hockey game which I had watched there a week before. Brooke was very sweet, nice and attentive and was excellent. However the gentleman who was controlling the TVs was not. I asked towards the end of the Yankees game if they could put on the New Jersey Devils game since on the tv next to it was European soccer that nobody was as watching. We were told that they couldn't put the game on because playoff baseball and college football was on however once the Yankees were over they'd change the channel. Once the Yankees game ended I asked if they could put on the game and the guy was hesitant. He walked over and then came back saying that he couldn't put it on because they didn't have the NHL package... first of all don't lie to me. I understand people staying there for a while sometimes can hurt business and all that however had they put the game on we would have spent more money and even invited others to do watch the game. It really seemed like the guy just didn't want to put the game on because it wouldn't be appealing to others that were there. There are over 20 TVs and I can't have one at the bar to watch a hockey game? Also if you're not going to put on the game at least be honest with me... don't lie to my face and say you don't have something when I know for a fact that you do... needless to say I will never return to this location again.",

The menu is typical bar food - not great but not bad either. I am always a fan of oysters and they offer them on the half shell.... yay!  They do have a nice patio that I like to enjoy when weather permits.   Service on my visits has been hit or miss. I have been several times when it is really crowded and it can be a challenge to get served.  However, on visits when it was not so busy, the service was very good.   In addition to all of the TVs for the sports fans, they also have live music on occasion.  The overall atmosphere is comfy and laid back but I think a little nicer than many sports bars.",

After she gave us the check, she disappeared again. After waiting ten minutes for her to return, we finally had enough and found another waitress to run our card. I don't know what happened tonight, but it was the worst service I have ever experienced. There is another Hickory Tavern a few miles up the road.

I started working with Heather planning the dinner. She was so great to work with from start to finish. Our group started with a appetizer buffet, the wings were A+! The dinner followed and I could not have asked for better fare. Service wise Cody and Erin could not have done a better job. Being an author, former professional basketball player and college coach I have ate out a lot for most of the past 25 years and I can honestly say I have never had better service than what Cody and Erin gave us last night. The appetizers were on time and fresh, the main dinner came right on time. The ladies kept up with 30 peoples beverages without a hitch. Any special request we had in the room, they took care of immediately. If I owned a restaurant I'd be hiring these two away. (Give them both a pay increase, they deserve it) Thanks to Heather, Cody, and Erin our dinner was even more special than I had imagined!",

If I want to grab a beer or more and watch the game, the bar is well lit, the music isn't too loud to talk, and the sports selection is plentiful.  The food is great, sized just right with something for everyone.  I typically go for their burgers which are delish.",

There were multiple tables open in the bar area but they would not allow me to be seated without waiting 20 minutes. This has been an issue the last few times I've been to this location. I've heard a few others complain about the issue as well. The servers even laugh about it saying how ridiculous it is. This place is a sports bar after all, you should be able to walk in and grab a seat if open.  Not the case at all here. Not sure who's grand idea it was to have a wait in a bar that's not full?  It would be worth a 7 minute drive to Ballantyne or Matthews to avoid dealing with ignorance.  I give 2 stars just because I know what they are capable of. I've been going to hickory taverns in Asheville and Ballantyne for a few years now and have enjoyed them. This location doesn't seem to understand how to function properly.  Watching the hostesses freak out the entire time is not very attractive either. The poor girls have no clue what's going on and the managers watch and pretend everything is going well.  Hopefully this place figures things out because if not there will be plenty of place to go across the street in the next year or so with the big development coming in.",

The chips and salsa came out cold and a little stale. There was also a small piece of old chicken underneath the chips. The chicken tenders came out dark and overcooked on the outside and a little undercooked on the inside. Our server took it back and the manager came out to apologize. She said they didn't bread it correctly and the outside burnt. They gave us new chips and tenders, which were much better. I was a little surprised they didn't comp or discount anything. It wasn't a terrible experience, but it wasn't my best either.",

Not too long after I was able to order lunch which included chicken tenders and a baked potato. You can chose for the chicken tenders to be plain or tossed in sauce, or for a side sauce bbq or honey mustard. On the baked potato comes butter, sour cream, chives, cheese and bacon. I only got butter on mine, but note you will have to ask for it on the side if that is your preference.   The food didn't take too long to come out. Once we got it I'm pretty sure my coworker was totally jealous of mine because it looked awesome. And it was. I definitely had enough to take home and have for lunch the following day.   The only hiccup during our meal was when I asked the waitress for butter she said ok and left. I am pretty sure she totally spaced because when I asked her again she said ok, but this time she brought it out.   I would recommend for lunch, hopefully dinner service is just as good.",

Food is always great, been eating here for years, but I have literally been put on hold for 5-10 mins every time I try to get takeout....I've complained to managers and made complaints online.  Nothing.  Walked in being on hold for 10minutes tonight, place is half empty.  Showed host and manager my phone on hold. Mgr said it will be brought up in the manager meeting tomorrow, 9/20. I sure hope it is because it's crystal clear that hosts are instructed to send takeout orders to the bar and bartenders are instructed to wait on all of the customers and do every other possible thing before answering the phone.   If the bartenders are too busy have the host take the freaking to go orders. All they do is take people to their seats.  It's been a trend for the last year at the providence location and one time I called the Ballantyne location since no one would pick up at providence I had the same issue and complained to mgr there as well.  Not everyone can make it in there to eat. Some people have families and small children. Stop telling your bartenders to wait so long to answer to go orders. It is clearly obvious that that is what they are being told by the trend I've seen. Listen to what we are telling you and make an attempt to appease all customers. your food is great but your service sucks in continues to suck and clearly nothing is being done about it.   Please read this and do something bout it.  I downloaded yelp to do this because it has been happening over and over and over again.  It's not all about money.

    "text": "I've been to a few Hickory Taverns around the Charlotte area and this one is by far the best.  The location is in the fast growing Ballantyne area and rests next to the Charlotte Golf Links course.  Perfect for playing 18 and strolling over to the bar.    The bar/patio/restaurant areas are large and loaded with places to sit for the busy times.  Personally, I prefer the bar area for everything and it has always worked out well.  We've eaten the wings, lobster roll, and the homemade chips and loved everything (Wings - nice and crispy with numerous sauce choices).  They do a very good job of using fresh bread and ingredients for their sandwhiches.  The best meal was the Chicken Avocado sandwich.  Very healthy and very flavorful.    The only reason that I held off on the 5th star was the beer selection.  I thought it was rather lacking on the draft choices.  Other than that, they have great daily drink specials and surprisingly delicious oyster days.  TVs and large projection screens on every corner and wall -- I cant ask for anything more than that.    Having said all that, you pretty much get what you see here.  Big Sports bar with quality service, food, and atmosphere.   Enjoy!    -Ian M.",

The atmosphere was very cool and a  extremely busy tavern.  The menu was full of great meals and appetizers.  There was a variety of \"hogies\" and I ordered the French Dip and Queso Dip as an appetizer.   Our waitress was Jennifer and she was extremely precise in her serving us.  We had a party of ten and the drinks were brought out first thing.  She took our order at the same time and the appetizer was brought next and very good.  After the appetizer our food was brought our within 5 minutes and it looked excellent.   The presentation of everyone's food was perfect.    The only thing I didn't care for was the lack of shaved prime rib in my sandwich.  The beef broth was robust and tasty and everyone was content with each of their meals, Jennifer refilled our drinks on time and she helped make a great time.",

We took a while to decide if we were going to eat there or somewhere else, but the waitress still seemed to frequently disappear.  Once we ordered it took a bit of time for the food to come out. Luckily my friend noticed my nachos had been made but just sat under the heat lamp at the nacho bar next to the liquid bar. While I was in the restroom and the food was delivered, she tried a nacho and immediately sent them back since they had already lost their freshness! The manager apologized and the second nacho batch was fresh and crisp. Everyone else was pleased with their food choices.  The bathroom was clean and in good working order, but the dining room seemed very dirty. The seating in bar area just seemed crammed together and didn't give you much elbow room.",

The ladies, at the front of the restaurant, graciously directed me to the bar. However the guy behind the bar (Brandon) was rather rude. I was having trouble understanding an order that was placed through the app on my phone and I asked him if he understood it. I completely understand that it was not his job to help me decipher it; however, there's a way that you speak to people when you are conducting business. This is what he said, \"If you don't understand your own stuff, how do you think I'm going to understand it...it's your stuff and you should know your own stuff. If y'all don't know your own stuff, I don't know what to tell you.\" While he was saying this (in front of a customer) his body language represented his frustration with me. I get that he was busy and didn't have a lot of time between customer requests, but his actions were very unprofessional.  I got the feeling that he was tired and irritated (judging by his response). I responded to his rudeness with a smile which seemed to end his mild rant. Meanwhile the customer that witnessed his rudeness kept looking at the both of us. I guess she was wondering if I was going to humor him by responding negatively. I've worked in customer service for years and I was not about to let his actions affect me. I waited a very long time for my order, but not once did I question the wait time because I could see they were busy and it was two days after Christmas. I wrote the words \"secret shopper also\" on the recipient that I signed. I don't know if he saw what I wrote but his attitude changed for the better. I was not treated rudely by anyone else at that restaurant except him. Everyone else was very pleasant.",

When our food came we ordered more drinks and then we watched them sit at the bar for probably 10-15 minutes while our waitress very slowly strolled by at least 3-4 times and slowly cleaned off some tables and ignored us.

Seriously! Also the dining room is a mess and their registers went down and we had to wait for our food order to be put through once the system rebooted.  Will not be revisiting.",

It was very slow for a Friday night, and we were seated right away.  It took a while to get service, and when we did we were met with a lovely server. Unfortunately, she was very slow the entire meal at getting back to us. We all finished our beers and waters, THEN had to flag her down to get more drinks. She was not very aware of us, and didn't seem to have more than 3-4 tables total.  The food was good, but they don't know much about gluten free foods. First, the server told us that the burgers had bread crumbs in them... REALLY? Then her manager told her that they were all meat and gluten free. I did risk it and eat a burger, which was quite tasty.  If you have good company, the time will pass fast, but boy do they need to train their servers at this location. Slowest service I've had in a long time.",
