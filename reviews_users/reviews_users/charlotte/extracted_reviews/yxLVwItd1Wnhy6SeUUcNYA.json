This is by far not your average pub, the food is fantastic. I have had several of their create your own hamburgers and they are cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. The garlic tots are awesome and something different other than french fries. They have a good beer selection including seasonal/local options as well. The service was spectacular and the restaurant/bar area is separate enough that it is also family friendly.",

I make it a point to stop in whenever I'm home. During the day you'll find families eating in the dining room and at night the typical crowd is local twenty/thirty-somethings. Not quite a dive bar, not quite a sports bar. There is generally live acoustic music on the weekends and trivia is every Tuesday. Trivia night really brings out the local characters and can get competitive. The first ones to the bar on gamedays get first pick of what games go the bigscreens in the bar, kinda cool. My only complaint is the location- I wish it were stand-alone and not in a stripmall. Try the fried pickles!",

I ordered the chicken ceasar wrap but I observed the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, Bill's Fish sandwich, and one of the burgers that my colleagues ordered. They all looked really good - lots of food. Service was prompt and the wait staff were pleasant and nice. It was a little pricey for me but given the amount of food/portions it is probably about right.   When we received our bill I was surprised and confused about a service charge that appeared to be about 20%. My chicken wrap meal with water was up at $12.45 with the cost and the $2.00 service charge. I didn't understand the service charge and it wasn't explained to me so I can only speculate that it was put on our bill because we had them split the ticket among the five patrons; seems like an excessive amount to charge for splitting a ticket. I can't be going to The Lodge for lunches if it's going to cost nearly $15 with tipeach time. There are plenty of places around that will deliver food just as good for $10 or less.",

    "text": "Maybe we just hit this place on a bad night, but you'd think on a Saturday night a restaurant would be on top of their game. I'm giving it two stars instead on one because of the six of us that went, one guy liked his wings and salad.  We ordered and the dining area was virtually empty. It took almost 30 minutes just to have an app order arrive at the table. The only app served early were the Jalapeno poppers, and they looked like a sad basket with a half dozen tiny pepper nuggets. OMB Cheese dip and a spinach dip arrived at the same time as the wings, salad and a wrap almost ten minutes ( now about 40 into the meal ) later.  The OMB cheese dip should be called Salty Fondue. Tried the corn dog basket, three corn dogs that at least had some mass to them ( twice as much food easily as the Jalapeno popper basket ) but the corn dog coating had virtually no flavor. It was like corn starch and baking powder. No seasoning to the batter, nothing to pop the corn flavor. Waitstaff seemed a bit disorganized. A kid from the kitchen served the dip appetizers, and spilled a decent portion onto the floor next to the booth while trying to carry everything. The puddle ( not a couple of drops, a definite puddle ) remained on the floor next to the booth the entire meal.  This used to be a an Irish pub, and the food was spot on. Totally disappointed with this change and hope they can make the food as solid as the interior remodel looks.   A for Beer. D for Food.",

The fried fish sandwich was terrible and I couldn't eat it. The bun was grilled and hard as a rock and the tartar sauce tasted like nothing but lemon juice (and I love lemon!). I tried taking the fish out of bun and eating it plain and even that wasn't good (maybe it was old?). My friend had a burger and he said it was OK but he wouldn't order it again....  Took forever to get drink refills.  Another place to mark off my list :(",

    "text": "We went to the Lodge for the first time on a Friday night. I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat, but I knew I wanted to find a new place (new to me) in South Charlotte, so I took a bunch of spins on Urban Spoon, until this place came up. It looked like a cool casual place, which was just what we were in the mood for. Since it was a Friday night, there was a little bit of a wait, but not too bad, maybe about 20 minutes.The atmosphere was robust! They had a bunch of tvs over the bar, as well as back by the tables. The NCAA tournament was going on, so every television was turned to either one of those games, or SportsCenter.   I ordered the build it yourself burger. I got the bison burger, with cheese, wasabi may, and jalapenos. Much to my surprise (and delight), it came with huge, FRESH, jalapenos. It was cooked just right, and it was delicious.   My husband ordered the cuban, and although I didn't have a bite myself, he said it was good.  Both of us got the garlic tots on the side, and they were delicious. Also, there were tons of them; I couldn't even finish them. We could have split the side order for sure.  The service is what you would expect in a sports bar type atmosphere; attentive enough, but not fussy.  I will definitely go back, and would recommend this place when in the mood for a burger!",

First, the service was horrible. It took nearly 10 minutes to get water. My wife ordered a burger well done. When it came out it was very pink in the middle. Sent it back and it still came out pink and no fries. We were assured fresh fries were coming. 15 minutes passed before we were checked on again. Waitress forgot to get us fries. We had to wait another 10 minutes for fries. After we we were done we asked for check and it took nearly 10 minutes for the check and the only reason we got it was because my wife had to stand up and go to the hostess! We will not be coming back.",

When the food came home the BBQ sliders were awesome, the RoRo dip was delicious, but the wings were dry and tasteless. I called to just notify them that wings didn't taste good and when the gentleman that answered the phone asked me what was wrong I started telling him and he then cut me off to tell me that their wings have never had a complaint and that people have told him they're the best in town. Now, if he had given me the opportunity to actually finish my comment I was going to tell him that everything else was amazing and that I wasn't asking for anything, I just wanted to let him know that they seemed a little off. Unfortunately, he decided to tell me that I was being rude when I said I wasn't calling to argue with him so because of this direct interaction at 12:30PM on Sunday, December 20th (sharing this so you can find out who he was) I have rated them as a 1 Star for his lack of customer service and willingness to even let me speak. We eat out at least 3 nights a week and just moved literally 5 minutes down the road, because of this person we will never give this place a chance again. If you can't even listen to some constructive feedback and then tell me I'm rude when you cut me off over the phone, then you don't deserve the ridiculous amount of money we spend eating out every week when we are literally in your backyard.",

It was great to have choices! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because in a restaurant as small as this one, live music can be overwhelming. We love live music but found it tough to talk during dinner because it was so loud. Maybe next time we will go on a night where there isn't live music, sit outside, or go on a night when we want to listen to live music instead of have a conversation. Overall, though, good experience!",

This used to be my favorite local bar to visit when I'm in Charlotte (which is often). Today my mom and I stopped in to The Lodge, and I had my little puppy in my arms. Now I've had a dog for almost 2 years and I know that most restaurants don't allow dogs inside. I've also been to The Lodge with my dog many times and am fully aware that they do allow dogs on the patio. We walked in the front door and headed directly to the patio door, as I always do. The bartender Eric saw us and screamed, literally yelled at the top of his lungs, \"GET OUT OF HERE! NO DOGS ALLOWED!! CODE VIOLATION!!\" and came charging at us with his finger pointing in our faces. I asked him not to yell and he said it was loud in there, but believe me, it was not loud enough to warrant that volume and that level of anger and hostility. It was seriously scary.  The silver lining here is that we left immediately and found out that the restaurant next door, Brooklyn Pizza Parlor, has a lovely patio, wine and beer, great food, and most importantly, a very dog-friendly and human-friendly staff. They welcomed us to walk through the restaurant with my doggy to their patio. So thanks, Eric! Also, FYI, Eric is about 6' tall, white guy with a bald head in his early 40's. So if you see him, give him some hell for us. ;-)",

It's not cheap for what it is.  But it is good.  Here ends the positive portion of the review.  Been several times.  Service seems to be slow or barely passable no matter whether they are busy or dead.  I guess that they staff up and down to the minute based on demand so that things are equally slow no matter what.    Prices are high for what you get.  They're not high, per se.  But food is not abundantly supplied.  If you pay for a sandwich and side you will get JUST enough to satisfy an average adult appetite.  Not a man's appetite.  Or a hungry person's appetite.  You get enough food to satisfy the expectation of a reasonable (though small) portion.    The worst issue really is that of service.  If you go, do not 'over expect'.  And recognize that service is slow and really just barely meets the definition of service.  Also, don't go when you're super hungry.  Or if you do, get a snack on the way.",

I wouldn't come here for the food, but if you are looking for a good selection of beer both on draft and in the bottle, this is for you.",

We went on a Friday and they had a wait - so don't go starving.  They have a great (local) beer selection - including my personal fave OMB. We started with the Chicken Egg Rolls, which were delish. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but they were really fresh - ingredients-wise and made to order. For my main, I tried the Spicy Shrimp Wrap with Pineapple Salsa and Avocado....definitely wayyyy above average bar food. There were lots of good options on the menu, so I want to go back and try a couple more.   Just wish it was closer to home, but it's on the list for \"better\" bar food places!",

They also have a great local beer selection - most of the local breweries have a beer or two on tap, which is awesome!  We ordered the jalapeno poppers as our starter and they we delicious. It comes with 6 poppers, which is perfect for an app. I got the cuban sandwich with a side of mac n cheese.  The sandwich was perfect and the mac and cheese was too - can be hit or miss at some places.  My husband got the philly cheesesteak and loved it. He wasn't too impressed with the coleslaw he got on the side - I tried some and I was with him on that.  The coleslaw was pretty bland and a weird texture - not the usual shredded cabbage that coleslaw is made with, so aside from that, I would recommend anything else!  Can't wait to go back and try out more food!",

It's a local neighborhood bar with a bit of an older crowd, but their burgers will dance on anyone's tastebuds. The bar area is large and first-come-first serve. It's a quick spot to sit when there's a long line with the only downside being the service gets slow. I ordered a beer burger, medium rare, that was cooked perfectly. Our waiter prided himself in not using a pad to write our orders down, and to his chagrin, he got my order wrong. Additionally, our bills were all wrong at the end of the meal, with additional charges on all three. BUT, if you can overlook that, they have some delicious food, highly recommend a burger and the sweet potato fries. You'll hear live music on Friday nights and can spice up your life with some $3 mystery beers [i.e. they randomly grab a beer from the cooler for you, and you better be happy!]. Overall, a tasty, low-key spot and one that I'd return to despite the slow service.",

Jessica was our server and she was so busy but she always knew when to come by our table. We ordered the jalapeno poppers for an appetizer and they were served hot and served quickly. For lunch we ordered 2 dozen wings, they were so good. Crispy and seasoned just right. We ended up ordering more drinks and watched the rest of the game. The atmosphere is perfect for Charlotte sports. We enjoyed ourselves especially since all of the servers came by our table at some point to make sure we had everything we needed. The prices aren't outrageous and the portions are huge. Will definitely be back.",

The veggie burger was the worst thing I have ever received at a restaurant, it was as if they blended veggies in a food processor, put it on a flat grill like a pancake and served it as a veggie burger. The consistency was runnier than a traditional pancake and can't believe it was allowed to be sent out of the kitchen, it didn't even remotely resemble a patty. Everyone else's food was below average and we all agreed we will not be back.",

The atmosphere is nice, too; sporty with lots of memorabilia adorning the walls and customer-written graffiti on the walls and chalkboards but not in a chain-restaurant-flair sort of way. I had a buffalo chicken wrap, which was good.

On the first visit my girlfriend got the blackened salmon wrap. She didn't care for it but I loved it. Just thinking about it actually makes my mouth water. On our second visit we got salads which were okay. I generally give the place good marks for the food and the trivia. The beer selection is also great. You'll certainly find something to drink, even quite unique things like Delirium.  Where I felt they lacked the most was in the service. On both visits the bartenders and waiter were virtually non-existent. In particular when waiting for the check. We intended to ask for the check as soon as we finished eating and well before the end of trivia in order to be ready to leave when trivia was done and miss the rush. However from the moment we got our food we could never get ahold of a server again. Not sure what it was, work ethic or just being understaffed. Maybe they'd be better on other nights, though they were never crowded. The prices aren't the greatest either when compared to the service and quality of food. It's pricey and I think that's just taking advantage of the neighborhood. The crowd is older and you see a lot of \"old regulars\" in here too.  Still the trivia is great and the host is a super nice guy. I would recommend getting in here for trivia at least once. But we don't plan to go back again because of the service and the high prices.",

We arrived at 6 PM Party of 6 adults and three Babies...We were told that it would be a 20 to 30 minute wait but they assured us that they could get us all at ONE table. We were all standing at the front of the restaurant I myself had just had a Total Hip Replacement 3 weeks before. The 20 minutes turned into 1 HOUR and 20 MINUTES. We checked with the hostess over and over. She then informed us that we would be sitting at TWO SEPARATE tables!! Which Obviously we could have done 1 HOUR and TWENTY MINUTES previous!! As we sat down, breaking up our party there was a four top that they sat two People at, right next to one of our tables. We asked the hostess if she could move the people to the other table so at least we could be closer since we had waited so long. She said she was not allowed to do that since the other table was a five top!. Now I have worked in a restaurant and I understand Seating, but this was a special situation, it was a celebration and we had been very patient for ONE HOUR and 20 MINUTES. My daughter asked if she could speak to the manager. He ( a young man in a baseball hat) approached us, did not introduce himself and asked what was the matter. We explained at least three times to him the facts about our long wait and that the two top that was sat right next to us was willing to move to the bigger table, so that WE WHO HAD WAITED SO LONG could be accommodated. He did not understand. He kept saying, no he would lose money that way. I said You will be getting the same amount if we stayed at the same tables or switched?? He did not listen and he made no restitution such as buying us a appetizer or dessert or even an APOLOGY! Just Stupid Management who did not teach the hostesses about seating nor the Manager about the CUSTOMER SERVICE. We stayed and ate..No celebration.We will not be returning now. and I warn you, if you have a big party and you want to sit together, GO TO A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT!",

    "text": "Absoltuly the worst dining experience!! We had a party of 6 adults and 3 children in high chairs. We were told it would be a 20 - 30 minute wait. We waited an hour and 20 minutes, and were then told we would have to sit separate. REALLY? They should have let us know that before waited an hour and 20 minutes. At this point we had no choice as everyone was hungry. They then separated us to 2 tables that were not remotely close together. We noticed an extra table right next to us, and right as we went to tell them, they sat a party of 2 at a 4 person right next to one of our tables- which they should have put us at from the get go and pushed them together. When I asked to speak to the manager to kindly ask if he could move us to that table so we could sit together, he was not the LEAST BIT helpful. He was a young dark haired guy in a baseball hat. He was a complete jerk about it, not understanding or nice, and not what a manager should be.  And to top it off, we decided to stay and eat since our kids were starving- and 2 of our orders came out wrong- one was the special written on the front of the board and was missing all the components listed for it! Absolutely terrible. Do yourself a favor and DONT COME HERE, especially if you have hungry kids. Very disappointed.",

Heavy pours are never bad for a paying customer, right?!  Busy place even late at night and it was a good environment topped off by good live music!",

    "text": "We showed up on a Friday at 6:30 with a family of three. After a 5 minute wait for the hostess we asked to sit outside.  The hostess told us that they were not seating anyone outside due to the POSSIBILITY of rain. The sky was blue...  Even though there were 2 tables already seated outside which there was no explanation. We were asked if we would like to wait on a table inside. We said no we would rather go anywhere else at this point.  So we drove one mile down the road and had a great dinner on a patio outside under the blue sky. It was August 31st at 6:30.  We have always enjoyed the lodge but will never go back.  Sorry for the rain that never happened",

    "text": "We've seen \"The Lodge - A Sportman's Grill\" several times when we've been in the Harris Teeter shopping plaza at the corner of Rea and Colony, but we've never gone because it sounded too woodsy and bar-like.  I was searching for Yelp on someplace new for us to go and saw that The Lodge had good reviews, the photos of the inside looked nice, and the menu looked good, too, so we decided to give it a try.  We've now visited The Lodge for dinner twice in two weeks.    The atmosphere is casual, lively, and fun, the prices are great, and there are a variety of menu options, including daily blue plate specials for around $11.  There are a variety of sandwich options, too, and even a good selection of entree salads.  The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating, but there can be a wait on busy weekend nights because it's not a huge restaurant.  There's a good-sized bar area, too.    Our first visit, I built my own bison burger with toppings and had the yummy garlic tots as my side.  We also split the RoRo's Wing Dip as an appetizer.  If you love chicken wings and cheese but never made this at home, try it here and you'll be hooked.  It was a little spicy for the others at the table, but perfect for me.    On our second visit, I was in the mood for a BIG salad (a la Seinfeld), and The Lodge delivered with the Cobb Salad, one of many salad options.  Their salads are BIG and a full meal in themselves.    One of the kids ordered the Baby Back Ribs Blue Plate Special.  It was a FULL rack of ribs.  HUGE.  He's got a big appetite and it was very satisfying.  Some Friday, we'll come back and try the Fish Fry, a Northern favorite. :)  We'll definitely be back to The Lodge again and again for high quality, reasonably priced meals and drinks.",

Sometimes the collard greens taste like pure vinegar, other times they're too salty, sometimes the broccoli is fresh and beautiful other times it's a weird light yellow instead of a bright green when it comes out. Leave the salt for the customers and try to be more consistent, please. On the flipside, their salads are fresh and plentiful, and rib night is out of this world.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE place to go. I went here for a friends memorial after he passed a year ago because this was one of his favorite places. We had a big group and naturally moved some tables together. Before we could do this, Melissa, a bar tender, came running over so aggressively saying MOVE THESE BACK you can't do this. There was way more to what she said...I said there's no need to be rude and we will move them back and apologized. She then decided to refuse service to myself and friends. Eric, the manager was just as bad when I called complaining at the utter nerve and disrespect. I will NEVER come back to this place ever again. These people do not think the customer is right and are so disrespectful. Please do not waste your money here. Disgusting humans and I'm so ashamed my friends and I came to that place to remember a dear friend of ours.",

I like spicy, so I ordered my burger with pepper jack cheese, japalenos, onion rings, bacon and the \"Lodge\" sauce.  The burger was absolutely delicious.  They could have put more \"Lodge\" sauce on, but overall, the burger was great.  The garlic tots were wonderful.  They were very cripsy and not too greasy.  I couldnt eat all my food, so I took half home and heated it up for lunch on Sunday.  Everything even heated up well. We go to lunch every Saturday, normally we kinda rotate between the same places we have been eating at for years. We will definitely be adding The Lodge to our list of places.",
