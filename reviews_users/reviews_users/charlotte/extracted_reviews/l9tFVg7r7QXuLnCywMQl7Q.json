The White Bean & Quinoa Burger was delicious and the bloody mary was the best I've had in Charlotte. The mix is house-made and a bit spicy, but not overdone. They have a couple vegan and vegetarian options available, and plenty of good beers on tap (Deshutes Fresh Squeezed IPA and Birdsong Jalapeno for the win!) as well as some local favs in cans. The atmosphere is dim lit and very tavern-like, but I dig it. Our server was great and very attentive. I can't wait to visit the patio when we go back!",

The menu is short and trying to appeal to all kinds which means most will only find a few entrees if interest. I ended up getting the burger which was hearty but lacked any real distinctive taste. Also tried to order the fried pickles but was told they had just run out (on a Friday at 7:30). But upon further discussion found out that mean the chef didn't think they were good enough and was not serving them in this night, so I'll give kudos for that. Ended up being in and out in 30 minutes. I will be back but will also give it some time to see if the place evolves. Given some of the other places this group owns I think this will be a winner but needs to figure out what they want to be.",

Great spot for food and a few drinks.  Only things to consider is that its not a spot for game-watching (TVs are small and few) and the lighting is on the very dim-side, could use turning up a bit.  All in all really enjoyed it though.",

I thought this place was a spot worthy of have a night cap on the way home, while at a real watering hole. Now I know that this place is actually worth less than a place to scrape the mud off of my boots nor does it had the staff to wish me a good evening  on a otherwise flawless night. Truly, your place is slightly more respectable than the pig-stile that I was raised in.  Good evening,  Your friending LSU HILLBILLY.",

The beer selection is really extensive, they have cool signature cocktails, but they are all on the sweet side so be prepared for that They allow dogs on the outside patio which now has seats too, so that's been great for us to stop by for a drink or snack while out walking our pup!  Cons: The food can be inconsistent. In the past 5-6 times we have been here, the wings are a staple that we order. I'd say the last 2-3 times they came out in like 3 minutes after we put the order in, and they were cold and had a funky aftertaste? I dunno if maybe a lot of them get cooked at once and they just sit under a warmer? For what they charge for 6-7 wings and garnish, I'd gladly wait the few extra minutes to get them fresh fried?  Aside from the food though, this is definitely a place where you could walk in during the day, have drinks and hang out, and not even realize it's already the evening. Great dive bar vibe, I'd recommend checking it out if you live in the area.",

Four of our six meals were brought out almost an hour of being seated. But all four were wrong. All were taken back, but even then all of redos were wrong as we checked on them. The manager apologized and took two of the meals off our bill but it was not enough  to compensate for all the headache.

Blows me away how unattentive and careless the bartender was especially since he literally makes money off tips. My biggest pet peeve is a server or bartender with a bad attitude or horrible customer service skills since we the customers are the ones giving them money which they live off!",

I was able to sample a couple beers which was great because I hated them both lol but all in all I found a beer that I liked. My friend ordered the Chicken Club and I had their Daily Mail Burger. LET ME SAY THIS WAS HANDS DOWN THE BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD! My friend said that her chicken club was absolutely delicious. The cost of a sweet tea, beer, and 2 entrees ran me about $30. With tip you're looking around $35-$37. I wish they were a little faster with coming out with the food, but it was worth the wait. Next time we are in town we will definitely stop by. Oh and they Validate parking! Between 10a",

He had the pot pie for dinner and loved it while I had the burger with shoestring fried and it was all wonderful.  Andrew was super friendly, as always.  We will definitely be going back to try some of the other foods and check out the fri/sat night DJs!  Great new gem uptown.",

Landon was a great server, the food came out quickly, the beer and cocktail selection (we didn't try any wines) was great and their vegetarian options were fantastic. They do a white bean burger and instead of serving it with fries, they automatically serve it with a side of veggies (carrots and cauliflower) because the fries are cooked in animal fat. The burger was great and the consideration of vegetarians was very thoughtful. We'll definitely be back next time we are uptown!",

    "text": "Mama Bear left the cubs back in Cali and headed to North Carolina with my aunt to visit some family. On one of our ventures out, we ended up at The Daily. One of the things that drew me in was the variety in the menu-a nice beer list, cocktails and wine (I don't like being pigeon-holed in terms of my liquor, especially if I'm not craving anything in particular). Walking in, the place is dark and cool (the AC was on blast which was quite refreshing since it was a warm day). It was not very crowded so we were able to sit in a nice booth inside (although there is also seating outside). So, what's good?  Try both of the wings (hot and BBQ-they are delicious, especially if you need something to soak up those beers or cocktails). Try the fried pickles (extra crispy dipped in ranch is pretty cool). Being from the west coast, trying appetizers like fried pickles is a nicety. I also had a salad with strawberries, walnuts, etc. and it was so good. In terms of drinks, my aunt ordered a chocolate cake shot (she threw back three in a row which tells me that they were probably really good!). The Mexican Mocha (a hot cocktail) was quite bitter (if you're looking for sweet, this is not the hot cocktail for you). You can really taste the liquor though, so if you're in to strong, bitter, hot cocktails, this is for you (not so much me...). I ended up ordering a cider which was refreshing on a warm June day in Charlotte and made up for my sweet tooth by ordering the Chocolate Pot for dessert. The cocktails are around $12, but they run daily specials during Happy Hour, so don't forget to ask about it.   Nice vibe, good selection of beverages and appetizers and great service. If you are in Charlotte, check them out.   Tip: there is a parking structure right next to the bar (cost: $3 for first 20 minutes and $3 for each additional 20 minutes, but The Daily does not validate).",

The interior is perfect- great long Bar and then high tables all around (this is key). Candles everywhere. Had a killer chicken pot pie. Nice draft beer selection. Music that was playing was a great selection AND played at a proper volume. Very cozy place with some cool patio options as well. Tvs here and there but doesn't overwhelm the intended atmosphere. Really well done- I go out all the time at a wide variety of bars and restaurants. And after talking with the owner I can tell why this place gets it--it all starts with good management. Nice job Andrew! Their \"#settlein\" is perfect!",

    "text": "What a charming little place.  Our server, Christi,  was absolutely fabulous.  Not being from Charlotte we were still finding our way around town.  She was knowledgeable about the area and took the time to chat with us (who does that?)  The charcuterie was just the right amount for two and the mimosa's were delightful.  We enjoyed the fried pickles as an appetizer. Yum! The tavern does have an inhouse dj which you can hear from the patio.  This is a sports bar so there is a good view of a tv screen from just about any table. We found this place charming and if we ever find ourselves back in Charlotte we will most definitely spend some time here.",

I got a salad which was very short on the amount of bacon.... and very heavy in the dressing. I may have just ordered wrong (and maybe a little boring).  Overall though it was a fine experience... I would go back. The fried pickles were quite yummy.",

    "text": "We were looking for a nice restaurant in Uptown with a good range of food options and saw this place had a lot of good reviews so we gave it a try. We sat out on their side patio which wasn't necessarily super open but you still got a breeze. It was more like a side room with some open windows. They have a ton of TVs which definitely makes it a nice place to watch a game but didn't have a sports bar feel which I really liked. We started with their fried pickles which luckily did not go in the same fryer as their fries. Their fries are cooked in fat so not vegetarian friendly. The pickles were delicious. We were starving so my friend and I easily polished them off. We each got a smaller entree. She got their Cobb salad and I got the veggie bowl. The veggie bowl was great! The grain was farro which is super filling and satisfying and there was a great representation of different vegetables. Our server was super helpful and our food revived us. I wish they had more vegetarian options as I would probably have to keep ordering the same meal but all around great spot for dinner.",

    "text": "Three stars is about all I can do for The Daily Tavern for now.    The restaurant is clean, staff members friendly. The decor is characteristic of a speak easy but with a rustic tavern spin. There is plenty of seating, but it was not that busy during a Saturday morning brunch.   The pro of brunch here is definitely the mimosa bar. That was fabulous. You get the glass of prosecco and you go to the mimosa bar to choose your juice. They have orange, pear, peach, etc. There are is a selection of fresh fruit to jazz it up as well. We visited the mimosa bar a couple of times this brunch.   The negative was the extremely limited options for a vegan. I ended up getting the avocado toast with no egg and bacon. Which was one slice of toast with avocado spread on it. I would like to see some additional options to spice brunch up for a vegan. That's just a personal preference leading me to suggest.   Staff was overall friendly and tentative. As my friends and I had been chatting and sitting around with mimosas, a server came up to tell us they were putting a reserved group where we were. She offered to seat us elsewhere in the restaurant. This was not unheard of since we had been there a while catching up. But we were paying customers and I would just like the offer to move us be a statement not a question that comes after saying a new group would be there within moments. She did do her best to be polite, and we were definitely understanding and recognized she did her best with that situation.    I am sure we will return for another brunch since we all live near, but I would hope to see some added menu items for alternative diets soon!",

Once you start eating them, you won't have room for much else.    I would recommend starting with the beef jerky, though.  It's a great way to enjoy a snack while you sip on a cocktail. The beef jerky and the white cheddar biscuits were the highlight for me.    The cocktails and wings were fine, but I would come back here for the beef jerky and biscuits, with a couple of drinks.",

There are others that  are a little bigger. Okay for the casual sports fan.   Really loud if you are over 37 and four months. Acoustics issue i think. Sometimes thI bartender can't hearMusic is great though.   Wings - one sauce to rule them all? It is a good sauce but it tries to be spicy, zesty and yummy.  I can pull that off but the sauce doesn't. Give me a few choices dammit!  Everything else is great. Bartenders are one of the best crews in Uptown which says a lot. Collectively they are smart, professional, knowledgeable, funny and hot.   Strong food options. Really enjoyed the pot pie, gnocchi, oysters and chopped salad over the course of several visits.   Beer selection is excellent and includes many locals. Only tried one of their cocktails. It was good but too sweet for me.   Love The Daily!  So this place has been open for a while since my first review.  We live one block away and happy to say we still give five stars.   We still come for the drinks and the food. More often than not, we order the pot pie and the wings. The biscuit are to die for. Their strawberry jam on a biscuit is heaven. We also occasionally enjoy Brunch.   The bartender staff has changed but they are in great hands with Papa. Living in uptown, you get to know the best bartenders/servers. There are some great people everywhere but I can say without pause that  none of them are nicer and more customer service focused than Papa. He always remembers us and the second we walk through the door, he is greeting us. There is no one who treats their customers better.   If you want to go where the locals go for great food and great service, The Daily is that place.",

I always find that many restaurants in uptown Charlotte are either too busy or too upscale for what I'm usually looking for, but the Daily Tavern really hit the spot! The atmosphere is very cozy, even though there is lots of room for seating. They also have quite a few TVs if you're looking for a game!  We shared the olives and bread while deciding because everything sounded so delicious. I ended up ordering the crab and bacon gnocchi, which was honestly one of the best soups I have ever had. You can't go wrong with gnocchi, and theirs is amazing! My husband had the roasted chicken club, which looked great as well.  We will definitely be returning to try more next time we're in town.

We opted to sit outside since it was really warm outside, and it was a perfect decision (I ALWAYS get cold inside places).   Anyways, I ordered the French Toast minus bacon, and my bf ordered southern benedict. I loved the french toast especially because the fruit and french toast pair so perfectly. I wasn't a fan of the apples since I don't like apples, but I still ate them.   The only thing I have to complain about is the mimosa that I ordered. First off, I don't understand why there is a $1 charge to change the juice. I don't like OJ in my mimosa, I like other juices like grapefruit, strawberry, peach mango, or literally any other juice. Our waitress mentioned how there was a mimosa bar (which was way more expensive), but I didn't want to do that because I literally just wanted one or two if I really liked it. I asked for a Mango Mimosa knowing there would be an added charge to it, and then the waitress told me if I wanted another non-standard mimosa, she would charge me for the mimosa bar. So dumb. To my luck, the champagne that they use was WAYYYY too bubbly for me, and I didn't even enjoy it enough to order another one.   I would recommend for food though!",

I know this place has been several different bars in past 10 years but I'm really hoping this one sticks around.  I love the vintage vibes of the place very cool.  The two bartenders Angel and Papa I think their names were. They went above and beyond to make us have a great experience!  Hats off to them, we will definitely be back because of that!!! Would love to try their food next time for sure, menu looked appealing...LOVED THE HOMEMADE BEEF JERKY!!!!!",

    "text": "Great food, fantastic atmosphere, and an amazing staff. So basically, it's what you would expect from the Best Bars Group (the same people behind Dandelion, Workman's Friend, Tyber Creek, Connolly's).  I think I've tried pretty much the entire menu by now. I love the beef jerky as a snack. The crab & bacon gnocchi is probably my favorite entree. Pot pie and the Butcher's Cut are both delicious. Pro tip on the Roasted Chicken Club: ask for it as a regular sandwich. You don't need that extra piece of bread in the middle. And as Isaiah W noted, it comes with a mountain of shoestring like fries. Plenty to share. My latest visit, our server recommended the Drunken Clams as a shareable starter for the table. She nailed it with that, such an underrated hidden gem of the menu. Make sure you dip that bread into the broth. So yum.   Speaking of our server from last night, shout out to Lexie! Such a delight. I have never had a bad experience here, the service is always top notch.   Drink-wise, I love all their warm bevvies during the cold months. The Cold Winter and Hot Apple Jerry are my two favs. Don't worry, they have PBR and Coors Banquet as well.  Parking: The Daily now validates for the Fifth Third deck.",

    "text": "My colleague-friends and I enjoyed an incredible late night meal at The Daily Tavern last night. First off, the restaurant is really cool; it's long and narrow inside and has an adjoining covered patio area which is where we decided to sit. There are lots of TVs both inside and out, which was great for catching up on some sports.   We knew we were in great hands with our server, Lexi (hopefully I'm spelling that correctly!). She offered great suggestions and was on top of every drink refill or other need throughout our visit. We started with fried pickles and clams, both perfect for sharing. The fried pickles were plentiful and served in a basket with a side of ranch for dipping. The clams were in a delicious beer broth with crumbled sausage. Sliced baguette was served on the side - perfect for dipping.   There were so many great choices on the menu, it was hard to decide. I opted for the butcher's cut, a sliced skirt steak which was tender and super flavorful. It was served with garlic mash and asparagus. It was fantastic! Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals as well.   As we were preparing to leave, Lexi asked if anyone wanted to take a soft drink to go. I'm staying in a hotel so this kind gesture was greatly appreciated and I happily took her up on some club soda.   I'm so impressed by Charlotte's dining scene and The Daily Tavern is a restaurant I'd love to visit again next time I'm in town!",

Last time we just popped in for a few drinks and gave their delicious picklebacks a shot (pun intended).   This time we were very very hungry so decided to do a couple of shareable starters and then each ordered an item from the main dishes section. The Drunken Oysters and Fried Pickles to start were incredible and so so tasty. Everyone at the table was blown away and they should definitely be on list if you have interest in Oysters or Pickles.   My main dish I went with the chicken club and oh my goodness it was one of the best sandwiches I've had. It also came out with a mountain full of string fries and they were great as well! I would definitely tell anyone nearby to give them a shot. The staff is great and our server Lexi was extremely friendly, diligent and helpful. Thanks again!",

It was later in the evening maybe 9pm or so and when we first arrived we were probably 2 of 15 people here which after navigating the crowds to get here we didn't  mind.  Eventually the crowd picked up and the staff kicked into high gear which was really cool to watch. I couldn't resist getting the beef jerky as a snack. It was very tender, but just a little too salty for my personal preference.  I would order it again and bank on the idea that maybe I just had a salty batch.   The rest of our food was on par with what you'd expect from ine if the better bars in CLT.   The drinks were tasty and made with flare.   Definitely a place I'd go to again!",

The serving size was generous and taste was perfection. The short ribs were a miss for me though. I was excited to try the interesting blueberry barbecue combo flavor, but it was odd. The slaw, however, was good and exactly the tangy flavor I expected from NC. You also can't go wrong with the shoestring fries. They too were cooked to crispy warm perfection.",

It was a Sunday and much to my surprise was operating more as a night club rather than a restaurant (this was around 5pm). Because the music was so intense I opted to sit on the patio to enjoy a little post show meal.  The food is delicious. For an appetizer I had the muscles which were in an amazin rich and buttery broth. For dinner it was comfort food with the chicken pot pie. My portion had a good dose of protein and went down quickly! The biscuit topping was also so so delicious.   Brief menu, but I liked that. Great beer and drink list. Just a little bit of a funny atmosphere. You wouldn't post up here for a football game with Club Daily in the background. Not sure if it's like that ever Sunday. I would definitely try it again on another day.",

My friends and I arrived around 1:30PM (no wait time). I expected the bar to be packed, only a few tables were occupied. We choose to sit at the bar, the bartender was most informative. To our delight mimosas were special for $5! Yesss!!   I ordered the chicken wings--A perfect game day appetizer! I must say these were the best wings I've had in a long time. The flavor was amazing! Baked, fried, then tossed in a homemade hot sauce. The wings weren't too spicy, I liked the crisp texture. We also orders the White Cheddar biscuits with honey butter and peppered jelly. I didn't care for the peppered jelly much.   Overall, I look forward to visiting \"The Daily\" again soon.",

I ordered my fave cognac with a splash of ginger and lime. THE ONLY REASON they received this 3 is due to those drinks. They were very weak and tasted watered down. I assumed it was just that one so I ordered another one however this time a whiskey and spritzer. Still very weak! This really bummed me out as I love a good drink however THE PORK RIBS!!! OMG!!

I love the way the bar is decorated and laid out, but keep in mind that the space is very dark (only a couple of windows) so I personally think it's best for a bad weather day or sometime in the Fall or Winter when you're looking for some place warm. We grabbed four seats at the bar and the service was quick and friendly. They have a full bar, a large beer selection and about 10 different by the glass wine selections.   The food is awesome. We ordered the white cheddar biscuits to start...comes with butter and pepper jelly, so good. The chicken wings are also really good and the ranch is bomb. I love that they're served with pickled veggies. Everything else we ordered (burger with shoestring fries, fruit and nut salad with chicken, beef jerky) was really tasty and great portions.   There are TV's in the bar so I'm thinking this is a great spot for football season. We will be back!",

They have high quality tasting food without breaking your wallet and an atmosphere that works just right. We order beef jerky and wings to start for brunch as we sat out on the patio because it was a beautiful day outside. I wanted the devil eggs but they were out. Please judge me on all the meat I consumed via appetizers ... but it was so good!   The wings hands down are so balance in taste and I think The Daily Tavern is one of the top places to get wings at a none wing joint! They bake them first then fry them and add their sauce to it! Literally finger licking good but far better than KFC. The jerky was moist and had a great taste and kick to it as well.   The southern fried chicken biscuit is the way go here! It is a warm sausage gravy cooked just right and drizzled around a fluffy warm butter biscuit with the moist crunchy chicken and egg in the middle. The flavors sent my mouth into an overdrive of wonderfulness!   I highly recommend given it a try! We also got the French toast that comes with a fruit topping that was very good as well. I am definitely coming back here more often!!!   You will not be disappointed with the food or service. Hope to see you there too. Share the love if you agree.",

    "text": "What a cozy and welcoming place!  We wandered in here on a rainy Sunday afternoon for a drink and snack.  The bartender was super-friendly and helpful.  He offered several recommendations and made us feel like we were regulars.    I ordered the Daily Mary - a carrot juice bloody mary.  Honestly, I didn't love the carrot juice take on this drink - but that was just a bad order on my part.  We also ordered the meat & cheese tray - it was a generous serving of 2 cheeses, 2 meats, bread, pepper jelly, nuts and fruit.  I look forward to going back and hanging out again!",

I mean, the location is far enough from the stadium that people don't really think about it as their first choice but close enough to be less than a 10 minute walk. AND between their drink specials and hearty comfort food, it's perfect.   Yesterday was The Lady and my second time coming here, and the food, like last time, did not disappoint. Although dark inside, there's a large variety of seating between the bar, high tops, tables, and the patio (covered in the winter, yessss). Their drink special of the day was $5 Jameson drinks, which for me, came in the form of a Jameson Ginger and an Irish Mule. Kudos to the bartender who came up with more ideas for me!   Food is elevated but nowhere near pretentious - like the crab gnocchi sitting right next to a hot dog. The Lady and I wanted to share some things so we got the meat and cheese board as well as the vegetable bowl (farro, brussel sprouts, other fall-y type things). Warning, portions are BIG here. They actually split our bowl into 2 separate bowls and it *still* looked like an entree at any other restaurant. Talk about bang for your buck.   Just as a tip, they now validate parking in the nearby garage, so you don't have to deal with uptown hell as much! I'm looking forward to coming back here again on Wednesday, when they have $5 Whiskey nights. Hello, Redbreast.",

They bring you tap water in chilled green bottles that look like you're drinking Pellegrino.  Each wooden table is simply decorated with a pretty daisy and a mason jar candle.  Just the right blend of rustic and charming.  The bathrooms were immaculate!    They didn't have a lot of beers that we knew of to choose from, so the waiter suggested Palmetto.  They weren't to our liking.  But he was!  He provided terrific service.  He was fast, attentive and friendly.    The menu was rather small, and I didn't see a lot of items That weren't fried, but the prices were fair.  You get a lot of bang for your buck!  I would not hesitate to go back.",
